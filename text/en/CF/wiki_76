<text>USS &quot;Gurnard&quot; (SSN-662), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gurnard, a food fish of the genus &quot;Trigla&quot; and part of the sea robin family.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Gurnard&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 24 October 1963, and her keel was laid down there on 22 December 1964. She was launched on 20 May 1967, sponsored by Mrs. George P. Miller, and commissioned on 6 December 1968.

==Service history==
On 8 July 1972, lay in Apra Harbor completing repairs prior to a patrol in the Mariana Islands. Typhoon Rita was approaching Guam, and &quot;Barb&quot; intended to be at sea and submerged before the storm arrived. Shortly after 04:00 hours, &quot;Cobalt 2&quot;, a B-52 Stratofortress of the Strategic Air Command commanded by United States Air Force Captain Leroy Johnson, took off from Andersen Air Force Base, intending to fly over the storm. Soon after takeoff, however, the aircraft became uncontrollable, and the crew bailed out. By 05:25, the six-man crew were in the ocean. A C-97 Stratofreighter spotted the survivors, and Barb was ordered to proceed at best speed and effect rescue. At about 23:00, &quot;Barb&quot; surfaced about from the reported location. The heavy weather had already forced surface ships to turn back, and caused the round-hulled submarine to roll and corkscrew violently. It was 01:15 hours the next morning before the boat&#x27;s crew spotted the survivors&#x27; lights. They made numerous attempts to rescue the airmen through the night, but did not succeed.

By 07:40 hours, visibility had improved and the typhoon had moved from the immediate area, and the boat approached a group of three rafts. Several attempts to shoot a line to the survivors failed, so Chief Torpedoman Jon Hentz volunteered to swim to them, towing a line. At about 08:15, the rafts holding Major Ronald Dvorak, the Electronic Warfare Officer, Lieutenant William Neely III, the copilot, and Lieutenant Kent Dodson, the navigator, were secured to the submarine. Over the next hour, they were brought aboard, a task made more challenging by the waves that often exposed the submarine&#x27;s screw and the ballast tank flood grates at the bottom of the boat. At about 10:00 hours, orbiting aircraft vectored &quot;Barb&quot; to the next survivor, Airman Daniel Johansen, the aircraft&#x27;s gunner, who caught a line shot to him and was pulled aboard in less than a quarter-hour.

Meanwhile, &quot;Gurnard&quot; arrived on the scene, found Captain Leroy Johnson, the aircraft commander, and brought him aboard. Lieutenant Colonel J.L. Vaughn, the radar navigator, had not survived the night. Aircraft sighted his body floating face down, still tied to his raft.

The survivors were carried back to Guam, where each boat was presented the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and ten submariners who played perilous topside roles received individual commendations. Torpedoman Hentz received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.

&quot;Gurnard&quot; operated in the Arctic Ocean under the polar ice cap from September to November 1984 in company with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine . On 12 November 1984 &quot;Gurnard&quot; and &quot;Pintado&quot; became the third pair of submarines to surface together at the North Pole. In March 1990, &quot;Gurnard&quot; deployed to the Arctic region during exercise Ice Ex &#x27;90 and completed only the fourth winter submerged transit of the Bering Sea. &quot;Gurnard&quot; surfaced at the North Pole on 18 April, in the company of the .

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Gurnard&quot; was decommissioned on 28 April 1995 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 15 October 1997. One diving plane from the Gurnard was saved and used in a sculpture in Magnuson Park in Seattle, WA in 1998. It is entitled &quot;The Fin Project: From Swords into Plowshares&quot;

<text>Lindsay Jean Wagner (born June 22, 1949) is an American actress. Wagner is best known for her leading role in the American science fiction television series &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (1976–1978), in which she portrayed character Jaime Sommers. She first played the role on the series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. The character became a pop culture icon of the 1970s. For this role, Wagner won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Dramatic Role in 1977 – the first for an actor or actress in a science fiction series. Wagner began acting professionally in 1971 and has maintained a lengthy acting career in a variety of film and television productions to the present day.

==Early life==
Wagner was born in Los Angeles, California. Following her parents&#x27; divorce, her mother remarried, and the family moved to Portland, Oregon where Wagner graduated from Portland&#x27;s David Douglas High School.

After graduation, Wagner spent a couple of months in France before enrolling at the University of Oregon for one year. Wagner then transferred to Mt. Hood Community College, Gresham, for six months before dropping out and moving to Los Angeles. She was diagnosed with dyslexia.

==Career==
Wagner worked as a model in Los Angeles and gained some television experience by appearing as a hostess in &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot;, and she was also a contestant on the game show &quot;The Dating Game&quot; in 1969 (one of her potential suitors, whom she did not choose, was TV actor Roger Ewing). In 1971, she signed a contract with Universal Studios and worked as a contract player in Universal productions. Her primetime network television debut was in the series &quot;Adam-12&quot; (&quot;Million Dollar Buff&quot;), and she went on to appear in a dozen other Universal shows, including &quot;Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law&quot; (co-starring Lee Majors), &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Sarge&quot;, and &quot;Night Gallery&quot; (1971, as the nurse in the episode: &quot;The Diary&quot;).
Between 1971 and 1975, she appeared in five episodes of Universal&#x27;s &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; and two episodes of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. In 1973, Wagner branched into film roles when Universal cast her in &quot;Two People,&quot; which was her first feature film and her first lead role. She also co-starred in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; the same year, playing the daughter of the stern law professor, Kingsfield.
In 1975, arranged under her extended contract with Universal Studios, Wagner played the role of Jaime Sommers, a former tennis professional who was the childhood sweetheart of &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; Colonel Steve Austin (played by Lee Majors). According to Kenneth Johnson, interviewed for a featurette included in the 2010 North American DVD release of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; season one, Wagner was cast in the role based upon her appeal and spontaneity after he saw her appearance in the pilot and a follow-up episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. In the second-season, two-part episode, her character is critically injured in a skydiving accident and equipped with bionic implants similar to Austin&#x27;s, but her body rejects them, ultimately leading to her death.

This was intended to be Wagner&#x27;s last role under her Universal contract, but public response to the character was so overwhelming that the &quot;death&quot; was retconned into a cover story for a near-death secret recovery, and Wagner appeared in a two-part episode which returned her character, followed by a spin-off series, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, which debuted in January 1976. The same year, she co-starred in a Canadian film, &quot;Second Wind&quot; opposite James Naughton. She made several crossover appearances in &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; during the series&#x27; run. The role earned Wagner an Emmy Award for &quot;Best Actress in a Dramatic Role&quot; in 1977.
Following the cancellation of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; in 1978, Wagner continued to act, predominantly in television miniseries and television films. These included the highly rated 1980 miniseries &quot;Scruples&quot;, as well as three made-for-TV &quot;Bionic&quot; reunion movies with Lee Majors between 1987 and 1994. Also in the 1980s, Wagner co-starred as Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s ex-wife in his 1981 movie &quot;Nighthawks&quot; and starred in two more weekly television series, &quot;Jessie&quot; (1984) and &quot;A Peaceable Kingdom&quot; (1989), though both were cancelled with neither completing their first season. In 1983, she also appeared in an episode of Lee Majors&#x27; series &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;.

Wagner continued to act into the 1990s and 2000s, though in less prominent roles, such as a small part in the action movie &quot;Ricochet&quot; (1991). Her most recent projects have included the 2005 television film &quot;Thicker than Water&quot; with Melissa Gilbert, &quot;Buckaroo: The Movie&quot; (2005), and &quot;Four Extraordinary Women&quot; (2006). In 2010, Wagner began a recurring role as Dr. Vanessa Calder in the SyFy channel&#x27;s hit drama &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; and played the character again in its Syfy sister show &quot;Alphas&quot; in 2011. In the fall semester of 2013, Wagner began teaching at San Bernardino Valley College in southern California (Acting and Directing for Television and Film, Motion Picture Production) as an adjunct faculty member. In 2015, Wagner appeared in the &quot;NCIS&quot; season 13, episode 10: &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; in the role of Barbara Bishop, the mother of &quot;NCIS&quot; Probationary Agent Eleanor Bishop (Emily Wickersham).

She appeared in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as Alex Karev&#x27;s mother, Helen Karev, over the course of two seasons, first appearing in 2018 during Season 14 for a single episode and reappearing in 2019 for a number of episodes during Season 15.

In June 2018, it was announced that Wagner would co-star in &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, a video game being developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and Kojima Productions. Wagner lent her likeness to the characters Bridget and Amelie Strand and voiced the former, with Emily O&#x27;Brien voicing the latter and a younger version of the former. &quot;Death Stranding&quot; was Wagner&#x27;s first role in a video game, and her first experience with the industry&#x27;s motion capture and voice acting technology.

In 2021, Wagner starred in the holiday romance film &quot;Christmas at the Ranch&quot; with Amanda Righetti, Laur Allen, Archie Kao and Dia Frampton playing the character Meemaw.

===Other work===

In 1987, Wagner wrote a series of books with Robert M. Klein about using acupressure to achieve results akin to a surgical facelift. In 1994, she co-authored the vegetarian cookbook, &quot;High Road to Health&quot;.

Wagner appeared in commercials as a spokesperson for Southern California&#x27;s regional Ford Motor Company dealerships from 1987 through 2000. She was also a spokesperson in infomercials for Select Comfort&#x27;s &quot;Sleep Number&quot; bed from 2003 to 2009.

In recent years, Wagner has given seminars and workshops for her self-help therapy, &quot;Quiet the Mind and Open the Heart,&quot; which promotes spirituality and meditation.

In 2010, she participated in interviews and featurettes included in the long-delayed North American DVD releases of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; and the 2011 release of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man.&quot;

In 2016, Wagner publicly advocated as a treatment for her chronic urticaria (i.e., hives) Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS), a substance which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared was a toxic industrial bleach used in wastewater treatment and hydraulic fracturing.

===Honors===
Wagner earned an Emmy Award in 1977 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Dramatic Role for her role in &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; television series.

On December 13, 1984, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce presented Wagner with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, category &#x27;Film&#x27;, located at the north side of the 6700 block of Hollywood Boulevard.

In 2012, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to Wagner.

On October 18, 2019, the San Diego International Film Festival presented the actress with the Humanitarian Award. Previous winners include, Geena Davis, Mariel Hemingway and Joaquin Phoenix.

==Personal life==
During the first year of &quot;The Bionic Woman,&quot; Wagner was the driver in a car accident with her then boyfriend, actor Michael Brandon, in the passenger seat. Brandon almost lost an eye and Wagner received a severe cut on her upper lip which left a small but permanent scar. The event halted production on the show for weeks.

Prior to her first marriage, Wagner lived with Captain Daniel M. Yoder (USAF) until he went to Vietnam. She has been married and divorced four times. From 1971 to 1973, she was married to music publisher Allan Rider. From 1976 to 1979, she was married to Michael Brandon. In 1981, she married stuntman Henry Kingi, whom she met on the set of &quot;The Bionic Woman.&quot; Wagner had two sons with Kingi, Dorian (b. 1982) and Alex (b. 1986). The couple divorced in 1984. Wagner married TV producer Lawrence Mortorff in 1990 and they divorced three years later.

Wagner was scheduled to be a passenger on American Airlines Flight 191 from Chicago to Los Angeles on May 25, 1979, but suddenly felt very ill while waiting for the plane. She skipped the flight, which crashed only minutes after takeoff, killing all 271 people on board and 2 people on the ground – the deadliest aviation accident to have occurred in the United States.

In the early 1980s, Wagner owned a home in the Hollywood Hills, next door to Edward Van Halen and Valerie Bertinelli. After Van Halen constructed his 5150 studio behind his own house, Wagner began to complain about the loudness of his band&#x27;s recording their &quot;1984&quot; album. Wagner eventually moved out and Van Halen purchased the house.

<doc id="964645" wikidata="Q1138132" url="?curid=964645" title="The Virgin Queen (TV serial)">
<text>The Virgin Queen is a 2005 BBC and Power co-production, four-part miniseries based upon the life of Queen Elizabeth I, starring Anne-Marie Duff and Tom Hardy as Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. It was nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Serial in 2007.

==Plot==
From her time as a young princess in her early twenties to her death in 1603, &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; explores both the public and private life of Queen Elizabeth I (Anne-Marie Duff). The series focuses on the internal motivation behind 25-year-old Elizabeth&#x27;s vow of chastity upon her ascension to the throne. As a child, she confides in her friend Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (Tom Hardy), that she wishes to never marry. Her relationship with Dudley, who would later become master of the Queen&#x27;s horses, spans the four-part series and calls into question the ambiguous nature of their relations. The series features a scene where a dreaming Elizabeth fantasizes about making love to Dudley. When his wife Amy (Emilia Fox) dies under suspicious circumstances, Dudley proposes to the Queen and is rejected. Upon his death, Elizabeth&#x27;s affections turn to Dudley&#x27;s step-son Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. However, when he is caught making plans for a coup, she has him executed.

As queen, Elizabeth is meticulous in constructing her public image. Scrutinizing every detail, she micro-manages everything from her appearance to her attitude. Alternately chaste and flirtatious, she nevertheless eschews love in favour of England. History and politics are intertwined throughout the series, from England&#x27;s defeat of the Spanish Armada to the change from a Catholic to a Protestant nation, Elizabeth uses her power and her court to maintain her will.

==Production==
Co-Produced by the BBC and Power television for £9 million, The Virgin Queen was filmed at Pinewood Studios in summer 2005. Originally intended to air on BBC One in September 2005, the date would have coincided with the release of the Channel 4 two-part miniseries &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; (starring Helen Mirren). Due to the conflict, the BBC decided to delay the UK release until after the US opening in November 2005 on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;.

Despite being a biopic of Elizabeth&#x27;s life and reign, the series presented its main character with particular interest in several themes, most notably the emotional impact of her mother&#x27;s execution and her love for Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (Tom Hardy). Writer Paula Milne said of the series, &quot;As my research started to reveal her unravelling, tumultuous relationship with Dudley, I knew I had found the spine of the story. Smart political and psychological interpretations of her life might give the drama contemporary gravitas, but its real power would lie in its emotional truth. Losing love, for whatever reason, reaches out through the centuries to all of us who have found love and lost it.&quot;

==Summary==
===Episode 1===
The first episode depicts Elizabeth from her imprisonment in the Tower of London by the Queen, her sister Mary I, accused with plotting the Queen&#x27;s demise, to her accession to the throne following Mary&#x27;s death, and her coronation. Elizabeth was imprisoned in the Tower, accused of participating in Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion to overthrow Mary. The episode strongly hints Elizabeth&#x27;s participation, though evidence of this remains highly conjectural. The episode also establishes Elizabeth&#x27;s relationship with Robert Dudley, and they are shown to be greatly in love, despite Dudley being married to Amy Robsart, whom he met at the Stanfield Hall, they were married when both were 18 years old. Elizabeth&#x27;s frustration at her later house arrest at Woodstock Manor is emphasised to somewhat comic effect. She is shown being held at Woodstock from her release from the Tower until her sister&#x27;s death from cancer, when in reality she was only held there a year, before being recalled to London so Mary could keep a closer eye on her. The episode also depicts the legend of Elizabeth being told she is Queen of England under an oak tree, depicted as being in Woodstock but which in reality is claimed to have occurred at Hatfield House, and her utterance of the quote &quot;This is the work of the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes...&quot;

===Episode 2===
The second episode shows Elizabeth from several months to a year after her coronation, establishing herself as Queen, to the emergence of Mary, Queen of Scots, as her political rival. The episode makes much of her clandestine romance with Robert Dudley, and her resistance to marriage. Elizabeth is shown to be struggling with the adjustment to being Queen, especially in regard to Dudley. A scene shows Elizabeth dreaming of making love with Dudley, but the plot of the series follows the opinion that she resisted these urges, and remained a virgin. The episode introduces or further establishes several key characters in the story of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, including William Cecil; Amy Robsart; Francis Walsingham; Katherine Ashley; Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk (Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin); and Lettice Knollys. The episode also shows Robert at his house with his wife, Amy, her health is in a poor condition, asking her husband to stay with her, but Robert replies that he must attend the court. also, the episode depicts Elizabeth&#x27;s courtship from Philip II of Spain (her sister&#x27;s widower) and the Archduke Charles of Austria. It also shows Elizabeth&#x27;s early dealings with her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, including her plans for her to marry Dudley, as a means to secure a political union between England and Scotland, and the treason of Thomas Howard. The closing scene depicts the start of the relationship between Robert Dudley and Lettice Knollys. Midway through the episode, Elizabeth&#x27;s contraction of smallpox is dramatically depicted, the death of Dudley&#x27;s wife, Amy Robsart, who waited and longed for Robert, the episode shows her taking her own life, to help achieving her husband&#x27;s ambitions to marry Elizabeth.

===Episode 3===
The third episode begins with Elizabeth&#x27;s courtship with Francis, Duke of Anjou, and ends just following the destruction of the Spanish Armada. During her near death from smallpox in the previous episode, Elizabeth is shown wearing the ornate red wig or hairpiece she has become famous for. The episode depicts Elizabeth&#x27;s courtship of Anjou as nothing more than politics, and a wish for an heir, and suggests that she harboured little real affection for him, though like many of her courtships, this remains ambiguous. The key point of character drama in this episode is Elizabeth&#x27;s discovery of Robert Dudley&#x27;s marriage to Lettice Knollys, in that scene, Dudley echoed the phraseology from his dead wife, Amy&#x27;s earlier letter, he says, &quot;I mortgaged my life in the hope that someday we&#x27;d be together. I have stood by and watched while others fall at your feet. flattering you vanity.&quot; upon which she is shown flying into a grief-fuelled rage. The illness Dudley suffered prior to his death is also depicted from fairly early on, though Elizabeth remains ignorant of his affliction. Great focus is also placed on Elizabeth&#x27;s turmoil over the situation with Mary, Queen of Scots, who is executed towards the end of the episode, an act which Elizabeth is shown expressing great remorse in private. The impending invasion of the Spanish Armada is dealt with fairly rapidly, the primary scene concerning the Armada being Elizabeth&#x27;s encampment at Tilbury, where she gives an invigorating speech. These scenes are intercut, and immediately followed with her grief and heartbreak over the death of Robert Dudley, and her brief seclusion during the celebrations over the Armada&#x27;s defeat. The episode ends with her first encounter with Robert Devereux. The ending makes much of the theory that Devereux was actually the son of Robert Dudley by Lettice Knollys, instead of the result of her first marriage to Walter Devereux.

===Episode 4===
This episode shows Elizabeth in the twilight of her reign. Anne Marie Duff and Sienna Guillory are given ageing makeup in this episode, accentuating their age in comparison to the previous episodes, marking them as enduring &#x27;relics&#x27; of the past. The episode revolves mainly around Elizabeth&#x27;s relationship with Robert Devereux as her court favourite, and the machinations for his advancement by his mother Lettice Knollys, the Queen&#x27;s former handmaiden. The enmity between Elizabeth and Lettice is also emphasised, and the plot deviates from established history by showing that Elizabeth eventually did meet with Lettice before her death, albeit briefly and without exchanging words. Devereux is held as a pawn between the two women, his love for Elizabeth on one side, his devotion to his mother on the other, the pressure of which causes him great turmoil, bordering on mental instability, culminating in his attempt at rebellion towards the end of the episode.
One haunting scene in the episode shows Devereux walking in on a half-dressed Elizabeth, and his shock when he sees the Queen as decrepit and old, without her wig or make up. Elizabeth is the one remaining relic of the England she once knew, most of her friends and trusted advisors having been replaced by the next generation. The emphasis on Devereux takes away somewhat from the political problems Elizabeth was facing at the time, such as with Spain, France and Ireland, as well as significant problems in England itself with high taxes and the failure of the crops, though these events are made frequent reference to. The episode concludes with Robert Devereux&#x27;s execution and Elizabeth&#x27;s demise, including her encroaching senility and dementia with age, and her depression over Devereux&#x27;s death. In these scenes, she is shown delivering her famous Golden Speech to Parliament. Her death is depicted in a more dramatic fashion than in reality, with her refusing to lie down in fear that she would not stand again. Elizabeth is also reminiscing of her life; walking through a crowd of people when her father was on the throne with someone saying &quot;bastard&quot;, being informed that her sister Mary is dead, her beloved friend and chief-lady of the bedchamber Kat Ashley smiling at her, William Cecil, her one true love Robert Dudley smiling at her and her fateful exclamation of &quot;I will have one mistress here, and no master! Do you hear me?!&quot;
Finally, she is drawn from her reminiscing when she apparently suffers a stroke and collapses, with her advisers, courtiers and ladies-in-waiting rushing to assist as she dies. The episode ends with William Cecil&#x27;s son, Robert, preparing for the accession of Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, James I. He is seen discovering that Elizabeth added a clasp to the ring worn by the sovereign; opening it, he discovers that a portrait has been hidden. The episode ends with Robert speaking &quot;It is the whore Anne Boleyn; her mother.&quot;

<doc id="964648" wikidata="Q3708759" url="?curid=964648" title="Beavercreek, Oregon">
<text>Beavercreek is an unincorporated hamlet and census-designated place in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States, located southeast of Oregon City. The population was 4,485 at the 2010 census.

==Demographics==
==History==
According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, the name &quot;Beaver Creek&quot; was first used for a school district in this area in the early 1850s. It was named for the creek that flows through the community and into the Willamette River. A post office operated under various names in the locality until 1922, when the name was changed to Beavercreek, the form still used today. Beavercreek&#x27;s ZIP code is 97004.

In the summer of 2006, the citizens of Beavercreek voted to become Oregon&#x27;s first hamlet, a system of quasi-government which exists in Clackamas County, Oregon. A final hearing by the board of county commissioners on the formation of the hamlet took place in September 2006, and officially recognized the community as The Hamlet of Beavercreek. The hamlet holds monthly community meetings at the Beavercreek Grange hall, except for quarterly town hall meetings, which may be held at other locations to accommodate attendance.

==Education==
The community is served by the Oregon City School District, Canby School District, Colton School District, and Molalla River School District. Beavercreek Elementary School is located in the Hamlet.

==Points of interest==

===Miller House===
Just after 1900, the Miller family built a farm house on the corner of what is now Ridge Road and Lower Highland Road. The home was moved to keep it from being destroyed and is being restored by current Beavercreek residents Rick and Kassandra Young. The Miller House was the childhood home of Ava Helen Miller, who married Linus Pauling, the only person to be awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes (for chemistry in 1954 and for peace in 1962).

===Geocaching===
Beavercreek is the birthplace of geocaching. The first documented placement of a GPS-located cache took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer of Beavercreek a few miles west of the community.

==Notable residents==
* Tonya Harding, figure skater
* Ava Helen Pauling (Miller), human rights activist, wife of Linus Pauling

<doc id="964649" wikidata="Q497107" url="?curid=964649" title="Mstislav III of Kiev">
<text>Mstislav Romanovich the Old (died 1223) was Prince of Pskov (1179–?), Smolensk (1197–?), Belgorod (1206), Halych (?–?) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1212–1223). He was the son of Roman Rostislavich.

==Reign==
Mstislav defeated an invading Hungarian army in 1221. In April 1223, the Mongols of Genghis Khan sent an envoy of ten ambassadors to negotiate a surrender or alliance. The Rus&#x27; haughtily executed them all. The Mongol commanders Subutai and Jebe defeated and captured him three days after the Battle of the Kalka River at a palisade on a nearby hill. According to the Novgorod Chronicle, of the large Kievan Rus&#x27; army sent out to fight the Mongols, only &quot;every tenth returned to his home.&quot; For the first time since the attack of the Huns on Europe over seven centuries earlier, an Asian force had invaded Europe and utterly annihilated a major army.

An account of Mstislav&#x27;s execution after the battle is described in Jack Weatherford&#x27;s historical book &quot;Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World&quot;:

At the end of the campaign, Subutai and Jebe led their soldiers down to spend a relaxing spring in the Crimea on the Black Sea. They celebrated their victory with a great drunken party that lasted for days. The guest of honor was the defeated Prince Mstislav and his two sons-in-law, but their treatment showed how much the Mongols had changed since the time of Genghis Khan. The Mongols wrapped the three of them in felt rugs, as befitted high-ranking aristocrats, and stuffed them beneath the floorboards of their ger, thereby slowly, but bloodlessly, crushing the men as the Mongols drank and sang through the night on the floor above them. It was important to the Mongols that the Russians understand the severe penalty for killing ambassadors, and it was equally as important for the Mongol leaders to reaffirm to their own men the extent to which they would always be willing to go to avenge the unjust killing of a Mongol.

<text>The F engine family from Mazda is a mid-sized inline-four piston engine with iron block, alloy head and belt-driven SOHC and DOHC configurations. Introduced in 1983 as the 1.6-litre F6, this engine was found in the Mazda B-Series truck and Mazda G platform models such as Mazda 626/Capella as well as many other models internationally including Mazda Bongo and Ford Freda clone, Mazda B-series based Ford Courier, Mazda 929 HC and the GD platform-based Ford Probe

There were four basic head types within the F range, the diesel SOHC 8-valve (R-series), the petrol SOHC 8-valve, petrol SOHC 12-valve, and the petrol DOHC 16-valve. These heads came attached to multiple variations of the different blocks and strokes. Only the petrol 8-valve and 12-valve shared the same gasket pattern. It was built at the Miyoshi Plant in Miyoshi, Hiroshima, Japan.

==Predecessors (VC/MA/F) ==
These engines are only the predecessors to the F-series engines, in no other way related. They were fitted to rear-wheel drive models in a longitudinal arrangement. This is in contrast to the successor engines that were designed for transverse front-wheel drive applications as had become the trend in the late-1970s and early-1980s.

===VC===
The VC is a overhead camshaft inline-four, with a bore and a stroke of . It was all new in 1975 (pre-1975 1.8 Couriers got the earlier, long-stroke VB engine) and has an alloy eight-valve head on an iron block. Output varied considerably depending on market and installation, in a 1981 UK-market B1800 it is DIN at 5000 rpm and at 2500 rpm.

Applications:
* 1975–1978 Mazda Luce / 929
* 1975–1977 Mazda Cosmo / 121
* 1977–1981 Mazda Luce / 929
* 1977–1984 Mazda B1800/Proceed PE2V
* 1978–1982 Mazda Capella/626
* 1975–1978 Ford Courier
* 1978–1983 Mazda Bongo
* 1974-1977 Mazda Parkway

===MA/F===
The was designated MA. Bore was as for the VC, , but stroke was increased to . This SOHC engine with a 2–barrel carburettor produced and . A more fuel-efficient 1–barrel version produced . Later on, this engine was designated the F.

Applications:
* 1981–1982 Mazda Luce/Mazda Cosmo
* 1975–1980 Mazda Luce/929
* 1979–1988 Mazda 929 Wagon
* 1979–1982 Mazda Capella/626
* 1977–1985 Mazda B2000 (Officially, there was no 1985 year model for the B-Series in the USA. They skipped to 1986 for this line of vehicles for that market.)
* 1977–1985 Ford Courier (The Ford Courier was canceled in the US in 1982 to make room for the Ford Ranger the following year.)

==F6==
The smallest of the F-family engines is the F6 8-valve SOHC engine. Essentially a de-bored and de-stroked version of the base FE 2.0 with a bore and stroke of . At a compression ratio of 8.6:1, output is at 5500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. It replaced the F/NA 1.6 from the previous generation.

Applications:
* 1983–1987 Mazda Capella/626
* 1983–1985 Mazda B1600

==F8==
A destroked FE at , the F8 comes in several configurations including a 12-valve head and fuel injection later in its life. It has a very high rod/stroke ratio of 2:1, bore and a stroke of . With a compression ratio of 8.6:1, power output is at 5500 rpm and at 2500 for the 8-valve SOHC carburetted versions.

Applications:
* 1983–1991 Mazda Capella/626
* 1988-1992 Mazda Persona/Eunos 300
* 1984-2005 Mazda Bongo/Ford Econovan
* 1989-1994 Kia Capital
* 1988-1991 Kia Concord
* 1993-1999 Asia Rocsta

==F8-DOHC==

The F8-DOHC is a DOHC F8 and basically a de-stroked version of the FE-DOHC displacing . It uses the same exhaust cam, but a different intake cam with less lift and a long, single-runner intake manifold. The F8 is usually identified by its unpainted cam cover. Output was at 6000 rpm and at 5000 rpm. It is usually found in wagon variants.

Applications:
* 1988–1996 Mazda Capella/626
* 1990-1992 Mazda Persona/Eunos 300

==FE==
The FE has a square bore and stroke. It was available as an 8-valve SOHC and 12-valve SOHC. Outputs are at 5000 rpm and at 2500 rpm for the 8-valve carburetor version, or at 5300 rpm and at 3700 rpm with fuel injection, 12-valve SOHC and a higher compression ratio (10.0:1 vs 8.6:1).

Applications:
* 1983–1991 Mazda Capella/626
* 1982-1987 Ford Telstar
* 1985–1987 Mazda B-Series
* 1985–1999 Mazda E-series
* 1981–1990 Mazda 929
* 1987-1995 Kia Concord

==FET==

The fuel-injected, turbocharged FET version of the FE produced at 5250 rpm and at 2800 rpm. It was a variant of the 8-valve SOHC FE Featuring a small turbocharger and no intercooler producing of boost. As such it features the same bore and stroke of the FE. The Japanese variant of this engine was dubbed the &quot;Magnum Turbo&quot; and produces . Given that the peak power for the naturally aspirated, fuel-injected FE is , the rated power for the FET is said to be conservative.

Applications:
* 1986–1987 Mazda Capella/626
* 1986–1987 Ford Telstar Turbo
* 1986–1987 Mazda 929 coupe

==FE-DOHC==
The FE-DOHC is the 16 valve DOHC variant of the FE. The official Mazda engine codes of newer iterations are FE-DE and FE-ZE, depending on output level. Commonly called the FE3 which is also stamped into its head castings. The FE-DOHC shares the same dimensions as the original FE-SOHC, including the square bore x stroke and it has a 1.74 rod/stroke ratio. The FE-DOHC is usually identified by a gold-coloured cam cover, however not always. There were at least five different FE-DOHC engines available with various compression ratio, camshaft and ECU tuning combinations, however none were fitted with a turbocharger from the factory. In European 10.0:1 compression, non-catalytic trim, the FE-DOHC produces 148 ps (108 kW) at 6000 rpm and 133 lb/ft (182 Nm) at 4000 rpm. The 9.2:1 compression, catalytic converter version produces 140 ps. The Japanese domestic market variants produce anywhere between 145 ps and 165 ps. The only vehicle with 165ps was the 96-97 Capellas Wagons, FX (MT or AT) or FX Cruising (Only exists in AT). These received different tail lights to the earlier wagons.

The FE-DOHC was a European and Japanese market engine only (excluding use by Kia), and as such was only ever delivered in vehicles by Mazda to countries in those markets, with the exception of New Zealand who also received European market models. The engine was first fitted to the GD model 1988-1992 626 GT, 1987-1991 Capella, and the 626 Coupé GT 2.0i/Capella C2 GT-X and GT-R. In South Africa, Samcor – who built Mazdas under licence – also fitted the FE-DOHC engine to the Mazda 323 from 1991 to 1994.

Alongside the sedan, hatch and coupé models the FE-DOHC was also being used in the GV wagon, which ran until 1997. The rest of the world mainly received the FE-DOHC in the 1995–2003 Kia Sportage, built by Kia under license. Kia first introduced the engine in March 1992, when they installed it in the Kia Concord, a license built version of the 1982 Mazda Capella. The Sportage variant was reconfigured for rear-wheel drive configuration with long single-runner intake manifold, low-duration cams and exclusively in the low compression ratio of 9.2:1.

Applications:
* 1988–1997 Mazda Capella/626
* 1991–1993 323 200i (South Africa)
* 1992–1993 Ford Laser 2.0iRS and Meteor 2.0 16v (South Africa)
* 1995–2003 Kia Sportage
* 1992-1995 Kia Concord

;Capella Cargo variants
===Design===
The Mazda FE-DOHC uses a wide-angle, DOHC, belt-driven valvetrain configuration with flat-tappet 33 mm HLA bucket lifters. It is a non interference design. There are two valve springs per valve and four valves per cylinder. While a dual valve spring configuration is used, the stock springs are fairly low-sprung. Low spring rates were chosen for fuel efficiency and increased valvetrain longevity, and low friction with the dual valve springs for the reduction of harmonics and increased valve stability.

The head gasket used on the Kia version can be sourced in North America, but the builder must note that the coolant passage holes are configured for a RWD cooling system. Attempting to use the RWD head gasket in FWD cooling configuration will result in improper flow and can result in overheating of cylinder #4. Like many DOHC engines, this engine has an interference valvetrain design, making periodic timing belt changes vital to the engine&#x27;s life. Should the timing belt break the engine should be replaced as piston and valvetrain damage will occur.

The Mazda FE-DOHC came with several different camshaft profiles from the factory. As such there were several camshaft combinations available.

The F8K1 was the intake camshaft for the F8-DOHC, only listed due to family ties.

The combinations available:
====VICS====
The FE-DOHC featured Mazda&#x27;s VICS system, short for Variable Inertia Control System, a variable intake setup to optimize runner length and resonance at different engine speeds. Much like Toyota&#x27;s Acoustic Control Induction System, it had two sets of intake runners, a long set for low-medium RPMs, and a short set for high RPMs. It was operated by a vacuum solenoid based on the engine&#x27;s current speed, actuating a pair of butterflies inside the manifold to open or close the short runners past 5400 RPM. This system has been used on many Mazda engines since including the BP. The K-series V6 engines used a different principle to the same effect dubbed VRIS. Two versions of the VICS intake system exist, one has steeper straighter runners than the other, which is kinked for vehicle packaging reasons. VICS was not present on the F8-DOHC or some of Kia version of the FE-DOHC, both of which use a conventional intake manifold design.

==F2==

The F2 is a stroked version of the FE with a bore and stroke of , for a displacement of . Introduced for the 1988–1992 GD platform cars, it can also be found in the B2200 pickup and Ford Probe. A high-output variant of the F2 coded F2H2 was used in RWD configuration in the Mazda 929. The compression ratio was raised to 9.2:1 and produced /. Although available as an 8-valve SOHC in the B2200, this engine is most commonly a 12-valve SOHC. With an 8.6:1 compression ratio, it generates at 4700 rpm and .

Applications:
* 1986–1991 Mazda 929
* 1988–1992 Mazda 626
* 1988–1992 Mazda MX-6
* 1989–1992 Ford Probe
* 1987–1999 Mazda B2200

==F2T==

The F2T is a turbocharged version of the F2 equipped with an IHI-supplied RHB5 VJ11 turbocharger and an air-to-air intercooler. Internally the engine retains its bore and stroke of , but has a lower compression ratio of 7.8:1. It produces at 4300 rpm and . It is rumored that this figure was produced at the drive wheels, as this engine was suspected to be under-rated. However Mazda had only ever quoted these figures as SAE Net and DIN which are crankshaft rating standards, as required by law in the countries where the cars were sold. Due to the increased torque output, Mazda was forced to increase the strength of the transmission for the F2T, producing the H-type, the strongest FWD gearbox Mazda produced at the time.

Applications:
* Mazda 626 GT
* Mazda MX-6 GT
* Ford Probe GT
* Ford Telstar TX5 Turbo

==R-series==
The R-series engines are diesel variants that are very closely related to the F-series, sharing essentially the same engine block.

==Later engines with &#x27;F&#x27; nomenclature==

The FS and FP are structurally different from the original F-blocks with much smaller bore spacing, much shorter deck height and smaller head and journal dimensions. The FS and FP are more closely related to the Mazda BP engine than they are with the original F-engine.

===FS===

The FS has a bore and stroke of and produces and in its most common variant up to in the Japanese domestic market. In 1998 the engine evolved into the FS-DE by undergoing several changes, most notably a distributorless ignition as well as the move from hydraulic lifters to solid shim-on-bucket lifters. Japan received a couple of variations of the FS motor, all with increased power outputs. The highest is the Mazdaspeed Familia version of the FS-ZE which produces . Mazdaspeed US decided to turbocharge the US FS-DE, known as the FS-DET in 2003, for the Mazdaspeed Protegé. This model generates , practically the same as the naturally aspirated Mazdaspeed Familia edition FS-ZE but with a plumper torque curve. This means that the Mazdaspeed Protegé&#x27;s engine is internally identical to the regular FS-DE, except with a turbocharger installed.

The updated FS-DE engine did enjoy a few minor technical features, such as:
* Oil Squirters
* VICS (Variable Inertial Charge System) - A system that can vary the volume of the intake manifold resulting in a broader power band. There were known issues with this system, the most noteworthy was a defect which allowed screws that secured the VICS butterfly valves to come loose and end up being sucked into the engine. Some engines had to be replaced entirely due to the extent of the damage caused.
* VTCS (Variable Tumble Control System) - A set of butterflies in the intake manifold that would close to promote low emissions combustion under cold start at low engine speeds. These had a reputation of being noisy at times.
* Windage Tray

Applications:
* 1993–2002 Mazda 626
* 1993–1997 Mazda MX-6
* 1999–2001 Mazda MPV (Japan)
* 1999–2003 Mazda Capella
* 2001–2003 Mazda Protegé
* 1993–1997 Ford Probe
* 1993–1999 Ford Telstar

===FP===

The FP is a destroked version of the FS, with a bore and stroke of . It produces and . This engine is often incorrectly called the F8, which is the earlier destroked engine based on the FE. The FP enjoys a much better power band vs the FS due to slightly different camshafts and a better rod ratio over the regular FS-DE.

The FP is very close to the FS in many ways and shares a large percentage of parts but has its own FP specific block, crank, rods, pistons and timing belt. The pistons for the FS produce a compression ratio of 9.1:1 (USDM) but when FP pistons are used in the FS they yield 9.7:1 compression ratio. The biggest performance difference is that the European 1.8L FP &amp; 2.0L FS both have maximum compression of vs the North American 2.0L FS which has a maximum compression of . The KL &amp; FS ATX engines both require 10° BTDC ignition timing while the FS MTX &amp; FP require 12° BTDC. The FP does not share the same G25M-R transmission as the FS. In the Protegé it uses a F25M-R instead.

Applications:
* 1992–1993 Eunos 500
* 1997–2001 Mazda Capella/Mazda 626 
* 1999–2000 Mazda Protegé (ES models only)
* 1998-2003 Mazda 323 Astina &amp; Protege (Australia)
* 1998-2002 Ford Laser
* 1999-2004 Mazda Premacy

<text>Avenue D is the easternmost named avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, east of Avenue C and west of the FDR Drive. It runs through East 13th and Houston Streets, and continues south of Houston Street as Columbia Street until Delancey Street and [[Abraham E. Kazan]] Street until its end at Grand Street. Avenues A, B, C and D are the origin of the name of the section of the East Village neighborhood through which they run, Alphabet City.

==History==
The street was created by the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, as one of 16 north–south streets specified as in width; they include 12 numbered avenues, and four (located east of First Avenue) designated by letter.

==Transportation==
The M14D SBS bus travels Avenue D East 10th Street to Houston Street then (then south along Columbia Street) to Delancey Street at the Baruch Houses. The M8 routes also travel on the avenue for short stretches. 

==Structures==
Among the structures along this avenue are:

* Dry Dock Park, located at the northern end (11th and Avenue D), a small park with a public pool—named for the neighborhood&#x27;s former tradition of ship repair. The corner was formerly the site of the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Co.
* Many of the larger Public Housing projects in Alphabet City are on Avenue D. The east side of Avenue D is flanked by the Jacob Riis Houses (NYCHA housing), named for photographer Jacob Riis, who chronicled the plight of the city&#x27;s poorest residents. The development was designed by Walker &amp; Gillette and was completed in 1949. Other projects include Baruch Houses, LaGuardia Houses, and the Lillian Wald Houses, named for Lillian D. Wald (1867–1940), who provided aid to the Lower East Side through the Henry Street Settlement and the Visiting Nurses Society.
* Between 5th and 6th Streets, east of Avenue D, was formerly the location of the &quot;Boys Brotherhood Republic&quot;, a self-governing youth project of the Henry Street Settlement.

<doc id="964652" wikidata="Q7826322" url="?curid=964652" title="Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry">
<text>The Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into allegations of conflict of interest, bribery and misappropriation of funds around computer leasing contracts entered into by the City of Toronto government in 1998 and 1999. It was held concurrently with the Toronto External Contracts Inquiry.

==Background==
On January 1, 1998, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and its six lower-tier cities (Toronto, Scarborough, North York, Etobicoke, East York and York) were amalgamated into the single &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto. In one of the new city&#x27;s first official acts of business, computer equipment was leased for city councillors&#x27; offices from MFP Financial Services, at a value of $1,093,731. City staff have not been able to produce any documentation to prove that this contract was awarded through proper procedures.

In May, 1999, the city issued a Request For Quotations for its new computer acquisition needs. MFP was one of the bidders, and was awarded the contract in July of that year. MFP was contracted to provide $43 million of computer equipment to the city on a three-year lease agreement. However, the final lease agreement was not signed until after the 90-day price guarantee had expired.

That fall, the city sold its &quot;owned&quot; computer equipment to MFP, and then leased it back as well.

Over the duration of the agreement, the city paid $85 million to MFP, rather than the original $43 million approved by city council. As well, many of the equipment schedules were for five-year leases rather than three. Some of these leases were later restructured to extend the lease terms even further, resulting in additional costs.

In December of that year, the city acquired 10,000 Oracle database licenses, again through an MFP lease. This turned out to be a serious overestimate of the city&#x27;s actual needs.

These issues came to light in late 2001, after an investigation by Toronto city councillors David Miller and Bas Balkissoon. In February, 2002, the Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry was established by city council. The commissioner of the inquiry is Madam Justice Denise Bellamy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

==The Inquiry==
MFP&#x27;s lead salesman on the city contract was Dash Domi, the brother of former Toronto Maple Leafs player Tie Domi. Much of the testimony presented to the inquiry alleged an improper financial relationship between Domi and former city councillor Tom Jakobek, the city&#x27;s budget chief at the time of the contracts.

The inquiry was presented with evidence that Jakobek&#x27;s name, along with other city staff, was on the passenger manifest for a flight, paid for by MFP, to a Leafs game in Philadelphia. For several weeks, witnesses testified that they could not recall whether Jakobek was actually on the flight, but Jakobek eventually admitted that he had been present, and apologized for lying under oath.

Some of Jakobek&#x27;s office staff have testified that Dash Domi was granted special access to Jakobek&#x27;s office, although other staff members have denied this.

The inquiry also investigated possible connections between a $25,000 withdrawal from Domi&#x27;s bank account on November 1, 1999 and $21,000 in payments on Jakobek&#x27;s credit card two days later. Witnesses have testified that Domi called Jakobek and then parked for thirteen minutes in the underground parking garage at Toronto City Hall barely minutes after the bank withdrawal, although Jakobek has testified that he was not at city hall at all that day.

Both Dash and Tie Domi testified that the $25,000 withdrawal was a birthday gift for Tie (whose birthday is on November 1), and Jakobek has testified that the $21,000 payment on his credit card came from his father-in-law, former Metro Toronto councillor Ken Morrish, to cover a family trip to Disney World.

A forensic review of Jakobek&#x27;s financial statements found that only a portion of the money actually came from Morrish, and the remainder in fact came from several family accounts Jakobek controlled, all of which had unexplained patterns of deposits in denominations of $100. This also included $11,000 from Jakobek&#x27;s grandmother, who has a declared income of less than $15,000 per year.

Members of Jakobek&#x27;s family testified that the money they deposited in his bank accounts was connected to a real estate investment Jakobek and his brother Joseph made in the 1990s. Due to Joe Jakobek&#x27;s financial circumstances, the money was being repaid to Tom Jakobek through an arrangement in which the brothers&#x27; parents made regular payments to Tom and were subsequently reimbursed by Joe whenever he could afford it. They have also testified that family members, including the grandmother, regularly kept unusually large amounts of money in their homes due to their mistrust of banks.

Ontario Provincial Police launched an investigation in 2005 at the request of the City of Toronto. The OPP decided there are no reasonable grounds to lay any criminal charges.

==Follow-up==
On October 1, 2002, an additional inquiry was authorized to investigate a related matters regarding other city consulting contracts. The Toronto External Contracts Inquiry convened on October 18, 2004, after the Computer Leasing Inquiry ended.

==Final Report==
Justice Bellamy released her final report on September 12, 2005. She found that the testimony of Jakobek and Domi was not convincing. She made 241 specific recommendations, which included the following:

* The city should set out its own code of conduct for lobbyists and identify mandatory minimum standards.
* The city should have a gift registry for items received by staff and councillors and the information should be available on a searchable database.
* City staff who leave the public service should not be permitted to become lobbyists for the city for at least 12 months after they leave.
* Politicians who leave office should not be allowed to lobby on matters they worked on.
* The city should expand its current code of conduct for councillors and its conflict of interest policy for staff to include broader ethical considerations.
* Establish a full-time integrity commissioner.
* City staff should have more latitude to speak at council meetings.
* The mayor should report to the public annually on the city&#x27;s budget, audited financial statements and major contracts or tenders awarded.

In a press conference the same afternoon, Miller (who was later elected the city&#x27;s mayor) welcomed the findings, and indicated that he would refer the matter to the Ontario Provincial Police for further investigation.

In response to a recommendation that the mayor report one year after the Inquiry&#x27;s final report on the progress the City is making, Miller submitted a progress report in September 2006.

==No Criminal Charges==

On March 15, 2010, the Ontario Provincial Police announced that no criminal charges would be laid over the computer leasing scandal.

<text>The international border states are those states in the U.S. that border either the Bahamas, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, or Russia. With a total of eighteen of such states, thirteen (including Alaska) lie on the U.S.–Canada border, four lie on the U.S.–Mexico border, and one has maritime borders with Cuba and The Bahamas.

== Border with Canada ==
Thirteen states lie on the U.S.–Canada border. The U.S. states of Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin do not share a direct geographic border with Canada. They do, however, possess customs facilities because they border the Great Lakes, on which international commerce comes from Canada. (All three states border Lake Michigan, while Wisconsin also borders Lake Superior.)

== Border with Mexico ==
Four states lie on the U.S.–Mexico border.

== Borders with other countries ==
In addition to the states bordering on Canada and Mexico, the U.S. state of Florida shares maritime boundaries with Cuba and the Bahamas, and Alaska shares a water boundary with Russia (in addition to its land border with Canada).

<text>Jim Davis (born Marlin Davis; August 26, 1909 – April 26, 1981) was an American actor, best known for his roles in television Westerns. In his later career, he became famous as Jock Ewing in the CBS primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;, a role he continued until he was too ill from multiple myeloma to perform.

==Life and career==
Born in Edgerton in Platte County in northwestern Missouri, Davis attended high school in Dearborn, and the Baptist-affiliated William Jewell College in Liberty. At WJC, he played tight end on the football team and graduated with a degree in political science. He served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II.

He was known as Jim Davis by the time of his first major screen role, which was opposite Bette Davis in the 1948 melodrama &quot;Winter Meeting&quot;. His subsequent film career consisted of mostly B movies, many of them Westerns, although he made an impression as a U.S. Senator in the Warren Beatty conspiracy thriller &quot;The Parallax View&quot;. 

Davis appeared 13 times on &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. In 1954–1955, Davis starred and narrated &quot;Stories of the Century&quot;. He portrayed Matt Clark, a detective for the Southwest Railroad. In 1957 he played an outlaw with scruples in the 16th episode of &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, entitled &quot;Two Cartridges&quot;, with Dale Robertson.

From 1958–1960, Davis starred as Wes Cameron opposite Lang Jeffries in the role of Skip Johnson in the syndicated adventure series &quot;Rescue 8&quot;. About this time, he guest-starred on the syndicated crime drama, &quot;U.S. Marshal&quot;, starring John Bromfield.

Davis made two guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, as George Tabor in the season-six episode of &quot;The Case of the Fickle Filly&quot;, and as murder victim Joe Farrell in the 1964, season-eight episode of &quot;The Case of a Place Called Midnight&quot;. He also appeared on the Jack Lord adventure series, &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;. In 1964, Davis played Wyatt Earp in the episode &quot;After the OK Corral&quot; on &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;; William Tannen played the part of rancher and gunfighter Ike Clanton in the same episode.

Davis appeared eleven times on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and four times each on &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, and &quot;Laramie&quot;. In the next-to-the-last &quot;Laramie&quot; episode, entitled &quot;Trapped&quot; (May 14, 1963), he guest-starred with Tommy Sands, Claude Akins, and Mona Freeman. In the story line, Slim Sherman (John Smith) finds an injured female kidnap victim in the woods (Freeman). Dennis Holmes, as series-regular Mike Williams, rides away to seek help, but the kidnappers reclaim the hostage. Slim pursues the kidnappers, but is mistaken as a third kidnapper by the girl&#x27;s father (Barton MacLane). Sands plays the girl&#x27;s boyfriend, who had been ordered by her father to stop seeing her. Davis also appeared in an episode of &quot;The High Chaparral&quot; and in small roles in the 1971 John Wayne vehicles &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; (1970) and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971). 
In 1974, he starred as Marshal Bill Winter in a short-lived ABC Western series &quot;The Cowboys&quot;, based on a 1972 film of the same name starring John Wayne.

===&quot;Dallas&quot; and last years===
After years of relatively low-profile roles, Davis was cast as family patriarch Jock Ewing on &quot;Dallas&quot;, which debuted in 1978.

The decision had already been made prior to Davis&#x27; death not to recast the character with another actor. Furthermore, after he died the producers strongly considered leaving his name and photos in the opening credits for the duration of the series.

The fifth-season episode &quot;The Search&quot;, which confirmed the character&#x27;s death in a helicopter crash on his way home to Dallas from South America, was broadcast on January 8, 1982, and contained flashback scenes of the character as well as a dedication to him prior to the closing credits. 

== Personal life ==

In 1949, after two short failed marriages, he met Blanche Hammerer at the club &quot;Mocambo&quot; on the Sunset Strip. They later married and remained together for more than 30 years, until Davis&#x27;s death in 1981.

Their only child, daughter Tara Diane Davis, was killed in an automobile accident at the age of 17. Davis later became close to his &quot;Dallas&quot; co-star Victoria Principal, who had a physical resemblance to his late daughter.

==Death==
Davis died at his home in Northridge, California, on April 26, 1981, aged 71. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

== Recognition ==
In February 1960, having already appeared as a guest star on 50 episodes across 20 different television series and having been the series lead of both &quot;Stories of the Century&quot; and &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, Davis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6290 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood, California.

<doc id="964669" wikidata="Q324491" url="?curid=964669" title="Ahmed Kuftaro">
<text>Ahmed Kuftaro (Arabic: أحمد كفتارو; December 1915 – 1 September 2004) was the Grand Mufti of Syria, the highest officially appointed Sunni Muslim representative of the Fatwa-Administration in the Syrian Ministry of Auqaf in Syria. Kaftaro was a Sunni Muslim of the Naqshbandi Sufi order.

== Biography ==
The family of Kuftaro is Kurdish who have their origins in the village of Karma in Ömerli District of Mardin Province, Turkey. In 1878, the Kuftaro family moved to Damascus and settled near the Abu al-Nur mosque in the Kurdish quarter. Kuftaro&#x27;s father, Amin Kuftaro, received a traditional education and started working at the Sa&#x27;id Pasha mosque. His first wife was Najiya Sinjabi and he had four sons and two daughters with her: Musa, Taufiq, Ahmad, Ibrahim, Zaynab and Fatima. With his second wife, Is&#x27;af Badir, he had three children, Rabi&#x27;, &#x27;Abd al-Qadir and Rabi&#x27;a.

==Classic education in Damascus==
Kuftaro&#x27;s father insisted that he first receive a classical education in Quran, Tafsir, Hadith and Islamic jurisprudence, namely Shafi&#x27;i Madhhab with Muslim scholars in Damascus.

== Career in the Ifta&#x27; Administration ==
In 1948, Kuftaro worked as a mosque teacher in Quneitra before moving to Damascus in 1950. Two years later, he became Mufti of the Shafi&#x27;i Madhhab in Damascus and a member of the Higher Ifta Council under Colonel Adib al-Shishakli. Kuftaro&#x27;s political instinct aligned him with the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1955. He reportedly supported the Baath Party candidate in the 1955 election for an open seat in parliament.

* 1998–2006 Mazda B2600
* 1989–1996 Mazda MPV

==G5==
The 2.5 L G5 was an evolution of the G6. It produces at 4000 rpm.

Applications:
* 1995 Mazda B2500
* 1996-1999 Mazda MPV

==GY==
The GY is not at all related to the Mazda G-series four-cylinder engines and is listed in this article strictly by engine code association. GY is the Mazda engine code for a Ford Duratec V6 engine which, due to an OEM deal with Ford, was built by Mazda in Japan for limited use in the 1999-2001 Mazda MPV. This Duratec V6 engine was in turn based on the original Mazda KL from 1991. By the late 1990s (during the Mazda/Ford partnership) Ford executives had ordered Mazda to cease development of V6 engines and instead focus on a new range of four-cylinder engines for both companies&#x27; benefit, which would become the MZR/Duratec lineup of inline-four engines. The order to discontinue their own V6 development included the Mazda K engine, leaving Mazda the only option of employing later Ford V6s, which were considerably cheaper to manufacture.

Applications:
* 1999-2001 Mazda MPV (second generation)

<text>The Mazda B-series is a small-sized, iron-block, inline four-cylinder engine with belt-driven SOHC and DOHC valvetrain ranging in displacement from 1.1 to 1.8 litres. It was used in a wide variety of applications, from front-wheel drive economy vehicles to the turbocharged full-time 4WD 323 GTX and rear-wheel drive Miata.

The B-series is a &quot;non-interference&quot; design, meaning that breakage of its timing belt does not result in damage to valves or pistons, because the opening of the valves, the depth of the combustion chamber and (in some variants) the shaping of the piston crown allow sufficient clearance for the open valves in any possible piston position.

==1.1 liters==
===B1===
 B1 - (68.0x78.4 mm) - came only as a SOHC 8-valve. It was available in the 1987-1989 Mazda 121 and later model Kia Sephia in European and Asian markets. A fuel-injected variant was used in select European market 1991-1995 Mazda 121s

==1.3 liters==
===BJ===
The BJ engine (78.0x67.5 mm) was a DOHC 16-valve engine, used only in the Japanese market Ford Festiva GT, GT-X, and GT-A models (1986.10-1993.01, GT-A from March 1991). It generates at 7000 rpm and is equipped with Mazda&#x27;s &quot;EGi&quot; single-point fuel injection. It is a short-stroke version of the B5/B6 engines.

===B6-2E===
 B6-2E - (78.0x83.6 mm), also known as B6-ME - This was a variant of the B6-E with a SOHC, 16-valve cylinder head.

===B6T===
 B6T - (78.0x83.6 mm) - The ubiquitous turbocharged, fuel-injected and intercooled 16-valve DOHC B6, released in 1985 and used in numerous models worldwide including the 1985-1989 Mazda Familia BFMR/BFMP (turbo), 1985-1989 Ford Laser TX3 turbo, and 1991-1994 Mercury Capri XR2. This engine was most commonly found mated to a 4WD drivetrain although FWD models were also available.

Power and torque outputs varied across markets due to emission and fuel standards. The B6T available in North America came with and . The Japanese version was slightly more powerful, producing and due to better intake manifold design and its ability to run 100 octane fuel. For the special rally homologation BFMR Familia GT-Ae model released in 1987, power and torque were raised to and respectively through the use of a slightly different turbocharger; engine internals remained otherwise identical.

===B6D===

 B6D - (78.0x83.6 mm) - The same strengthened and fuel-injected 16-valve DOHC B6 but with higher compression, no turbo, and the first Mazda engine to feature Variable Inertia Charge System (VICS). Most commonly found in the 1985-1988 Japanese market Familias, Études and Lasers, this engine was updated in 1989 with revised compression, heads and intake system (in a similar vein to the B5 DOHC) for the 1989-1991 Familia and Laser, then further refined for the 1991-1994 Mercury Capri and 1994 to 1996, second Generation Mazda MX-3 RS. The third-generation B6D features an alloy cam cover, a VLIM (VICS) intake, had a 9:1 compression ratio and produced 107 hp (79 kW).

The engine uses a DOHC 16-valve alloy head with a lightened crankshaft and flywheel to allow a 7,200 rpm redline. An aluminum sump with cooling fins is an unusual feature of this engine. The US and European version (1990-1993) had a 9.4:1 compression ratio and produced at 6,500 rpm, and of torque at 5,500 rpm. The later European version (1994-1997) produced at 6,500 rpm, and at 5,500 rpm. It was then updated to at 6,500 rpm and at 5,000 rpm for the models from 1998 to 2005. The Japanese version of the engine also had a 9.4:1 compression ratio and produced at 6,500 and at 5,500. After 1998 the power was increased to at 6,500 and at 5,000.

===B8===
The B8 (sometimes &quot;BP&quot;) is not just a bored and stroked B6. Rather, it uses a new block with widened cylinder spacing. The bore is 83 mm and the stroke is 85 mm. This SOHC engine was used in various Australian Mazda 323s, the American 1990-1994 Mazda Protegé, and in Canadian variants of the 323 hatchback. It came with four valves per cylinder (B8-ME or BP-ME). It features hydraulic lash adjusters, a belt-driven cam, an 8.9:1 compression ratio, a 6,000 rpm redline, and multi-port fuel injection. Power outputs are:

*, 111 lb-ft (U.S./Canadian market)
* at 5,300 rpm, at 4,000 rpm (European markets)

===BP===
The BP, featuring a bore x stroke of , is a DOHC 4 valves per cylinder variant of the B8. This Inline-four engine was called &quot;BP-ZE&quot; by Mazda engineers and featured a forged crankshaft, piston oil squirters, a structural aluminium oil pan with cooling fins, a 7,000 rpm redline, and Variable Inertia Charging System (VICS) which is activated by a control solenoid at high rpm to increase horsepower in the upper rev range. The engine in base form on 91 RON fuel produces at 6,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm. The engine is a favourite for both N/A and turbo motoring enthusiasts for its robust design, materials and construction. This particular variant can be found in the following vehicles:

* 1989-1994 Mazda Familia GT (Japanese Market)
* 1989-1994 Ford Laser TX3 (Australian Market)
* 1994-1998 Ford Laser KJ GLXi (Australian Market)
* 1994-1998 Mazda Artis &quot;LX&quot; VICS jm1 (South America Market)
* 1990-1994 Mazda Protegé &quot;LX&quot; (with VICS)
* 1995-1998 Mazda Protegé &quot;ES&quot; (Australian Market: 1994-1998 &quot;323 Protegé SE&quot;)
* 1990 Mazda Infini
* 1990-1991 and 1993 Mazda Protegé GT (Canadian Market)
* 1990-1993 Mazda 323 (European Market)
* 1991-1996 Ford Escort &quot;GT and LX-E&quot;
* 1991-1996 Mercury Tracer &quot;LTS&quot;
* 1995-1997 Kia Sephia &quot;RS, LS, GS&quot;
* 1994-1998 Mazda Familia (Japanese Market)
* 1994-1998 Mazda Lantis
* 1994-1997 Mazda MX-5/Miata (did not have VICS until 1999)
* 1996-1998 Suzuki Cultus Crescent/Baleno/Esteem
* 1997 Ford Laser Ghia

There is also a non-performance SOHC version that is most easily recognized by its black stamped-steel oil pan. It also features a cast crankshaft, no oil squirters, a plastic oil pickup tube and less aggressive camshafts. It is found in the 1995-1998 Mazda Protege &quot;ES&quot;.

====BPT====

The BPT is a turbocharged and intercooled variant of the BP. It produced at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm in JDM-spec from G7+ CJ26 AH7 crankshaft. 95 octane rated European models only claimed at 5,500 rpm and at 3,000 rpm.

It featured an IHI RHB5 VJ20 turbocharger, sidemount intercooler, 330 cc blacktop injectors (high impedance). The BPT versions of the Familia and Laser were only available in AWD models, and featured a viscous LSD centre and rear differentials.

Applications:
* 1989-1994 Mazda Familia &quot;GT-X&quot; (Japan)
* 1989-1994 Ford Laser &quot;TX3 turbo&quot; (Australia)
* 1989-1994 Mazda 323 
* 1989-1994 Ford Laser &quot;GT-X&quot;

====BPD====
The mazda BPD engine (also commonly referred to as a BP2) was a revamp of the original BP engine (sometimes called BP1 for clarity&#x27;s sake). It featured a larger crank nose, larger piston oil squirters, a main bearing support plate, better flowing inlet and exhaust ports. This was also the base engine for the Mazda Familia GT-R and GT-Ae. It is commonly known as the &#x27;big turbo&#x27; variant as it utilised a much larger IHI RHF6CB water-cooled turbocharger (vj23). The BPD was used as the basis for the engine, with changes such as sodium-filled exhaust valves, larger (and front-mounted) intercooler, larger (440 cc) low impedance fuel injectors and stronger engine internals helping to up the performance of the engine to produce 209 hp (156 kW) and 184 lb·ft (255 N·m). The VICS system of the N/A BP has been removed, as well as the boost cut from the ecu. This engine was designed to power Mazda to a world rally championship win, and was thus used in the limited production Mazda Familia &quot;GT-R&quot; (2,200 built) and &quot;GTAe&quot; (300 built).

====BP-4W====

The 1999 MX-5 uses a modified BP, the BP-4W, which replaces the old hall effect dual Cam Angle Sensor unit mounted at the back of the exhaust cam with two separate Hall Effect units at the front - one on the intake cam gear and one mounted on the oil pump, to the side of the crankshaft pulley. It also has an improved intake system (a better flowing cylinder head because of the angle of the intake ports being changed). There was also a switch from the earlier problematic hydraulic lifters to solid lifters. The engine initially produced 140 hp at 6500 rpm, and 119 lb·ft at 5000 rpm. The United States 2004-2005 Mazdaspeed MX-5 turbo is based on this engine rather than the newer BP-Z3 and produces at 6000 rpm and of torque at 4500 rpm with slightly reduced compression ratio of 9.5:1. The Mazdaspeed turbo engine has no VICS, but does have VTCS which is often mistaken to be related to VICS.

Applications:
* 1999-2000 Mazda MX-5/Roadster/Miata
* 2004-2005 Mazdaspeed MX-5

====BP-Z3====
In 2001, Mazda introduced the still BP-Z3 (also called BP-VE) variant of the &quot;BP&quot; engine. It features S-VT variable valve timing on the intake side, no more VICS, but there is Variable Tumble Control System (VTCS) in the BP-Z3. A similar looking but effectively very different set of valves that restrict the intake on cold start for emissions purposes, rather than the torque enhancing set of partial butterflies that increase velocity that are used in VICS. This was found in the 2001+ Miata. The Z family is an evolution of this engine.

In Australia, a turbocharged version of this engine produced and in the Mazda MX-5 &quot;SP&quot;.

<text>The Mazda Z-series is a smaller gasoline inline-four engine ranging in displacements from 1.3 L to 1.6 L. They are the evolution of the cast-iron block B-engine.

The Z-engine has 16-valves operated by dual overhead camshafts, which are in turn driven by a timing chain (ZJ/Z6/ZY only). The block of the 98-02 Z5, ZM and ZL engine is cast iron same as the earlier B series of engines. 

Other Z engines have aluminum alloy block and head, with cast-iron cylinder liners.
The block features split upper and lower block assembly for added strength and rigidity, special long intake manifold for added torque, S-VT continuous variable valve timing, and a stainless steel 4:1 exhaust header.

In 2011, Mazda started to introduce the SkyActiv-G as a new, more economical option for vehicles that were equipped with the Mazda Z-engine. Production of the Z-series halted in 2014, being the last year of the Mazda2, Verisa as well as Mazda3 of their generations. Mazda moved on to the full SkyActiv architecture in their vehicle lineup, including running only the aforementioned SkyActiv-G engine, now offered in larger displacements, alongside a new SkyActiv-D turbo-diesel engine.

==Z5==
The Z5-DE was used in the 1995-1998 Mazda Protegé, Mazda Lantis (Astina) and in Mazda Familia Neo (1994–1997). Bore and stroke were . 

The Z5 engine was introduced as the first of a newer line of Mazda Z-series engines. The Z series was a new design based on the B-series block, block internals and oil-pan and a different DOHC head. Early versions of this motor had a chain driven exhaust cam.

The block is cast iron, the oil-pan is a 2-piece design with an upper aluminum and lower stamped steel, piston oil squirters are standard. The cylinder head was a compact design with round intake and exhaust ports. JDM versions produce and . There was also lean-burn version introduced in August 1995; this model produces and sees gas mileage improvements of ten to fifteen percent in the standard Japanese test cycle.

==ZJ==

The ZJ is available with either continuous cam-phasing VVT ZJ-VE or a high-efficiency Miller cycle ZJ-VEM .

Applications:
* 2003–2014 Mazda Demio ZJ-VE
* 2007–2014 Mazda Demio ZJ-VEM

==ZY==
 ZY-VE 
* Used in the Demio/Mazda2 (2002-2014), Verisa and Axela/Mazda3

==ZL==
 EEC, JIS, ZL-DE 

 JIS ZL-VE 
The 1.5 L ZL-VE makes more power than the slightly larger 1.6 L Z6/M-DE its due to variable valve timing on the intake cam (S-VT).

Applications:
* 1999-2003 Mazda Familia
==ZM==
 ZM-DE 
The ZM engine, has an identical bore yet slightly longer stroke than the ZL as well as a revised head with round intake and exhaust ports. It has exactly the same bore and stroke as the previous generation B6. Some European variants would use VICS on the intake manifold.

 ZM-II was a variant of the ZM designated to the company Haima to use on the Haima Family. When the Mazda contract to Haima expired the engine was rebranded as a ZM-D and no longer would bear any Mazda markings on the valve cover.

The ZL-VE and ZM-DE are closely related engines with an equal bore and share some major parts. The ZL has a stroke of whilst the ZM has .

Applications:
* 1998-2002 Mazda Familia
* 2003-2013 Mazda3

<text>The Saimaa Canal (; ; ) is a transportation canal that connects lake Saimaa with the Gulf of Finland near Vyborg, Russia. The canal was built from 1845 to 1856 and opened on 7 September 1856 (Old Style: 26 August 1856).
It was overhauled and widened in 1963–1968.

A system of inland waterways and canals in the 120 interconnected lakes of the south-central and south-east part of Finland (Finnish Lakeland) are reached through the canal. The network of deep channels in Lake Saimaa with at least a draught of covers . The deep channels extend all the way to Kuopio in Central Finland. The canal is closed in the winter.
==Topography==
The canal begins near Lauritsala, Lappeenranta, Finland, at coordinates () and ends in Vyborg, Russia, at coordinates (), connecting Lake Saimaa and the Vyborg Bay. On the way, it connects Lake Nuijamaa, on the Finnish–Russian border at coordinates (), and three smaller lakes in Russia.

===Dimensions===
* Length: 
** Finnish part: 
** Russian part: 
* Width: from 
* Total lift from the Gulf of Finland to Lake Saimaa: 
* The &quot;Saimax&quot; specification, in analogy to Panamax, specifies the maximum size and required equipment. The maximum dimensions allowed for a ship transiting the canal are:
** Length: 
** Beam (width): 
** Draft: 
** Height of mast: 
** Other requirements include for example that trading vessels must have two VHF radios and an automatic identification system (AIS).
* 217 boundary pillars between Canal Rented Zone and main territory of Russia.

===Locks===
There are a total of eight locks on the canal, raising the water level by some : the upper three locks in the Finnish part of the canal, and the lower five locks situated on the Russian side of the border:

Mälkiä Lock has the highest lift (), Tsvetochnoye Lock has the lowest ().

===Bridges===
The canal crosses 
* 12 motor vehicles bridges:
** 6 of them in Finland – 3 movable and 3 immovable
** the other 6 in Russia – 4 movable and 2 immovable 
* 2 railroad bridges (one on the each side of the border), both of them are immovable.

==History==

The canal, inaugurated in 1856, was built between the cities of Lappeenranta and Viipuri (now part of Russia), both of them then in the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire.

In the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940, Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and Vyborg to the Soviet Union; control of the canal was divided and traffic ended.

Finland obtained a 50-year lease on the Soviet part of the canal and Maly Vysotsky Island (Ravansaari) in 1963. Finland constructed a deeper canal, which opened in 1968. The annual rent during this lease increased only once.

In 2010, Finland obtained a second 50-year lease from Russia, starting in 2013. Maly Vysotsky was not included in the new lease. Negotiations in 2008 had raised the annual rent from to , with revisions every 10 years. The new agreement went into effect on 17 February 2012.

Regulations pertaining to maritime rules and employment of canal staff fall under Finnish jurisdiction; in all other cases Russian laws apply. Passports are required at the international boundaries, but Russian visas are not required for just passing through the canal.

The canal is as of 2024 open for traffic despite the Ukraine War.

<text>Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) is a mining company of Papua New Guinea (PNG) that is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). BCL operated the copper, gold and silver mine at the Panguna mine on Bougainville Island in PNG from to , when mining operations were officially halted due to militant activity. The mine has remained closed since then.

Mining giant Rio Tinto Group, which was historically Bougainville Copper Limited&#x27;s major shareholder, exited on 30 June 2016 when it transferred its 53.8 per cent shareholding for distribution to the Autonomous Bougainville Government and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.

==History==
The mine at Panguna was opened in 1972 and was majority-owned by Rio Tinto.

The mine was vitally important to the economy of Papua New Guinea. The PNG national government received a 20% share of profit from the mine, of which the Bougainvilleans received 0.5% to 1.25% share of the total profit.

The first Bougainville independence movement began to arise in the late 1960s, as people began to air their grievances against the then Australian colonial government over the handling of the Panguna mine. Australian External Territories Minister Charles Barnes was accused of telling the Bougainvillean people they would &quot;get nothing&quot;. The issue of compensation went to the High Court of Australia, where it was found that the compensation was inadequate under ordinary federal Australian law, but that as an External Territory, Papua New Guinea was not guaranteed the same standards that applied to mainland Australia. Papua New Guinea has been an independent country since 16 September 1975.

In 2010, using interviews with BCL executives and internal company documents, Dr Kristian Lasslet of the University of Ulster published adverse findings about the company from during the period of civil war. This research suggested that BCL placed pressure on the PNG government to assert its authority on Bougainville, following acts of industrial sabotage. The company purportedly aided the security forces by providing them with trucks, fuel, accommodation, communications equipment, storage space, messing facilities and office resources after concerns about human rights abuses became apparent. These allegations were previously denied by BCL&#x27;s former Chairman, but Dr Lasslett insists on their veracity.

In his first statement on Radio Australia Pacific Beat on 8 June 2010, the newly elected President of Bougainville, John Momis, declared that the Panguna mine has to be reopened to assure Bougainville&#x27;s future economic growth.

A referendum on Bougainville&#x27;s independence must be held no later than June 2020 under the Bougainville Peace Agreement.

During 2017, President Momis and the Autonomous Bougainville Government advocated for the re-opening of the Panguna mine.

In January 2018, the Bougainville government enacted an indefinite moratorium on renewing the licence of BCL over fears it could reignite violent civil conflict. Bougainville landowner groups were called to vote on allowing BCL to renew their mining licence and potentially reopen the Panguna mine, but lacked support. President Momis asserted that progressing with BCL could &quot;cause a total explosion of the situation again&quot;. The moratorium is a dramatic turnaround in policy from the Autonomous Bougainville Government, which determined landowners felt BCL didn&#x27;t deserve a social licence to run the mine.

In February 2018, BCL begun legal proceedings against the Autonomous Bougainville Government following the cancellation of the exploration license.

<text>Iziaslav IV Vladimirovich (1186 – 1236) was Prince of Terebovl&#x27; (1210), Novgorod-Seversk (until 1235) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1235–1236). He was the son of Vladimir Igorevich.

Iziaslav Vladimirovich was an Igorevich (descendant of Igor Sviatoslavich) and a member of a cadet branch of the Ol&#x27;govichi (descendants of Oleg Sviatoslavich). According to the Hypatian Chronicle, in 1234, Vladimirovich, with the help of the nomadic Polovtsy, campaigned against Vladimir Riurikovich and Daniil Romanovich of Volyn&#x27; and Galich. He defeated them near Torchesk, taking Vladimir prisoner. In the year 1235, Iziaslav IV marched from Kamenets with Mikhail Vsevelodovich, the Poles, the Russians, and the Polovtsy marched against Daniil again but were unsuccessful. According to the Novgorod First Chronicle, Prince Iziaslav and the Polovtsy joined Mikhail and troops from Chernigov to successfully attack and capture Kiev. After the victory, Iziaslav took the title of Grand Prince.

The Hypatian Chronicle and the Novgorod Chronicle disagree on which princes replaced each other in Kiev between 1235 and 1236. The Hypatian Chronicle states that Iaroslav Vsebelodovich took Kiev from Vladimir who was replaced by Mikail. The Novgorod Chronicle and, to a certain extent, the Nikon Chronicle, on the other hand, states that Iziaslav occupied Kiev after Vladimir was captured in 1235 implying that he replaced Iziaslav Mstislavich and not Vladimir.

<doc id="964691" wikidata="Q5522324" url="?curid=964691" title="Garden State Park Racetrack">
<text>Garden State Park was a harness and thoroughbred race track in Cherry Hill, Camden County, New Jersey. It is now the site of a high-end, mixed-use &quot;town center&quot; development of stores, restaurants, apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. Garden State Park&#x27;s 600 acre (≈1 square mile) land area is roughly bounded by Route 70, Haddonfield Road, Chapel Avenue, and New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Rail Line.

==History==
Garden State Park opened on July 18, 1942 after delays caused by raw material rationing at the United States&#x27; entry into World War II. Due to the seizure of 30,000 tons of structural steel by war authorities, developer Eugene Mori mostly constructed Garden State Park&#x27;s ornate Georgian-style grandstand of wood. Limited amounts of steel came from the demolition of New York City&#x27;s elevated railways. Despite this inauspicious start, &#x27;the Garden,&#x27; as it was known, was officially &#x27;out of the gate.&#x27;

In its heyday, it would host some of the finest thoroughbred racehorses in the nation at the signature Jersey Derby. Its Garden State Stakes and the Gardenia Stakes offered some of the largest purses available for two-year-olds. Horses raced at Garden State Park included Whirlaway, Citation, and Secretariat on a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon in early 1972 in the Garden State Futurity.

Garden State Park&#x27;s success sparked a wave of entertainment-oriented growth and development in the formerly rural community of Delaware Township, New Jersey (now Cherry Hill Township). Mori followed his achievement at the racetrack with the construction of the Cherry Hill Inn on the site of Abraham Browning&#x27;s Cherry Hill Farm (at Route 38 and Haddonfield Road); and in 1967 the Cherry Hill Lodge, also on Route 38 to the east of the Cherry Hill Mall. Soon to follow in 1961 was the Cherry Hill Shopping Center (today&#x27;s Cherry Hill Mall, the first enclosed shopping mall on the East Coast) and the super-luxurious Rickshaw Inn with its gold-plated roof, which was situated on Route 70 opposite Garden State Park.

Diagonally across Route 70 on the map in then-Delaware Township was the Latin Casino, adjacent to the Rickshaw and the Garden. This dinner nightclub hosted acts like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Liberace, Cherry Hill Estates neighbors Al Martino &amp; Frankie Avalon and more; before closing due to competition from casinos in Atlantic City.

Followed later by Atlantic City Race Course and Monmouth Park Racetrack (1946), Garden State Park became a crucial part of what was called the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; of New Jersey racing.

===Fire===
The &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; lost a leg on April 14, 1977, when a fire raged undetected at Garden State Park in the Colonial Room restaurant&#x27;s kitchen during a racing program. Despite no functional firefighting system, the wooden grandstand lasted long enough to allow more than 11,000 patrons and employees to escape the inferno. At 4:45 p.m., the walls and massive roof overhang of the grandstand gave way to the flames and reduced the structure to a smoking ruin. Despite the flying embers nearly igniting The Rickshaw Inn across the street and the wooden barns and stables on the backstretch, the damage was contained to the massive grandstand complex. Three people died in the fire. One patron (Ed Bucholski) and one employee were later found in the rubble, and one fire officer (John McWilliams) died of a heart attack on-scene. But, the next day, the vault with the previous days&#x27; &quot;take&quot; was opened, with the money intact; while outside on the track, horses continued to train.

===Rebuilding===
Despite the stables on the east side of the track remaining open for training, Garden State Park no longer held races until securities trader Robert Brennan financed construction of a new $178 million steel and glass grandstand, which opened on April 1, 1985. The first race that day followed the schedule from the day the original track burned. The track, running night programs, provided racing for standardbred harness racing as well as thoroughbred racing. The grandstand also had on the Clubhouse level The Phoenix Room, which also served as a large banquet hall that hosted events year-round.

On May 27, 1985, Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner Spend A Buck won the first Jersey Derby at the new Garden State Park, having earlier the same year won the Cherry Hill Mile and the Garden State Stakes, both at Garden State Park, and also the Kentucky Derby. The $2.6 million purse, including a $2 million bonus put up by Brennan for winning the four races, was the largest single purse in American racing history up to that point.

One of the controversial tax breaks the facility enjoyed was a legislative loophole that allowed a near total exemption from what would have been high county property taxes because it was categorized as a &quot;farm.&quot; It qualified for this special exemption because its operations generated horse manure that could be sold. The tax classification was allowed because the business &quot;produced over $500 per year in agricultural products.&quot;

Some of the annual races at Garden State Park Racetrack included:
* Betsy Ross Handicap
* Camden Handicap
* Gardenia Stakes
* Garden State Stakes (Garden State Futurity)
* Jersey Derby
* Trenton Handicap
* Vineland Handicap
* William Penn Stakes

Garden State Park never re-acquired its glamorous past. Over sixteen years, the track suffered from the apathy of New Jersey horsemen and New Jersey state officials, and unrestrained competition from the Atlantic City casinos. The final straw came when Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman vetoed legislation that would have permitted slot machines at New Jersey racetracks, a measure that possibly could have saved the Cherry Hill landmark.

===Demolition===
On May 3, 2001, 2,000 fans came to see the last racing program at Garden State Park. After 58 years, the Garden ran its last race.

On October 30, 2003, with the property sold to Realen-Turnberry for a mixed-use &#x27;town center&#x27; redevelopment, demolition started on the grandstand often referred to as a masterpiece. By late March 2004, all that remained of the racecourse was the original 1942 gatehouse on Route 70.

==Redevelopment==
Garden State Park was redeveloped into separate retail and residential sections, owned by M &amp; M Realty Partners. The retail section includes Costco, Wegmans, Home Depot, and Best Buy, and restaurants such as Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Panera Bread, Chick Fil-A, and Starbucks Coffee, The Cheesecake Factory, and Brio Tuscan Grille.

There have been plans by Parx Casino and Racing and Penn National Gaming, in a partnership, to build an Off Track Betting Parlor at the site of the former raceway near the lone standing entrance gate. On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, paving the way for states to legalize sports betting. New Jersey&#x27;s enabling legislation that regulates and taxes sports betting at casinos and racetracks will include the former racetrack. The planned OTB plans to offer sports betting in Cherry Hill.

<doc id="964693" wikidata="Q6798362" url="?curid=964693" title="Mazda OHV engine">
<text>After an early flirtation with V-twin engines, Mazda&#x27;s small cars of the 1960s were powered by OHV straight-2 and straight-4 engines. This family lasted from 1961 until the mid-1970s. Today, Mazda&#x27;s keicars use Suzuki engines. It was produced at the Hiroshima Plant in Hiroshima, Japan.

== AA==

The engine was a two-stroke, water-cooled straight-twin engine used in the Mazda Chantez and Mazda Porter &quot;kei&quot; car and truck unique to Japan from 1972 until 1976. The displacement is , producing and of torque.

== DA/DB==
The water-cooled OHV straight-four DA engine, used in the 1962 P360 Carol had a tiny bore and stroke. This was one of the smallest production four-cylinder automobile engines in history, only beaten by Honda&#x27;s inline-four unit used in the T360 truck. The engine&#x27;s small size was dictated by Japan&#x27;s kei car rules which offered special status to vehicles with engines displacing less than . Mazda&#x27;s tiny OHV was the only four-cylinder in the class in the 1960s, but was outperformed by 2-stroke and I3 powerplants from other companies.

When fitted to the B360/Porter light truck and van, the engine received the DB engine code.

==RA==
The RA engine was a larger version of the engine . It was used in the 1962-1964 P600 Carol and produced and of torque.

==SA==
The SA, a larger engine powered the 1963-1967 Mazda Familia and the 1966 Mazda Bongo. Bore and stroke was for this water-cooled OHV engine. In the Familia, the SA produces at 6,000 rpm, while the Bongo received a detuned version with at 5,000 rpm. For 1966 and 1967, the max power of the SA mounted in the Familia increased to (at the same engine speed), by increasing the compression ratio from 8.5:1 to 9.0:1.

==PB==
The PB engine, a separate development, used a square bore and stroke. It was a water-cooled OHV engine and first powered the 1967 Mazda Familia 1000. Output ranged from , depending on the application.

* Jan 1967 - Feb 1968 Mazda Familia 1000 Sedan, Van (Mazda 1000)
* Nov 1967 - 1973 Mazda Familia 1000 (Mazda 1000)

==TB==
One of the more-popular variants of this family was the TB unit found in the Familia/1200. Bore and stroke was . The 1200 Coupé used a Hitachi/Stromberg carburettor and 8.6:1 compression to produce at 6000 rpm and at 3000 rpm. This engine was built from 1968 until 1970 for passenger cars, until 1971 for the Familia Truck.

==UA/UB==
The UA (and the similar UB, for use in three-wheeled trucks) is a 1484 cc water-cooled overhead valve inline-four engine. It has a bore of and a stroke of . As installed in the original 1960 D1500 four-wheel truck, equipped with a sidedraft carburetor, it has a maximum horsepower of at 4600 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3000 rpm. The B1500&#x27;s output remained the same but for the second generation B1500 an improved engine cylinder head and valves and a downdraft carburetor increased the maximum horsepower to at 5200 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3400 rpm.

UA:
*March 1960 – 1965: (DUA12)
*1961-1965: Mazda B1500 (BUA/BUB)
*1965-1971: Mazda B1500/Proceed (BUD61)
*1965-1977: DUD9/DUE9

UB:
*1962-1971: 

==VA==
The VA first appeared in the Mazda D2000 of April 1962. With a bore and stroke of , displacement is . Power output was originally at 4600 rpm, but later models have at 5000 rpm.

* April 1962 - 1964 Mazda D2000, D2000 Microbus (DVA12)
* 1964 - 1973 Mazda Light Bus (AEVA)
* January 1964 - 1971 Mazda E2000 (EVA12/32)

<doc id="964700" wikidata="Q5528649" url="?curid=964700" title="Gay Street (Manhattan)">
<text>Gay Street is a short, angled street that marks off one block of Greenwich Village in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Although the street is part of the Stonewall National Monument (a U.S. national monument dedicated to the LGBT-rights movement), its name is likely derived from a family named Gay who owned land or lived there in colonial times. A newspaper of May 11, 1775, contains a classified ad where an &quot;R. Gay&quot;, living in the Bowery, offers a gelding for sale.

Since it was once too narrow to be a full-fledged street, the City of New York widened it in 1833. As a result, Federal houses of 1826-1833 line the west side of the street, while on the east side, following a hiatus caused by the Panic of 1837, the houses are from 1844 to 1860, with remnants of Greek Revival detailing in doorways and window surrounds.

The street extends from Christopher Street one block south to Waverly Place, between and roughly parallel to Sixth and Seventh Avenues. It runs through the site of a brewery owned by Wouter van Twiller, who succeeded Peter Minuit as Governor of New Netherland in 1633. The name first appeared officially in the Common Council minutes for April 23, 1827, which record a health inspector&#x27;s complaint against a privy belonging to one A. S. Pell of Gay Street.

The 1942 movie &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; portrays 13 Gay Street as the address of the building where most of the action, including a murder, occurs. The opening shots of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s video for &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; were shot on Gay Street in September 1983. In 1996, Sheryl Crow made a video on Gay Street for the song &quot;A Change Would Do You Good.&quot;

As part of the Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019 celebration, which marked the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, ten ornamental street signs honoring the LGBT community were installed on Gay Street. The signs, carrying labels such as &quot;Lesbian St&quot; and &quot;Bisexual Street&quot;, were arranged in the colors of a pride flag. Several 19th-century houses on the west side of Gay Street were demolished starting in 2022.

In some parts documentations, it is referred to as the D4, however no UC engine block was ever stamped D4. in 1980, this engine (and the smaller TC) was modernized and turned into the new E-series engine, intended for front-wheel drive applications.

==UB==
The original 1966 Luce 1500 used a SOHC inline-four with square bore and stroke. This engine, also used in the Capella and Grand Familia for a short while, was replaced by the stroked NA engine (below).

Applications:
* 1966–1972 Mazda Luce 1500 SUA, SUAV
* 1970–1973 Mazda Capella SU2A
* 1971–1973 Mazda Grand Familia S/808/818 SU4A, SU4V

==NA==
The SOHC NA engine was a UB, stroked to . JDM output was at 6000 rpm, with maximum torque of at 3500 rpm. US-spec was at 5000 rpm, with maximum torque of at 3500 rpm with a single Nikkei carburetor. The rest of the world received a version. Later on, this engine was also referred to as H6.

Applications:
* 1973.11–1978 Mazda Grand Familia/808/818 SN3A, SN4A
* 1974–1977 Mazda 808 (US)
* 1977–198? Mazda B1600/Proceed PE2N
* 1970.05 – 1978.09 Mazda Capella/616 SNA
* 1978.10 – 1982.09 Mazda Capella/626 CB2NS

==VB==
A stroked to version of the UB/NA, retaining the same bore, was used in the 1968-1972 Luce 1800 and the 1975-1979 Mazda B1800s for the US market. In Canadian market B-series trucks, it was installed as early as 1970. Output for the 1972 Luce was JIS at 5500 rpm and at 3000 rpm. Export model outputs varied, with European market models claiming DIN (all other figures remaining the same).

* 1968–1972 Mazda Luce / 1800 SVA
* 1970–1977 Mazda B1800 (BVD61, North America)
* 1977–1979 Mazda B1800 (US)

<text>Messier 68 (also known as M68 or NGC 4590) is a globular cluster found in the east south-east of Hydra, away from its precisely equatorial part. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. William Herschel described it as &quot;a beautiful cluster of stars, extremely rich, and so compressed that most of the stars are blended together&quot;. His son John noted that it was &quot;all clearly resolved into stars of 12th magnitude, very loose and ragged at the borders&quot;.

M68 is centred about 33,600 light-years away from Earth. It is orbiting our galaxy&#x27;s galactic bulge with a great eccentricity of 0.5. This takes it to 100,000 light years from the center. It is one of the most metal-poor globular clusters, which means it has a paucity of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The cluster may be undergoing core-collapse, and it displays signs of being in rotation. The cluster may have been acquired in its gravitational tie to the Milky Way through accretion from a satellite galaxy.

As of 2015, 50 variable stars have been identified in this cluster; the first 28 being identified as early as 1919–20 by American astronomer Harlow Shapley. Most of the variables are of type RR Lyrae, or periodic variables. Six of the variables are of the SX Phoenicis variety, which display short pulsating behavior.

<text>Messier 67 (also known as M67 or NGC 2682) and sometimes called the King Cobra Cluster or the Golden Eye Cluster is an open cluster in the southern, equatorial half of Cancer. It was discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in 1779. Estimates of its age range between 3.2 and 5 billion years. Distance estimates are likewise varied, but typically are . Estimates of 855, 840, and 815 pc were established via binary star modelling and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting.

==Description==
M67 is not the oldest known open cluster, several Milky Way clusters are known to be older, yet farther than M67. It is a paradigm study object in stellar evolution:
* it is well-populated
* has negligible amounts of dust obscuration
* all its stars are at the same distance and age, save for approximately 30 anomalous blue stragglers

M67 is one of the most-studied open clusters, yet estimates of its physical parameters such as age, mass, and number of stars of a given type, vary substantially. Richer et al. estimate its age to be 4 billion years, its mass to be 1080 solar masses (), and number its white dwarfs at 150. Hurley et al. estimate its current mass to be and its initial mass to be approximately 10 times as great.

It has more than 100 stars similar to the Sun, and numerous red giants. The total star count has been estimated at well over 500. The ages and prevalence of Sun-like stars had led some astronomers to theorize it as the possible parent cluster of the Sun. However, computer simulations disagree on whether the outer Solar System would have survived an ejection from M67, and the cluster itself would probably not have survived such an ejection event.

The cluster contains no main sequence stars bluer (hotter) than spectral type F, other than perhaps some of the blue stragglers, since the brighter stars of that age have already left the main sequence. In fact, when the stars of the cluster are plotted on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, there is a distinct &quot;turn-off&quot; representing the stars which have terminated hydrogen fusion in the core and are destined to become red giants. As a cluster ages, the turn-off moves progressively down the main sequence to cooler stars.

It appears that M67 has a bias toward heavier stars. One cause of this is mass segregation, the process by which lighter stars gain speed at the expense of more massive stars during close encounters, which moves them to greater average distance from the center of the cluster or allows escape altogether.

A March 2016 joint AIP/JHU study by Barnes et al. on rotational periods of 20 Sun-like stars, measured by the effects of moving starspots on light curves, suggests that these approximately 4 billion-year old stars spin in about 26 days – like the Sun, which has a period at the equator of 25.38 days. Measurements were carried out as part of the extended K2 mission of Kepler space telescope. This reinforces the applicability of many key properties of the Sun to stars of the same size and age, a fundamental principle of modern solar and stellar physics. The authors abbreviate this as the &quot;solar-stellar connection&quot;.

==Planets==
A radial velocity survey of M67 has found exoplanets around five stars in the cluster: YBP 1194, YBP 1514, YBP 401, Sand 978, and Sand 1429. A sixth star, Sand 364, was also thought to have a planet, but a follow-up study did not find evidence for it and concluded that the radial velocity variations have a non-planetary origin, likely stellar variability.

<text>The iron-block, alloy head E family was an evolution of Mazda&#x27;s xC design. It was released in June 1980 with the introduction of the first front-wheel drive Mazda Familias and Ford Lasers. Some later variants of the E5-powered Mazda Familia and Ford Laser in Japan incorporated a full-time 4WD drivetrain. All E engines were chain-driven, 8-valve SOHC. Notable features include siamesed cylinders, aluminium rocker arms and pistons, thin block walls, and single valve springs - all in the interest of reducing weight.

==E1==

The E1 was found in the 1980–1985 Mazda Familia and Ford Laser. It used a bore x stroke with 9.2:1 compression ratio and produced and (DIN). It was not replaced when the new Familia/323 appeared in 1985. The E1 was strictly intended for export markets where taxes based on engine size made this a popular alternative. It was never available in Japan, nor in North America or Australia.

==E3==

The larger E3 displaces with a wider bore and the same 9.2:1 compression ratio. It produced and (JIS gross) in Japan or and (DIN) for export market. It was found in the 1980–1985 Mazda Familia, Ford Laser and FWD 1981–1986 Mazda GLC. It was used until August 1994 for the Mazda Familia Van/Wagon (323) and continued until around 1997 for Ford Laser taxi fleets in Indonesia.

==E5==

The E5 pushed the stroke to an undersquare with 9.0:1 compression ratio. It was used in the 1980–1985 Mazda Familia, Ford Laser and FWD 1981–1986 Mazda GLC. It was also fitted to the rear-wheel drive Familia Cargo/323 Wagon in the mid-eighties, replacing the earlier UC engine. This engine produced and (JIS gross) in Japan and and (DIN) for export market.

===E5F===

The E5F was a fuel-injected variant of the E5, released in 1982 and available only in Japan. It produced and (JIS gross).

===E5S===
In certain markets a twin-carburetted, high-compression (10.0:1) version exists, dubbed the E5S. Available for Mazda 323 GT and Ford Laser Sport. For 1982 and 1983, this engine was equipped with two Hitachi DCT306W-L1/R1 carburettors, it produced and (DIN). Late in 1983, new two Hitachi DCS306-31 carburettors appeared and produced and (DIN).

===E5T===

The flagship turbocharged, lower-compression (8.2:1) pistons, fuel-injected and non-intercooled variant of the E5 was the E5T. Released in 1983 and available only in Japan, the E5T utilized an IHI-supplied VJ1 turbocharger running approximately to produce as much as and (JIS gross). Other notable advancements included an integrated knock sensor (supplied by Mitsubishi) and multi-point fuel injection as standard.

This was Mazda&#x27;s first production 4-cylinder turbo engine and was found in the top-of-the-line 1982–1985 Mazda Familia &quot;XGi-R Turbo&quot; and Ford Laser &quot;S Turbo&quot; as well as the early Mazda Familia &quot;XG Turbo&quot;, &quot;XG-R Turbo&quot; and Ford Laser &quot;TX3 Turbo&quot; models. Most of the technological features found in this engine were carried over to the later Mazda B6T.

===E5T Carb===

A strange carburettor turbocharged version of the E5 was the E5T Carb. It was exclusively available in Australia as part of the &quot;White Lightning&quot; Ford Laser limited-edition package of just 300 cars released in June 1985. The engine started out as a normal E5S and then an IHI RHB52 turbocharger was fitted, setup in a blow-through style, with boost limited to just . A modified version of the stock carburettor known as a &quot;Solex 32 DIS (turbo)&quot; was fitted to provide fuelling. A Compuspark ignition system with knock sensor was also added to prevent engine damage if the driver ever used a lower octane fuel than the 97 RON that was recommended. As the carburettors were not boost referenced, they were difficult to maintain and often suffered from float rupture or excessive flooding. Unlike its more reliable fuel-injected counterpart, the E5T carb turbo setup was notoriously difficult to maintain and some cars had the turbo systems removed instead of having them replaced. This engine produced and .

<text>Spamalot (also known as &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot: A Musical (Lovingly) Ripped Off from the Motion Picture &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail) is a stage musical with score by John Du Prez and Eric Idle, with lyrics and book by Idle. Based on the 1975 film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, the musical offers a highly irreverent parody of Arthurian legend, with the title being a portmanteau of Spam and Camelot.

The original 2005 Broadway production directed by Mike Nichols received 14 Tony Award nominations, winning in three categories, including Best Musical. During its initial run of 1,575 performances, the production was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $168 million. Tim Curry starred as King Arthur in the original Broadway and West End productions. It was one of eight UK musicals commemorated on Royal Mail stamps, issued in February 2011. 

A Paramount Pictures film adaptation, directed by Casey Nicholaw in his directorial debut from a script by Idle, was in pre-production as of 2021. Idle later stated on Twitter that the film would not be made due to two other of his former colleagues vetoing the project.

==Synopsis==

===Before the show===
A recording encourages members of the audience to &quot;let your cell phones and pagers ring willy-nilly,&quot; and comments that they should &quot;be aware there are heavily armed knights on stage that may drag you on stage and impale you.&quot; This was recorded by Eric Idle.

===Act I===
A historian narrates a brief overview of medieval England. In a miscommunication between the actors and the narrator, the actors sing an introductory song about Finland (&quot;Fisch Schlapping Song&quot;). The Historian returns, irritated, and tells the frolicking Finns that he was talking about England, not Finland. The scene immediately changes to a dreary, dark village with penitent monks in hooded robes chanting Latin and hitting themselves with books (&quot;Monk&#x27;s Chant&quot;). King Arthur travels the land with his servant, Patsy, who follows him around banging two coconut shells together to make the sound of a horse&#x27;s hooves as Arthur &quot;rides&quot; before him. Arthur aims to recruit Knights of the Round Table to join him in Camelot (&quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Song&quot;). Arthur and Patsy encounter a pair of sentries who begin debating the probability of finding a coconut in a non-tropical climate.

Robin, a collector of plague victims, and Lancelot, a handsome and hot-tempered man, meet as Lancelot attempts to dispose of the sickly Not Dead Fred. Although a plague victim, the man insists that he is not dead yet and he can dance and sing. He begins performing a dance number, but is soon knocked unconscious with a shovel by an impatient Lancelot (&quot;He Is Not Dead Yet&quot;). Lancelot and Robin agree to become Knights together; Lancelot wants to fight in battles, and Robin wants to sing and dance professionally. Not Dead Fred revives, declaring he will serve as Robin&#x27;s musician, only to be promptly killed by Lancelot. 

While attempting to recruit a peasant named Dennis Galahad, Arthur explains that he became King of England because the Lady of the Lake gave him Excalibur, the sword given only to the man fit to rule England. However, Dennis and his mother, Mrs. Galahad, are political radicals and say that any king who has not been elected by the people has no legitimate right to rule over them. To settle the issue, Arthur asks the Lady of the Lake and her Laker Girls (named after the cheerleading squad) to appear before Dennis, which they promptly do (&quot;Come with Me&quot;). Cheered on by the girls (&quot;Laker Girls Cheer&quot;), the Lady of the Lake turns Dennis into Sir Galahad and together, they sing a generic Broadway love song (&quot;The Song That Goes Like This&quot;). Arthur knights Galahad, and subsequently Robin and Lancelot. Together with Sir Bedevere and the &quot;aptly named&quot; Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show, a knight resembling Don Quixote who promptly apologises and leaves, they become the Knights of the Round Table (&quot;All for One&quot;).

The five knights gather in Camelot, a deliberately anachronistic place resembling Las Vegas&#x27;s Camelot-inspired Excalibur resort, complete with showgirls, oversized dice and the Lady of the Lake as a lounge singer reminiscent of Liza Minnelli (&quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot;/&quot;The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)&quot;). In the midst of their revelry, they are contacted by God (a recording voiced by John Cleese in the original Broadway production, Eric Idle in the version that toured the UK, and Steve Martin in the Broadway revival), who tells them to locate the Holy Grail. 

Urged on by the Lady of the Lake (&quot;Find Your Grail&quot;), the knights set off. They travel throughout the land until they reach a castle, only to be viciously taunted by lewd French soldiers. Bedevere comes up with the idea to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit in the style of the Trojan horse; however, the knights realize after the fact that they forgot to hide inside the rabbit before the French soldiers took it. Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French soldiers begin taunting them again, sending cancan dancers after them and throwing barnyard animals at them (&quot;Run Away!&quot;). Arthur and his followers manage to run into the safety of the wings before the French soldiers catapult the Trojan rabbit at them.

===Act II===
The knights are separated after the French soldiers&#x27; attack. Arthur and Patsy become lost in a &quot;dark and very expensive forest&quot;. Arthur meets the terrifying but silly Knights Who Say Ni, who demand a shrubbery. Arthur has no idea where to find a shrubbery, but Patsy cheers him up (&quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;) and they find a shrubbery shortly after. Sir Robin wanders the forest with his minstrels (&quot;Brave Sir Robin&quot;), and they encounter the Black Knight, who scares Robin away. Arthur then encounters the Black Knight and defeats him by cutting off both his arms and legs, impaling his still-alive torso on a door, and leaving to give the shrubbery to the Knights Who Say Ni. 

Arthur and Robin reunite. The Knights Who Say Ni accept the shrubbery, but then demand that Arthur put on a musical and bring it to Broadway &quot;but not an Andrew Lloyd Webber&quot;, with the mere mention of his name causing everyone to cover their ears and scream in pain (in the United Kingdom, this became a West End musical; on the tour, they must put on a &quot;Broadway musical&quot;). Robin insists that it would be impossible to accomplish this next task, since a successful Broadway (or West End) musical requires the involvement of Jews (&quot;You Won&#x27;t Succeed on Broadway&quot;). Robin proves his point in a wild production number filled with Ashkenazi Jewish cultural references, a list of Jewish celebrities known for their work on Broadway (including Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand, Stephen Sondheim, and as a joke in the 2023 revival, George Santos), and a &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; parody involving a bottle dance with Grails instead of bottles. Arthur and Patsy promptly set off in search of Jews. 

(In countries that don&#x27;t have a tradition of Jews in the theatre, the lyrics of &quot;You Won&#x27;t Succeed on Broadway&quot; are sometimes changed to instead describe the high production standards and acting talent needed to stage a successful musical in that country. For example, in the South Korean version, Sir Robin sings about recent successful musicals that were staged in Seoul during the previous decade. Meanwhile, members of the ensemble appear onstage dressed as various characters from those musicals. Among these characters are a cat from &quot;Cats&quot;, Kenickie from &quot;Grease&quot;, Kim from &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, the Phantom from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and Velma Kelly from &quot;Chicago&quot;.)

While the Lady of the Lake laments her lack of stage time (&quot;Diva&#x27;s Lament (What Ever Happened to My Part?)&quot;), Sir Lancelot receives a letter of distress from someone who is being forced into an arranged marriage. He is very surprised to find that the supposed &quot;damsel in distress&quot; is actually an effeminate young man named Prince Herbert (&quot;Where Are You?&quot;). Herbert asks Lancelot to help him escape. Herbert&#x27;s music-hating father, the King of Swamp Castle, cuts the rope that Herbert is using to climb out of the window, and Herbert falls to his apparent death. Lancelot is a bit puzzled at the king&#x27;s actions, but it is revealed that Herbert was saved at the last minute by Lancelot&#x27;s sidekick, Concorde. When Herbert begins to explain, in song, how he was saved, the king charges at Herbert with a spear, preparing to kill him. Lancelot steps in to save Herbert, then gives a tearful, heartfelt speech to the king about sensitivity on Herbert&#x27;s behalf. The king correctly guesses that Lancelot is homosexual, and Herbert helps Lancelot accept his sexuality in a disco number (&quot;His Name Is Lancelot&quot;). 

King Arthur begins to give up hope of ever putting on a Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, ignoring Patsy (&quot;I&#x27;m All Alone&quot;). The Lady of the Lake appears and tells Arthur that he and the Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along (in some productions she also points out Patsy&#x27;s presence, to which Arthur claims that he sees Patsy as &quot;family&quot; and thus does not always consider him a separate person). Patsy reveals he is half Jewish, but did not previously inform Arthur because &quot;that&#x27;s not really the sort of thing you say to a heavily armed Christian.&quot; The Lady of the Lake tells Arthur that to end the musical, he must find the Grail and marry someone. Arthur proposes to the Lady of the Lake, and she happily accepts. They plan to marry after Arthur finds the Grail (&quot;Twice in Every Show&quot;).

The knights reunite and meet Tim the Enchanter, who warns them of the danger of a killer rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight&#x27;s head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, knocking down a nearby hill and revealing that the &quot;evil rabbit&quot; was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre. They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats. The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 – which is house right of the center aisle – of Rows A, B, C, or D. In the West End production a word is revealed – DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.) 

After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they&#x27;re &quot;a bit stumped with the clue thing&quot; and asks God to &quot;give them a hand&quot;. A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a seat number in the audience. The grail is &quot;found&quot; (with some sleight of hand) under the seat, and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a polaroid photo (&quot;The Holy Grail&quot;). Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake (who reveals that her name is Guinevere) and Lancelot marries Herbert, who finally gets a chance to sing. Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre. The King of Swamp Castle attempts to interrupt the finale and stop all of the &quot;bloody singing&quot;, but Lancelot knocks him unconscious with a shovel. The company then invites the audience to partake in a sing-along of &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;. (&quot;Act 2 Finale / Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)&quot;).

===Notes===
The song &quot;You Won&#x27;t Succeed on Broadway&quot; was changed to &quot;You Won&#x27;t Succeed in Showbiz&quot; for the London production and later replaced with the &quot;Star Song&quot; on the UK tour.

===Doubling of parts===
In tribute to the film, where six actors played the majority of the male parts (and a few female ones), several actors play multiple roles; the only major characters not doubling are Arthur and the Lady of the Lake. In the Broadway production, the following doubling is used:

* Lancelot/2nd Sentry/The French Taunter/Knight of Ni/Tim the Enchanter
* Robin/1st Sentry/Brother Maynard/2nd Guard
* Galahad/King of Swamp Castle/Black Knight
* Patsy/Mayor of Finland/1st Guard
* Bedevere/Mrs Galahad/Concorde
* The Historian/Prince Herbert/Not Dead Fred/Lead Minstrel/The French Taunter&#x27;s Best Friend

Sara Ramirez doubled as a witch and a cow in the Chicago previews, but both parts were cut during the pre-Broadway run. Several pairs of characters originally played by the same Monty Python member were reduced to one: the Dead Collector and Sir Robin (Idle), the Large Man with a Dead Body and Sir Lancelot (Cleese), and Dennis the Active Peasant and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin). In the 2023 production, the actor playing the Historian does not portray the French Taunter&#x27;s best friend, but instead plays a mime, as well as a baby and a nun.

==Production history==
===Chicago (2005)===

Previews of the show began in Chicago&#x27;s Shubert Theatre (now the CIBC Theatre) on 21 December 2004; the show officially opened there on 9 January 2005.

Two musical numbers were dropped from Act One while the production was still in Chicago. During the scene set in the &quot;Witch Village&quot;, the torch song &quot;Burn Her!&quot; was originally performed by Sir Bedevere, The Witch, Sir Robin, Lancelot and Villagers. At the French Castle, &quot;The Cow Song&quot;, in a parody of a stereotypical film noir/cabaret style, was performed by The Cow and French Citizens. Before the two songs were cut in Chicago, the lead vocals in both songs were sung by Sara Ramirez. This gave the Lady of the Lake six songs in Act One, but no further appearances until scene five in Act Two, for &quot;The Diva&#x27;s Lament&quot;.

===Broadway (2005-09)===

The musical previewed on Broadway, at New York&#x27;s Shubert Theatre, beginning 14 February 2005, ahead of an official opening on 17 March. Mike Nichols directed, and Casey Nicholaw choreographed. The production won the Tony Award for Best Musical and was nominated for 14 Tony Awards at the 59th Tony Awards. The show played its final performance on 11 January 2009 after 35 previews and 1,575 performances; it was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $168 million, recouping its initial production costs in under six months.

The original Broadway cast included Tim Curry as King Arthur, Michael McGrath as Patsy and other roles (e.g., the lazy Castle Guard and the Mayor of Finland), David Hyde Pierce as Sir Robin and other roles (e.g., Brother Maynard and the daft Castle Guard), Hank Azaria as Sir Lancelot and other roles (e.g., the French Taunter, Knight of Ni, and Tim the Enchanter), Christopher Sieber as Sir Galahad and other roles (e.g., the Black Knight and Prince Herbert&#x27;s Father), and Sara Ramirez as the Lady of the Lake. It also included Christian Borle as Prince Herbert and other roles (e.g., the Historian and Not Dead Fred), Steve Rosen as Sir Bedevere and other roles (e.g., Concorde and Dennis&#x27;s Mother) and John Cleese as the (recorded) Voice of God.

===West End (2006-09)===

A London production opened at the Palace Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue in the West End, commencing 30 September 2006 (London premiere 16 October). Tim Curry and Christopher Sieber reprised their roles from the Broadway production. They were joined by Hannah Waddingham as the Lady of the Lake, Tom Goodman-Hill as Sir Lancelot, Robert Hands as Sir Robin, David Birrell as Patsy, Tony Timberlake as Sir Bedevere and Darren Southworth as Prince Herbert. The London production closed on 3 January 2009.

=== First national tour (2006–09) ===

A North American tour commenced in spring 2006, and the cast included Michael Siberry as King Arthur (replaced by Gary Beach in 2008), Jeff Dumas as Patsy, Richard Holmes as Lancelot, Bradley Dean as Galahad and Tom Deckman as The Historian. Richard Chamberlain later joined the tour as King Arthur. The tour continued through the summer 2009, and played its final performances at the Segerstrom Hall in Costa Mesa where it closed on 18 October 2009.

===Las Vegas (2007-08)===
A production of the musical began in Las Vegas, Nevada, previewed on 8 March 2007 and opened on 31 March 2007 at the Wynn Las Vegas in the newly renamed Grail Theater. As with other Las Vegas transfers of Broadway musicals, including &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Spamalot&quot; was condensed to run in ninety minutes without an intermission. Among the cuts were the song &quot;All For One&quot;, most of the song &quot;Run Away&quot;, the Knights of Ni receiving their shrubbery, and the &quot;Make sure he doesn&#x27;t leave&quot; scene with Prince Herbert&#x27;s guards.

Actor John O&#x27;Hurley starred as King Arthur, with J Anthony Crane playing Lancelot. Due to the Las Vegas production, the North American touring company would not perform in California, Arizona, or Nevada. Although initially contracted to run for up to ten years its final performance was on 18 July 2008.

=== UK tour (2010-12) ===
A UK tour scheduled for later in 2009 was initially postponed, the producers commenting &quot;Due to unforeseen circumstances the UK Tour of Spamalot will not be taking place as scheduled in 2009&quot;, but eventually started at the New Wimbledon Theatre on 29 May – 5 June 2010. Phill Jupitus played King Arthur in the UK tour.
Todd Carty played Patsy, assistant to King Arthur for the duration of the tour. Marcus Brigstocke made his musical theatre debut as King Arthur following Jupitus&#x27; departure. Jodie Prenger, Hayley Tamaddon, Amy Nuttall and Jessica Martin shared the role of The Lady of the Lake.

The UK tour also featured for the first time a re-working of the song &quot;You Won&#x27;t Succeed on Broadway&quot; which has been renamed &quot;You Won&#x27;t Succeed in Showbiz&quot;. The theme of the song has been changed from poking fun at the need for Jewish input into Broadway productions and instead mocks the cross over of celebrities in musicals and reality television competitions such as &quot;The X Factor&quot;. It notably pokes fun at reality TV celebrities including Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole and Susan Boyle (who is shot by Sir Robin when she begins to sing).

After the West End revival (2012-14), the production toured again from April 2015 starring Joe Pasquale, Todd Carty and Sarah Earnshaw.

=== Second/Third national tour (2010–13) ===
A second North American tour launched on 24 September 2010 from Waterbury, Connecticut, and ended 26 June 2011 in Dallas, Texas. This tour featured a non-Equity cast that included Caroline Bowman as the Lady of the Lake. Another non-Equity North American tour was undertaken in 2013.

=== West End revival (2012-14) ===
The touring production played a limited seven-week run in the West End during the summer of 2012 at the Harold Pinter Theatre. Marcus Brigstocke shared the role of King Arthur with Jon Culshaw for those seven weeks, with Bonnie Langford playing Lady of the Lake. The production moved to the Playhouse Theatre on 14 November 2012, and ran until 12 April 2014. During 2013 a number of celebrities each played the part of God for a week in aid of charity, including Professor Brian Cox, Gary Lineker, Barbara Windsor, Brian May and Michael Palin.

Other notable cast members during the run of the West End revival included Stephen Tompkinson, Joe Pasquale, Les Dennis and Richard McCourt as King Arthur, Anna-Jane Casey and Carley Stenson as Lady of the Lake, Warwick Davis and Dominic Wood as Patsy, Daniel Boys as Sir Lancelot, Jon Robyns as Sir Galahad and Rob Delaney as Sir Robin.

=== Hollywood Bowl (2015) ===
A three evening performance at the Hollywood Bowl was undertaken in 2015, with Eric Idle appearing in the role of The Historian, and other cast members including Christian Slater, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Craig Robinson, Merle Dandridge, Warwick Davis, Kevin Chamberlin and Rick Holmes. The script was updated and included many Los Angeles specific jokes.

=== Kennedy Center and Broadway revival (2023) ===
The Kennedy Center for Performing Arts staged Spamalot in the Eisenhower Theater as part of their Broadway Center Stage series from May 12-23, 2023. Directed and choreographed by Josh Rhodes, the production starred James Monroe Iglehart as King Arthur, Alex Brightman as Sir Lancelot, Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer as the Lady of the Lake, Rob McClure as The Historian/Prince Herbert, Michael Urie as Sir Robin, Nik Walker as Sir Galahad, Matthew Saldivar as Patsy, and Jimmy Smagula as Sir Bedevere. The production featured the original script with new jokes, such as a reference to then-Congressman George Santos in &quot;You Won&#x27;t Succeed on Broadway,&quot; a &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; reference replacing Robin&#x27;s piano playing in the same song, and DC-related ad libs.

It was announced on August 2, 2023, that the Kennedy Center production would transfer to Broadway at the St. James Theatre, with previews scheduled to begin October 31 before a November 16 opening. Iglehart, Kritzer, Urie, Smagula, and Walker reprised their roles from the Kennedy Center, joined by Christopher Fitzgerald as Patsy and Ethan Slater as The Historian/Prince Herbert. The production opened with Taran Killam playing Lancelot; Brightman reprised his role after Killam left the production in January 2024. Urie played his final performance as Sir Robin on January 21, 2024. On January 23, Jonathan Bennett made his Broadway debut as Sir Robin. The production closed on April 7, 2024. A national tour is planned to begin performances in the autumn of 2025.

=== International productions ===
A new Australian production started in Melbourne in November 2007 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, with the official premiere on 1 December. The cast featured Bille Brown as King Arthur, Ben Lewis as Sir Galahad, Stephen Hall as Sir Lancelot and Mark Conaghan as Prince Herbert The Australian production closed on 5 April 2008, due to lack of ticket sales and no tour followed. In October 2014, Harvest Rain Theatre Company under the direction of producer Tim O&#x27;Connor staged a production of &quot;Spamalot&quot; with a cast list including Jon English as King Arthur, Simon Gallaher as Patsy, Julie Anthony as the Lady of the Lake, Frank Woodley as Sir Robin, Chris Kellett as Sir Lancelot, Stephen Hirst as Galahad and Shaun McCallum as Sir Bedevere. The production was presented at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane.

The first translated production, in Spanish, ran at Teatre Victòria, Barcelona from 9 September 2008 to 10 May 2009. Directed by Catalan Comedy Group Tricicle and choreographed by Francesc Abós, the cast included Jordi Bosch as King Arthur and Marta Ribera as the Lady of the Lake. The production moved to Madrid in September 2009 A German production premiered in January 2009 at the Musical Dome in Cologne.

The production moved to Oscarsteatern in Stockholm on 15 September 2011 where it played through 29 April 2012. Nina Söderquist, who starred as Lady of the Lake in the West End production was intended to reprise her role, but became pregnant. She joined the show when it moved to Stockholm, along with Henrik Hjelt as Sir Belvedere. In May 2011, the original UK touring production played at Politeama Rossetti in Trieste. Eric Idle attended the opening night on 24 May.

The Mexican premiere of the show was in July 2011 in Mexico City. The show ran for over 500 performances across the country. The Japanese production ran from 9 to 22 January 2012 at the Akasaka Blitz theater in Tokyo before playing Morinomiya Piloti Hall in Osaka from 2 February to February to 6 February. The production featured Yūsuke Santamaria as King Arthur, Aya Hirano as the Lady of the Lake, Magy as Patsy, Yuya Matsushita as Sir Galahad and Tsuyoshi Muro as Prince Herbert. The South Korean production was presented by OD Musical Company, and CJ Entertainment&#x27;s Performing Arts division (now a part of CJ E&amp;M); incidentally, CJ CheilJedang, the sister company of CJ Group&#x27;s entertainment business, manufactures Spam products under license since 1987.

 This production was directed by Lezlie Wade.

== Title ==
Book-writer and lyricist Eric Idle explained the title in a February 2004 press release:

==Reactions by Monty Python members==

The show has had mixed reactions from Idle&#x27;s former colleagues in Monty Python.

Terry Gilliam, in an audio interview, describes it as &quot;Python-lite&quot;. He later told the BBC News, &quot;It helps with the pension fund, and it helps keep Python alive. As much as we&#x27;d like to pull the plug on the whole thing it carries on – it&#x27;s got a life of its own.&quot;

Terry Jones – who co-directed the original film with Gilliam – expressed his opinions forthrightly in May 2005: &quot;&quot;Spamalot&quot; is utterly pointless. It&#x27;s full of air … Regurgitating Python is not high on my list of priorities.&quot; However, when asked whether he liked &quot;Spamalot&quot; during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM &quot;The Bone&quot; shortly after the musical&#x27;s opening on Broadway, Jones said, &quot;Well, I thought it was terrific good fun. It&#x27;s great to see the audience loving it. I suppose I had reservations as far as … well … the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well … I mean, they really are good … but I just quite don’t understand what that&#x27;s about. It isn’t really &#x27;Python.&#x27; It is very much Eric.&quot; Jones went on to say, &quot;I think the best parts of the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings &#x27;Whatever Happened to My Part&#x27; since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she&#x27;s really furious! That is one of the great moments where the show really comes alive for me.&quot;

In an October 2006 interview, Michael Palin said, &quot;We’re all hugely delighted that &quot;Spamalot&quot; is doing so well. Because we’re all beneficiaries! It&#x27;s a great show. It&#x27;s not &#x27;Python&#x27; as we would have written it. But then, none of us would get together and write a &#x27;Python&#x27; stage show. Eric eventually ran out of patience and said, &#x27;Well, I’ll do it myself then.&#x27; He sent us bits and songs and all that and we said, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s all right, have a go.&#x27; But its success is so enormous that it took us all by surprise, including Eric, and now we’re just proud to be associated with it, rather pathetically.&quot;

When asked by a &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; reporter in 2008 if he had to be persuaded to provide the recorded voice of God in the musical, John Cleese said, &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s right. And in the end I think &quot;Spamalot&quot; turned out splendidly. It&#x27;s had a tremendous run. I defy anyone to go and not have a really fun evening. It&#x27;s the silliest thing I’ve ever seen and I think Eric did a great job.&quot;

The last verse of the &quot;Finland&quot;/&quot;Fisch Slapping Dance&quot; was incorporated into Spam sketch for the 2014 reunion show &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;.

==Critical reception and box-office==
The original production was a financial success. &quot;Variety&quot; reported advance ticket sales of $18 million, with ticket prices ranging from $36 to $179.

The show proved to be an early success when moving to London&#x27;s West End. After high advance ticket sales the show&#x27;s run was extended by four weeks, four months before the run commenced.
The play makes many references to the film and other material in the Python canon, including a line from &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, nods to &quot;Ministry of Silly Walks&quot;, the &quot;Election Night Special&quot; and &quot;Dead Parrot sketch&quot; routines, a bar from &quot;Spam&quot; worked into &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot;, a rendition of the song &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; from the film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979), and the &quot;Fisch Schlapping Song&quot; which is a reference to both &quot;The Fish-Slapping Dance&quot; and the song &quot;Finland&quot;. Another reference is actually part of the &quot;Playbill&quot; of the show; there are several gag pages about a musical entitled &quot;Dik Od Triaanenen Fol (Finns Ain&#x27;t What They Used To Be)&quot;. This gag programme was written by Palin, and echoes the &quot;faux&quot;-Swedish subtitles in the credits of the original &quot;Grail&quot; Python film.

&quot;Spamalot&quot; makes various references to other musicals and musical theatre in general, such as: &quot;The Song That Goes Like This&quot; (a spoof of Andrew Lloyd Webber productions and many other Broadway power ballads); &quot;Whatever Happened To My Part&quot; reminiscent of &quot;And I Am Telling You I&#x27;m Not Going&quot; from &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, the knights doing a dance reminiscent of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, and another reminiscent of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (including the music); Sir Lancelot&#x27;s mimicking of Peter Allen in &quot;His Name Is Lancelot&quot;; the character of Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show being &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;&#x27;s Don Quixote; a member of the French &quot;army&quot; dressed as Éponine from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;; and a line pulled from &quot;Another Hundred People&quot; from Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot; by the &quot;damsel&quot; Herbert.

The show has not escaped criticism. In &quot;Slate&quot;, Sam Anderson wrote,
&quot;Python was formed in reaction to exactly the kind of lazy comedy represented by &quot;Spamalot&quot; — what Michael Palin once described as the &#x27;easy, catch-phrase reaction&#x27; the members had all been forced to pander in their previous writing jobs... &quot;Spamalot&quot; is the gaudy climax of a long, unfunny tradition of post-Python exploitation – books, actions figures, video games – that treats the old material as a series of slogans to be referenced without doing any of the work that made the lines so original in the first place.&quot;

About the West End version, Charles Spencer wrote in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful night, and I fart in the general direction of anyone who says otherwise&quot; (echoing a joke from the show). According to Paul Taylor in the &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;it leaves you that high and weak with laughter, thanks not just to the Python provenance of the basic material but to the phenomenal speed, wit, cheek and showbiz knowingness of the direction, which is by the great veteran, Mike Nichols&quot;. Michael Billington in the &quot;Guardian&quot; was less enthusiastic, though, stating &quot;while I&#x27;m happy to see musicals spoofed, the show&#x27;s New York origins are clearly exposed in a would-be outre number which announces &quot;we won&#x27;t succeed in show business if we don&#x27;t have any Jews&quot;: a Broadway in-joke that has little purchase this side of the Atlantic.&quot; Billington adds, &quot;With hand on heart, I&#x27;d much rather watch Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Camelot&quot; than Eric Idle&#x27;s smart-arsed &quot;Spamalot&quot;.&quot;

===Coconut orchestra world record===
On 22 March 2006, to mark the first anniversary of the official Broadway opening, the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Coconut Orchestra&quot;, 1,789 people clapping together half coconut shells, performed in Shubert Alley, outside the theatre. The claim was officially recognised by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. This record was broken by 5,877 people in Trafalgar Square at 7 pm on 23 April 2007, led by the cast from the London production, along with Jones and Gilliam, with the coconuts used in place of the whistles in &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;. This formed part of London&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Day celebrations that year and was followed by a screening of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.

===Other===

In 2006, the London cast of &quot;Spamalot&quot; performed excerpts at the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;.

On 10 March 2007, &quot;Spamalot&quot; partnered with HP Sauce (the classic British brown sauce, now made in the Netherlands following a contentious decision to close its factory in Birmingham, England) to produce 1,075 limited edition bottles featuring a unique &quot;Spamalot&quot; take on the classic HP design. The bottles were available exclusively via Selfridges, London and came in a presentation box with a numbered certificate. 1,075 was chosen to celebrate, absurdly, &quot;1,075 years of the show running in London&quot;.

In July 2007 it was announced that the London production would solve the problem of replacing Hannah Waddingham as the Lady of the Lake through a TV talent show in Sweden. The programme, called &quot;West End Star&quot;, which began airing on TV3 on 8 December 2007, announced Nina Söderquist as the winner on 2 February 2008. Söderquist took up the role of the Lady of the Lake, with a standing ovation, on 11 February 2008.

===DVD===
Portions of the &quot;Spamalot&quot; original cast recording were featured (with accompanying Flash animation) as a special feature in the 2006 &quot;Extraordinarily Deluxe Two-Disc Edition&quot; DVD re-release of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
In the original Broadway production, Sara Ramirez sang the line, &quot;I&#x27;ve no Grammy, no reward/I&#x27;ve no Tony Award.&quot; Ironically, the show&#x27;s original cast album won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006 and Ramirez won the Tony for Best Featured Actress at the 59th Tony Awards in 2005. The two awards led to a minor change to the song &quot;The Diva&#x27;s Lament&quot;. Initially, the line became &quot;My Tony Award/won&#x27;t keep me out of Betty Ford&#x27;s&quot;. When Lauren Kennedy took over for Sara Ramirez, it became &quot;My predecessor won awards/and now she&#x27;s in Betty Ford&#x27;s&quot; but was later changed to, &quot;All our Tony Awards/won&#x27;t keep me out of Betty Ford&#x27;s.&quot; In the touring production, Pia Glenn sings &quot;All our &quot;goddamn&quot; awards/won&#x27;t keep me out of Betty Ford&#x27;s.&quot; For a change, Hannah Waddingham in the London production sings &quot;I&#x27;m as depressed as I can be/ I&#x27;ve got constant PMT&quot;.

The touring production has garnered Boston&#x27;s Elliot Norton Award for Outstanding Visiting Production.

==Television==
A special edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; was a television documentary on the history of &quot;Spamalot&quot;. It features numerous segments with Eric Idle and John Du Prez explaining the process of writing the songs, plus interviews with UK and US cast members. It included scenes from the rehearsal of the West End show, and was first broadcast on 15 October 2006.

==Cancelled film adaptation==
In May 2018, 20th Century Fox announced a film adaptation was in the works with Idle writing the script and Casey Nicholaw attached to direct. The film was reportedly fast-tracked with casting announced soon with shooting to begin in early 2019. The next month it was reported that the studio was looking to cast Benedict Cumberbatch as King Arthur, Peter Dinklage as his servant Patsy and Tiffany Haddish as the Lady of the Lake. Cumberbatch was taken out of consideration due to his involvement in &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;.

At the time of the release of his memoir &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life: A Sortabiography&quot; in December 2019, Idle said in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;(the movie is) all ready to go&quot; and that it &quot;is not very expensive&quot;. He cited the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney as a factor to the film&#x27;s delay, saying it caused &quot;everything (to come) to a grinding halt&quot;. He also stated in an interview around the same time with WBUR-FM that Haddish is still being offered the role of the Lady of the Lake, and that the script has &quot;mostly been solved&quot;.

On 6 January 2021, it was announced that the project would move to Paramount Pictures and that it was set to begin pre-production, with Nicholaw officially confirmed to direct from Idle&#x27;s script and Dan Jinks joining as a producer. Two years later, Idle said that the film would not be happening.

In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the producer of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, over royalties for &quot;Spamalot&quot;. He was paid 1/14 of the portion of the profits paid to the Pythons. The court ruled that he was a full Python partner and was to be paid 1/7 of the portion paid to the Pythons. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater, prompting them to produce &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;.

<doc id="964721" wikidata="Q1145275" url="?curid=964721" title="Windtalkers">
<text>Windtalkers is a 2002 American war film directed and co-produced by John Woo, starring Nicolas Cage, Adam Beach, Peter Stormare, Noah Emmerich, Mark Ruffalo, and Christian Slater. It is based on the real story of code talkers from the Navajo nation during World War II. The film was theatrically released in the United States on June 14, 2002, receiving mixed reviews and grossing just $77.6 million worldwide against a production budget of $115 million.

==Plot==
During World War II, US Marine corporal Joe Enders returns to active duty after having surviving on the Solomon Islands against the Imperial Japanese Army that killed his entire squad and wounded his left ear. Enders and Sgt. Pete &quot;Ox&quot; Henderson receive new assignments to protect Navajo code talkers Pvt. Ben Yahzee and Pvt. Charlie Whitehorse in a JASCO.

Yahzee and Whitehorse, childhood friends from the Navajo tribe, are trained to send and receive coded messages that direct artillery fire. Enders and Henderson are instructed to kill their code talkers if capture is imminent so that the code cannot fall into enemy hands. Both Enders and Henderson resent their new assignments, and the Navajos also endure racial harassment by some of the white Marines, notably Private Chick.

Yahzee and Whitehorse takes part in the invasion of Saipan in the Mariana Islands. After the beachhead is secured, the Marines come under friendly fire from U.S. artillery. With Yahzee&#x27;s radio destroyed and the convoy unable to call off the bombardment, Yahzee suggests disguising himself as a Japanese soldier and slip behind enemy lines to commandeer a radio, with Enders as his prisoner. Yahzee redirects artillery fire onto the Japanese position.

That night, the Marines camp in the nearby village of Tanapag. As Yahzee is temporarily assigned back to the command post to translate a code, Enders becomes increasingly torn over killing Yahzee and following his orders, but his request to be relieved from duty is denied. The next morning, Japanese soldiers ambush the village. Henderson is killed and Whitehorse is about to be captured. Realizing that the Japanese will torture him for the code, Enders throws a grenade at Whitehorse, killing him and his captors. Yahzee returns to Tanapag and, seeing Whitehorse&#x27;s body, confronts Enders, revealing that he killed Whitehorse. An outraged Yahzee aims his weapon at Enders but cannot bring himself to kill him. Enders later confesses that he hated having to kill Whitehorse and that, like Henderson, his mission was to protect the code above all else.

The Marines are sent on another mission and once again ambushed near a deadly minefield on Mount Tapochau. Enders, Yahzee, Chick, and Cpl. Pappas take cover on a ridge and see Japanese artillery fire from the top of the ridge attacking a Marine convoy below their position. Still enraged over Whitehorse&#x27;s death, Yahzee charges the Japanese line, but he and Enders are both shot as they call in an airstrike on the Japanese artillery. Knowing the Japanese will capture and torture him for the code, Yahzee begs Enders to kill him. Enders refuses and manages to carry Yahzee to safety as U.S. Navy planes arrive and bomb the Japanese positions. Despite their success Enders was mortally wounded and dies.

Back in the U.S., Yahzee and his family sit atop Point Mesa in Monument Valley, Arizona, and, wearing the sacred necklaces and Navajo ceremonial dress, perform the Navajo ritual of paying their respects to Enders.

==Production==
In November 1998, it was announced United Artists would develop &quot;Windtalkers&quot; as a directorial vehicle for John Woo.

Filming locations on Hawaii included Kualoa Ranch, the location where &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; were shot. To portray the Marines in the film the producers recruited extras that were volunteers from Schofield Barracks Army Base, Hickam Air Force Base, Pearl Harbor Naval Station, and Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station. Some of the actual Marines from 4th Force Recon Company were used in the film portraying their actual job. Some violence was trimmed in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. This violence trim was restored for the Director&#x27;s cut released on DVD running 153 minutes. The film&#x27;s release date was moved from November 9, 2001, to June 14, 2002, due to the September 11th terrorist attacks.

For the F6F Hellcat fighters that appear in the beach-landing scenes on Saipan, the producers used computer-generated versions.

==Reception==
===Box office===
$41 million at the US box-office and a total of $77.6 million worldwide, against a production budget of $115 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Windtalkers&quot; has an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 166 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;The action sequences are expertly staged. &quot;Windtalkers&quot;, however, sinks under too many clichés and only superficially touches upon the story of the code talkers.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51% based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, remarking that &quot;the filmmakers have buried it beneath battlefield cliches, while centering the story on a white character played by Nicolas Cage&quot;. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;A powerful premise turned into a stubbornly flat, derivative war movie.&quot;

The film was criticized for featuring the Navajo characters only in supporting roles; they were not the primary focus of the film. The film was ranked number four on Careeraftermilitary.com&#x27;s &quot;10 Most Inaccurate Military Movies Ever Made&quot; which also included &quot;The Patriot&quot;, &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, &quot;U-571&quot;, &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;, &quot;Red Tails&quot;, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; and &quot;Flyboys&quot; on its list of falsified war movie productions.

About the response, John Woo said: &quot;The main themes of Windtalkers are friendship and understanding. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a John Wayne movie, just a typical American hero film with explosions every few minutes. I had to make them understand that this wasn&#x27;t a story about heroes. It&#x27;s a story about a man and his own demons, trying to redeem himself from war. I made the movie that way, but some people in the studio didn&#x27;t appreciate it and, in the end, I guess neither did the audience.&quot; In 2023, Woo said: “There were not many people who really understood that movie or liked it. It was not good timing. The movie had to be released in 2001. Then 9/11 happened, so they had to push it. They were so afraid audiences wouldn’t want to watch a war movie at that time. I had a conflict with the writers. I said, “My kind of movie is usually about friendship, respect, and honor.” But the writers didn&#x27;t feel good about that. They said, “The enemy is the enemy. The enemy has to be destroyed.” I tried to make it a human story. The audience didn&#x27;t expect a movie about friendship. But I&#x27;m still proud of that movie.“

<doc id="964723" wikidata="Q6138069" url="?curid=964723" title="Mazda K engine">
<text>The Mazda K-series automobile engine is a short stroke 60° 24-valve V6 with belt-driven DOHC and all-aluminium construction. Displacements range from 1.8 L to 2.5 L. They all use a 27-degree DOHC valvetrain with directly actuated hydraulic bucket lifters. The K-series also features a highly rigid aluminum split-crankcase engine block design with 4-bolt mains with additional bolts securing the lower block, an internally balanced forged steel crankshaft with lightweight powder forged carbon steel connecting rods. They were designed with the intent of being as compact as possible for short-hood front-wheel drive applications.

One unique innovation of the K-series was the introduction of Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). Based on the Helmholtz resonance principle, the intake manifold is equipped with 3 chambers tuned to a specific resonant frequency. The computer dynamically switches between each resonant chamber to achieve the appropriate resonant frequency for the engine&#x27;s rpm. This effect optimizes volumetric efficiency over a given rpm range to provide maximum torque over the entire rpm range. VRIS is used on the K8, KF, and KL but nearly all modern Mazda V6s are now using this technology.

The K-series all have a 7,000 rpm redline with 7500-7800 rpm limiter, which given the engine design is conservative. The KJ-ZEM Miller cycle engine had a 6,000 rpm redline, but was only available with an automatic transmission.

==K8==

The K8 is among the smallest production V6 engines ever; and also the first K-series engine to be used in a Mazda car (in the Mazda MX-3). It was a DOHC 4-valve design with VRIS and a bore and stroke of . It produced in US trim (sometimes referred to as &quot;K8-DE&quot;), and in Japanese trim (the &quot;K8-ZE&quot;) on introduction in 1991 and and at its best. The displacement was held under 2000cc to minimize the annual Japanese road tax obligation.

Applications:
* Mazda MX-3
* Eunos 500

==KF==

* 2.0 L KF - bore and stroke - The 2.0 L KF engine was available in various states of tune. The KF-DE produced and and later on and . The JDM version KF-ZE engine produced and . The Lantis Type R variant produced and .
* 1991-1997 Mazda MX-6
* 1992-1993 Eunos 500, 
* 1993-2002 Eunos 800
* 1992-1998 Efini MS-8
* 1993-1999 Xedos 6
* 1993-2002 Xedos 9
* 1993-1996 Mazda Lantis Type R 170 hp (124 kW; 172 PS) 190 N•m (140 lb•ft)
* 1994-1996 Mazda 323f V6 GLX
* 1996-1998 Mazda 323f ZXi
* 1992-1995 Ford Telstar TX5 Ghia
* 1993-2003 Mazda 626 LX
==KJ-ZEM==

The bore and stroke, KJ-ZEM was one of Mazda&#x27;s most technologically advanced engines. It employs the &quot;Miller cycle&quot; which uses a supercharger to increase compression efficiency by decreasing the compression losses (i.e., flywheel energy used to compress the intake charge in the cylinder); and thereby increasing the net power output of the V6. It was used in the T-platform cars. The supercharger used is the twin-screw type with electronic boost control. Power output was and . The KJ-ZEM was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1995 through 1998.

Applications:
* Mazda Millenia S
* Eunos 800
* Mazda Xedos 9

==KL==

The KL family uses an bore and stroke. It includes the Japan-only KL-ZE, which produced and . Another variant, the KL-DE (also known as the KL-03 outside the US, and fitted to 2.5-litre Ford Probes) was the worldwide version, with in various applications. In 1998 a revised version of the KL known as the KL-G4 was used in the 626. It featured solid lifters, a cast crankshaft to reduce rotating mass and a reworked intake system. The distributor was replaced with a Ford EDIS coil-pack ignition.

Mazda introduced a key technology with these engines, known as the Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). A series of two butterfly valves coupled with electronically controlled actuators varied the volume and length of a resonant chamber within the intake manifold. The valves actuate at particular engine frequencies (i.e. rpms) to produce optimal torque/horsepower output at any given engine speed. The valve operates to create three specific first-order resonant frequencies that increase cylinder air charge. All three resonances are used from 0 to 6250 rpm (6800 for the KL-ZE). Above that threshold, the first primary resonant chamber is again used, but at this engine speed the pressure wave from the second-order resonant frequency aids in charging the cylinder.

<text>Robert P. Koch (born January 13, 1960) is the president and CEO of the Wine Institute, acting as its chief lobbyist in Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, California.

==Life and career==
Koch is the son of George William Koch, past president of the Grocery Manufacturers Association. In 1992, he married Dorothy Bush, George H. W. Bush&#x27;s daughter, at a private ceremony held at Camp David—the only couple to have married there. They have two children, and Dorothy has two children from her first marriage.

Koch started his career in politics working for Tony Coelho and was part of his campaign to become House Majority Whip. Koch later became staff director for House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt before joining the Wine Institute. Since becoming President and CEO in June 2003, membership has grown 70% to over 1,000 Californian wineries and affiliated businesses which are predominantly family owned. He has a substantial equity interest in the Central European Distribution Corporation, a company that manufactures and distributes vodka in Poland.

Koch is active in raising funds to find a cure for Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis.

<text>Messier 69 or M69, also known NGC 6637, and NGC 6634, is a globular cluster in the southern constellation of Sagittarius. It can be found 2.5° to the northeast of the star Epsilon Sagittarii and is dimly visible in 50 mm aperture binoculars. The cluster was discovered by Charles Messier on August 31, 1780, the same night he discovered M70. At the time, he was searching for an object described by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1751–2 and thought he had rediscovered it, but it is unclear if Lacaille actually described M69.

This cluster is about 28,700 light-years away from Earth and from the Galactic Center, with a spatial radius of 45 light-years. It is a relatively metal-rich globular cluster that is a likely member of the galactic bulge population. It has a mass of with a half-mass radius of , a core radius of , and a tidal radius of . Its center has a bright luminosity density of ·pc−3 (meaning per cubic parsec). It is a close neighbor of its analog M70 – possibly only 1,800 light-years separates the two.

<doc id="964733" wikidata="Q10578860" url="?curid=964733" title="Mazda Wankel engine">
<text>The Mazda Wankel engines are a family of Wankel rotary combustion car engines produced by Mazda.

Wankel engines were invented in 1950s by Felix Wankel, a German engineer. Over the years, displacement has been increased and turbocharging has been added. Mazda rotary engines have a reputation for being relatively small and powerful at the expense of poor fuel efficiency. The engines became popular with kit car builders, hot rodders and in light aircraft because of their light weight, compact size, tuning potential and inherently high power-to-weight ratio—as is true for all Wankel-type engines.

Since the end of production of the Mazda RX-8 in 2012, the engine was produced only for single seater racing, with the one-make Star Mazda Championship being contested with a Wankel engine until 2017; the series&#x27; transition to using a Mazda-branded piston engine in 2018 temporarily ended the production of the engine. In 2023, Mazda reintroduced the engine as a generator for the 2023 MX-30 e-Skyactiv R-EV plug-in hybrid.

==Displacement==

Wankel engines can be classified by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (crank throw, eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator&#x27;s major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine. The displacement of rotor can be calculated as

:formula_1

Note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotor&#x27;s displacement, because with the eccentric shaft – crankshaft – spinning at three times the rate of the rotor, only one power stroke is created per output revolution, thus only one face of the rotor is actually working per &quot;crankshaft&quot; revolution, roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of similar displacement to a single rotor face. Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, , with a crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a rotor radius and crankshaft offset.

As Wankel engines became commonplace in motorsport, the problem of correctly representing their displacement for the purposes of competition arose. Rather than force participants who drove vehicles with piston engines, who were the majority, to halve their quoted displacement, most racing organizations decided to double the quoted displacement of Wankel engines.

The key for comparing the displacement between the 4-cycle engine and the rotary engine is in studying the number of rotations for a thermodynamic cycle to occur. For a 4-cycle engine to complete a thermodynamic cycle, the engine must rotate two complete revolutions of the crankshaft, or 720°. By contrast, in a Wankel engine, the engine rotor rotates at one-third the speed of the crankshaft. Each rotation of the engine (360°) will bring two faces through the combustion cycle (the torque input to the eccentric shaft). This said, it takes three complete revolutions of the crankshaft, or 1080°, to complete the entire thermodynamic cycle. To get a relatable number to compare to a 4-stroke engine, compare the events that occur in two rotations of a two-rotor engine. For every 360° of rotation, two faces of the engine complete a combustion cycle. Thus, for two whole rotations, four faces will complete their cycle. If the displacement per face is , then four faces can be seen as equivalent to .

Extrapolating to the case of where three whole rotations is a complete thermodynamic cycle of the engine with a total of six faces completing a cycle, per face for six faces yields .

==40A==
Mazda&#x27;s first prototype Wankel was the 40A, a single-rotor engine very much like the NSU KKM400. Although never produced in volume, the 40A was a valuable testbed for Mazda engineers, and quickly demonstrated two serious challenges to the feasibility of the design: &quot;chatter marks&quot; in the housing, and heavy oil consumption. The chatter marks, nicknamed &quot;devil&#x27;s fingernails&quot;, were caused by the tip-seal vibrating at its natural frequency. The oil consumption problem was addressed with heat-resistant rubber oil seals at the sides of the rotors. This early engine had a rotor radius of , an offset of , and a depth of .

==L8A==
The very first Mazda Cosmo prototype used a L8A two-rotor Wankel. The engine and car were both shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show. Hollow cast iron apex seals reduced vibration by changing their resonance frequency and thus eliminated chatter marks. It used dry-sump lubrication. Rotor radius was up from the 40A to , but depth dropped to .

One-, three-, and four-rotor derivatives of the L8A were also created for experimentation.

==10A==
The 10A series was Mazda&#x27;s first production Wankel, appearing in 1965. It was a two-rotor design, with each chamber displacing so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; the series name reflects this value (&quot;10&quot; suggesting 1.0 litres). These engines featured the mainstream rotor dimensions with a depth.

The rotor housing was made of sand-cast aluminium plated with chrome, while the aluminium sides were sprayed with molten carbon steel for strength. Cast iron was used for the rotors themselves, and their eccentric shafts were of expensive chrome-molybdenum steel. The addition of aluminium/carbon apex seals addressed the chatter mark problem.

===0810===
The first 10A engine was the 0810, used in the &quot;Series I&quot; Cosmo from May 1965 to July 1968. These cars, and their revolutionary engine, were often called L10A models. Gross output was at 7000 rpm and at 3500 rpm, but both numbers were probably optimistic (rpm of the crankshaft).

The 10A featured twin side intake ports per rotor, each fed by one of four carburetor barrels. Only one port per rotor was used under low loads for added fuel economy. A single peripheral exhaust port routed hot gas through the coolest parts of the housing, and engine coolant flowed axially rather than the radial flow used by NSU. A bit of oil was mixed with the intake charge for lubrication.

The 0810 was modified for the racing Cosmos used at Nürburgring. These engines had both side- and peripheral-located intake ports switched with a butterfly valve for low- and high-RPM use (respectively)

Applications:
* 1965–1968 Mazda Cosmo &quot;Series I/L10A&quot;

===0813===

The improved 0813 engine appeared in July 1968 in the &quot;Series II/L10B&quot; Cosmo. Its construction was very similar to the 0810.

Japanese-spec gross output was at 7000 rpm and at 3500 rpm. The use of less-expensive components increased the mass of the engine from .

Applications:
* July 1968–September 1972 Mazda Cosmo &quot;Series II/L10B&quot;
* 1968–1973 Mazda R100/Familia Rotary

===0866===
The final member of the 10A family was the 1971 0866. This variant featured a cast-iron thermal reactor to reduce exhaust emissions and re-tuned exhaust ports. The new approach to reducing emissions was partly a result of Japanese Government emission control legislation in 1968, with implementation starting in 1975. Mazda called their technology REAPS (Rotary Engine Anti Pollution System). The die-cast rotor housing was now coated with a new process: The new Transplant Coating Process (TCP) featured sprayed-on steel which is then coated with chrome. Gross output was at 7000 rpm and at 3500 rpm.

Applications:
* 1972–1974 Mazda RX-3 (Japan-spec)

==3A==
Mazda began development on a single rotor engine displacing , and was designed for &quot;kei car&quot; use in the upcoming Mazda Chantez but was never placed into production. It was a slimmed down derivative of the 10A engine as fitted to the R100. A prototype engine is on display at the Mazda Museum in Hiroshima, Japan.

==13A==

The 13A was designed especially for front-wheel drive applications. It was a two-rotor design, with each chamber displacing so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; continuing earlier practice, the series name reflects this value (&quot;13&quot; suggesting 1.3 litres). This was the only production Mazda Wankel with different rotor dimensions: Radius was and offset was , but depth remained the same as the 10A at . Another major difference from the previous engines was the integrated water-cooled oil cooler.

The 13A was used only in the 1969–1972 R130 Luce, where it produced and . The next Luce was rear-wheel drive and Mazda would not make a front-wheel drive rotary vehicle until the development of the 8C for use in the 2021 Mazda MX-30, which is used to power an electric motor spinning the front axle.

Applications:
* 1970–1972 Mazda R130

==12A==
The 12A is an &quot;elongated&quot; version of the 10A: the rotor radius was the same, but the depth was increased by to . It continued the two-rotor design; with the depth increase each chamber displaced so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; the series name continues earlier practice and reflects this value (&quot;12&quot; suggesting 1.2 litres). The 12A series was produced for 15 years, from May 1970 through 1985. In 1974, a 12A became the first engine built outside of western Europe or the U.S. to finish the 24 hours of Le Mans (and in 1991 Mazda won the race outright with the 4-rotor R26B engine).

In 1974, a new process was used to harden the rotor housing. The Sheet-metal Insert Process (SIP) used a sheet of steel much like a conventional piston engine cylinder liner with a chrome plated surface. The side housing coating was also changed to eliminate the troublesome sprayed metal. The new &quot;REST&quot; process created such a strong housing, the old carbon seals could be abandoned in favour of conventional cast iron.

Early 12A engines also feature a thermal reactor, similar to the 0866 10A, and some use an exhaust port insert to reduce exhaust noise. A lean-burn version was introduced in 1979 (in Japan) and 1980 (in America) which substituted a more-conventional catalytic converter for this &quot;afterburner&quot;. A major modification of the 12A architecture was the 6PI which featured variable induction ports.

===Turbo===

The ultimate 12A engine was the electronically fuel-injected engine used in the Japan-spec HB series Cosmo, Luce, and SA series RX-7. In 1982 a 12A turbo powered Cosmo coupe was officially the fastest production car in Japan. It featured &quot;semi-direct injection&quot; into both rotors at once. A passive knock sensor was used to eliminate knocking, and later models featured a specially-designed smaller and lighter &quot;Impact Turbo&quot; which was tweaked for the unique exhaust signature of the Wankel engine for a 5-horsepower increase. The engine continued until 1989 in the HB Cosmo series but by that stage it had grown a reputation as a thirsty engine.

* Original output is at 6,500 rpm, and at 4,000 rpm.
* Impact Turbo output is at 6,000 rpm, and at 4,000 rpm.

Applications:
* 1982–1989 Mazda Cosmo
* 1982–1985 Mazda Luce
* 1984–1985 Mazda RX-7

==12B==
The 12B was an improved version of the 12A and was quietly introduced for the 1974 Mazda RX-2 and RX-3. It had increased reliability from the previous series and also used a single distributor for the first time: the earlier 12A and 10A were both twin distributor engines.

Applications:
* 1974–1978 Mazda RX-2
* 1974–1978 Mazda RX-3, at 6,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm (US)

==13B==

The 13B is the most widely produced rotary engine. It was the basis for all future Mazda Wankel engines, and was produced for over 30 years. The 13B has no relation to the 13A. Instead, it is a lengthened version of the 12A, having thick rotors. It was a two-rotor design, with each chamber displacing so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; the series name reflects this value (&quot;13&quot; suggesting 1.3 litres), as with the 13A of the same displacement but different proportions.

In the United States, the 13B was available from 1974 to 1978 and was then retired from sedans but continued in 1984–1985 RX-7 GSL-SE. It was then used from 1985 to 1992 in the RX-7 FC, in Naturally Aspirated or Turbocharged options, then once again in the RX-7 FD in a twin turbocharged form from 1992. It disappeared from the US market again in 1995, when the last US-spec RX-7s were sold. The engine was continually used in Japan from 1972&#x27;s Mazda Luce/RX-4 through 2002&#x27;s RX-7.

===AP===
The 13B was designed with both high performance and low emissions in mind. Early vehicles using this engine used the AP name.

Applications:
* 1975–1980 Mazda Cosmo &quot;AP&quot;
* 1974–1977 Mazda REPU (Rotary Engine Pickup)
* 1974–1977 Mazda Parkway
* 1975–1977 Mazda Roadpacer
* 1973–1978 Mazda RX-4
* 1975–1980 Mazda RX-5

===13B-RESI===
A tuned intake manifold was used in a Wankel engine for the first time with the 13B-RESI. RESI = Rotary Engine Super Injection. The so-called Dynamic Effect Intake featured a two-level intake box which derived a supercharger-like effect from the Helmholtz resonance of the opening and closing intake ports. The RESI engine also featured Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection. Output was much improved at and .

Applications:
* 1984–1985 Mazda HB Luce
* 1984–1985 Mazda HB Cosmo
* 1984–1985 Mazda FB RX-7 &quot;GSL-SE&quot;

===13B-DEI===
Like the 12A-SIP, the second-generation RX-7 bowed with a variable-intake system. Dubbed DEI, the engine features both the 6PI and DEI systems, as well as four-injector electronic fuel injection. Total output is up to at 6500 rpm and at 3500 rpm.

The 13B-T was turbocharged in 1986. It features the newer four-injector fuel injection of the 6PI engine, but lacks that engine&#x27;s eponymous variable intake system and 6PI. Mazda went back to the 4 port intake design similar to what was used in the &#x27;74–&#x27;78 13B. In &#x27;86–&#x27;88 engines the twin-scroll turbocharger is fed using a two-stage mechanically actuated valve, however, on &#x27;89–&#x27;91 engines a better turbo design was used with a divided manifold powering the twin-scroll configuration. For engines manufactured between &#x27;86-&#x27;88 output is rated at at 6500 rpm and at 3500 rpm.

Applications:
* 1986–1991 Mazda HC Luce Turbo-II, 
* 1986–1988 Mazda RX-7 (FC3S, S4) Turbo-II, 
* 1989–1991 Mazda RX-7 (FC3S, S5) Turbo-II, 

===13B-RE===

The 13B-RE from the JC Cosmo series was a similar motor to the 13B-REW but had a few key differences, namely it being endowed with the largest side ports of any later model rotary engine.

Injector sizes = PRI + SEC.

Approximately 5000 13B-RE optioned JC Cosmos were sold, making this engine almost as hard to source as its rarer 20B-REW big-brother.

Applications:
* 1990–1995 Eunos Cosmo, 

===13B-REW===
A sequentially-turbocharged version of the 13B, the 13B-REW, became famous for its high output and low weight. The turbos were operated sequentially, with only the primary providing boost until 4,500 rpm, and the secondary additionally coming online afterwards. Notably, this was the world&#x27;s first volume-production sequential turbocharger system. Output eventually reached, and may have exceeded, Japan&#x27;s unofficial maximum of DIN for the final revision used in the Series 8 Mazda RX-7.

Applications:
* 1992–1995 Mazda RX-7, 
* 1996–1998 Mazda RX-7, 
* 1999–2002 Mazda RX-7, 

==13G/20B==
In Le Mans racing, the first three-rotor engine used in the 757 was named the 13G.

The main difference between the 13G and 20B is that the 13G uses a factory peripheral intake port (used for racing) and the 20B (production vehicle) uses side intake ports.

It was renamed 20B after Mazda&#x27;s naming convention for the 767 in November 1987. As a three-rotor design, with each chamber displacing , three chambers (one per rotor) would displace , and so the new series name reflected this value (&quot;20&quot; suggesting 2.0 litres).

The three-rotor 20B-REW was only used in the 1990-1995 Eunos Cosmo. It was offered in both &quot;13B-RE&quot; and 20B-REW form. It displaced per set of three chambers (counting only one chamber per rotor) and used of boost pressure from twin sequential turbochargers to produce a claimed and .

A version of the 20B known as the &quot;R20B Renesis 3 Rotor Engine&quot; was built by Racing Beat in the US for the Furai concept car which was released on 27 December 2007. The engine was tuned to run powerfully on 100% ethanol (E100) fuel, produced in partnership with BP. During a &quot;Top Gear&quot; photo shoot in 2008, a fire in the engine bay combined with a delay to inform the fire crews, the car was engulfed and the entire car destroyed. This information was withheld until made public in 2013.

==13J ==
The first Mazda racing four-rotor engine was the 13J-M used in the 1988 and 1989 (13J-MM with two step induction pipe) 767 Le Mans Group C racers. In Group C and GTP this engine was replaced by the R26B, but continued to serve on in various Mazda supported entries in other championships around the world. These championships included, but were not limited to IMSA&#x27;s GTO and WSC Classes, and the Wesbank Modified Saloon Series. 

==R26B==
The most prominent 4-rotor engine from Mazda, the R26B, was used only in various Mazda-built sports prototype cars including the 787B and the RX-792P in replacement of the older 13J. In 1991 the R26B-powered Mazda 787B became the first Japanese car and the first car with anything other than a reciprocating piston engine to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans race outright. The R26B engine displaced per set of four chambers (counting only one chamber for each of the four rotors) – thus the &quot;26&quot; in the series name suggesting 2.6 litres – and developed at 9000 rpm. The engine design uses peripheral intake ports, continually variable geometry intakes, and an additional (third) spark plug per rotor.

== 13B-MSP Renesis ==
The Renesis engine – also 13B-MSP (Multi-Side Port) – which first appeared in production in the 2004 model-year Mazda RX-8, is an evolution of the previous 13B. It was designed to reduce exhaust emission and improve fuel economy, which were two of the most recurrent drawbacks of Wankel rotary engines. It is naturally aspirated, unlike its most recent predecessors from the 13B range, and therefore slightly less powerful than Mazda RX-7&#x27;s twin-turbocharged 13B-REW which develops .

The Renesis design features two major changes from its predecessors. First, the exhaust ports are not peripheral but are located on the side of the housing, which eliminates overlap and allows redesign of the intake port area. This produced noticeably more power thanks to an increased effective compression ratio; however, Mazda engineers discovered that when changing the exhaust port to the side housing, a buildup of carbon in the exhaust port would stop the engine from running. To remedy this, Mazda engineers added a water jacket passage into the side housing. Secondly, the rotors are sealed differently through the use of redesigned side seals, low-height apex seals and the addition of a second cut-off ring. Mazda engineers had originally used apex seals identical to the older design of seal. Mazda changed the apex seal design to reduce friction and push the new engine closer to its limits.

These and other innovative technologies allow the Renesis to achieve 49% higher output and reduced fuel consumption and emissions. Regarding hydrocarbon (HC) emission characteristics of the RENESIS, the use of the side exhaust port allowed for about 35 – 50% HC reduction compared to the 13B-REW with the peripheral exhaust port. With this reduction, the RENESIS vehicle meets USA LEV-II (LEV). The Renesis won International Engine of the Year and Best New Engine awards 2003 and also holds the &quot;2.5 to 3 liter&quot; (note that the engine is designated as a 1.3–litre by Mazda) size award for 2003 and 2004, where it is considered a 2.6 L engine, but only for the matter of giving awards. This is because although a 2-rotor wankel with chambers displaces the same volume in one output shaft rotation as that of a 1.3L four-stroke piston engine, the wankel will complete 2 full combustion cycles in the same amount of time that it takes the four-stroke piston engine to complete 1 combustion cycle. Finally, it was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2004 and 2005.

The Renesis has also been adapted for a dual-fuel use, allowing it to run on petrol or hydrogen in cars like the Mazda Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid and Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE.

All the Mazda rotary engines have been praised because of their light weight. The unmodified 13B-MSP Renesis Engine has a weight of , including all standard attachments (except the airbox, alternator, starter motor, cover, etc.), but without engine fluids (such as coolant, oil, etc.), known to make .

==16X==

Also known as the Renesis II, made its first and only appearance in the Mazda Taiki concept car at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show, but has not been seen since. It features up to , a lengthened stroke, reduced width rotor housing, direct injection, and aluminium side housings.

==8C==
The 8C engine is used as a generator for the 2023 MX-30 e-Skyactiv R-EV plug-in hybrid.

The 8C is a single rotor with a radius of 120mm, a depth of 76mm, using 2.5mm apex seals, and displacing 830cc making up to 75 hp (55 kW) at 4700rpm and 116 Nm (85 lb-ft) at 4000 rpm. It has a higher compression ratio of 11.9:1 and the first instance of Gasoline direct injection in a production rotary engine, which improves fuel economy by as much as 25%.

Various other technologies have been integrated to increase the efficiency of the engine further, including exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to reduce the combustion chamber temperatures and plasma spray coatings on the insides of the housings to reduce the friction on the rotor.

Changes have also been made to decrease the weight of the unit such as using aluminium side housings, which saved .

==Sales==
Mazda was fully committed to the Wankel engine just as the energy crisis of the 1970s struck. The company had all but eliminated piston engines from its products in 1974, a decision that nearly led to the company&#x27;s collapse. A switch to a three-prong approach (piston-gasoline, piston-Diesel, and Wankel) for the 1980s relegated the Wankel to sports car use (in the RX-7 and Cosmo), severely limiting production volume. But the company had continued production continually since the mid-1960s, and was the only maker of Wankel-powered cars when the RX-8 was discontinued from production in June 2012 with 2000 RX-8 Spirit R models being made for the JDM (RHD) market.

Though not reflected in the graph at right, the RX-8 was a higher-volume car than its predecessors. Sales of the RX-8 peaked in 2004 at 23,690, but continued to decline through 2011, when fewer than 1,000 were produced.

Currently, the engine is produced for SCCA Formula Mazda, and its professional Indy Racing League LLC dba INDYCAR sanctioned Pro Mazda Championship.

== 2011 onwards ==
Mazda last built a production street car powered by a rotary engine in 2012, the RX-8, but had to abandon it largely to poor fuel efficiency and emissions. It has continued to work on the technology, however, as it is one of the company&#x27;s signature features. Mazda officials have previously suggested that if they can get it to perform as well as a reciprocating engine they will bring it back, to power a conventional sports car.

In November 2011, Mazda CEO Takashi Yamanouchi announced that the company was still committed to producing the rotary engine, saying, &quot;So long as I remain involved with this company... there will be a rotary engine offering or multiple offerings in the lineup.&quot;

In November 2016, senior managing executive officer of Mazda research and development Kiyoshi Fujiwara told journalists at the Los Angeles motor show that the company would launch its first EV in 2019, and that it was likely to incorporate a rotary engine, but that the details were still &quot;a big secret.&quot; He did say, however, that the car is likely to use a new-generation rotary engine as a range extender, similar in concept to a BMW i3. In 2013, Mazda had displayed a Mazda2 RE prototype car, using a similar rotary range extender EV system.

In October 2017, Fujiwara told journalists that they were still working on a rotary engine for a sports car, that will potentially in some markets be with hybrid drivetrains, but both will have distinct powertrains from Mazda&#x27;s first EV, which will be released in 2019/20. &quot;...some cities will ban combustion, therefore we need some additional portion of electrification because the driver can&#x27;t use this rotary sports car. Some of the regions we don&#x27;t need this small electrification, therefore we can utilise pure rotary engines.&quot;

In 2021, Mazda announced that the upcoming plug-in hybrid variant of the MX-30 would feature a new rotary engine that acts as a range extender to recharge the batteries, but not to power the wheels.

<text>LP &quot;Odyssey&quot; is a self-propelled semi-submersible mobile spacecraft launch platform converted from a mobile drilling rig in 1997.

The vessel was used by Sea Launch for equatorial Pacific Ocean launches. She works in concert with the assembly and control ship . Her home port was at the Port of Long Beach in the United States.

In her current form, &quot;Odyssey&quot; is long and about wide, with an empty draft displacement of , and a submerged draft displacement of . The vessel has accommodations for 68 crew and launch system personnel, including living, dining, medical and recreation facilities. A large environmentally-controlled hangar stores the rocket during transit, from which the rocket is rolled out and erected prior to fueling and launch.

In September 2016 the platform along with other Sea Launch assets was sold to S7 Group, the parent company of S7 Airlines. Since then she has been moved to a port on the east coast of Russia, along with the other ship.

==History==
The platform was completed in 1983 for Ocean Drilling &amp; Exploration Company (ODECO) by Sumitomo Heavy Industries. It drilled its first exploratory hole about south of Yakutat for ARCO Alaska, Inc. The rig cost about to build during the early eighties oil &quot;boom&quot;.

During construction the vessel was called &quot;Ocean Ranger II&quot;, and was renamed &quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; after capsized with all hands lost during a storm off Newfoundland on 15 February 1982.

When built, &quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; was classed +A1 +AMS by the American Bureau of Shipping for unrestricted worldwide ocean service. She was a long, wide, twin-hull design with a propulsion system. The rig&#x27;s structure was designed to simultaneously withstand winds, waves, and a current. The derrick was fully enclosed with a heated drill floor permitting operations down to .

The rig had other advanced extreme-condition features as well. For example, the rig&#x27;s columns were strengthened to withstand some ice impact and the marine riser had a feature similar to a cow-catcher to keep floating ice off the marine riser that connected the rig to the well on the ocean bottom.

===1988 North Sea gas blowout===
On 22 September 1988, &quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; suffered a blowout while operated by ODECO (now Diamond Offshore Drilling) on hire to ARCO (now a subsidiary of BP), drilling the 22/30b-3 well on a prospect in the North Sea. The ultimate direct cause of the incident was a failure of the subsea wellhead equipment after a prolonged period of well control. During the resulting fire the radio operator, Timothy Williams, was killed. He had been ordered from the lifeboats and back to the radio room by the rig&#x27;s manager, who failed to countermand the order when the rig was evacuated.

Survivors were picked up by the rig&#x27;s emergency standby vessel &quot;Notts Forest&quot; (38 rescued) and the nearby anchor handling tug &quot;British Fulmar&quot; (28 rescued). Four Sea King helicopters from and a Sea King from RAF Boulmer assisted rescue operations and transferred survivors from &quot;Notts Forest&quot; and &quot;British Fulmar&quot; to the drilling rig &quot;Sedneth 701&quot;. A Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod provided coordination on scene.

The incident was featured in the 1990 STV television series &quot;Rescue&quot; episode &quot;Missing&quot;.

===Launch platform conversion===
&quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; spent the next several years as a rusting hulk in the docks of Dundee, Scotland. Her availability prompted Boeing to establish the Sea Launch consortium, for which she was bought in 1993 by Kværner Rosenberg of Stavanger, Norway, and renamed LP &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

From late 1995 to May 1997, Kværner extended the length of the platform and added a pair of support columns and additional propulsion systems. The upper deck — the location of the former drill floor — was rebuilt to accommodate the launch pad and launch vehicle service hangar. In May 1997, &quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; arrived at Kværner Vyborg Shipyard for the installation of the launch vehicle equipment itself.

By 1999, the vessel was ready for service, and on 27 March 1999, a Zenit-3SL rocket successfully launched a demonstration satellite to a geostationary transfer orbit. The first commercial launch occurred on 9 October 1999, with the orbiting of the DirecTV 1-R satellite.

===2007 launch failure===
On 30 January 2007, a Zenit-3SL carrying the NSS-8 satellite exploded aboard &quot;Odyssey&quot; at liftoff due to a turbopump malfunction. There were no injuries, as the ship had been evacuated for launch operations. Damage to the launch platform was mostly superficial, though a flame deflector was knocked loose from underneath the platform and lost, along with damage to the hangar doors and antennae. The vessel was repaired at a shipyard in Vancouver, British Columbia.

&quot;Odyssey&quot; returned to service on 15 January 2008, with the successful launch of the Thuraya 3 satellite.

===2013 launch failure===
On 1 February 2013, the Zenit-3SL rocket carrying Intelsat 27 suffered a failure after its launch from &quot;Odyssey&quot;, crashing a short distance from the launch platform. Its first stage engine appeared to shut down around 25 seconds after launch and telemetry from the rocket was lost about 15 seconds later. Telemetry indicated that excessive roll was detected 11 seconds after launch. The guidance system was programmed to shut down the engine, but only after the rocket was safely away from the launch platform. It is believed that a failure in a hydraulic pump that provides power for gimbaling the RD-171 engine was ultimately the cause. The launch platform suffered no damage.

<text>Messier 70 or M70, also known as NGC 6681, is a globular cluster of stars to be found in the south of Sagittarius. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. The famous comet Hale–Bopp was discovered near this cluster in 1995. 

It is about 29,400 light years away from Earth and around from the Galactic Center. It is roughly the same size and luminosity as its neighbour in space, M69. M70 has a very small core radius of and a half-light radius of . This cluster has undergone core collapse, leaving it centrally concentrated with the luminosity distribution following a power law.

There are two distinct stellar populations in the cluster, with each displaying unique abundances. These likely represent different generations of stars. Five known variable stars lie within the broadest radius, the tidal radius, of it, all of which are RR Lyrae variables. The cluster may have two blue stragglers near the core.

<doc id="964756" wikidata="Q2368496" url="?curid=964756" title="Surface Transportation Board">
<text>The Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States is an independent federal agency that serves as an adjudicatory board. The board was created in 1996 following the abolition of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and absorbed regulatory powers relevant to the railroad industry previously under the ICC&#x27;s purview.

The STB has broad economic regulatory oversight of railroads in the United States, including matters related to the construction, acquisition, abandonment of rail lines, railbanking, carrier mergers, and interchange of traffic between carriers and some passenger rail matters.

The board also has jurisdiction over the &quot;intercity bus industry, non-energy pipelines, household goods carriers’ tariffs, and rate regulation of non-contiguous domestic water transportation&quot;. 

The board comprises five members nominated by the President, each subject to Senate confirmation. Since 2024, Democrat Robert E. Primus has served as chair of the STB.

== History ==
The STB was established on January 1, 1996 to assume some of the regulatory functions that had been administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission when the ICC was abolished. Other ICC regulatory functions were either eliminated or transferred to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or the Bureau of Transportation Statistics within the Department of Transportation.

Since its founding, various legislation pertaining to the STB&#x27;s functions has been introduced in Congress. In 2015, the Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act was passed, which expanded the Board from three to five members. The passage of the legislation transformed the STB, which had been &quot;administratively aligned&quot; with the Department of Transportation while still decisionally independent, into an entirely independent federal agency. 

In response to concerns regarding increasing corporate concentration in the rail industry, the STB has considered proposals to encourage rail competition. In 2016, a proposal was made to establish &quot;reciprocal switching rules&quot; to require railroads to create arrangements where shippers could access competing carriers instead of other options. In 2022, Chairman Oberman supported reciprocal switching rules, arguing they would address shippers&#x27; complaints and encourage industry competition.

== Agency authority ==
The STB has the authority to regulate rates, service, construction, acquisition, railbanking and abandonment of rail lines, carrier mergers, and traffic interchanges.

The STB also has oversight of pipeline carriers, intercity bus carriers, moving van companies, trucking companies involved in collective activities, and water carriers engaged in non-contiguous domestic trade. The Board has broad discretion, through its exemption authority from federal, state, and local laws, to implement transportation regulation.

=== Performance and policy goals ===
The Board provides a forum for resolving surface transportation disputes and other matters within its jurisdiction. It has the authority to limit or remove regulatory requirements where appropriate.

==Organizational structure and members==

The Board comprises five members nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates the Board&#x27;s chairman from among the members. As its chief executive, the chairman coordinates and organizes the agency&#x27;s work and acts as its representative in legislative matters and relations with other governmental bodies.

The current chairman is Republican Patrick Fuchs, who was nominated to the STB by President Donald Trump in 2018, confirmed by the Senate, and sworn in in January 2019. Fuchs was chosen by President Donald Trump to serve as chairman of the STB on January 20, 2025, succeeding Robert E. Primus, who had been Chairman between May 2024 and January 2025.

The vice chairman represents the Board and assumes the chairman&#x27;s duties as appropriate. Additionally, the vice chairman oversees matters involving the admission, discipline, and disbarment of non-attorney Board practitioners. The current vice chairman is Karen Hedlund, appointed on January 9, 2023, succeeding Michelle A. Schultz in the board&#x27;s annual rotation of that position.

=== Nominations ===
* Karen J. Hedlund was confirmed on December 16, 2021, as a member of the Board. Hedlund was named vice chair on January 9, 2023.
* Patrick Fuchs was confirmed to the Board on January 2, 2019, by a voice vote in the United States Senate.
* Michelle Schultz and Robert E. Primus were confirmed to two newly created seats on the board on November 18, 2020, both by voice vote. Schultz&#x27;s term runs for five years from the day of entering office. Primus&#x27; term runs until December 31, 2027. Primus was named chair on May 11, 2024.

Assisting the Board in carrying out its responsibilities is a staff of 117 (FY2018) with experience in economics, law, accounting, transportation analysis, finance, and administration.

==Offices==

===Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance===

The Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance is the agency&#x27;s principal point of contact with Congress, state and local governments, the media, industry stakeholders, and the general public. This office includes the Rail Customer and Public Assistance Program, where Board staff solves problems ranging from a simple answer to a telephone inquiry to lengthy informal dispute resolution efforts between railroads and shippers.

===Office of Economics===

The Office of Economics analyzes rate cases, conducts economic and financial analyses of the railroad industry, and audits Class I railroads.

===Office of Environmental Analysis===

The Office of Environmental Analysis is responsible for undertaking environmental reviews of proposed STB actions in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws and making environmental recommendations to the STB.

===Office of the Managing Director===

The Office of the Managing Director handles administrative matters such as personnel, budget, and information technology.

===Office of Proceedings===

The Office of Proceedings (OP) is primarily responsible for developing the public record in formal cases (or proceedings) filed with the STB, making recommendations regarding the resolution of issues presented in those cases, and preparing the decisions issued by the Board.

The Office of Proceedings is a legal office consisting almost entirely of attorneys and paralegal specialists responsible for the majority of the cases at the STB. The office applies the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, as well as the Board&#x27;s regulations. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Office of Proceedings obtains and applies any necessary input from economic, financial, operational, environmental, and other legal staff experts throughout the agency.

The Office of Proceedings includes a clearance unit responsible for tabulating votes on STB cases and recording the official outcome of those votes and a recordations unit that enters data about a filing&#x27;s primary and secondary documents into the STB Recordations database, which is accessible to the public on the STB web site.

===Office of General Counsel===

The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) responds to questions on various legal issues. However, its primary mission is to defend the STB&#x27;s decisions in court and assess the defensibility of agency decisions that might be challenged in court. Unlike most Federal agencies, the STB has independent litigating authority (). Under the Hobbs Act, when an STB order or decision is challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals, both the STB (represented by the agency&#x27;s attorneys) and the United States (represented by U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys) must be named as &quot;respondents&quot; (defendants), and both have authority to appear in court in such cases. STB and DOJ attorneys jointly defend the agency&#x27;s decisions, with the STB&#x27;s attorneys preparing written briefs (in consultation with DOJ attorneys) and presenting oral arguments on behalf of the Federal Government.

In performing defensibility assessments, OGC attorneys meet with other STB staff to discuss cases before draft decisions are prepared. Defensibility assessments are crucial to issuing sound choices that are less likely to be challenged and, if challenged, are more likely to be upheld.

===Office of Passenger Rail (OPR)===
The Office of Passenger Rail supports the Board in its efforts to meet its responsibilities under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. The Office provides the Board with expertise related to passenger rail that includes legal and policy guidance, engineering, data analysis, and rail operations.

<doc id="964757" wikidata="Q3022464" url="?curid=964757" title="Deni Hines">
<text>Dohnyale Sharon &quot;Deni&quot; Hines (born 4 September 1970) is an Australian singer who has been releasing music since the early 1990s, with chart success in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Europe. She is the daughter of American-born Australian singer Marcia Hines.

Hines released her first single with the Australian band Rockmelons with a cover version of the Bill Withers 1971 hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot;. She then went on to release solo material, including the top-five single &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; and the top-20 album &quot;Imagination&quot; (1996), which sold more than 55,000 copies worldwide. A remix album, which included brand-new tracks, became &quot;Remix Your Imagination&quot;. Her third studio album was titled &quot;Water for Chocolate&quot;, which was released on 19 August 2006 and features the singles &quot;Water for Chocolate&quot;, &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; and &quot;5 Days of Rain&quot;.

In 2007, Hines recorded a successful jazz album with Australian jazz artist James Morrison. The pair toured Australia to sold-out shows. In 2012, she played singer Neri Rogers in &quot;The Green Mill Murder&quot;, S1:E3 of &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot;. On 18 November 2016, her fourth studio album, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;, was released, with the lead single &quot;What About Love&quot; co-written by Hines and Edward Said. In 2019, Hines competed on &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; under the alias of Unicorn. She was knocked out in finals week and ended up placing fourth.

==Music career==
===1985–1993: Career launch, The Rockmelons and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;===
Hines was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and was inspired by her mother&#x27;s success as a singer to follow a career in show business. She was discovered by a friend when she was singing to the radio and then was encouraged to pursue singing as a career. Her earliest employment was as a backing vocalist for such artists as Kylie Minogue (her Rhythm of Love Tour, Australia and Far East 1991), Jimmy Barnes, Wa Wa Nee and Peter Blakeley before she was approached by the band Rockmelons to provide vocals for several of their songs. The first song that Hines released with the Rockmelons collaboration was a cover version of the Bill Withers 1970s hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; in 1991. The song proved to be a success, charting at number five on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. With the success of the first single, the reggae-inspired &quot;That Word (L.O.V.E.)&quot; was the second song released with the collaboration and became another top-five single, charting at number four in Australia. The third and final song Hines released with the band was the ballad &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over&quot;. The song was also a success but was not as big as the previous two, charting at number 15 in Australia. With the success with the Rockmelons, Hines became one of the most well-known faces, and voices, in Australia.

In 1992, entrepreneur Harry M. Miller signed Hines for the role of Mary Magdalene in a revival of the stage musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. Miller had discovered and signed her mother Marcia twenty years earlier, and the role of Mary Magdalene had also been one of Marcia&#x27;s early successes. Deni Hines was well received in the role but left the production the following year. In 1992, Hines recorded &quot;Not Enough Time&quot; with INXS, and it peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; a year later, she married the band&#x27;s guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly.

===1994–1999: &quot;Imagination&quot;/&quot;Pay Attention&quot; and &quot;Remix Your Imagination&quot;===
After three hit singles with the Rockmelons, Hines was signed to Mushroom Records and released her first solo single, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, in 1995. The song charted at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and won an ARIA Award for &quot;Breakthrough Artist – Single&quot;. &quot;Imagination&quot; was released at the beginning of 1996 and peaked at number 37. With two songs released from the album, Hines released her debut album &quot;Imagination&quot; on 27 May 1996; it charted at number 15 on the Australia ARIA Albums Chart and was nominated for two ARIA Awards. &quot;I Like the Way&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; (a cover version of a 10cc song) were the album&#x27;s third and fourth singles, but both failed to chart in to top 50 in Australia.

In order to promote her album internationally, Hines moved to the UK in 1997 and reissued her album under the title &quot;Pay Attention&quot; and toured with Lighthouse Family and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; was released in the United Kingdom in 1997 and was received well, peaking at number 35 on the singles chart. The track also managed to peak at number 22 in France. Further hits such as &quot;I Like the Way&quot;, &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Delicious&quot; followed. In 1998, Hines cracked the U.S. market on the dance charts with &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;I Like the Way&quot; both peaking in the top 20 of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. Hines released a remix album titled &quot;Remix Your Imagination&quot;. This album included the song &quot;Dream Your Dream&quot;, which was successful in Japan.

===2000–2007: &quot;A Delicious Collection&quot;, &quot;Water for Chocolate&quot; and &quot;The Other Woman&quot;===
In 2000, Hines did a cover version of the Grace Jones song &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper&quot; the soundtrack for 2000 Australian film &quot;The Wog Boy&quot;. A Soca version of that same song was performed some 18 years later in 2018 by a similarly named Hinds (Alison Hinds &quot;Pull Up&quot; – Barbados Crop Over 2018).

In 2002, Hines released a greatest hits album, &quot;A Delicious Collection&quot;, based on contractual commitments with her then record company, Festival Mushroom. In 2003, she spent time in France working with hip hop artist I:AM, writing and recording for his album in addition to co-writing a track, &quot;Welcome&quot;, on which Beyoncé Knowles sang for I:AM&#x27;s release.

In 2004 and 2005, Hines spent most of the time overseas with her then-fiancé Ben Steel. Hines was writing for a new album in the US with the likes of the Family Stand and Whole 9 and back in Australia with Jarrad Rogers, Vince Pizzinga and many others. In early 2006, Hines played the part of Reno (a composite character representing a number of Dusty Springfield&#x27;s lesbian lovers) in the stage musical &quot;Dusty – The Original Pop Diva&quot;, that premiered in Melbourne before touring Australia until September 2006. &quot;Dusty: The Original Pop Diva&quot; grossed $20M at the Australian box office.

Hines&#x27; single &quot;Water for Chocolate&quot;, written by the Family Stand, was released in Australia on 8 July 2006 and just missed the top 100, peaking at number 28 on the Australian Urban Singles Chart. The song was followed up by an album of the same name released on 19 August 2006. Two further singles, &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; and &quot;5 Days of Rain&quot;, were released in 2007.

In 2007, she collaborated with trumpeter James Morrison on an album of jazz standards, &quot;The Other Woman&quot;. Hines and Morrison performed an Australian National Theatre tour to near sell out audiences and received an ARIA nomination for &quot;Best Jazz Album&quot;. They also performed at marquee festivals such as the Christchurch Jazz Festival and the Darling Harbour Jazz Festival.

===2008–2013: Film, television and theatre work===
In 2008, she teamed up with Christine Anu for the charity single &quot;Takin&#x27; it to The Street&quot;. In February 2009 a live DVD with bonus audio disc was released, taken for their two national tours.

In mid-2008, Hines received a call from Oscar-nominated film director Bruce Beresford and agreed to play a small role in &quot;Mao&#x27;s Last Dancer&quot;. The film was released on 1 October 2009.

In 9 October, Hines became the ambassador for the humanitarian charity Oasis Africa Australia, where she visited the foundation&#x27;s village and school in Kibera, Kenya, in January 2010. While there, Hines commenced recording a world music–style album featuring some of the local musicians and the children&#x27;s choir from the Oasis Africa School.

July 2010 saw Hines reunite with Tamsin Carroll, from &quot;Dusty – The Original Pop Diva&quot;, to perform a series of shows called Dusty the Concert; it featured over 20 hits. There were 16 shows.

On 9 July 2011, Hines released a new single, &quot;Finger on the Trigger&quot;, a Donna Summer classic. Produced by Rob Taylor and DJ Alex Taylor, its uptempo funky feel failed to get dance floors moving and bombed on the charts.

From October 2011, Hines featured in &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot;. She was fired after task 3, in which her team raised $47,400 for Oasis Africa Australia, but returned for the final episodes on Team Unity.

Hines played the role of Nerine Rogers in the third episode of Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries, which aired in March 2012.

On 31 July 2012, Hines became engaged to Daniel Moses, a Sydney-based financier. They were married on 23 December 2012 in Sydney.

===2014–present: &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;===
Throughout 2013 and 2014, Hines performed the &#x27;Café Soul Sessions&#x27; tour around Australia, and the idea for a soul-inspired album was born. &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; was available for download only from her website from December 2014. On 18 November 2016, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; was released digitally and physically, with the lead single &quot;What About Love&quot;, an original track co-written by Hines and Edward Said. The album also includes two other Hines co-writes, with &quot;I Got Your Back&quot; and &quot;Runnin&#x27;&quot;.

==Personal life==
In an interview, Hines stated that her father &quot;had Somalian and Ethiopian in him&quot;.

In December 1993, Hines married INXS musician Kirk Pengilly. The marriage lasted 10 months and they parted ways in early 1995.

Hines married her boyfriend of 18 months, businessman and sometime-musician Daniel Moses, at Sergeant&#x27;s Mess in Middle Head, overlooking Sydney Harbour National Park, in 2012.

<text>Messier 71 (also known as M71, NGC 6838, or the Angelfish Cluster) is a globular cluster in the small northern constellation Sagitta. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of non-comet-like objects in 1780. It was also noted by Koehler at Dresden around 1775. Messier 71 is also known as NGC 6839 and The Bernardo Star, though this identification is very uncertain. 

This star cluster is about 13,000 light years away from Earth and spans . The irregular variable star &quot;Z Sagittae&quot; is a member.

M71 was for many decades thought (until the 1970s) to be a densely packed open cluster and was classified as such by leading astronomers in the field of star cluster research due to its lacking a dense central compression, and to its stars having more &quot;metals&quot; than is usual for an ancient globular cluster; furthermore, it lacks the RR Lyrae &quot;cluster&quot; variable stars that are common in most globulars. However, modern photometric photometry has detected a short &quot;horizontal branch&quot; in the H-R diagram (chart of temperature versus luminosity) which is characteristic of a globular cluster. The shortness of the branch explains the lack of RR Lyrae variables and is due to the globular&#x27;s relatively young age of 9–10 billion years. Taking in many or only late series (Population I) stars explains relatively its stars. Hence today M71 is designated as a very loosely concentrated globular cluster, much like M68 in Hydra. M71 has a mass of about and a luminosity of around 19,000 .

<doc id="964767" wikidata="Q2915711" url="?curid=964767" title="Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)">
<text>Bobov (or Bobover Hasidism) (, ) is a Hasidic community within Haredi Judaism, originating in Bobowa, Galicia, in southern Poland, and now headquartered in the neighborhood of Borough Park, in Brooklyn, New York.

Bobov developed into a leading Hasidic dynasty through the leadership of Shlomo Halberstam, a Holocaust survivor. After the death of his son Naftali, a succession crisis ensued, leading to the ascension of Naftali&#x27;s half-brother Benzion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam as Grand Rebbe, and his son-in-law Mordechai Dovid Unger as leader of , a breakaway faction.

Bobov communities are found in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn; in Monsey, New York; Los Angeles; Lakewood, New Jersey; Linden NJ; Montreal; Toronto; Antwerp; and London. In Israel, Bobov has large branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Ashdod, Elad, Beitar Illit, and an enclave, &quot;Kiryas Bobov&quot;, in Bat Yam.

==Outline of Bobov&#x27;s Hasidic rabbinical lineage==














==History==
===First Rebbe of Bobov, Shlomo Halberstam (1847 – 1905)===
Bobov originated with Shlomo Halberstam, who was the grandson of Grand Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz, in the Galician village of Bobowa.

While most of the early yeshivos (Talmudical academies) originated in Lithuania, the 19th century saw the opening of similar institutions in Poland. The first yeshiva in Poland was established by the first Bobover Rebbe in 1881 in Vishnitsa, where he was rabbi then; and it later moved with him to Bobov.

===Second Bobover Rebbe, Benzion Halberstam (1874 – 1941)===
His work was continued by his son, Grand Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam, author of &quot;Kedushas Tzion&quot;. The Bobov Yeshiva was originally situated only in the town of Bobov itself. However, under his guidance, the court grew in numbers, with Hasidic youth flocking to Bobov. Subsequently, as many as sixty branches of the yeshiva under the name Etz Chaim were established throughout Galicia.

During World War II, the Bobov Hasidic movement was destroyed. The second Rebbe himself was murdered in the Holocaust, together with family members and thousands of his followers.

===Third Bobover Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam (1908 – 2000)===
Barely 300 Hasidim survived, and the Rebbe&#x27;s son, Shlomo Halberstam, took it upon himself to rebuild Bobov. He first settled in the West Side of Manhattan, later moving to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The yeshiva, which was originally located at 184 Brooklyn Avenue, later moved to the nearby Borough Park neighborhood. Shlomo Halberstam was known for his wisdom, his caring for others, and his steadfastness in not taking sides in disputes. 

Over the more than fifty years that Shlomo Halberstam was Rebbe of Bobov, he founded and built a worldwide network of synagogues, Hasidic schools for boys and girls, &quot;mesivtas&quot; (high schools), and post-high school houses of learning. Besides schools, a summer camp for boys was founded in 1957 in Ferndale, New York, and a girls camp, Camp Gila, was founded a few years later. At the time of his death in August 2000, he was mourned by more followers than his father had in pre-war Poland. At his funeral it was publicly announced that his oldest son Naftali would succeed him as Rebbe, and his younger brother Ben Zion would serve as &quot;Rav Hatzair&quot; (assistant rabbi).

===Fourth Bobover Rebbe, Naftali Halberstam (1931 – 2005)===
With Shlomo Halberstam&#x27;s death, his older son, Naftali Zvi Halberstam, succeeded him. Naftali Zvi died on March 23, 2005 (12th of Adar II, 5765), at age 74, leaving a wife, two daughters, and two sons-in-law: Yehoshua Rubin, Rav of Bobov-45; and Mordechai Dovid Unger, Rebbe of Bobov-45.

===Fifth and current Rebbe of Bobov, Ben Zion Halberstam (1955 –)===
After Naftali Tzvi Halberstam died in 2005, a dispute arose among Bobover Hasidim as to who should attain the dynasty leadership. Some began to follow Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, the younger brother of the late Rebbe, while others followed his son-in-law Unger, who was older by one year. Unger had already ensconced himself firmly within the community by then, and could not challenge his own father&#x27;s leadership of Dombrov, which anyway was not as substantial a dynasty. The matter of succession was brought before a beth din (religious court) in 2007, which ruled that Halberstam would be declared the fifth Rebbe of Bobov () with its headquarters on 48th Street in Borough Park, while Unger would be Rebbe of Bobov-45 (), located on 45th Street. While the former community retained the rights to the name &quot;Bobov&quot;, Unger&#x27;s faction was permitted to use the name, provided that the qualifier be added to it.

==Bobov-45==
An offshoot of the Bobov dynasty, Bobov-45 is headquartered in Borough Park. It has branches in Williamsburg and Monsey, New York; Lakewood, New Jersey; Los Angeles; Montreal; London; Manchester; Antwerp; and an enclave &quot;Yishuv of Chasidei Bobov-45&quot; in Union, New Jersey. In Israel, Bobov-45 has branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Beit Shemesh, Ashdod, Elad, and Beitar Illit.

===History of Bobov-45===
The third Bobover Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam, rebuilt the Bobov Hasidic dynasty in the United States after losing his wife and most of his children in the Holocaust. His son Naftali, who survived, became the fourth Rebbe upon his father&#x27;s death. He had no sons but left two daughters, one of whom married Yehoshua Rubin, and the other Mordechai Dovid Unger. In 2005, after Naftali&#x27;s death, a group of Bobover Hasidim loyal to his son-in-law, Mordechai Dovid Unger, preferred him to take over the position of Rebbe of Bobov.

The dispute was taken to a &quot;beth din&quot; (arbitration panel), which ruled that Halberstam held the rights to the name &quot;Bobov&quot;, and to all Bobov institutions. 
Unger was allowed to use the name Bobov, provided that a qualifier be added to it. The suffix &quot;-45&quot; was henceforth adopted in tribute to the street on which the community center of the sect was located at the time. In addition, the &quot;beth din&quot; ordered Bobov to pay $6,200,000 to Bobov-45&#x27;s Rebbe and &quot;dayan&quot; in twenty-five quarterly installments, as an allotment of their faction&#x27;s share of the inheritance of the Bobov enterprise&#x27;s assets, it is unknown what the value of the assets were at the time.

===First and current Grand rabbi of Bobov-45 Mordechai Dovid Unger (1954 –)===
Unger, the first Grand Rabbi of Bobov-45, is the younger son-in-law of the fourth Bobover Rebbe, Naftali Halberstam. Unger has been active in the wider Jewish community. Yehoshua Rubin, the older son-in-law of Halberstam, is the current &quot;dayan&quot; and rabbinical leader of the sect.

===Institutions===
Community institutions, such as a synagogue, have been built within Bobov-45. 
Other Bobov infrastructure includes 
a Yeshiva,
beth midrash (study hall), 
&quot;cheder&quot; (elementary school), 
yeshiva ketana (secondary school), 
&quot;mesivta&quot;, 
girls school, 
day camp, 
and wedding halls.

<text>Messier 74 (also known as NGC 628 and Phantom Galaxy) is a large spiral galaxy in the equatorial constellation Pisces. It is about 32 million light-years away from Earth. The galaxy contains two clearly defined spiral arms and is therefore used as an archetypal example of a grand design spiral galaxy. The galaxy&#x27;s low surface brightness makes it the most difficult Messier object for amateur astronomers to observe. Its relatively large angular (that is, apparent) size and the galaxy&#x27;s face-on orientation make it an ideal object for professional astronomers who want to study spiral arm structure and spiral density waves. It is estimated that M74 hosts about 100 billion stars.

==Observation history==
M74 was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1780. He then communicated his discovery to Charles Messier, who listed the galaxy in his catalog. In July 2022, it was observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.

==Structure==
M74 has two spiral arms that wind counterclockwise from the galaxy&#x27;s center. The spiral arms widen as they get farther from M74&#x27;s center, but one of the arms narrows at the end. The arms deviate slightly from a constant angle.

==Supernovae==
Three supernovae are known to have taken place within it: SN 2002ap, SN 2003gd, and SN 2013ej (the numbers denote the year). The latter was bright as 10th magnitude when viewed from the surface of Earth, so visible from almost all modern telescopes in a good night sky.

SN 2002ap was one of few Type Ic supernovae (which denotes hypernovae) recorded within 10 Mpc every century. This explosion has been used to test theories on the origins of others further away and theories on the emission by supernovae of gamma ray bursts.

SN 2003gd is a Type II-P supernova. Type II supernovae have known luminosities, so they can be used to accurately measure distances. The distance measured to M74 using SN 2003gd is 9.6 ± 2.8 Mpc, or 31 ± 9 million ly. For comparison, distances measured using the brightest supergiants are 7.7 ± 1.7 Mpc and 9.6 ± 2.2 Mpc. Ben Sugerman found a &quot;light echo&quot; – a later reflection of the explosion – associated with SN 2003gd. This is one of the few supernovae in which such a reflection has been found. This reflection appears to be from dust in a sheet-like cloud that lies in front of the supernova, and it can be used to determine the composition of the interstellar dust.

In addition to these supernovae, the astronomical transient AT 2019krl was discovered on 6 July 2019 and classified as either a type IIn supernova or an LBV in outburst. Later analysis argued that it was consistent with known examples of giant LBV eruptions and SN 2008S-like objects.

==Galaxy group==
This is the brightest member of the M74 Group, a group of 5 to 7 galaxies that also includes the peculiar spiral galaxy NGC 660 and a few irregular galaxies. Different group membership identification methods (ranging from a clear, to likely, to perhaps historic gravitational tie) identify several objects of the group in common, and a few galaxies whose exact status within such groupings is currently uncertain. 

==Suspected black hole==
In 2005 the Chandra X-ray Observatory announced its observation of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in M74, radiating more X-ray power than a neutron star, in periodic intervals of around two hours. It has an estimated mass of . This is an indicator of an intermediate-mass black hole. This would be a rather uncommon class, in between in size of stellar black holes and the massive black holes theorized to be in the center of many galaxies. Such an object is believed to form from lesser (&quot;stellar&quot;) black holes within a star cluster. The source has been given identification number CXOU J013651.1+154547.

==Amateur astronomy observation==
Messier 74 is 1.5° east-northeast of Eta Piscium. This galaxy has the second-lowest Earth-surface brightness of any Messier object. (M101 has the lowest.) It requires a good night sky. This galaxy may be best viewed under low magnification; when highly magnified, the diffuse emission becomes more extended and appears too faint to be seen by many people. Additionally, M74 may be more easily seen when using averted vision when the eyes are fully dark adapted.

<doc id="964778" wikidata="Q2558835" url="?curid=964778" title="Christ the King">
<text>Christ the King is a title of Jesus in Christianity referring to the idea of the Kingdom of God where Christ is described as being seated at the right hand of God.

Many Christian denominations consider the kingly office of Christ to be one of the threefold offices: Christ is a prophet, priest, and king.

The title &quot;Christ the King&quot; is also frequently used as a name for churches, schools, seminaries, hospitals, and religious institutes.

According to a tradition followed most prominently by the Catholic Church, Mary is given the title of Queen of Heaven.

==Biblical basis==
In the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel proclaims to Mary, &quot;Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&quot;

In the Book of Revelation (17:14) it is declared that the Lamb is &quot;King of kings, and Lord of lords&quot;.

==Background==
The concept of Christ as king was the subject of an address given by Eusebius about AD 314. Depictions of the imperial Christ arise in the later part of the fourth century. Christ Pantokrator (&quot;Ruler of All&quot;) is one of the most common religious icons of Orthodox Christianity. The Western equivalent is Christ in Majesty.

==Pius XI==
===&quot;Ubi arcano Dei consilio&quot;===
Pope Pius XI&#x27;s first encyclical was &quot;Ubi arcano Dei consilio&quot; of December 1922. Writing in the aftermath of World War I, Pius noted that while there had been a cessation of hostilities, there was no true peace. He deplored the rise of class divisions and unbridled nationalism, and held that true peace can only be found under the Kingship of Christ as &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;. &quot;For Jesus Christ reigns over the minds of individuals by his teachings, in their hearts by His love, in each one&#x27;s life by the living according to His law and the imitating of His example.&quot;

===&quot;Quas primas&quot;=== 
Christ&#x27;s kingship was addressed again in the encyclical &quot;Quas primas&quot; of Pope Pius XI, published in 1925. Michael D. Greaney called it &quot;possibly one of the most misunderstood and ignored encyclicals of all time.&quot; The pontiff&#x27;s encyclical quotes with approval Cyril of Alexandria, noting that Jesus&#x27;s kingship was given to him by the Father, and was not obtained by violence: &quot;&#x27;Christ,&#x27; he says, &#x27;has dominion over all creatures, a dominion not seized by violence nor usurped, but his by essence and by nature.&#x27;&quot; He also referenced Leo XIII&#x27;s 1899 Annum sacrum wherein Leo relates the Kingship of Christ to devotion to his Sacred Heart.

===Early Propagation===

In November 1926, the Pontiff gave his assent to the establishment of the first church dedicated to Christ under the title of &quot;King&quot;. The Church of Our Lord, Christ the King, a young parish in the neighborhood of Mount Lookout, Cincinnati, which had previously been operating out of a pharmacy located in the neighborhood square, soon began to flourish. In May 1927, a proper sanctuary and neighborhood icon was consecrated. Designed by famed church architect Edward J. Schulte, the building exemplifies the designer&#x27;s signature marriage of art deco decoration in Brutalist construction, principally arranged to mimic Ancient liturgical spaces of early Christianity.

===Feast of Christ the King===

The Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe was instituted by Pope Pius XI in 1925. The General Roman Calendar of 1969 moved its observance in the Roman Rite to the last Sunday of Ordinary Time, the final Sunday of the liturgical year. Most Anglicans, Lutherans and some Protestants celebrate it on the same day. However, Catholics who observe the pre-Vatican II General Roman Calendar of 1960, and members of the Anglican Catholic Church celebrate it instead on the last Sunday of October, the Sunday before All Saints&#x27; Day, the day assigned in 1925.

<text>The Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and Administration (OEEAA) is a part of the Surface Transportation Board of the United States Department of Transportation, a United States government agency. It does work related to railroads.

The OEEAA is responsible for the economic, cost, financial, engineering, and environmental analyses in cases before the Surface Transportation Board (STB). It also provides the administrative support for the STB, including managing buildings and office space and human relations management, and computer systems support.

The OEEAA has a staff of 55 professionals, including varied vocations such as: economists, accountants, financial analysts, engineers, transportation industry analysts, environmental protection specialists, attorneys, computer programmers, personnel specialists, and a variety of administrative support staff. The primary activities and responsibilities of the OEEAA are identified and briefly discussed below.

==Economic Analysis==
OEEAA supports the STB&#x27;s decision making process through economic, cost, financial, and engineering analyses. Typically, the types of cases that they are involved in include: railroad maximum rate proceedings, rail mergers, abandonments, rail line construction, and trackage rights matters. The OEEAA can provide economic and cost information for individual railroads by means of these analyses.

OEEAA also collects and maintains databases, including the rail waybill file as well as annual and quarterly financial and operating data for rail carriers. The OEEAA also maintains the annual Uniform Rail Cost System estimate (URCS), which is the STB&#x27;s general purpose costing system used for various purposes (such as the development and calculation of branch costs)

==Section of Environmental Analysis==
The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) is the office within the Board responsible for directing the environmental review process It conducts independent analysis of all environmental data and makes environmental recommendations to the Board, as well as giving technical advice.

Under the terms of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Board must take into account in its decision making, the impact of its actions upon Earth&#x27;s environment - including direct, indirect and cumulative effects. The STB must consider these effects before making its final decision in a case. SEA assists the STB in meeting this responsibility.

==Administration==
The administrative side of OEEAA provides a wide range of support to STB staff including:-
* Facilities management (including stationery and copier services, emergency planning and equipment supply). 
* Financial management services (including submission and oversight of the STB&#x27;s annual budget, spending plans, payroll program, and user fee collection systems). 
* Human resources support (including hiring new employees, promotions, retirements, staff training issues, grievances, etc.).

<doc id="964784" wikidata="Q1588578" url="?curid=964784" title="Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village">
<text>Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village ( ), colloquially known as StuyTown, is a large post–World War II private residential development on the east side of the New York City borough of Manhattan. The complex consists of 110 red brick apartment buildings on an tract stretching from First Avenue to Avenue C, between 14th and 23rd Streets. Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village is split up into two parts: Stuyvesant Town, south of 20th Street, and Peter Cooper Village, north of 20th Street. Together, the two developments contain 11,250 apartments.

Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village was planned, beginning in 1942, and opened its first building in 1947. It replaced a neighborhood known as the Gas House district. The complex has been sold multiple times, most recently in 2015 when it was sold to Ivanhoé Cambridge and Blackstone for $5.45 billion.

Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village is part of Manhattan Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10009 and 10010. It is patrolled by the 13th Precinct of the New York City Police Department (NYPD).

==Geography==
Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village is bounded by First Avenue on the west, 23rd Street on the north, Avenue C on the east, and 14th Street on the south. The complex covers about of land in total, including parkland. Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village contains 11,250 apartments in 55 buildings, which have 110 separate street addresses.

The buildings south of 20th Street are known as Stuyvesant Town, or &quot;Stuy Town&quot;. They were named after Peter Stuyvesant, the last director-general of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, whose farm occupied the site in the 17th century. The buildings north of 20th Street are called Peter Cooper Village, named after the 19th-century industrialist, inventor and philanthropist Peter Cooper, who founded Cooper Union.

Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village abuts the Stuyvesant Park and Gramercy Park neighborhoods on the west, the East Village and Alphabet City to the south, and Kips Bay to the north. The surrounding area to the west is notable for a historic two-block park surrounded by the old Stuyvesant High School called Stuyvesant Square, Saint George&#x27;s Church, and the Beth Israel Medical Center.

==History==
===Gas House District===
In 1842, one gas storage tank at East 23rd Street and the river was erected, quickly followed by the construction of other gas tanks, and by the late 19th century, the site of the complex had become known as the &quot;Gashouse District&quot; because of the many gas storage tanks owned by Consolidated Gas Company that dominated the streetscapes. The tanks, which sometimes leaked, made the area undesirable to live in, as did the Gas House Gang and other predators who operated in the area.

The population was predominantly poor, at first largely Irish, and then Germans and Jews. Later, Slovaks and other Eastern Europeans were the dominant ethnic groups, including a large population of Armenians who lived in the upper Twenties between First and Lexington avenues.

Crime in the district was endemic. When Alexander S. Williams was promoted to police captain on May 31, 1872, and assigned to the area, he met the gangs&#x27; violence with equal force of his own, putting together a brute squad that beat up gangsters with clubs. He commented: &quot;There is more law at the end of a policeman&#x27;s nightstick than in a decision of the Supreme Court.&quot;

With the construction of the FDR Drive, the area began to improve. By the 1930s, all but four tanks were gone, and, while shabby, the area was no more blighted than many parts of the city after the years of the Great Depression.

Before the construction of Stuyvesant Town, the neighborhood contained 18 city blocks, with public schools, churches, factories, private homes, apartments, small businesses and even relatively new modern-style apartment buildings. In all, 600 buildings, containing 3,100 families, 500 stores and small factories, three churches, three schools, and two theaters, were razed. As would be repeated in later urban renewal projects, some 11,000 persons were forced to move from the neighborhood. In 1945, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the move from the site &quot;the greatest and most significant mass movement of families in New York&#x27;s history.&quot; The last residents of the Gas House district, the Delman family, moved out in May 1946, allowing demolition to be completed shortly thereafter.

===Planning===
Due to a New York City housing shortage that had been growing since the Depression, Stuyvesant Town was already being planned as a post-war housing project in 1942–43, some years before the end of World War II. A provision was made that the rental applications of veterans would have selection priority. The complex was developed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and was based on its earlier development in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx, which was completed in 1942. The same companies and developers also built Riverton, which was completed around the same time.

In January 1945, Metropolitan Life mapped out its post-war plans for 6,000 residents of Peter Cooper Village, which would stretch east of First Avenue, between 20th and 22nd streets, while efforts were made to acquire land north of 22nd Street. The project would be an extension of the previously announced Stuyvesant Town.

Metropolitan Life president Frederick H. Ecker said of Stuyvesant Town in its initial offering that it would make it possible for generations of New Yorkers &quot;to live in a park – to live in the country in the heart of New York.&quot; On the first day the company received 7,000 applications; it would receive 100,000 applicants by the time of first occupancy. The complex&#x27;s first tenants, two World War II veterans and their families, moved into the first completed building on August 1, 1947. In 1947, rents ranged from $50 to $91 per month. Current rents range from $3,300 for a one bedroom apartment to the $9,000, 5 bedroom unit (there is only one in the complex.)

====Controversy====
Stuyvesant Town was controversial from the beginning. In 1943, the National Association of Housing Officials described the fight as &quot;a battle up to now lacking only in beer bottles and murder.&quot; Although nominally a private development, it was championed by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, who has been called the &quot;dominant force in [the] creation&quot; of both Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. At the behest of Mayor LaGuardia, Moses sought &quot;to induce insurance companies and savings banks to enter the field of large-scale slum clearance.&quot; It was enabled by various state laws and amendments which permitted private companies to enter what was previously a public field of action.


The new public-private partnership, and the contract entered between the city and the developer, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, were the source of much debate. Among the issues at stake were use of the power of eminent domain for private purposes; the reversion of public streets and land, such as public school property, to private ownership; the 25-year tax exemption granted by the contract; and the lack of any restrictions on the company prohibiting discrimination in selecting tenants.

When the $50 million Stuyvesant Town plan was approved by the City Planning Commission on May 20, 1943, by a five to one vote, discrimination against African-Americans was already a significant topic of debate. Councilmen Stanley M. Isaacs and Benjamin J. Davis Jr. sought to introduce a provision into the contract that would prevent racial or religious discrimination in tenant selection. This provision was not accepted; those who rejected it, including Robert Moses, argued that the company&#x27;s profitability would be harmed, and that opponents were &quot;obviously looking for a political issue and not for results in the form of actual slum clearance.&quot;

In the years after it opened, black people were barred from living in the complex. Metropolitan Life&#x27;s president, Frederick H. Ecker, stated that &quot;negroes and whites do not mix&quot;. He also believed that integrating Stuyvesant Town would depress demand for, and hence valuation of, other real estate in the area.

Lee Lorch, a City College of New York professor, petitioned to allow African Americans into the development, and was fired from his teaching position as a result of pressure from Metropolitan Life. Upon accepting a position at Pennsylvania State University, Lorch allowed a black family to occupy his apartment, thus circumventing the &#x27;no Negroes&#x27; rule. As a result of pressure from Metropolitan Life, he was dismissed from his new position as well.

Lawsuits were filed on the basis that the project was public or semi-public, and thus violated anti-discrimination laws for New York City public housing. In July 1947, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that the development was private and that, in the absence of laws to the contrary, the company could discriminate as it saw fit. The judge wrote, &quot;It is well settled that the landlord of a private apartment or dwelling house may, without violating any provision of the Federal or State Constitutions, select tenants of its own choice because of race, color, creed or religion... Clearly, housing accommodation is not a recognized civil right.&quot;

By this date, Metropolitan Life was building the Riverton Houses, a separate-but-equal housing project in Harlem with residents who were mainly black. Some years later, the company admitted a few black families to Stuyvesant Town and a few white families to Riverton. Both projects, however, remain largely segregated.

A host of other issues and controversies surrounded Stuyvesant Town&#x27;s planning and design. From the outset, objections were made to the haste with which the project was approved and lack of public participation in the process; the project&#x27;s population density; the absence of any public facilities such as schools, community centers, or shops in the development; the gated-community, private property character of the complex, and the denial of city residents of the right to walk through a part of the city that was once public; and violations of the city&#x27;s master plan. Lawsuits were brought by property owners of the land, but in February 1944 the Supreme Court of the United States refused to review the constitutionality of the New York State law that enabled the development, despite the taking of public property for private profit, the granting of tax exemptions, and the public benefits advanced by the developers and their advocates.

The complex contained original plaques honoring Frederick H. Ecker and marking the complexes as housing for moderate-income families, which were dedicated during the complexes&#x27; opening day in 1947. In 2002, when the property went luxury market rate, the plaques were removed.

In October 2006, MetLife agreed to sell the complex to Tishman Speyer Properties and the real estate arm of BlackRock for $5.4 billion. The sale was expected to close by November 15, 2006, according to documents which CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate broker representing MetLife, sent to bidders. MetLife hired a broker, who started registering bidders, and intended to name a winner by November 2006. The sale had drawn interest from dozens of prospective buyers, including New York&#x27;s top real estate families, pension funds, international investment banks and investors from Dubai, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, citing real estate executives.

New York City Council member Daniel Garodnick, a lifelong resident of Peter Cooper Village, attempted to organize tenants and investors to place a buyout bid on the complex. Initially, MetLife deemed the tenants group an unqualified bidder, but, after being pressured by elected officials, the company reversed its position, and distributed bid books to the tenant group; bids were to have been submitted by October 5, 2006. Bids included the tenants&#x27; $4.6 billion offer, a bid by Vornado Realty Trust, a joint offer between Lehman Brothers and The Related Companies, and one by Apollo Global Management which came within $100 million of Speyer&#x27;s $5.4 billion. Tishman Speyer paid just $56 million in cash for the property while raising $4 billion in debt from Wachovia and another $500 million from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.

On January 22, 2007, a class action lawsuit was filed against MetLife, Tishman Speyer Properties, and their associates on behalf of the market rate tenants of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The suit claimed that MetLife was improperly charging tenants &quot;market rate&quot; rents while at the same time receiving real estate tax benefits from the City of New York under the J-51 program, which requires property owners to maintain apartments as rent-stabilized during the period in which they are receiving benefits. The lawsuit asked for a monetary award of between $215 million and $320 million in rent overcharges and damages. Furthermore, it called for the market rate apartments to revert to rent stabilization until the expiration of the J-51 benefit period, sometime after 2017.

====2010 default====
In January 2010, Tishman Speyer Properties defaulted on the mortgage, the largest commercial mortgage default in U.S. history. On January 24, 2010, Tishman Speyer Properties gave up control of the properties by handing the complex to creditors, thereby avoiding a bankruptcy of the site. The default was predicted many months in advance; Fitch ratings downgraded the associated CMBS in August 2009. As of January 2010, the complex was estimated to be worth around $1.9 billion or less than 40 percent of the $5.4 billion the property was purchased for in 2006.

While the legal battle over rent stabilization played a small role in the demise, it is likely Tishman Speyer would have defaulted even had it won the case. The assumptions underlying the $5.4 billion 2006 valuation were extremely aggressive; the valuation assumed that the income from the properties would triple by 2011. The landmark sale and default are the subject of the 2013 book &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money: Inside the Housing Crisis and the Demise of the Greatest Real Estate Deal Ever Made&quot; by &quot;New York Times&quot; real estate reporter Charles V. Bagli, who covered Stuyvesant Town for the newspaper.

====2015 sale====

, the property was set to be sold to Blackstone Group LP and Ivanhoé Cambridge, the real-estate arm of pension-fund giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec for about $5.3 billion. Blackstone had recently raised a $15.8 billion fund, the largest real-estate fund ever. New York City was expected to contribute $225 million to help preserve a portion of the complex as affordable to low- and middle-income residents. Under a binding agreement with the city, Blackstone agreed to keep roughly 5,000 units below market rents until at least 2035.

Most of those units would be aimed at what the developers and the city classify as &quot;middle income&quot; families: two-bedroom apartments, for example, would rent for about $3,200 a month, a rent considered affordable for a family of three making up to $128,000 a year, though the median household income in New York City as of the 2011-2015 American Community Survey was $53,373. About 500 units would be set aside for lower-income families, with two-bedroom units renting for up to $1,500 a month. The Federal National Mortgage Association would be providing Blackstone with a $2.7 billion loan through Wells Fargo Multifamily Capital, and the debt would have a term of 10 years.

The $5.45 billion sale was completed in December 2015. SL Green had threatened to file a lawsuit to block the sale, but was paid $10 million to drop its suit.

Growing rents and a gradual conversion of more rent-regulated units to market rates brought the net operating income of the property up each year from 2006 - 2015. At the end of 2015, about 45% of the complex&#x27;s residents were paying regulated rents – down from 71% in 2006 – and income was above $200 million a year. As of January 2023, 6,200 units were rent regulated.

==Architecture==
The complex is designed as two large &quot;superblocks&quot;, independent of the grid system that characterizes the majority of Manhattan below 155th Street. It consists of two large parks, one for each part of the complex, juxtaposed with modern red brick apartment towers. Its design was heavily influenced by the modernist &quot;Towers in the park&quot; theory advocated by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier in which residences consist of tall apartment buildings situated within a park-like environment.

Solar panels were installed atop Stuyvesant Town&#x27;s towers in a project completed in 2019. They comprise the largest array of solar panels on an apartment complex in the United States.

<doc id="964789" wikidata="Q7816314" url="?curid=964789" title="Tom Jakobek">
<text>Tom Jakobek (born ) is a former member of the Toronto City Council. He was first elected to council in 1982 after first serving as a school trustee since 1980. He remained a city councillor until 2000.

==Background==

Jakobek&#x27;s father emigrated to Canada from Poland. He grew up in The Beaches neighborhood of Toronto.

In high school Jakobek was forced to represent his class in the Student Council, a job no one wanted, as a punishment for talking too much in class. He then served as Student Council President for three years.

Following high school, Jakobek attended the University of Toronto, intending to become a teacher and graduating with a degree in public administration. Jakobek would later return to the university to earn a master&#x27;s degree in Health Sciences in 2000.

Jakobek is the son-in-law of former veteran Scarborough councillor Ken Morrish.

==Politics==
While still in college, at age 20 his former librarian arranged a meeting between him and two school trustees, who encouraged him to run for the position himself. In 1980, having spent $13,000 to campaign for a job which paid $7,200/year, the 21 year old Jakobek was elected as a Toronto District School Board, the youngest public school board trustee in the history of Ontario. During the time he represented the district on the School Board, he attended college and worked at a liquor store to pay off his campaign debts and tuition. He gained attention for his support for a bylaw which would have prohibited video games near schools.

Upon graduation from Toronto, Jakobek was accepted into teacher&#x27;s college, but former City Councillor Fred Beavis convinced him to run for City Council, and he obtained a deferment of his acceptance to teacher&#x27;s college to campaign for the office. In the 1982 Toronto municipal election, he was elected as a Metro Toronto Councillor representing the Beaches, becoming at age 23 the youngest Metro Councillor in Toronto history.

He was for many years a bulwark of the council&#x27;s right-wing. He became city of Toronto budget chief in 1990, and held the position for the next ten years despite an attempt by Barbara Hall and others to oust him in 1994. In this capacity, he delivered nine consecutive budgets with no tax increases. Following the city&#x27;s amalgamation in 1997, Jakobek emerged as a prominent ally of new mayor Mel Lastman.

After departing from the City Council, Jakobek took a break from politics to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in Health Sciences at the University of Toronto. During his studies he worked for Toronto East General Hospital where he oversaw its economic development initiative. Earning his degree in 2000, Jakobek left the hospital to run his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s company Romlek Enterprises.

===Campaign for mayor===

Following Mel Lastman’s retirement, Jakobek decided to run for mayor in Toronto&#x27;s 2003 municipal election. The election was won by David Miller, with Jakobek placing fifth. Jakobek&#x27;s campaign was harmed by the Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry, an investigation initiated by the Toronto City Council in 2002 to evaluate a relationship between Jakobek and MFP Financial Services, a company which leased computers to the City of Toronto. Jakobek&#x27;s eventual admission that he had lied about accepting gifts from MFP lobbyists was widely reported as part of the investigation. Partly as a result, Jakobek ended up receiving less than 1% of the vote in the 2003 election.

In March 2010, following a four-year investigation, the Ontario Provincial Police announced that no charges would be filed in relation to the inquiry. However, its existence during the campaign prevented Jakobek from receiving endorsements from key players including the Toronto Police Association.

At the center of Jakobek&#x27;s platform was a proposal to pay off Toronto&#x27;s then $2 billion debt by selling city-owned parking lots, golf courses and unused municipal buildings. An envisioned Summer Work Plan would hire 10,000 teenagers to clean the city while helping them pay for college education. Similarly, a Financial Aid Pilot Program would help immigrants with experience in health care to pay for recertification in Canada under the theory that the resulting increases in tax revenue would cover the costs of the program.

==Leuty Lifeguard Station==

The Leuty Lifeguard Station was built in 1920 by the Toronto Harbour Commission along with two others which no longer stand. Jakobek worked there as a lifeguard in the late 1970s for a salary of $83.20/week. In the early 1990s, the City of Toronto planned to tear it down due to its deteriorating condition and to its location which was subject to flooding and erosion, forcing it to be repeatedly moved to higher ground. To prevent its destruction, Jakobek partnered with historians Gene Domagala and Glenn Cochrane to create a group called “Save Our Station (S.O.S.)” which raised $75,000 from the Beach community to preserve it. As a result of this campaign, in 1993 the station was designated a protected structure under the Ontario Heritage Act. As of July 2020, it was still in active use when Jakobek and other Beach area dignitaries celebrated its 100th anniversary, its lifeguards having rescued an estimated 6,000 swimmers over the course of its existence.

==Later life==
In 2008, Jakobek and his family appeared in the Canadian reality TV show &quot;Spoiled Rotten&quot; on Slice, which showcased the family&#x27;s lavish lifestyle. The show was panned by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″ TV critic John Doyle, who characterized the show as being &quot;so appalling that normal people will just want to turn it off.&quot;

Immediately below it in importance, there is a group of Twelve Great Feasts (Greek: Δωδεκάορτον). Together with Pascha, these are the most significant dates on the Orthodox liturgical calendar. Eight of the great feasts are in honor of Jesus Christ, while the other four are dedicated to the Virgin Mary—the Theotokos.

== History and overview ==
The Twelve Great Feasts are as follows (note that the liturgical year begins with the month of September):

# The Nativity of the Theotokos, 
# The Exaltation of the Cross, 
# The Presentation of the Theotokos, 
# The Nativity of Christ (Christmas), 
# The Baptism of Christ (Theophany, also called Epiphany), 
# The Presentation of Jesus at the Temple (Candlemas), 
# The Annunciation, 
# The Entry into Jerusalem (Flowery/Willow/Palm Sunday), the Sunday before Easter
# The Ascension of Christ, forty Days after Easter
# Pentecost, fifty Days after Easter 
# The Transfiguration of Jesus, 
# The Dormition of the Theotokos, 

With the exception of the Presentation/Entrance of the Theotokos, appointed hymns for all of the Twelve Great Feasts are found in the Georgian Iadgari (Chantbook) of Jerusalem which was compiled in approximately the middle of the 6th century. Thus eleven of the twelve feasts were celebrated in the Greek East for some time prior, as most of the hymnographic content is datable to the 5th century.

Besides the Twelve Great Feasts, the Orthodox Church knows five other feasts that rank as great feasts, yet without being numbered among the twelve. They are: the Circumcision of Christ (), the Nativity of St. John the Baptist (), the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (), the Beheading of St John the Baptist (), and the Intercession of the Theotokos ().

In Byzantine art a slightly different group were often depicted as a set, omitting the first three in the list above, and adding the Raising of Lazarus, Crucifixion of Jesus, and Harrowing of Hell.

==Explanations==
=== Nativity of the Theotokos ===
Mary was born to elderly and previously barren parents by the names of Joachim and Anna (now saints), in answer to their prayers. Orthodox Christians do not hold to the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, in which it is taught that Mary was preserved from the ancestral sin that befalls us all as descendants of Adam and Eve, in anticipation of her giving birth to the sinless Christ. The Orthodox believe that Mary, and indeed all mankind, was born only to suffer the consequences of the ancestral sin (being born into a corrupt world surrounded by temptations to sin), the chief of which was the enslavement to Death, and thus needed salvation from this enslavement, like all mankind. The Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception also recognizes that Mary was in need of salvation, viewing her as prevented from falling into the scar of sin, instead of being pulled up out of it. Orthodox thought does vary on whether Mary actually ever sinned, though there is general agreement that she was cleansed from sin at the Annunciation.

=== Exaltation of the Holy Cross ===
The Exaltation of the Holy Cross (also called the Elevation of the Cross) commemorates the recovery of the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified. The Persians had captured it as a prize of war in Jerusalem in the year 614, and it was recovered by the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire (&quot;Byzantine Empire&quot;) in 629. The cross was joyously held up for veneration by the Christian faithful upon its recovery.

=== Presentation of the Theotokos ===
According to Tradition, Mary was taken—presented—to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem as a young girl, where she lived and served until her betrothal to Joseph.

=== Nativity of the Lord ===
December 25—Christmas. The nativity account (Gospel of Luke ) begins with Mary and Joseph (Mary&#x27;s betrothed) traveling to Bethlehem to be enrolled in the Roman census ordered by Augustus Caesar. On the way, they look for a place for Mary to give birth to her child, but all the inns are full and the only suitable place is a cave (show as a stable in most Western descriptions) where animals are kept. The Theotokos (God-bearer, the Virgin Mary) gives birth ineffably (without pain or travail) and remains virgin after childbirth.

=== Theophany (Baptism of the Lord) ===
This observance commemorates Christ&#x27;s baptism by John the Baptist in the River Jordan, and the beginning of Christ&#x27;s earthly ministry (Gospel of Matthew , Gospel of Mark ). It is known by the Orthodox as both Epiphany (i.e., &quot;manifestation&quot;) and Theophany (&quot;manifestation of God&quot;). These are bundled, along with Christmas, differently in some eastern Christian traditions.

=== Presentation of the Lord ===
In the Gospel of Luke , Mary and Joseph took the baby Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem. He was received in the arms of the elder Simeon, who then prayed, &quot;Now let Thy servant depart (die) in peace...for I have seen Thy salvation.&quot; This was one of the things that Mary &quot;pondered in her heart&quot;—the fact that others recognized that her Son was the Messiah. This feast is also known as the Meeting of the Lord, or Hypapante.

=== Annunciation ===
According to the Gospel of Luke , the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary to announce to her that she would conceive and bear a son, even though she &quot;knew no man.&quot; This date is selected to be exactly nine months ahead of Christmas, indicating that Christ was conceived at that time &quot;by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary&quot;, as stated in the Nicene Creed.

=== Entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday) ===
A mere few days before His brutal crucifixion, Jesus was received by adoring throngs at his entry into Jerusalem on the back of young donkey (Gospel of Matthew ). The crowds threw palm branches in his path in jubilation, and even the children shouted praises to Him. The Orthodox celebrate this day with joy, but with the realization that very sad events are soon to come. Among the Russian Orthodox, willow branches are substituted in the celebration of this event, owing to the lack of availability of palm trees in Slavic climes.

=== Ascension ===
Forty days after the Resurrection, while blessing His disciples (Gospel of Luke ), Christ ascended into heaven (Gospel of Mark ), taking His place at the right hand of the Father (Nicene Creed). While the disciples were still looking into the air for Jesus, an angel appeared and told them that the Lord would return again in the same manner as they had seen him go into heaven (Acts of the Apostles ).

=== Pentecost ===
Fifty days after the Resurrection, on the existing Jewish feast of Shavuot, while the disciples and many other followers of Jesus were gathered together to pray, the Holy Spirit descended upon them in the form of &quot;cloven tongues of fire&quot;, with the sound of a rushing mighty wind, and they began to speak in languages that they did not know. There were many visitors from the Jewish diaspora to Jerusalem at that time for the Jewish observance of the feast, and they were astonished to hear these untaught fishermen speaking praises to God in their alien tongues (Acts of the Apostles ).

=== Transfiguration ===
Jesus had gone with his disciples (later called apostles) Peter, James, and John (also called John the Evangelist) to Mount Tabor. Christ&#x27;s appearance was changed while they watched into a glorious radiant figure. There appeared Elijah and Moses, speaking with Jesus. The disciples were amazed and terribly afraid. This event shows forth the divinity of Christ, so that the disciples would understand after his Ascension that He was truly the radiant splendor of the Father, and that his Passion was voluntary. Gospel of Mark 

=== Dormition of the Theotokos ===
The Orthodox feast of the Dormition is analogous to what Roman Catholicism calls the Assumption of Mary. According to Orthodox Tradition, Mary died like all humanity, &quot;falling asleep&quot;, so to speak, as the name of the feast indicates. (Catholic theologians are divided on the issue of whether Mary died. Today most would favor an actual death before the Assumption.) The Apostles were miraculously summoned to this event, and all were present except Thomas when Mary passed from this life. She was buried. Thomas arrived three days later, and desiring to see her one more time, convinced the other apostles to open her tomb. To their surprise, her body was not there.

This event is seen as a first symbol of the resurrection of the faithful that will occur at the Second Coming of Christ. The event is normally called the &quot;Dormition&quot;, though there are many Orthodox Churches with the name &quot;Assumption&quot;. In Greek, &quot;Dormition&quot; is &quot;Kimisis&quot; (Coemesis) -- falling asleep in death—from which the word &quot;cemetery&quot; derives.

<text>The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, also referred to as the Middle States Association or MSA, is an accreditor in the United States. Historically, it has accredited schools in the Mid-Atlantic states region of the northeastern United States. The peer-based, Philadelphia-based non-profit association was founded in 1887. It is a voluntary organization that performs peer evaluation and regional accreditation of public and private schools (including parochial / religious-owned and independent secular schools). 

The association has two commissions, the Middle States Commission on Elementary Schools (MSCES) and Middle States Commission on Secondary Schools (MSCSS). A higher education commission, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), operates completely independently of the other two commissions. MSCSS also accredits some institutions that offer postsecondary education but only those that do not confer academic degrees or offer technical programs.

==Region and scope==
The two Middle States Association Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools (M.S.A.-C.E.S.S.) accredit nearly 2600 public and private schools of elementary and secondary / high schools, along with the various school systems / districts of cities / towns and counties throughout the United States (especially in its originally designated Middle Atlantic states region) and those of American origin in more than 100 other countries around the world.

MSA used to accredit colleges and universities through its higher education commission. In 2013, that commission, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, became a legally separate entity.

<text>Mario Davidovsky (March 4, 1934 – August 23, 2019) was an Argentine-American composer. Born in Argentina, he emigrated in 1960 to the United States, where he lived for the remainder of his life. He is best known for his series of compositions called &quot;Synchronisms&quot;, which in live performance incorporate both acoustic instruments and electroacoustic sounds played from a tape.

==Biography==
Davidovsky was born in Médanos, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a town nearly 600 km southwest of the city of Buenos Aires and close to the seaport of Bahía Blanca. Aged seven, he began his musical studies on the violin. At thirteen he began composing. He studied composition and theory under at the University of Buenos Aires, from which he graduated.

In 1958, he studied with Aaron Copland and Milton Babbitt at the Berkshire Music Center (now the Tanglewood Music Center) in Lenox, Massachusetts. Through Babbitt, who worked at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, and others, Davidovsky developed an interest in electroacoustic music. Copland encouraged Davidovsky to emigrate to the United States, and in 1960, Davidovsky settled in New York City, where he was appointed associate director of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. It was at that time he began to compose electo-acoustic works called &quot;Synchronisms&quot;.

Most of his published compositions since the 1970s have been nonelectronic. His only published electroacoustic compositions since that time are &quot;Synchronisms No. 9&quot; (1988) and &quot;Synchronisms No. 10&quot; (1992). However, Davidovsky received a commission by a group led by the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS) to compose two more electroacoustic works in the &quot;Synchronisms&quot; series. No. 11 and No. 12 premiered in 2007 at the SEAMUS National Conference in Ames, Iowa.

Davidovsky&#x27;s association with the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center continued, and from 1981 to 1993 he was the lab&#x27;s director as well as professor of music at Columbia. In 1994 he became professor of music at Harvard. During his career, Davidovsky has also taught at many other institutions: University of Michigan (1964), the Di Tella Institute of Buenos Aires (1965), the Manhattan School of Music (1968–69), Yale University (1969–70), and the City College of New York (1968–80).

He served on the composition faculty of Mannes College The New School for Music.

In 1982, Davidovsky was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

== Personal life ==
Davidovsky married Elaine Blaustein in 1962; she died in 2017. They had two children, and three grandchildren. He died in New York City on August 23, 2019, at the age of 85.

<doc id="964822" wikidata="Q2872612" url="?curid=964822" title="Automatic double tracking">
<text>Automatic double-tracking or artificial double-tracking (ADT) is an analogue recording technique designed to enhance the sound of voices or instruments during the mixing process. It uses tape delay to create a delayed copy of an audio signal which is then played back at slightly varying speed controlled by an oscillator and combined with the original. The effect is intended to simulate the sound of the natural doubling of voices or instruments achieved by double tracking. The technique was developed in 1966 by engineers at Abbey Road Studios in London at the request of the Beatles.

==Background==
As early as the 1950s, it was discovered that double-tracking the lead vocal in a song gave it a richer, more appealing sound, especially for singers with weak or light voices. Use of this technique became possible with the advent of magnetic tape for use in sound recording. Originally, a pair of single-track tape recorders were used to produce the effect; later, multitrack tape machines were used. Early pioneers of this technique were Les Paul and Buddy Holly.

Before the development of ADT, it was necessary to record and mix multiple takes of the vocal track. Because it is nearly impossible for a performer to sing or play the same part in exactly the same way twice, a recording and blending of two different performances of the same part will create a fuller, &quot;chorused&quot; effect with double tracking. But if one simply plays back two copies of the same performance in perfect sync, the two sound images become one and no double-tracking effect is produced.

==Invention==
ADT was invented specially for the Beatles during the spring of 1966 by Ken Townsend, a recording engineer employed at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios, mainly at the request of John Lennon, who despised the tedium of double tracking during sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative.

Townsend came up with a system using tape delay, . Townsend&#x27;s system added a second tape recorder to the regular setup. When mixing a song, its vocal track was routed from the recording head of the multitrack tape, located before the playback head, and fed to the record head of the second tape recorder. An oscillator was used to vary the speed of the second machine, providing variation in delay and pitch depending on the change in the second machine speed. This signal was then routed from the playback head of the second machine to a separate channel on the mixer. This allowed the vocal delayed by a few milliseconds to be combined with the normal vocal, creating the double-tracked effect.

==Use by the Beatles==
The Beatles were ecstatic over Townsend&#x27;s technique and used it throughout their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot; and on many of their subsequent recordings. It has been incorrectly claimed that the first use of ADT was on the first half of Lennon&#x27;s vocal track on &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, but in actuality, this vocal track features manual double tracking. Most of the double-tracked vocals heard on the rest of the album were created using ADT, while the group also used the technique on a number of the instrumental parts to colour the sounds – there is factually more use of ADT on the mono version of the album than on the more widely known stereo version, with the lead guitar on &quot;Taxman&quot; and the backwards guitar on &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; treated with the effect.

When used on a stereo mix, ADT could be used to create the impression of two different vocal parts on either side of the stereo picture. This technique was used on the stereo mixes of &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Love You To&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; (on &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, the similar effect heard is actually two different vocals manually double-tracked and panned; on &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, the effect is obtained by a combination of manual double-tracking and ADT). This technique could also be applied to instrumental parts as well: on &quot;Love You To&quot;, the same use of ADT was applied to the acoustic guitar track, giving the impression of multiple guitars panned left and right.

==Flanging==
Lennon dubbed the technique &quot;flanging&quot; after producer George Martin jokingly told him it was produced using a &quot;double-bifurcated sploshing flange&quot;. Only years later did Martin learn that another technique, also called flanging, was already in use. The term referred to an engineer alternately pressing and releasing his finger against the flange (rim) of the supply reel on one of two synchronized tape machines as the same audio signal was combined and transferred to a third machine, slightly slowing the machine then allowing it to come back up to speed and in sync with the other, applying a &quot;swooshing&quot; comb filtering effect to the combined audio signal. Alternatively, the engineer could press the flange of one supply reel, then the other, to achieve a fuller effect.

An additional explanation for the pedigree of flanging has it named after Fred Flange, a pseudonym given to Matt Monro by Peter Sellers, who used a Monro recording to open his 1959 Sinatra parody album &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Sellers&quot;. The album was produced by Martin, and presumably the connection with flanging comes from Monro&#x27;s mimicking (double-tracking) Sinatra. Engineers at Abbey Road realised that the technique they had developed needed a proper technical name and eventually christened it ADT, short for &quot;Artificial Double Tracking&quot;, although elsewhere the term &quot;Automatic Double Tracking&quot; became more common.

==ADT versus manual double tracking==
Townsend&#x27;s process succeeded in simulating manual double tracking quite effectively; however, attentive listeners can often tell the difference between ADT and &quot;real&quot; double tracking, with the former having a synthetic quality to it and having none of the audible differences between the vocal tracks frequently present in the latter. Over the years, many artists, including the Beatles, continued to use both manual double tracking, ADT, or a combination of both in different circumstances depending on the effects they wished to achieve, with each technique thought to have certain unique qualities of its own.

==Use in music==
The Beatles used ADT widely in conjunction with manual double-tracking on all their subsequent albums, with the exception of &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which was initially intended to be an &quot;honest&quot; album utilising no technical artifice (ADT can still be heard on the finished album, however, because Phil Spector treated a Hammond organ part with it on his mix of the title track). Some notable examples of ADT used by the Beatles in the years following &quot;Revolver&quot; include &quot;Within You Without You&quot; (on which ADT was purportedly used on almost every vocal and instrumental part on the track), &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; (which uses ADT in conjunction with equalisation to help simulate a &quot;fake stereo&quot; effect on the second half of the stereo mix, which was sourced from the mono mix, by splitting the entire mix between the channels), and the unusually wide ADT used on the lead vocal tracks on &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; and &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;. On &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, Eric Clapton used ADT to make his guitar sound &#x27;less bluesy&#x27;, according to Ian MacDonald in &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;.

===Other users of ADT===
Townsend&#x27;s technique, and minor variations on it, quickly caught on with other artists and record producers. Former Beatles engineer Norman Smith used ADT extensively on Pink Floyd&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, recorded at Abbey Road in 1967. As well as using it for more conventional simulated double tracking, Smith made much use of the technique to split Syd Barrett&#x27;s vocals between the stereo channels. In some cases, Smith (or possibly Barrett himself) used such extraordinarily wide ADT in this way as to give the slightly disorientating impression of not so much double tracking but two quite separate voices on either channel wildly out of time with each other – the best example of this is perhaps on &quot;Bike&quot;. Similar effects were later used on some of Barrett&#x27;s solo works, perhaps indicating his fondness for this unusual use of ADT. Pink Floyd themselves continued to use ADT on most, if not all, of their subsequent albums up until the 1980s, with one notable use being on &quot;Alan&#x27;s Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;, where a part of the drum track is treated with ADT. 
In the US, Simon and Garfunkel began to use ADT on stereo mixes of their songs to split vocal tracks between the channels, examples of which include &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and &quot;Cecilia&quot;.

Gary Kellgren, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s engineer, used ADT extensively on all of Hendrix&#x27;s albums. He frequently split vocal, guitar, and even drum parts between the stereo channels.

As the music industry&#x27;s hunger for technological advances increased, new devices were created to make it easier and faster to achieve the same results. Thus, the industry saw analogue delay devices created and brought to market that no longer needed tape machines to achieve the ADT effect. They used electronic circuits instead. Much later on, these analogue delays were augmented by digital delay units. There has since been a thriving market among guitarists and other musicians for guitar pedals, or effects units, reproducing chorus and delay that owe their development to ADT. Nowadays, the ADT and similar effects are available as computer software plugins.

===Psychedelic music===
With the rise of psychedelic music, many artists used variations on Townsend&#x27;s technique to create the &quot;flanging&quot; effect mentioned above, adding a slightly disorienting &quot;swooshing&quot; quality to instruments and voices (although in practice this effect is actually more similar to what today is called &quot;phasing&quot; rather than &quot;flanging&quot;). The Beatles themselves used this effect on &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and more prominently on &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;. A notable example of this technique is &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; by the Small Faces, where the effect is prominent almost throughout the entire track, particularly on the vocals, drums and cymbals during the chorus. Hendrix also used this technique extensively. An example of an ADT variation being used to create an effect more similar to what is considered &quot;flanging&quot; today (rather than phasing) is on the Beatles&#x27; White Album tracks &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; (acoustic guitar) and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (lead guitar).

===Doubling echo===
A similar technique to ADT is doubling echo, which uses short delays to mimic the double-tracking effect. Many effects units were developed to produce similar sounds, such as chorus, flangers, and phasers, all of which use an oscillating delay (or, in the phaser, a variable phase network). Other notable uses of ADT doubling echo are apparent on select material by Elton John. Some examples of this can be heard on Nigel Olsson&#x27;s drums, especially the tom toms, on the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot; from the &quot;Caribou&quot; album, as well as &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; and 
&quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; on &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot;.

==Arrival of digital technology==
With the advent of digital recording, tape- and analogue-based delay methods have not been much used, though many of these analogue techniques are frequently emulated using comparable digital techniques, or in some cases plugins which are used to extend the capabilities of a digital audio workstation. Some musicians and engineers may casually use the term ADT to refer to any form of simulated double tracking, including digital delay used in this manner. One of the very few examples of the original ADT technique being used in recent times is on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Anthology&quot; albums from the mid-1990s, on which George Martin and Geoff Emerick decided to revive the analogue technique rather than simply use the modern digital alternatives to achieve a more authentic sound, feeling that ADT produced a warmer, less synthetic sound than digital delay and the latter would be inappropriate for use on recordings made on analogue equipment in the 1960s.

<doc id="964829" wikidata="Q3209656" url="?curid=964829" title="The War Against the Jews">
<text>The War Against the Jews is a 1975 book by Lucy Dawidowicz. The book researches the Holocaust of the European Jewry during World War II.

The author contends that Adolf Hitler pursued his policies to eliminate Jewish populations throughout Europe even to the detriment of pragmatic wartime actions such as moving troops and securing supply lines. As an example, Dawidowicz notes that Hitler delayed railcars providing supplies to front line troops in the Soviet Union so that Jews could be deported by rail from the USSR to death camps. She uses records of &quot;one-way&quot; rail tickets as additional documentation of those sent to camps.

Dawidowicz also draws a line of &quot;anti-Semitic descent&quot; from Martin Luther to Hitler, writing that both men were obsessed by the &quot;demonologized universe&quot; inhabited by Jews. She contends that similarities between Luther&#x27;s anti-Jewish writings, especially &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot;, and modern anti-Semitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of &quot;Judenhass&quot; (Jew-hatred), which she traces back to the biblical Haman&#x27;s advice to Ahasuerus. She argues that though modern anti-Semitism has its roots in German nationalism, the foundation of Christian anti-Semitism was laid by the Catholic Church and &quot;upon which Luther built.&quot;

The book also provides detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in World War II. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews.

== Criticism by Raul Hilberg ==
Raul Hilberg, widely considered to be one of the world&#x27;s preeminent Holocaust scholars, published his three-volume, 1,273-page &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot;, in 1961; this work is regarded today as a seminal study of the Nazi Final Solution. Hilberg notes that Dawidowicz not only ignored &quot;The Destruction&quot;&#x27;s findings in &quot;The War Against the Jews&quot;, but also went on to exclude mention of him in her historiographic work, &quot;The Holocaust and the Historians&quot;, published in 1981. Hilberg&#x27;s work, running as it did against the grain of intentionalist thinking, was widely unpopular among many early scholars, a contrast to later views. It is argued that Davidowicz, a renowned &quot;intentionalist&quot;, simply ignored Hilberg&#x27;s work in order to follow an academically safer path, avoiding controversy by avoiding &quot;functionalist&quot; conclusions like those drawn by Hilberg. &quot;She wanted preeminence,&quot; Hilberg writes. Within a death toll often viewed as ranging from a low estimate of five million to a high estimate of seven million, Hilberg&#x27;s own detailed breakdown in The Destruction reveals a total estimated death toll of 5.1 million Jews.

<doc id="964832" wikidata="Q994671" url="?curid=964832" title="Brutal Truth">
<text>Brutal Truth was an American grindcore band from New York City, formed by ex-Anthrax, Nuclear Assault, and Stormtroopers of Death bass guitarist Dan Lilker in 1990. The group disbanded in 1999, but reformed in 2006 and continued to release music until 2014.

== History ==
Brutal Truth was formed in 1990 in New York City. The band was originally signed to Earache Records, on which they released two albums, &quot;Extreme Conditions Demand Extreme Responses&quot; and &quot;Need to Control&quot;, as well as an EP entitled &quot;Perpetual Conversion&quot;, and 7-inch singles for the songs &quot;Ill Neglect&quot; and &quot;Godplayer&quot;. During this time, music videos were made for the songs &quot;Ill Neglect&quot;, &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; and &quot;Godplayer&quot;. Brutal Truth were frustrated with Earache Records and switched to Relapse Records, known for its roster of grindcore acts, with whom they stayed until the band&#x27;s demise.

With Relapse, they released the mini album &quot;Kill Trend Suicide&quot;, a full-length release entitled &quot;Sounds of the Animal Kingdom&quot; and a double CD live album called &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;. The band has also released many split 7-inch singles on smaller labels, with most of these being out of print and difficult to find. The songs from these 7-inch singles were collected on the second disc of &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;.

The band disbanded around 1999 due to internal financial and management conflicts.

In 2001, the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; awarded Brutal Truth the record for &quot;shortest music video&quot; for their video &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;, which is 2.18 seconds long and consists of 48 still images in rapid succession followed by a clip of an explosion.
Drummer Richard Hoak also provides vocals and drums for a project titled Total Fucking Destruction. Kevin Sharp released an album with Venomous Concept in 2004, a hardcore punk band featuring members from the  Melvins and Napalm Death. He was also a member of Australian grind band Damaged for a little over a year in 1999. He is also currently involved with the Atlanta-based hardcore-metal, grindcore band, Primate, with guitarist Bill Kelliher from Mastodon. Dan Lilker now plays for a host of bands and is currently bassist for the re-united Nuclear Assault.

Brutal Truth re-formed in 2006 with three-quarters of the final lineup returning (Lilker, Hoak and Sharp); Erik Burke (of Lethargy) replaced Brent McCarty on guitar.

On July 8, 2008, four new Brutal Truth tracks were released on the &quot;This Comp Kills Fascists&quot; compilation. This is the first new material from the band in almost ten years.

On January 21, 2009, it was announced that Brutal Truth had finished recording a new album, entitled &quot;Evolution Through Revolution&quot;.

<doc id="964835" wikidata="Q16988627" url="?curid=964835" title="Deputy Mayor of London">
<text>A Deputy Mayor is a member of the London Mayoral cabinet, in the executive arm of the Greater London Authority. They serve as political advisors with responsibilities and powers corresponding to portfolios delegated by the Mayor. One of them must be designated as the Statutory Deputy Mayor, a member of the London Assembly who serves as the temporary Mayor during a vacancy or temporary incapacity of the Mayor.

==History==
Colour key (for political parties): 

Current or final office holders of a mayoralty are highlighted in bold.

===Livingstone mayoralties===
The 2000 London mayoral election was won by Ken Livingstone, who ran as an independent after being expelled from the Labour Party. He announced that he would rotate the position of deputy mayor equally between the four parties represented in the London Assembly (London Labour, London Conservatives, London Liberal Democrats and the London Green Party). He offered the role to Nicky Gavron of the Labour Party for the first year. After some political manoeuvring, she accepted.

However, in 2001, Ken Livingstone decided not to offer the role to the Conservatives, claiming it would be disruptive, so Nicky Gavron retained the post. In 2002 the Liberal Democrats were asked to nominate a candidate but declined, saying that it would be better to scrutinise the mayor from an independent position. Again Nicky Gavron remained. In 2003, the Greens accepted an offer to nominate a deputy mayor and selected Jenny Jones, who became London&#x27;s second deputy mayor.

Nicky Gavron was originally chosen as the Labour candidate for the 2004 London mayoral election but she stepped aside when Ken Livingstone was invited to rejoin the party. They then ran on a joint ticket as Labour&#x27;s candidates for the posts of mayor and deputy mayor. She served as Ken Livingstone&#x27;s deputy for the duration of his second term.

In his first term, Ken Livingstone came under fire for delegating his powers to his chief of staff, Simon Fletcher, rather than the deputy mayor on several occasions.

===Johnson mayoralties===
After Boris Johnson became Mayor of London in May 2008, he appointed Richard Barnes as his statutory Deputy Mayor, with the specific responsibility for community cohesion and regeneration. However, he also gave the title of Deputy Mayor to several other people, each with a specific role: Ian Clement (Government Relations); Kit Malthouse (Policing); and Ray Lewis (Young People).

Sir Simon Milton, a former councillor, served as Deputy Mayor of Policy and Planning and Chief of Staff to Johnson until his death in office in 2011. In May 2011, Sir Edward Lister was then appointed as his successor. Richard Barnes ceased to be Deputy Mayor on 4 May 2012, when he lost his seat in the Assembly. Victoria Borwick succeeded him in the post. Borwick resigned in May 2015, following her election as Member of Parliament for Kensington, being succeeded by Roger Evans.

===Khan mayoralty===
The 2016 London mayoral election was won by Sadiq Khan for London Labour. Following the election, he appointed Joanne McCartney Statutory Deputy Mayor, along with nine additional deputy mayors, making Khan the first mayor to use all ten available Deputy Mayor spots.

<doc id="964844" wikidata="Q2493612" url="?curid=964844" title="Nuestra Familia">
<text>Nuestra Familia (Spanish for &quot;our family&quot;) is a criminal organization of Mexican American (Chicano) prison gangs with origins in Northern California. While members of the Norteños gang are considered to be foot soldiers of Nuestra Familia, being a member of Nuestra Familia itself does not signify association as a Norteño. Some law enforcement agents speculate that the Nuestra Familia gang, which operates in and out of prisons, influences much of the criminal activity of thousands of Norteño gang members in California. The gang&#x27;s main sources of income are distributing cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine within prison systems as well as in the community and extorting drug distributors on the streets.

==History==
===Origins===
Nuestra Familia was organized at Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, California in 1965. In the late 1960s, Mexican-American inmates of the California state prison system began to separate into two rival groups, Nuestra Familia and the 1957-formed Mexican Mafia, according to the locations of their hometowns (the north-south dividing line is Bakersfield, California). The inmates who formed the Nuestra Familia gang banded together to protect themselves from the Mexican Mafia but then grew to be involved in drug dealing, extortion and robbery.

Nuestra Familia are prison enemies of the Southern Chicanos who consisted of La eMe, better known as the Mexican Mafia. While the Mexican Mafia had initially been created to protect Mexicans in prison, there was a perceived level of abuse by members of La eMe towards the imprisoned chicanos from rural farming areas of Northern California. The spark that led to the ongoing war between Nuestra Familia and members of the Mexican Mafia involved a situation in 1965 in which a member of La eMe stole a pair of shoes from a Northerner at Deuel Vocational Institute in Tracy. This event put into motion the longest-running gang war in the state of California.

The Nuestra Familia was not recognized as a prison gang by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation until 1979.

===Renewed organization===

Since the written constitution of the Norteños stated that the gang&#x27;s leaders resided in Pelican Bay State Prison in California; the relocation of the five leaders led to turmoil among its members. The leadership vacuum resulted in a power struggle between prospective generals.

Eventually, three new generals came to power at Pelican Bay, yet two were demoted, leaving only David &quot;DC&quot; Cervantes as the highest-ranking member of the gang in California. Cervantes&#x27; rise marked the first time in decades that the Norteños had a single leader at the helm of their criminal organization. The remaining leadership of the organization in Pelican Bay consists of Daniel &quot;Stork&quot; Perez, Anthony &quot;Chuco&quot; Guillen and George &quot;Puppet&quot; Franco. While all Nuestra Familia soldiers and captains in California are expected to follow the orders of Cervantes, a small percentage of the gang remains loyal to the former generals and captains imprisoned in Colorado. Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had complained that keeping the five remaining gang leaders located in the same prison only continued to add to California gang violence, and that they should be scattered throughout different prisons. While the recognized leaders of Nuestra Familia in Pelican Bay ask that members respect the former leaders, they have been effectively stripped of their authority.

==Membership==
While Nuestra Familia is primarily a Chicano gang, membership sometimes extends to other Latinos as well as non-Latinos. Members of the organization are considered to have taken a &quot;blood oath&quot; to join the gang, and are considered lifelong participants. Nuestra Familia&#x27;s written constitution allegedly states that no member should prioritize women, money or drugs over their membership in the gang. Membership in the gang extends beyond prison. Women are not allowed to become full-fledged members of Nuestra Familia, but are sometimes used for communication and drug-running purposes as they are considered less likely to be noticed by law enforcement agents. The NF has a formal written constitution and a membership of approximately 250, with an additional 1,000 associates.

==Symbols==
Members of Nuestra Familia are known to wear red bandanas (&quot;red rags&quot;) to identify themselves. Other symbols include use of the number 14 or XIV, as the letter &quot;N&quot; is the 14th letter of the English alphabet. Nuestra Familia members often use the image of a sombrero with a machete as their gang symbol.

==Investigations and prosecutions==
===Operation Black Widow===
Federal law enforcement agencies, long unable to infiltrate Nuestra Familia, began to step up their investigations in the late 1990s. In 2000 and 2001, 22 members were indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges, including several who were allegedly serving as high-ranking gang leaders while confined in Pelican Bay. Thirteen of the defendants pleaded guilty; the other cases are still ongoing. Two of the defendants face the death penalty for ordering murders related to the drug trade. The largest of the federal investigations was Operation Black Widow. At the time of Operation Black Widow, law enforcement officials had estimated that Nuestra Familia was responsible for at least 600 murders in the previous 30 years.

In the aftermath of Operation Black Widow, the five highest-ranking leaders of Nuestra Familia, James &quot;Tibbs&quot; Morado, Joseph &quot;Pinky&quot; Hernandez, Gerald &quot;Cuete&quot; Rubalcaba, Cornelio Tristan, and Tex Marin Hernandez, were transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado.

===Operation Knockout===
In April 2010, federal and local law enforcement agencies concluded what was considered the most significant effort to dismantle the Central Coast leadership structure of Nuestra Familia. After months of investigation, at least 37 alleged gang members were arrested during the raids conducted. Law enforcement authorities seized 40 pounds of cocaine, 14 pounds of marijuana, and dozens of firearms.

===2013 indictments===
On June 11, 2013, Santa Clara County district attorney Jeff Rosen announced the indictment of 48 Nuestra Familia associates on 77 felony charges ranging from drug dealing to murder.

<text>The (&#x27;The Sermon of the Wolf to the English&#x27;) is the title given to a homily composed in England between 1010 and 1016 by Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York (died 1023), who commonly styled himself &#x27;, or &#x27;wolf&#x27; after the first element in his name [&#x27; = &#x27;wolf-stone&#x27;]. Though the title is Latin, the work itself is written in Old English. The &#x27; is Wulfstan&#x27;s most [[Works of Wulfstan of York|well-known work]]. In it, he blames a lack of moral discipline amongst his fellow [[Anglo-Saxon England|English]] as the source of God&#x27;s anger against the English, which has taken the shape of thirty years of [[Viking]] raids against England. Wulfstan exhorts the English to behave in a manner more pleasing to God, and specifically to live according to the laws of the Church and of the king. The&#x27; is noted for its rhetorical achievements, and is considered to represent the height of Wulfstan&#x27;s skill as a homilist and rhetor. The text of the &#x27; has been critically edited many times, most recently by Dorothy Bethurum. The work contains one of several mentions of Old English&#x27;, a term cognate to the Old Norse &quot;&quot;—valkyries.

==Historical context==
Wulfstan&#x27;s past is obscure, though it is possible that he began his ecclesiastical career as a Benedictine monk. We know that he became Bishop of London in 996, perhaps already aged nearly 50. In 1002 he was simultaneously promoted to Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York. He held both sees in plurality until 1016, when he relinquished Worcester. He remained archbishop of York until his death. It was perhaps while he was Bishop of London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons, or homilies, perhaps specifically on the topic of Antichrist.

As Archbishop of York, Wulfstan&#x27;s administrative duties were considerable. In addition to tending the spiritual and financial needs of the religious and secular communities of the North of England, he was deeply involved in the vital politics of the South. He was one of the most important members of king Æthelred II&#x27;s advisory council, known as the Witan, and as such was active in all the most significant political decisions of the day. By 1008 he had secured the privilege of drafting the official royal legislation promulgated by the king and the Witan. He was deeply concerned with legislation, holding that good laws were essential if a people were to prosper. He continued as the king&#x27;s chief legal draftsman on into the reign of the Danish king Cnut the Great. It is both remarkable and puzzling that Wulfstan was able to play so central a role in politics under both Æthelred&#x27;s and Cnut&#x27;s reigns, especially as it was under Æthelred&#x27;s reign that Wulfstan, in his &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot;, so vehemently decried the depredations of the Danish and Norwegian Vikings.

King Æthelred II — nicknamed Æthelred &#x27;The Unready&#x27; - ruled England from 978–1016. For virtually his entire reign, England was the object of successive Viking raids. Between the period of 980–1016, few areas of southern England remained unscathed as first Viking raiding parties, then entire Viking armies looted and ravaged the English countryside. Æthelred, roundly criticised by historians as ineffectual in the face of the Viking onslaught, was never able to mount a successful offense against the nimble Viking fleets, and his efforts to defend his kingdom against Viking armies were continually undermined. Æthelred and his advisors eventually adopted a policy of buying off the Viking armies with money. These enormous payments, known as Danegeld, had to be levied against English landowners and citizens, and this had a devastating impact on the English economy. Together, the Viking raids and the Danegeld payments brought the English people to their knees. But the Viking assaults continued. Few Englishmen during this time would have seen any reason to be optimistic about his own future or that of his countrymen. The situation became desperate in 1013, when, despite Æthelred, a prominent leader of the Viking armies, Swein Forkbeard, managed to position himself as king of England. In response, Æthelred retreated to Normandy where he remained until Swein&#x27;s death the following year, upon which he immediately negotiated his safe return to England and his reinstatement as king. It is of these events that one of the versions of the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; makes mention. Wulfstan&#x27;s role in these events are unclear, though sentiments he expresses elsewhere in his writings suggest that he would have supported Æthelred&#x27;s cause over any Dane&#x27;s. Dorothy Whitelock writes that &quot;we have no evidence where Wulfstan was at the time of the submission [of England to Swein], but he was at York within a fortnight of [Swegn&#x27;s] death, and we may suspect that he used his influence to win back the province to the English king Æthelred.&quot;

==Authorship and dating==
Though Wulfstan&#x27;s name is never directly attached to the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot;, there is no question of Wulfstan&#x27;s authorship. The text of the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; has survived in five manuscripts, a number of which associate the homily with Wulfstan&#x27;s &quot;nom de plume&quot;, &quot;Lupus&quot;. The five manuscripts represent the text in three versions, one shorter and two longer. It is generally accepted that the shorter version is the original, and that one of the longer versions is a later authorial revision; that is, Wulfstan composed the homily, then later re-worked and expanded it. These versions thus provide an opportunity to study the practices of an Old English writer as he revises his own work.

The longer version, which Wulfstan probably revised himself, exists in a manuscript known to have been annotated and worked over by the archbishop; in fact, there are many corrections to the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; in this manuscript which were carried out by Wulfstan&#x27;s own pen. The rubric, or title, for the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; in this manuscript reads: &quot;Sermo Lupi ad Anglos quando Dani maxime persecuti sunt eos, quod fuit anno millesimo XIIII ab incarnatione Domini nostri Iesu Cristi&quot;, &#x27;The sermon of the Wolf to the English at the time when the Danes [Vikings] harried them, which was in the 1014th year from the birth of Jesus Christ.&#x27; Thus the date at which the revision was made was probably 1014. This was the year that Æthelred returned to England from Normandy and resumed his position as king of the English. It is also the year of a great royal council, at which Æthelred and his Witan published a new law code. There is good reason to associate these events with a special oral delivery of the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; by Wulfstan to the re-constituted English Witan. It seems significant that the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; specifically mentions Æthelred&#x27;s exile, recalling it with regret.

==Rhetorical style and technique==

Wulfstan not only abstractly discussed the correlation between the Viking invasions and the anger of God, but also explicitly stated the types of acts that God would find condemnable. In order to emphasize the severity of their situation, Wulfstan employed a variety of rhetorical techniques to elicit a sense of urgency (phrase repetition, metaphorical language, etc.). Rather than suggesting a unified stance against the Vikings, he implored his congregation/English population to abandon the behaviors of plundering, selling one another into slavery, betraying one&#x27;s lord, buying women for sexual gratification, breaking religious and moral pledges, praising false gods, and a variety of other deplorable acts. Wulfstan, however, articulated that it was still possible to avoid the apocalypse/wrath of God, if they steered away from the devil and instead remain obedient and respectful to the Almighty.

Wulfstan attained a high degree of competence in rhetorical prose, working with a distinctive rhythmical system based around alliterative pairings. He used intensifying words, distinctive vocabulary and compounds, rhetorical figures, and repeated phrases as literary devices. These devices lend Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies their tempo-driven, almost feverish quality, allowing them to build toward multiple climaxes. The genius of his style is based chiefly on sound and parallelsim. The passage below, taken from the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot;, employs numerous rhetorical devices, including alliteration, parallelism, tautology, and rhyme:

The &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot;, as with all of Wulfstan&#x27;s literary works, is known for its frequent, almost habitual, use of intensifying phrases. Examples from the passage above include &quot;oft &amp; gelome&quot; &quot;often and frequently&quot; and &quot;swyþe þearle&quot; &quot;very terribly.&quot; Other intensifying phrases frequently used by Wulfstan, in the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; and in other of his works, are &quot;ealles to swyðe&quot; &quot;altogether too much&quot;, &quot;georne&quot; &quot;eagerly&quot;, &quot;mide rihte&quot; &quot;in right manner&quot;, &quot;for Gode and for worulde&quot; &quot;for God and for world&quot;, among others. Famously, Wulfstan often created long &#x27;lists of sinners&#x27;, wherein he joined a series terms (of compound words, and often used by no one else) into groups using alliteration. One of the most famous examples is found in the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot;:

A similar device is at work in his list of afflictions in the first passage given above (&quot;here &amp; hunger, bryne &amp; blodgyte ... stalu &amp; cwalu, stric &amp; steorfa, orfcwealm &amp; uncoþu, hol &amp; hete...&quot;). The &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; is considered to excel particularly in the use of repetition as a rhetorical device . Other devices which have been noticed in Wulfstan&#x27;s works are &quot;dubitatio&quot; and &quot;verborum exornatio&quot;. His works are almost completely without metaphor and simile, and Wulfstan as a rule shies away from narrative and descriptions of the particular. The &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; is one of his only works where description (i.e. of the moral decline of the nation) plays a significant role.

Wulfstan&#x27;s &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; also employs the rhetorical device known as &quot;Ubi sunt&quot; (Latin, &quot;where are... ?&quot;), a common medieval literary refrain used &quot;to designate a mood or theme in literature of lament for the mutability of things.&quot; Though the refrain never properly arises in the &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; (in English nor in Latin), the theme is nevertheless vigorously active as Wulfstan presents the cherished goods and virtues of the past as lost in the present due to the moral decline of Men and the world through time.

==Primary themes==
*The world nears its end, and worsens every day as the time of Antichrist approaches. The Devil has led the English nation astray. Evil and injustice fill the land and none seeks a remedy. We have suffered much, yet we have deserved much. Even in heathen lands offerings are made to gods, but here we have stripped the Church and her servants of honour and of wealth. Since King Edgar&#x27;s death, the laws of England have greatly deteriorated. Sanctuaries are violated, widows are forced to marry unjustly, and many are made poor and taken advantage of and sold into slavery abroad. Children are enslaved for stealing, and the rights of citizens and slaves are taken away. God&#x27;s own laws and teachings are hated. We are disgraced through God&#x27;s anger, and it will become worse for us unless we seek His protection.
*Much afflicts the nation, and no one prospers. Violence, hunger, pestilence, hate, and theft are rampant. Heavy taxation afflicts everyone. Storms ruin crops. The ties of kinship are no longer meaningful. We have made our own desires into law, and have ignored true law. Everyone seeks to betray and insult his neighbour. A lord is betrayed by his own men. The worst crime is to betray one&#x27;s lord to death or to drive him from the land. Both have occurred here recently: King Edward was murdered and burned, and King Æthelred was driven from his own kingdom. Innocent people have been slaughtered too often. Rich men frequently neglect to upkeep religious houses.
*It is terrible to know that men often jointly purchase a woman, ravage her like dogs, and then sell her again to their enemies. Fathers sell their sons for profit, and sons their mothers. Too many perjure themselves and break oaths. A slave will flee his master to become Viking, and gains more honour thereby than his previous master keeps. We disgracefully pay off our enemies, and the English are continually defeated. Pirates are made strong, and one of them can drive away ten of our own, so afflicted are we with sin. Our lot is misery and public shame for we honour those who injure us and pay who humiliate us.
*The nation is corrupted through vice. Crimes of every sort are perpetrated. Men are more ashamed now of good deeds than of evil ones. On account of pride no one repents of their sins, though books tell us to. We must seek remedy through repentance if we are to protect ourselves from God&#x27;s anger, lest we suffer the fate of the Britons. The Britons were also afflicted with too many sins, and did not call out against evil when they saw it. Through their pride they angered God and he made foreigners (then the Anglo-Saxons) invade this island and take it from them.
*Thus let us turn to what is right and abandon wickedness. Let us follow God&#x27;s laws and the king&#x27;s, and atone for our wrongdoings. Let us behave as we promised we would at baptism. Let us keep oaths and be loyal to each other, and think about the Final Judgement and save ourselves from the torments of eternal fire; let us gain for ourselves instead the eternal rewards of Heaven.

==Historical relevance==

In the sermon, Wulfstan addresses the entire English nation and holds it accountable for the country&#x27;s plight. A key element of Wulfstan&#x27;s sermon was the connection he made between the initial Anglo-Saxon rulers of England (who drove out the Britons from the country) and the Danes who were currently plaguing the country. According to Gildas, the Britons had been defeated because they had sinned against God. God had therefore allowed them to be vanquished. Wulfstan warns his listeners to learn from the past, and not share the fate of the Britons.

The Sermon of the Wolf is one of many homilies that attribute the Viking raids to the anger of God. In understanding this text as part of Old English homilies that equated and analyzed physical events and natural processes with transcendental forces, modern audiences can observe Christian theology firmly manifesting itself in the psychology of the English population (a theology that most would have been unaware of only a few centuries earlier.) Inadvertently, such types of evocative speeches/texts presented the English as their own worst enemy, ultimately culminating in a passive response toward Viking conquests as they were not the source of their plagues. This attitude thus allowed the Danes to proceed further inland and form their own settlements in various regions.

The sermon has been regarded as &quot;an invaluable witness to the dismal state of affairs in Æthelred&#x27;s reign&quot;, as it is one of the only contemporary documents which describes the effects of the Viking invasions in the beginning of the eleventh century.

<text>Hannah Louise Spearritt (born 1 April 1981) is an English singer and actress. She is an original member of the pop group S Club. Spearritt is known for playing the role of Abby Maitland in the British science-fiction drama &quot;Primeval&quot; (2007–2011), Mercedes Christie in &quot;Casualty&quot; (2016) and Kandice Taylor in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2017–2018).

==Career==
===1994–1998: Stage===
When she was 12, Spearritt landed a part in the Lowestoft Players amateur dramatics society&#x27;s production of &quot;Annie&quot;. Thereafter, she successfully auditioned for the National Youth Music Theatre, and became part of the company. (1994–1995), &quot;Tin Pan Ali&quot; (1996), and the West End musical &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1997). In 1998, she was cast in the television film &quot;The Cater Street Hangman&quot;, playing the role of a maid who gets murdered. Spearritt also made appearances on the National Lottery and &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

===1999–2023: S Club===

In 1998, Spearritt auditioned for and became a member of S Club. In the five years they were together, the group had four UK number one singles and a UK number one album. They recorded a total of four studio albums, released eleven singles and went on to sell over fourteen million albums worldwide. Their first album, &quot;S Club&quot;, had a strong 1990s pop sound, similar to many artists of their time. However, through the course of their career, their musical approach changed to a more dance and R&amp;B sound which is heard mostly in their final album, &quot;Seeing Double&quot;. Spearritt led some of the tracks on the groups&#x27; albums, such as &quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot; and &quot;Hey Kitty Kitty&quot;, the latter which was also a promotional single for Sunny Delight. S Club 7 won two BRIT Awards—in 2000 for British breakthrough act and in 2002, for Best British Single. In 2001, the group earned the Record of the Year award. On 21 April 2003, during a live onstage performance, S Club announced that they were to disband. 

On 14 November 2014, S Club reunited for a BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon, performing a medley of &quot;S Club Party&quot;, &quot;Reach&quot;, &quot;Bring It All Back&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot;. On 28 April 2015, S Club 7 reissued &quot;Best: The Greatest Hits of S Club 7&quot;, with a previously unreleased song, &quot;Rain&quot;, as well as &quot;Friday Night&quot; from the &quot;S Club&quot; album. In May, S Club 7 performed in UK arenas on the Bring It All Back 2015 tour. In February 2023, it was announced the group would reform for a second time. In April, a few weeks after the announcement, Paul Cattermole unexpectedly died. In May, the group confirmed they would be carrying on but Spearritt would not be joining them following Cattermole&#x27;s death.

===2003–present: Acting and television===
In 2003, she was in Los Angeles to audition for a role in the film &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot;, a fact that she revealed at the UK premiere of the film on 24 March 2004 in London. In 2004, Spearritt appeared in horror film &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot;. In 2005, she appeared in the BBC series &quot;Blessed&quot; as Sarah. In December 2005, Spearritt appeared in the West End musical &quot;Snow! The Musical&quot;, at London&#x27;s Sound Theatre.

In 2006, it was revealed that Spearritt had landed a lead role in the ITV series &quot;Primeval&quot;. She portrayed the role of Abby Maitland, a reptile enthusiast who gets mixed up with time travelling Professor Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) after discovering a species of reptile she had never encountered. Later that year, she made an appearance in &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;. In March 2012, Spearritt took over the role of Pauline in &quot;One Man, Two Guvnors&quot; at the Theatre Royal Haymarket.

<text>John Ireland (baptized September 11, 1838 – September 25, 1918) was an American prelate who was the third Catholic bishop and first archbishop of Saint Paul, Minnesota (1888–1918). He became both a religious as well as civic leader in Saint Paul during the turn of the 20th century. Ireland was known for his progressive stance on education, immigration and relations between church and state, as well as his opposition to saloons, alcoholism, political machines, and political corruption.

He promoted the Americanization of Catholicism, especially through imposing the English only movement on Catholic parishes by force, a private war against the Eastern Catholic Churches, seeking to make Catholic schools identical to public schools through the Poughkeepsie plan, and through other progressive social ideas. He was widely considered the primary leader of the modernizing element in the Catholic Church in the United States during the Progressive Era, which brought him into open conflict over minority language rights and theology with both his suffragen Bishop Otto Zardetti and eventually with Pope Leo XIII, whose Apostolic letter &quot;Testem benevolentiae nostrae&quot; condemned Archbishop Ireland&#x27;s ideas as the heresy of Americanism. He also created or helped to create many religious and educational institutions in Minnesota.

==History==
John Ireland was born in Burnchurch, County Kilkenny, Ireland, and was baptized on September 11, 1838. He was the second of seven children born to Richard Ireland, a carpenter, and his second wife, Judith Naughton. His family immigrated to the United States in 1848 and eventually moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1852. One year later Joseph Crétin, first bishop of Saint Paul, sent Ireland to the preparatory seminary of Meximieux in France. Ireland was consequently ordained in 1861 in Saint Paul. He served as a chaplain of the Fifth Minnesota Regiment in the Civil War until 1863 when ill health caused his resignation. Later, he was famous nationwide in the Grand Army of the Republic.

He was appointed pastor at Saint Paul&#x27;s cathedral in 1867, a position which he held until 1875. In 1875, he was made coadjutor bishop of St. Paul and in 1884 he became bishop ordinary. In 1888 he became archbishop with the elevation of his diocese and the erection of the ecclesiastical province of Saint Paul. Ireland retained this title for 30 years until his death in 1918. Before Ireland died he burned all his personal papers. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery.

Ireland was personal friends with Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. At a time when most Irish Catholics were staunch Democrats, Ireland was known for being close to the Republican party. Privately Ireland would tell people he was a member of the party. He opposed racial inequality and called for &quot;equal rights and equal privileges, political, civil, and social.&quot; 
Ireland&#x27;s funeral was attended by eight archbishops, thirty bishops, twelve monsignors, seven hundred priests and two hundred seminarians.

He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by Yale University in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university.

A friend of James J. Hill, whose wife Mary was Catholic (even though Hill was not), Archbishop Ireland had his portrait painted in 1895 by the Swiss-born American portrait painter Adolfo Müller-Ury almost certainly on Hill&#x27;s behalf, which was exhibited at M. Knoedler &amp; Co., New York, January 1895 (lost) and again in 1897 (Archdiocesan Archives, Archdiocese of Saint Paul &amp; Minneapolis).

==Legacy==
The influence of his personality made Archbishop Ireland a commanding figure in many important movements, especially those for total abstinence, for colonization in the Northwest, and modern education. Ireland became a leading civic and religious leader during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Saint Paul. He worked closely with non-Catholics and was recognized by them as a leader of the Modernist Catholics.
Ireland called for racial equality at a time in the U.S. when the concept was considered extreme. On May 5, 1890, he gave a sermon at St. Augustine&#x27;s Church, in Washington, D.C., the center of an African-American parish, to a congregation that included several public officials, Congressmen including the full Minnesota delegation, U.S. Treasury Secretary William Windom, and Blanche Bruce, the second black U.S. Senator. Ireland&#x27;s sermon on racial justice concluded with the statement, &quot;The color line must go; the line will be drawn at personal merit.&quot; It was reported that &quot;the bold and outspoken stand of the Archbishop on this occasion created somewhat of a sensation throughout America.&quot;

===Colonization===

Disturbed by reports that Catholic immigrants in eastern cities were suffering from social and economic handicaps, Ireland and Bishop John Lancaster Spalding of the Diocese of Peoria, Illinois, founded the Irish Catholic Colonization Association. This organization bought land in rural areas to the west and south and helped resettle Irish Catholics from the urban slums.
Ireland helped establish many Irish Catholic colonies in Minnesota. The land had been cleared of its native Sioux following the Dakota War of 1862. He served as director of the National Colonization Association. From 1876 to 1881 Ireland organized and directed the most successful rural colonization program ever sponsored by the Catholic Church in the U.S. Working with the western railroads and with the Minnesota state government, he brought more than 4,000 Catholic families from the slums of eastern urban areas and settled them on more than of farmland in rural Minnesota.

His partner in Ireland was John Sweetman, a wealthy brewer who helped set up the Irish-American Colonisation Company there.

In 1880 Ireland assisted several hundred people from Connemara in Ireland to emigrate to Minnesota. They arrived at the wrong time of the year and had to be assisted by local Freemasons, an organisation that the Catholic Church condemns on many points. In the public debate that followed, the immigrants, being Connaught Irish monoglot speakers, could not voice their opinions of Bishop Ireland&#x27;s criticism of their acceptance of the Masons&#x27; support during a harsh winter. De Graff and Clontarf in Swift County, Adrian in Nobles County, Avoca, Iona and Fulda in Murray County, Graceville in Big Stone County and Ghent in Lyon County were all colonies established by Ireland.

Charlotte Grace O&#x27;Brien, philanthropist and activist for the protection of female emigrants, found that often the illiterate young women were being tricked into prostitution through spurious offers of employment. She proposed an information bureau at Castle Garden, the disembarkation point for immigrants arriving in New York; a temporary shelter to provide accommodation for immigrants, and a chapel, all to Archbishop Ireland, who she believed of all the American hierarchy would be most sympathetic. Ireland agreed to raise the matter at the May 1883 meeting of the Irish Catholic Association which endorsed the plan and voted to establish an information bureau at Castle Garden. The Irish Catholic Colonization Association was also instrumental in the establishment of the Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary for the Protection of Irish Immigrant Girls.

===Education===

Ireland advocated state support and inspection of Catholic schools. After several parochial schools were in danger of closing, Ireland sold them to the respective city&#x27;s board of education. The schools continued to operate with nuns and priests teaching, but no religious teaching was allowed. This plan, the Faribault–Stillwater plan, or Poughkeepsie plan, created enough controversy that Ireland was forced to travel to Vatican City to defend it, and he succeeded in doing so. He also supported the English only movement, which he sought to enforce within American Catholic churches and parochial schools. The continued use of heritage languages was not uncommon at the time because of the recent large influx of immigrants to the U.S. from European countries. Ireland influenced American society by actively demanding the immediate adoption of the English language by German-Americans and other recent immigrants. He is the author of &quot;The Church and Modern Society&quot; (1897).

According his biographers Fr. Vincent A. Yzermans and Franz Xaver Wetzel, there is a great historical importance to the well documented clashes between Rt.-Rev. John Joseph Frederick Otto Zardetti while Bishop of St. Cloud, with Archbishop John Ireland and his supporters within the American hierarchy. These clashes were both over Zardetti&#x27;s hostility to Archbishop Ireland&#x27;s Modernist theology and Zardetti&#x27;s belief that American patriotism was compatible with teaching and nurturing the German language in the United States and other heritage languages like it. Zardetti later played a major role, as an official of the Roman Curia, in pushing for the Apostolic letter &quot;Testem Benevolentiae&quot;, which was signed by Pope Leo XIII on 22 January 1899. As a reward, Zardetti was promoted to assistant to the papal throne on 14 February 1899. In commenting on Zardetti&#x27;s role in the letter, Fr. Yzermans has commented, &quot;In this arena he might well have had seen his greatest impact on American Catholicism in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.&quot;

===Relations with Eastern Catholics===

In 1891, Ireland refused to accept the clerical credentials of Byzantine Rite, Ruthenian Catholic priest Alexis Toth, despite Toth&#x27;s being a widower. Ireland then forbade Toth to minister to his own parishioners. Ireland was also involved in efforts to expel all non-Latin Church Catholic clergy from the United States. Forced into an impasse, Toth went on to lead thousands of Ruthenian Catholics out of the Roman Communion and into what would eventually become the Orthodox Church in America. Because of this, Archbishop Ireland is sometimes referred to, ironically, as &quot;The Father of the Orthodox Church in America&quot;. Marvin R. O&#x27;Connell, author of a biography of Ireland, summarizes the situation by stating that &quot;if Ireland&#x27;s advocacy of the blacks displayed him at his best, his belligerence toward the Uniates showed him at his bull-headed worst.&quot;

==Establishments==

At the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore the establishment of a Catholic university was decided. In 1885 Ireland was appointed to a committee, along with, Bishop John Lancaster Spalding, Cardinal James Gibbons and then bishop John Joseph Keane dedicated to developing and establishing The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Ireland retained an active interest in the university for the rest of his life.

He founded Saint Thomas Aquinas Seminary, progenitor of four institutions: University of Saint Thomas (Minnesota), the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity, Nazareth Hall Preparatory Seminary, and Saint Thomas Academy. The Saint Paul Seminary was established with the help of Methodist James J. Hill, whose wife, Mary Mehegan, was a devout Catholic. Both institutions are located on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. DeLaSalle High School located on Nicollet Island in Minneapolis was opened in October 1900 through a gift of $25,000 from Ireland. Fourteen years later Ireland purchased an adjacent property for the expanding Christian Brothers school.

In 1904 Ireland secured the land for the building of the current Cathedral of Saint Paul located atop Summit Hill, the highest point in downtown Saint Paul. At the same time, on Christmas Day 1903 he also commissioned the construction of the almost equally large Church of Saint Mary, for the Immaculate Conception parish in the neighboring city of Minneapolis. It became the Pro-Cathedral of Minneapolis and later became the Basilica of Saint Mary, the first basilica in the United States in 1926. Both were designed and built under the direction of the French architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray.

John Ireland Boulevard, a Saint Paul street that runs from the Cathedral of Saint Paul northeast to the Minnesota State Capitol, is named in his honor. It was so named in 1961 at the encouragement of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.

<doc id="964868" wikidata="Q885499" url="?curid=964868" title="Blowhole (geology)">
<text>In geology, a blowhole or marine geyser is formed as sea caves grow landward and upward into vertical shafts and expose themselves toward the surface, which can result in hydraulic compression of seawater that is released through a port from the top of the blowhole. The geometry of the cave and blowhole along with tide levels and swell conditions determine the height of the spray.

== Mechanics ==

Blowholes are likely to occur in areas where there are crevices, such as lava tubes, in rock along the coast. These areas are often located along fault lines and on islands. As powerful waves hit the coast, water rushes into these crevices and bursts out in a high pressured release. It is often accompanied by a loud noise and wide spray, and for this reason, blowholes are often sites of tourism.

Marine erosion on rocky coastlines produce blowholes that are found throughout the world. They are found at intersecting faults and on the windward sides of a coastline where they receive higher wave energy from the open ocean. The development of a blowhole is linked to the formation of a littoral cave. These two elements make up the blowhole system. A blowhole system always contains three main features: a catchment entrance, a compression cavern and an expelling port. The arrangement, angle and size of these three features determine the force of the air to water ratio that is ejected from the port. The blowhole feature tends to occur in the most distal section of a littoral cave. As their name suggests, blowholes have the ability to move air rapidly. Strong reverse draughts in response to pressure changes in a connecting littoral cave can send wind speeds upwards of 70 km/h.

The formation of a blowhole system begins as a littoral cave is formed. The main factors that contribute to littoral caves formation are wave dynamics and the parent material’s rock property. A parent material property such as susceptibility or resistance to weathering plays a major role in the development of caves. Littoral caves can be formed by one of two processes: caves made of limestone are produced by karst (dissolution) processes, and caves made of igneous rock are produced by pseudokarst (non-dissolutional) processes. In time the littoral cave enlarges growing inland and vertically through weak joints in the parent material. As weathering continues the roof of the cave is exposed, and the blowhole continues to enlarge, eventually the roof of the littoral cave is weaken and collapses. This creates a steep-wall inlet that allows the next stage of coastal morphology to progress. 

La Bufadora is a large example of a blowhole located in the Punta Banda Peninsula of Baja California, Mexico. It consists of a littoral cave with a thin opening that has a recurrence eruption interval of 13 -17 seconds, ejecting water up to 100 ft. above sea level.

== Ecological impacts ==

Blowholes have the capacity to change the topography near their locations. Blowholes can eventually erode the area surrounding the crevices to form larger sea caves. In some instances, the cave itself may collapse. This event may create shallow pools along the coast.

== Other ==

A &quot;blowhole&quot; is also the name of a rare geologic feature in which air is blown through a small hole at the surface due to pressure differences between a closed underground system and the surface. The blowholes of Wupatki National Monument are an example of such a phenomenon. It is estimated that the closed underground passages have a volume of at least seven billion cubic feet. Wind speeds can approach 30 miles per hour. Another well-known example of this kind of blowhole is the natural entrance to Wind Cave in South Dakota.

<text>Blood Duster are an Australian grindcore/stoner rock band from Melbourne. Their name comes from the song &quot;Blood Duster&quot; by John Zorn, from the 1990 album &quot;Naked City&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
The band was formed in 1991 by Jason Fuller (aka Jason PC) (bass), Anthony Barry (vocals and guitar), and Andrew Brown (drums). After completion of their first demo, Anthony Barry resigned and was replaced by Troy Darlington and Callum Wilson.

A self-released demo recording in 1992 was titled &quot;Menstrual Soup&quot;. By the time the band recorded their first EP, Wilson and Darlington had been replaced by Tony Forde, Shane Rout (who would later go on to form the NSBM band Abyssic Hate) and Brad Johnston.

===&quot;Fisting the Dead&quot; (1993)===

&quot;Fisting the Dead&quot;, the band&#x27;s debut, is a straightforward grindcore EP that featured 25 tracks, released in mid-1993. According to Rosemary Overell, &quot;They are largely credited with establishing Melbourne&#x27;s gore- and porno-grindcore aesthetic&quot;. The tracks were initially recorded for a proposed split album on the Wild Rags label with other tracks by Impetigo and Meat Shits. The track &quot;Derek&quot; refers to a character played by Peter Jackson in his 1987 cult film &quot;Bad Taste&quot;, which was &quot;heavily influenced by the late-&#x27;80s grindcore of such Earache label bands as Carcass and Napalm Death.&quot;

In 1996, the album was released in the US as bonus tracks on the U.S. CD issue of the group&#x27;s 1995 EP &quot;Yeest&quot;, on Relapse Records and Drug Bust Records. In 2001, it was reissued on vinyl with &quot;Yeest&quot; on the B-side.

In 2005, the album was reissued as &quot;Fisting the Dead... Again&quot; on bassist Jason Fuller&#x27;s label, with bonus tracks, on Goat Sounds Records.

In 2008, it was reissued on Stomp Records with &quot;Yeest&quot;, the compilation tracks, and live tracks from a gig at the Great Britain Hotel on 18 August 1993 as bonus tracks. AllMusic&#x27;s Tom Forget described the 2008 version: &quot;A noticeable splatter seems to accompany every spin of Blood Duster&#x27;s mammoth reissue&quot;. He felt that it &quot;traces the band&#x27;s early-90s grind heyday, before elements of Southern and stoner rock groove seeped into their toxic sound.&quot;

===1995–2000===
In 1995, Blood Duster released the EP &quot;Yeest&quot;, which started to show some more rock leanings. The band toured Australia including Canberra in November 1995.

The band next produced 1998&#x27;s &quot;Str8 Outta Northcote&quot;, which featured a bizarre combination of Southern rock riffs and blasting grindcore.

In 1998, Blood Duster again toured Australia with Brutal Truth, and recorded shows for a planned double live album. The next album, controversially entitled &quot;Cunt&quot;, was released worldwide in 2001 and saw Blood Duster returning to a more percussive-driven grind style. It was also around this time that the band appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Thunderbirds Are Coming Out&quot; by fellow Australian band TISM.

===2001–2017===
After touring with The Dwarves in 2001, Blood Duster released the &quot;Drink, Fight, Fuck&quot; EP, which featured the track &quot;66.6FMONYOURRADIODIAL&quot;, used in a television commercial for Reflex copying paper, along with three songs in the pre-gap.

The eponymous &quot;Blood Duster&quot; album was released in 2003 and featured special guests including original AC/DC singer Dave Evans, Jay Dunne from 28 Days, and all three members of Melbourne band The Spazzys. Two further singles were released from this album, &quot;IWannaDoItWithADonna&quot; in 2003 and &quot;SixSixSixteen&quot; in 2004.

Most of 2004 was spent touring Australia, first with the Big Day Out festival and then their own shows. Following tours with The Dwarves and Pungent Stench in early 2005, Blood Duster toured across Europe and Japan to promote the release of their first DVD, &quot;The Shape of Death to Come&quot;. In 2006, the band issued the live album &quot;Kill, Kill, Kill&quot; in a limited edition of 500 copies. The album was recorded in Sydney in 1996 during a tour with Brutal Truth.

In 2006, Blood Duster began pre-production for a proposed triple album consisting of a disc each of death metal, grind, and drone doom, with guest 1970s balladeer and actor Darryl Cotton. &quot;Lyden Nå&quot; (Norwegian for &quot;The Now Sound&quot;) was released in April 2007 as a double album, with the third disc available as additional downloadable content.

In October 2012, the group released &quot;KVLT&quot;, a vinyl album, which had been deliberately rendered unplayable; its producer Jason PC explained &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a statement piece ... We made the album, sat down and listened to it, thought: &#x27;Yep, that&#x27;s perfect, let&#x27;s wreck it&#x27;.&quot;

Blood Duster played their final show on 9 December 2017 at the Corner Hotel, Richmond.

On 4 December 2024, the band were announced as reforming to play the Blacken Open Air festival in Alice Springs between 19 and 22 September 2025. On the 23rd, they also announced an appearance at the Obscene Extreme festival in Czechia between 9 and 13 July.

<doc id="964888" wikidata="Q424238" url="?curid=964888" title="Domperidone">
<text>Domperidone, sold under the brand name Motilium among others, is a dopamine antagonist medication which is used to treat nausea and vomiting and certain gastrointestinal problems like gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying). It raises the level of prolactin in the human body and is used off label to induce and promote breast milk production. It may be taken by mouth or rectally.
Side effects may include headache, anxiety, dry mouth, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and elevated prolactin levels. Secondary to increased prolactin levels, breast changes, milk outflow, menstrual irregularities, and hypogonadism can occur. Domperidone may also cause QT prolongation and has rarely been associated with serious cardiac complications such as sudden cardiac death. However, the risks are small and occur more with high doses. Domperidone acts as a peripherally selective antagonist of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Due to its low entry into the brain, the side effects of domperidone are different from those of other dopamine receptor antagonists like metoclopramide and it produces little in the way of central nervous system adverse effects. However, domperidone can nonetheless increase prolactin levels as the pituitary gland is outside of the blood–brain barrier.
Domperidone was discovered in 1974 and was introduced for medical use in 1979. It was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica. Domperidone is available over-the-counter in many countries, for instance in Europe and elsewhere throughout the world. It is not approved for use in the United States. However, it is available in the United States for people with severe and treatment-refractory gastrointestinal motility problems under an expanded access individual-patient investigational new drug application. An analogue of domperidone called deudomperidone is under development for potential use in the United States and other countries.

==Medical uses==

=== Nausea and vomiting ===
There is some evidence that domperidone has antiemetic activity. It is recommended by the Canadian Headache Society for treatment of nausea associated with acute migraine.

===Gastroparesis===
Gastroparesis is a medical condition characterised by delayed emptying of the stomach when there is no mechanical gastric outlet obstruction. Its cause is most commonly idiopathic, a diabetic complication or a result of abdominal surgery. The condition causes nausea, vomiting, fullness after eating, early satiety (feeling full before the meal is finished), abdominal pain, and bloating. Domperidone can be used to increase the transit of food through the stomach by increasing gastrointestinal peristalsis and hence to treat gastroparesis. It may be useful in idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis. However, increased rate of gastric emptying induced by drugs like domperidone does not always correlate well with relief of symptoms.

===Lactation===
Domperidone is used off-label in some countries to stimulate lactation or enhance breast milk production, but, as of December 2023, it is not approved for that purpose in any country, and is not approved for use in humans in the United States. Domperidone acts as a peripheral dopamine antagonist and is hypothesized to stimulate prolactin secretion, with a 2003 study supporting that hypothesis.

A 2018 meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found that domperidone resulted in a moderate increase of in breast milk volume for mothers of preterm infants with insufficient milk supply. The analysis also indicated that domperidone was well tolerated with no significant difference in maternal adverse events compared to placebo. Domperidone has no officially established dosage for increasing milk supply, but most published studies have used 10 mg three times daily for 4 to 10 days (30 mg per day).

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expressed concerns about serious adverse side effects and concerns about its effectiveness. The FDA identified serious cardiac adverse events associated with domperidone use in lactating individuals, including arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Additionally, discontinuation or tapering of domperidone has been linked to severe neuropsychiatric adverse events such as agitation, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Because of these risks, the FDA strongly cautions against the use of domperidone to enhance lactation.

A review by Health Canada also found a link between the sudden discontinuation or tapering of domperidone when used off-label for lactation, and psychiatric withdrawal events, particularly daily doses greater than the maximum recommended dose of 30 mg per day. A 2021 study found that postpartum usage of domperidone increased across five Canadian provinces from 2004 and 2017 with usage plateauing in 2011 and a drop in usage after a 2012 Health Canada advisory warning about domperidone.

===Other uses===

====Parkinson&#x27;s disease====
Parkinson&#x27;s disease is a degenerative neurological condition where a decrease in dopamine in the brain leads to rigidity (stiffness of movement), tremor, and other symptoms and signs. Poor gastrointestinal function, nausea, and vomiting are major problems for people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease because most medications used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease are given by mouth. These medications, such as levodopa, can also cause nausea as a side effect. Furthermore, anti-nausea drugs, such as metoclopramide, which do cross the blood–brain barrier, may worsen the extrapyramidal symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Domperidone can be used to relieve nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson&#x27;s disease; it blocks peripheral D2 receptors but minimally crosses the blood-brain barrier in normal doses, so has no effect on the extrapyramidal symptoms of the disease. In addition, domperidone may be useful in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension caused by dopaminergic therapy in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

====Other gastrointestinal uses====
Domperidone may be used in functional dyspepsia in both adults and children. It has also been found effective in the treatment of reflux in children. However some specialists consider its risks prohibitory of the treatment of infantile reflux.

===Available forms===
Domperidone is available for use by oral administration in the form of tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) and suspension, and by rectal administration in the form of suppositories. The oral tablets are available in the strength of 10mg. Domperidone has been studied for use by intramuscular injection and an intravenous formulation was previously available, but the medication is now only available in forms for oral and rectal administration.

==Veterinary uses==
Domperidone is used as immunotherapy to treat leishmania in dogs.

Domperidone also has an FDA-approved formulation for the prevention of fescue toxicosis in periparturient mares.

==Contraindications==
Domperidone is contraindicated with QT-prolonging drugs like amiodarone.

==Side effects==
Side effects associated with domperidone include dry mouth, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, rash, itching, hives, and hyperprolactinemia (the symptoms of which may include breast enlargement, galactorrhea, breast pain/tenderness, gynecomastia, hypogonadism, and menstrual irregularities).

Due to the blockade of D2 receptors in the central nervous system, D2 receptor antagonists like metoclopramide and antipsychotics can also produce a variety of additional side effects including drowsiness, akathisia, restlessness, insomnia, lassitude, fatigue, extrapyramidal symptoms, dystonia, Parkinsonian symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and depression. However, this is not the case with domperidone, because, unlike other D2 receptor antagonists, it minimally crosses the blood–brain barrier, and for this reason, is rarely associated with such side effects. However, domperidone theoretically might be able to produce some blockade of central D2 receptors at higher doses, in turn producing side effects similar to those of centrally permeable D2 receptor antagonists like antipsychotics.

===Elevated prolactin levels===
Due to D2 receptor blockade, domperidone causes hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia can suppress the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, in turn suppressing the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and resulting in hypogonadism and low levels of the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone. Accordingly, 10 to 15% of females have been reported to experience mammoplasia (breast enlargement), mastodynia (breast pain/tenderness), galactorrhea (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), and amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles) with domperidone therapy. Males may experience low libido, erectile dysfunction, and impaired spermatogenesis, as well as galactorrhea and gynecomastia. D2 receptor antagonists like antipsychotics and domperidone may also increase the risk of prolactinomas, but more research is needed to confirm this.

===Rare reactions===

====Cardiac complications====
Domperidone use is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (by 70%) most likely through its prolonging effect of the cardiac QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias. The cause is thought to be blockade of hERG voltage-gated potassium channels. The risks are dose-dependent, and appear to be greatest with high/very high doses via intravenous administration and in the elderly, as well as with drugs that interact with domperidone and increase its circulating concentrations (namely CYP3A4 inhibitors). Conflicting reports exist, however. In neonates and infants, QT prolongation is controversial and uncertain.

UK drug regulatory authorities (MHRA) have issued the following restriction on domperidone in 2014 due to increased risk of adverse cardiac effects:

However, a 2015 Australian review concluded the following:

====Possible central toxicity in infants====
In Britain, a legal case involved the death of two children of a mother whose three children had all had hypernatraemia. She was charged with poisoning the children with salt. One of the children, who was born at 28 weeks gestation with respiratory complications and had a fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive was prescribed domperidone. An advocate for the mother suggested the child may have had neuroleptic malignant syndrome as a side effect of domperidone due to the drug crossing the child&#x27;s immature blood–brain barrier.

== Interactions ==

In healthy volunteers, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased the Cmax and AUC concentrations of domperidone by 3- to 10-fold. This was accompanied by a QT interval prolongation of about 10–20 milliseconds when domperidone 10 mg four times daily and ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily were administered, whereas domperidone by itself at the dosage assessed produced no such effect. As such, domperidone with ketoconazole or other CYP3A4 inhibitors is a potentially dangerous combination.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Domperidone is a peripherally selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It has no clinically significant interaction with the D1 receptor, unlike metoclopramide. The medication provides relief from nausea by blocking D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and from gastrointestinal symptoms by blocking D2 receptors in the gut. It blocks D2 receptors in the lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland increasing release of prolactin which in turn increases lactation. Domperidone may be more useful in some patients and cause harm in others by way of the genetics of the person, such as polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene &quot;ABCB1&quot; (which encodes P-glycoprotein), the voltage-gated potassium channel &quot;KCNH2&quot; gene (hERG/Kv11.1), and the α1D-adrenergic receptor &quot;ADRA1D&quot; gene.

====Effects on prolactin levels====
A single 20 mg oral dose of domperidone has been found to increase mean serum prolactin levels (measured 90 minutes post-administration) in non-lactating women from 8.1 ng/mL to 110.9 ng/mL (a 13.7-fold increase). This was similar to the increase in prolactin levels produced by a single 20 mg oral dose of metoclopramide (7.4 ng/mL to 124.1 ng/mL; 16.7-fold increase). After two weeks of repeated administration (30 mg/day in both cases), the increase in prolactin levels produced by domperidone was reduced (53.2 ng/mL; 6.6-fold above baseline), but the increase in prolactin levels produced by metoclopramide, conversely, was heightened (179.6 ng/mL; 24.3-fold above baseline). This indicates that acute and continuous administration of both domperidone and metoclopramide is effective in increasing prolactin levels, but that there are different effects on the secretion of prolactin with repeated use. The mechanism of the difference is unknown. The increase in prolactin levels observed with the two drugs was much greater in women than in men. This appears to be due to the higher estrogen levels in women, as estrogen stimulates prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland.

For comparison, normal prolactin levels in women are less than 20 ng/mL, prolactin levels peak at 100 to 300 ng/mL at parturition in pregnant women, and in lactating women, prolactin levels have been found to be 90 ng/mL at 10 days postpartum and 44 ng/mL at 180 days postpartum.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Absorption====
The absolute bioavailability of domperidone is low (13–17% or approximately 15%). This is due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Conversely, its bioavailability is high via intramuscular injection (90%). The onset of action of domperidone taken orally is about 30 to 60 minutes. Peak levels of domperidone following an oral dose occur after about 60 minutes. Domperidone exposure increases proportionally with doses in the 10 to 20 mg dose range. There is a 2- to 3-fold accumulation in levels of domperidone with frequent repeated oral administration of domperidone (four times per day (every 5 hours) for 4 days). The oral bioavailability of domperidone is somewhat increased, and time to peak slightly increased when it is taken with food and bioavailability is decreased by prior concomitant administration of cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate.

====Distribution====
The plasma protein binding of domperidone is 91 to 93%. The tissue distribution of domperidone based on animal studies is wide, but concentrations are low in the brain. The drug is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter, and animal studies suggest that this is the reason for the low central nervous system penetration of domperidone. Small amounts of domperidone cross the placenta in animals.

====Metabolism====
Domperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver and intestines with oral administration. This occurs via hydroxylation and N-dealkylation. Domperidone is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4/5, though minor contributions by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 have been reported. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the N-dealkylation of domperidone, while CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 are involved in its aromatic hydroxylation. All of the metabolites of domperidone are inactive as D2 receptor ligands. Overall and peak levels of domperidone are increased by about 2.9- and 1.5-fold in moderate hepatic impairment, respectively.

====Elimination====
Domperidone is eliminated 31% in urine and 66% in feces. The proportion of domperidone excreted unchanged is small (10% in feces and 1% in urine). The elimination half-life of domperidone is about 7 to 9 hours in healthy individuals. However, the elimination half-life of domperidone can be prolonged to 20 hours in people with severe renal dysfunction.

==Chemistry==
Domperidone is a derivative of benzimidazolinone. It is structurally related to butyrophenone neuroleptics like haloperidol.

==History==
Domperidone was synthesized at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1974 following their research on antipsychotic drugs. Janssen pharmacologists discovered that some antipsychotic drugs had a significant effect on dopamine receptors in the central chemoreceptor trigger zone that regulated vomiting, and started searching for a dopamine antagonist that would not pass the blood–brain barrier, thereby being free of the extrapyramidal side effects that were associated with drugs of this type. This led to the discovery of domperidone as a strong antiemetic with minimal central effects. Domperidone was patented in the United States in 1978, with the patent filed in 1976. In 1979, domperidone was first marketed, under the brand name Motilium, in Switzerland and West Germany. Domperidone was subsequently introduced in the forms of orally disintegrating tablets (based on Zydis technology) in 1999.

In April 2014, the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures – Human (CMDh) published an official press release suggesting restricting the use of domperidone-containing medicines. It also approved earlier published suggestions by Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to use domperidone only for treating nausea and vomiting and reduce maximum daily dosage to 10mg.

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
&quot;Domperidone&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and .

===Regulatory approval===
It was reported in 2007 that domperidone is available in 58 countries, but the uses or &quot;indications&quot; of domperidone vary between nations. In Italy it is used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and in Canada, the drug is indicated in upper gastrointestinal motility disorders and to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the use of dopamine agonist antiparkinsonian agents. In the United Kingdom, domperidone is only indicated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting and the treatment duration is usually limited to 1 week.

In the United States, domperidone is not a legally marketed human drug and it is not approved for sale in the United States. In June 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that distributing any domperidone-containing products is illegal.

It is available over-the-counter to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional dyspepsia in many countries, such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, South Africa, Mexico, India, Chile, and China.

Domperidone is not approved for use in the United States. There is an exception for use in people with treatment-refractory gastrointestinal symptoms under an FDA Investigational New Drug application.

===Formulations===
==Research==
Domperidone has been studied as a potential hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women.

<doc id="964889" wikidata="Q1641669" url="?curid=964889" title="Mama Said (album)">
<text>Mama Said is the second studio album by American rock musician Lenny Kravitz, released in April 1991 by Virgin Records. Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash co-wrote and played on the song &quot;Always on the Run&quot;. He also played on the song &quot;Fields of Joy&quot;. The song &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; was co-written by Sean Lennon.

Although the album has sold enough copies to be certified double platinum, the RIAA still has it listed as platinum. In the UK, the album reached number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2012, Virgin Records released an expanded, double-disc version of the album with a number of remixes and bonus tracks.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rather than synthesizing his influences in a way that allows him some personal expression,&quot; wrote Elysa Gardner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Kravitz seemingly aims to acknowledge as many of them as he can in the course of an hour; the result is a rather disjointed album that lacks freshness and distinction. Kravitz continues to demonstrate a talent for crafting and arranging engaging songs; unfortunately, up to this point it has proven less a creative talent than a recreative one.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot opined that &quot;until Kravitz begins transforming his influences instead of just copying them, he&#x27;ll remain a promising but minor artist.&quot; Phil Sutcliffe was more positive in &quot;Q&quot;, finding that Kravitz, while &quot;not so much influenced as tie-dyed to the bone by the late &#x27;60s&quot;, sounds &quot;truly inspired&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau commented, &quot;don&#x27;t think Hendrix–Beatles, think Prince–George Michael&quot;, later giving the album a &quot;two-star honorable mention&quot; grade.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that Kravitz had downplayed &quot;some of the joy that informed &quot;Let Love Rule&quot;&quot; in favor of a &quot;more polished and studied&quot; sound on &quot;Mama Said&quot;, which he deemed &quot;another thoroughly enjoyable guilty pleasure... it doesn&#x27;t really matter that it&#x27;s talking loud and saying nothing, because it sounds good while it&#x27;s talking.&quot; Writing for &quot;Record Collector&quot;, Terry Staunton found it &quot;even more accomplished&quot; than its predecessor: &quot;Rarely had traditional guitar rock and sweet soul merged so confidently, so effortlessly: further proof that we were in the midst of a major talent.&quot;

<doc id="964897" wikidata="Q567372" url="?curid=964897" title="Jacques Lusseyran">
<text>Jacques Lusseyran (19 September 1924 – 27 July 1971) was a French author and political activist. Blinded at the age of 7, at 17 Lusseyran became a leader in the French resistance against Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of France in 1941. He was eventually sent to Buchenwald concentration camp because of his involvement, and was one of 990 of his group of 2000 inmates to survive. He wrote about his life, including his experience during the war, in his autobiography &quot;And There Was Light&quot;.

== Life ==
Lusseyran was born in Paris, France. He became totally blind in a school accident at the age of 7. He soon learned to adapt to being blind and maintained many close friendships, particularly with one boy named Jean Besniée. At a young age he became alarmed at the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany and decided to learn the German language so that he could listen to German radio broadcasts. By 1938, when Nazi Germany annexed Austria, he had accomplished this task.

Germany invaded France in 1940. In the spring of 1941, at the age of 17, Lusseyran formed a Resistance group called the Volunteers of Liberty with other students from the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the Lycée Henri-IV. He was put in charge of recruitment. The group later merged with another Resistance group called Défense de la France. In July 1943 he participated in a campaign to drop pro-resistance leaflets on trains: forty squads of ten members each passed out seventy thousand leaflets. The squads carried tear gas pens to stop people from interfering, though these were never used, and there were no arrests.

On July 20, 1943, Lusseyran was arrested by the Gestapo, betrayed by a member of his resistance group named Elio. His knowledge of German helped him understand more of the situation than most French prisoners. He spent six months at Fresnes prison before being moved to Buchenwald concentration camp with 2000 other French citizens, where, because he was blind, he did not have to participate in forced labor as most other prisoners did. Soon most of his childhood friends and fellow resistance operatives were arrested, and he met some of them in the concentration camp. Lusseyran helped to motivate a spirit of resistance within the camp, particularly within the French and German prisoners.

In April 1945, he was liberated; 990 of his group of 2000 inmates survived. After the war, Lusseyran taught French literature in the United States and wrote books, including the autobiographical &quot;And There Was Light&quot;, which chronicles the first 20 years of his life. He died together with his third wife Marie in a car accident in France on July 27, 1971.

<doc id="964898" wikidata="Q7269897" url="?curid=964898" title="Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift">
<text>In recent years, Peru has revised the official spelling for place-names originating from Aymara and the Quechuan languages. A standardized alphabet for done Quechua was adopted by the Peruvian government in 1975; a revision in 1985 moved to a three-vowel orthography.

The major changes are to replace the digraph with the single letter , and to replace the consonants &quot;c&quot;/&quot;q[u]&quot; with either or , as appropriate in the word in question. &quot;K&quot; and &quot;q&quot; represent different sounds in most Andean languages: k is a velar stop , as in Spanish and English; q is a uvular stop . As Spanish does not have uvular , traditional spellings lose this distinction (although sometimes a double &quot;cc&quot; was used to represent the k-like sounds of Quechua that differed from the &quot;plain k&quot; sound known in Spanish; e.g., in place names such as Ccarhuacc, Chopcca, Cconocc, Llacce, Manyacc, Chihuilluyocc, Chilcahuaycco, etc.), and Quechua or Aymara sources must be consulted to select the right consonant. For instance, the Temple of the Sun in Cusco is called the &quot;Qurikancha&quot; in Quechua, with both sounds (&quot;quri&quot; &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;kancha&quot; &quot;courtyard, enclosure&quot;), and is spelled &quot;Coricancha&quot; in hispanicized spelling.

Additionally, the phoneme inventory of Quechua and Aymara includes just three vowels, , , and . Older Spanish transcriptions (as well as the 1975 standard) used the letters and as well; this is because the pronunciation of and opens to and adjacent to a , an instance of allophonic variation. For instance, Quechua &quot;qucha&quot; &#x27;lake&#x27; sounds to Spanish speakers like &quot;cocha&quot;, as in the sample &quot;Huiracocha&quot; below. Some sources, such as dictionary published by the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, still use the five-vowel 1975 orthography.

In Bolivia and Southern Peru, including Cuzco, there are three versions of all the stop consonants: the basic unaspirated sounds (&quot;p, t, ch, k, q&quot;), an aspirated series spelled with an &quot;h&quot; (&quot;ph, th, chh, kh, qh&quot;); and finally an ejective series spelled with an apostrophe (&quot;p&#x27;, t&#x27;, ch&#x27;, k&#x27;, q″&quot;). In Aymara and Southern Quechua, these are distinct sounds, making a total of 15 stop consonants, and these differences must be shown in the spelling: in the example words below, the &quot;kh&quot; in &quot;khipu&quot; is not the same as the &quot;k&quot; in &quot;Inka&quot; or in &quot;Tiwanaku&quot;; nor is the &quot;qh&quot; sound at the start of &quot;qhapaq&quot; the same as the &quot;q&quot; sound at the start of &quot;Qusqu&quot;. In most regions north of Cusco, these variants do not exist, and only the basic unaspirated sounds are used.

These changes are considered to be part of a general process of spelling standardisation and reassertion of the right of these native languages to their own spelling system appropriate for their sound systems, which are very different from that of Spanish. This accompanies a growth of pride in the Andean heritage of these countries, and moves to recover the prestige of their indigenous languages. These spelling changes are part of the official alphabets for Quechua and Aymara in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, though debate continues on the extent to which they are to be used when writing in Spanish.

== Regulations ==
Today the Spanish spellings are in conflict with Peruvian law. According to Article 20 of &quot;Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC&quot; (Supreme Decree) which approves the Regulations to Law 29735, published in the official newspaper &quot;El Peruano&quot; on July 22, 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalized alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed with the aim of standardizing the namings used by the National Geographic Institute &quot;(Instituto Geográfico Nacional, IGN)&quot;. The &quot;IGN&quot; realizes the necessary changes in the official maps of Peru.

The following table shows examples of modern spellings of Aymara and Quechua expressions according to the normalized alphabets, their meanings and common Spanish spellings.

Quechuan and Aymaran Wikipedias are also a good example of using of the modern spelling.

<text>Directorate of Civil Resistance (Polish &quot;Kierownictwo Walki Cywilnej&quot;, short KWC) was one of the branches of the Polish Government Delegate&#x27;s Office during World War II. Its main tasks were to maintain the morale of the Polish society, encourage passive resistance, report German atrocities and cruelties to the Polish Government in Exile, and to organize sabotage. In addition, it was responsible for the law and justice in occupied Poland.

It organized trials of traitors, collaborators and provocateurs as well as the most cruel members of the Wehrmacht, Gestapo and SS. The verdicts varied from boycott, fines, and lash to capital punishment. The trials were carried out by civil Underground court and the verdicts were enforced by the Państwowy Korpus Bezpieczeństwa. From 1942 on, the KWC also prosecuted crimes such as theft, rape, and murder.

The KWC was headed by Stefan Korboński. In 1943 it was joined with Directorate of Covert Resistance and formed the Directorate of Underground Resistance.

<text>Neutral Bay is a suburb on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Neutral Bay is around 1.5 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of North Sydney Council.

Neutral Bay takes its name from the bay on Sydney Harbour. Kurraba Point, formerly a locality in Neutral Bay, was declared a separate suburb in 2010, sharing the postcode 2089. Surrounding suburbs include North Sydney, Cammeray, Milsons Point, Cremorne and Cremorne Point.&lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;-33.825364&quot; longitude=&quot;151.180801&quot; zoom=&quot;12&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

&lt;/mapframe&gt;

==History==
The name &quot;Neutral Bay&quot; originates from the time of the early colonial period of Australia, where different bays of Sydney harbour were zoned for different incoming vessels. This bay was where all foreign vessels would dock, hence the name &quot;neutral&quot;.

The Aboriginal name for the area was &#x27;Wirra-birra&#x27;. In 1789, soon after the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney, Governor Arthur Phillip declared this bay a &quot;neutral harbour&quot; where foreign ships could anchor and take on water and supplies. Neutral Bay was far enough away from Sydney Cove to discourage convicts from escaping on these vessels and to keep possible enemy ships at a distance from the main settlement.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Neutral Bay and Cremorne were developing as &quot;alternative society suburbs&quot;, populated by the kind of people who were attracted to the Arts and Crafts architectural style that was in vogue at the time. This style was an attempt to get away from mass production and give homes the &quot;human touch&quot;. Notable examples soon appeared in the area. &quot;Brent Knowle&quot;, in Shellcove Road (now part of Kurraba Point), was designed by Bertrand James Waterhouse and built in 1914. It influenced home design in the area for at least the next fifteen years and has a state heritage listing.

A different style was used for &quot;The Cobbles&quot; (now in Kurraba Point), also in Shellcove Road. Designed by Peddle and Thorp and built in 1918, it made great use of natural stones and pebbles to achieve the desired look. It is an Australian interpretation of the California Bungalow style and has a state heritage listing. &quot;The Gables&quot;, in Spruson Street, was another Waterhouse design and was built in 1920. It was influenced by the &quot;shingle style&quot; which was brought to Sydney by Horbury Hunt, and featured prominent gables and extensive use of shingles. More Waterhouse designs appeared in Shellcove Road in the vicinity of &quot;The Cobbles&quot; and &quot;Brent Knowle&quot; (now in Kurraba Point). An outstanding example is &quot;Ailsa&quot; (now in Kurraba Point), which was designed by Waterhouse for Captain Robert Craig and built in 1908. It has a state heritage listing. Along with &quot;Keynsham&quot; (now in Kurraba Point), &quot;St Anne&#x27;s&quot; (now in Kurraba Point), and &quot;Gundimaine House&quot; (now in Kurraba Point), these homes form a significant heritage group and have a state heritage listing.

Neutral Bay was also the home of the English-born children&#x27;s author and painter May Gibbs, who lived for a time in &quot;Derry&quot;, a two-storey Federation home in Phillips Street. Afterwards, she moved to the home Nutcote in nearby Kurraba Point.

Neutral Bay was the location of the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s Submarine Service HMAS Platypus (naval base) between 18 August 1967 and 29 March 1999. It was home to the HMA Oberon submarines, with the first HMAS Oxley arriving at the site on the same day as the commissioning. During World War 2 the site was converted for use as the RAN Torpedo Maintenance Establishment (RANTME).

== Heritage listings ==
Neutral Bay has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 2 Hayes Street: &quot;Hastings&quot; (Neutral Bay)

The main shopping district of Neutral Bay, known as Neutral Bay Junction, is along Military Road, which is the main road that runs through Neutral Bay, Cremorne and Mosman. It features many shops, restaurants and cafes. The Big Bear shopping centre is a shopping mall that features a supermarket and grocery shops. Keolis Downer Northern Beaches&#x27; North Sydney Bus Depot is located behind the Big Bear.

The Oaks Hotel is a well-known and popular venue located on the corner of Military Road and Ben Boyd Road. It has been a popular meeting place in Sydney since 1885. The Oaks Hotel features a number of restaurants, bars, function rooms and a beer garden with the main focal point an old oak tree.

==Transport==
At the 2016 census, 39.2% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 36.4% by car (either as driver or as passenger).

The Neutral Bay wharf sits at the end of Hayes Street and it is serviced by both public Neutral Bay ferry services and private ferries.

The Warringah Freeway runs along the western border of Neutral Bay, providing links south to the Sydney CBD and north to Chatswood. Military Road has been a prominent local electoral issue, due to issues relating to the heavy traffic congestion on the road.

<text>Directorate of Covert Resistance (Polish &quot;Kierownictwo Walki Konspiracyjnej&quot;, short KWK) was one of the departments of the Armia Krajowa Headquarters created in Poland in 1942 during World War II. Its main task was commanding the so-called &quot;current fight&quot;. It included propaganda, organization of self-defence units, sabotage and diversion.

It was headed personally by the commander of the Armia Krajowa. The advisory body was composed of the commander of KeDyw, chief of Bureau of Information and Propaganda and an envoy of Directorate of Civil Resistance. In 1943 it was joined with the latter organization and formed the Directorate of Underground Resistance.

<doc id="964929" wikidata="Q1949842" url="?curid=964929" title="MTV Unplugged (Alanis Morissette album)">
<text>MTV Unplugged is the first live album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 9, 1999 (see 1999 in music). It comprises songs performed by Morissette on the television program &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. Twelve tracks were included on the album, but Morissette also performed &quot;Baba&quot;, &quot;Thank U&quot; (both from 1998&#x27;s &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;) and &quot;Your House&quot; (the hidden track on 1995&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;) during the live taping. These were later released as B-sides on the &quot;King of Pain&quot; single release. The first single, &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;, was moderately successful, and two other tracks, &quot;King of Pain&quot; (a cover of the song by The Police) and &quot;You Learn&quot; were released as singles outside North America. As of March 2012, the album has sold 673,000 copies in the U.S.

In addition to material from Morissette&#x27;s first two U.S. albums, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; featured performances of &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot; and &quot;Princes Familiar&quot;, two previously unreleased songs from her tours, and &quot;These R the Thoughts&quot;, a previously released b-side. Morissette has stated that &quot;Princes Familiar&quot; in particular is one of her favorite and most vocally challenging songs. She performed it on her 2005 Diamond Wink Tour, where she dedicated it to &quot;all of the dads in the audience.&quot; The ballad &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot;, one of the first songs she wrote following the release of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, &quot;was inspired by [her] twin brother,&quot; Wade.

Featuring cleaner vocals, slower arrangements and a few drastic reinventions (particularly in the case of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;), &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; foreshadowed much of Morissette&#x27;s later, softer work, particularly 2005&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot; and the accompanying Diamond Wink Tour.

<doc id="964930" wikidata="Q3193551" url="?curid=964930" title="Karole Armitage">
<text>Karole Armitage (born March 3, 1954) is an American dancer and choreographer currently based in New York City. She is artistic director of Armitage Gone! Dance, a contemporary dance company that performs several times annually in New York City as well as touring internationally. She was dubbed the “punk ballerina” in the 1980s. She earned a Tony nomination for her choreography of the Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot;.

==Early life and early career==
Born in Madison, Wisconsin, Armitage grew up dividing her time in two places: Gothic, Colorado, and Lawrence, Kansas. Gothic was the site of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory where her father, a biologist, did research. Armitage began studying ballet in Lawrence, Kansas at the age of four with former New York City Ballet dancer Tomi Wortham, followed by classes in Crested Butte, Colorado with Shirley Strabhaur. She then continued her studies with Ballet West in Aspen and Salt Lake City, at the School of American Ballet, the Harkness House in New York City, at North Carolina School of the Arts, and with Léonide Massine in London.

Armitage began her professional career in 1973 as a member of the Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève in Switzerland. The company, directed by George Balanchine and Patricia Neary, was rooted in the Balanchine aesthetic and devoted exclusively to his repertory. There she performed many Balanchine masterworks including Agon, The Four Temperaments and Serenade. In 1975 she became a Swiss citizen and holds dual citizenship with the US. From 1976 to 1981 she was a member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company performing leading roles across the globe.

In 1978, she created her first piece &quot;Ne&quot;, then followed by the iconic &quot;Drastic-Classicism&quot; in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, Armitage led her own company, which was based in New York City. Her company toured internationally and was known for its collaborations with artists David Salle and Jeff Koons. In 1984, she was invited by Mikhail Baryshnikov to create a work for the American Ballet Theatre. Three years later, Rudolph Nureyev commissioned one of her works for the Paris Opéra Ballet. She created five ballets for the Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra National de Paris during the 1980s, leading to commissions in the US and Europe which she pursued throughout the 1990s.

Armitage was named artistic director and choreographer of MaggioDanza (1995–1998) the ballet company at the Opera House in Florence, Italy, where she choreographed, curated and presented classical repertoire, modern masters and contemporary works.

She was named resident choreographer of the Ballet de Lorraine in Nancy, France, in 1999, where she remained until 2002, creating over 20 works for the company that toured throughout Europe.

In 2004, she served as the artistic director of the Venice Biennale International Festival of Contemporary Dance, inviting companies from across the globe to showcase innovative dance throughout the city including in the Arsenale where the Art Biennale is held every two years.

==Armitage GONE! Dance==
Returning to New York City after 15 years abroad, Armitage founded her current company, Armitage Gone! Dance in 2004 as a way to create a culture with like-minded dancers exploring new ideas of what dance can do and be. [3] It is administered by the Armitage Foundation a 501 (c) not- for-profit foundation based in New York City.

Armitage Gone! Dance has a home at Mana Contemporary, which is based in a vast former tobacco warehouse.

==Choreographic style==

Armitage is renowned for pushing boundaries to create works that blend dance, music, science, and art to engage in philosophical questions about the search for meaning. Armitage movement looks spontaneous despite its rigorous craftsmanship. Concepts such as “cubism in motion” are applied to group patterns, creating several vantage points so that movement is seen from multiple perspectives, angles, and levels, with planes bleeding into each other. The steps are based on calligraphy and fractal geometry (that of clouds, mountains, seashores), creating a sinuous, curvilinear vocabulary unlike the Euclidean geometry of dance tradition. The dancers share a common purpose but do not dance in unison, producing a funky, democratic individuality with lyricism punctuated by raw, visceral accents.

She is inspired by disparate, non-narrative sources, from 20th century physics, to 16th century Florentine fashion, to pop culture and new media. In her hands, the classic vocabulary is given a needed shock to its system, with speed, fractured lines, abstractions and symmetry countermanded by asymmetry. Music is her script and she has collaborated with contemporary and experimentalist composers such as John Luther Adams, Thomas Adès, Rhys Chatham, Vijay Iyer, and Lukas Ligeti. The scores can be marked by extreme lyricism as well as dissonance, noise and polyrhythms The sets and costumes for her works are often designed by leading artists in the contemporary art world, including Karen Kilimnik, Jeff Koons, Vera Lutter, David Salle, Phillip Taaffe and Brice Marden. She has also collaborated with fashion designers Christian Lacroix, Jean-Paul Gaultier, and Peter Speliopoulos with whom she has created many works. Film director James Ivory created sets and costumes for an evening of her choreography that was performed in Italy&#x27;s historic Teatro della Pergola, built in 1656.

Armitage&#x27;s choreography can be divided into three distinct, aesthetic periods: punk, picture, and poetry&quot;

===Punk===

Armitage joins a long lineage of artists looking at the past at the same time as they seek to dismantle it. Her early work fused Merce Cunningham&#x27;s aesthetics with an ebullient, joyous, punk-inspired jubilation in destroying the old to bring in the new. The work not only challenged formal notions of dance, but its imagery and content heralded the rise of themes relating to sexuality and gender that became so important in late 20thand early 21st Century discourse. She changed the idea of the ballerina, portraying her as independent thinker with an erotic appetite, rather than as an unobtainable, romantic ideal. In 1980 she put a man in a skirt on the stage as a matter of fact, rather than as drag.

In 1982, Armitage was inspired to examine her roots as a classical ballet dancer after creating three new works for the Paris Opera Ballet at the invitation of Rosella Hightower and Rudolph Nureyev. She combined Balanchine&#x27;s poetic refinement and brilliant phrase making with Cunningham&#x27;s use of stage space as a field of action. Her controversial recipe combining the warring factions of ballet and modern dance injected with hard rock energy and the taboo of sexual content, gave dance a much needed shock to its systems with speed, fractured lines, off-balance movement, abstractions and symmetry countermanded by asymmetry and punch.

===Picture===

In 1984 Armitage met painter, David Salle, at a post performance dinner that included the choreographer, Yvonne Rainer. The meeting led to the second period in Armitage&#x27;s aesthetic development as Armitage and Salle began a collaboration that continues to this day. Salle&#x27;s work, combining figuration with an extremely varied pictorial language, brought dazzlingly original sets and costumes to the stage. The early Armitage/Salle collaborations were made in a free-spirited exploration of style, eras, pluralities and comparatives, embracing the contamination of languages in a mosaic of pattern. The divisions between ballet and modern, high and low, serious and banal disappeared through collage, juxtaposition and humor. Armitage and her dancers performed to spoken text, classical and popular music, jazz, world music and silence. Exploring American identity from the perspective of a culture using everything to sell products, Armitage and Salle&#x27;s stage work created a contemplative universe awash in color. Though Armitage found consumer culture&#x27;s influence on the creation of self disturbing, her collaboration with Salle was done, not in the spirit of the social critique, but in the spirit of the artist struggling for form, for the new, for the experimental.

Jeff Koons joined Salle in designing several Armitage productions. The first collaboration in 1988 resulted in Gogo Ballerina for which Koons and Salle shared the costume design while Koons created sets. Armitage worked closely with Koons discussing themes and content for the new work, inspiring the creation of large, interactive sets for the piece. Her dancers used them physically: emerging from a black, heart-shaped chocolate box, dancing on illuminated gogo boxes with red plexiglas bears, hearts, and flowers and breaking apart a large, extravagant cake. The Koons sets were destroyed in the early 2000s when the expense of storage became prohibitive. Salle and Koons worked together again in 1989 on &quot;Contempt, Overboard&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Predators’ Ball/Hucksters of the Soul&quot; (1996) where both contributed set and costumes.

===Poetry===

In 1995 Armitage was invited to direct the Ballet of Florence, Italy (known as MaggioDanza). The influence of Italian history, politics and aesthetics, living on the streets of Dante and Machiavelli, led to a third, poetic, period in Armitage&#x27;s artistic thinking. She began to work with a minimum of ingredients to engage in philosophical questions about the search for meaning. Her ideas continued to develop while living in Naples working for the Teatro di San Carlo and in Venice where she directed the Venice International Biennale of Contemporary Dance. Her long collaboration with fashion designer Peter Speliopoulos began in 2000 with &quot;The Birds&quot;, created for the Greek National Ballet in Athens. He designed over 30 Armitage productions in opera and dance for important theaters in Europe including productions in France when Armitage served as resident choreographer for the Ballet de Lorraine (1999–2004). Their collaboration forms a significant role in the third period of Armitage&#x27;s work.

Upon her return to New York in 2004, Armitage relaunched Armitage Gone! Dance in a period of intense creativity. To complement her work with visual artists, Armitage began an ongoing collaboration with scientists, drawing upon conceptual ideas around time, space and geometry. In this new phase, Armitage created movement that looks spontaneous and personal, despite it is rigorous craftsmanship. Here dance, light, music, and design are unified into a balanced whole. Concepts such as “cubism in motion” are applied to group patterns creating several vantage points so that movement is seen from multiple perspectives, angles and levels with planes bleeding into each other. The steps themselves are based on calligraphy and fractal geometry (the geometry of nature: clouds, mountains, seashores) creating a sinuous, curvilinear vocabulary unlike the Euclidean geometry of the dance tradition. In her work, the dancers share a common purpose but do not dance in unison. Her spatial design is both elaborate and cohesive, producing a funky, democratic individuality. Extreme lyricism is punctuated by raw, violent accents.

==Music==
Armitage has choreographed to silence, used text as a score, worked with punk, rock, rap, electronic dance music and commissioned new scores. She searches for music that has a lot of space and silence, allowing the audience to see dance as a primary source of communication. Armitage has also worked with classical music, such as that of composers Béla Bartók (Time is the echo of an axe within a wood, György Ligeti (Ligeti Essays) and, more recently of György&#x27;s son, Lukas Ligeti. In a conversation with Lukas Ligeti for &quot;BOMB Magazine&quot;, Armitage described the challenge of choreographing &quot;Itutu&quot;. &quot;Itutu&quot; is a dance piece set to both Ligeti&#x27;s own compositions and those of Burkina Electric, a band based in Burkina Faso. Ligeti works with electronica and Burkinabe popular music in collaboration with the dancer-musicians in the group. &quot;Itutu&quot; was an opportunity to &quot;make these disparate, contradictory musical worlds mean something theatrical, exploring poly-visual dance and altered states of consciousness.&quot;[7]

==Dance Commissions==

Armitage has created dances for numerous companies including the Paris Opera Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, The Tasmanian Dance Company, Extemporary Dance Company, England, The White Oak Dance Project, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, Lyon Opera Ballet, Ballet Nacional de Cuba, The Greek National Ballet, the Washington Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, The Kansas City Ballet, the Bern Ballet, The Washington Ballet, Balletto Teatro di Torino, Rambert Dance Company, Introdans in Holland and the Boston Ballet.

==Dance and Science==

In 2010 Armitage created the first part of &quot;Three Theories&quot; inspired by Brian Greene&#x27;s popular science book The Elegant Universe. This premiered at the World Science Festival (physics of black holes and string theory. [4] Armitage stated that &quot;Physics makes me dream. I try to think outside the box and open up my mind. I like science. Science always questions authority. This conflict between theories seemed to me so dramatic and so incredibly fundamental.&quot;[5]

The Armitage GONE! Dance Company, debuted the full-length work version of &quot;Three Theories&quot;, in 2010 at Champaign-Urbana&#x27;s Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. The piece, born out of Armitage&#x27;s desire to embody core principles of physics, presented performing refreshingly virtuosic contemporary ballet choreography.

In March 2015, Armitage collaborated with the Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich and 30 dancers to create &quot;On The Nature of Things&quot;, a work about climate change in the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the first time the museum hosted a performance season.

==Dance and Theater==
In the summer of 2010 Armitage worked with the MIT- based composer Tod Machover on his opera titled &quot;Death and the Powers&quot;. In this opera Armitage incorporated choreography for robots as well as for singers.

Armitage has worked several times at the American Repertory Theater, notably David Adjmi&#x27;s play &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; which was also performed at the Yale Repertory Theater with Armitage choreography

==Dance and Orchestras==
Armitage choreographed two works for the New York Philharmonic presented at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Avery Fischer Hall. Both productions were conducted by music director Alan Gilbert. The first, Janáček&#x27;s &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot; premiered in 2011. The second, &quot;A Dancers Dream&quot;, (2013) featured New York City Ballet principal dancers Sara Mearns and Amar Ramasar with Armitage Gone! Dance in choreography to music by Igor Stravinsky.

In 2016 Armitage and Armitage Gone! Dance were commissioned by the London Philharmonia to create &quot;Agon&quot; with music by Stravinsky, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen as part of their Myths and Rituals season.

==Opera Director==
Armitage has directed operas from the baroque and contemporary repertoire for many of the prestigious houses of Europe. These include the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, the Lyric Opera in Athens and Het Muzik Theater in Amsterdam. Her most recent production of &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; for the Teatro di San Carlo Opera House in Naples from 2015 was filmed for RAI television and made into a DVD.

In 2007 Armitage directed and choreographed counter tenor Anthony Roth Costanzo&#x27;s Princeton production of &quot;Zefirino - The Voice of a Castrato&quot;.

Armitage directed &quot;Ariadne Unhinged&quot; for the Gotham Chamber Opera in New York and operas for Opera Saratoga including &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (2015) and Philip Glass&#x27;s (2016) &quot;The Witches of Venice&quot;.

==Making Art Dance Exhibition (2015)==

In 2015 Mana Contemporary presented Making Art Dance, an exhibition that surveyed 35 years of Armitage collaboration with artists and fashion designers in a 25,000 square foot gallery. Costumes, backdrops, sets, and drawings from 1978 to 2015 were nailed to walls, pinned on dress forms and hung from the rafters.
Christian Marclay, while a student at Mass College of Art, created set, costumes and posters for Armitage&#x27;s first work &quot;Ne&quot; in 1978. Her subsequent punk pieces were designed by filmmaker, Charles Atlas. Painter, David Salle became her primary collaborator in 1984. Salle created films, costumes, backdrops, sculpture, flats, and props for several incarnations of New York-based Armitage dance companies as well as for European ballet and opera productions. Carroll Dunham created a backdrop for &quot;Les Stances a Sophie&quot; in 1988. Jeff Koons worked with Armitage from 1987 to 1996 on productions in the US and abroad creating sets and costumes in collaboration with David Salle. Philip Taaffe collaborated on &quot;Scheherzade&quot; in 1995 and on &quot;Itutu&quot; in 2008. Brice Marden created backdrops for the Italian production of &quot;Orfeo ed Eurdice&quot; in 2004 at Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. For &quot;Ariadne Unhinged&quot; in 2008, Vera Lutter created the set and Donald Baechler designed props. Karen Kilimnik created painted panels based on Domenico Tiepolo&#x27;s Il Designi Di Pulcinella for &quot;Made in Naples&quot; in 2009. Armitage collaborators include composers, architects, fashion designers, lighting designers and scientists. Film director, James Ivory created sets and costumes for Armitage in Florence, Italy, as did Jean Paul Gaultier and Christina Lacroix. Peter Speliopoulos, Creative Director of Donna Karan collaborated extensively to create costumes for Armitage productions from the mid-1990s and continues to do so today.

A smaller version of the exhibition was presented at the National Museum of Dance in Saratoga Springs, New York from 2015 to 2016. Several Armitage costumes remain on permanent display.

==Popular culture==
In addition to working for the stage, Armitage has worked with pop music, including choreography for Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;In The Closet&quot; and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Vogue&quot;. [6]

In 2012, she choreographed the Cirque du Soleil show &quot;Amaluna&quot;, a show highlighting the beauty and strength of women, loosely based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, directed by Diane Paulus.[8]

She has also choreographed several movies in collaboration with director James Ivory, including &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; and &quot;The White Countess&quot;. Her work has been the subject of two documentaries made for television: &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; (1985), directed by David Hinton and &quot;Wild Ballerina&quot; (1998), directed by Mark Kidel. Her ballet &quot;Rave&quot; was filmed for television for the European channel Arte.

<doc id="964949" wikidata="Q4712398" url="?curid=964949" title="Albina (mythology)">
<text>Albina, also known as Albine or The White Goddess, is a goddess (possibly Etruscan) associated with the dawn and the founding of Great Britain. She is first mentioned in the Anglo-Norman poem &quot;Des Grantz Geanz&quot;.

== Founding of Britain ==

The first mention of Albina is in the Anglo-Norman poem &quot;Des Grantz Geanz&quot;, which dates to the late 13th or early 14th century, and has been tentatively dated no later than 1333. An abridged form of the poem was appended as a prologue to the Brut Chronicle.

In the poem, Albina is the eldest of 30 daughters of a Greek king. The daughters resent the subjugation of marriage and conspire to murder their husbands, but the youngest confesses to the conspiracy before they can act. When their father learns of their plot, the twenty-nine unrepentant sisters are exiled from Greece and arrive at an uninhabited island, which they name Albion after Albina. There, they are seduced by incubi and give birth to a race of giants. These giants are identified as the ones that Brutus encounters when he arrives at Britain in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;.

An alternate version of the poem has Albina and her sisters as daughters of King Diodicias of Syria. In this version, the conspiracy is not revealed in advance and the sisters are exiled after successfully killing their husbands.

The account of Britain&#x27;s founding by Albina is referenced and dismissed in the Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles, as well as in John Milton&#x27;s History of Britain. The Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles attribute the story&#x27;s origin to Nennius, but Milton notes that no mention of Albina is found in Nennius&#x27;s body of work. Robert Graves&#x27; book &quot;The White Goddess&quot; picks up on this claim and describes Albina as of one of fifty sisters (see Danaïdes) who named Albion, ascribing the legend to Nennius. It is thought that the original name for Great Britain, Albion, was inspired by the White Cliffs of Dover, derived from the Latin albus, meaning &quot;white&quot; or &quot;bright&quot;.

== Possible Etruscan Origins ==
Albina is mentioned in Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s 1892 collection of folklore &quot;Etruscan Roman Remains in Popular Tradition&quot;. According to Leland, Albina was an Etruscan goddess of light and ill-fated lovers. The accounts of Albina were obtained by word of mouth from local and often illiterate peasants, some of whom were considered witches or . Possibly a combination of other deities such as Alpanu and Aurora, Albina is described as a beautiful flying woman (or fairy) and associated with light. The Albina referenced by Leland is likely only loosely related to the figure described in &quot;The White Goddess&quot;.

<doc id="964954" wikidata="Q381213" url="?curid=964954" title="Aero A.14">
<text>The Aero A.14 was a Czechoslovakian biplane military reconnaissance aircraft built in the 1920s. It was essentially a slightly modified version of the Hansa-Brandenburg C.I aircraft, widely-used by Austria-Hungary during the First World War, and for this reason, the aircraft is sometimes referred to as the A.14 Brandenburg. When equipped with a slightly different engine (the Hiero L in place of the standard Hiero N), the aircraft was designated A.15 instead. The two versions were otherwise almost identical.

Even though it was obsolete by the time it entered production in 1922, the A.14 is nevertheless noteworthy for its role in the establishment of Czech airline CSA. A.14s provided by the Czechoslovak Air Force served to survey routes that CSA airliners would soon fly, and at least 17 were put into service as mail planes between Prague and Bratislava. They could also carry a single passenger when required.

==Development and design==
The Hansa-Brandenburg C.I was an Austro-Hungarian reconnaissance aircraft that was designed by Ernst Heinkel as a development of the earlier Hansa-Brandenburg B.I. It was built in large numbers by three manufacturers (Hansa-Brandenburg, Phönix Flugzeug-Werke and Ufag), with 1258 aircraft delivered by 31 October 1918, after which reliable delivery records are not available.

The Hansa-Brandenburg C.I was one of the first aircraft types to be operated by the newly formed Czechoslovak Air Force, with some aircraft being flown to Czechoslovak airfields at the end of World War One and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and others being rebuilt from damaged examples found in factories and warehouses. By November 1919, the Czechoslovak Air Force had 46 airworthy C.Is, and in 1920 it purchased another 15 surplus machines from Austria, although further deliveries from that source were stopped by the Inter-Allied Commission that monitored the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the peace treaty that ended the state of war between the Allies of World War I and Austria.

The Hansa-Brandenburg proved popular in Czechoslovak service, with the type being easy to fly and maintain, and even when the faster Letov Š-1 reconnaissance aircraft entered service, the C.I remained in use for photo-reconnaissance and as an advanced trainer. As a result, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defence decided to order production of the C.I under license in Czechoslovakia, with Aero Vodochody being ordered to build three different versions of the Hansa-Brandenburg, the Aero A.14 and A.15, both powered by the Hiero 6 engine rated at , and the Aero A.26, powered by BMW IIIa engines. Both Hiero-powered variants were based on the Ufag-built C.I(U) series 369, while the less powerful Aero A.26 was based on the Phönix-built C.I(Ph) Series 26. A total of 25 A.14s and 24 A.15s were ordered in 1922, with five A.14s fitted with dual controls.

The A.14 and A.15 were two-bay biplanes of conventional construction. The fuselage had a wooden framework with plywood covering, while the wings had a wooden structure with fabric covering, with steel-tube interplane struts with wooden fairings. The tail surfaces were built of steel tubing with fabric covering. The A.14 was powered by a Hiero N engine, new-built by Breltfeld and Danĕk of Prague, while the A.15 used imported Hiero L engines. Both types were designed to carry armament, but in practice, the A.14, used as a trainer and transport, was unarmed. The A.15 was fitted with a fixed forward firing synchronised 7.7 mm (.303 in) Vickers machine gun, while a flexibly-mounted Lewis gun of the same calibre was fitted in the observer&#x27;s position. Bombs could be carried under the wings, with 12 to bombs or two bombs carried.

The Czechoslovak aircraft had a modified wing structure compared to the original Hansa-Brandenburg C.I on which it was based, with more wing ribs, while the A.14s were fitted with revised controls, using a joystick rather than a control wheel, but the A.15 reverted to the original controls.

==Operational history==
The first A.14 was accepted by the Czechoslovak authorities on 25 October 1922, with deliveries continuing into December that year. Because of the Czechoslovak Air Force&#x27;s urgent need for new pilots, the A.14s were used as trainers, and the intended armament was not fitted. The A.15s were delivered from March to August 1923, and were used for several roles within the Czechoslovakian Air Force&#x27;s frontline units, including reconnaissance, bombing, artillery direction and as an intermediate trainer. Some A.15s were modified for night flying, with modified cockpit lighting added, landing lights fitted and extended exhaust pipes to avoid blinding the crew, and were designated Ab.15. A.15s were also used in trials of spraying against Black arches (also known as Nun moths), an early example of crop dusting.

The Aero A.14 suffered from excessive engine vibration, and served for a relatively short time with the Czechoslovakian Air Force, with aircraft being transferred to the military transport group for evaluation, starting flying airmail trials in March 1923 between Prague and Bratislava in March 1923. The A.15 had a much longer career in front line service, serving until about 1930, when the deteriorating physical condition of the aircraft led them to be withdrawn from use and sold to civil users such as flying clubs.

The airmail trials carried out by the Czechoslovak Air Force in March–April 1923, which mainly used A.14s carrying civilian markings and registrations, were intended as proving flights to support the establishment of a state-owned civil airline. These plans were realised with the establishment of &quot;Československé státní aerolinie&quot; (ČSA) on 28 October 1923. Amongst the airline&#x27;s initial equipment were 17 Aero A.14s loaned by the Czechoslovak military. These were used to fly the airline&#x27;s first services, between Prague and Bratislava, on 29 October 1923. In 1924 and 1925, A-14s were responsible for almost all of ČSA&#x27;s services, flying over 90% of flights. Six A-14s were modified to carry two passengers, who sat facing each other, and these six aircraft were preferred for regular operations, with the single passenger aircraft being held in reserve. From 1926, de Havilland DH.50s (licence-built by Aero) took over ČSA&#x27;s mean routes, with the A.14 relegated to reserve aircraft, with ČSA returning its last A.14 to the Czechoslovak Air Force in 1927.

A.14s and A.15s remained in private use well into the 1930s, with the last aircraft removed from the register in 1936.

<text>The Kitchen is a non-profit, multi-disciplinary avant-garde performance and experimental art institution located at 512 West 19th Street, between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. As the organization undergoes a multi-year renovation it is currently sited at a satellite loft space in the West Village located at 163B Bank Street, where exhibitions and performances are regularly held. It was founded in Greenwich Village in 1971 by Steina and Woody Vasulka, who were frustrated at the lack of an outlet for video art. The space takes its name from the original location, the kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center which was the only available place for the artists to screen their video pieces. Although first intended as a location for the exhibition of video art, The Kitchen soon expanded its mission to include other forms of art and performance, and incorporated as a not-for-profit arts organization in 1973. In 1974, The Kitchen relocated to a building at the corner of Wooster and Broome Streets in SoHo. In 1987 it moved to its current location in Manhattan, New York City.

The first music director of The Kitchen was composer Rhys Chatham. The venue became known as a place where many no wave artists like Glenn Branca, Lydia Lunch and James Chance performed. Notable Kitchen alumni also include Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, Rocco Di Pietro, John Moran, Jay Scheib, Young Jean Lee&#x27;s Theater Company, Peter Greenaway, Michael Nyman, Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros, Gordon Mumma, Frederic Rzewski, Ridge Theater, The Future Sound of London, Leisure Class, Elliott Sharp, Brian Eno, Arthur Russell, Meredith Monk, Arleen Schloss, Vito Acconci, Keshavan Maslak, Elaine Summers, Lucinda Childs, Bill T. Jones, David Byrne/Talking Heads, chameckilerner, John Jasperse, Bryce Dessner, Nico Muhly, Dave Soldier, Soldier String Quartet, Komar and Melamid, ETHEL, Chris McIntyre, Sylvie Degiez, Wayne Lopes/CosmicLegends, Cindy Sherman, and Swans.

Today, The Kitchen focuses on presenting emerging artists, most of whom are local, and is committed to advancing work that is experimental in nature. Its facilities include a 155-seat black box performance space and a gallery space for audio and visual exhibitions. The Kitchen presents interdisciplinary work in music, dance, performance, video, film, visual art, and literature.

==History==

===Mercer Arts Center (1971–1973)===
Looking for a way to present their work to a public audience, Steina and Woody Vasulka rented the kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center, in the former Broadway Central Hotel in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. (The Mercer Arts Center was an important venue for music and theater performance in New York City from 1971 to 1973.) The Vasulkas, with help from Andy Mannik, opened The Kitchen as a presentation space for video artists on June 15, 1971. Later that year, the Vasulkas added music to their programming and named Rhys Chatham the first music director. The Kitchen continued their eclectic programming at the Mercer Arts Center until the summer of 1973 when they began planning to move to 59 Wooster Street. On August 3, 1973, the building that housed the Mercer Arts Center collapsed, making this decision final.

===Move to SoHo (1973–1986)===
By 1973, the Vasulkas and Rhys Chatham moved on to other projects and hired a talented arts administrator, Robert Stearns, to take over as executive director. The visual artist/composer Jim Burton became the new music director. The 1973–1974 season started in The Kitchen&#x27;s new location at the corner of Wooster and Broome streets in the former LoGiudice Gallery Building. During its time on 59 Wooster Street The Kitchen emerged as New York&#x27;s premiere avant-garde and experimental arts center. In addition to a performance space, a gallery and video viewing room were established at this location. At new location, The Kitchen began a program of video distribution, when video was still considered an experimental form.

===Chelsea location (1986–present)===
The Kitchen moved uptown to 512 West 19th Street, a former ice house, to begin the spring 1986 season and subsequently purchased the space in 1987. The inaugural event series in The Kitchen&#x27;s new home was entitled &quot;New Ice Nights&quot;. In 1991 The Kitchen held its twentieth anniversary celebration: &quot;The Kitchen Turns Twenty&quot; with a retrospective mini-music festival entitled &quot;Five Generations of Composers&quot;, as well as a re-creation of Jean Dupuy’s &quot;Soup and Tart&quot;, entitled: &quot;Burp: Soup and Tart Revisited&quot;. The Kitchen remains a space for interdisciplinary and experimental work by focusing its programming on emerging artists.

In fall of 2011, after seven years as the Executive Director and Chief Curator of The Kitchen, Debra Singer handed over the reins to former &quot;Artforum&quot; Editor-in-Chief Tim Griffin.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded The Kitchen with four feet of water from the Hudson River, causing damage of about $450,000. With insurance only covering less than half the loss from the storm, the Kitchen received grants from Time Warner and the Art Dealers Association of America, as well as from nonprofit organizations and foundations (like the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts).

In 2021, the Kitchen named Legacy Russell as the institution&#x27;s next Executive Director and Chief Curator.

==Notable series and performances==
* In 1971, Hermann Nitsch staged &quot;Aktions&quot; with bodies of slaughtered animals. Charlie Morrow staged &quot;Spirit Voices&quot;. chanting as a shaman with Gordon Mumma on saw, Carol Weber on flutes, a tuba ensemble, and high intensity soundscapes.
* In May 1975, Steve Reich and Musicians gave a performance of &quot;Work in Progress for 21 musicians and singers&quot;. Completed and premiered in 1976, the piece became &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;, now regarded as one of the composer&#x27;s landmark works.
* In 1977, Robert Mapplethorpe presented one of his first photography exhibitions entitled &quot;Erotic Photos&quot; at The Kitchen.
* In 1978, The Kitchen began its dance programming by establishing its &quot;Dancing In The Kitchen&quot; series curated by Cynthia Hedstrom. The goal of this series was to &quot;stretch the established boundaries of choreographic expression and [explore] new movement vocabularies&quot; by presenting works of dance and movement by both choreographers and non-choreographers.
* In 1979, The Kitchen began its &quot;Contemporary Music Series&quot; with goal of highlighting &quot;connections between different musical genres and styles of composition.&quot; Noteworthy composers presented during this series include Anthony Braxton, Philip Glass, and Anthony Davis, among many others. The series was curated by experimental composer and performer Arto Lindsay.
* Also in 1979, The Kitchen hosted the &quot;New Music/New York&quot; festival and conference, with performances by Laurie Anderson, Robert Ashley, Don Cherry, Tony Conrad, Petr Kotik, Alvin Lucier, Charlemagne Palestine, Steve Reich Ensemble, among others. 
* Also in 1979, the venue hosted early performances of &quot;24→24 Music&quot; by Arthur Russell and accompanying musicians.
* In 1980, the &quot;New Music/New York&quot; festival and conference was renamed &quot;New Music America&quot; and was held in a different city each year until its final iteration in 1990.
* In 1981, Julius Eastman&#x27;s &quot;The Holy Presence of Joan d&#x27;Arc&quot; was premiered at The Kitchen.
* In June 1981, The Kitchen hosted a 10th Anniversary celebration called &quot;Aluminum Nights&quot;. The two-day celebration featured film and video screenings by Steina and Woody Vasulka, Vito Acconci, Robert Ashley, Nam June Paik, The Kipper Kids, John Cage, and Robert Wilson; musical performances by Laurie Anderson, Booji Boy, Glenn Branca, Philip Glass Ensemble, Brian Eno, Fab Five Freddy, Love of Life Orchestra, Meredith Monk, Steve Reich and Musicians, Z&#x27;EV, Talking Heads, and George E. Lewis; and dance performances by Laura Dean, Bebe Miller, and Arnie Zane.
*On December 12, 1983, the Beastie Boys gave one of their early performances at The Kitchen.
* In 1991, a program called &quot;Working in The Kitchen&quot; brought together a group of choreographers who worked collaboratively over a four-month period to create performances at The Kitchen.
* In 1995, in the spirit of &quot;Working in The Kitchen&quot;, a series was established called &quot;Dance and Process&quot;, in which a group of emerging choreographers are given a residency to develop their work in a collaborative &quot;workshop&quot; environment with the guidance of an established choreographer as the curator. Past curators have included Sarah Michelson, Dean Moss, Yasuko Yokoshi, and Miguel Gutierrez. &quot;Dance and Process&quot; is The Kitchen&#x27;s longest running series.
*From 1994 to 1997, the Hybrid Nights performance series was initiated by curator, Kathryn Greene also known as Caterina Verde.
* On November 10, 1995, David Hykes&#x27; &quot;Earth to the Unknown Power&quot; was performed here by The Harmonic Choir. The concert was sent live via ISDN to Le Thoronet Abbey in Southern France, where the exquisite acoustics was recorded and then broadcast back to the audience in New York.
* From 2000 to 2005, The Kitchen produced a music series called &quot;Kitchen House Blend&quot;, in which composers were commissioned to write for its &quot;house band,&quot; a 10-piece experimental chamber ensemble whose instrumentation included drums, percussion, keyboard, trumpet, trombone, two multi-instrumentalist wind players, violin, cello, and bass. Conceived by Music Curator John King, the goal for &quot;Kitchen House Blend&quot; was to combine musicians and composers from various communities to create new works that crossed boundaries of style and performance practice. During the series, The Kitchen commissioned music by a total of 30 composers including Matthew Shipp, Susie Ibarra, Roy Nathanson, Elliott Sharp, Roy Campbell Jr., Zeena Parkins, Evan Ziporyn, Kitty Brazelton, Vijay Iyer, Anthony Coleman, Lee Hyla, David Krakauer, Ikue Mori, Lois V Vierk, and Derek Bermel. The group also performed and toured choreographer Molissa Fenley and composer and pianist Anthony Davis&#x27; early 1980s collaborative work &quot;Hemispheres&quot;.
* In 2011, The Kitchen marked its 40th anniversary with a number of events throughout the year, beginning with the Spring Benefit Gala, which honored Philip Glass on May 4. Next, were two music events celebrating the anniversary. The first event, &quot;Aluminum Music&quot; April 15–16 – which itself was a 30-year commemoration of a 1981 Kitchen event &quot;Aluminum Nights&quot; – featured Z&#x27;EV and No-Wavers Bush Tetras on April 15, followed by former music director (and Aluminum Nights co-curator) George E. Lewis with Peter Gordon&#x27;s Love of Life Orchestra on the bill April 16. The second music event was September 9–10, curated by the first Kitchen Music Director Rhys Chatham, &quot;&#x27;Pioneers of the Downtown Sound&quot; with Pauline Oliveros, Joan La Barbara, and Chatham playing on September 9 and Tony Conrad, Laurie Spiegel, and Chatham featured on September 10. The anniversary culminated with the summer-long exhibition &quot;The View from a Volcano: The Kitchen&#x27;s Soho Years, 1971-85&quot;, which highlighted the rich history of the early years with video documentation and ephemera from works by such artists as Vito Acconci, Laurie Anderson, Karole Armitage, Robert Ashley, Charles Atlas, Beastie Boys, Eric Bogosian, John Cage, Jean Dupuy, Molissa Fenley, Joan Jonas, Bill T. Jones, Christian Marclay, Meredith Monk, Nam June Paik, Steve Reich, Rock Steady Crew, Arthur Russell, Elizabeth Streb, Talking Heads, Steina and Woody Vasulka, Bill Viola, and more.

<text>Egeria, Etheria, or Aetheria was a Hispano-Roman Christian woman, widely regarded to be the author of a detailed account of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land about 381/2–384. The long letter, dubbed Peregrinatio or Itinerarium Egeriae, is addressed to a circle of women at home. Historical details it contains set the journey in the early 380s, making it the earliest of its kind. It survives in fragmentary form in a later copy—lacking a title, date and attribution.

==Discovery and identity==
The middle part of Egeria&#x27;s writing survived and was copied in the &quot;Codex Aretinus&quot;, which was written at Monte Cassino in the 11th century, while the beginning and end are lost. This &quot;Codex Aretinus&quot; was discovered in 1884 by the Italian scholar Gian Francesco Gamurrini, in a monastic library in Arezzo. In 2005, Jesús Alturo identified two new fragments from one manuscript &quot;circa&quot; 900 in Carolingian minuscule.

Gamurrini published the Latin text and theorised the author was Sylvia of Aquitaine. In 1903, Marius Férotin claimed the author is one Aetheria or Egeria, known from a letter written by the seventh century Galician monk Valerio of Bierzo. He dated her pilgrimage to about 381–384, during the reign of Theodosius I. Férotin believed she was from Gallaecia, but in 1909 Karl Meister disputed Férotin&#x27;s theory about the date of Egeria&#x27;s pilgrimage and her identity. Meister argues that her language shows no evidence of Iberian Romance but rather suggests that she may have been from one of the well-known religious houses of sixth century Gallia Narbonensis; according to this theory, her pilgrimage took place in the first half of the reign of Justinian I (&quot;r.&quot; 527–565). John Bernard noted that certain details of Egeria&#x27;s account that support the earlier dating — two churches mentioned in the &quot;Breviarium&quot; and &quot;Peregrinatio Theodosii&quot; (both &quot;circa&quot; 530)—are absent from Egeria&#x27;s otherwise detailed description of Jerusalem and thus confirm the 4th century dating. Most scholars favor the 4th century date.

It is through Valerio&#x27;s letter that we first see the name Aetheria or Egeria, and have much of the biographical information. He praises Egeria and identifies her as a nun, perhaps because she addresses her account to her &quot;sorores&quot; (Latin for &quot;sisters&quot;) at home. However, others (including Hagith Sivan, 1988) have pointed out that during Egeria&#x27;s time it was common to address fellow lay Christians as &quot;sisters&quot; and &quot;brothers&quot;. It is possible that Egeria used the term to address her Christian acquaintances. Valerio may also have believed her to be a nun because she went on such a pilgrimage, although lay women of the time are known to have engaged in such religious tourism. Egeria&#x27;s ability to make a long and expensive journey by herself, her numerous acquaintances and attentive guides in the places she visited, and her education indicate her middle or upper class wealthy background. In his letter to Egeria, Valerio mentioned the shores of the &quot;Western sea&quot; or &quot;Ocean&quot; from which Egeria was sprung, which suggests he was writing about a person travelling from the Roman Gallaecia, but Meister believes that her reference to the river Rhone supports his theory of Gaulish origin.

==&quot;Travels of Egeria&quot;==
Egeria set down her observations in a letter now called &quot;Itinerarium Egeriae&quot; (&quot;Travels of Egeria&quot;). It is sometimes also called &quot;Peregrinatio Aetheriae&quot; (&quot;Pilgrimage of Aetheria&quot;) or &quot;Peregrinatio ad Loca Sancta&quot; (&quot;Pilgrimage to the Holy Lands&quot;) or some other combination. It is the earliest extant graphic account of a Christian pilgrimage. The text has numerous lacunae.

The text is a narrative apparently written at the end of Egeria&#x27;s journey from notes she took en route, and addressed to her &#x27;dear ladies&#x27;: the women of her spiritual community back home. In the first extant part of the text, she describes the journey from her approach to Mount Sinai until her stop in Constantinople. Staying for three years in Jerusalem, she made excursions to Mount Nebo and to the tomb of Job in ancient Carneas or Karnaia (modern Al-Shaykh Saad, Syria). She wrote extensively on her observations of Holy Week proceedings and an Easter vigil, both at Jerusalem in immediate succession of each other.

Additionally, she visited the burial places of Haran, the brother of Abraham, as well as the site where Eliezer met with Rebecca. She spent time at the Sea of Galilee and comments on the traditions, which include that of Christ feeding the multitude and the place where he performed his miracles. On her way back to Europe she stopped at Hagia Thekla—i. e. the shrine of Saint Thecla&#x27;s near Seleucia Isauriae (modern Silifke, Turkey), particularly venerated by women. Upon her return to Constantinople, she planned to make a further trip to St. John&#x27;s at Ephesus.

The second portion of the text is a detailed account of the liturgical services and observances of the church calendar in Jerusalem (most likely, under Cyril), The liturgical year was in its incipient stages at the time of her visit. This is invaluable because the development of liturgical worship (e. g. Lent, Palm or Passion Sunday) reached universal practice in the 4th century. Egeria provides a first-hand account of practices and implementation of liturgical seasons as they existed at the time of her visit. This snapshot is before universal acceptance of a December 25 celebration of the nativity of Jesus; this is very early and very helpful in cataloguing the development of annual liturgical worship.

Philologists have studied Egeria&#x27;s letter, which contains a wealth of information about the evolution of Latin in late antiquity into the &quot;Proto-Romance&quot; language, from which the medieval and modern family of Romance languages later emerged. For example, expressions such as &quot;deductores sancti illi&quot; (meaning &quot;those holy guides&quot; in classical Latin, but here rather simply &quot;the holy guides&quot;) reveal the origins of the definite article now used in the Romance languages (except for Sardinian and certain dialects of Catalan)—cf. Spanish (&quot;las santas guías&quot;) or Italian (&quot;le sante guide&quot;). Similarly, the use of &quot;ipsam&quot; in a phrase such as &quot;per mediam vallem ipsam&quot; (classical Latin &quot;through [the] middle of [the] valley itself&quot;) anticipates the definite article (&quot;péri su mesu de sa bàdde&quot;) found in Sardinian and in some dialects of Catalan, namely Balearic Catalan, along the Costa Brava (Catalonia), and in the Valencian municipalities of Tàrbena and La Vall de Gallinera.

<text>The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and burial site of Richard Milhous Nixon, the 37th president of the United States (1969–1974), and his wife Pat Nixon.

Located in Yorba Linda, California, on land that President Nixon&#x27;s family once owned, the library is one of 13 administered by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The campus is located at 18001 Yorba Linda Boulevard in Yorba Linda and incorporates the Richard Nixon Birthplace, a National Historic Landmark where Nixon was born in 1913 and spent his childhood.

From its dedication on July 19, 1990, until July 11, 2007, the library and museum was operated by the private Richard Nixon Foundation and was known as the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace. The facility underwent an extensive renovation in 2016 and now features updated, multimedia museum exhibits. The complex is jointly operated by NARA and the Richard Nixon Foundation.

== Background prior to dedication ==
The Nixon Presidential Library was originally going to be built on the edge of Duke University, Nixon&#x27;s alma mater, but due to protests largely driven by a group of Duke professors, the plans failed. 

Historically, all presidential papers were considered the personal property of the president. Some took them at the end of their terms while others destroyed them. In 1939, Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first to make them available to the public when he donated them to the National Archives, as the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, doing so voluntarily. The Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon&#x27;s subsequent resignation from office complicated the issue.

In September 1974, Richard Nixon made an agreement with the head of the General Services Administration, Arthur F. Sampson, to turn over most materials from his presidency, including the tape recordings he had made of conversations in the White House. The recordings were to be destroyed after September 1, 1979, if directed by Nixon, or by September 1, 1984, or his death otherwise.

Alarmed that Nixon&#x27;s tapes may be lost, Congress abrogated the Nixon–Sampson Agreement by passing the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, which was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in December 1974. It applied specifically to materials from the Nixon presidency, directing NARA to take ownership of the materials and process them as quickly as possible. Private materials were to be returned to Nixon.

As a result of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, President Nixon&#x27;s White House papers and tapes were held by the National Archives, and so they could not be transferred to a facility in Yorba Linda. Funding to build the Nixon Library came from private sources. The estimated cost to build the institution was $25 million. In December 1988, ground was broken by Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the youngest daughter of President Nixon and Mrs. Nixon.

== Dedication ==
The Library complex was officially dedicated on July 19, 1990. Former President Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon were present, as were President George H. W. Bush, former President Gerald Ford, former President Ronald Reagan, and first ladies Barbara Bush, Betty Ford, and Nancy Reagan. A crowd of 50,000 gathered for the ceremony. At the dedication, Nixon said, &quot;Nothing we have ever seen matches this moment–to be welcomed home again.&quot;

== Facilities ==


The museum, housed in a building, offers a narrative of Nixon&#x27;s life and career. Behind the museum is his birthplace, which was constructed by Nixon&#x27;s father using a home building kit, and restored to appear as it was in the 1910s. President Nixon and Pat Nixon are buried on the grounds, just a few feet from the birthplace.

The Nixon Library compound contains the Katharine B. Loker Center and Annenberg Court, a wing constructed in 2004, which includes a special exhibit room and an exact replica of the East Room of the White House that is used as an event space. The Nixon Foundation leases the East Room for events such as weddings and business meetings.

== Presidential Museum ==
There is an extensive collection of memorabilia, artifacts, formal clothing, and photographs of the Nixons and their children. This collection includes an assortment of bronze figures of world leaders who had important relations with Nixon as president or during his service as vice president under President Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961. The leaders have been accurately recreated in lightweight bronze over a papier-mâché frame, and they are dressed in their actual clothing. 

The U.S. government limousine used by President Nixon throughout his presidency, a customized 1969 Lincoln Continental, is on display in the domestic affairs gallery. A piece of the Berlin Wall is exhibited in the expansive foreign affairs gallery, which includes a replica of a modest Midwest home from where American soldiers originated, statues of Nixon and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and pages of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty I signed by Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev in 1972.

Lieutenant Colonel Gene Boyer, President Nixon&#x27;s chief helicopter pilot, secured the President&#x27;s VH-3A &quot;Sea King&quot; helicopter, tail number 150617, for permanent display on the library grounds. The helicopter was in the presidential fleet from 1961 to 1976, transporting Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, and many foreign heads of state and government. Boyer flew President Nixon dozens of times to Camp David, over the pyramids in Egypt, and on his final flight from the White House in this aircraft.

The entire facility underwent a $15 million renovation in 2016, and reopened in October, with appearances from Dr. Henry Kissinger, former California Governor Pete Wilson and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai. The new museum includes nearly 70 exhibits, including a replica of President Nixon&#x27;s Oval Office. 

Much of the media surrounding the reopening referred to the museum&#x27;s appeals to the Millennial generation. &quot;USA Today&quot; called it &quot;a video-centric, cutting-edge experience&quot; in which &quot;guests are constantly invited to try touch screens or other interactive displays.&quot; The museum galleries were fact-checked for accuracy by four historians appointed by the National Archives. The money was raised entirely from private sources.

The Nixon Library administers the Nixon Geography Challenge, a 35-question test of countries and sites around the world, to Middle School students in Yorba Linda. Test takers with high scores are honored at the library with a certificate of distinction. 

== Joint operation with the National Archives ==

In January 2004, the United States Congress passed legislation that provided for the establishment of a federally-operated Nixon Presidential Library. Specifically, the legislation amended the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974, which mandated that Nixon&#x27;s presidential materials were to remain in National Archives II facility in College Park, Maryland. Under this new legislation, over 30,000 presidential gifts as well as millions of presidential records were moved from College Park to Yorba Linda.

In March 2005, the Nixon Foundation invited the National Archives to jointly operate the Nixon Library, and then-Archivist of the United States Allen Weinstein allowed for the Nixon Library to become the twelfth federally funded presidential library, operated and staffed by NARA, in conjunction with the Nixon Foundation. In April 2006, Weinstein appointed Timothy Naftali director of the NARA Library activities. On July 11, 2007, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum was officially welcomed into the federal presidential library system.

Before the National Archives took over its management, the Nixon Library had been accused by several media outlets of glossing over Nixon&#x27;s 1974 resignation with &quot;whitewashed&quot; exhibits. In 2007, the National Archives removed the Watergate exhibit that had been in place for 17 years and, after three years of empty exhibit space, announced that the new exhibit was scheduled to open in July 2010. The Nixon Foundation objected to the proposed exhibit, specifically the process by which the proposed exhibit was crafted, due to the fact that the Nixon Foundation was not consulted in the way that other presidential foundations are in similar situations. The foundation filed a 158-page memorandum to the assistant archivist for presidential libraries expressing its dissatisfaction and NARA stated a committee would review the objection but gave no timeline for when that process would be concluded. The exhibit opened on March 31, 2011.

In November 2011, the director of the library, Tim Naftali, resigned his position. In December 2014, Michael Ellzey was appointed as Director by the Archivist of the United States, David Ferriero. Ellzey began serving as Director in January 2015. in April 2023, Ellzey was succeeded as Director by Tamara Martin, the former California State Archivist, who was appointed by Acting U.S. Archivist Debra Steidel Wall.

== Library collections ==
The archives, which opened in March 1994, a month before Nixon&#x27;s death, house approximately 46 million pages of official White House records from the Nixon Administration. The Nixon Library now holds all of President Nixon&#x27;s presidential, as well as his pre- and post-presidential papers.

As of 2012, all processed Nixon presidential materials are available for research use at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California.
