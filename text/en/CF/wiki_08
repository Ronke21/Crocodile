<text>North is a 1994 American comedy-drama adventure film directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the 1984 novel &quot;North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents&quot; by Alan Zweibel, who wrote the screenplay and has a minor role in the film.

The cast includes Elijah Wood in the title role, with Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. Bruce Willis narrates and plays several different roles throughout the film, and a 9-year-old Scarlett Johansson appears briefly in her film debut. This was the final theatrical film for Alexander Godunov before his death the following year.

The film was shot in Hawaii, Alaska, California, South Dakota, New Jersey, and New York. It was a box office bomb, grossing $12 million against its $40 million budget. &quot;North&quot; was panned by critics, and has been referred to as one of the worst films ever made.

== Plot ==

Skilled in academics, sports, and drama, and praised for his good work and obedience, North feels unvalued by his own parents. One day, while finding solace in a living room display at a mall, he complains to the Easter Bunny—a man in a pink bunny suit—who recommends that North simply explain his feelings to them, but North says their neglect makes them undeserving. Aided and encouraged by his best friend Winchell, who works on the school paper, North plots to &quot;divorce&quot; his parents, hiring ambulance-chasing lawyer Arthur Belt to file the papers. The announcement greatly shocks his parents, leaving them unresponsive when Judge Buckle grants his petition, giving him one summer to find new parents or go to an orphanage.

North&#x27;s first stop is Texas, where his parental candidates, Ma and Pa Tex, promise to use their wealth to fulfill North&#x27;s desires. In a musical number (set to the Bonanza theme), they explain that their first son, Buck, died in a stampede and they plan to use North to replace Buck, planning out his entire life in advance, including his future wife. They also place massive quantities of food on his dinner plate, hoping that he will eat as much as Buck did (as Pa Tex had earlier mentioned Buck&#x27;s obesity to North, saying &quot;he could eat more in one day than anyone else could eat in a whole month&quot;). Gabby, a sharpshooting cowboy (also the man in the Easter Bunny suit), presents North with a souvenir from his act—a silver dollar with a bullet hole shot through its center—and notes that North is unhappy with the Texes because he wishes to be appreciated for who he is, not made into someone else, advising him to move on.

His next stop is Hawaii, where Governor and Mrs. Ho, who cannot have biological children, are eager to adopt him. Believing that North&#x27;s presence in Hawaii will attract mainlanders, the governor unveils a tourism campaign that references the classic Coppertone ad by showcasing North&#x27;s bare buttocks, horrifying him. On the beach, a tourist with a metal detector (also the man in the bunny suit) explains to North that parents should not use children for personal gain.

In an Inuit village in Alaska, North&#x27;s prospective parents calmly send their elderly grandfather out to sea on an ice floe to die with dignity, disturbing him. As the long, dark winter arrives, he realizes that his summer is almost up. Meanwhile, his now-catatonic real parents are put in a museum display. His quest has inspired children worldwide to leave their parents and hire Arthur and Winchell, both now rich and powerful. North&#x27;s next family is Amish, but the lack of conveniences quickly disappoints him. His experiences in Zaire, China, and Paris are equally fruitless. Finally, he finds the Nelsons, an ideal family who give him attention and appreciation, but he is still unsatisfied.

In despair, North escapes to New York City, where Winchell and Arthur, fearing their lucrative business will fail, plot to assassinate him. On the run, he receives a videotape from his newly revived parents begging for his forgiveness and his return home. Standup comedian Joey Fingers (the same man in the bunny suit) encourages him. At the airport, a mob of kids who have followed his example confront him, angry about his returning to his parents, forcing him to ship himself home in a FedEx box. Recognizing the delivery driver from his other appearances, North asks if he is his guardian angel. The man denies meeting North, but as a FedEx representative, he resembles a guardian of important items.

North is delivered to his house prior to the deadline, but as he runs toward his parents, Winchell&#x27;s assassin Al takes aim. As he squeezes the trigger, North awakens in the now-empty mall. The Easter Bunny takes him home, where his parents, who have been worried during his absence, greet him warmly. It has all been a dream, but in his pocket, North discovers Gabby&#x27;s silver dollar. North says he has always had it, &quot;for good luck&quot;, and goes inside as his parents agree to bring him dinner in bed.

== Reception ==
&quot;North&quot; has been called one of the worst films ever made. On review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;North&quot; received a rating of 14% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads, &quot;Laden with schmaltz and largely bereft of evident narrative purpose, &quot;North&quot; represents an early major disappointment from previously sure-handed director Rob Reiner.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Kenneth Turan stated in his review &quot;The problem overall is not so much that the humor, especially in the parent-tryout situations, is forced, but that it simply is not there at all. So little is going on in this mildest of fantasies that it is hard to even guess what kinds of emotional effects were aimed at in the first place.&quot; Turan also asked &quot;How could director Rob Reiner, whose touch for what pleases a mass audience is usually unfailing, have strayed this far?&quot; Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as a &quot;noble misfire&quot; and &quot;that unique breed of misconceived entertainment that only a filmmaker of talent is capable of making.&quot; Joe Brown of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a gentle, harmless and rather pedestrian fantasy.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was somewhat more positive, writing that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t always work, but much of it is clever in amusingly unpredictable ways.&quot;

&quot;North&quot; was a multiple nominee at the 15th Golden Raspberry Awards in six categories including Worst Picture and Worst Director for Rob Reiner.

In an interview with Archive of American Television, Reiner defended the film, saying: 
=== Siskel &amp; Ebert&#x27;s reviews ===

Film critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; seemed especially baffled by &quot;North&quot;, describing Reiner as &quot;a gifted filmmaker&quot; and Wood as &quot;a talented young actor&quot;, yet &quot;North&quot; was &quot;one of the worst movies ever made.&quot; Ebert stressed that he &quot;hated this movie&quot; and also suggested the film was so poorly written that even the best child actor would look bad in it, and viewed it as &quot;some sort of lapse&quot; on Reiner&#x27;s part. Ebert awarded &quot;North&quot; a rare zero-star rating.

Comedian Richard Belzer, who appeared in &quot;North&quot;, goaded Reiner into reading aloud some of the review at Reiner&#x27;s roast; Reiner jokingly insisted that &quot;if you read between the lines, [the review] isn&#x27;t really that bad.&quot; An abridged version of the remark quoted above became the title of a 2000 book by Ebert, &quot;I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie&quot;, a compilation of reviews of films most disliked by Ebert.

Writer Alan Zweibel described the review as &quot;[E]mbarrassing. And hurtful&quot;, and stated it was repeatedly quoted to him, his wife, and his son (who had inspired the book &quot;North&quot;). In an encounter with Ebert years later, Zweibel jokingly said &quot;And I just have to tell you, Roger, that that sweater you&#x27;re wearing? I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate that sweater.&quot; He also keeps a clipping of it in his wallet, which he reads at public events.

Ebert and his co-host on &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot;, Gene Siskel, both pronounced it the worst film of 1994, an opinion they each came to independently. In their original review, Ebert called it &quot;one of the most thoroughly hateful movies in recent years. A movie that makes me cringe even when I&#x27;m sitting here thinking about it.&quot; He later added, &quot;I hated this movie as much as any movie we have ever reviewed in the 19 years we&#x27;ve been doing this show. I hated it because of the premise, which seems shockingly cold-hearted, and because this premise is being suggested to &quot;kids&quot; as children&#x27;s entertainment, and because everybody in the movie was vulgar and stupid, and because the jokes weren&#x27;t funny, and because most of the characters were obnoxious, and because of the phony attempt to add a little pseudo-hip philosophy with the Bruce Willis character.&quot; Siskel added, &quot;I think you gotta hold Rob Reiner&#x27;s feet to the fire here. I mean, he&#x27;s the guy in charge . . . he&#x27;s saying this is entertainment . . . it&#x27;s deplorable. There isn&#x27;t a gag that works. You couldn&#x27;t &quot;write&quot; worse jokes if I &quot;told&quot; you to write worse jokes. The ethnic stereotyping is appalling . . . it&#x27;s embarrassing . . . you feel unclean as you&#x27;re sitting there. It&#x27;s junk. First-class junk!&quot; and finished his statement with &quot;Any subject could be done well; this is just trash, Roger.&quot; Ebert&#x27;s future co-host on &quot;Ebert and Roeper&quot;, Richard Roeper, would later go on to list &quot;North&quot; as one of the 40 worst movies he&#x27;s ever seen, stating: &quot;Of all the films on this list, &quot;North&quot; may be the most difficult to watch from start to finish. I&#x27;ve tried twice and failed. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t even bother. Life is too short.&quot;

=== Box office ===
The film grossed only $7 million in the United States and Canada and $12.2 million worldwide, making it one of the worst-performing films of the year given its large budget.

<text>Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player&#x27;s sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press (or step on) buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. Rhythm games often feature novel game controllers shaped like musical instruments such as guitars and drums to match notes while playing songs. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.

The 1996 title &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; has been deemed the first influential rhythm game, whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. In 1997, Konami&#x27;s &quot;Beatmania&quot; sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan. The company&#x27;s music division, Bemani, released a series of music-based games over the next several years. The most successful of these was the 1998 dance mat game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, which was the only Bemani title to achieve large-scale success outside Japan, and would see numerous imitations of the game from other publishers.

Other Japanese games, particularly &quot;Guitar Freaks&quot;, led to development of the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; series that used instrument-shaped controllers to mimic the playing of actual instruments. Spurred by the inclusion of popular rock music, the two series revitalized the rhythm genre in the Western Market, significantly expanded the console video game market and its demographics. The games provided a new source of revenue for the artists whose music appeared on the soundtracks. The later release of &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; as well as the even later &quot;Rocksmith&quot; would allow players to play the songs using a real electric guitar. By 2007 rhythm games were considered to be one of the most popular video game genres, behind other action games. However, by 2009, the market was saturated by spin-offs from the core titles, which led to a nearly 50% drop in revenue for music game publishers; within a few years, both series announced they would be taking a hiatus from future titles.

Despite these setbacks, the rhythm game market continues to expand, introducing a number of dance-based games like Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Just Dance&quot; and Harmonix&#x27;s &quot;Dance Central&quot; that incorporate the use of motion controllers and camera-based controls like the Kinect. Existing games also continue to thrive on new business models, such as the reliance on downloadable content to provide songs to players. The introduction of the eighth generation of console hardware has also spurred return of Activision&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and Harmonix&#x27;s &quot;Rock Band&quot; titles in late 2015.

== Definition and game design ==
Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre of action game that challenges a player&#x27;s sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; and music-based games such as &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, in order to test a player&#x27;s singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of &quot;Simon&quot;, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.

In some rhythm games, the screen displays an avatar who performs in reaction to the player&#x27;s controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player&#x27;s avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.

== History ==
=== Origins and popularity in Japan (1970s–2000) ===
One early rhythm-based electronic game was the handheld game &quot;Simon&quot;, created in 1978 by Ralph Baer (who created the Magnavox Odyssey) and Howard Morrison. The game used the &quot;call and response&quot; mechanic, in which players take turns repeating increasingly complicated sequences of button presses.

Human Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Dance Aerobics&quot; was an early rhythm-based video game released in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo&#x27;s Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and as one of the first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed the core of future rhythm games. The success of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game &quot;Beatmania&quot; in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a rubber pad that emulates a vinyl record. &quot;Beatmania&quot; was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami&#x27;s Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot;, which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot;, a game similar to &quot;Beatmania&quot; in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red Octane and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;. In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad because of the cost of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title &quot;DrumMania&quot; featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

&quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, released in 1998, is a rhythm game in which players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot;, &quot;DrumMania&quot; and &quot;Beatmania&quot;, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix&#x27;s &quot;Bust a Groove&quot; features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.

NanaOn-Sha, the creators of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;, released &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; in 1999. It eschews instrument-shaped controllers; instead, players maneuver the protagonist through an obstacle course by pressing buttons at correct times. The game&#x27;s levels are generated by the background music, which players may change by inserting audio CDs. While it was praised for its unique style and artistry, &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot;″s simple vector graphics proved difficult to market, and the game was never released in North America. Sega&#x27;s &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, released in arcades in 1999 and on the Dreamcast in 2000, features maraca-shaped, motion-sensitive controllers. The game allows for two-player gameplay, provides a spectacle for onlookers and allows players to socialise while gaming. In 2000, &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot; combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music, and became highly successful in Japanese arcades. The game was later released on consoles in the West as &quot;Taiko Drum Master&quot;, and the franchise continues to receive new installments in Japan, as well as console releases around the world. &quot;Gitaroo Man&quot; featured a guitar-playing protagonist four years before the release of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar-shaped controller.

=== Popularity in the West (2001–2004) ===
Harmonix was formed in 1995 from a computer music group at MIT. Beginning in 1998, the company developed music games inspired by &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;. In 2001, the company released &quot;Frequency&quot;, which puts the player in control of multiple instrument tracks. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the game provides a greater sense of creative freedom than earlier rhythm titles. &quot;Frequency&quot; was critically acclaimed; however, marketing was made difficult by the game&#x27;s abstract style, which removed the player&#x27;s ability to perform for onlookers. In 2003, Harmonix followed up &quot;Frequency&quot; with the similar &quot;Amplitude&quot;. The company later released a more socially driven, karaoke-themed music game in &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; (2003). &quot;Donkey Konga&quot;, a GameCube title developed by Namco and released in 2003, achieved widespread success by leveraging Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; brand.

=== Peripheral-based games (2005–2013) ===
In 2005, &quot;Gitaroo Man&quot;&#x27;s creator Keiichi Yano released &quot;Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan&quot;, a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS that utilizes the handheld&#x27;s touchscreen features. It became a highly demanded import title, which led to the release of an altered version of the game in the West—&quot;Elite Beat Agents&quot;—and a sequel in Japan.
Also in 2005, Harmonix and the small publisher RedOctane released &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, a game inspired by Bemani&#x27;s &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot;. However, instead of the Japanese pop that comprises the earlier title&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; features Western rock music. The game reinvigorated the rhythm genre, which had stagnated because of a flood of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; sequels and imitations. &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; spawned several sequels, and the franchise overall earned more than $1 billion, with the third installment ranking as the best selling game in North America in 2007. Harmonix followed &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; with the &quot;Rock Band&quot; franchise, which also earned over $1 billion. &quot;Rock Band&quot; titles support multiple instrument controllers and cooperative multiplayer, allowing players to play as a full band. The &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; franchise followed suit with the band-oriented, Neversoft-developed &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;. &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; installments based on specific bands, such as Metallica and Aerosmith, were also published. Additional songs for &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; were made available for purchase via the Internet, which generated further revenue. Artists whose work is featured in the games receive royalties, and the increased publicity in turn generates further sales of their music. The success of the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; franchises widened the console video game market and its demographics, and the popularity of the genre drove increased sales of consoles. In 2008, it was reported that music games had become the second most popular video game genre (behind action) in the United States, with 53% of players being female. At its height in 2008, music games represented about 18% of the video game market.

Video game industry analysts considered 2009 to be a critical year for rhythm games, and they believed that it would allow them to gauge the future success of the genre. Both the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; franchises were expanded, and they received entries for handheld gaming devices and mobile phones. Specialized titles that targeted specific genres and demographics, such as &quot;Band Hero&quot; for pop music and &quot;Lego Rock Band&quot; for younger players, were released. Sales of music games were down in the first half of the year. This decline was attributed to fewer purchases of instrument controllers; it was assumed that players had already bought such controllers and were reusing them. While analysts had expected that United States sales of &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot; and &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot; would be high—close to or exceeding one million units each in the first month of their release—sales only reached roughly half of those projections. The failure to meet sales projections was partly attributed to the impact of the late-2000s recession on the video game industry; Harmonix&#x27;s CEO Alex Rigopulos considered that at the time, both &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; were the most expensive video games on the market. Analysts also considered it to be a sign of market saturation. Further contributing to the decline was genre stagnation; the franchises retained the same basic gameplay over several iterations, giving consumers less incentive to buy additional titles. Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopulos felt that the aggressive competition between the &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; brands on the belief that the market could only support one franchise also contributed to the decline of these games. As a result, analysts lowered their expectations for future music games; for example, projections of first quarter U.S. sales of &quot;DJ Hero&quot;, a &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; &quot;spin-off&quot;, were reduced from 1.6 million units to only 600,000. Sales of rhythm games, which totalled $1.47 billion in 2008, reached only $700 million in 2009. Analysts predicted that the market would settle at the same &quot;healthy&quot; $500–600 million level of the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter concluded that the saturation of the rhythm game market accounted for one-third of the industry&#x27;s 12% sales decline in 2009.

The fallout of the weakening rhythm game market affected game developers, publishers and distributors. Companies in the latter two categories believed that most consumers would own at least one set of instrument controllers by 2010, which would increase the importance of software and downloadable content sales.
Activision scaled back its 2010 &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; release schedule to just two games, reducing the number of SKUs from 25 in 2009 to 10 in 2010. The company closed several in-house developers, including RedOctane, Neversoft&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; division, and Underground Development. Viacom, which had paid Harmonix $150 million following the success of &quot;Rock Band&quot; in 2007, began seeking a &quot;substantial&quot; refund on that investment after weak sales in 2009. Viacom also sought to negotiate new deals with music publishers to reduce the costs of the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series&#x27; licensed music. Ultimately, the company began to seek a buyer for Harmonix during the third quarter of 2010.

In 2010, rhythm game developers included new features in their products. For example, &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; and &quot;Power Gig: Rise of the SixString&quot; support guitar controllers with strings, and both contain modes that teach players accurate fingering. Despite this new content, sales of music games faltered in 2010. &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; and &quot;DJ Hero 2&quot; sold only 86,000 and 59,000 copies, respectively, in North America during their first week on the market. This was in sharp contrast to &quot;Guitar Hero III&quot;, which had sold nearly 1.4 million units in its first week in 2008. Through October 2010, music games achieved net sales of around $200 million, one-fifth of the genre&#x27;s revenue during the same period in 2008. Analysts believed that the market likely would not break $400 million in revenue by the end of the year. End year sales were less than $300 million.

By the end of 2010, the instrument controller-based rhythm market was considered &quot;well past its prime&quot;, and developers shifted their focus to downloadable content and potential integration with motion control systems. In late 2010, Viacom sold Harmonix to an investment-backed group and allowed it to continue developing &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Dance Central&quot;. Citing the downturn in rhythm games, Activision shuttered their &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; division in February 2011. Analysts suggested that the market for peripheral-based rhythm games may remain stagnant for three to five years, after which sales could resurge because of digital distribution models or the release of new video game consoles. However, by 2013, the era of peripheral-based music games was considered at an end, as Harmonix announced that it would cease regular updates of &quot;Rock Band&quot; downloadable content on April 2, 2013, as the company shifts to newer games.

=== Rhythm games for young girls (2004–present) ===
In Japanese amusement arcade, arcade-based collectible card games became popular. In 2004, Sega released Oshare Majo: Love and Berry which was a fashion coordinate game with collectible card game and rhythm game elements. The Oshare Majo was a big hit in Japan and then other game companies also entered in this game genre.
* Sega – Oshare Majo: Love and Berry (2004–2008) and LilPri (2009–2011)
* Taito – (2006–2007)
* Atlus – Kirarin Revolution: Happy Idol Life (2006–2009) and Gokujō!! Mecha Mote Iinchō: KuruMote Girls Contest! (2009–2011)
* Tomy – (2006–2010), Pretty Rhythm (2010–2014), PriPara (2014–2017), Idol Time PriPara (2017–2018), Kiratto Pri Chan (2018–2021), Waccha PriMagi! (2021–2024), and Himitsu no AiPri (2024–)
* Bandai – Pretty Cure: Data Carddass series (2007–2017) and Aikatsu! (2012–)
* Konami – Otocadoll (2015–2022)

Those games have only aimed at young girls, however some of those games also hit at some adults which are often mentioned as &quot;Ōkina otomodachi&quot; (lit. Big Friends). In 2016, as for PriPara, Tomy mentioned that &quot;When all users [of the game] are counted as its main target of from 6 to 9 years old [Japanese] girls, we succeed to expand the market scale as many as every one of the main target.&quot; in its financial results.

=== Virtual idol rhythm games (2008–present) ===
Virtual idol rhythm games grew in popularity in Japan out of two different media segments. One was &quot;The Idolmaster&quot; series of games developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment first released as an arcade game in 2005. Initial games had players taking the role of a manager of rising stars (idols) managing their schedules through mini-games, which include performing in auditions similar to a rhythm game approach. The other direction came from the introduction of the virtual idol of Hatsune Miku by Crypton Future Media for its line of Vocaloid sound synthesis software in 2007. Using Vocaloid, software users could have Miku mimic singing and dancing to the music created in Vocaloid, and many of these videos became popular on the Japanese media sharing site Niconico. The popularity of the Miku&#x27;s videos led to other similar videos based on other popular characters including those out of the &quot;Idolmaster&quot; series.

The next &quot;Idolmaster&quot; game, &quot;The Idolmaster Live For You!&quot; in 2008, focused more on the performance mini-games, which led for most remaining games of the series to be virtual idol rhythm games. Similarly, as Crypton continue to expand on Miku and other virtual idols for Vocaloid, they expanded to licensing those idols for video games, collaborating with Sega to create the &quot;Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA&quot; debuting in 2009.

These games were initially mostly for consoles, but mobile game versions of these series appeared in 2012 (&quot;Miku Flick&quot; for the Miku series) and 2013 (&quot;The Idolmaster Shiny Festa&quot;), and numerous mobile-based virtual idol rhythm games followed, such as &quot;Love Live!&quot;, &quot;BanG Dream!&quot;, &quot;Uta no Prince-sama&quot; and &quot;Ensemble Stars!&quot;. Many of these games were freemium games based on existing anime or manga properties, and typically included gacha-type mechanisms to be profitable.

=== Future directions (2010–present) ===

With the introduction of motion controllers for the Xbox 360 (Kinect) and the PlayStation 3 (PlayStation Move) in 2010 and 2011, some analysts stated that the rhythm market would resurge thanks to dance- and band-based games that use platform-agnostic controllers. Dance games such as Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Just Dance&quot;, Harmonix&#x27;s &quot;Dance Central&quot; and &quot;Michael Jackson: The Experience&quot; were based on new motion sensing technologies. Industry pundits believed that, because sales of peripheral-based music games are lagging and the popularity of pop music is surging, dance-based games would continue to thrive. &quot;Just Dance&quot; and &quot;Dance Central&quot; boosted the rhythm genre&#x27;s late-2010 sales; the latter was the top-selling game for the Kinect in North America in November 2010. Both games helped the genre increase its sales by 38% over November 2009, according to NPD. Harmonix is expected to post more than $100 million in profit for 2011 buoyed by sales of &quot;Dance Central&quot; and downloadable content for the game, according to Bloomberg. The first &quot;Just Dance&quot; game (2009) overcame a poor critical reception to topple &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;&#x27;s best-seller status, while &quot;Just Dance 2&quot; (2010) became the best selling non-Nintendo game for the Wii. The &quot;Just Dance&quot; series competed with top action franchises for sales. &quot;Tap Tap Revenge&quot;, the first installment of the iPhone rhythm series &quot;Tap Tap&quot;, was the platform&#x27;s most downloaded game in 2008. The &quot;Tap Tap&quot; franchise ultimately generated 15 million downloads and received a Guinness World Record as the &quot;most popular iPhone game series&quot;.

Over the course of 2014, the phenomenon of indie games produced several variations of the genre. The game Jungle Rumble uses a mechanic where players drum on a touch screen to control the game. Different rhythms correspond with different verbs to control entities in an RTS like environment. The game &quot;Crypt of the NecroDancer&quot; uses a mechanic where the player controls the main character in sync with the soundtrack&#x27;s beat.

Harmonix returned to its core rhythm games in 2014. In 2014, it successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign to produce a remake of the PS2 title, &quot;Amplitude&quot; for PlayStation 3 and 4, with release expected in 2015. Further, in March 2015, the company announced &quot;Rock Band 4&quot; to be released later in the same year, with plans to keep the game as a platform with continued free and paid updates and downloadable content, while refocusing on the core social and music enjoyment of the game. Activision also announced &quot;Guitar Hero Live&quot;, slated for late 2015, which rebuilds the game from the ground up, keeping the core mechanics but using a 3-button with dual position controller, and using recorded footage of a rock concert taken from the lead guitarist&#x27;s perspective to increase immersion. Guitar rhythm game industry is going for the VR market with games like &quot;Rocksmith&quot; and&quot; Rock Band VR&quot;.

2016 saw the release of &quot;Thumper&quot;, a self-styled &quot;rhythm violence&quot; game combining rhythm mechanics with an abstract horror theme and an original industrial soundtrack. Unusually, &quot;Thumper&quot; features a player character encountering notes as physical obstacles, rather than having notes simply scroll offscreen. Also in 2016, Konami returned to the western arcade market with &quot;Dance Dance Revolution A&quot; after a successful location test.

In 2017, Step Revolution released &quot;StepManiaX&quot;, a game similar to DDR and &quot;In the Groove&quot;, with an additional center panel. The game currently releases monthly updates.

In 2018, &quot;Beat Saber&quot;, a virtual reality rhythm game designed around cutting colored cubes in time with a song&#x27;s beat, became the top selling and highest rated virtual reality game on the Steam market at the time of its release.

In 2019, the rhythm genre made its first foray into the first-person shooter genre with Harmonix&#x27;s AUDICA. This same formula would then be used again for 2019&#x27;s &quot;Pistol Whip&quot;, 2020&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and 2022&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Harmonix was acquired by Epic Games in 2021, and worked on a new rhythm-based game mode called &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot;, mimicking the gameplay of &quot;Rock Band&quot;, released within Epic&#x27;s &quot;Fortnite&quot; game platform in 2023.

== Health and education ==
Rhythm games have been used for health purposes. For example, research has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games, and that they burn more calories than walking on a treadmill. Scientists have further suggested that, due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television, games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity.

Studies have found that playing &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; can provide an aerobic workout, in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate, but not the minimum levels of VO2 max. Based on successful preliminary studies, West Virginia, which has one of the highest rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US, introduced &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; into its schools&#x27; physical education classes. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, more than &quot;several hundred schools in at least 10 states&quot; have used &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; (along with &quot;In the Groove&quot;) in their curricula. Plans have been made to increase the number into the thousands in an effort to mitigate the country&#x27;s obesity epidemic. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California, was a noted proponent of the game&#x27;s use in schools.

In Japan, celebrities reported losing weight after playing &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, which drove sales of the game&#x27;s home console version. Bemani&#x27;s testers also found themselves losing weight while working on the game.

There is further anecdotal evidence that these games aid weight loss, though the University of Michigan Health System has cautioned that dance games and other exergames should only be a starting point towards traditional sports, which are more effective.

Dance games have also been used in rehabilitation and fall-prevention programs for elderly patients, using customised, slower versions of existing games and mats. Researchers have further experimented with prototypes of games allowing wider and more realistic stepping than the tapping actions found in commercial dance games.

MIT students collaborated with the government of Singapore and a professor at the National University of Singapore to create &quot;AudiOdyssey&quot;, a game which allows both blind and sighted gamers to play together.

=== &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and related games ===
&quot;Guitar Hero&quot; games have been used alongside physical therapy to help recovering stroke patients, because of the multiple limb coordination that the titles require. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have used &quot;Guitar Hero III&quot; and its controller to help amputee patients, and to develop new prosthetic limbs for these patients. Researchers at University of Nevada, Reno modified a haptic feedback glove to work with the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; freeware clone &quot;Frets on Fire&quot;, resulting in &quot;Blind Hero&quot;, a music game for visually impaired players that is played with only touch and audio. &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; was used as part of a Trent University youth sleep study, which showed that, in general, players who played a song were better at it twelve hours later if that period included normal sleep.

&quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; have introduced people to rock music and inspired them to learn how to play the guitar. A study by Youth Music found that 2.5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;. The group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs.

Guitar teachers in the US have reported an increase in students who cite &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; as their inspiration to start learning. On the other hand, industry professionals, such as the inventor of the Fretlight practice tool, have expressed scepticism over the game&#x27;s educational value. There is anecdotal evidence that &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; aids rhythm and general hand-coordination, but also that it creates a false preconception of the difficulty of learning guitar, which can lead students to discontinue their studies. Guitar Center conducted a survey which found that a majority of instrument-based rhythm gamers intended to take up a real instrument in the future while a majority of those who were already musicians had been inspired to play their instruments more. Despite such popularity the guitar remains less popular than it was in the 1960s.

Some musicians have been critical of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;&#x27;s impact on music education. Jack White of the White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts. Similarly, Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series, stating that he felt that it was &quot;more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar&quot;. Other commentators have pointed to drum controllers (including the expanded, lifelike Drum Rocker kit) used in such games as potentially useful in learning and creating music with real drums.

<text>Centaurium (centaury) is a genus of 20 species in the gentian family (Gentianaceae), tribe Chironieae, subtribe Chironiinae. The genus was named after the centaur Chiron, famed in Greek mythology for his skill in medicinal herbs. It is distributed across Europe and Asia.

Until 2004, &quot;Centaurium&quot; was given a much wider circumscription, comprising about 50 species ranging across Europe, Asia, the Americas, Australasia, and the Pacific. However this circumscription was polyphyletic, so in 2004 the genus was split into four, being &quot;Centaurium&quot; sensu stricto, &quot;Zeltnera&quot;, &quot;Gyrandra&quot; , and &quot;Schenkia&quot;.

==Species==
According to Plants of the World Online there are 24 species of &quot;Centaurium&quot;.

<doc id="939228" wikidata="Q1780946" url="?curid=939228" title="Lincoln Versailles">
<text>The Lincoln Versailles is a mid-size luxury car that was marketed by Lincoln from the 1977 to 1980 model years. The first Lincoln introduced outside of the full-size segment, the Versailles is a rebranded version of the Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch. Replacing the Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the model line was introduced as a competitor to the Cadillac Seville. 

Deriving its nameplate from the French palace outside Paris, the Lincoln Versailles was offered solely as a four-door sedan; it is the final vehicle developed from the chassis architecture of the American Ford Falcon.

From 1977 to 1980, Ford produced the Lincoln Versailles alongside the Granada and Monarch at Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly (Wayne, Michigan) and Mahwah Assembly (Mahwah, New Jersey), with production totaling 50,156.

== Origin of name ==
During the mid-1950s, a Ford Versailles was manufactured by Simca in France, derived from the Ford Vedette.

In 1966, during the development of what would become the Continental Mark III, Ford researched the suitability of multiple nameplates for the model line with potential consumers. The Versailles name placed third (after Mark VI and LeMarque) among a large group of nameplates. Though Ford ultimately sought to restart the chronology of the Mark series with Mark III, the company held onto the name, keeping it for the 1977 Lincoln Versailles.

== Background ==
During the mid-1970s, the Lincoln division of Ford sought to expand its model range for multiple reasons. Though sales of large luxury cars would ultimately recover in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, in the United States, the rise of imported cars also led to transition in the luxury-vehicle segment. While competing with Cadillac, Imperial, and Lincoln in terms of price, the West German BMW 3.0Si and Mercedes-Benz 350SE/450SE and the British Jaguar XJ offered American luxury car customers a far different vehicle than produced by Ford, GM, or Chrysler.

In 1973, the Lincoln Mark I Ghia concept car was developed by Ghia, derived from the Ford Granada Mk I.

For 1976, the Cadillac Seville was introduced in May 1975. Developed by GM (in only 16 months) in response to both the fuel crises and in effort to match European luxury sedans, the Seville sourced its V8 engine from Oldsmobile and its chassis underpinnings from the Chevrolet Nova. The smallest Cadillac in 40 years, the Seville broke a long-running industry precedent, as the near-compact model Cadillac was its most expensive (non-limousine) sedan.

Coinciding with the launch of the Seville, Ford began development of a Lincoln-branded competitor to the model line, tasked with bringing the model line to market for the 1977 model year. Adopting the Lincoln Versailles name, Ford used the body architecture of the Ford Granada/Mercury Monarch compact sedans, introduced for 1975. Sized closely against the GM X-body compacts, the Granada/Monarch were developed to replace the Ford Maverick/Mercury Comet. With little over than a year until its product launch, the Versailles was relegated to become a variant of a production vehicle, sharing a large degree of its body panels with its Mercury counterpart. To further streamline development, the Versailles adopted the design features of the highest-trim Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia (which was discontinued for 1977).

In line with the Seville, the Versailles was the most expensive Lincoln sedan at $11,500 ($ in dollars ); Lincoln-Mercury priced the model line $2000 under the Seville, keeping the model line below the Continental Mark V in price. The first Lincoln manufactured outside of Wixom Assembly since 1957, the Versailles was produced alongside the Mercury Monarch and Ford Granada. The model was notable for being the first production vehicle to be sold with clearcoat paint and halogen headlights in North America.

== Overview ==
The Lincoln Versailles marked the first time since 1960 that Lincoln offered two sedan lines. Nearly three feet shorter than the Continental, the model line was offered only as a four-door sedan.

=== Exterior ===

Offered only as a four-door sedan, the Versailles shared many visible body panels with the Monarch and Granada, including the entire roofline. Several design elements were revised, giving the Versailles an appearance closer in line to the Continental and Mark V, including a &quot;Continental spare&quot; decklid (with LINCOLN lettering) and model-specific taillamps; the Versailles (the first Lincoln with exposed headlamps since 1969) introduced rectangular headlamps to the brand.

For 1979, the model line received a revised roofline, distinct from the Granada/Monarch. Developed by American Sunroof Company, a fiberglass cap on the rear roof and reshaped rear doors gave the model line a notchback appearance (a vinyl landau roof was now standard).

=== Interior ===
Essentially taking over the role of the Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the Lincoln Versailles inherited many standard interior features, including many seen in the larger Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Continental. Along with power-operated leather-trim seats and steering wheel, power steering and windows, the Versailles included features such as a digital LCD clock, dual map lights, lighted passenger vanity mirror, rear-seat map pockets, and plush carpeting with soundproofing.

=== Chassis ===
The Versailles shares its wheelbase with the Ford Granada/Mercury Monarch and the four-door Ford Maverick/Mercury Comet. Marketed as a compact car, the Versailles is closer in size to the mid-size segment of today, in terms of exterior footprint.

According to Lincoln advertising, a quality-control regimen was used at the factory. According to the marketing, final assembly included dynamometer testing of the engine/transmission, a water spray test to pinpoint body leaks, and a simulated road test. The Versailles featured &quot;matched and balanced&quot; driveline elements, low-friction lower ball joints, double isolated shocks, reinforced chassis areas, sound insulation, and balanced forged 14-inch aluminum wheels with Michelin whitewall X-radials. Bodywork received the first clear-coat paint on a regular production car.”

The Versailles shared its powertrain with the Monarch upon which it was based, with a V8 engine as a sole choice. Initially, the Versailles was powered by the 351 cubic-inch V8, phased out in favor of the 302 cubic-inch V8. The three-speed C4 automatic transmission was the only transmission available. The rear differential used in the Versailles was Ford 9-inch with rear disc brakes, replacing the drums used on the Granada and the Monarch.
== Sales ==
In comparison to the Cadillac Seville, the Lincoln Versailles fared poorly, outsold by the Cadillac by a three to one margin in its 1977 debut year. Following its update for the 1979 model year, sales of the Versailles would more than double, though remaining far behind its Cadillac counterpart.

In its entire production run, Lincoln would sell 50,156 examples of the Versailles. By comparison, Cadillac would outsell that total in both 1978 and 1979, the last two years of the first-generation Seville.

Lincoln would temporarily revert to an all-full-size lineup for 1981 before introducing a downsized, Fox-based Continental for 1982.

<text>The Transformation Story Archive (TSA) was a website archiving amateur fiction featuring a personal physical transformation or its aftermath. The archive was created by Austrian web designer Thomas Hassan, who intended it to be a premier showcase for transformation-themed fiction and a showcase for amateur authors. The TSA was operating at least as early as May 1995, leading to claims of being the earliest Internet archive for fiction of this genre. 
==Included content==
Although a wide variety of metamorphoses were considered suitable content for inclusion, transgender and furry wish-fulfillment stories predominated. The archive&#x27;s community also created or fostered a large number of shared universe fiction settings, in part due to a prohibition against traditional fanfiction. One of the biggest of these, &quot;Tales from the Blind Pig&quot;, was represented by hundreds of stories contributed by dozens of authors over the life of the archive. Some stories on the archive contained controversial themes, such as age regression or overtly sexual content.

==History==
During its heyday, the TSA inspired the creation of countless similar sites, often with narrower focuses. Its high volume of amateur fiction also led to its inclusion in lists of ezines, although it was never actually structured in that manner. In 1997, eSCENE, an annual award anthology for works first published in ezines, invited nominations from the TSA, and considered 17 such stories, the most from any single source. Fiction written in the TSA&#x27;s shared universes have at times also been accepted in unrelated online anthologies. Its content has been cited as inspiration or influence by others in the genres the archive included, from the USENET community that pioneered modern therianthropy to creators of webcomics such as &quot;Zebra Girl&quot;.

==Accusations==
The success of the TSA accounted for a significant portion of the Internet traffic of its non-profit server in Vienna, run by hosting service public netbase/t0. A shift to the right in Austrian politics worked against the site and its host, however. Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) leader Jörg Haider selected &quot;degenerate art&quot; as one target for his party&#x27;s political capital. By July 1998, this included accusations of the acceptance and facilitation of child pornography against public netbase/t0. Initially, the FPÖ explicitly alleged links between public netbase/t0 and a separate hosting service from the British Virgin Islands, but the sexual content of the TSA and its age-alteration themes was implicitly included when allegations continued after that connection was refuted. When the results of these attacks stripped its host of public funding and free access, the TSA hastily relocated to an American server, assisted by several mirror servers.

==Server relocation==
However, the TSA would never recover as a community from the server relocation. The shift from Austrian to North American hosting led to the departure of Hassan from the project; he went on to join Austrian software developer Public Voice Lab, eventually earning a seat on their board. Posting of new content to the archive finally stopped in July 2003 and the archive&#x27;s users have largely moved to other websites or dropped from public view, although the site remains available as of October 2022. Much of the content has been redistributed, both during and after the TSA&#x27;s active existence, however. Its sister-project mailing list continued under separate administration long after the stagnation of the actual web archive, and an ezine continued for some years, hosted on the current TSA server (and still there for archival purposes). And, despite its long inactivity, the TSA remains on most lists of sources for furry, transgender, or metamorphosis-themed fiction, and still receives occasional mention in wider indexes of online fiction sites.

==Archive==
Although the original archive has been inactive since 2003, the TSA Mailing list still sees new stories added regularly by old members of the TSA community, as well as newcomers. A project by members of the mailing list to produce a successor to the original Transformation Story Archive was started in 2007 at Shifti.org.

<text>The Butterfly Cluster (cataloged as Messier 6 or M6, and as NGC 6405) is an open cluster of stars in the southern constellation of Scorpius. Its name derives from the resemblance of its shape to a butterfly.

The first astronomer to record the Butterfly Cluster&#x27;s existence was Giovanni Battista Hodierna in 1654. However, Robert Burnham Jr. has proposed that the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy may have seen it with the naked eye while observing its neighbor the Ptolemy Cluster (M7). Credit for the discovery is usually given to Jean-Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1746. Charles Messier observed the cluster on May 23, 1764, and added it to his Messier Catalog.

Estimates of the Butterfly Cluster&#x27;s distance have varied over the years. Wu et al. (2009) found a distance estimate of , giving it a spatial dimension of some 12 light years. Modern measurements show its total visual brightness to be magnitude 4.2. The cluster is estimated to be 94.2 million years old. Cluster members show a slightly higher abundance of elements heavier than helium compared to the Sun; what astronomers refer to as the metallicity.

120 stars, ranging down to visual magnitude 15.1, have been identified as most likely cluster members. Most of the bright stars in this cluster are hot, blue B-type stars but the brightest member is a K-type orange giant star, BM Scorpii, which contrasts sharply with its blue neighbours in photographs. BM Scorpii, is classed as a semiregular variable star, its brightness varying from magnitude +5.5 to magnitude +7.0. There are also eight candidate chemically peculiar stars.

The cluster is located from the Galactic Center and is following an orbit through the Milky Way galaxy with a low eccentricity of 0.03 and an orbital period of 204.2 Myr. At present it is below the galactic plane, and it will cross the plane every 29.4 Myr.

<text>Hindu views of homosexuality and LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) issues more generally are diverse, and different Hindu groups have distinct views. Hinduism describes a third gender that is equal to other genders and documentation of the third gender are found in ancient Hindu and Buddhist medical texts. The Kamasutra mentions Hijras and relations with them, and there are several Hindu temples which have carvings that depict both men and women engaging in sexual acts with Hijras. There are numerous cases of Hindu deities and figures that had physically transformed to different genders. 

The Arthashastra argues that homosexual intercourse is an offence, and encourages chastity. The Dharmashastra recognises the existence of homosexuality, and openly condemns non-vaginal sex in religious or moral terms. The Manusmriti regards homosexual (as well as heterosexual) acts in an ox cart as a source of ritual pollution. These commentaries were written as guides for sexual misconduct (heterosexual and homosexual). In the Manusmirti and the Arthashastra of Kautilya, homosexual contact is compared to having sex with menstruating woman, which is sinful and demands a purification ritual. The Dharmashastras perceives advantage of conceiving sons by heterosexual marriage, the Dharmsastras are against non-vaginal sex like the Vashistha Dharmasutra. The Yājñavalkya Smṛti prescribes fines for such acts including those with other men.

The Manusmriti provides punishment to homosexual men and women. Manusmriti says that if a girl has sex with another girl, she is liable for a fine of two hundred coins and ten whiplashes. But if lesbian sex is performed by a mature woman on a girl, her head should be shaved or two of her fingers cut off as punishment. The woman should also be made to ride on a donkey. In the case of homosexual males, Manusmriti says that sexual union between with two men brings loss of caste. If a man has sex with non-human females or with another man or indulges in anal or oral sex with women he is liable for punishment as per the &quot;Painful Heating Vow&quot;.

Arthashastra of Kautilya a treatise on politics mentions homosexuality. But says its the duty of the king to punish those indulging in homosexuality and expects the ruler to fight against the &quot;social evil&quot;.

In the Mahābhārata it disapproves of sex between men. The words used are viyoni maithuna (13.145.53) this means sex (maithuna) which is other than vaginal (viyoni). Śiva tells Pārvatī that one who performs such an act will be born impotent. A similar statement is made in the next verse (13.145.54). The words used are prakīrṇa-maithuna common meanings of this word are scattered, dispersed, mixed, confused, loose, and miscellaneous.

There have been cases of some Hindu priests performing same sex marriages in temples since the independence from colonialism, although the majority continue to oppose it. 

In 2009, the Delhi High Court legalised homosexuality in India, but the Supreme Court of India subsequently overturned the high court&#x27;s decision. The Supreme Court of India, in a later ruling in 2018, reversed its previous verdict and decriminalised homosexual intercourse and relationships. However, in November 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have no legal right to marry each other.

==Contemporary Hindu society==
Sexuality is rarely discussed openly in contemporary Hindu society, especially in modern India where homosexuality was illegal until a brief period beginning in 1860, due to colonial British laws. In 2009, The Delhi High Court in a historic judgement decriminalised homosexuality in India; where the court noted that the existing laws violated fundamental rights to personal liberty (Article 21 of the Indian Constitution) and equality (Article 14) and prohibition of discrimination (Article 15). However, the Supreme Court of India re-affirmed the penal code provision and overturned the Delhi High Court decision, effectively re-instating the legal ban on homosexuality in which penalties included life imprisonment until September 6, 2018, when Supreme Court of India decriminalised homosexuality. Furthermore, LGBT people are often subjected to torture, executions and fines by non-government affiliated vigilante groups.

Hindu nationalist factions have a varied opinion on the legalisation of homosexuality. In the last thirty years, homosexuality has become increasingly visible in the print and audio-visual media, with many out LGBT people, an active LGBT movement, and a large Indian LGBT presence on the Internet. From the 1990s onward, modern gay and lesbian Hindu organizations have surfaced in India&#x27;s major cities and in 2004, plausible calls were made for the first time to repeal India&#x27;s laws against homosexuality.

Deepa Mehta&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Fire&quot;, which depicts a romantic relationship between two Hindu women, was informally banned for &quot;religious insensitivity&quot; after the screening of the movie was disrupted on the grounds that it denigrated Indian culture, not on the grounds of homophobia per se, a position shared and confirmed by feminist Madhu Kishwar. In addition, Bharatiya Janata Party who were in power in India at the time, refused to ban it. Similar protests occurred in 2004 against the lesbian-themed film &quot;Girlfriend&quot; — even though the portrayal of lesbianism was this time distinctly unsympathetic. Several human-rights groups such as the People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties have asserted that sexual minorities in India face severe discrimination and violence, especially those from rural and lower-caste backgrounds.

In her book, &quot;Love&#x27;s Rite&quot;, Ruth Vanita examines the phenomenon of same-sex weddings, many by Hindu rites, which have been reported by the Indian press over the last thirty years and with increasing frequency. In the same period, same-sex joint suicides have also been reported. Most of these marriages and suicides are by lower-middle-class female couples from small towns and rural areas across the country; these women have no contact with any LGBT movements. Both cross-sex and same-sex couples, when faced with family opposition, tend to resort to either elopement and marriage or to joint suicide in the hope of reunion in the next life. Vanita examines how Hindu doctrines such as rebirth and the genderlessness of the soul are often interpreted to legitimize socially disapproved relationships, including same-sex ones. In a 2004 survey, most — though not all — swamis said they opposed the concept of a Hindu-sanctified gay marriage. But several Hindu priests have performed same-sex marriages, arguing that love is the result of attachments from previous births and that marriage, as a union of spirit, is transcendental to gender.

Later, Vanita condenses the ideas in her book into an article, &quot;Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions and Modern India&quot;. Here, she summarizes specific cases in which women specifically committed joint-suicides, were married and separated, or successfully married. She points out three different &quot;forces that have helped female couples&quot;. These are: the law courts, the media, and some Hindu authorities (such as the swamis mentioned earlier in this article) from her book. When female couples can stay together under the social pressures and get to the courts, the courts generally hold up their decisions, holding to the fact that the women are consenting adults. While this does not necessarily stop the harassment, it does lend the couple further legitimacy under the laws. In addition, the more successful same-sex marriages of women are those in which the women are financially independent. If they have social support from their families and community—for the most part—then they may be able to live in peace together. The media may also play an important role in same-sex marriages. In drawing attention to their marriages, women who do not necessarily know about LGBT rights groups may be contacted and supported by those groups after media attention. However, the flip side of this is that the anti-LGBT groups also may reach out against their marriage.

Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar writes that Hindus are more accepting of &quot;deviance or eccentricity&quot; that are adherents of Western religions, who typically treat sexual variance as &quot;anti-social or psychopathological, requiring &#x27;correction&#x27; or &#x27;cure&#x27;&quot;. Hindus, he argues, believe instead that each individual must fulfill their personal destiny (&quot;svadharma&quot;) as they travel the path towards moksha (transcendence).

Commenting on the legalisation of homosexuality in India; Anil Bhanot, general secretary of The United Kingdom Hindu Council said: &quot;The point here is that the homosexual nature is part of the natural law of God; it should be accepted for what it is, no more and no less. Hindus are generally conservative but it seems to me that in ancient India, they even celebrated sex as an enjoyable part of procreation, where priests were invited for ceremonies in their home to mark the beginning of the process.&quot;

==The third gender==
Hindu philosophy has the concept of a third sex or third gender (Sanskrit: तृतीय प्रकृति, &quot;tŕtīya-prakŕti&quot; – literally, &quot;third nature&quot;). This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as effeminate males, masculine females, transgender people, transsexual people, intersex people, androgynes, and so on. Many MTF third-genders are not attracted only or at all to men, but are attracted either exclusively to women or are bisexual. Many FTM transgender people are attracted to men. Such persons are not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth) and are not expected to behave like cisgender men and women. They often keep their own societies or town quarters, perform specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and are generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as cross-dressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others. 

In 2008, the state of Tamil Nadu recognised the &quot;Third Gender&quot;; with its civil supplies department giving in the ration card a provision for a new sex column as &#x27;T&#x27;, distinct from the usual &#x27;M&#x27; and &#x27;F&#x27; for males and females respectively. This was the first time that authorities anywhere in India have officially recognised the third gender.

==Hindu religious narratives==
In the Hindu narrative tradition, stories of gods and mortals changing gender occur. Sometimes they also engage in heterosexual activities as different reincarnated genders. Homosexual and transgender Hindus commonly identify with and worship the various Hindu deities connected with gender diversity such as Ardhanarisvara (the androgynous form of Shiva and his consort Parvati), Aravan (a hero whom the god Krishna married after becoming a woman), Harihara (an incarnation of Shiva and Vishnu combined), Bahuchara Mata (a goddess connected with transsexuality and eunuchism), Gadadhara (an incarnation of Radha in male form), Chandi-Chamunda (twin warrior goddesses), Bhagavati-devi (a Hindu goddess associated with cross-dressing), Gangamma (a goddess connected with cross-dressing and disguises) and the goddess Yellamma. There are also specific festivals connected to the worship of these deities, some of which are famous in India for their cross-dressing devotees. These festivals include the Aravan Festival of Koovagam, the Bahuchara Mata Festivals of Gujarat and the Yellamma Festivals of Karnataka, among others. Deities displaying gender variance include Mohini, the female avatar of the god Vishnu and Vaikuntha Kamalaja, the androgynous form of Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi.

LGBT interpretations are also drawn in the legends of birth of the deities Ayyappa (a god born from the union of Shiva and Mohini), Bhagiratha (an Indian king born of two female parents) and Kartikeya (where the fire-god Agni &quot;swallows&quot; the semen of Shiva after disturbing his coitus with his consort Parvati). Some homosexual Hindus also worship the gods Mitra and Varuna, who are associated with two lunar phases and same-sex relations in ancient Brahmana texts.

Gender variance is also observed in heroes in Hindu scriptures. The Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; narrates that the hero Arjuna takes a vow to live as a member of the third sex for a year as the result of a curse he is compelled to honor. He thus transforms into Brihannala, a member of the third gender, for a year and becomes a dance teacher to a princess. Another important character, Shikhandi, is born female, but raised as a man and even married to a woman. She becomes male due to the grace of a Yaksha. Shikhandi eventually becomes the reason for the death of the warrior Bhishma, who refuses to fight a &quot;woman.&quot; Another character, Bhishma appeases Yudhishtira&#x27;s curiosity about relative enjoyment of partners during sex by relating the story of King Bhangasvana, who has had a hundred sons is turned into a woman while on a hunt. She returns to her kingdom, relates the story, turns the kingdom over to her children and retires to the forest to be the spouse of a hermit, by whom she has a hundred more sons. Ila, a king from Hindu narratives, is also known for their gender changes.

Some versions of the &quot;Krittivasa Ramayana&quot;, the most popular Bengali text on the pastimes of Ramachandra (an incarnation of Vishnu), relate a story of two queens who conceived a child together. When the king of the Sun Dynasty, Maharaja Dilipa, died, the demigods become concerned that he did not have a son to continue his line. Shiva, therefore, appeared before the king&#x27;s two widowed queens and commanded them, &quot;You two make love together and by my blessings, you will bear a beautiful son.&quot; The two wives, with great affection for each other, executed Shiva&#x27;s order until one of them conceived a child. The sage Astavakra accordingly named the child &quot;Bhagiratha&quot; – he who was born from two vulvas. Bhagiratha later became a king and is credited with bringing the river Ganges down to earth through his austerities.

==Hindu texts==

People of a third gender (&quot;tritiya-prakriti&quot;), not fully men nor women, are mentioned here and there throughout Hindu texts such as the Puranas but are not specifically defined. In general, they are portrayed as effeminate men, often cowardly, and with no desire for women. Modern readers often draw parallels between these and modern stereotypes of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. However, Hindu texts (Mostly Dharmasastras) such as the Manusmriti, Vide Atri Smřti, Vide Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra, and the Vide Apastambha Dharmasūtra do treat homosexual sex (as well as heterosexual sex) as a sin, in some cases legally punishable.

Historians Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai, in their book &quot;Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History&quot;, compiled extracts from Indian texts, from ancient to modern times, including many Hindu texts, translated from 15 Indian languages. In their accompanying analytical essays, they also wrote that Hindu texts have discussed and debated same-sex desire from the earliest times, in tones ranging from critical to non-judgmental to playful and celebratory.

===Kama Sutra===

The Kama Sutra is an ancient text dealing with &quot;kama&quot; or desire (of all kinds), which in Hindu thought is one of the four normative and spiritual goals of life. The Kama Sutra is the earliest extant and most important work in the Kama Shastra tradition of Sanskrit literature. It was compiled by the philosopher Vatsyayana around the 4th century, from earlier texts, and describes Third gender practices in several places, as well as a range of sex/gender &#x27;types&#x27;. The author acknowledges that these relations also involve love and a bond of trust.

The author describes techniques by which masculine and feminine types of the third sex (&quot;tritiya-prakriti&quot;), as well as women, perform fellatio. The Second Part, Ninth Chapter of Kama Sutra specifically describes two kinds of men that we would recognize today as masculine- and feminine-type homosexuals but which are mentioned in older, Victorian British translations as simply &quot;eunuchs.&quot; The chapter describes their appearances – feminine types dressed up as women whereas masculine types maintained muscular physiques and grew small beards, mustaches, etc. – and their various professions as masseurs, barbers and prostitutes are all described. Such Third gender people were also known to marry, according to the Kama Sutra: &quot;There are also third-sex citizens, sometimes greatly attached to one another and with complete faith in one another, who get married together.&quot; (KS 2.9.36). In the &quot;Jayamangala&quot; of Yashodhara, an important twelfth-century commentary on the Kama Sutra, it is also stated: &quot;Citizens with this kind of inclination, can do without them willingly because they love one another, get married together, bound by a deep and trusting friendship.&quot;

===Dharmsastras===

Hindu gurus in Ancient India often offered commentary on how society should be run, but these commentaries were often not implemented in a moral or legal sense, and often referred to moral conduct for the upper class of monks and priests who were expected to refrain from sex rather than the lay people.

==== Manusmriti ====
In the &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, there are proposals for various punishments for homosexual sex in certain cases (along with heterosexual sex too). A mature woman having sex with a maiden girl was punished by having her head shaved or two of her fingers cut off, and she was also made to ride on a donkey. In the case of homosexual male sex, the Manusmriti dictated that sexual union between two people (both homosexual and heterosexual) in a bullock cart as a source of ritual pollution. Verses 8.369-370 of Manusmriti which prescribe punishment for a female having intercourse with a maiden are wrongly thought to be against same-sex activity between females by some modern authors like Wendy Doniger. However, verse 8.367 contains a similar punishment for all those who do it regardless of gender. The emphasis Vanita states here is on a maiden&#x27;s sexual purity. The Manusmriti is less judgmental about LGBT relationships. XI. 174 prescribes eating the five products of the cow or Panchagavya and foregoing food for a night for several sexual acts committed by a man including those with other men. XI. 175 states that those men who engage in intercourse with a man should take a bath while being clothed. According to XI.68, a man who engages in such acts is traditionally considered to lose his caste, though Ruth Vanita suggests the prescriptions by Manusmriti act as a substitute.

Scholars doubt that the Manusmitri was implemented prior to colonialism, after which it became the basis of British colonial law for Hindus (in opposition to the Sharia Law for Muslims).

==== Others ====
The Dharmsastras especially later ones prescribed against non-vaginal sex like the Vashistha Dharmasutra. The Yājñavalkya Smṛti prescribes fines for such acts including those with other men.

===Other scriptures===
The Sushruta Samhita also mentions the possibility of two women uniting and becoming pregnant as a result of the mingling of their sexual fluids. It states that the child born of such a union will be &quot;boneless.&quot; Such a birth is indeed described in the Krittivasa Ramayana of Bengal (see below).

Other texts list the various types of men who are impotent with women (known in Sanskrit as &quot;sandha&quot;, &quot;kliba&quot;, &quot;napumsaka&quot;, and &quot;panda&quot;). The &quot;Sabda-kalpa-druma&quot; Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary, for instance, lists twenty types, as does the &quot;Kamatantra&quot; and &quot;Smriti-Ratnavali&quot; of Vacaspati (14th century). The Narada Smriti similarly lists fourteen different types. Included among the lists are transgender people (&quot;sandha&quot;), intersex people (&quot;nisarga&quot;), and three different types of homosexual men (&quot;mukhebhaga&quot;, &quot;kumbhika&quot; and &quot;asekya&quot;). Such texts demonstrate that third-sex terms like &quot;sandha&quot; and &quot;napumsaka&quot; actually refer to many different types of &quot;men who are impotent with women,&quot; and that simplistic definition such as &quot;eunuch&quot; or &quot;neuter&quot; may not always be accurate and in some cases totally incorrect. In his article &quot;Homosexuality and Hinduism&quot;, Arvind Sharma expresses his doubt over the common English translation of words like &quot;kliba&quot; into &quot;eunuch&quot; as follows: &quot;The limited practice of castration in India raises another point significant for the rest of the discussion, namely, whether rendering a word such as &quot;kliba&quot; as &quot;eunuch&quot; regularly is correct...&quot;

The Arthashastra of Kautilya represents the principle text of secular law and illustrates the attitude of the judiciary towards sexual matters. Heterosexual vaginal sex is proposed as the norm by this text and legal issues arising from deviation therefrom are punishable by fines and in extreme cases by capital punishment. Homosexual acts are cited as a small offence punishable by a fine. It punishes non-vaginal sex with a small fine (4; 23; 326); however, women are fined less than men.

The digest or &quot;dharmanibandha&quot; work &quot;Dandaviveka&#x27;&quot; written by Vardhamana Upadhyaya in 15th century in Mithila pronounced that semen shouldn&#x27;t ejaculate outside the vagina. &quot;Ayoni&quot; sex here is divided into two categories, one which includes intercourse with humans of both genders.

The Narada Purana in 1.15.936 states that those who have non-vaginal intercourse will go to Retobhojana where they have to live on semen. Ruth Vanita states that the punishment in the afterlife suggested by it is comical and befitting the act. The Skanda Purana states that those who indulge in such acts will acquire impotency.

==Third-gender Hindu sects==
Below are listed some of the most common third-gender sects found in Hinduism. There are an estimated half million crossdressing &quot;eunuchs&quot; in modern-day India, associated with various sects, temples and Hindu deities. Despite being called &quot;eunuchs&quot;, the majority of these persons (91%) do not practice castration but are more accurately associated with transgender.

===The Hijra===
The &quot;Hijras&quot; are a third-gender group in the Indian subcontinent. Some of them undergo castration, which is connected to Bahuchara Mata who is identified with the earth goddess. According to legends, she cut off her breasts in order to avoid rape by a group of bandits. The operation is termed by them &quot;nirvan&quot;. They compare it with &quot;tapas&quot; which consists of avoiding sex. Also used to justify emasculation is a creation myth of Shiva who emasculated himself. The aravanis also undergo castration. Hijras also use Arjuna becoming a eunuch during exile as a result of a curse as a justification for castration. Despite this, all the seven major hijra clans are claimed to have been established by Muslims.

There are an estimated 50,000 &quot;hijra&quot; in northern India. After interviewing and studying the &quot;hijra&quot; for many years, Serena Nanda writes in her book, &quot;Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India&quot;, as follows: &quot;There is a widespread belief in India that &quot;hijras&quot; are born intersex and are taken away by the &quot;hijra&quot; community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the &quot;hijras&quot; I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens.&quot; Nanda also states: &quot;There is absolutely no question that at least some &quot;hijras&quot; – perhaps even the majority – are homosexual prostitutes. Sinha&#x27;s (1967) study of &quot;hijras&quot; in Lucknow, in North India, acknowledges the &quot;hijra&quot; role as performers, but views the major motivation for recruitment to the &quot;hijra&quot; community as the satisfaction of the individual&#x27;s homosexual urges...&quot; The &quot;hijras&quot; especially worship Bahuchara, the Hindu goddess presiding over transsexuality.

===The Aravani or Ali===

The most numerous third-gender sect (estimated at 150,000) is the &quot;aravani&quot; or &quot;ali&quot; of Tamil Nadu in southern India. The &quot;aravanis&quot; are typically transgender and their main festival, the popular Koovagam or Aravan Festival celebrated in late April/early May, is attended by thousands, including many transgender people and homosexuals. The &quot;aravani&quot; worship the Hindu god, Aravan, and do not practice any system of castration.

===The Jogappa===
A lesser-known third-gender sect in India is the &quot;jogappa&quot; of South India (Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh), a group similarly associated with prostitution. The &quot;jogappa&quot; are connected with the goddess Yellamma (Renuka), and include both transgender people and homosexuals. Both serve as dancers and prostitutes, and they are usually in charge of the temple &quot;devadasis&quot; (maidservants of the goddess who similarly serve as dancers and female courtesans). Large festivals are celebrated at these temples wherein hundreds of scantily-clad &quot;devadasis&quot; and &quot;jogappas&quot; parade through the streets. The &quot;jogappa&quot; do not practice castration.

==Religious art==

Medieval Hindu temples such as those at Khajuraho depict sexual acts in sculptures on the external walls. Some of these scenes involve same-sex sexuality:
* A sculpture at the Kandariya Mahadeva temple in Khajuraho portrays a man reaching out to another&#x27;s erect penis.
* An orgiastic group of three women and one man, on the southern wall of the Kandariya Mahadeva temple in Khajuraho. One of the women is caressing another.
* At the Lakshmana temple in Khajuraho (954 CE), a man receives fellatio from a seated male as part of an orgiastic scene.
* At the Rajarani Temple in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, dating from the 10th or 11th century, a sculpture depicts two women engaged in oral sex.
* A 12th-century Shiva temple in Bagali, Karnataka depicts a scene of apparent oral sex between two males on a sculpture below the shikhara.
* At Padhavli near Gwalior, a ruined temple from the 10th century shows a man within an orgiastic group receiving fellatio from another male.
* An 11th-century lifesize sandstone sculpture from Odisha, now in the Seattle Art Museum, shows Kama, the god of love, shooting a flower tipped arrow at two women who are embracing one another.

== Same-sex marriage ==
A Gandharava marriage was the most common form of marriage for lay people described in classical Indian literature and was heavily associated with village life. A Gandharava was a low ranking male deity who had a symbolic association with fine and creative arts, specifically music, with strong connections to sexuality and procreation, and the term is etymologically linked to &quot;fragrance&quot;, and these males are commonly pared with females called &quot;Apsaras&quot; who are associated with the arts, dancing and literature.
&lt;section begin=sodomy/&gt;
There are punishments for homosexual sex listed in numerous texts used within contemporary Hinduism, though these punishments should be taken into context with the likewise numerous punishments listed for heterosexual sex also listed within numerous texts used within contemporary Hinduism. These punishments regardless of whether they are aimed are heterosexuality or homosexuality originally was not aimed at the lay people, but these can also be used as models of general behavior. &lt;section end=sodomy/&gt;There have been reports of Hindu gurus performing same-sex marriages in India since at least the 1980s.

Hinduism is mostly devoid of the &#x27;perfect law&#x27; that can be found in Abrahamic religions (such as the ten commandments) and traditionally Hindus would expect to &quot;rely on reason to decide what is dharma and what is not&quot; &#x27;dharma&#x27;. Combined with the lack of centralization and authority, there is great diversity among Hindus as to how homosexual relationships should be institutionalized in Hindu society.

; Non-binary marriage

A long-running tradition concerning non-binary marriage exists in Hindu society for third genders, which may also add another perspective as to how homosexual relationships should be viewed in the modern age.

The case for the institutionalization of non-binary marriage is strong in Hindu society due to the strong prevalence of evidence dictating how third gendered marriages were conducted since ancient times.

; Institutionalization of unique blessings and rites

&quot;Marriage&quot; comes in several incarnations in Hinduism and several Hindu organizations reject the idea of performing the same ceremonies for both heterosexual and homosexual (and third gendered) couples.

The Australian Council of Hindu Clergy, whose membership includes a significant portion of the Sri Lankan Tamil clergy, lists several types of marriage including those aimed at heterosexual couples and those that are not. It comes to the conclusion that homosexual couples should be provided with their own rites and blessings that are not the same as the rites provided to heterosexual marriage.

; Live-in couples (cohabitation)

A large movement exists concerning the provision of live-in rights to partners who have not married. This would provide a centralized instrument to protect partners while allowing Hindu society to decentralize and provide ceremonies and/or blessings according to what each community thinks is right.

The rights currently provided to live-in couples mostly match that of married couples through criminal law, however, there are limitations on adoption, and wording used implies a heterosexual relationship.

<text>Sergei Vasilyevich Lukyanenko (, ; born 11 April 1968) is a Russian science fiction and fantasy author, writing in Russian. His works often feature intense action-packed plots, interwoven with the moral dilemma of keeping one&#x27;s humanity while being strong. Some of his works have been adapted into film productions, for which he wrote the screenplays.

==Biography==
Lukyanenko was born in Karatau, Kazakhstan, then a part of the Soviet Union. After graduating from school, he moved to Alma-Ata, and enrolled at the Alma-Ata State Medical Institute in 1986 majoring in psychotherapy. He had started writing as a student, and in 1992 had just started making money from it. During this time he became an active member in Russian fandom, visiting conventions and attending seminars all around the Soviet Union. In 1996 he moved to Moscow where he currently resides.

===Name transliteration===
Lukyanenko&#x27;s name is romanized as &quot;Sergey Lukianenko&quot; on the English version of his official website and as &quot;Sergei Lukyanenko&quot; by his publisher on works translated into English. Other spellings such as &quot;Sergey Lukyanenko&quot; are also found.

==Writing career==
===Early years===
Lukyanenko started writing in the mid-1980s, and his first publication, the short story &quot;Misconduct&quot; (&quot;Where The Mean Enemy Lurks&quot;, although written earlier, was published later), followed soon in 1988. 

===After dissolution of the Soviet Union===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the switch to the market economy, Russian authors now had to struggle with unfamiliar realities of a free publishing system.

Lukyanenko, though, fared somewhat better than the others, already having made something of a name in Russian science fiction circles. After moving from Kazakhstan to Moscow, he continued to write there, now often venturing into literary experiments – like the religiously themed alternative history dilogy &quot;Seekers of the Sky&quot;, where he experimented with language stylization.

===Breakthrough===
The novel &quot;Night Watch&quot; marked Lukyanenko&#x27;s return to the fantasy genre.

The 2004 film &quot;Night Watch&quot; (Nochnoy dozor), based on the book, was regarded as &quot;the first Russian blockbuster.&quot; The film grossed over $16 million in Russia, a box office record at that time. In the United States, an adaptation of the film was released by Fox Searchlight. The film &quot;Day Watch&quot; (Dnevnoy dozor) was released in Russia on January 1, 2006, and it was released in the US on June 1, 2007. He also released a number of sequels to the &quot;Watch&quot; series.

==Foreign releases==
Until 2006 relatively few of Lukyanenko&#x27;s works had been released outside of Russia, mostly in Baltic states, Bulgaria and Poland, countries with traditionally strong ties with Russian literature. Even fewer were commercially published in English. However, success of the movies finally changed the situation. &quot;Night Watch&quot;, translated by Andrew Bromfield, was published in English in July 2006, &quot;Day Watch&quot; followed in January 2007, &quot;Twilight Watch&quot; was published in July 2007.

==Literary analysis==
Lukyanenko himself said that his work has been heavily influenced by that of Robert A. Heinlein, the Strugatsky brothers and Vladislav Krapivin, and that he hopes to be remembered as a literary follower of the Strugatsky brothers. Although his books are often set in harsh worlds, Lukyanenko is a humanist writer, and in this sense believes he follows in the footsteps of the Strugatsky brothers. In May 2000, Boris Strugatsky referred to the spirit of the brothers&#x27; books as &quot;that goodness with fists, those tortured attempts by the heroes to remain kind while being strong&quot;, and added &quot;this is the underlying theme for Lukyanenko: how to preserve your goodness in the world of evil when you are strong and well-armed.&quot;

==Position on politics==
Lukyanenko has been known as an avid supporter of copyright, i. e. harsh measures against copyright infringement, traditionally widespread among Russian readership. During the large meeting of various authors and business people titled &quot;Copyright defense on internet&quot; in 2013 he complained that &quot;only 1% of all downloads of his latest book were legal downloads&quot;.

Lukyanenko kept a blog at LiveJournal, posting both personal and public information or snippets of a book in progress. On his website and his blog, Lukyanenko has repeatedly spoken out against the international adoption of Russian orphans, especially by Americans. His first blog was discontinued on 11 July 2008 after a conflict with readers over the issue. He started another blog a few days later, promising firmer moderation policies. Lukyanenko welcomed the Dima Yakovlev Law banning the international adoption of children from Russia in response to the US Magnitsky Act. 

Lukyanenko condemned the Euromaidan movement of 2013-14, saying that it would be followed by a forced Ukrainization, which is &quot;as much of a crime as a forced sex change&quot;. Lukyanenko, having Ukrainian ancestry himself, threatened authors supporting the Euromaidan that he would make every effort to prevent their books being published in Russia. He also forbade translation of his books into the Ukrainian language. He welcomed the March 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.

In February 2014 Lukyanenko announced boycott of Denmark because of the culling of a giraffe at the Copenhagen Zoo.

On 28 February 2022, Lukyanenko was the leading signatory of a public letter with a few other authors supporting Russian military invasion of Ukraine launched four days earlier. The letter makes allegations of NATO&#x27;s &quot;secret plans to destroy Russia&quot;, Western countries&#x27; &quot;embracement of Nazis&quot;, calls the 2014 Crimean status referendum legitimate and &quot;free&quot;, and claims Russia&#x27;s invasion aimed at &quot;bringing peace in Europe&quot;.

On 3 September 2022, at Chicon 8, the World Science Fiction Society passed a resolution condemning Lukyanenko&#x27;s pro-invasion views and asking that he be disinvited as Guest of Honor at the 2023 Worldcon in Chengdu.

In late October 2022, Lukyanenko appeared as a guest on the RT show of Anton Krasovsky when Krasovsky mocked rapes of Ukrainian civilians by Russian soldiers and called for Ukrainian children to be drowned or burned alive and the rest of the country shot. &quot;Whoever says that Moscow occupied them, you drown them in a river with a strong undercurrent [...] shove them into huts and burn them up.&quot; When asked how Russia could annex Ukraine when this would mean incorporating many people who did not wish to live under Russian rule, Krasovsky suggested: &quot;So we shoot them.&quot; After the show, Lukyankeno released a statement condemning Krasovsky&#x27;s statement.

<text>Beatrice Roini Liua Faumuina (born 23 October 1974 in Auckland, New Zealand) is a former New Zealand discus thrower.

==Career==
Faumuina was a gold medallist at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics. She has represented New Zealand in four Summer Olympics. After winning the discus event at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester she was featured on a stamp from Samoa. She is currently New Zealand&#x27;s Trade Commissioner and Consul General, New York.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics she placed 7th in the discus with a throw of 64.45 metres. Early in her career, she was coached by Les Mills, discus gold medallist at the 1966 Commonwealth Games.

In the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Faumuina was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to athletics. On 16 October 2005, she was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

In 2006, she appeared in the New Zealand version of the television series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; where she was placed second. Since 2006 she has been a presenter on the Television New Zealand Pacific Islands current events programme Tagata Pasifika. She also attended Lynfield College.

In 2007, Beatrice decided to focus on athletics and based herself in Australia for the majority of the year before competing in Osaka, Japan. She returned to good form after a disappointing injury plagued her 2006 season, placing her 4th at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games. She threw 62.2 metres at a meet in Christchurch, beating rival Dani Samuels from Australia. This followed a winning throw of 62.08 throw at a meet in Canberra.

She placed 28th in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing with a throw of 57.18m, failing to qualify for the final. Her comments to media following her elimination were widely criticised after it was perceived that she was satisfied with what many viewed as a sub-standard performance.

Faumuina finished seventh in the 2009 Reebok Grand Prix in New York, with a throw of 56.73 metres. She was expected to compete in the Prefontaine Classic meet in Oregon, in order to throw the qualifying standard for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin. However, she did not attend the meeting and her coach stated that she had decided to focus on her upcoming Bachelor of Business Studies exams instead.

Faumuina has retired from discus throwing.

<text>Red Storm Entertainment, Inc. is an American video game developer and studio of Ubisoft based in Cary, North Carolina. Founded in November 1996 between author Tom Clancy, manager Doug Littlejohns, and software development company Virtus Corporation, Red Storm develops games in the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s&quot; franchise. Ubisoft (then known as Ubi Soft) acquired the studio in August 2000.

== History ==
Prior to founding Red Storm Entertainment, Tom Clancy, an American novelist, had developed &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s SSN&quot;, a video game based on his book &quot;SSN&quot;. The game was created over six years in cooperation with Virtus Corporation, a 3D animation tool development company based in Cary, North Carolina, and its game development division, Virtus Studios. &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s SSN&quot; was released on November 12, 1996, and on the following day, Clancy and Virtus Corporation announced the formation of Red Storm Entertainment. The name was derived from that of Clancy&#x27;s book &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;. The new company absorbed Virtus Studios, making for an initial staff count of nineteen. Red Storm moved into offices within Cary, with Clancy assuming the role of chairman, while Doug Littlejohns (a retired commodore in the Royal Navy who had previously acted as a technical consultant on &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s SSN&quot;) became Red Storm&#x27;s president and chief executive officer. The company expanded from nineteen to thirty-two people by March 1, 1997, in the wake of which it moved to new offices on Aerial Center (close to the Raleigh–Durham International Airport) in Morrisville.

The company released its first game – &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Politika&quot;, the first in the &quot;Power Plays&quot; series – in 1997. Red Storm quickly gained a reputation with games like &quot;Dominant Species&quot;, one of the first 3D real-time strategy games. However, it was with &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; (1998) that the company firmly established itself commercially. In contrast to the run-and-gun first-person shooters (FPS) that had gone before, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was the first true tactical FPS, a game that rewarded patience and planning as well as good aim and a keen eye. Developed alongside the novel of the same name, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; introduced terms like &quot;one shot, one kill&quot; and &quot;tango down&quot; into the gamer lexicon. Its ground-breaking multiplayer action, including a new form of cooperative gameplay, set the standard for tactical multiplayer.

Red Storm followed on the success of &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; with a mission pack, &quot;Eagle Watch&quot;, and then in 2000 with a sequel, &quot;Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear&quot;. The company also expanded into turn-based strategy (&quot;ruthless.com&quot; and &quot;Shadow Watch&quot;) and military real-time strategy game (&quot;Force 21&quot;). In August 2000, Ubisoft purchased the studio. At the time of the sale, Red Storm was already producing &quot;Ghost Recon&quot;.

Released in 2001, &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; won multiple &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards. The Xbox version also marked the first time Red Storm Entertainment ventured into in-house console development and was the first Xbox Live title to take advantage of the possibilities of console multiplayer. Follow-up add-ons like &quot;Island Thunder&quot; continued to expand the world of the Ghosts, while Red Storm itself grew and moved offices to a new location in Morrisville, North Carolina. By 2003, Ubisoft was ready to consolidate its North Carolina operations. Ubisoft&#x27;s other area studio, Sinister Games in downtown Raleigh, was integrated into Red Storm, with the central base of operations remaining at the Morrisville location.

In 2004, Red Storm released &quot;Ghost Recon 2&quot;, the follow-up to the original game, designed by now lead designer Christian Allen. Released on Xbox, it signaled the company&#x27;s transition to primarily console development. It produced an add-on, &quot;Summit Strike&quot;, in 2005, as well as downloadable content. Red Storm has also developed the multiplayer aspects of both iterations of the &quot;Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter&quot; series. It won the BAFTA&#x27;s Game of the Year and Best Technical Achievement awards in 2006.

In December 2008, Red Storm acquired the lease for the CentreGreen One building in Cary, which had previously been occupied by Qualcomm until earlier that year. Red Storm subsequently moved to CentreGreen One in May 2009, relocating from its previous offices on Gateway Centre in Morrisville.

Red Storm continued development on Tom Clancy games such as &quot;Ghost Recon: Future Soldier&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Division&quot; (2016), while co-operating with Ubisoft Montreal on the &quot;Far Cry&quot; franchise.

In 2016, Red Storm released their first virtual reality game, &quot;Werewolves Within&quot;, followed by a May 2017 release of another, &quot;Star Trek: Bridge Crew&quot;.

In May 2018, Red Storm acquired the Weston Office Campus (located on Weston Parkway in Cary), which it planned to move to after renovations and co-occupy with Ubisoft&#x27;s NCSA Customer Relationship Center. 

In May 2021, it was announced that Red Storm was working on a free-to-play spinoff of &quot;The Division&quot;, called &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division: Heartland.&quot; However, after multiple delays and public play testing, Ubisoft cancelled the game in May 2024. Ubisoft subsequently laid off 45 employees between the company&#x27;s San Francisco and Cary offices in August.

<text>Kim Hee-sun (; born June 11, 1977) is a South Korean actress. She rose to fame in the 1990s with leading roles in television series such as &quot;Men of the Bath House&quot; (1995), &quot;Propose&quot; (1997), &quot;Wedding Dress&quot; (1997), &quot;Forever Yours&quot; (1998), &quot;Mister Q&quot; (1998), &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1998), and &quot;Tomato&quot; (1999). Kim also starred in the martial arts films &quot;Bichunmoo&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Myth&quot; (2005), historical medical series &quot;Faith&quot; (2012), teen series &quot;Angry Mom&quot; (2015), melodrama &quot;The Lady in Dignity&quot; (2017), and fantasy series &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (2022).

==Career==
Kim Hee-sun won the Fair Face Beauty Contest in 1992 when she was a middle school student, and began modeling in teen magazines. In 1993, Kim, then a high school sophomore, appeared in a commercial for &quot;Lotte Samkang&quot;&#x27;s crab chips, which led to her acting debut in &quot;Dinosaur Teacher&quot;; and an MC gig for music show &quot;Live TV Music 20&quot; that same year.

She enjoyed peak popularity in the mid-to-late 1990s, starring in one hit Korean drama after another. These include &quot;Men of the Bath House&quot; (1995) written by Kim Soo-hyun, &quot;Propose&quot; (1997), &quot;Wedding Dress&quot; (1997) with Lee Seung-yeon, &quot;Forever Yours&quot; (1998) with Ryu Si-won, &quot;Mister Q&quot; (1998) with Kim Min-jong and Song Yun-ah, &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1998) with Ahn Jae-wook, and &quot;Tomato&quot; (1999) with Kim Suk-hoon. Kim won the top prize at the 1998 SBS Drama Awards for &quot;Mister Q&quot;, making her, at the time, the youngest ever Grand Prize (Daesang) winner, at 21 years old. During this period, she also appeared in numerous advertisements and rose to fame both at home and abroad as one of Korea&#x27;s most beautiful and trend-setting actresses.

Unlike her success in television, the big screen proved to be a bigger challenge for Kim&#x27;s career. She made her film debut in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Repechage&quot; opposite Jang Dong-gun, and the film&#x27;s director Lee Kwang-hoon subsequently put her in his next film &quot;Ghost in Love&quot; (1999). In her most high-profile role to date, Kim played the daughter of a Mongolian general in the big-budget martial arts fantasy &quot;Bichunmoo&quot;, shot in China and released in the summer of 2000. Although criticized for her acting in the film, it gave her more local and international exposure than any of her other films. Along with her popular TV dramas, it cemented her position as a Korean Wave star in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and throughout Southeast Asia.

In late 2001, Kim took on a completely different kind of role, cutting her hair short and starring as an animator in &quot;Wanee &amp; Junah&quot;. Although her acting in this film drew a favorable response from critics, the film itself was a commercial flop. Her career took a downturn in 2003, when the environmentally-themed melodrama &quot;A Man Who Went to Mars&quot;, also known as &quot;A Letter From Mars&quot;, costarring Shin Ha-kyun became an utter bomb at the box office. She returned to television, however &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (2003) which was adapted from the Japanese television drama &quot;Yamato Nadeshiko&quot;, and &quot;Sad Love Story&quot; (2005) where she played a blind singer, both received low ratings.

Due to her popularity among Chinese viewers, Kim was then cast opposite Jackie Chan in &quot;The Myth&quot;, for which she learned to speak Mandarin. Back in Korea, her career slump continued with &quot;Smile Again&quot; in 2006.

Kim married in 2007, and she left the entertainment scene to devote her time to being a wife and mother. During this five-year hiatus from acting, apart from appearing in magazines, Kim published a book in 2009 on childcare and how to lose post-pregnancy weight, titled &quot;Kim Hee-sun&#x27;s Happy Mom Project&quot;.

Though she had a minor role in the Chinese epic &quot;The Warring States&quot; (2011), Kim officially made her comeback in 2012 as a modern-day doctor who time-travels to Goryeo in the period romance &quot;Faith&quot;, the last collaboration by screenwriter Song Ji-na and television director Kim Jong-hak.

In 2013, Kim became one of the hosts of the revamped second season of variety talk show &quot;Strong Heart&quot;, titled &quot;Hwasin – Controller of the Heart&quot;. After &quot;Hwasin&quot; was cancelled, she was cast in the Lee Kyung-hee-penned weekend family drama &quot;Wonderful Days&quot; (2014). This was followed by &quot;Angry Mom&quot; in 2015, where Kim&#x27;s portrayal of the titular character who returns to high school when she learns that her teenage daughter is being bullied was highly praised by critics. Kim then began filming for Chinese fantasy television drama &quot;Ice Fantasy&quot;, which started airing in July 2016.

In 2017, Kim starred in the television series, &quot;The Lady in Dignity&quot; alongside Kim Sun-ah. The series achieved a rating of 12.6% for its finale, becoming JTBC&#x27;s highest rated drama at the time. Kim&#x27;s performance was well received by critics and audience.

In 2018, Kim starred in tvN&#x27;s mystery drama &quot;Room No. 9&quot;. The same year she confirmed her return to the big screen with independent film &quot;Paper Flower&quot;. In 2020, Kim starred in the science fiction romance drama &quot;Alice&quot; which was broadcast on SBS in 2020 and released worldwide on Netflix in 2021.

In 2022, Kim starred in the MBC fantasy drama &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, playing the role of grim reaper Goo-ryeon.

==Personal life==
Kim wed businessman Park Ju-young in a lavish ceremony at the Seoul Sheraton Grande Walkerhill Hotel on October 19, 2007. She gave birth to daughter Park Yeon-ah on January 21, 2009.
=== Philanthropy ===
On March 9, 2022, Kim donated million to the Korean Red Cross To help the victims of the massive forest fire that started in Uljin, Gyeongbuk and has spread to Samcheok, Gangwon. On April 25, 2022, Kim donated million to Asan Medical Center to be used to pay for the treatments of low-income patients.

<text>Ko Mak (, ) is a small island of Trat province, Thailand. It is a subdistrict (&quot;tambon&quot;) of Ko Kut district. The island is named after the areca nut (หมาก), also known as the &quot;betel nut&quot;.

==History==
The first settler on the island was Chao Sua Seng, a Chinese Affairs Officer during the reign of King Rama V, who established a coconut plantation. He sold the plantation to Luang Prompakdii, also a Chinese Affairs Officer whose descendants still own the land to this day. Luang Prompakdii and his children are known to have established more coconut and rubber plantations, effectively covering most of the arable land in these two sought-after exports.
The first attempt at attracting a tourism market was in 1974, when bungalows were built at Ban Ao Nid on the east of the island. Infrastructure, specifically transport and telecommunications were in their early stages and as a result, the tourism industry on Ko Mak took some time to become established. By 1987 certain beaches and land were cleared and the first resorts were built.

Originally the area of the Ko Kut district was part of the subdistrict (&quot;tambon&quot;) Ko Chang, Laem Ngop District. In 1952 the subdistrict Ko Mak was established covering the whole island, at that time divided into four villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). In 1980, three villages of Ko Mak were split off to create the subdistrict Ko Kut. On 1 April 1990 the government upgraded &quot;tambon&quot; Ko Kut together with &quot;tambon&quot; Ko Mak to a minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;).

On 15 May 2007, all of Thailand&#x27;s 81 minor districts were upgraded to full districts. On 24 August the upgrade became official.

As local government entities, two tambon administrative organizations (TAO) were created in 2003 and 2004 respectively. The Tambon Council Ko Kut was upgraded to a TAO in 2003, and for Ko Mak in 2004.

==Geography==
The island of Ko Mak is in the east of the Gulf of Thailand, 35 kilometers from the mainland, and is the third largest island in Trat Province, after Ko Chang and Ko Kut. With an area of 16 square kilometers, Ko Mak has 27 km of coastline, many long sandy beaches, and a few hills. The island is home to approximately 400 locals and renowned for its beautiful beaches, having been included in the UK&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; 10 most beautiful beaches list in 2006. Ko Mak has a temple, a primary school, three fishing villages, a market, and a health center.

It is possible to walk to Ko Kham, a smaller island less than 1 km northwest of Ko Mak during low tide.

==Tourism==
The island is small and flat with coconut plantations and mangrove vegetation along the coastline. There are approximately 15 small scale resorts on Ko Mak. Both Ko Kham and Ko Phi can easily be reached with sea kayak or boat rental from the resorts on the northwest coast and are snorkeling destinations.

Ko Mak has no pubs, bars with noisy music at night, or liquor stores. The campaign of use less plastic is promoted and plastic can be recycled. Locals encourage tourists to collect trash from the beach every Saturday as part of Ko Mak&#x27;s Trash Hero activities.

The descendants of the five original families of Ko Mak still live on the island. The occupations of those ancestors was collecting &quot;mak ling&quot; (&quot;Areca triandra&quot;), and cultivating coconut and rubber plantations.

His Mayoral term commenced with a by-election in 1990 after the resignation of Dame Catherine Tizard, who had been appointed Governor-General. The new council had been formed following local body amalgamation in 1989 which saw many of the district borough councils merged into one larger city. Mills&#x27; first term oversaw the merger of these many district boroughs into one city. The Aotea Centre was also opened at the beginning of his term. Other initiatives which commenced on Mills&#x27; watch as Mayor included the introduction of the green &quot;wheelie bins&quot;, metered user charges for water use, council assets like golf courses were leased to private management, and the city also quit some assets that no longer were of priority, like its abattoir.

Other major events during Mills&#x27; tenure included work commencing on the America&#x27;s Cup Village at the Auckland viaduct, the commencement and opening of the Sky Tower and Casino complex that now dominates the Auckland skyline, the redevelopment of the Civic theatre, and refurbishment of the Auckland Town Hall.

During this period, the 1998 Auckland power crisis occurred, which shut down most of the inner city. Mills&#x27; Britomart Transport Centre plans also came under some criticism as being too focused on property development and not enough on transport. His successor Christine Fletcher led plans for a scaled down Britomart Station without the large property development plans.

Mills was defeated in a three-way contest against businessman Richard Holden and eventual winner Christine Fletcher in 1998. Mills himself was absent for most of the election campaign, leading the New Zealand team at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and mentoring the gold medal-winning discus thrower Beatrice Faumuina.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1973 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Mills was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to sport. In the 2002 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, he was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to local government and sport.

In 2022, Mills and his son Phillip and daughter-in-law Jackie Mills were jointly inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

<doc id="939284" wikidata="Q5648292" url="?curid=939284" title="Hank Borowy">
<text>Henry Ludwig Borowy (May 12, 1916 – August 23, 2004) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1942 through 1951 for the New York Yankees (1942–45), Chicago Cubs (1945–48), Philadelphia Phillies (1949–50), Pittsburgh Pirates (1950), and Detroit Tigers (1950–51). He batted and threw right-handed.

Born in Bloomfield, New Jersey, Borowy graduated from Bloomfield High School and Fordham University. Over the course of his career, Borowy pitched in six World Series games, and posted a 108–82 regular season record, with 690 strikeouts, and a 3.50 earned run average (ERA), in 1,717 innings.

==Major league career==
Borowy debuted on April 18, 1942, with the Yankees, finishing with a 15–4 record, 85 strikeouts, and a 2.82 ERA. He started Game 4 of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals but did not receive a decision.

In 1943, Borowy went 14–9, with 107 strikeouts, and a 2.82 ERA, while being credited with the win in Game 3 of the World Series against the Cardinals. Named an All-Star in 1944, he pitched three scoreless innings in the game, ending the season with a 17–12 record, 107 strikeouts, and a 2.64 ERA.

In 1945, Borowy posted a 10–5 record with the Yankees in the first half of the season. The 1945 All Star game was cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions, but Borowy was selected a &quot;virtual&quot; All Star in an unofficial poll of managers conducted by the Associated Press. At the All-Star break he was placed on waivers by the Yankees, and eventually sold to the Cubs for $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Borowy went 11–2 for the remainder of the season, including three wins over the Cardinals down the stretch, and led the National League (NL) in winning percentage (.846) and ERA (2.14), as the Cubs won the pennant. His combined 1945 Yankees/Cubs record was 21–7, with 82 strikeouts, and a 2.65 ERA. Borowy is one of two pitchers in major league history to win at least 10 games for two different teams in the same season (the other is Bartolo Colón, with the Cleveland Indians and Montreal Expos, in 2002).

On October 3, 1945, the Detroit Tigers and Cubs met in the World Series for the fourth time. In the opener Borowy pitched a six-hit, 9–0 shutout. He lost the fifth game, and then came back to win the sixth with four scoreless relief innings. Borowy started the final game on one day&#x27;s rest but gave up hits to the first three batters before leaving. He took the loss and the Tigers won the Series. Before the 2016 World Series, Borowy was the last Chicago Cubs pitcher to win a World Series game.

Borowy is the fourth and last pitcher to hit two doubles in the same inning, on May 5, 1946 (the previous three were Fred Goldsmith, Joe Wood, and Ted Lyons).

For the remainder of Borowy&#x27;s career, he was plagued by finger blisters and a chronic sore shoulder. Just prior to Borowy&#x27;s retirement, he delivered one of the worst pitching performances ever seen in big league baseball. Playing against the St. Louis Browns on August 18, Borowy was called upon to pitch in the bottom of the seventh inning, with the game tied at 9-all. Borowy faced nine batters, and was unable to record an out, giving up four singles, four walks, and a three-run home run, before being pulled from the game by Tigers manager Red Rolfe. No other pitcher has faced nine batters in a game and not managed an out. He pitched his final game on September 14, 1951.

==Death==
Borowy was a longtime resident of Brick Township, New Jersey, where he died on August 23, 2004, aged 88.

<doc id="939291" wikidata="Q175641" url="?curid=939291" title="Tortilla chip">
<text>A tortilla chip is a snack food made from corn tortilla, which are cut into triangles and then fried or baked (alternatively they may be discs pressed out of corn masa then fried or baked). Corn tortillas are made of nixtamalized corn, vegetable oil, salt and water. Although first mass-produced commercially in the U.S. in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, tortilla chips grew out of Mexican cuisine, where similar items were well known, such as totopos and tostadas.

Though usually made of yellow corn, they can also be made of white, blue, or red corn. Tortilla chips intended to be dipped are typically only lightly salted, while others may be seasoned with a variety of flavors. Tortilla chips may be served as a garnish for soups or dishes such as chili con carne.

==History==
Ignacio Anaya used triangles of fried tortilla for the nachos he created in 1943.

The triangle-shaped tortilla chip was popularized by Rebecca Webb Carranza in the 1940s as a way to make use of misshapen tortillas rejected from the automated tortilla manufacturing machine that she and her husband used at their Mexican delicatessen and tortilla factory in southwest Los Angeles. Carranza found that the discarded tortillas, cut into triangles and fried, were a popular snack, and she sold them for a dime a bag at the El Zarape Tortilla Factory. In 1994, Carranza received the Golden Tortilla award for her contribution to the Mexican food industry.

==Tex-Mex and Mexican cuisine==
Tortilla chips are a popular appetizer in Tex-Mex and Mexican restaurants in the U.S. and elsewhere. Their popularity outside of California saw a steady rise in the late 1970s when they began to compete with corn chips, the dipping chip of choice during the first three quarters of the 20th century. Tortilla chips are typically served with a dip, such as salsa, chile con queso, or guacamole. When not served with a dip, the chips are often seasoned with herbs and spices. Although they are now available worldwide, the United States is one of the main markets for tortilla chips. Commercial brand names for tortilla chips include Tostitos, Doritos, Phileas Fogg snacks, and Don Tacos (in Japan).

A more elaborate dish utilizing tortilla chips is nachos. First created in 1943, nachos were invented in Mexico. &quot;They originated in the small Mexican town of Piedras Negras in 1943 and were invented by restaurateur Ignacio &#x27;Nacho&#x27; Anaya.&quot; Nachos are tortilla chips served with melted or shredded cheese, although often other toppings are added or substituted, such as meat, salsa (such as pico de gallo), refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, diced onions, olives, and pickled jalapeños. More elaborate nachos are often baked for a short period of time to warm the tortillas and melt shredded cheese.

==Corn chips==
A similar fried corn snack is the corn chip, which is not made from a tortilla, but from corn meal which has been processed into a particular shape, typically a small scoop. Fritos are an example of this. The principal difference between the corn in tortilla and corn chips is that the corn in a tortilla chip has undergone a process known as nixtamalization, which involves processing the raw corn with quicklime.

<text>Larviform female is a biological phenomenon occurring in some insect species, where the females in the adult stage of metamorphosis resemble the larvae to various degrees, while the male appears more morphologically adult (as imagoes). The resemblance may mean the larviform female has the same coloring as the larvae and/or similar body plans, and may be the result of the female arresting development at earlier stages of ecdysis than males. The female may not pupate at all, as in &quot;Xenos vesparum&quot;. Typically, the female is wingless and generally larger than the male. Larviform females still reach sexual maturity. Larviform females occur in several insect groups, including most Strepsiptera and Bagworm moths, many elateroid beetles (e.g., Lampyridae), and some gall midges.

Larviform females are an area of interest in the study of the evolution of insect metamorphosis.

Since these females have lower ability to disperse, this may help explain high endemism in some groups, such as Lampyridae fireflies.

<doc id="939312" wikidata="Q5602145" url="?curid=939312" title="Greely, Ontario">
<text>Greely is a suburban-rural community in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Located south of the city in Osgoode Ward, it was part of the Township of Osgoode prior to amalgamation in 2001. Greely is currently the largest rural village in terms of land area and the third largest in terms of population in the City of Ottawa. According to the Greely Community Association, it is bounded on the east by Sale Barn Road and Greyscreek Road, on the north by Mitch Owens on the west by Manotick Station Road, and on the south by Snake Island Road. According to the Canada 2011 Census, the population within these boundaries was 9,049.

Greely falls within the borders of the federal parliamentary riding of Carleton. Provincially, it falls within the riding of Carleton, which shares the same boundaries of its federal counterpart, and is represented on City Council by George Darouze, being in Osgoode Ward.

Greely is home to a set of tight-knit and unique communities throughout the village. Most homes sit on -acre to lots. Some developers offer condominium-like amenities such as pools, tennis courts, man-made lakes, beaches, and small neighbourhood community centres within their residential communities. The Greely Community Centre hosts meetings and activities for the entire rural town. Every year, they organize a Winter Carnival and a renowned Canada Day celebration.

Between 2000 and 2008, Greely has seen a 58.7% increase in the number of dwellings. Greely&#x27;s increasingly rapid growth can be attributed to its rural atmosphere and easy access to Ottawa&#x27;s urban centre. Furthermore, Greely presently has several large areas of undeveloped land within its boundaries. Greely&#x27;s boundaries currently contain enough land for approximately twenty-two years of residential growth based on current development patterns.

Greely has a strong commercial district housing many small and medium manufacturing and services companies. It has a few businesses to provide the community with essentials, including 2 gas stations, 3 pizzerias, an A &amp; W and a couple of restaurants. In the summer, it hosts an outdoor weekly market featuring local makers, a coffee shop and a used book store. A new commercial development at Parkway Road and Bank Street houses a 24-hour grocery store with liquor/beer store, a dollar store and more businesses under development.

==Churches==
*All Saints Anglican Church
*Parkway Road Pentecostal Church
*Our Lady of the Visitation (Not actually in Greely, but on the border. Many Greely residents attend this church, and they hold events in Greely.)

==Schools==
*Castor Valley Elementary School
*Greely Elementary School
*St. Mary Elementary School (Not actually in Greely, but on the border. Many Greely children attend this school.)

==Library==
The Greely branch of the Ottawa Public Library was opened in 1976, after receiving approval from Osgoode Township Council, with the local fire department agreeing to let them use their meeting room for the branch. During the 1990s, the Osgoode Township Library Board received a grant from the Ontario government to build a new branch, but the building never came to fruition. In 2009, the community secured funding for a brand new library to be built as an extension to the Greely Community Centre at 1448 Meadow Drive. The new facility opened its doors on March 14, 2011.

==Notable residents==

* Pierre Poilievre (born 1979), member of Parliament, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and the leader of the Official Opposition

<doc id="939317" wikidata="Q12061166" url="?curid=939317" title="The Life of Riley">
<text>The Life of Riley is an American radio situation comedy series of the 1940s that was adapted into a 1949 feature film, as well as two different television series, and a comic book.

==Radio series==

The radio program initially aired on the Blue Network (later known as ABC) from January 16, 1944, to July 8, 1945, it then moved to NBC, where it was broadcast from September 8, 1945, to June 29, 1951.

Irving Brecher pitched the radio series for friend Groucho Marx under the title &quot;The Flotsam Family&quot;, but the sponsor balked at what would have been essentially a straight head-of-household role for Marx. (Marx would get his own series &quot;Blue Ribbon Town&quot; instead.) Brecher then saw William Bendix as taxicab company owner Tim McGuerin in Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;The McGuerins from Brooklyn&quot; (1942). Radio historian Gerald Nachman quotes Brecher as stating, &quot;He was a Brooklyn guy and there was something about him. I thought, this guy could play it. He&#x27;d made a few films, like &quot;Lifeboat&quot;, but he was not a name. So I took &quot;The Flotsam Family&quot; script, revised it, made it a Brooklyn family, took out the flippancies and made it more meat-and-potatoes, and thought of a new title, &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;. Bendix&#x27;s delivery and the spin he put on his lines made it work.&quot;

The reworked script cast Bendix in the title role of blundering Chester A. Riley, a wing riveter at the fictional Cunningham Aircraft plant in California. His frequent exclamation of indignation—&quot;What a revoltin&#x27; development &quot;this&quot; is!&quot;—became one of the most famous catchphrases of the 1940s. It was later reused by Benjamin J. Grimm of the Fantastic Four. The radio series also benefited from the immense popularity of a supporting character, Digby &quot;Digger&quot; O&#x27;Dell (John Brown), &quot;the friendly undertaker.&quot; Brecher told Brown, &quot;I want a very sepulchral voice, quavering, morbid,&quot; and he got it right away.

The supporting cast featured Paula Winslowe as Riley&#x27;s wife, Peg, and as Riley&#x27;s mother-in law; Brown as O&#x27;Dell and as Riley&#x27;s co-worker Jim Gillis; Francis &quot;Dink&quot; Trout as Waldo Binney; Tommy Cook, Bobby Ellis and Scotty Beckett as Junior at various times during the show&#x27;s run; Barbara Eiler as Riley&#x27;s daughter, Babs; Shirley Mitchell as Honeybee Gillis; Hans Conried as Uncle Baxter; and Alan Reed as multiple characters, including Riley&#x27;s boss (Mr. Stevenson) and Peg&#x27;s father. Henry Morgan voiced Riley&#x27;s father in one episode. Mel Blanc provided some voices as well, including that of Junior&#x27;s dog Tiger as well as that of a dog catcher who claimed to have a special bond with dogs.

Gillis often gave Riley bad information that got him into trouble, whereas Digger gave him good information that &quot;helped him out of a hole,&quot; as he might have put it. Brown&#x27;s lines as the undertaker were often repetitive, including puns based on his profession; but thanks to Brown&#x27;s delivery, the audience loved him. The program was broadcast live with a studio audience, most of whom were not aware Brown played both characters. As a result, when Digger delivered his first line, it was usually greeted with howls of laughter and applause from surprised audience members.

The series was co-developed by the nonperforming Marx Brother turned agent Gummo. The American Meat Institute (1944–45), Procter &amp; Gamble (Teel dentifrice and Prell shampoo) (1945–49), and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer (1949–51) took turns as the radio program&#x27;s sponsor.

An unrelated radio show with the title &quot;Life of Riley&quot; was a summer replacement show heard on CBS from April 12, 1941, to September 6, 1941. The CBS program starred Lionel Stander as J. Riley Farnsworth and had no real connection with the more famous series that followed a few years later.

==The Life of Riley: Film==

William Bendix also starred in the 1949 film version of &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; directed by Irving Brecher. It earned $1.6 million in the U.S. and Canada, preventing him from starring in the TV series that began in the same year.

==Television==

In 1948, NBC broadcast &quot;two live television test programs based on the radio series.&quot; The April 13 episode starred Herb Vigran as Riley, and the April 20 episode had Buddy Gray in the title role.
A third episode was also produced the same year with Lon Chaney Jr. as Riley and DeCamp as Peg, but not aired. It is available on various public domain DVD releases.

==Television series==

The NBC television adaptation, also created by Irving Brecher, was a single-season 
series from October 4, 1949, to March 28, 1950. Originally, William Bendix was to have appeared on both radio and TV, but Bendix&#x27;s RKO Radio Pictures movie contract prevented him from appearing on the TV version.

Jackie Gleason starred, with Rosemary DeCamp replacing Paula Winslowe as wife Peg, Gloria Winters as daughter Barbara (Babs), Lanny Rees as son Chester Jr. (Junior), and Sid Tomack as Jim Gillis, Riley&#x27;s manipulative best buddy and next-door neighbor. John Brown returned as the morbid, counseling undertaker Digby (Digger) O&#x27;Dell. In the 1955–1956 season, the Riley family moved and were given new neighbors portrayed by Florence Sundstrom and George O&#x27;Hanlon.

It was during this period that Gleason played Riley on one episode of the radio series. At the beginning of the November 11, 1949 radio episode the announcer explained that William Bendix had strained his voice while performing the role of an umpire for an upcoming film (&quot;Kill the Umpire&quot;) and Gleason substituted for him that one night.

==Award==
&quot;Life of Riley&quot; won the first Emmy Award (for &quot;Best Film Made For and Shown on Television&quot;) with Groucho Marx receiving a credit for the story. However, it came to an end after 26 episodes because Irving Brecher and sponsor Pabst Brewing Company reached an impasse on extending the series for a full 39-week season.

=== Episodes ===
==Television series reboot==
The second TV series ran for six seasons, from January 2, 1953, to May 23, 1958. It was produced by Tom McKnight for NBC and featured William Bendix. He was supported by Marjorie Reynolds, replacing both Paula Winslowe and Rosemary DeCamp, as wife Peg; Tom D&#x27;Andrea as schemer buddy Jim Gillis; Gloria Blondell (sister of Joan Blondell) as Gillis&#x27; wife, Honeybee, and Gregory Marshall as their son Egbert; Lugene Sanders was Babs and Wesley Morgan was Junior. The character of Digger O&#x27;Dell was not resurrected as a result of actor John Brown having been placed on the Hollywood blacklist. Sterling Holloway recurred as neighbor Waldo Binney, another radio character.

Nevertheless, this &quot;Life of Riley&quot; series with Bendix was a ratings hit, ranking at No. 16 in its first season, with four of its six seasons in the top 30, and ran for a total of 217 episodes. It then went into syndicated reruns. The latter portion of the fifth season, broadcast between April and June 1957, was filmed and originally broadcast in color, although only black-and-white film prints of those episodes were syndicated. For the final season, filming reverted to black-and-white. Sponsors of the TV show included Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer (1949–50), Gulf Oil (1953–58) and Lever Brothers (1957–58).

In all of the show&#x27;s incarnations, the comedic plotlines centered around Riley himself, a gullible and occasionally clumsy (but big-hearted) man, and the doings and undoings of his family. Riley&#x27;s penchant for turning mere trouble into near-disaster through his well-intentioned bumbling was often aided or instigated by his arch best friend/next-door neighbor, Gillis.

Bendix and Rosemary DeCamp reprised the roles in an hour-long radio adaptation of the feature film that was presented on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on May 8, 1950.

==Comic book==
A comic book adaptation of the show was produced by Dell Comics in 1958 as part of their &quot;Four Color&quot; series of one-shots.

<text>In predicate logic, generalization (also universal generalization, universal introduction, GEN, UG) is a valid inference rule. It states that if formula_1 has been derived, then formula_2 can be derived.

==Generalization with hypotheses==
The full generalization rule allows for hypotheses to the left of the turnstile, but with restrictions. Assume formula_3 is a set of formulas, formula_4 a formula, and formula_5 has been derived. The generalization rule states that formula_6 can be derived if formula_7 is not mentioned in formula_3 and formula_9 does not occur in formula_4. 

These restrictions are necessary for soundness. Without the first restriction, one could conclude formula_11 from the hypothesis formula_12. Without the second restriction, one could make the following deduction:
#formula_13 (Hypothesis)
#formula_14 (Existential instantiation)
#formula_15 (Existential instantiation)
#formula_16 (Faulty universal generalization)

This purports to show that formula_17 which is an unsound deduction. Note that formula_18 is permissible if formula_7 is not mentioned in formula_3 (the second restriction need not apply, as the semantic structure of formula_21 is not being changed by the substitution of any variables).

==Example of a proof==
Prove: formula_22 is derivable from formula_23 and formula_24.

Proof:
In this proof, universal generalization was used in step 8. The deduction theorem was applicable in steps 10 and 11 because the formulas being moved have no free variables.

<doc id="939346" wikidata="Q696318" url="?curid=939346" title="Midori Days">
<text>is a Japanese manga series by Kazurou Inoue. It was published by Shogakukan in the magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from September 2002 to July 2004, with its chapters collected in eight volumes. The manga was licensed in North America by Viz Media. The series follows Seiji Sawamura, who one day finds his right hand replaced with a girl named Midori Kasugano and his attempts to return her to her real body.

The series was adapted as a 13-episode anime television series produced by Pierrot, broadcast from April to June 2004. The anime series was licensed in North America by Media Blasters.

==Plot==
Seiji Sawamura is the toughest student in his high school. His grades are not very good because he fights more than he studies, but he tends to protect the weaker students from bullies. A few classmates idolize him; one (Midori Kasugano from a different school) shyly loves him from afar; but everybody else is just afraid of him, which has made it impossible for him to find a girlfriend. In desperation, he says to himself that he wants a girlfriend no matter who it is. He then notices a miniature Midori attached to where his right hand used to be. Because of this, the pair must learn how to adapt to this sudden and forced closeness.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
:
:A 16-year-old girl who ends up as Seiji&#x27;s right hand. She has had a crush on him for three years. One day, she wishes to be with him, so much so that she finds herself in the place of his right hand. This causes problems for him, since it is his &quot;Devil&#x27;s Right Hand&quot; that he punches with. Midori&#x27;s real body is in a coma, and her mother tries everything to bring her back.
:
:A 17-year-old delinquent student who is feared for his fighting skills. Seiji fights to protect the weak using his powerful &quot;Devil&#x27;s Right Hand&quot;, and is nicknamed &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Sawamura. Fighting people has a price, however: everyone, including girls, fear him. He has gone seventeen years without a girlfriend and wants one badly.

===Secondary characters===
:
:The class representative for Seiji&#x27;s class. She originally detested him, but after Seiji saves her from a gang, she begins to harbor a secret attraction to him. Unfortunately for her, all of her plans to confess her feelings to him fail, either through Seiji&#x27;s obliviousness or outside circumstances.
:
:Seiji&#x27;s violent older sister. She is the former leader of a powerful street gang, and her favorite hobbies are drinking, beating up Seiji, and taking his allowance. She was the one who taught him how to fight when they were young.
:
:A childhood friend of Midori&#x27;s who is also a fellow first year at Ogurabashi High School. He was always in love with Midori, but over the course of the series, he manages to develop feelings for Seiji that make the miniature Midori extremely nervous.
:
:A year-younger student at Seiji&#x27;s school and or underclassman of Seiji. He idolizes Seiji for his fighting skills and is arguably the closest thing to a friend Seiji had before Midori. However, he seemingly can not keep himself out of trouble as he constantly gets caught by rival gangs.
:
:A classmate of Seiji&#x27;s who is a doll otaku. He always carries around a doll of a fictional anime character named Ultra-Marin, and seems to have a creepy obsession with the character. He is also good at making clothes for dolls, a talent which means an expanded wardrobe for the miniature Midori when he finds out Seiji&#x27;s secret.
:
:A 10-year-old neighbor of Seiji&#x27;s who has a crush on him. She tries a variety of ways to gain his attention, even going as far as asking Rin what kind of woman Seiji likes. However, he never takes her advances seriously as he still treats her like a child.
:
:Midori&#x27;s mother who is worried about her. Haruka is willing to do anything to cure Midori of her illness. She is very sad about Midori&#x27;s coma and tries several times to bring her back.

===Other characters===
:She is an American exchange student who transferred into Seiji&#x27;s high school (more precisely, into Miyahara&#x27;s class). She loves Japanese pop culture, especially samurai movies, and admires Seiji because she sees him as an ideal Japanese man.
:A silent, mysterious girl in Seiji&#x27;s class. She loves strange phenomena, and thus takes an interest in Seiji&#x27;s transformed right hand. She seemingly appears at the strangest times, which gives Seiji quite a scare.
:Nao&#x27;s father who is a doctor. He always attempts to capture Seiji so he can dissect him to show Midori to the medical community and gain fame from his findings. While his attempts are usually foiled by Nao, Seiji and Midori occasionally do this as well.
:Rin&#x27;s boyfriend, Sakisaka is a treasure hunter and loves to travel the world. However, his constant disappearances annoy Rin to no end.
:She is the leader of the Crimson Angels (&quot;Kurenai Benten&quot;), an all-female gang who constantly harasses and embarrasses Kouta (most notably by dressing him up in girl&#x27;s clothing). Despite this, she has a soft spot for the boy and later helps him out when he tries to separate Seiji and Midori.
:Yukina Asano is Seiji&#x27;s first (sort of) girlfriend and childhood sweetheart. She had become friends with him when they were both 10 years old, but since she had to move away, they did not see each other for seven years until a chance meeting at a place of mutual memory.
:An 11th-grader who is one of the popular and best students at Seiji&#x27;s school, and the daughter of a trading company&#x27;s chairman. For her popularity, she has earned the unofficial nickname &quot;kamakiri fujin&quot; (&quot;praying mantis&quot;).

<doc id="939352" wikidata="Q1889932" url="?curid=939352" title="Wipers (band)">
<text>Wipers was a punk rock band formed in Portland, Oregon, in 1977 by guitarist and vocalist Greg Sage, along with drummer Sam Henry and bassist Dave Koupal. The group&#x27;s tight song structure and use of heavy distortion were hailed as extremely influential by numerous critics and musicians. In particular, Nirvana&#x27;s lead singer, Kurt Cobain acknowledged that they had heavily influenced him. They are also considered to be the first Pacific Northwest punk band.

==History==

===Origins===
Sage&#x27;s intense interest in music began with cutting records at home as an adolescent.

Inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Sage soon picked up the guitar; further, in 1969, at age 17, he played on an eponymous album by professional wrestler Beauregarde.

===Foundation, early years===
Sage founded Wipers in Portland in 1977 along with drummer Henry and bassist Koupal, originally just as a recording project. The plan was to record 15 albums in 10 years without touring or promotion. Sage thought that the mystique built from the lack of playing traditional rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll would make people listen to their recordings much deeper with only their imagination to go by. He thought it would be easy to avoid press, shows, pictures and interviews. He looked at music as art rather than entertainment; he thought music was personal to the listener rather than a commodity.

Wipers&#x27; first single, &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, was released in 1978 on Sage&#x27;s own Trap Records.

Sage wanted to make his own recordings and manufacture and run his own label without outside financing. In 1979, Sage approached several Portland punk bands (including Neo Boys, Sado-Nation and Stiphnoyds) and asked them to record singles for his new Trap label.

The Wipers first album, &quot;Is This Real?&quot;, was issued in January 1980 on Park Avenue Records, a label that the band hoped would gain them wider distribution. It was originally recorded on a 4-track in the band&#x27;s rehearsal studio, but the label insisted that the band use a professional studio. Once released, the album gained a cult following, although the band was best known for their live shows around the Portland area.

Henry left to join the Rats, and Koupal moved to Ohio.

Later in 1980, Park Avenue released the &quot;Alien Boy&quot; EP, consisting of the title track and three demo outtakes.

With the new rhythm section of bassist Brad Davidson and drummer Brad Naish (ex-Stiphnoyds), Wipers recorded a second album for Park Avenue, the last for that label. &quot;Youth of America&quot;, released in 1981, contrasted with the short/fast punk songs of the time. According to Sage, this change of pace was a reaction against the punk trend of releasing short songs. The album was, according to Sage, not well received in the United States at the time of its release, though it did fare better in Europe. Along with other Wipers records, &quot;Youth of America&quot; came to be acknowledged as an important album in the development of American underground and independent rock movements of the early 80s.

The next album, &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, issued in 1983 by Trap via Brain Eater Records, was the first Wipers record to gain significant modern rock airplay. It was led by the song, &quot;Romeo&quot;, which had already been released the previous year as a 7&quot; single by Trap. The band then embarked on their first extensive tour, documented on the &quot;Wipers Tour 84&quot; cassette-only live album, which was reissued by Enigma Records in 1985 as &quot;Wipers&quot;.

In 1985, Naish was replaced by Steve Plouf, and Enigma issued Sage&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Straight Ahead&quot;.

Signing to Enigma&#x27;s Restless Records division, Wipers released 1986&#x27;s &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, featuring the song &quot;Let Me Know&quot;, used in the film &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Follow Blind&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Circle&quot; (1988). All three records were recorded in Sage&#x27;s studio 421 Sound.

In 1989, drummer Travis McNabb joined Wipers for a tour, during which Sage announced that the band was ending due to music business frustrations and the loss of their studio space. Sage then relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, and Davidson left to move to London. After building a new recording studio in Arizona, Sage released a second solo album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Sacrifice (For Love)&quot;.

Two compilations were released in this era: &quot;The Best of Wipers and Greg Sage&quot; in 1990 by Restless, and &quot;Complete Rarities &#x27;78–&#x27;90&quot; in 1993 by Germany&#x27;s True Believer Records. The latter included the first Wipers 7&quot;, the B-side of the &quot;Romeo&quot; 7&quot;, sampler contributions, and live material from 1986 and 1989.

Sage restarted Wipers in 1993, rejoined by Plouf, releasing three additional albums as a duo: &quot;Silver Sail&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Herd&quot; (1996), both on the Tim/Kerr label, and &quot;Power in One&quot; (1999) on Sage&#x27;s new Zeno Records. The band became inactive after 1999.

In 2001, Zeno released &quot;Wipers Box Set&quot;, which included the first three Wipers albums, which by that time had been long out-of-print, along with the songs from the &quot;Alien Boy&quot; EP and additional previously unreleased material. Jackpot Records and Sage later reissued &quot;Is This Real?,&quot; &quot;Youth of America&quot; and &quot;Over the Edge&quot; on vinyl.

===Post-Wipers===
Henry formed Napalm Beach with Chris Newman in 1982. He remained an active musician in Portland, Oregon, and continued to play with Napalm Beach and Don&#x27;t, as well as popular Pacific Northwest songwriters such as Pete Krebs, Morgan Grace and Jimmy Boyer. Henry died from complications of stomach cancer on February 20, 2022, at the age of 65.

Plouf operated a vintage goods/Zeno Records store in Portland, appropriately named Zeno Oddities, which closed sometime between 2009 and 2010.

McNabb formed the Beggars, and went on to work as a session and tour drummer for artists including Vigilantes of Love, Billy Pilgrim, Shawn Mullins, Indigo Girls, Brendan Benson, Howie Day, Dar Williams, Mandi Perkins, Big &amp; Rich and Gavin DeGraw. McNabb was a member of Better Than Ezra from 1996 to 2009. In 2007, he joined bluegrass/country music act Sugarland.

Davidson (who had previously recorded with the Sage-produced Rancid Vat in 1985) played bass on The Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s 1993 EP &quot;Sound of Speed&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
Sage later remarked on their initial reception: &quot;We weren&#x27;t even really a punk band. See, we were even farther out in left field than the punk movement because we didn&#x27;t even wish to be classified, and that was kind of a new territory. ... When we put out &quot;Is This Real?&quot; ... it definitely did not fit in; none of our records did. Then nine, ten years later people are saying: &#x27;Yeah, it&#x27;s the punk classic of the &#x27;80s&#x27;&quot;.

In 1992, tribute album &quot;Eight Songs for Greg Sage and the Wipers&quot; was released by Tim/Kerr as a box set of four colored 7&quot; records, featuring Wipers songs performed by Nirvana, Hole, Napalm Beach, M99, Dharma Bums, Crackerbash, Poison Idea, and the Whirlees. The expanded CD release, retitled &quot;Fourteen Songs for Greg Sage and the Wipers&quot;, also included covers by Hazel, Calamity Jane, Saliva Tree, Honey, Nation of Ulysses, and Thurston Moore and Keith Nealy.

Wipers had a great influence on Nirvana. For example, fans can hear similarities between the bass line of Wipers&#x27; song &quot;Potential Suicide&quot; and Nirvana&#x27;s track &quot;Breed&quot;. Wipers gained significant exposure as a result of Nirvana&#x27;s 1992 covers of two songs from &quot;Is This Real?&quot; (&quot;D-7&quot; on the EP &quot;Hormoaning&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Rat&quot; on the &quot;Eight Songs&quot; compilation. &quot;D-7&quot; was also released as a B-side on the UK CD single release of &quot;Lithium&quot; and played as part of Nirvana&#x27;s 1992 live show that was later released as &quot;Live At Reading).&quot; Kurt Cobain&#x27;s list of his top 50 albums, probably written in 1993, included the first three Wipers&#x27; albums. His wife, Courtney Love, whose band Hole covered &quot;Over the Edge&quot; both on recording and frequently at live performances, was also influenced by the band. German grunge band, Alien Boys named themselves from Wipers song Alien Boy. Other bands that have cited Wipers as an influence include Mudhoney, Cloud Nothings, Hot Snakes, and Metz.

<text>The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood (, &quot;Tserkovʹ Spasa na Krovi&quot;) is a Russian Orthodox church in Saint Petersburg, Russia which currently functions as a secular museum and church at the same time. The structure was constructed between 1883 and 1907. It is one of Saint Petersburg&#x27;s major attractions.

The church was erected on the site where Narodnaya Volya members assassinated Emperor Alexander II in March 1881. The church was funded by the Romanov imperial family in honor of Alexander II, and the suffix &quot;on [Spilled] Blood&quot; refers to his assassination.

==History ==
Construction began in 1883 during the reign of Alexander III, two years after the assassination of his father Alexander II. The church was consecrated as a memorial to his father. Estimates suggest that the construction cost 4.5 million rubles. The construction was completed during the reign of Nicholas II in 1907. Funding was provided by the Imperial family with the support of many private donors.

The church is prominently situated along the Griboedov Canal; paved roads run along both sides of the canal. On March 13, 1881 (Julian date: March 1), as Alexander II&#x27;s carriage passed along the embankment, a grenade thrown by an anarchist conspirator exploded. The tsar, shaken but unhurt, got out of the carriage and started to remonstrate with the presumed culprit. A second conspirator took the chance to throw another bomb, killing himself and mortally wounding the tsar. The tsar, bleeding heavily, was taken back to the Winter Palace, where he died a few hours later.

A temporary shrine was erected on the site of the attack while plans and fundraising for a more permanent memorial were undertaken. In order to build a permanent shrine on the exact spot where the assassination took place, it was decided to narrow the canal so that the section of road on which the tsar had been driving could be included within the walls of the church. An elaborate shrine, in the form of a ciborium, was constructed at the end of the church opposite the altar, on the exact place of Alexander&#x27;s assassination. It is embellished with topaz, lazurite and other semi-precious stones, making a striking contrast with the simple cobblestones of the old road, which are exposed in the floor of the shrine.

==Architecture==

Architecturally, the cathedral differs from Saint Petersburg&#x27;s other structures. The city&#x27;s architecture is predominantly Baroque and Neoclassical, but the Savior on Blood harks back to medieval Russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism. It intentionally resembles the 17th-century Yaroslavl churches and the celebrated St. Basil&#x27;s Cathedral in Moscow.
The church contains over 7500 square meters of mosaics—according to its restorers, more than any other church in the world. This record may be surpassed by the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, which houses 7700 square meters of mosaics.
The interior was designed by some of the most celebrated Russian artists of the day—including Viktor Vasnetsov, Mikhail Nesterov and Mikhail Vrubel – but the church&#x27;s chief architect, Alfred Alexandrovich Parland, was relatively little-known (born in Saint Petersburg in 1842 in a Baltic-German Lutheran family). Perhaps not surprisingly, the church&#x27;s construction ran well over budget, having been estimated at 3.6 million rubles but ending up costing over 4.6 million. The walls and ceilings inside the church are completely covered in intricately detailed mosaics – the main pictures being biblical scenes or figures – but with very fine patterned borders setting off each picture.

==Russian Revolution of 1917==

In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the church was ransacked and looted, badly damaging its interior. The Soviet government closed the church in 1932. During the Second World War when many people were starving due to the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi German military forces, the church was used as a temporary morgue for those who died in combat and from starvation and illness. The church suffered significant damage. After the war, it was used as a warehouse for vegetables, leading to the sardonic name of &quot;Saviour on Potatoes&quot;.
==Modern usage ==
In July 1970, management of the church passed to Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral and it was used as a museum. The proceeds from the Cathedral funded the restoration of the church. It was reopened in August 1997, after 27 years of restoration, but has not been reconsecrated and does not function as a full-time place of worship. The Church of the Saviour on Blood is a museum of mosaics. In the pre-Revolution period it was not used as a public place of worship. The church was dedicated to the memory of the assassinated tsar and only panikhidas (memorial services) took place. The church is now one of the main tourist attractions in Saint Petersburg.

== Holy Gates ==
In 2005, the State Museum of St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral began the recreation of the Holy Gates (permanently lost in the 1920s during the Soviet period). Entirely produced with enamels and based on the pictures and lithographies of the time, the new Holy Gates were designed by V. J. Nikolsky and S. G. Kochetova and reified by the famous enamel artist L. Solomnikova and her atelier. Orthodox bishop Amvrosij of Gatchina celebrated the consecration of these new Holy Gates on 14 March 2012, the 129th anniversary of Alexander II&#x27;s assassination.

==In popular culture==

*The church appears on the cover of the 2011 contemporary classical album &quot;Troika&quot;.
*The church is featured in the alternate history comic &quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot;, as the location of the facility where Hugo Strange creates Power Girl on behalf of the Soviet government during the Siege of Leningrad.
*The church was visited during the seventeenth season of the CBS reality show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and also hosted a Pit Stop during the third season of the Australian variant &quot;The Amazing Race Australia&quot;.
*The church is seen in the opening sequence of the animated movie Anastasia, that is placed in Saint Petersburg.

<doc id="939375" wikidata="Q1550791" url="?curid=939375" title="NASA X-38">
<text>The X-38 is an experimental re-entry vehicle designed by NASA to research a possible emergency crew return vehicle (CRV) for the International Space Station (ISS). The 1995–2002 program also developed concepts for a crew return vehicle design that could be modified for other uses, such as a possible joint U.S. and international human spacecraft that could be launched on the French Ariane 5 booster.

The program would eventually develop a total of three test prototype flight demonstrators for the proposed Crew Return Vehicle, each having incremental improvements on its predecessor. All three were wingless lifting body vehicles used in drop tests. The X-38 program was canceled in 2002 due to budget cuts.

==History==


With crew being taken to the ISS by space shuttle, the maximum crew size for the ISS would be dependent on crew rescue capacity. Since it is imperative that the crew members be able to return to Earth in case of an unexpected emergency, a Crew Return Vehicle able to hold up to seven crew members was initially planned by the ISS program leadership. This would have allowed the full complement of seven astronauts to live and work on the ISS.

During the early years of ISS on-orbit construction, the crew was limited to three, corresponding to a single Russian Soyuz TMA vehicle that could be docked to the station at any given time. Later in May 2009 provisions were added for a total of two docked Soyuz vehicles simultaneously and the ISS crew was increased to 6 members. NASA has designed several crew return vehicles over the years with varying levels of detail.

A small, in-house development study of the X-38 concept first began at Johnson Space Center (JSC) in early 1995; however, several types of emergency scenarios were recognized by NASA as early as 1992 that drove the need for crew return from the International Space Station:

# A serious illness or injury to a station astronaut
# A fire or collision with space debris
# Grounding of the space shuttle so that it could not deliver life-sustaining supplies.

In early 1996, a contract was awarded to Scaled Composites, Inc., of Mojave, Calif., for the construction of three full-scale atmospheric test airframes. The first vehicle airframe was delivered to JSC in September 1996.

==Development==
In an unusual move for an X-plane, the program involved the European Space Agency and the German Space Agency DLR. It was originally called X-35. The program manager was John Muratore, while the Flight Test Engineer was future NASA astronaut Michael E. Fossum.

Rob Meyerson, who later went on to become President of Blue Origin, was an early member of the team.

The X-38 design used a wingless lifting body concept originally developed by the U.S. Air Force in the mid-1960s during the X-24 program. R. Dale Reed worked for NASA from 1955-2000 and is considered the Father of the Lifting Body Programs. He met with Muratore (1992-93) and shared his design of the X-24A that he used to present the concept of the X-38 to NASA (Wingless Flight, Chapter 9, pages 186-88).

The X-38 program used uncrewed mockups to test the CRV design. Flight models were indicated with the letter V for &quot;Vehicle&quot; followed by a number.
*X-38 V-131
*X-38 V-132
*X-38 V-131-R, which was the V-131 prototype reworked with a modified shell.
*X-38 V-201, which was an orbital prototype to be launched by the Space Shuttle.
*X-38 V-121, V-133 and V-301 were also foreseen, but were never built.

The X-38 V-131 and V-132 shared the aerodynamic shape of the X-24A. This shape had to be enlarged for the Crew Return Vehicle needs (crew of seven astronauts) and redesigned, especially in the rear part, which became thicker.

The X-38 V-131-R was designed at 80 percent of the size of a CRV [, , ], and featured the final redesigned shape (Two later versions, V-133 and V-201, were planned at 100 percent of the CRV size). The 80% scale versions were flown at 15,000 to 24,000 pound weight. The X-38 V-201 orbital prototype was 90 percent complete, but never flown.

In drop tests the V-131, V-132 and V-131-R were dropped by a B-52 from altitudes of up to 45,000 ft (13,700 m), gliding at near transonic speeds before deploying a drogue parachute to slow them to . The later prototypes had their descent continue under a parafoil wing, the largest ever made. Flight control was mostly autonomous, backed up by a ground-based pilot.
==Design==



The X-38 was intended to be semi-permanently docked to the ISS. If the crew became sick or injured during the course of their mission, they would enter the rescue vehicle through a hatched docking mechanism. With execution of a short procedure, the crew return vehicles would automatically fly the crew members safely to Earth. Once undocked, the vehicle would be deorbited using a deorbital propulsion system (DPS). The eight-thruster DPS would adjust the spacecraft&#x27;s attitude and retrofire to slow the X-38 down, allowing gravitational attraction to pull it back into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. A DPS module was developed by Aerojet and delivered to Johnson Space Center in 2002 for V-201.

Following the jettison of the DPS, the X-38 would have glided from orbit and used a steerable parafoil for its final descent and landing. The high speeds at which lifting body aircraft operate can make them challenging to land. The parafoil would have been used to slow the vehicle and make landing easier. The landing gear consisted of skids rather than wheels: the skids worked like sleds so the vehicle would have slid to a stop on the ground.

Both the shape and size of the X-38 were different from that of the Space Shuttle. The Crew Return Vehicle would have fitted into the payload bay of the shuttle. This does not, however, mean that it would have been small. The X-38 weighed 10,660 kg and was 9.1 meters long. The battery system, lasting nine hours, was to be used for power and life support. If the Crew Return Vehicle was needed, it would only take two to three hours for it to reach Earth.

The parafoil parachute, employed for landing, was derived from technology developed by the U.S. Army. This massive parafoil deploys in 5 stages for optimum performance. A drag chute would have been released from the rear of the X-38. This drag chute would have been used to stabilize and slow the vehicle down. The parafoil (area of 687 square meters) was then released. It would open in five steps (a process called staging). While the staging process only takes 45 seconds, it is important for a successful chute deployment. Staging prevents high-speed winds from tearing the parafoil.

The spacecraft&#x27;s landing was to be completely automated. Mission Control would have sent coordinates to the onboard computer system. This system would also have used wind sensors and the Global Positioning System (a satellite-based coordinate system) to coordinate a safe trip home. Since the Crew Return Vehicle was designed with medical emergencies in mind, it made sense that the vehicle could find its way home automatically in the event that crew members were incapacitated or injured. If there was a need, the crew would have the capability to operate the vehicle by switching to the backup systems. In addition, seven high-altitude low-opening (HALO) parachute packs were included in the crew cabin, a measure designed to provide for the ability to bail out of the craft.

An Advanced Docking Berthing System (ADBS) was designed for the X-38 and the work on it led to the Low Impact Docking System the Johnson Space Center later created for the planned vehicles in Project Constellation.

The X-38 vehicle was also known as the X-35 (but that designation was already allocated by the USAF to Lockheed Martin&#x27;s entry in the Joint Strike Fighter Program) and the X-CRV (experimental - Crew Return Vehicle).

==Cancellation ==
Severe cost overruns plagued the ISS program during its development and construction during the late 1990s and early 2000s. To bring costs under control the International Space Station Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task Force was created. The task force introduced a new concept known as &quot;American Core Complete&quot;, whereby the U.S. would unilaterally reduce the previously agreed-upon American contributions to the ISS while retaining its role as the controlling member of the International partners. Core Complete (as opposed to the originally planned &quot;Station Complete&quot;) deleted the American Habitation Module, the American CRV, and Node-3 from the ISS design without any negotiations with international partners. NASA Administrator, Sean O&#x27;Keefe, appointed by President George W. Bush, stated in December 2001 that he intended to adhere to the recommendations of the IMCE, including the implementation of Core Complete. The X-38 project cancellation was announced on April 29, 2002 as a cost-cutting measure in accordance with the IMCE&#x27;s recommendations.

The Core Complete concept was roundly criticized by many experts at the time since a majority of development work on the X-38 had been completed. The prototype space vehicle was approximately 90% complete at the time it was cancelled.

<doc id="939380" wikidata="Q603432" url="?curid=939380" title="List of Mario franchise characters">
<text>The &quot;Mario&quot; franchise is a video game series created by Nintendo. Nintendo is usually the developer and publisher of the franchise&#x27;s games, but various games are developed by third-party companies such as Intelligent Systems and Nintendo Cube. Games in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise primarily revolve around the main protagonist Mario and often involve the trope of Bowser as the main antagonist kidnapping Princess Peach, with Mario then rescuing her. Many characters have goals or plot arcs that vary between series; for example, the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; games focus on Luigi ridding a haunted building of ghost-like creatures known as Boos, and Wario stars in games that center around his greed and desire for money and treasure.

The franchise began with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; in 1981, where Mario, Donkey Kong, and Pauline originated. Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto built them off the base of characters from &quot;Popeye&quot;. Unable to license the characters, Miyamoto made later changes to their appearances and personalities, such as a more lighthearted tone. Due to the breakthrough critical and commercial success of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Mario reappeared in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; in 1983, which introduced Mario&#x27;s twin brother Luigi, and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in 1985, which introduced Toad alongside numerous enemies, with Bowser and Princess Peach replacing Donkey Kong and Pauline, respectively.

Each series has introduced numerous characters, many of them recurring. Some have starred in their own games or in supporting roles. The games all typically share common enemies.

== Primary protagonists ==
=== Mario ===

 (voiced by Kevin Afghani) is the main character of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise and the mascot of Nintendo as a whole. He originally appeared in 1981&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; as &quot;Jumpman&quot;, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. While Mario was initially a carpenter, he later took the role of a plumber. From 1992 to 2023, Mario was voiced by Charles Martinet. In most of his appearances, Mario rescues a damsel in distress (often Princess Peach) from an antagonist (often Bowser). Mario&#x27;s younger brother is Luigi, and his greedy rival is Wario. Yoshi serves as Mario&#x27;s steed in several games, including &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. Since his introduction, Mario&#x27;s abilities include jumping, such as onto an enemy&#x27;s head as an attack. Mario uses power-ups, such as the Super Mushroom (which allows him to grow larger and survive an additional hit), the Super Star (which grants him temporary invincibility), and the Fire Flower (which allows him to throw fireballs). Several power-ups grant Mario the ability to fly, such as the Super Leaf from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Mario is the second most recognizable video game character after Pac-Man. Mario has seen numerous cultural appearances, such as during the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics, where Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe appeared dressed as the character. Mario has appeared as the protagonist in two feature films: the live-action &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in 1993 and the animated box office hit &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; in 2023.

Mario was voiced by Chris Pratt in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;.

=== Luigi ===

 (voiced by Kevin Afghani) is the younger twin brother of Mario, who Luigi feels a sense of envy and reverence towards. In the 1983 game &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, Luigi was introduced as the second player character, with many similarities to Mario. While he was initially identical to Mario, he began developing differences in &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot; (1986), which gave him a higher and further jump at the expense of responsiveness and precision. In the North American version of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (1988), Luigi was given a taller and thinner appearance than Mario, which played a key role in shaping his modern appearance. Luigi&#x27;s first starring role was in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot;, though he played only minor roles in subsequent games until 2001 with &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, where he plays the role of a frightened, unsure, and goofy protagonist attempting to save his brother. The Year of Luigi was celebrated in 2013, which saw many &quot;Luigi&quot; games released to commemorate the character&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

Luigi also appeared in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series as an unlockable fighter, and the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series. He was voiced by Charlie Day in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;.

=== Princess Peach ===

 (voiced by Samantha Kelly) is the princess of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise&#x27;s Mushroom Kingdom. In the main series games, she typically plays the role of a damsel in distress who needs to be rescued by Mario. When playable, she typically has the ability to float in the air, and is physically taller than Mario. Her first playable appearance in a main series &quot;Mario&quot; game was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, while her second was 2013&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot;. Peach played a starring role in &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot; (2005), where she aims to rescue Mario, Luigi, and Toad, aided by a parasol named Perry and several abilities based on her emotions—or &quot;vibes&quot;. She makes frequent appearances in spin-off &quot;Mario&quot; games, such as the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series and the &quot;Mario&quot; sports games. In the 2017 game &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, after being captured by and forced to marry Bowser, and subsequently rescued by Mario, she rejects both of them and instead takes a trip around the world, though Mario rejoins her. Peach again stars in her adventure in the 2024 game &quot;Princess Peach: Showtime!&quot;, where she saves the Sparkle Theater from a sorceress named Grape, helped by a ribbon named Stella and various transformations including Swordfighter Peach and Patissiere Peach.

Since 2001, Peach appeared in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series as a fighter alongside Bowser in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, and later in its succeeded games. She was voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;.

=== Princess Daisy ===

 (voiced by Giselle Fernandez) is the princess of Sarasaland, the setting of &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; (1989). Since then, she has primarily appeared as a playable character in spin-off &quot;Mario&quot; games, especially &quot;Mario&quot; sports games. &quot;Super Mario Run&quot; (2016) marks Daisy&#x27;s playable debut in a main series game, where she is able to perform a double jump. She acts more tomboyish than Princess Peach, exemplified by her appearances in the &quot;Mario&quot; sports games. Some consider her and Luigi to be a couple, despite Daisy being rescued by Mario in &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Run&quot;. She is also a playable character in &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder.&quot; Daisy also appeared in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, beginning with 2003&#x27;s &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, beginning with 2018&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as Peach&#x27;s echo-fighter.

=== Toad ===

He debuted in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), though his first starring role was in &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; (1994), in which the player is able to control Toad to solve puzzles. Toad made his playable debut in a main series &quot;Mario&quot; game in 1988 with &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, and frequently acts as a non-playable character in &quot;Mario&quot; role-playing games. The character is a member of the eponymous Toad species, which includes characters such as Captain Toad, Toadette, and Toadsworth. He was voiced by Keegan-Michael Key in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023).

=== Yoshi ===

 (voiced by Kazumi Totaka) is a green anthropomorphic dinosaur character, first appeared in the 1990 game &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. He is depicted with a long tongue that can be used to eat enemies, and can turn the enemies he eats into eggs that release power-ups or can be thrown. Yoshi is a rideable character for the heroes or a playable character in most of the &quot;Mario&quot; spin-offs, including his own series. Yoshi also appeared in &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series as a fighter, and &quot;Mario Party&quot; series.

=== Donkey Kong ===

 (voiced by Takashi Nagasako) is an anthropomorphic gorilla that stars in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; franchise. He is the leader of the Kong Family, a group of various primates and is depicted as the grandson of Cranky Kong who appeared in the 1981 arcade game, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, though, he appears as an antagonist in the &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; series. He is depicted as a cheerful and powerful character. Alongside Mario and friends, Donkey Kong also appeared in &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series as a fighter, and &quot;Mario Party&quot; series.

Donkey Kong was voiced by Seth Rogen in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;.

She was created by Shigeru Miyamoto, is the earliest example of a female with a speaking role in a video game, and is cited as a famous example of a damsel in distress in fiction. She is the mayor of New Donk City in &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;.

=== Birdo ===
Birdo, also known as Birdette, and known in Japan as (voiced by Kazumi Totaka) is depicted as a pink, anthropomorphic dinosaur who wears a red bow on her head, and has a round mouth that can fire eggs as projectiles. Birdo first appeared in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; as a recurring boss character. Since then, she has been a recurring playable character in various franchise spin-offs. Birdo has been referred to as a &quot;man who thinks of himself as female&quot; in earlier depictions, such as in the Japanese manual for the early prototype game &quot;Doki Doki Panic&quot;, and was considered female in later games. It is heavily speculated that Birdo is transgender; she is considered to be one of the first ever transgender video game characters.

 is portrayed as Yoshi&#x27;s helper dog. He debuted in &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; and continued appearing throughout the &quot;Yoshi&quot; series, such as in &quot;Poochy &amp; Yoshi&#x27;s Woolly World&quot;. In the games, he can do things that Yoshi cannot, such as sniff out hidden items, cross over dangerous terrain, and jump over walls to give Yoshi a boost out of his wall jumps. In 2023, Poochy was added to &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; as a playable character.

=== Professor E. Gadd ===
 (voiced by Kazumi Totaka), more commonly known as Professor E. Gadd, is a diminutive and elderly scientist and inventor. He primarily appears in the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; series, in which he invented several objects, such as Luigi&#x27;s Poltergust 3000 and Gooigi from &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3&quot;. He is referenced in &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; as the inventor of Mario&#x27;s F.L.U.D.D., a device that allows him to spray water. The character has made cameo appearances in series such as &quot;Mario Party&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot;. He makes ambiguous gibberish sounds when speaking, inspired by the language of &quot;Animalese&quot; used in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series when Totaka invented his voice.

In &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time&quot;, he is revealed to have cared for the princess since she was a baby.

=== Toadette ===
 (voiced by Samantha Kelly) is a pink Toad character who debuted in &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; (2003) as a playable driver. Toadette is depicted with two long round pigtails with white spots and a dress, to distinguish her from Toad. Since &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, Toadette is a member of the Toad Brigade and has the role of an archivist. Depending on the game, she is either a supporting character or a protagonist, playable in most of the &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games. In &quot;New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe&quot;, a power-up called the Super Crown allows Toadette to transform into Peachette, a form that highly resembles Princess Peach. As Peachette, she can use Peach&#x27;s floating jump to hover, and can perform a double jump. She also returns as a playable character in &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&quot;.

One particular Luma, known as Baby Luma, or Young Master Luma, is a major character in the &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; games, granting Mario or Luigi the power to Star Spin.

Williams, and Morton Downey Jr.); in the case of Larry, Brooks initially stated that the character was named after Larry Mullen Jr., an Irish musician, best known as the drummer and co-founder of the rock band U2, only to contradict this in a later interview where he instead states the name was given simply because he felt that the character &quot;looked like a Larry&quot;.

The Koopalings were originally established as Bowser&#x27;s children. Older &quot;Mario&quot; games maintain reference to them as such in updated manuals and re-releases. They have since been depicted as Bowser&#x27;s minions in games following the release of &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; in 2009, with Shigeru Miyamoto stating in 2012 that &quot;our current story is that the seven Koopalings are not Bowser&#x27;s children. Bowser&#x27;s only child is Bowser Jr.&quot; The Koopalings have additionally appeared as playable characters in spin-off &quot;Mario&quot; games and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, and have been featured in non-video game &quot;Mario&quot; media including the animated &quot;Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. They are currently voiced by David J. Goldfarb, Carlee McManus, Dan Falcone, Ryan Higgins, Ashley Flannegan, David Cooke, and Michelle Hippe, respectively. Previously, in &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; and games that reuse its voice assets, Ludwig and Iggy had been voiced by Mike Vaughn, while the others, sans Roy, were previously voiced by Lani Minella.

=== Wario ===
 (voiced by Kevin Afghani) is an obese yet muscular, hot-tempered, and greedy man. He is Mario&#x27;s self-declared yellow-and-purple clad arch-rival. He initially debuted as an antagonist, but over the years has become an anti-hero, even being playable in a few games. Wario is the protagonist of the &quot;Wario&quot; series and is playable in most of the &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games where he is shown to be Waluigi&#x27;s partner. His name is portmanteau of &quot;warui&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;bad&quot;, and &quot;Mario&quot;. Wario&#x27;s favorite food is garlic, often used in gameplay to restore health when he gets defeated.

=== Kamek ===
 () is a member of the fictional Magikoopa species who is Bowser&#x27;s childhood caretaker, and later in life one of his high-ranking minions. Kamek is the main antagonist of the &quot;Yoshi&quot; series, and first appeared in the 1995 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. In his various game appearances, his magic includes self-duplication, teleportation, shooting magical blasts, and changing the size of other creatures. He is often distinguished from other Magikoopas by the broom he rides on. In Japan, his species is also named Kamek, but outside Japan they are called Magikoopas.

Kamek returns in the 2009 Wii video game &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; and its 2012 Wii U sequel as a recurring supporting antagonist and boss character. Kamek also makes non-playable appearances in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; and &quot;Paper Mario&quot; series in various roles, and made playable appearances as an unlockable character in the 2012 Wii video game &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; and the 2014 Nintendo 3DS video game &quot;Mario Golf: World Tour&quot;. Kamek&#x27;s non-playable appearance in &quot;Mario Party 8&quot; was controversial and caused the game to be recalled in the United Kingdom, as some of his in-game dialogue contained the word &quot;spastic&quot;, which is considered very offensive to disabled people in the UK. Additionally, Kamek has had minor cameo appearances in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

A prototype of &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; for the Nintendo 64 featured Kamek as one of the eight playable characters, but the character was replaced with Donkey Kong in the final game. Kamek would later become a playable character made available for the &quot;Kamek Tour&quot; in a 2021 update to the 2019 mobile game &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot;. In 2023, he was added to &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot; as part of the Booster Course Pass, marking his first appearance in a console &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game.

Kamek was voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;, who based Kamek’s voice on Peter Lorre.

=== Mini Bowser ===
 also referred to exclusively in North America as Koopa Kid and initially mistranslated as Baby Bowser, describes both an individual and a group of Bowser&#x27;s minions bearing similar design elements to the latter. They appear exclusively in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; sub-series of video games, where their role is generally to hinder player&#x27;s progress by stealing coins needed for progression or confronting the player in minigames.

While Mini Bowser would initially continue to rise in relevance throughout the series, becoming the plot&#x27;s main antagonistic force as well as a playable character by &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; and being the subject of a dedicated mode in &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot;, he has also become an example of Nintendo phasing out certain characters from the &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise, with him having been replaced by the more recently introduced Bowser Jr. in newer games of the series, netting him the reputation of being &quot;another neglected classic Nintendo character&quot;. Both the reason for this disappearance as well as his actual relation to Bowser is a subject of fan speculation, due to regional differences concerning in-game texts and manuals implying Mini Bowser to either be a child, younger version or simple henchman of Bowser.

=== Waluigi ===
 is a tall, thin, and mischievous man who was introduced in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; as Wario&#x27;s partner of unspecified relation. He is Luigi&#x27;s black-and-purple clad arch-rival. Waluigi is often an antagonist who teams up with Wario to accomplish their schemes. He is playable in most of the &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games, and makes several cameos within the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Like with Wario, his name is a portmanteau of &quot;warui&quot; and &quot;Luigi&quot;.

=== King Boo ===
 is the king of the Boos, and is the main antagonist of the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; series. He plays minor roles, occasionally playable, in various other &quot;Mario&quot; games, including the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Mario Party&quot; series. King Boo&#x27;s first major debuted role was as the final boss of &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, where he disguised himself as Bowser. He is depicted as much larger than the average Boos that appear in games after &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;. He dons a crown with a large ruby, and has glowing, sunken eyes in the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; franchise. A similar character named Big Boo is an enemy in &quot;Super Mario World&quot; and a boss in &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;. Additionally, a different character also named King Boo, known as Boss Boo in Japan, appears as a boss in &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;.

=== Bowser Jr. ===
 in Japan; voiced by Caety Sagoian), or sometimes simply Jr. or Junior, is the son of Bowser, who first appeared in the 2002 Nintendo GameCube game &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;. He is often depicted as the secondary antagonist throughout the &quot;Mario&quot; series. In the games, Bowser Jr. looks up to his dad, and shares his ambition to defeat Mario, and take over the world and the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser Jr. is playable in most of the spin-off &quot;Mario&quot; games, and in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; He is the main protagonist of &quot;Bowser Jr.&#x27;s Journey&quot; (2018) included in the remake of &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot;.

=== Petey Piranha ===
, known as in Japan, is a large, powerful Piranha Plant character. Whereas normal Piranha Plants are usually depicted growing from pipes, Petey&#x27;s leaves and roots are foot-like and arm-like appendages, allowing the character to use objects such as tennis rackets and golf clubs when playable in the various &quot;Mario&quot; sports games. He can sometimes use his leaves to fly around. He debuted as the primary boss of Bianco Hills in the game &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;, returning as a minor boss in &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;. Similar Piranha Plant boss characters later appear in &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; and its sequel. Petey Piranha made his &quot;Mario Kart&quot; debut in &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; as a playable driver, and returns in &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;.

=== Fawful ===
 known in Japan as Gerakobits, is a recurring antagonist in the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series. The character is considered to be &quot;insane&quot;, and speaks in a chaotic manner. He served as the secondary antagonist of &quot;Superstar Saga&quot;, and the main antagonist of &quot;Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot;. He was also the main antagonist of &quot;Bowser’s Minions&quot;, which he brainwashed all of Bowser&#x27;s minions, and became Captain Goomba’s archenemy.

He was created by Masanori Sato, who worked as the illustrator for &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot;, the first game in the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series. Fawful&#x27;s localized Japanese name, Gerakobits, is derived from &quot;geragera&quot;, the Japanese onomatopoeia for a scornful laugh, while his English name is a pun combining the words &quot;awful&quot; and &quot;guffaw&quot;. Because Fawful was not based on any existing characters in the &quot;Mario&quot; series, the Nintendo Treehouse, which is responsible for localizing games for North American audiences, had more creative freedom in writing for the character. Bill Trinen and Nate Bihldorff, both employees of the Treehouse, wrote the English dialogue for Fawful through the exchange of notes. Rather than sticking close to the Japanese script, where Fawful simply adds &quot;Fururururu!&quot; to the end of every line, Trinen and Bihldorff intended to make Fawful as &quot;wacky&quot; and &quot;zainy&quot; as possible in the Western release. Thus, in English versions of the games, all of Fawful&#x27;s dialogue consists of broken English and word salads and his catchphrase, &quot;I have fury!&quot;.

Fawful has received critical acclaim from both critics and fans, regarded as a favorite villain. He is also regarded for his quotes and humor, nominated for the &quot;Most Quotable Character&quot; award in 2009, but losing to Ellis from &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s Jeremy Parish attributing the quality of &quot;Superstar Saga&quot;″s comedy to him. His &quot;I have fury!&quot; quote was included in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s collection of classic quotes from Nintendo games. Another quotation, &quot;I am the mustard of your doom!&quot; was regarded by &quot;MTV Multiplayer&quot; writer Steven Totilo as one of the most famous lines in video games of recent years and was quoted with &quot;uncommon frequency.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked Fawful as one of the best video game villains, arguing that he was a dominant aspect of the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series partly due to his quotes.

<text>Groby (pronounced &quot;GROO-bee&quot; ) is a village in the Hinckley and Bosworth borough Leicestershire, England. It is to the north west of Leicester. The population at the time of the 2011 census was 6,796.

The village saw a huge expansion during the 1970s along with the village of Glenfield. The historic village centre retains some of its historic buildings, cobbled lanes and thatched cottages. The church of St Philip and St James, built in the lancet style by George Harry Booth-Grey, the sixth Earl of Stamford, dates from 1840 and stands in the grounds of Groby Castle. The architect was William Railton. Additionally the village was also home to the former Groby Old Hall, the stone-built parts of which are thought to have been part of the castle&#x27;s outer buildings.

==History==
Groby was mentioned in Domesday Book of 1086, when it was described as having &quot;land for 4 ploughs, 10 villagers with 1 Freeman and 5 smallholders have 3 ploughs...the value was 20s; now 60s.&quot; Ulf is shown as the lord of Markfield, Groby, Blaby and Ratby in the hundred of Guthlaxton in Leicestershire in 1066. By 1086, the lord was Hugh de Grandmesnil who was also associated with the hundreds of Goscote, Guthlaxton and Gartree in Leicestershire. The estate was held by the Ferrers family until 1445 when it passed to the Grey family. By 1800 the village had expanded with the population reaching 250, and by 1920 it had reached 1,000. Employment in the village was largely in the local granite quarries and in farming. The seventh Earl of Stamford and 3rd Earl of Warrington employed the London architect Mr M.J. Dain of Dain and Parsons to design the Jacobean style mansion to replace the former hunting lodge the Grey family used at Groby when they were hunting in Leicestershire, this mansion was built by the local builder of Groby Mr Thomas Rudkin, Bradgate House was completed in 1856 and built to the north-west of the village and referred to as the Calendar House because it had 365 windows, 52 rooms, and 12 main chimneys. The Earls niece Mrs Katherine Henrietta Venezia Grey sold the Leicestershire estates in 1925, she inherited these in 1905, including Bradgate House, which was demolished (although the ruins of its extravagant stable block remain), from which many villagers bought their homes. Plots of land in the area were subsequently sold to builders, leading to a significant expansion of the village.

Historically, the village is noted for its connection with two Queens of England. Groby Old Hall, built in the 15th century, was owned by the Grey family whose estate included Bradgate Park. Sir John Grey of Groby married Elizabeth Woodville. After his death, in battle, she married Edward IV of England. Bradgate Park was the childhood home of Lady Jane Grey, who became Queen of England for nine days in 1553. The Grey family held the barony until it was forfeited in 1554. Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby became MP for Leicester in 1641 and fought on the side of Parliament in the English Civil War. In 1649 Grey was the only aristocrat of the 59 signatories of the death warrant of Charles I.

There is no definitive explanation of the roots of the village&#x27;s name, but its &#x27;-by&#x27; ending implies a link to Viking rule during the period of the Danelaw. Also, groo is a Viking word for pit, which may well refer to the quarry situated next to the village. The Domesday entry lists the village as &#x27;Grobi&#x27;. The &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names&quot; also shows the names &quot;Groubi&quot; or &quot;Groebi&quot; in the 12th century. Furthermore, it suggests the name is from a &quot;tarn&quot; perhaps with the Old Scandinavian name &quot;grōf&quot;; and that the Old Norse &quot;gróf&quot; means &quot;a torrent and a gully formed by it.&quot; The dictionary also says, &quot;It is identical with [ Gothic language ] &quot;gróba&quot;, [ Old High German ] &quot;grouba&quot; &#x27;pit, hollow&#x27;.&quot;

==Education==
There are four schools, Lady Jane Grey Primary, Elizabeth Woodville Primary and Martinshaw County Primary, whilst Brookvale Groby Learning Campus is located on a campus to the west of the village, and attracts students from Groby and surrounding villages including Ratby, Kirby Muxloe, Glenfield, and sometimes Markfield and New Parks. There is also a Scout troop based on the edge of Martinshaw Woods.

==Industry==
The old quarry in the village centre is now an industrial estate - mostly owned by the company GE Sensing formerly Druck Ltd, which makes pressure transducers.

Groby Quarry is located on the narrow lane which leads through to Newtown Linford, and is still used to quarry granite.

==Groby Pool==

Groby Pool, &quot;reputedly the largest natural expanse of open water in Leicestershire&quot; is a lake located opposite the quarry on Newtown Linford Lane. It is owned by Hanson quarries and managed by English Nature and became an SSSI in 1956. Due to lack of drainage, &quot;it is one of the most significant wildlife areas in Leicestershire.&quot; The origins of the pool are debated. Theories include that it resulted from the damming of Slate Brook by monks from Leicester Abbey or that it was a Roman clay-pit for pottery production. 
There is a public car park a few minutes&#x27; walk to the southeast, and it is possible to walk along the east side nearest the lane, although access elsewhere is restricted. Visitors are requested NOT to feed the birds as it changes the water balance and damages wildlife. The pool has a strict no fishing rule. In 2017, a number of notices were erected around the pool perimeter advising visitors NOT to paddle or swim due to blue green algae.

<text>The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC; ) is a private nonprofit organization that represents Canada at the International Olympic Committee. It is also a member of the Pan American Sports Organization.

==History==
Canadian athletes first competed at the Olympic Games at Paris 1900 followed by St. Louis 1904, it was not until 1907 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially recognized a National Olympic Committee (NOC) for Canada. The next year, Colonel John Hanbury-Williams was recognized as the chairman of the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) for the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. Hanbury-Williams became Canada&#x27;s first IOC member in 1911.

The COC was established to select athletes for the 1908 Summer Olympics, when the Canadian Amateur Athletic Union and the Amateur Athletic Federation of Canada had unsettled differences. J. Howard Crocker was appointed manager of the national team for Canada at the 1908 Summer Olympics, which was first national team organized.

After another Canadian Olympic Committee was created with the purpose of organizing a team for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, it was reported that the IOC wanted permanent NOCs. In 1913, the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU of C) created the Canadian Olympic Association with James Merrick as chairman, a position he held until 1921 when he succeeded Hanbury-Williams as IOC member.

At the 1922 AAU of C general meeting, J. Howard Crocker motioned to establish a standing COC, instead of forming a temporary committee prior to each Olympic Games. The permanent COC was to collaborate with provincial organizations to secure funding, chose athletes to represent Canada, and oversee travel and accommodations for the athletes. Patrick J. Mulqueen was elected president, while Crocker served as the secretary, and Fred Marples as the treasurer. During early years of fundraising, Marples felt that it was the duty of all Canadian citizens to ensure the strongest possible national team was sent the Olympics, and urged contributions from individuals, organizations, and provincial governments.

The COC asked athletic clubs across Canada to arrange competitions to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, using the events as trials for the national championships in Toronto in August 1927, and as a selection process of athletes for Canada at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

In November 1936, the AAU of C discussed multiple resolutions for reorganizing the COC. After Crocker and Mulqueen motioned to dissolve the current COC, the AAU of C agreed to establish a special committee to prepare for the next Olympic Games, including the president, secretary, one representative from each AAU of C branch, and one representative from each allied sports governing body in Canada.

In 1937, the organization was renamed the Canadian Olympic Association (COA), but remained within the AAU of C. In 1948, the COC executive was enlarged to have representation from all provinces in Canada. The Canadian Olympic Association replaced the COC by 1952, as a body independent of the AAU of C.

Team Canada has competed at every edition of the Games of the Olympiad since then, with the exception of 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Team Canada has competed at every edition of the Winter Olympic Games, beginning with the first at 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix. Team Canada has participated at every edition of the Youth Olympic Games, beginning with the first at 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore. Team Canada has competed at every edition of the Pan American Games, with the exception of the first at Buenos Aires 1951 because, at the time, countries of the Commonwealth did not participate in the Pan American Sports Congress.
In April 2002, the organization was once again renamed the Canadian Olympic Committee, bringing it in line with most other NOCs and making the acronym the same in English and French.

On May 29, 2009, the COC and Barbados Olympic Association signed a memorandum of understanding for co-operation between both bodies. Under the deal, the president of the Canadian Olympic Committee remarked that &quot;Signing this Memorandum of Understanding helps us work even more closely with our colleagues in Barbados to improve sport development for both Barbadian and Canadian athletes and coaches&quot;.

The deal covers a pledge of both national Olympic committees to develop stronger partnerships between sport federations of Canada and Barbados with athlete development an area of focus. This includes the free exchange of coaches, officials, trainers, judges, experts and scientists for participation in seminars, courses and counselling.

In December 2014, the COC partnered with Egale Canada and the international You Can Play foundation, announcing a program to combat homophobia in sport by addressing LGBT issues as part of its mandate.

<doc id="939401" wikidata="Q1122212" url="?curid=939401" title="Pauraque">
<text>The pauraque (Nyctidromus albicollis) – also called the common pauraque to distinguish it from similar species – is a nightjar species, one of two birds in the genus &quot;Nyctidromus&quot;. It breeds in the subtropical and tropical regions of the New World, and except for northernmost birds it is largely resident all year round.

==Taxonomy==
The pauraque was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other nightjars in the genus &quot;Caprimulgus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Caprimulgus albicollis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;white-throated goatsucker&quot; that had been described in 1783 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had examined a preserved specimen in London that was thought to have come from Cayenne, French Guiana. The pauraque is now placed with Anthony&#x27;s nightjar in the genus &quot;Nyctidromus&quot; that was introduced in 1838 by the English ornithologist John Gould. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;nukti-&quot; meaning &quot;nocturnal&quot; or &quot;night-&quot; with &quot;-dromos&quot; meaning &quot;-racer&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;albicollis&quot; combines the Latin &quot;albus&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot; with the Modern Latin &quot;-collis&quot; meaning &quot;-necked&quot;.

The common name &quot;pauraque&quot; may be an onomatopoeia from the bird&#x27;s wailing call.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;N. a. insularis&quot; Nelson, 1898 – Tres Marías Is. (off w Mexico)
* &quot;N. a. merrilli&quot; Sennett, 1888 – south Texas (USA) and northeast Mexico
* &quot;N. a. yucatanensis&quot; Nelson, 1901 – west, east Mexico (including Yucatán Peninsula) to central Guatemala
* &quot;N. a. gilvus&quot; Bangs, 1902 – central, east Panama and north Colombia
* &quot;N. a. albicollis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – south Guatemala to northwest Peru; east Colombia, northwest Peru and Venezuela through the Guianas and Brazil
* &quot;N. a. derbyanus&quot; Gould, 1838 – Bolivia, central, south Brazil, Paraguay and northeast Argentina
==Description==

This medium-sized nightjar is long and has two colour morphs, the plumage being variegated greyish-brown or rufous-brown. It is long-tailed and has broad rounded wings. The buff &#x27;eye-ring&#x27; and &#x27;facial stripe&#x27; contrast with the reddish sides of the face.

The adult male pauraque has a white band near the wing tips, and the outer tail feathers are mainly white. The female&#x27;s wing band is narrower and the white in the outer tail is more restricted. There are seven subspecies of the pauraque, differing in size and greyness.

The male pauraque&#x27;s song is very variable, but includes a whistled &quot;weeeow wheeooo&quot; (&quot;who-r-you&quot;), soft &quot;puk puk&quot; and a &quot;whip&quot; given in the courtship flight as he flutters around the female. Her call is a rapid succession of &quot;whip&quot; sounds.

==Distribution and ecology==

The breeding range of the common pauraque extends from southern Texas to the lower Paraná River region. Most populations are all-year residents, although the U.S. breeders (&quot;N. a. merrilli&quot;) may winter in eastern Mexico.

At the southern end of its range, subspecies &quot;N. a. derbyanus&quot; ranges from central and southern Brazil into the adjacent parts of Bolivia, and through Paraguay into Argentina and Uruguay. Even the southernmost birds seem to be nonmigratory, but at the limit of its range the species is only patchily distributed. For example, it is not recorded to breed in Entre Ríos Province (Argentina) and it is scarce in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil); about its presence in Uruguay likewise little is known, except that a population of some size is found along the Yaguarón River in the Cuchilla de Mangrullo region.
It is found in open woodland/grassland habitats, but also scrubland and crop fields. This species has long legs (by nightjar standards) with bare tarsi, and is more terrestrial than most of its relatives. If disturbed, it will sometimes run rather than fly, and it frequently rests on roads and tracks. In general, it prefers mixed habitat which offers densely vegetated hiding places – ideally forest – for the day, as well as open landscape – perhaps even rivers or wetlands – to hunt at night. The pauraque is nocturnal, like other nightjars, and starts to fly at dusk. Like its relatives, it feeds on insects caught in flight, usually by flycatching from a low perch, but also by foraging over open ground.

No nest is made; the two elongated and elliptical pinkish eggs are placed upon the bare ground or leaf litter. Sometimes just one egg is laid. 
Not globally threatened, it is considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. Being an adaptable species that will tolerate human disturbance of habitat well, the pauraque has actually benefitted from limited deforestation. Logging creates areas of low and secondary growth in which the birds are able to hunt more efficiently. However, it will of course abandon heavily built-up or clear-cut locales, and, in addition, it is very vulnerable to predation by feral dogs and cats, disappearing from areas where these pests are abundant.

<text>Nyctidromus is a genus of nightjars in the family Caprimulgidae. The species are widely distributed in Central and South America.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Nyctidromus&quot; was introduced in 1838 by the English ornithologist John Gould to accommodate his newly described &quot;Nyctidromus derbyanus&quot;. This taxon is therefore the type species; it is now considered as a subspecies of the pauraque, &quot;Nyctidromus albicollis&quot; (Gmelin) 1789. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;nukti-&quot; meaning &quot;nocturnal&quot; or &quot;night-&quot; with &quot;-dromos&quot; meaning &quot;-racer&quot; (from &quot;trekhō&quot; &quot;to run&quot;).

The genus contains two species:

* Pauraque, &quot;Nyctidromus albicollis&quot;
* Anthony&#x27;s nightjar, &quot;Nyctidromus anthonyi&quot;

<text>John Page (April 28, 1743October 11, 1808) was an American politician. He served in the U.S. Congress and as the 13th Governor of Virginia.

==Early life ==

Page was born and lived at Rosewell Plantation in Gloucester County. He was the son of Alice (Grymes) and Mann Page. His great-great-grandfather was Colonel John Page (1628–1692), an English merchant from Middlesex who emigrated to Virginia with his wife Alice Lucken Page and settled in Middle Plantation. He was the brother of Mann Page III.

John Page graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1763, where he was a close friend and college classmate of Thomas Jefferson, with whom he exchanged, as fellow revolutionaries, much correspondence.

==Career==
===Officer===

After he graduated from William and Mary, he then served under George Washington in an expedition during the French and Indian War. He also served during the American Revolutionary War as an officer in the Virginia state militia, raising a regiment from Gloucester County and supplementing it with personal funds. During that war, he attained the rank of colonel.

===Planter===
Page inherited wealth, including Rosewell plantation, but lacked business success as a planter, so after his death, when his debts became due, his family was forced to sell the plantation 

===Politician===
Page was a Fifth Virginia Convention delegate in 1776. Page was also instrumental in getting his wife Frances&#x27; brother, Nathaniel Burwell, appointed to the Governor&#x27;s council, and together, Page and Burwell opposed Lord Dunmore&#x27;s proclamation against Patrick Henry. Page and Burwell built the council whose membership read like a list of Patriots, shaping the American Revolution against Britain.

The revolutionary Virginia legislature elected Page as the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and served 1776–1779. Gloucester County voters elected him and Thomas Smith as their representatives in the new Virginia House of Delegates 1781–1783 and re=elected the pair three times to the one-year, part-time position until electing James Hubard to replace Page in 1784, only to reelect Page with Smith&#x27;s namesake son, who served 1785 – 1788. However, when voters were asked to select delegates to the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, they chose Warner Lewis alongside Thomas Smith, rather than this man. Nonetheless, the Page family remained politically powerful in Gloucester County, as voters elected Mann Page to succeed him for a term. However, they selected Mordecai Cooke and James Baytop, who became their repeatedly reelected delegates in Richmond.

Following ratification of the federal constitution, Page successfully ran for a seat in the First United States Congress and was reelected to the Second and Third, and to the Fourth as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party after that party had been created by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. He was a Congressman from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1797. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1792.

After his terms in Congress, Page again won election as one of Gloucester County&#x27;s representatives to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1797, alongside William Hall. However, only Hall won re-election in 1798, as Mordecai Cooke and several other men won the second seat. In 1797, Page was the Democratic-Republican nominee for governor of Virginia, and he was one of two major candidates in the 1799 U.S. Senate special election, in which he was defeated by fellow Democratic-Republican Wilson Cary Nicholas. In 1800, Gloucester County voters again selected Page to sit alongside Hall and reelected neither, presumably in part because fellow legislators elected Page as Governor of Virginia. He also tried to return to Congress in 1801, but was defeated by Federalist nominee and former state delegate John Stratton.

Page became the Governor of Virginia in 1802 and served until 1805. After his term ended (since the state constitution forbade re-election), Page accepted a federal appointment as United States commissioner of loans for Virginia and held office until his death.

==Personal life==

In 1765, Page married Frances Burwell, daughter of Col. Robert &quot;Robin&quot; Burwell. Together, Frances and John were the parents of twelve children, though only seven lived to adulthood: Mann (1766–1813), Robert (1770-?), Sally (1771-?), Alice (1775-?), Frances (1777-?), Francis (1781-?), and Judith (1783-?). Of the seven who survived to adulthood, five married children of Gov. Thomas Nelson, thereby forging a significant alliance between the Page and Nelson families; there was also Burwell blood on both sides, the Burwells by these marriages becoming close relatives of the Page and Nelson families for at least three generations.

After the death of his first wife in 1784, Page remarried, this time to early American poet Margaret Lowther Page, who hosted a literary salon at the Rosewell Plantation. Page, himself also a poet, wrote several poems about national political issues, including Shays&#x27; Rebellion and the Virginia Religious Disestablishment Act (Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom). He and Margaret were parents to eight children. However, only three lived to see adulthood: Margaret (1790-?), Barbara(1795-?), and Lucy (1807-?). Page&#x27;s niece by marriage, Judith Lomax, was also a poet.

Page died in Richmond, Virginia, on October 11, 1808. He was interred in St. John&#x27;s Churchyard in Richmond.

===Legacy===
The Page family is one of the First Families of Virginia. Its members include Colonel John Page, Governor John Page, his brother Mann Page, Thomas Nelson Page a leading proponent of the Lost Cause myth, and Virginian Railway builder William Nelson Page.

Page County, Virginia, located in the Shenandoah Valley, was formed in 1831 and named for Governor John Page. Also bearing his name is a residence hall at the College of William and Mary.

Governor Page was quoted by George W. Bush in his inaugural address in 2001. Writing to his friend Jefferson shortly after the Declaration of Independence was published, Page said of the Declaration and the Revolution: &quot;We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm&quot;.

==Electoral history==

*1789; Page was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, defeating Spencer Roane and Meriwether Smith
*1790; Page was re-elected unopposed.

<text>Douglas Lawrence Osowski (born January 1, 1969), known professionally as Mr. Lawrence, is an American voice actor, animator, comedian, and writer. He is best known for his work as a writer and voice actor for the Nicktoons &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. On &quot;SpongeBob&quot;, he has provided the voice of Sheldon J. Plankton, Larry the Lobster, Fred, and various recurring characters since the show&#x27;s debut in 1999.

==Early life and career==
Lawrence grew up in East Brunswick, New Jersey. In high school, he would appear in sketch comedy live shows during the summer. He attended The Kubert School for two years, before dropping out to focus on his stand-up.

Lawrence started his animation career at Spümcø, where he was one of the few new hires alongside Peter Avanzino and Ron Hughart. He served as a layout assistant on the second season of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; and endured harsh working conditions under John Kricfalusi. He followed future showrunner Bob Camp and others to Games Animation, where he completed the rest of his work and switched to Joe Murray&#x27;s unit. He became a major crew member on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, voicing Filburt while directing and writing multiple episodes, a contrast to his minor role at the perpetually suffering &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; unit.

After &quot;Rocko&quot;, he worked as a writer (and, since season 10, story editor) on the animated TV series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. He also has long-running character roles on the show, providing the voice of Sheldon Plankton and various recurring characters, such as Potty the Parrot (replacing Paul Tibbitt from season 10 onwards), the Realistic Fish-Head, and Larry the Lobster.

He was the voice of Edward T. Platypus, Nurse Leslie, Dave, and Ping-Pong on &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;. Lawrence also performed the voice of Manant in &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;. Lawrence also worked as a producer on the television series &quot;Johnny Talk&quot; and as a writer on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, &quot;The Twisted Whiskers Show&quot; and &quot;Mighty Magiswords&quot;.

As a comedian, Lawrence performed in New Jersey and Los Angeles, collaborating with comedian Jeremy Kramer and Boston comedy writer Martin Olson. Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, a storyboard writer for &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; and co-creator of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, described Lawrence as bearing a &quot;unique sense of humor&quot;, and that one &quot;would really have to know Doug to understand (or not understand)&quot; his style. Marsh says that the rationale for Lawrence&#x27;s humor techniques and decisions &quot;remain a mystery to us forever.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lawrence is married and lives in Burbank, California.

<doc id="939430" wikidata="Q373909" url="?curid=939430" title="Deir el-Bahari">
<text>Deir el-Bahari or Dayr al-Bahri (, , ) is a complex of mortuary temples and tombs located on the west bank of the Nile, opposite the city of Luxor, Egypt. This is a part of the Theban Necropolis.

The first monument built at the site was the mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II of the Eleventh Dynasty. It was constructed during the 21st century BC.

During the Eighteenth Dynasty, Amenhotep I and Hatshepsut also built extensively at the site.

==Mortuary temple of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep==

Mentuhotep II, the Eleventh Dynasty king who reunited Egypt at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, built a very unusual funerary complex. His mortuary temple was built on several levels in the great bay at Deir el-Bahari. It was approached by a causeway leading from a valley temple which no longer exists.

The mortuary temple itself consists of a forecourt and entrance gate, enclosed by walls on three sides, and a terrace on which stands a large square structure that may represent the primeval mound that arose from the waters of chaos. As the temple faces east, the structure is likely to be connected with the sun cult of Ra and the resurrection of the king.

From the eastern part of the forecourt, an opening called the Bab el-Hosan (&#x27;Gate of the Horseman&#x27;) leads to an underground passage and an unfinished tomb or cenotaph containing a seated statue of the king. On the western side, tamarisk and sycamore trees were planted beside the ramp leading up to the terrace. At the back of the forecourt and terrace are colonnades decorated in relief with boat processions, hunts, and scenes showing the king&#x27;s military achievements.

Statues of the Twelfth Dynasty king Senusret III were found here too.

The inner part of the temple was actually cut into the cliff and consists of a peristyle court, a hypostyle hall and an underground passage leading into the tomb itself. The cult of the dead king centred on the small shrine cut into the rear of the Hypostyle Hall.

The mastaba-like structure on the terrace is surrounded by a pillared ambulatory along the west wall, where the statue shrines and tombs of several royal wives and daughters were found. These royal princesses were the priestesses of Hathor, one of the main ancient Egyptian funerary deities. Although little remained of the king&#x27;s own burial, six sarcophagi were retrieved from the tombs of the royal ladies (Ashayet, Henhenet, Kawit, Kemsit, Muyet and Sadhe). Each was formed of six slabs, held together at the corners by metal braces and carved in sunken relief. The sarcophagus of Queen Kawit, now in the Cairo Museum, is particularly fine.

The burial shaft and subsequent tunnel descend for 150 meters and end in a burial chamber 45 meters below the court. The chamber held a shrine, which once held the wooden coffin of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep. A great tree-lined court was reached by means of the processional causeway, leading up from the valley temple. Beneath the court, a deep shaft was cut which led to unfinished rooms believed to have been intended originally as the king&#x27;s tomb. A wrapped image of the pharaoh was discovered in this area by Howard Carter. The temple complex also held six mortuary chapels and shaft tombs built for the pharaoh&#x27;s wives and daughters.

==Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut==


The focal point of the Deir el-Bahari complex is the &quot;Djeser-Djeseru&quot; meaning &quot;the Holy of Holies&quot;, the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. It is a colonnaded structure, which was designed and implemented by Senenmut, royal steward and architect of Hatshepsut, to serve for her posthumous worship and to honor the glory of Amun.

Djeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of colonnaded terraces, reached by long ramps that once were graced with gardens. It is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it, and is largely considered to be one of the &quot;incomparable monuments of ancient Egypt&quot;. It is tall.

The unusual form of Hatshepsut&#x27;s temple is explained by the choice of location, in the valley basin of Deir el-Bahari, surrounded by steep cliffs. It was here, in about 2050 BC, that Mentuhotep II, the founder of the Middle Kingdom, laid out his sloping, terrace-shaped mortuary temple. The pillared galleries at either side of the central ramp of the &quot;Djeser Djeseru&quot; correspond to the pillar positions on two successive levels of the Temple of Mentuhotep.

Today the terraces of Deir el-Bahari only convey a faint impression of the original intentions of Senenmut. Most of the statue ornaments are missing – the statues of Osiris in front of the pillars of the upper colonnade, the sphinx avenues in front of the court, and the standing, sitting, and kneeling figures of Hatshepsut; these were destroyed in a posthumous condemnation of this pharaoh. The architecture of the temple has been considerably altered as a result of misguided reconstruction in the early twentieth century AD.

===Architecture===

While Hatshepsut used Mentuhotep&#x27;s temple as a model, the two structures are significantly different. Hatshepsut employed a lengthy colonnaded terrace that deviated from the centralized massing of Mentuhotep&#x27;s model – an anomaly that may be caused by the decentralized location of her burial chamber.

There are three layered terraces reaching in height. Each &#x27;story&#x27; is articulated by a double colonnade of square piers, with the exception of the northwest corner of the central terrace, which employs Proto-Doric columns to house the chapel.
These terraces are connected by long ramps which were once surrounded by gardens. The layering of Hatshepsut&#x27;s temple corresponds with the classical Theban form, employing pylon, courts, hypostyle hall, sun court, chapel, and sanctuary.

The relief sculpture within Hatshepsut&#x27;s temple recites the tale of the divine birth of the pharaoh. The text and pictorial cycle also tell of an expedition to the Land of Punt, an exotic country on the Red Sea coast.

On either side of the entrance to the sanctuary &quot;(shown right)&quot; are painted pillars with images of Hathor as the capitals. Just under the roof is an image of Wadjet, displayed as a bilateral solar symbol, flanked by two other long serpents.

The temple includes an image, shown to the right, of Hatshepsut depicted as male pharaoh giving offerings to Horus, and to their left, an animal skin wound around a tall staff that is a symbol of the god Osiris.

While the statues and ornamentation have since been stolen or destroyed, the temple once was home to two statues of Osiris, a long avenue lined by sphinxes, as well as many sculptures of pharaoh Hatshepsut in different attitudes – standing, sitting, or kneeling.

==Mortuary temple of Thutmose III==

Thutmose III built a temple complex here, dedicated to Amun. Discovered in 1961, it is believed to have been used during the Beautiful Festival of the Valley. Not much is known about the complex, as it was abandoned after sustaining severe damage during a landslide in the latter Twentieth Dynasty. After that, it was used as a source of building materials and in Christian times became the site of a Coptic cemetery.

==Royal and non-royal tombs==

A tomb (TT320) in a hidden recess in the cliffs to the south of the temples contained a cache of forty royal mummies, moved there from the Valley of the Kings. The bodies had been placed there by Twenty-first Dynasty priests, most likely to prevent further desecration and looting. The tomb was probably originally built for priests of the 21st Dynasty, most likely the family of Pinedjem II. In the cache were found the mummies of Ahmose I, along with the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasty leaders Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX. In a separate room were found Twenty-first dynasty High Priests and pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. The discovery of the mummies cache is depicted in the Egyptian movie &quot;The Night of Counting the Years&quot; (1969).

In 1891, a larger cache of 153 reburied mummies of the priests themselves also were found in a tomb at the site, known today as Bab el-Gasus &#x27;Gate of the Priests&#x27; (also referred to as the &quot;Priestly Cache&quot; or &quot;Second Cache&quot;).

Private tombs dating from the Middle Kingdom through the Ptolemaic period are also situated here. There are two most notable private tombs at Deir el-Bahari. The first is that of Meketre (TT280), which contained many painted wooden funerary models from the Middle Kingdom and the first recorded human-headed canopic jar.

The second, the &quot;secret&quot; tomb of Senenmut – the architect and steward who oversaw the construction of the temple for Hatshepsut – was begun in the complex also. Senenmut&#x27;s tomb was vandalized in antiquity, but some of the relief artwork is still intact. It was meant to be a very large tomb and its corridors are over long. However, it was never finished and Senenmut was not interred there. He has another tomb, not far from Deir el-Bahari, where his body may have been placed, but it, too, was vandalized and robbed.

A large area of non-royal tombs in this vicinity is called Sheikh Abd el-Qurna.

== Stone chest ==
In March 2020 archeologists from Warsaw University&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology, led by Andrzej Niwiński, discovered a treasure chest and a wooden box dating back 3,500 years in the Egyptian site of Deir el-Bahari.

The stone chest contained several items, with all of them covered with linen canvas. Three bundles of flax were found during the excavation. A goose skeleton, sacrificed for religious purposes, was found inside one of them. The second one included goose eggs. It is believed that what the third bundle contained was an ibis egg, which had a symbolic meaning for the ancient Egyptians. In addition, a little wooden trinket box was discovered inside the bundle; the box is believed to contain the name Pharaoh Thutmose II.

According to the Andrzej Niwiński, &quot;The chest itself is about 40 cm long, with a slight smaller height. It was perfectly camouflaged, looked like an ordinary stone block. Only after a closer look did it turn out to be a chest.&quot;

==Terrorism==

In 1997, 58 tourists and four Egyptians were massacred at Hatshepsut&#x27;s mortuary temple by Islamist terrorists from Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya in what has been called the Luxor massacre, causing a reduction of tourism in the area.

== Art ==
&quot;Kaska, Dance of War&quot; is a painting by Shefa Salem that depicts Libyan soldiers performing a kaska dance of the Timihu people, which was first recorded 5000 years ago at Deir El-Bahari.

<text>The Lions Road is a section of the road running between the Summerland Way in New South Wales and the Mount Lindesay Highway near Rathdowney, Queensland at Running Creek. It joins two pre-existing sections of rural road, namely Gradys Creek Road in New South Wales and Running Creek Road in Queensland. It was so named as most of the funding, planning and voluntary labour for the road came from the Kyogle branch of the Lions Club. Kyogle resident Jack Hurley was one of the most prominent advocates of the road. Despite the NSW Government rejecting the idea in 1969, it was opened the following year.

It connects these two roads over the Richmond Gap in the McPherson Range. For a good deal of its length it is a narrow one-laned road that cannot be used by trucks or cars towing caravans or trailers. In the 1990s the road was fully sealed with bitumen but the original alignments were largely unaltered, leading to possible surprises for inexperienced drivers who allow themselves to build up excessive speed, particularly on steep mountainous stretches. On the NSW side there are many bridges over small creeks, with steep approaches. They were of wooden construction that could only support low vehicular weights, but almost all of them were replaced by concrete bridges in 2017–18. All the bridges on the Queensland side are concrete, but several of them are one-lane bridges on which vehicles travelling &#x27;upstream&#x27; must give way before entering the bridge.

In 2017, Kyogle Council started a major upgrade program where all but two of the narrow timber bridges were replaced by modern concrete bridges. The remaining timber bridges do not have the weight limitations required, and will be replaced at the end of their natural life.
The road was fully reopened in May 2018 following extended delays and closures.

The road runs through the Border Ranges National Park and it is altogether a scenic drive. The road also parallels the main Brisbane-Sydney railway line, including near a feature of the railway line known as the Cougal Spiral (or Border Loop). It passes adjacent to a small section of the Mount Chinghee National Park.

<text>The Just Desserts shooting was a notable crime that occurred in Toronto on the evening of Tuesday, April 5, 1994. Just after 11:00 PM, a group of three men barged into the Just Desserts Café, a popular café on Davenport Road in Toronto&#x27;s Yorkville neighbourhood. One of the men was armed with a shotgun. The armed robbers ordered the thirty staff and patrons to the back of the store and took their valuables.

One of the patrons that evening was 23-year-old hairdresser Georgina Leimonis (aka Vivi Leimonis) who was there with her boyfriend. A dispute broke out when two male patrons refused to hand over their wallets; they were punched by one of the robbers. Soon after, the man with the shotgun fired and hit Leimonis in the chest. The robbers fled the restaurant. Leimonis was rushed to hospital; after surgery she died at 2:45 on Wednesday morning.

==Investigation==
A security camera in the restaurant filmed the entire scene, but its low quality and lack of audio made it difficult to make out events and hard to identify the murderers. The police began a search for four men, the three who had been involved in the robbery and another who had helped them case the restaurant earlier. The police were criticized when the descriptions released of the four men was that they were 6-foot-tall black men. Many felt that such a vague description would do nothing to help capture the perpetrators and would merely enhance stereotypes of black men being criminals.

A week after the shooting Lawrence Augustus Brown was identified as a suspect and he turned himself in to police. Another of the three, O&#x27;Neil Rohan Grant, was arrested soon after. That fall, Gary George Francis and Emile Mark Jones were arrested. Grant, Francis, and Jones were charged with manslaughter and robbery. Brown, who had fired the shotgun, was charged with first-degree murder. The charges against Jones, who was not involved in the robbery itself, were later dropped.

==Consequences==
The shooting caused an unprecedented uproar in Toronto and Canada in general. While Canada had 596 murders in 1994, the crime occurred &quot;within minutes of virtually every national media outlet in the country,&quot; and the cold-blooded murder of a woman is rare. As a result, more than 3,000 people attended her funeral. The outcry led to a call for many political changes. Some called for a return of capital punishment, others for increased gun control.

When it was discovered that the attackers were Jamaican citizens, though they had arrived in Canada as children, editorials in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; and in other media outlets called for tougher immigration laws. New rules were brought in making it easier to deport non-citizens who committed crimes.

==Trial==
The already famous crime also became notable for being extensively mishandled. The move to trial was extremely slow, as the men sat in jail for years, being denied bail, but not being brought to trial. The case was marred by errors by police and prosecutors, but it was mainly lengthened by defence lawyers who were later accused of unprofessional conduct. While the new defence team argued the charges should be thrown out due to the long delay, this motion was rejected. By the time it came to trial, 40,000 pages of files related to the case had accumulated.

The trials finally got underway in May 1999, with Brown now acting as his own defence counsel. The trial itself became one of Canada&#x27;s longest, with Brown extensively cross-examining each witness, often for up to two days.

Allegations of racism and discrimination were levelled from the very beginning. One of the lawyers — there were dozens hired, fired and removed — likened the preferred indictment to &quot;the modern-day equivalent of a lynching.&quot; Moreover, in a letter written in 1995 to Ian Scott, then chief counsel for special investigations at the Crown Law Office, lawyers for the accused alleged that &quot;this case has drawn a tremendous amount of publicity . . . not because of the nature of the crime itself, but because the defendants are all black, Ms. Leimonis is white and the incident occurred in an upper-middle-class restaurant frequented primarily by white people.&quot;

A scathing 60-page summary ruling on the case by Mr. Justice Brian Trafford, puts the police and the justice system in an unenviable light. The selective use of leg irons, belly chains and handcuffs on the three suspects displayed &quot;cultural insensitivity towards black people,&quot; stated Judge Trafford. He also found that to this day Toronto police have &quot;never comprehensively investigated allegations of abuse.&quot; Activists, angry at the use of shackles, have brought up the spectre of the slave trade. They have pointed out that Paul Bernardo was never shackled in court.

===Verdict===
The case continued to attract widespread public interest. On the day after the trial closed on December 6, 1999, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; published an unprecedented six-page section devoted to the murder and trial. The verdict was finally released on December 11: Brown and Francis were found guilty, and Grant was acquitted. Brown was given a life sentence with no chance of parole for twenty-five years. Francis was given fifteen years, and seven were knocked off for the years in jail during the trial. He was thus eligible for parole only three years later, but his 2002 application was rejected. He was released on parole in 2005. On February 24, 2008, Francis was found in possession of 33 grams of crack cocaine and in May 2008 sentenced to 7½ months in jail for several drug related offences. Grant was deported from Canada to his native Jamaica where he was shot to death on October 29, 2007.

==Current tenants==
The infamous location at 306 Davenport Road was occupied by a Subway Restaurant franchise and is currently empty, with a proposal by Cityzen Development Group to build a condominium. Developers demolished the building in Spring 2022.

==Cultural impact==
The shooting inspired both Jerry Ciccoritti&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;The Life Before This&quot;, and the pilot episode of the Canadian television drama series &quot;The City&quot;.

<doc id="939449" wikidata="Q6820109" url="?curid=939449" title="Merrie Spaeth">
<text>Merrie Marcia Spaeth (born August 23, 1948) is an American public relations and communications consultant.

== Early life and education ==
Spaeth is the daughter of Dr. Philip G. Spaeth and Marcia Ryan Spaeth. She attended Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia. In 1970, Spaeth graduated with honors from Smith College and later earned an MBA from Columbia Business School, where she graduated &quot;cum laude&quot;.

== Career ==
At the age of 15 in 1964, Spaeth was cast to play Marian &quot;Gil&quot; Gilbert in &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot;.

Between 1970 and 1978, Spaeth wrote for numerous print publications and was a reporter for several local television stations. Additionally, Spaeth was a speechwriter for William S. Paley, founder and chairman of CBS. In 1978 Spaeth hosted and produced a nightly television show in Columbus, Ohio, for Warner-Amex Cable. In 1979, Spaeth was a producer for &quot;20/20,&quot; where she produced segments on Liberace, gifted children and motorcycle gangs.

In the early 1980s, Spaeth was accepted to the White House Fellows program where she was assigned to work under FBI Director William Webster as his special assistant, after which she worked for two years as director of public affairs for the Federal Trade Commission. In 1983, she became White House Director of Media Relations in the administration of Ronald Reagan, serving until 1985.

After moving to Dallas with her husband, Spaeth founded Spaeth Communications in 1987. Starting in the 1990s, Spaeth currently teaches BLC (business leadership center) seminar classes at the Cox School of Business at SMU. 

=== Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ===
During the 2004 presidential campaign, Spaeth advised the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group that questioned the Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry’s Vietnam War record. Since the 2004 election, the term &quot;Swift Boating&quot; (or &quot;swiftboating&quot;) has become a common expression for a campaign attacking opponents by questioning their credibility and patriotism in a dishonest manner. The term is most often used with the pejorative meaning of a smear campaign. Spaeth has referred to her involvement in this campaign as her “biggest regret.”

=== Work with Ken Starr ===
Spaeth was hired as a communications consultant to Ken Starr, an attorney who served as Solicitor General of the United States under George H. W. Bush and Special prosecutor for the Whitewater controversy during the Clinton Administration. Starr was then serving as President of Baylor University during the Baylor University sexual assault scandal. As president, Starr had received email messages from a female student who claimed that she had been raped, though he later denied receiving the messages. In a television interview with KWTX-TV, Spaeth was present and periodically stopped the interview to coach Starr on his answers about the controversy.

== Publications ==
Spaeth contributed to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity from 2006 to 2010 writing columns on executive communication. Additionally, Spaeth has written for &quot;HR Executive, PRWeek, Bank Marketing, Public Diplomacy, Modern Healthcare, PRSA Strategist&quot;, and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. She has written three books: &quot;Marketplace Communication&quot;, &quot;Words Matter&quot;, and &quot;You Don’t Say!&quot;

== Personal life ==
Spaeth was previously married to Robert S. Thanhauser Jr. In 1984, she married &quot;Tex&quot; Lezar, who served as a counselor to William French Smith and later as United States Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy. They have three children. Lezar died on January 5, 2004. Spaeth is a Republican.

<doc id="939450" wikidata="Q3051631" url="?curid=939450" title="Mark Kurlansky">
<text>Mark Kurlansky (December 7, 1948) is an American journalist and author who has written a number of books of fiction and nonfiction. His 1997 book, &quot;Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World&quot; (1997), was an international bestseller and was translated into more than fifteen languages. His book &quot;&quot; (2006) was the nonfiction winner of the 2007 Dayton Literary Peace Prize.

==Life and work==
Kurlansky was born in Hartford, Connecticut on December 7, 1948. He attended Butler University, where he earned a BA in 1970. He started his career as a playwright. He was a theatre major at college and wrote seven or eight plays, a few of which were produced. But he said that he became &quot;frustrated with theatre, which is to say I became frustrated with Broadway&quot;. 

From 1976 to 1991, he worked as a correspondent in Western Europe for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and eventually the Paris-based &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. He moved to Mexico in 1982, where he continued to practice journalism. In 2007, he was named the Baruch College Harman writer-in-residence.

Kurlansky wrote his first book, &quot;A Continent of Islands&quot;, in 1992 and went on to write several more throughout the 1990s. His third work of nonfiction, &quot;Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World&quot;, won the 1998 James Beard Award. It became an international bestseller and was translated into more than 15 languages. His work and contribution to Basque identity and culture was recognized in 2001 when the Society of Basque Studies in America named him to the Basque Hall of Fame. That same year, he was awarded an honorary ambassadorship from the Basque government.

As a teenager, Kurlansky called Émile Zola his &quot;hero&quot;, and in 2009, he translated one of Zola&#x27;s novels, &quot;The Belly of Paris&quot;, whose theme is the food markets of Paris.

Kurlansky&#x27;s 2009 book, &quot;The Food of a Younger Land&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;A portrait of American food – before the national highway system, before chain restaurants, and before frozen food, when the nation&#x27;s food was seasonal, regional, and traditional – from the lost WPA files&quot;, details American foodways in the early 20th century.

<doc id="939453" wikidata="Q1049476" url="?curid=939453" title="Constructor (object-oriented programming)">
<text>In class-based, object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) is a special type of function called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.

A constructor resembles an instance method, but it differs from a method in that it has no explicit return type, it is not implicitly inherited and it usually has different rules for scope modifiers. Constructors often have the same name as the declaring class. They have the task of initializing the object&#x27;s data members and of establishing the invariant of the class, failing if the invariant is invalid. A properly written constructor leaves the resulting object in a &quot;valid&quot; state. Immutable objects must be initialized in a constructor.

Most languages allow overloading the constructor in that there can be more than one constructor for a class, with differing parameters. Some languages take consideration of some special types of constructors. Constructors, which concretely use a single class to create objects and return a new instance of the class, are abstracted by factories, which also create objects but can do so in various ways, using multiple classes or different allocation schemes such as an object pool.

== Types ==
=== Parameterized constructors ===
Constructors that can take at least one argument are termed as parameterized constructors. When an object is declared in a parameterized constructor, the initial values have to be passed as arguments to the constructor function. The normal way of object declaration may not work. The constructors can be called explicitly or implicitly. The method of calling the constructor implicitly is also called the shorthand method.
class Example {
 public:
 Example();
 Example(int a, int b); // Parameterized constructor.

 private:
 int x_;
 int y_;

Example::Example() = default;

Example::Example(int x, int y) : x_(x), y_(y) {}

Example e = Example(0, 50); // Explicit call.
Example e2(0, 50); // Implicit call.
=== Default constructors ===
If the programmer does not supply a constructor for an instantiable class, Java compiler inserts a default constructor into your code on your behalf. This constructor is known as default constructor. You would not find it in your source code (the java file) as it would be inserted into the code during compilation and exists in .class file. The behavior of the default constructor is language dependent. It may initialize data members to zero or other same values, or it may do nothing at all. In Java, a &quot;default constructor&quot; refer to a nullary constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler if no constructors have been defined for the class or in the absence of any programmer-defined constructors (e.g. in Java, the default constructor implicitly calls the superclass&#x27;s nullary constructor, then executes an empty body). All fields are left at their initial value of 0 (integer types), 0.0 (floating-point types), false (boolean type), or null (reference types)...
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Student {
 public:
 Student(int a = 0, int b = 0); // Default constructor.

 int a;
 int b;


=== Copy constructors ===

Like C++, Java also supports &quot;Copy Constructor&quot;. But, unlike C++, Java doesn&#x27;t create a default copy constructor if you don&#x27;t write your own. Copy constructors define the actions performed by the compiler when copying class objects. A Copy constructor has one formal parameter that is the type of the class (the parameter may be a reference to an object). It is used to create a copy of an existing object of the same class. Even though both classes are the same, it counts as a conversion constructor.
While copy constructors are usually abbreviated copy ctor or cctor, they have nothing to do with class constructors used in .NET using the same abbreviation.

=== Conversion constructors ===
Conversion constructors provide a means for a compiler to implicitly create an object belonging to one class based on an object of a different type. These constructors are usually invoked implicitly to convert arguments or operands to an appropriate type, but they may also be called explicitly.

=== Move constructors ===
In C++, move constructors take an Rvalue reference to an object of the class, and are used to implement ownership transfer of the parameter object&#x27;s resources.

== Syntax ==
* Java, C++, C#, ActionScript, and MATLAB have a naming convention in which constructors have the same name as the class with which they are associated.
* In PHP 5, a recommended name for a constructor is codice_1. For backwards compatibility, a method with the same name as the class will be called if codice_1 method can not be found. Since PHP 5.3.3, this works only for non-namespaced classes.
* In PHP 7, you should always name the constructor as codice_1. Methods with the same name as the class will trigger an E_DEPRECATED level error.
* In Perl, constructors are, by convention, named &quot;new&quot; and have to do a fair amount of object creation.
* In Moose object system for Perl, constructors (named &quot;new&quot;) are automatically created and are extended by specifying a &quot;BUILD&quot; method.
* In Visual Basic .NET, the constructor is called &quot;codice_4&quot;.
* In Python, the constructor is split over two methods, &quot;codice_5&quot; and &quot;codice_6&quot;. The codice_5 method is responsible for allocating memory for the instance, and receives the class as an argument (conventionally called &quot;codice_8&quot;). The codice_6 method (often called &quot;the initialiser&quot;) is passed the newly created instance as an argument (conventionally called &quot;codice_10&quot;).
* Object Pascal constructors are signified by the keyword &quot;codice_11&quot; and can have user-defined names (but are mostly called &quot;codice_12&quot;).
* In Objective-C, the constructor method is split across two methods, &quot;codice_13&quot; and &quot;codice_14&quot; with the codice_13 method setting aside (allocating) memory for an instance of the class, and the codice_14 method handling the bulk of initializing the instance. A call to the method &quot;codice_17&quot; invokes both the codice_13 and the codice_14 methods, for the class instance.

== Memory organization ==
In Java, C#, and VB .NET, the constructor creates reference type objects in a special memory structure called the
&quot;heap&quot;. Value types (such as int, double, etc.) are created in a sequential structure called the &quot;stack&quot;.
VB .NET and C# also allow the use of the &quot;new&quot; operator to create value type objects, but these value type objects are created on the stack regardless of whether the operator is used or not. 

In C++, objects are created on the stack when the constructor is invoked without the new operator, and created on the heap when the constructor is invoked with the new operator. Stack objects are deleted implicitly when they go out of scope, while heap objects must be deleted implicitly by a destructor or explicitly by using the &quot;delete&quot; operator.

== Language details ==
Constructors are implemented in different programming languages in various ways, including:

=== C++ ===
In C++, the name of the constructor is the name of the class. It returns nothing. It can have parameters like any member function. Constructor functions are usually declared in the public section, but can also be declared in the protected and private sections, if the user wants to restrict access to them.

The constructor has two parts. First is the initializer list which follows the parameter list and before the method body. It starts with a colon and entries are comma-separated. The initializer list is not required, but offers the opportunity to provide values for data members and avoid separate assignment statements. The initializer list is required if you have &quot;const&quot; or reference type data members, or members that do not have parameterless constructor logic. Assignments occur according to the order in which data members are declared (even if the order in the initializer list is different). The second part is the body, which is a normal method body enclosed in curly brackets.

C++ allows more than one constructor. The other constructors must have different parameters. Additionally constructors which contain parameters which are given default values, must adhere to the restriction that not all parameters are given a default value. This is a situation which only matters if there is a default constructor. The constructor of a base class (or base classes) can also be called by a derived class. Constructor functions are not inherited and their addresses cannot be referenced. When memory allocation is required, the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; operators are called implicitly.

A copy constructor has a parameter of the same type passed as &quot;const&quot; reference, for example &quot;Vector(const Vector&amp; rhs)&quot;. If it is not provided explicitly, the compiler uses the copy constructor for each member variable or simply copies values in case of primitive types. The default implementation is not efficient if the class has dynamically allocated members (or handles to other resources), because it can lead to double calls to &quot;delete&quot; (or double release of resources) upon destruction.
class Foobar {
 public:
 Foobar(double r = 1.0,
 double alpha = 0.0) // Constructor, parameters with default values.
 : x_(r * cos(alpha)) // &lt;- Initializer list
 y_ = r * sin(alpha); // &lt;- Normal assignment

 private:
 double x_;
 double y_;

Example invocations:

Foobar a,
 b(3),
 c(5, M_PI/4);
On returning objects from functions or passing objects by value, the objects copy constructor will be called implicitly, unless return value optimization applies.

C++ implicitly generates a default copy constructor which will call the copy constructors for all base classes and all member variables unless the programmer provides one, explicitly deletes the copy constructor (to prevent cloning) or one of the base classes or member variables copy constructor is deleted or not accessible (private). Most cases calling for a customized copy constructor (e.g. reference counting, deep copy of pointers) also require customizing the destructor and the copy assignment operator. This is commonly referred to as the Rule of three.

=== C# ===
Example C# constructor:
public class MyClass
 private int a;
 private string b;

 // Constructor
 public MyClass() : this(42, &quot;string&quot;)
 }

 // Overloading a constructor
 public MyClass(int a, string b)
 this.a = a;
 this.b = b;
}

// Code somewhere
// Instantiating an object with the constructor above
MyClass c = new MyClass(42, &quot;string&quot;);
==== C# static constructor ====
In C#, a &quot;static constructor&quot; is a static data initializer. Static constructors are also called &quot;class constructors&quot;. Since the actual method generated has the name &quot;.cctor&quot; they are often also called &quot;cctors&quot;.

Static constructors allow complex static variable initialization.
Static constructors are called implicitly when the class is first accessed. Any call to a class (static or constructor call), triggers the static constructor execution.
Static constructors are thread safe and implement a singleton pattern. When used in a generic programming class, static constructors are called at every new generic instantiation one per type. Static variables are instantiated as well.
public class MyClass
 private static int _A;

 // Normal constructor
 static MyClass()
 _A = 32;

 // Standard default constructor
 public MyClass()

}

// Code somewhere
// Instantiating an object with the constructor above
// right before the instantiation
// The variable static constructor is executed and _A is 32
MyClass c = new MyClass();
=== ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) ===
ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) uses a method named &#x27;codice_14&#x27; as a constructor method.

Cheese.cfc

component {
 // properties
 property name=&quot;cheeseName&quot;;

 // constructor
 function Cheese init( required string cheeseName ) {
 variables.cheeseName = arguments.cheeseName;
 return this;
}
Create instance of a cheese.

myCheese = new Cheese( &#x27;Cheddar&#x27; );
Since ColdFusion 10, CFML has also supported specifying the name of the constructor method:
component initmethod=&quot;Cheese&quot; {
 // properties
 property name=&quot;cheeseName&quot;;

 // constructor
 function Cheese Cheese( required string cheeseName ) {
 variables.cheeseName = arguments.cheeseName;
 return this;
}
=== Eiffel ===
In Eiffel, the routines which initialize new objects are called &quot;creation procedures&quot;. Creation procedures have the following traits:

* Creation procedures have no explicit return type (by definition of &quot;procedure&quot;).
* Creation procedures are named.
* Creation procedures are designated by name as creation procedures in the text of the class.
* Creation procedures can be explicitly invoked to re-initialize existing objects.
* Every effective (i.e., concrete or non-abstract) class must designate at least one creation procedure.
* Creation procedures must leave the newly initialized object in a state that satisfies the class invariant.

Although object creation involves some subtleties, the creation of an attribute with a typical declaration codice_21 as expressed in a creation instruction codice_22 consists of the following sequence of steps:

* Create a new direct instance of type codice_23.
* Execute the creation procedure codice_24 to the newly created instance.
* Attach the newly initialized object to the entity codice_25.

In the first snippet below, class codice_26 is defined. The procedure codice_24 is coded after the keyword codice_28.

The keyword codice_29 introduces a list of procedures which can be used to initialize instances. In this case the list includes codice_30, a procedure with an empty implementation inherited from class codice_31, and the codice_24 procedure coded within the class.
class
 POINT
create
 default_create, make

feature

 make (a_x_value: REAL; a_y_value: REAL)
 do
 x := a_x_value
 y := a_y_value
 end

 x: REAL
 -- X coordinate

 y: REAL
 -- Y coordinate


In the second snippet, a class which is a client to codice_26 has a declarations codice_34 and codice_35 of type codice_26.

In procedural code, codice_34 is created as the origin (0.0, 0.0). Because no creation procedure is specified, the procedure codice_30 inherited from class codice_31 is used. This line could have been coded codice_40 .
Only procedures named as creation procedures can be used in an instruction with the codice_29 keyword.
Next is a creation instruction for codice_35, providing initial values for the codice_35&#x27;s coordinates.
The third instruction makes an ordinary instance call to the codice_24 procedure to reinitialize the instance attached to codice_35 with different values.
 my_point_1: POINT
 my_point_2: POINT

 create my_point_1
 create my_point_2.make (3.0, 4.0)
 my_point_2.make (5.0, 8.0)


=== F# ===
In F#, a constructor can include any codice_46 or codice_47 statements defined in a class. codice_46 statements define private fields and codice_47 statements execute code. Additional constructors can be defined using the codice_17 keyword.
type MyClass(_a : int, _b : string) = class
 // Primary constructor
 let a = _a
 let b = _b
 do printfn &quot;a = %i, b = %s&quot; a b

 // Additional constructors
 new(_a : int) = MyClass(_a, &quot;&quot;) then
 printfn &quot;Integer parameter given&quot;

 new(_b : string) = MyClass(0, _b) then
 printfn &quot;String parameter given&quot;

 new() = MyClass(0, &quot;&quot;) then
 printfn &quot;No parameter given&quot;
end

// Code somewhere
// instantiating an object with the primary constructor
let c1 = new MyClass(42, &quot;string&quot;)

// instantiating an object with additional constructors
let c2 = new MyClass(42)
let c3 = new MyClass(&quot;string&quot;)
let c4 = MyClass() // &quot;new&quot; keyword is optional
=== Java ===
In Java, constructors differ from other methods in that:

* Constructors never have an explicit return type.
* Constructors cannot be directly invoked (the keyword “codice_17” invokes them).
* Constructors should not have non-access modifiers.

Java constructors perform the following tasks in the following order:

# Call the default constructor of the superclass if no constructor is defined.
# Initialize member variables to the specified values.
# Executes the body of the constructor.

Java permit users to call one constructor in another constructor using codice_52 keyword.
But codice_52 must be first statement. 
class Example
 Example() // Non-parameterized constructor
 this(1); // Calling of constructor
 System.out.println(&quot;0-arg-cons&quot;);
 Example(int a) // Parameterized constructor
 System.out.println(&quot;1-arg-cons&quot;);
}
public static void main(String[] args)
 Example e = new Example();


Java provides access to the superclass&#x27;s constructor through the codice_54 keyword.
public class Example
 // Definition of the constructor.
 public Example()
 this(1);

 // Overloading a constructor
 public Example(int input)
 data = input; // This is an assignment

 // Declaration of instance variable(s).
 private int data;

// Code somewhere else
// Instantiating an object with the above constructor
Example e = new Example(42);
A constructor taking zero number of arguments is called a &quot;no-arguments&quot; or &quot;no-arg&quot; constructor.

=== JavaScript ===
As of ES6, JavaScript has direct constructors like many other programming languages. They are written as such
class FooBar {
 constructor(baz) {
 this.baz = baz
}
This can be instantiated as such
const foo = new FooBar(&#x27;7&#x27;)
The equivalent of this before ES6, was creating a function that instantiates an object as such
function FooBar (baz) {
 this.baz = baz;


This is instantiated the same way as above.

=== Object Pascal ===
In Object Pascal, the constructor is similar to a factory method. The only syntactic difference to regular methods is the keyword codice_11 in front of the name (instead of codice_56 or codice_57). It can have any name, though the convention is to have codice_12 as prefix, such as in codice_59. Creating an instance of a class works like calling a static method of a class: codice_60.
program OopProgram;

type
 TPerson = class
 private
 FName: string;
 public
 property Name: string read FName;
 constructor Create(AName: string);
 end;

constructor TPerson.Create(AName: string);
begin
 FName := AName;
end;

var
 Person: TPerson;
begin
 Person := TPerson.Create(&#x27;Peter&#x27;); // allocates an instance of TPerson and then calls TPerson.Create with the parameter AName = &#x27;Peter&#x27;
end.
=== OCaml ===
In OCaml, there is one constructor. Parameters are defined right after the class name. They can be used to initialize instance variables and are accessible throughout the class. An anonymous hidden method called codice_61 allows to evaluate an expression immediately after the object has been built.
class person first_name last_name =
 object
 val full_name = first_name ^ &quot; &quot; ^ last_name

 initializer
 print_endline(&quot;Hello there, I am &quot; ^ full_name ^ &quot;.&quot;)

 method get_last_name = last_name
 end;;

let alonzo = new person &quot;Alonzo&quot; &quot;Church&quot; in (*Hello there, I am Alonzo Church.*)

print_endline alonzo#get_last_name (*Church*)
=== PHP ===
In PHP version 5 and above, the constructor is a method named codice_62 (notice that it&#x27;s a double underscore), which the keyword codice_17 automatically calls after creating the object. It is usually used to automatically perform initializations such as property initializations. Constructors can also accept arguments, in which case, when the codice_17 statement is written, you also need to send the constructor arguments for the parameters.
class Person
 private string $name;

 public function __construct(string $name): void
 $this-&gt;name = $name;

 public function getName(): string
 return $this-&gt;name;
}
In PHP, a class is only allowed to declare a maximum of one constructor method. Static methods, factory classes or optional constructor arguments are some ways to facilitate multiple ways to create objects of a PHP class.

=== Perl 5 ===
In Perl version 5, by default, constructors are factory methods, that is, methods that create and return the object, concretely meaning create and return a blessed reference. A typical object is a reference to a hash, though rarely references to other types are used too. By convention the only constructor is named &quot;new&quot;, though it is allowed to name it otherwise, or to have multiple constructors. For example, a Person class may have a constructor named &quot;new&quot;, and a constructor &quot;new_from_file&quot; which reads a file for Person attributes, and &quot;new_from_person&quot; which uses another Person object as a template.
package Person;
# In Perl constructors are named &#x27;new&#x27; by convention.
sub new {
 # Class name is implicitly passed in as 0th argument.
 my $class = shift;

 # Default attribute values, if you have any.
 my %defaults = ( foo =&gt; &quot;bar&quot; );

 # Initialize attributes as a combination of default values and arguments passed.
 my $self = { %defaults, @_ };

 # Check for required arguments, class invariant, etc.
 if ( not defined $self-&gt;{first_name} ) {
 die &quot;Mandatory attribute missing in Person-&gt;new(): first_name&quot;;
 if ( not defined $self-&gt;{last_name} ) {
 die &quot;Mandatory attribute missing in Person-&gt;new(): last_name&quot;;
 if ( defined $self-&gt;{age} and $self-&gt;{age} &lt; 18 ) {
 die &quot;Invalid attribute value in Person-&gt;new(): age &lt; 18&quot;;

 # Perl makes an object belong to a class by &#x27;bless&#x27;.
 bless $self, $class;
 return $self;
1;
==== Perl 5 with Moose ====
In the Moose object system for Perl, most of this boilerplate can be omitted, a default &quot;new&quot; is created, attributes can be specified, and whether they can be set, reset, or are required. In addition, any extra constructor functionality can be included in a &quot;BUILD&quot; method which the Moose generated constructor will call, after it has checked the arguments. A &quot;BUILDARGS&quot; method can be specified to handle constructor arguments not in hashref / key =&gt; value form.
package Person;
# enable Moose-style object construction
use Moose;

# first name ( a string) can only be set at construction time (&#x27;ro&#x27;)
has first_name =&gt; (is =&gt; &#x27;ro&#x27;, isa =&gt; &#x27;Str&#x27;, required =&gt; 1);
# last name ( a string) can only be set at construction time (&#x27;ro&#x27;)
has last_name =&gt; (is =&gt; &#x27;ro&#x27;, isa =&gt; &#x27;Str&#x27;, required =&gt; 1);
# age (Integer) can be modified after construction (&#x27;rw&#x27;), and is not required
# to be passed to be constructor. Also creates a &#x27;has_age&#x27; method which returns
# true if age has been set
has age =&gt; (is =&gt; &#x27;rw&#x27;, isa =&gt; &#x27;Int&#x27;, predicate =&gt; &#x27;has_age&#x27;);

# Check custom requirements
sub BUILD {
 my $self = shift;
 if ($self-&gt;has_age &amp;&amp; $self-&gt;age &lt; 18) { # no under 18s
 die &quot;No under-18 Persons&quot;;
}
1;
In both cases the Person class is instiated like this:

use Person;
my $p = Person-&gt;new( first_name =&gt; &#x27;Sam&#x27;, last_name =&gt; &#x27;Ashe&#x27;, age =&gt; 42 );
=== Python ===
In Python, constructors are defined by one or both of codice_5 and codice_6 methods. A new instance is created by calling the class as if it were a function, which calls the codice_5 and codice_6 methods. If a constructor method is not defined in the class, the next one found in the class&#x27;s Method Resolution Order will be called.

In the typical case, only the codice_6 method need be defined. (The most common exception is for immutable objects.)
»&gt; class ExampleClass:
... def __new__(cls, value):
... print(&quot;Creating new instance...&quot;)
... # Call the superclass constructor to create the instance.
... instance = super(ExampleClass, cls).__new__(cls)

Classes normally act as factories for new instances of themselves, that is, a class is a callable object (like a function), with the call being the constructor, and calling the class returns an instance of that class. However the codice_5 method is permitted to return something other than an instance of the class for specialised purposes. In that case, the codice_6 is not invoked.

=== Raku ===
In Raku, even more boilerplate can be omitted, given that a default &quot;new&quot; method is inherited, attributes can be specified, and whether they can be set, reset, or are required. In addition, any extra constructor functionality can be included in a &quot;BUILD&quot; method which will get called to allow for custom initialization. A &quot;TWEAK&quot; method can be specified to post-process any attributes already (implicitly) initialized.
class Person {
 has Str $.first-name is required; # First name (a string) can only be set at
 # construction time (the . means &quot;public&quot;).
 has Str $.last-name is required; # Last name (a string) can only be set at
 # construction time (a ! would mean &quot;private&quot;).
 has Int $.age is rw; # Age (an integer) can be modified after 
 # construction (&#x27;rw&#x27;), and is not required
 # during the object instantiation.
 # Create a &#x27;full-name&#x27; method which returns the person&#x27;s full name.
 # This method can be accessed outside the class.
 method full-name { $!first-name.tc ~ &quot; &quot; ~ $!last-name.tc }

 # Create a &#x27;has-age&#x27; method which returns true if age has been set.
 # This method is used only inside the class so it&#x27;s declared as &quot;private&quot;
 # by prepending its name with a !
 method !has-age { self.age.defined }
 # Check custom requirements
 method TWEAK {
 if self!has-age &amp;&amp; $!age &lt; 18 { # No under 18
 die &quot;No person under 18&quot;;
 }


The Person class is instantiated like this:

my $p0 = Person.new( first-name =&gt; &#x27;Sam&#x27;, last-name =&gt; &#x27;Ashe&#x27;, age =&gt; 42 );
my $p1 = Person.new( first-name =&gt; &#x27;grace&#x27;, last-name =&gt; &#x27;hopper&#x27; );
say $p1.full-name(); # OUTPUT: «Grace Hopper␤»
Alternatively, the named parameters can be specified using the colon-pair syntax in Perl 6:

my $p0 = Person.new( :first-name&lt;Sam&gt;, :last-name&lt;Ashe&gt;, :age(42) );
my $p1 = Person.new( :first-name&lt;Grace&gt;, :last-name&lt;Hopper&gt; );
And should you have set up variables with names identical to the named parameters, you can use a shortcut that will use the name of the variable for the named parameter:

my $first-name = &quot;Sam&quot;;
my $last-name = &quot;Ashe&quot;;
my $age = 42;
my $p0 = Person.new( :$first-name, :$last-name, :$age );
=== Ruby ===
In Ruby, constructors are created by defining a method called codice_72. This method is executed to initialize each new instance.

irb(main):001:0&gt; class ExampleClass
irb(main):002:1&gt; def initialize
irb(main):003:2&gt; puts &quot;Hello there&quot;
irb(main):004:2&gt; end
irb(main):005:1&gt; end
=&gt; nil
irb(main):006:0&gt; ExampleClass.new
Hello there
=&gt; #&lt;ExampleClass:0x007fb3f4299118&gt;
=== Visual Basic .NET ===
In Visual Basic .NET, constructors use a method declaration with the name &quot;codice_4&quot;.
Class Foobar
 Private strData As String

 &#x27; Constructor
 Public Sub New(ByVal someParam As String)
 strData = someParam
 End Sub
End Class

&#x27; code somewhere else
&#x27; instantiating an object with the above constructor
Dim foo As New Foobar(&quot;.NET&quot;)

<doc id="939459" wikidata="Q2091318" url="?curid=939459" title="Alessandro Valignano">
<text>Alessandro Valignano, S.J., sometimes Valignani (Chinese: 范禮安 &quot;Fàn Lǐ’ān&quot;; February 1539 – January 20, 1606), was an Italian Jesuit priest and missionary born in Chieti, part of the Kingdom of Naples, who helped supervise the introduction of Catholicism to the Far East, and especially to Japan.

== Education and commission ==
Valignano was born in Chieti, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, son of a Neapolitan aristocrat and friend of Pope Paul IV.

He excelled as a student at the University of Padua, where he first obtained his doctorate in law at the age of 19. After several years in Rome, he returned to Padua in 1562 to study Christian theology. After spending a year in gaol, he returned to Rome in 1566 where he was admitted to the Society of Jesus. Valignano&#x27;s insights into the Christian message convinced many within the Church that he was the perfect individual to carry the spirit of the Counter-Reformation to the Far East. He was ordained in the Society of Jesus and in 1573, at the age of 34, he was appointed Visitor of Missions in the Indies. He made his profession of the fourth vow after only seven years in the Society.

==India, Macau and China==
In spring of 1574, Valignano sailed for Goa as the newly appointed Visitor to the Province of India. and the next year called the first Congregation of the Indian province, on Chorão near Goa. The nomination of a Neapolitan to supervise Portugal-dominated Asia was controversial, and his nationality led to conflicts with mission personnel, as would later his adaptationist and expansionist policies.

As Visitor, it was his responsibility to examine and whenever necessary reorganize mission structures and methods throughout India, China, and Japan. He was given an enormous amount of leeway and discretion, especially for someone so young, and was answerable only to the Jesuit Superior General in Rome. His commanding presence was only increased by his unusual height, enough to &quot;turn heads in Europe and to draw crowds in Japan&quot;. Father Luis Frois wrote that crowds of Japanese would gather await to them, impressed by the height of Valigano and the dark skin color of Yasuke, Valigano&#x27;s valet of African origin. Valignano formed a basic strategy for Catholic proselytism, which is usually called &quot;adaptationism&quot;. He put the advance of Jesuits&#x27; influence above adherence to traditional Christian behavior. He attempted to avoid cultural frictions by making a compromise with local customs that other missionaries viewed as conflicting with Catholic values. His strategy was in contrast to those of mendicant orders including Franciscans and Dominicans, whom Valignano worked hard to block from entering Japan. This action eventually contributed to the Chinese Rites controversy.

Soon after Valignano arrived in Portuguese Macau in September 1578, he realized that no missionary stationed in Macau had succeeded in establishing himself in mainland China. In his view, to improve the Jesuits&#x27; penetration rate into the country and their success at converting the locals, it was necessary first to learn to speak, read, and write the Chinese language. To this end, he wrote to the order&#x27;s Superior in India, asking him to send to Macau a person who would be equal to the task, namely Bernardino de Ferraris (1537–1584). However, as de Ferraris was busy as the new rector of the Jesuits at Cochin, another Jesuit scholar, Michele Ruggieri, was sent to Macau.

Valignano left Macau for Japan in July 1579, leaving behind instructions for Ruggieri, who was to arrive within days. Once Ruggieri started studying Chinese and realized the immensity of the task, he wrote to Valignano, asking him to send Matteo Ricci to Macau as well, to share the work. Forwarded by Valignano to the Order&#x27;s Superior in India in 1580, Ruggieri&#x27;s request was fulfilled, and Ricci joined him in Macau 7 August 1582. Together, the two were to become the first European scholars of China and the Chinese language.

In 1594 Valignano founded St. Paul&#x27;s college in Macau.

==Japan==

Valignano exercised his position as Visitor by overseeing all of the Jesuit missions in Asia from the major Portuguese port of Macau. He had a particular focus on Japan, however, and made three extended visits there in 1579–1583, 1590–1592 and 1598–1603. 

During his first visit in 1581, he wrote &quot;Il Cerimoniale per i Missionari del Giappone&quot; to set forth guidelines for Jesuits. In the writing, he mapped Jesuit hierarchy to that of Zen Buddhists even though he detested them. He claimed that, in order not to be despised by the Japanese, every Jesuit should behave according to the class to which he belonged. As a result, Jesuit fathers served &quot;daimyōs&quot; sumptuous dishes and walked around Nagasaki with armed Japanese servants. He had arrived accompanied by an African servant named Yasuke, but Yasuke left him in 1581 to serve a daimyo.

Such a luxurious life and authoritarian attitudes among Jesuits in Japan were criticized not only by rival mendicant orders but also by some Jesuits. In addition, his detailed instructions on customs and manners suggest that his understanding of Japanese culture was only superficial. 

As was ordered by the Superior General, he devoted efforts to nurturing Japanese priests. He forced Francisco Cabral to resign as Superior of the Jesuit mission in Japan since Cabral opposed his plans. But it was not only Cabral who disagreed with Valignano. In fact, Valignano remained in a minority within the Jesuits in Japan. Valignano was optimistic about training of native priests, but many Jesuits doubted the sincerity of Japanese converts. Valignano himself came to hold a negative view after his second visit in Japan—although he did not give up his hope. After Valignano&#x27;s death, negative reports from Japan were reflected in the policies of the headquarters of the Society of Jesus in Rome in 1610s, and the society heavily restricted admission and ordination of Japanese Catholics. Ironically, persecution by the Tokugawa shogunate forced Jesuits to rely increasingly on Japanese believers. In spite of the headquarter&#x27;s policies, the Jesuit college in Macau, which was founded by Valignano, produced a dozen Japanese priests.

On his first arrival in Japan, Valignano was horrified by what he considered to be, at the least, negligent, and at the worst, abusive and un-Christian practices on the part of mission personnel.

Valignano later wrote that, although the mission had made some major gains during Francisco Cabral&#x27;s tenure, the general methods used by the Superior were severely lacking. In addition to the problems of Japanese language study and racism, some of the Jesuits, and specifically Cabral were in the habit &quot;to regard Japanese customs invariably as abnormal and to speak disparagingly of them. When I first came to Japan, ours (the crowd usually follows the leader), showed no care to learn Japanese customs, but at recreation and on other occasions were continually carping on them, arguing against them, and expressing their preference for our own ways to the great chagrin and disgust of the Japanese.&quot;

There is an implicit belief in the Visitor&#x27;s writing that leaders influence and are responsible for the behavior of those of lesser rank. Thus, in Valignano&#x27;s view, any lapse in the mission&#x27;s behavior towards the Japanese was surely a result of Cabral&#x27;s heavyhandedness. He immediately began to reform many aspects of the mission, and wherever possible, undermined Cabral&#x27;s authority as Superior of the Jesuit mission to Japan.

=== Language study ===

Language study had always been one of the core problems for the mission. Before the Visitor arrived in Japan, seventeen of Valignano&#x27;s personally appointed missionaries wrote to him complaining that language training was totally nonexistent. Cabral had protested that it was impossible for Europeans to learn Japanese and that even after fifteen years of study the &quot;padres&quot; could hardly preach a sermon, even to Christian converts.

It was Valignano&#x27;s first official act upon arriving in Japan that all new missionaries in the province spend two years in a language course, separating these newcomers by leaps and bounds from the first enthusiastic but stilted efforts of Francis Xavier. By 1595, Valignano could boast in a letter that not only had the Jesuits printed a Japanese grammar and dictionary, but also several books (mostly the lives of saints and martyrs) entirely in Japanese. The main body of the grammar and dictionary was compiled from 1590 to 1603; when finished, it was a truly comprehensive volume with the dictionary alone containing some 32,798 entries.

Where Cabral had worked to exclude Japanese men from rising beyond brothers in the Society, Valignano insisted that they be treated equally in every way to Europeans and while the Japanese seminarians would learn Latin for sacramental use, the Visitor remarks that it is Europeans who must learn Japanese customs, and not the other way around. This, it must be added, was the complete opposite of Cabral&#x27;s stated opinion that the Japanese must be adapted to Western ideas and modes of thought.

=== Establishment of the seminaries ===
The need for a trained native clergy was obvious to Valignano, and so, in 1580, a recently emptied Buddhist monastery in Arima province was converted into a nascent seminary. There, 22 young Japanese converts began receiving instructions towards holy orders. The process was repeated two years later at Azuchi, where the seminarians numbered 33.

The first order of business in the seminaries would be language training. Valignano made clear that all seminarians, whatever their background, would receive education in both Latin and Japanese. After the foundations were laid, the students were educated in moral theology, philosophy and Christian doctrine. This was typical of Jesuit education, and reflects the state of Jesuit schooling in Europe. But there were some significant differences. For one, as the Arima seminary was a converted Buddhist monastery, and because Valignano emphasized the need for cultural adaptation, the original décor was left largely unchanged. This pattern was repeated in other seminaries at other sites, and, in the 1580 &quot;Principles for the Administration of Japanese Seminaries&quot;, which goes into great detail about seminary methods, Valignano notes that the &quot;&quot;tatami&quot; mats should be changed every year&quot; and that students should wear &quot;&quot;katabira&quot; (summer clothes) or kimonos of blue cotton&quot; and outdoors a &quot;&quot;dobuku&quot; (black cloak).&quot; The students were instructed to eat white rice with sauce with a side dish of fish.

Valignano&#x27;s purpose is quite clear. The seminaries were typical Jesuit institutions of humanistic education and theological exploration but their style of living was wholly Japanese. They were carefully designed to blend, as much as possible, Japanese sensibilities with European ideology. In short, they were a perfect place to train Japanese preachers, men who would appeal to both their families and friends, and also to the Society. Some experts hypothesize that Valignano was actively trying to replicate the Japanese institution of &quot;dojuku&quot;, or novitiate monastics. This is probably an apt interpretation, because it does appear that the Catholic seminaries appealed to, but in typical Jesuit style were not limited to, many of the same sons of wealthy nobles as the Buddhist tradition of living as a novice in a monastery would have.

Valignano&#x27;s methodical and organized mind is apparent in every aspect of mission organization. Appended to his &quot;Principles for the Administration of Japanese Seminaries&quot; is a complete daily schedule for a Japanese seminarian. True to form, the scheduled activities include both daily Latin and Japanese instruction with a sprinkling of choral and other musical performance.

===Success of seminary reforms===

Despite their great idealism, it is unclear how successful Valignano&#x27;s seminary reforms really were. They certainly stimulated Japanese converts to join the Society; in the decade after Valignano&#x27;s first visit, some sixty native Japanese joined the Jesuits as novices. But there were problems too. Few Buddhist monks were forced to live under a rule of strict poverty as the Jesuits enforced it, and because gift-giving was such an important part of Japanese social relations, the inability of the novices to accept these gifts undoubtedly helped to alienate them from their families. 
In addition, the Ignatian mode of spirituality, with its emphasis on confession and examination of conscience struck the seminarians as terribly improper. Valignano, Cabral, and others had often noted how Japanese culture stressed the suppression and concealment of emotion. This problem was exacerbated by the inability of most of the Jesuits to fluently speak or understand the language. Revealing all of one&#x27;s secret thoughts to another, through an interpreter, was seen as a serious violation of social customs. 
Lastly, but even more fundamentally, Japanese culture did not and does not view religious life as totally separate from secular life in the sense that the Jesuits understood it. Within most Buddhist communities it is common, if not expected, that young men and women spend some time in seclusion as a monk or nun for a few years or months. It was no dishonor for a monk to take vows for a limited period of time and then return to his normal occupation, while the counter-Reformation era Roman Church, with its emphasis on vocation and eternal priesthood, could scarcely have been more different.

===Port of Nagasaki===

As the scale of the mission began to expand rapidly, financial difficulties began to crop up. All of the Jesuit institutions: the seminaries, the schools, the printing presses and the missions required money to finance. This eternal conflict, which Valignano describes as the one between &quot;God and Mammon&quot; raged for most of the history of the mission.

Originally local Japanese &quot;daimyo&quot; had tried to curry favor with the Jesuit administration in order to have the Portuguese trading ships visit their local ports more frequently. All of this changed in 1580 when Father Vilela converted the &quot;daimyo&quot; Ōmura Sumitada who controlled the port of Nagasaki. As a gift, the port, which was then merely a small fishing village, was ceded to the control of the Society, as was the fortress in the harbor.

The Superior General in Rome was shocked by the news of such a blatant acquisition of property and gave firm instructions that Jesuit control of Nagasaki should only be temporary. But like most suggestions coming from Europe, Cabral and Valignano chose to tactfully ignore them, especially because, as Valignano explained later, the town quickly became a haven for displaced and persecuted Christians.

Under Jesuit control, Nagasaki grew from a town with only one street to an international port rivaling the influence of Goa or Macau. Jesuit ownership of the Port of Nagasaki gave the Society a concrete monopoly in taxation over all imported goods coming into Japan. The society was most active in the Japanese silver trade, wherein large quantities of Japanese silver were shipped to Canton in exchange for Chinese silk; but the superiors of the mission were aware of the inherent distastefulness of Society involvement in mercantile transactions and resolved to keep the traffic to a minimum.

===Embassy to Europe===
Valignano was the initiator of the Tenshō embassy, the first official Japanese delegation to Europe, and accompanied the group of Japanese converts led by Mancio Ito from Nagasaki to Goa, from where he then returned to Macau. The delegation would sail on to Lisbon and spend several years in Europe where they were received with honors in Portugal, Spain, Florence, Rome, Venice and Milan.

===Conflicts with Rome and the Shogunate===

This breach of ecclesiastical practice did not go unnoticed by the heads of other European missions in the area, or by those who made their living via inter-Asiatic trade. Eventually, the Pope was forced to intervene, and, in 1585, the Holy See ordered an immediate cessation of all mercantile activities by the Society. Valignano made an impassioned appeal to the Pope, saying that he would forgo all trade as soon as the 12,000 ducats required to meet their annual expenses were forthcoming from another source. Abandoning the silk trade, he said, would be the equivalent to abandoning the mission to Japan, which was undoubtedly true. In a letter to the Superior General, Valignano asked for leniency and above all, trust: &quot;Your paternity must leave this matter to my conscience, because with the help of God I trust that I shall continue to think about it, and also to consider the good name of the society in Japan and China, and when it seems to me possible to do so I shall gradually reduce and finally abandon the trade.&quot;

But sufficient finances had to be secured from somewhere. By 1580, the society was maintaining a community of 150,000 people, 200 churches staffed with 85 Jesuits, including twenty Japanese brothers and an additional 100 acolytes. A decade later, there were 136 Jesuits in Japan with a caretaking staff of up to 300. At the height of the mission, there were about 600 people who were entirely dependent on the society for funds. All of this, in addition to the construction and maintenance of churches, schools, seminaries, and the printing press cost a great deal of money. Placed in the context of the widespread poverty that plagued Japan during this era, it is not surprising that the Valignano authorized the mission to rely on the tax income provided them by the Port of Nagasaki.

By 1600, the Jesuit mission there was in decline because of persecution from the ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi and later, most severely, under the Tokugawas. Tokugawa Ieyasu worked diligently to thwart all European attempts to reestablish contact with Japan, religious or otherwise, after his rise to power in 1603. All samurai and members of the army were required to forswear Christianity and remove Christian emblems or designs from their clothing. Later, &quot;daimyo&quot; and commoners were ordered to follow the same restrictions. In 1636, Tokugawa Iemitsu enacted the &quot;Sakoku&quot; edict which ended almost all contact with the outside world. No Japanese ships were allowed to leave the country under pain of death, and any Japanese who attempted to return from abroad would likewise be executed, policies which remained in force until American Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s arrival in 1853.

==Death and legacy==
Valignano died in Macau on 20 January 1606. He was buried at St. Paul&#x27;s college. 

One of his Jesuit admirers noted in his &quot;Panegyric&quot;: &quot;In [God] we lament not only our former visitor and father, but, as some would have it, the apostle of Japan.&quot; Valignano paved the way for a closer relationship between Asian and European peoples by advocating equal treatment of all human beings. He was a great admirer of the Japanese people and envisioned a future when Japan would be one of the leading Christian countries in the world. He memorably wrote that the Japanese &quot;excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well&quot;. Jesuit historian Thomas J. Campbell called him &quot;the greatest man of the [Jesuit] missions in the East after Francis Xavier.&quot; Ludwig von Pastor considered him the chief architect of the spread of Catholicism in 16th century Japan.

<text>Todd Alan Gitlin (January 6, 1943 – February 5, 2022) was an American sociologist, political activist and writer, novelist, and cultural commentator. He wrote about the mass media, politics, intellectual life, and the arts for both popular and scholarly publications.

== Background ==
Todd Alan Gitlin was born on January 6, 1943, in Manhattan and raised in the Bronx, the son of Dorothy (Siegel), who taught typing and stenography, and Max Gitlin, who taught high school history. His family was Jewish. He graduated as valedictorian from the Bronx High School of Science at the age of 16. Enrolling at Harvard College, he graduated in 1963 with an A.B. &quot;cum laude&quot; in mathematics and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. After his leadership in Students for a Democratic Society, he earned an M.A. in political science from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley.

===Personal life and death===
Gitlin lived in Manhattan and Hillsdale, New York. He was married three times: his first two marriages, to activist and lawyer Nancy Hollander and to Carol Wolman, ended in divorce, and his third, to Laurel Ann Cook, lasted from 1995 until his death.

On December 31, 2021, Gitlin went into cardiac arrest at his home in Hillsdale and was hospitalized in nearby Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where he contracted COVID-19. He died on February 5, 2022, at the age of 79.

== Career ==

=== Activism ===
Gitlin became a political activist in 1960, when he joined a Harvard undergraduate group called Tocsin, against nuclear weapons. He went on to become vice-chairman and then chairman of the group. He helped organize a national demonstration in Washington, February 16–17, 1962, against the arms race and nuclear testing. In 1963 and 1964, Gitlin was president of Students for a Democratic Society. He helped organize the first national demonstration against the Vietnam War, held in Washington, D.C., April 17, 1965, with 25,000 participants, as well as the first civil disobedience directed against American corporate support for the apartheid regime in South Africa—a sit-in at the Manhattan headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank on March 19, 1965. In 1968 and 1969, he was an editor at and a contributor to the &quot;San Francisco Express Times&quot;, an underground newspaper, and wrote regularly for underground papers via Liberation News Service.

In the mid-1980s, he was a leader of Berkeley&#x27;s Faculty for Full Divestment and president of Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni/-ae Against Apartheid. He actively opposed both the Gulf War of 1991 and the Iraq War of 2003. He vocally supported both the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the occupation of Afghanistan in 2002. In 2013, he became involved in the alumni wing of the Divest Harvard movement, seeking the university&#x27;s exit from fossil fuel corporations. He was also active in a Columbia faculty group supporting such divestment. He actively opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeted at Israel.

=== Academics ===
After teaching part-time 1970–77 at the New College of San Jose State University and the Community Studies program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, he worked for 16 years as professor of sociology and director of the mass communications program at UC Berkeley, then for seven years as a professor of culture, journalism and sociology at New York University.

Starting in 2002, he was a professor of journalism and sociology, and starting in 2006 he was also chair of the Ph.D. program in communications at Columbia University, where he also taught the Core course Contemporary Western Civilization as well as an American studies course on the 1960s.

During 1994–1995, he held the chair in American Civilization at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. He has been a resident at the Bellagio Study Center in Italy and the Djerassi Foundation in Woodside, California, a fellow at the Media Studies Center, and a visiting professor at Yale University, the University of Oslo, and the University of Toronto. During April and May 2011, Gitlin was the recipient of the Bosch Berlin Prize in Public Policy and Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin.

=== Public works ===

Gitlin wrote 16 books and hundreds of articles in dozens of publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Haaretz&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, &quot;Tablet&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones,&quot; &quot;Salon&quot;, and many more. He was a columnist for &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; and the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, and a frequent contributor to TPMcafe and &quot;The New Republic&quot; online as well as the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;. In 2016, he wrote regularly on media and the political campaign for BillMoyers.com. He was on the editorial board of &quot;Dissent&quot;. He was co-chair of the San Francisco branch of PEN American Center, a member of the board of directors of Greenpeace, and an early editor of openDemocracy. He gave hundreds of lectures at public occasions and universities in many countries.
In his early writings on media, especially &quot;The Whole World Is Watching&quot;, he called attention to the ideological framing of the New Left and other social movements, the vexed relations of leadership and celebrity, and the impact of coverage on the movements themselves. He was the first sociologist to apply Erving Goffman&#x27;s concept of &quot;frame&quot; to news analysis, and to show Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s &quot;hegemony&quot; at work in a detailed analysis of intellectual production. In &quot;Inside Prime Time&quot;, he analyzes the workings of the television entertainment industry of the early 1980s, discerning the implicit procedures that guide network executives and other television &quot;players&quot; to make their decisions. In &quot;The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage&quot;, a memoir and analysis combined, he develops a sense of the tensions between expressive and strategic politics. In &quot;The Twilight of Common Dreams&quot;, he asks why the groups that constitute the American left so often turn to infighting, rather than solidarity. In &quot;Media Unlimited&quot;, he turns to the unceasing flow of the media torrent, the problems of attention and distraction, and the emotional payoffs of media experience (which he called &quot;disposable emotions&quot;) in our time. In &quot;Occupy Nation: The Roots, the Spirit, and the Promise of Occupy Wall Street&quot;, he distinguishes between &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; movements and analyzes their respective strengths and weaknesses.
In &quot;The Whole World Is Watching: Mass Media in the Making and Unmaking of the New Left&quot;, &quot;The Sixties&quot;, The &quot;Twilight of Common Dreams: Why America Is Wracked with Culture Wars&quot;, &quot;Letters to a Young Activist&quot;, and &quot;The Intellectuals and the Flag&quot;, Gitlin became a prominent critic of the tactics and rhetoric of both the left and the right. Supporting active, strategically focused nonviolent movements, he emphasizes what he sees as the need in American politics to form coalitions between disparate movements, which must compromise ideological purity to gain and sustain power. During the George W. Bush administration, he argued that the Republican Party managed to accomplish that with a coalition of what he called two &quot;major components—the low-tax, love-business, hate-government enthusiasts and the God-save-us moral crusaders&quot; but that the Democratic Party has often been unable to accomplish a pragmatic coalition between its &quot;roughly eight&quot; constituencies, which he identifies as &quot;labor, African Americans, Hispanics, feminists, gays, environmentalists, members of the helping professions (teachers, social workers, nurses), and the militantly liberal, especially antiwar denizens of avant-garde cultural zones such as university towns, the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and so on.&quot; (from &quot;The Bulldozer and the Big Tent&quot;, pp. 18–19).

In the 2010 book &quot;The Chosen Peoples: America, Israel, and the Ordeals of Divine Election&quot;, he and Liel Leibovitz traced parallel themes in the history of the Jews and the Americans through history down to the present.

=== Novelist ===
Gitlin published three novels: &quot;The Murder of Albert Einstein&quot; (1992), &quot;Sacrifice&quot; (1999), and &quot;Undying&quot; (2011). &quot;Sacrifice&quot; won the Harold U. Ribalow Award for the best fiction on Jewish themes. His novel &quot;The Opposition&quot; is forthcoming and it follows a group of 1960s activists through the decade.

<doc id="939470" wikidata="Q3742442" url="?curid=939470" title="Extended producer responsibility">
<text>Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a strategy to add all of the estimated environmental costs associated with a product throughout the product life cycle to the market price of that product, contemporarily mainly applied in the field of waste management. Such societal costs are typically externalities to market mechanisms, with a common example being the impact of cars.

Extended producer responsibility legislation is a driving force behind the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives because it &quot;focuses on the end-of-use treatment of consumer products and has the primary aim to increase the amount and degree of product recovery and to minimize the environmental impact of waste materials&quot;.

Passing responsibility to producers as polluters is not only a matter of environmental policy but also the most effective means of achieving higher environmental standards in product design.

==Origin==
The concept was first formally introduced in Sweden by Thomas Lindhqvist in a 1990 report to the Swedish Ministry of the Environment. In subsequent reports prepared for the Ministry, the following definition emerged: &quot;[EPR] is an environmental protection strategy to reach an environmental objective of a decreased total environmental impact of a product, by making the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life-cycle of the product and especially for the take-back, recycling and final disposal.&quot;

==Definition==
Extended producer responsibility uses financial incentives to encourage manufacturers to design environmentally friendly products by holding producers responsible for the costs of managing their products at end of life. This policy approach differs from product stewardship, which shares responsibility across the chain of custody of a product, in that it attempts to relieve local governments of the costs of managing certain priority products by requiring manufacturers to internalize the cost of recycling within the product price. EPR is based on the principle that manufacturers (usually brand owners) have the greatest control over product design and marketing and have the greatest ability and responsibility to reduce toxicity and waste.

EPR may take the form of a reuse, , or recycling program. The producer may also choose to delegate this responsibility to a third party, a so-called &quot;producer responsibility organization&quot; (PRO), which is paid by the producer for used-product management. In this way, EPR shifts the responsibility for waste management from government to private industry, obliging producers, importers and/or sellers to internalise waste management costs in their product prices and ensure the safe handling of their products. However, different stakeholders perceive the concept and the role of producers in various ways.

A good example of a producer responsibility organization is PRO Europe S.P.R.L. (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe), founded in 1995, the umbrella organization for European packaging and packaging waste recovery and recycling schemes. Product stewardship organizations like PRO Europe are intended to relieve industrial companies and commercial enterprises of their individual obligation to take back used products through the operation of an organization which fulfills these obligations on a nationwide basis on behalf of their member companies. The aim is to ensure the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in the most economically efficient and ecologically sound manner. In many countries, this is done through the Green Dot trademark of which PRO Europe is the general licensor. In twenty-five nations, companies are now using the Green Dot as the financing symbol for the organization of recovery, sorting and recycling of sales packaging.

== OECD guidance manuals ==
The OECD published a guidance manual about EPR in 2001 after several years of discussion by experts in this field, and updated it in 2016 to include developing countries&#x27; perspectives, based on experiences and policy changes.

==Take-back==

In response to the growing problem of excessive waste, several countries adopted waste management policies in which manufacturers are responsible for taking back their products from end users at the end of the products&#x27; useful life, or partially financing a collection and recycling infrastructure. These policies were adopted due to the lack of collection infrastructure for certain products that contain hazardous materials, or due to the high costs to local governments of providing such collection services. The primary goals of these take-back laws therefore are to partner with the private sector to ensure that all waste is managed in a way that protects public health and the environment.
The goals of take-back laws are to
# encourage companies to design products for reuse, recyclability, and materials reduction;
# correct market signals to the consumer by incorporating waste management costs into product price;
# promote innovation in recycling technology.
Take-back programs help promote these goals by creating incentives for companies to design products that minimize waste management costs, to design products that contain safer materials (so they do not need to be managed separately), or to design products that are easier to recycle and reuse (so recycling becomes more profitable). The earliest take-back activity began in Europe, where government-sponsored take-back initiatives arose from concerns about scarce landfill space and potentially hazardous substances in component parts. The European Union adopted a directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). The purpose of this directive is to prevent the production of waste electronics and also to encourage reuse and recycling of such waste. The directive requires the Member States to encourage design and production methods that take into account the future dismantling and recovery of their products. These take-back programs have been adopted in nearly every OECD country. In the United States, most of these policies have been implemented at the state level.

== Plastic bags ==

Recycling, banning, and taxation fails to adequately reduce the pollution caused by plastic bags. An alternative to these policies would be to increase extended producer responsibility. In the US, under the Clinton presidency, the President&#x27;s Council on Sustainable Development suggested EPR in order to target different participants in the cycle of a product&#x27;s life. This can, however, make the product more expensive since the cost must be taken into consideration before being put on the market, which is why it is not widely used in the United States currently. Instead, there is banning or taxation of plastic bags, which puts the responsibility on the consumers. In the United States, EPR is voluntary. What has been recommended is a comprehensive program which combines taxation, producer responsibility, and recycling to combat pollution.

==Electronics==
Many governments and companies have adopted extended producer responsibility to help address the growing problem of e-waste—used electrical and electronic equipment that contains materials that cannot be safely thrown away with regular household trash. In 2007, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, people threw away 2.5 million tons of cell phones, TVs, computers, and printers. Many governments have partnered with corporations in creating the necessary collection and recycling infrastructure.

The kinds of chemicals found in e-waste that are particularly dangerous to human health and the environment are lead, mercury, brominated flame-retardants, and cadmium. Lead is found in the screens of phones, TVs and computer monitors and can damage kidneys, nerves, blood, bones, reproductive organs, and muscles. Mercury is found in flat screen TVs, laptop screens, and fluorescent bulbs, and can cause damage to the kidneys and the nervous system. Brominated flame-retardants found in cables and plastic cases can cause cancer, disruption of liver function, and nerve damage. Cadmium is found in rechargeable batteries and can cause kidney damage and cancer. Poorer countries are dumping grounds for e-waste as many governments accept money for disposing of this waste on their lands. This causes increased health risks for people in these countries, especially ones who work or live close to these dumps.

In the United States, 25 states have implemented laws that require the recycling of electronic waste. Of those, 23 have incorporated some form of extended producer responsibility into their laws. According to analysis done by the Product Stewardship Institute, some states have not enacted EPR laws because of a lack of recycling infrastructure and funds for proper e-waste disposal. In contrast, according to a study of EPR legislation by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition (ETBC), states that have seen success in their e-waste recycling programs have done so because they have developed a convenient e-waste infrastructure or the state governments have instituted goals for manufacturers to meet.

Advocates for EPR also argue that including &quot;high expectations for performance&quot; into the laws, and ensuring that those are only minimum requirements, contribute to making the laws successful. The larger the scope of products that can be collected, the more e-waste will be disposed of properly.

Similar laws have been passed in other parts of the world as well. The European Union has taken steps to address some electronic waste management issues. They have restricted the use of harmful substances in member countries and have made it illegal to export waste.

China banned the import of e-waste in 2000, and adopted EPR in 2012. This has proven to be difficult, however, because illegal smuggling of waste still occurs in the country. In order to dispose of e-waste in China today, a license is required and plants are held responsible for treating pollution. EPR laws in the U.S. still allow e-waste to be exported to China. The Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) has also proposed a deposit-refund system dealt with by producers.

===Advantages===

When producers face either the financial or physical burden of recycling their electronics after use, they may be incentivized to design more sustainable, less toxic, and more easily recyclable electronics. Using fewer materials and designing products to last longer can directly reduce producers&#x27; end-of-life costs. Thus, extended producer responsibility is often cited as one way to fight planned obsolescence, because it financially encourages manufacturers to design for recycling and make products last longer. In addition to fighting planned obsolescence, by allocating part of the financial responsibility for paying for and managing waste on the producer, the pressures placed on governments may be alleviated. Currently, many governments bear the weight of disposal and spend millions of dollars on collecting and removing electronic waste. However, these plans usually fail because governments do not have enough money to create and enforce them properly. Placing responsibility on producers to dispose of their products can give governments more freedom to create legislation which benefits sustainability with little cost to both parties, while also raising awareness about the issues EPR seeks to solve.

One of the advantages of EPR is that it becomes more and more effective as the EPR policy puts pressure on countries that export their E-waste. The regulation of this E-waste forces infrastructure to deal with the waste or implement new ways of creating products from the producers. As more countries adopt these policies it restricts other countries from ignoring the issues. For example, when China stopped importing E-waste from the U.S., a build-up of waste was formed at ports. The lack of infrastructure around recycling E-waste in the US has been possible because of the ability to export and the negligence of producers. The pressure of this growing dump of E-waste forces countries to have their own infrastructure and will force more regulations from the government, state and federal, to be placed on producers.

===Disadvantages===
Some people have concerns about extended producer responsibility programs for complex electronics that can be difficult to safely recycle, such as lithium-ion polymer batteries. Others worry that such laws could increase the cost of electronics because producers would add recycling costs into the initial price tag. When companies are required to transport their products to a recycling facility, it can be expensive if the product contains hazardous materials and does not have a scrap value, such as with CRT televisions, which can contain up to five pounds of lead. Organizations and researchers against EPR claim that the mandate would slow innovation and impede technological progress.

Other critics are concerned that manufacturers may use takeback programs to take secondhand electronics off the reuse market, by shredding rather than reusing or repairing goods that come in for recycling. Another argument against EPR is that EPR policies are not accelerating environmentally friendly designs because &quot;manufacturers are already starting to moving toward reduced material-use per unit of output, reduced energy use in making and delivering each product, and improved environmental performance.&quot;

The Reason Foundation argues that EPR is not clear in the way fees are established for the particular recycling processes. Fees are set in place to help incentivize recycling, but this may deter the use of manufacturing with better materials for the different electronic products. There are not set fees for certain materials, so confusion occurs when companies do not know what design features to include in their devices.

==Fossil fuels==
A study suggests that applying the principle of extended producer responsibility to fossil fuels could deconflict energy security and climate policy at an affordable cost; in particular, authors suggested the responsibility could be used to establish the financing of storage and nature-based solutions.

==Implementation==

EPR has been implemented in many forms, which may be classified into three major approaches:
* Mandatory
* Negotiated
* Voluntary

It is perhaps because of the tendency of economic policy in market-driven economies not to interfere with consumers&#x27; preferences that the producer-centric representation is the dominant form of viewing the environmental impacts of industrial production: in statistics on energy, emissions, water, etc., impacts are almost always presented as attributes of industries (&quot;on-site&quot; or &quot;direct&quot; allocation) rather than as attributes of the supply chains of products for consumers. On a smaller scale, most existing schemes for corporate sustainability reporting include only impacts that arise out of operations controlled by the reporting company, and not supply-chain impacts According to this world view, &quot;upstream and downstream [environmental] impacts are ... allocated to their immediate producers. The institutional setting and the different actors&#x27; spheres of influence are not reflected&quot;.

On the other hand, a number of studies have highlighted that final consumption and affluence, especially in the industrialised world, are the main drivers for the level and growth of environmental pressure. Even though these studies provide a clear incentive for complementing producer-focused environmental policy with some consideration for consumption-related aspects, demand-side measures to address environmental problems are rarely exploited.

The nexus created by the different views on impacts caused by industrial production is exemplified by several contributions to the discussion about producer or consumer responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions data are reported to the IPCC as contributions of producing industries located in a particular country rather than as embodiments in products consumed by a particular population, irrespective of productive origin. However, especially for open economies, taking into account the greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on national greenhouse gas balance sheets. Assuming consumer responsibility, exports have to be subtracted from, and imports added to national greenhouse gas inventories. In Denmark, for example, Munksgaard and Pedersen (2001) report that a significant amount of power and other energy-intensive commodities are traded across Danish borders, and that between 1966 and 1994 the Danish foreign trade balance in terms of CO2 developed from a 7 Mt deficit to a 7 Mt surplus, compared to total emissions of approximately 60 Mt. In particular, electricity traded between Norway, Sweden and Denmark is subject to large annual fluctuations due to varying rainfall in Norway and Sweden. In wet years Denmark imports hydro-electricity whereas electricity from coal-fired power plants is exported in dry years. The official Danish emissions inventory includes a correction for electricity trade and thus applies the consumer responsibility principle.

Similarly, at the company level, &quot;when adopting the concept of eco-efficiency and the scope of an environmental management system stated in for example ISO 14001, it is insufficient to merely report on the carbon dioxide emissions limited to the judicial borders of the company&quot;. 7 &quot;Companies must recognise their wider responsibility and manage the entire life-cycle of their products ... Insisting on high environmental standards from suppliers and ensuring that raw materials are extracted or produced in an environmentally conscious way provides a start.&quot; A life-cycle perspective is also taken in EPR frameworks: &quot;Producers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility (physical and/or financial) not only for the environmental impacts of their products downstream from the treatment and disposal of their product, but also for their upstream activities inherent in the selection of materials and in the design of products.&quot; &quot;The major impetus for EPR came from northern European countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as they were facing severe landfill shortages. [... As a result,] EPR is generally applied to post-consumer wastes which place increasing physical and financial demands on municipal waste management.&quot;

EPR has rarely been consistently quantified. Moreover, applying conventional life cycle assessment, and assigning environmental impacts to producers and consumers can lead to double-counting. Using input-output analysis, researchers have attempted for decades to account for both producers and consumers in an economy in a consistent way. Gallego and Lenzen demonstrate and discuss a method of consistently delineating producers&#x27; supply chains, into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive responsibilities to be shared by all agents in an economy. Their method is an approach to allocating responsibility across agents in a fully inter-connected circular system. Upstream and downstream environmental impacts are shared between all agents of a supply chain—producers and consumers.

==Examples==

Auto Recycling Nederland (ARN) is a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) that organises vehicle recycling in the Netherlands. An advanced recycling fee is charged to those who purchase a new vehicle and is used to fund the recycling of it at the end of its useful life. The PRO was set up to satisfy the European Union&#x27;s End of Life Vehicles Directive.

The Swiss Association for Information, Communication and Organisational Technology (SWICO), an ICT industry organisation, became a PRO to address the problem of electronic waste.

The Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility (CAP-EPR) was adopted in Canada in 2009 under the guidance of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The CAP-EPR followed years of waste and recycling efforts in Canada that remained largely ineffective as the diversion rates from landfills and incineration persisted. Despite three decades worth of recycling efforts, Canada fell short of many other G8 and OECD countries. Since the CAP-EPR&#x27;s 2009 inception, most provinces have enforced legislation or restrictions on a wider range of products and materials under EPR programs. &quot;Nine out of ten provinces have [since implemented] EPR programs or [put] requirements in place... As a result of these new programs or requirements and expansion of existing ones, almost half of the product categories for Phase 1 are now covered by legislated EPR programs or requirements across Canada.&quot;

In Russia, EPR was launched in 2015 but financing of waste management facilities still largely relies on taxes paid by the Russian population. In 2022, all packaging was supposed to be recycled or else products from companies not respecting the regulation would have been withdrawn from shelves. But the country postponed the reform as several ministers found it unfeasible.

In the United Kingdom an extended producer responsibility system is going to be implemented over the coming years. The government has already shared guidance with those most affected. The core issue is with identifying a way to encourage polluters to take on the responsibility rather than pass on the cost to suppliers or end consumers

In India, the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 introduced the concept of EPR for the first time, while the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 set more stringent targets for collection of end-of-life products and simplified the process of applying for EPR authorization. In 2016, government expanded the EPR approach to tackle plastic waste through the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. In the Indian system, the trading mechanism is similar to the carbon trading mechanism, where EPR certificates are generated and traded further between the producers and brand owners.

In Austria, the polluter-pays principle was introduced on 1 January 2023. Thus, the costs of recycling are paid by the companies that produce it.

==Results==
In Germany, since the adoption of EPR, &quot;between 1991 and 1998, the per capita consumption of packaging was reduced from 94.7 kg to 82 kg, resulting in a reduction of 13.4%&quot;. Furthermore, due to Germany&#x27;s influence in EPR, the &quot;European Commission developed one waste directive&quot; for all EU member states […] One major goal was to have all member states recycle &quot;25% of all packaging material&quot; and the goal has been accomplished.

In the United States, EPR is gaining popularity &quot;with 40 such laws enacted since 2008. In 2010 alone, 38 such EPR bills were introduced in state legislatures across the United States, and 12 were signed into law.&quot; However, these laws are at the state level: there are no federal laws for EPR. So far, &quot;only a handful of states have imposed five to six EPR laws as well as 32 states having at least one EPR law&quot;.

From 2022, if the product is sold in France or Germany, Marketplaces must confirm that the manufacturer complies with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) rules in the country where it sells the product.

<text>The &quot;Delhi-&quot;class destroyers, also known Project 15 are a class guided-missile destroyers of the Indian Navy. Three ships of this class are in active service. The &quot;Delhi&quot;-class vessels were the largest vessels to be built in India at the time of their commissioning. The ships were built by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) at a cost of each.

==Development==
The design and development of the ship class began as &quot;Project 15&quot; in 1980. Initially, the ships were planned to be follow-on frigates of the with the addition of RBU-6000 ASW rocket launchers and gas turbine propulsion. A Soviet offer in 1983 for reversible gas turbines and modern weapon systems forced a redesign of the ships from 3,500-tonne frigates to 6,300-tonne destroyers. The Directorate of Naval Design completed the design around the mid 1980s. Model tests were carried out at SSPA, Sweden in 1985 and parallelly at Krylov Institute, Soviet Union in 1986. Severnoye Design Bureau provided design inputs for weapons and propulsion packages. The mutual interface suppression system for electromagnetic compatibility was supplied by the Soviets. The break-up of the Soviet Union affected the supply of weapon systems, contributing to a three-year delay in the construction of vessels.

==Design and description==

The &quot;Delhi&quot; class has been described as a stretched with some elements incorporated from &quot;Godavari&quot;-class frigates and s. The fore funnel is placed on the port side, while the aft funnel is placed on the starboard. The propulsion system consists of two Zorya-Mashproekt M36E gas turbine plants driving two controllable-pitch propellers. Each gas turbine plant comprises two DT-59 reversible gas turbines connected to an RG-54 gearbox in a combined gas and gas system and is placed in a separate engine room. The vessels are equipped for operation in a nuclear, biological and chemical warfare environment. &quot;Delhi&quot;-class vessels are fitted with flag facilities, enabling them to act as command unit in task groups. features better air conditioning facilities to correct heat dissipation issues encountered while operationalising .

===Armament===

For air defence role, &quot;Delhi&quot; class is fitted with 9K-90 &quot;Uragan&quot; (NATO: SA-N-7 Gadfly) air-defence system comprising a pair of 3S-90 single-arm launchers and 9M38M1 &quot;Shtil&quot; missiles. One launcher is installed forward of the bridge and the other atop the dual helicopter hangar. Each launcher carries a 24 missile magazine for a total of 48 rounds. The missiles have range and feature semi-active radar homing. MR-775 Fregat-MAE (NATO: Half Plate) radar provides target designation and six MR-90/3R-90 &quot;Orekh&quot; (NATO: Front Dome) illuminators are used for fire control. The system can track twelve targets and engage a maximum of six tracked targets simultaneously. Last-ditch missile defence is provided by AK-630-based close-in weapon system. As of 2024, all three vessels of the class have been upgraded with an additional IAI/Rafael Barak 1 point defence missile system. Originally four AK-630 rotary cannons surrounding the aft mast, which are guided by two MR-123-02 (NATO: Bass Tilt) fire-control radars were installed but after Midlife Refit, the two AK-630 mounts ahead of the aft mast have each been replaced by pair of eight-cell Barak 1 vertical launch systems, for a total of 32 missiles. The missiles have a range of and use command line-of-sight guidance provided by a pair of EL/M-2221 fire-control radars that replace MR-123-02 fire-control radars on upgraded ships. A Signaal LW08 radar license produced by BEL as RAWL provides long range air search capability.

The surface missile battery of &quot;Delhi&quot; class includes 16 Kh-35E &quot;Uran&quot; missiles placed in four quadruple sloped launchers. The missiles feature active radar homing and are guided by a Granit Garpun B (NATO: Plank Shave) fire-control radar. They have a maximum range of and are capable of sea skimming. The missile battery was initially intended to be eight 3M80E &quot;Moskit&quot; cruise missiles as evidenced by large blast deflectors present on the lead ship, INS &quot;Delhi&quot;. A single AK-100 gun guided by MR-184/MR-145 fire-control system (NATO: Kite Screech), which comprises T-91E radar and Kondensor electro-optical sights, was originally fitted to the ships. The three ships have replaced the 100mm guns with OTO Melara 76 mm naval gun during refits in the early 2020s.

A quintuple trainable torpedo launcher capable of firing SET 65E active/passive homing torpedo and Type 53–65 wake homing torpedo is placed in between the funnels. A pair of 12-tubed RBU-6000 213mm anti-submarine rocket launchers fitted in front of the bridge can engage submarines up to a range of . Detection is provided by BEL HUMVAD, an indigenous hull-mounted sonar with a variable depth transducer that offers better performance in the waters around India. An Indal Model 15-750 handling system manufactured by GRSE is used to deploy the variable depth sonar of HUMVAD. The final ship of the class, , is fitted with an improved ASW suite consisting of BEL HUMSA hull-mounted sonar and Thales ATAS towed array sonar.

The electronic warfare suite originally consisted of BEL Ajanta Mk 2 for electronic support measures, Elettronica TQN-2 jammer and two PK-2 chaff launchers of Russian origin. The Ajanta Mk 2 system was later replaced by Ellora, which has an additional capability to provide electronic countermeasures. BEL Shikari combat display and management system, a derivative of Italian IPN-10, integrates weapon systems of diverse origin. Each vessel can carry two Westland Sea King Mk 42B helicopters. The helicopters carry a surface search radar, a dipping sonar, A244-S lightweight torpedoes and Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. Samahé helicopter handling system is fitted on all vessels.

=== Modernisation ===

As of January 2024, INS Delhi (D61) and INS Mumbai (D62) has completed their mid-life refit that includes upgrades for several weapons and sensors. The Kh-35E &quot;Uran&quot; missiles has been replaced by BrahMos missiles, which was originally sanctioned in 2015 for two ships of this class. The primary radar has been replaced with Fregat M2EM radar from the older MR-755 Fregat-MAE. The AK-100 main gun has been replaced by OTO Melara 76 mm along with BEL Lynx U2 FCR. The electronics warfare system is upgraded to Ellora Mk II, with Kavach decoy launchers. Atlas Elektronik ACTAS towed-array sonar will be installed on all three ships. In April 2022, Brahmos missile was tested from INS &quot;Delhi&quot; with new modular slant launcher design.

===Relocation===

The &quot;Delhi&quot;-class destroyers will be re-based to the Eastern Naval Command, Visakhapatnam. Along with , these will form a part of the carrier battle group of . had reached its new base by December 2021 and was undergoing refit.

<text>Tranquility, also known as Node 3, is a module of the International Space Station (ISS). It contains environmental control systems, life support systems, a toilet, exercise equipment, and an observation cupola.

The European Space Agency (ESA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) had &quot;Tranquility&quot; manufactured by Thales Alenia Space. A ceremony on 20 November 2009 transferred ownership of the module to NASA. On 8 February 2010, NASA launched the module on the Space Shuttle&#x27;s STS-130 mission.

== Design and manufacturing ==

&quot;Tranquility&quot; was built within the ESA-NASA ISS bartering system. ESA committed to build and fund both &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Tranquility&quot; as well as the ATV in order to use NASA ISS facilities, fly astronauts on the Shuttle and for other ISS services. ESA teamed up with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to manufacture both &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Tranquility&quot; at Thales Alenia Space&#x27;s site in Turin, Italy. The module pressure shell is constructed of 2219 aluminum and its debris shield is made from hardened 6061 aluminum. The metal is heat-treated, enabling it to have similar ballistics resistance to stainless steel.

&quot;Tranquility&quot; provides six berthing locations with power, data and commanding, thermal and environmental control, and crew access for more attached habitable volumes or for crew transportation vehicles or stowage, or an appropriate combination of all of these. One of the berthing locations is used by the &quot;Cupola&quot;, which houses a Robotic Work Station inside it to assist in the assembly/maintenance of the ISS, and offers a window for Earth observations. &quot;Tranquility&quot; was launched with the &quot;Cupola&quot; attached to its port-facing Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM). After mating &quot;Tranquility&quot; with the port CBM of &quot;Unity&quot;, the &quot;Cupola&quot; was transferred to the nadir facing port of &quot;Tranquility&quot; where it will stay.

The module has three redundant berthing ports that were not scheduled to be used prior to the end of the Space Shuttle program, although there is a Power Data Grapple Fixture reserved for the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (Dextre), which is located on the zenith berthing location. In the current ISS configuration &quot;Tranquility&quot; is docked to the port berthing location of &quot;Unity&quot;. As such, the three unused berthing locations of &quot;Tranquility&quot; were disabled as the node&#x27;s close proximity to other segments would prohibit the port&#x27;s direct use for cargo spacecraft or using the docking module PMA-3, which was relocated from &quot;Harmony&quot; to the port berthing location of &quot;Tranquility&quot; for storage. At the time, the move of PMA-3 to the port location of &quot;Tranquility&quot; was required because NASA decided to leave the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) &quot;Leonardo&quot; permanently attached to the ISS, which will be located at the nadir side of &quot;Unity&quot;.

In 2001, NASA considered changing the design of the module. This idea for an extended or &quot;stretched&quot; module, was a result of the deferral/deletion of the Habitation Module. The stretched module would have held 16 racks, compared with the baseline capacity of eight racks. This modification was not funded and the plans were abandoned.

== Purpose ==
The module&#x27;s life-support system (ECLSS) recycles waste water for crew use and generates oxygen for the crew to breathe. In addition, &quot;Tranquility&quot; contains an atmosphere revitalization system to remove contaminants from the atmosphere and monitor/control the atmosphere constituents of the ISS. &quot;Tranquility&quot; also contains a Waste and Hygiene Compartment (toilet) for supporting the on-board crew.

&quot;Tranquility&quot; is primarily used for exercise, storage, and robotics work in connection with &quot;Cupola&quot;.

== Launch, berthing, and connections to other station components ==
&quot;Tranquility&quot; was located in the clean room at the Thales Alenia Space, Turin site until 2009. It was shipped to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 17 May 2009 and arrived in Florida on 20 May 2009. It was officially welcomed to KSC on 8 June 2009.

&quot;Tranquility&quot; was launched on 8 February 2010 on board the STS-130 mission flown by &quot;Endeavour&quot;. It was berthed to the port side of &quot;Unity&quot; on 12 February 2010.

To accommodate the SpaceX Dragon V2 and Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew transports expected to be operational by 2017, ISS crews began work in March 2015 to configure the station. As part of this work, Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 on the port side of &quot;Tranquility&quot; will be moved to the zenith port of the &quot;Harmony&quot; module, above Pressurized Mating Adapter-2, to serve as a backup docking port for these vehicles. In addition, on 27 May 2015 the &quot;Leonardo&quot; Permanent Multipurpose Module was moved from the nadir of &quot;Unity&quot;, to the forward port side of &quot;Tranquility&quot; to free up &quot;Unity&quot; as a backup port for Commercial Resupply Services cargo spacecraft from SpaceX and Orbital Sciences.

In April 2016, as part of the cargo payload from SpaceX CRS-8, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) was attached to &quot;Tranquility&quot; on its aft port for a two-year duration.

== Naming contest ==
NASA held an online poll to name Node 3. Users were allowed to choose from among four provided names (Earthrise, Legacy, Serenity, and Venture), or to suggest their own. In early voting, fans of the science fiction TV series &quot;Firefly&quot; boosted &quot;Serenity&quot;, also the name of the show and film&#x27;s eponymous spacecraft, to the top with 86%. On 3 March 2009, episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, host Stephen Colbert instructed his viewers to suggest &quot;Colbert&quot; as the name for Node 3 in the online poll.

Following Colbert&#x27;s call to have the node named after him, several other groups attempted to influence the vote. For example, a number of different environmental groups promoted the name &quot;Amazonia&quot;, after the Amazon Rainforest. They argued that the name was more appropriate given that Node 3 will include the station&#x27;s environmental control systems. Humorist Dave Barry urged readers of his blog to name the node &quot;Buddy&quot;, which finished as the sixth most popular user-suggested name. Gaia Online asked its users to &quot;Send Gaia to Space&quot; by naming the node &quot;Gaia&quot;, referring to the Greek goddess of the planet Earth, and &quot;Gaia&quot; finished third among the user-suggested names. Other popular user suggestions included &quot;myYearbook&quot;, &quot;SocialVibe&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, and the name of Scientology&#x27;s galactic overlord: &quot;Xenu&quot;. 

&quot;Serenity&quot; was the top choice among the NASA-provided names, with 70% of the vote, but finished second overall, losing to &quot;Colbert&quot; by more than 40,000 votes. The naming contest rules, however, state that although the poll results will be taken into account, NASA has ultimate discretion in choosing an appropriate name for the node. On 6 April 2009, Stephen Colbert, in jest, threatened a lawsuit if the node was not named after him. In addition, United States Congressman Chaka Fattah stated that he believes that paying attention to democracy and voting results should not be limited to earthbound organizations so he planned to use congressional power to force NASA to honor the winning Colbert write-in votes.

On 14 April 2009, astronaut Sunita Williams appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, and announced the name of the node would be &quot;Tranquility&quot;. The name was chosen in honor of the 40th Anniversary of the first lunar landing of Apollo 11 on the Sea of Tranquility. However, the treadmill the astronauts use for exercise has been named &quot;C.O.L.B.E.R.T.&quot; for &quot;Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill&quot; and is located in &quot;Tranquility&quot;. Colbert was thrilled and happily accepted this offer. The treadmill traveled to space aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-128 on 28 August 2009, for eventual installation in the &quot;Tranquility&quot; node during STS-130.

<text>Tierra caliente is an informal term used in Latin America to refer to places with a distinctly tropical climate. These are usually regions from 0 to 3,000 feet above sea level.
The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal used the altitude of 1,000 m as the border between the tropical rain forest and the subtropical cloud forest (&quot;Yunga fluvial&quot;).

Most tierra caliente regions are along coastal plains, but some interior basin regions also fit the label. Agriculture in those areas is dominated by tropical crops, such as bananas and sugar cane.

<text>Ivan Aralica (born 10 September 1930) is a Croatian novelist and essayist.

== Biography ==
Born in Promina near Knin, and having finished pedagogical school and Philosophical Faculty at the University of Zadar, Aralica had worked since 1953 as a high school teacher in the backwater villages of the rural hinterland of northern and central Dalmatia. After a period of communist infatuation (which resulted in a few weak novellas that can be labeled as socialist realism period pieces), Aralica was swept into the vortex of turbulent events known as the Croatian Spring (1971). During this tumultuous era he allied with those who advocated greater Croatian autonomy and freedom for Croatian people in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The crackdown on the Croatian national movement and subsequent professional and social degradation resulted in Aralica&#x27;s return to his Christian and Catholic roots, abandonment of doctrinaire propagandist literature and formation of his own literary credo. Among world authors, he was influenced chiefly by realist fiction and early modernism, the key authors being Ivo Andrić, Thomas Mann and Knut Hamsun.

From 1979 to 1989 Aralica published eight novels, which can be best described as modernist rewritings of historical fiction. The best among them (/&quot;Dogs at a bazaar&quot;, 1979; /&quot;Slaves&#x27; souls&quot;, 1984; /&quot;Builder of an inn&quot;, 1986; /&quot;Asmodey&#x27;s shawl&quot;, 1988) show similar traits: these are essentially novels of complex narrative techniques recreating dramatic events in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina from 16th to 18th century and describing historical fatum of Croats caught in the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;- a three centuries long warfare between the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and Venice. Aralica successfully mastered many divergent elements in his fiction, so that his finest novels are both replete with contemplative wisdom sayings on human condition and rammed with action; also, his artistry is expressed in numerous naturalist passages integrated in the overarching Christian vision of life where natural and the supernatural fuse into one reality.

After the reintroduction of a multi-party system in 1990 and subsequent breakup of Yugoslavia, Aralica was elected to the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts; also, he re-entered politics, this time on the list of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), then headed by the first president of Croatia since its independence Franjo Tuđman. Aralica held a few influential positions, the most important among them being vice-president of Croatian Parliament. During this period he wrote two books of political essays (one about the genesis of Serbian imperialism, the other on historical complexities of the Bosnian War), and two other novels.

The year 2000 was another turning point for Aralica: his party, HDZ, lost the elections and power, and writer was embroiled in a bitter polemic with new authorities (which were to hold power for the next four years). Aralica began writing satirical &quot;romans à clef&quot; (thinly disguised quasi-fiction). The most famous one is (&quot;Good for nothing&quot;) from 2002, a satirical-political attack on &quot;multi-culturalist ideology&quot; as promulgated by controversial American billionaire George Soros. The literary value of his works published during this period was often disputed, and they were seen by many left-wing literary critics (Perišić, Jergović, Tagirov, Alajbegović) as little more than tasteless political pamphlets. However, Aralica has also become one of the cultural and intellectual icons of nationalist conservatism in Croatia, advocating the return to the tradition symbolized by &quot;&quot; (&quot;hearth&quot;). Intellectuals on the political right defended his novels claiming that they were brilliant political satires.

<text>Second Nature is a long-form improvisational theatre troupe based in Los Angeles at the University of Southern California.

Second Nature was founded on November 19, 2002. The troupe performs every Thursday night in USC&#x27;s PED Building, providing free, comedic, one-hour shows. Second Nature regularly performs with other improv troupes from all over Los Angeles, and the United States. The collegiate troupe is known for the Fracas! Improv Festival, one of the largest intercollegiate improv comedy festivals in the world. Additionally, Second Nature pioneered The Facebook Show, an improvised comedy show based entirely on the Facebook profiles of audience volunteers.

Since its debut, Second Nature has become a regular part of campus life at USC, and has begun the careers of several comedians, actors, and directors.

== History ==
Second Nature was founded in 2002 by a group of USC students interested in performing improvised comedy. The troupe is a recognized student organization within the University of Southern California. The group chose the name Second Nature based on the idea that performing spontaneous theatre should become &quot;second nature&quot; to the cast.

The style of Second Nature&#x27;s comedy has changed with time, as the students have become more passionate and knowledgeable about improvisational theatre. Originally, Second Nature performed ComedySportz style shows, with the troupe split into two competing factions. After being influenced by The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and The Groundlings with whom the troupe had taken workshops, Second Nature adopted a more free flowing scenic style of improvisation. For the past few years, the troupe has been performing predominantly long-form improvisation, focusing on The Harold and The Armando, while occasionally performing other forms such as Text Message, The Town and The Bat.

Though Second Nature is fairly young, a number of professional performers began their careers with the troupe.

== The Fracas! Improv Festival ==
&quot;The Fracas! Improv Festival&quot;, or &quot;Fracas!&quot;, is an improvisational theatre festival created and hosted by Second Nature, and held annually at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 2004.

Over the past few years, Fracas! has grown into a national festival with more than a dozen participating universities, as well as workshops and panels with professionals from The Upright Citizens Brigade, The Groundlings, The Office, Mad TV, ImprovOlympic and more.

== The Facebook Show ==

Once a month, Second Nature performs &quot;Special Format Shows&quot; which contain either a special show format, or a special guest. As many special format shows are experimental, few receive a strong enough audience reaction to be performed multiple times. A notable exception is The Facebook Show.

The Facebook Show consists of three segments, roughly twenty minutes each. Each segment begins with an audience member volunteering to be interviewed by Second Nature. During the interview, the audience member logs on to their Facebook profile, which is projected on a screen, and explored in front of the live audience. Finally, Second Nature uses material from the volunteer&#x27;s Facebook profile as the basis for their improvisation.

Second Nature&#x27;s first Facebook Show was performed in 2005, when Facebook was open only to college students. However, since the social networking website has been opened up to the public, the show has become popular with a larger audience.

Influenced by Second Nature, other groups have begun performing the Facebook Show around the world, including at the University of California, Santa Barbara, by jericho! at the University of California, Berkeley, and in England by the Canterbury based troupe, Noise Next Door.

== Guest Monologists ==
One of the many show formats Second Nature performs is The Armando. This format - developed at ImprovOlympic - involves a guest monologist (frequently a celebrity) who uses a suggestion from the audience to inspire a truthful, personal monologue. The improvisers then use the monologue as inspiration for a series of scenes, which in turn inspire a response from the monologist.

Second Nature has performed The Armando with the following guest monologists:
*Dan Oster, &quot;MADtv&quot;
*Kate Flannery, &quot;The Office&quot;
*Paul Wolff, screenwriter, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, Little House on the Prairie, &quot;Home Improvement&quot; ; executive story-editor, Remington Steele
*Tom Lennon, &quot;Reno 911!, The State&quot;
*Will Sasso, &quot;MADtv&quot;
*Midori, prominent human sexuality writer, speaker, and sex educator
*Daniel Handler, aka Lemony Snicket, author of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;

== Current Cast ==
*Jor Abercrombie
*Dyanna Boone
*Dani Brown
*Eli Buettner
*Alannah Fredericks
*Ian Grady
*Olive Petty
*Pablo Rodriguez
*Liam Stephenson

<doc id="939500" wikidata="Q956201" url="?curid=939500" title="Lesser Slave Lake">
<text>Lesser Slave Lake is located in northern Alberta, Canada, northwest of Edmonton. It is the second largest lake entirely within Alberta boundaries (and the largest easily accessible by vehicle), covering and measuring over long and at its widest point. Lesser Slave Lake averages in depth and is at its deepest. It drains eastwards into the Athabasca River by way of the Lesser Slave River.

The town of Slave Lake is located at the eastern tip of the lake, around the outflow of Lesser Slave River.

== Conservation and development ==

Due to its location on a major fly-way for migrating birds, Lesser Slave Lake is popular with birders. The nearby Lesser Slave Lake Provincial Park has lakeside camping facilities located along sand beaches, with some rocky beaches as well. Fishing is popular and legal. The entire north shore of the lake is protected, other reserves being Hilliard&#x27;s Bay Provincial Park, &quot;Lesser Slave Lake Wildland&quot; and &quot;Grouard Trail Park Reserve&quot;.

Highway 2 and the Canadian National Railway follow the southern shore of the lake, and the Bicentennial Highway has its southernmost point at eastern end of the lake.

A number of Indian reserves are established at the shores of the lake:
*Kapawe&#x27;no First Nations Lands 150, 230 and 231 of the Kapawe&#x27;no First Nation, 
*Sucker Creek 150a of the Sucker Creek Cree First Nation
*Drift Pile River 150 of the Driftpile First Nation
*Swan River 150e of the Swan River First Nation 
*Sawridge 150g and h Sawridge Band

== Accidents ==
;February 14, 1968
On February 14, 1968, a Cessna 182H CF-WUK plane crashed into the lake due to ice forming on the wings and causing the pilot to lose control. The pilot was a Graham James Cox, a former 501 Squadron Commander during the Second World War. Both he and his two passengers died in the accident. The passengers were William Henry Lucus and Kenneth McIntosh McMillan.

;May 20, 2011
On May 20, 2011, a Bell 212 helicopter crashed into the lake while fighting the 2011 Slave Lake fire. The pilot, 54-year-old Jean-Luc Deba of Montreal, died. On the one-year anniversary, a park at Canyon Creek was named in Deba&#x27;s honor.

<text>AfterMASH is an American sitcom television series produced as a spin-off and continuation of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; that aired on CBS from September 26, 1983, to May 31, 1985. It was developed as the sequel series as it takes place immediately following the end of the Korean War and chronicles the postwar adventures of three main characters from the original series: Colonel Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan), Sergeant Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr) and Father John Mulcahy (William Christopher). 

Rosalind Chao rounded out the starring cast as Soon-Lee Klinger, a Korean refugee whom Klinger met, fell in love with, and married in the prior series finale &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;. &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; supporting cast-member Kellye Nakahara joined them, albeit off-camera, as the voice of the hospital&#x27;s public address system, and former &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; regular Gary Burghoff and recurring player Edward Winter made guest appearances as Radar O&#x27;Reilly and Colonel Samuel Flagg respectively.

&quot;AfterMASH&quot; was developed as a vehicle for Morgan, Farr, and Christopher (as they were the only main cast members of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; who wanted the series to continue beyond an eleventh season when a vote was taken prior to production of what was to be the final season of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;). The series was created by Larry Gelbart, who developed the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; series in which he was writer/showrunner for its first four seasons. Also involved with the production of &quot;AfterMASH&quot; were Burt Metcalfe (the only producer to stay with the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; during its entire run from 1972 to 1983) and writer/producers Ken Levine &amp; David Isaacs, who worked on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in its fifth to eighth seasons. 

The series was released to much fanfare but was later subjected to much retooling (including changes to its supporting cast, theme music, and timeslot) and suffered diminishing ratings before its cancellation in 1985 after only two seasons. 

Ken Levine later named &quot;AfterMASH&quot; when asked what was the worst thing he&#x27;d written, stating, &quot;It’s hard to top (or bottom) &quot;AfterMASH&quot;,&quot; before adding sarcastically, &quot;Take the three weakest characters of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, put them in the hilarious confines of a Veteran’s Hospital and you have a recipe for classic comedy.&quot; When Burt Metcalfe died in 2022, Levine - who described Metcalfe as &quot;the best boss I ever worked for. More like a father figure, role model, and mentor&quot; - wrote, &quot;When I am asked why we did &quot;AfterMASH&quot;, a big reason was the chance to work with Burt again. You just don’t meet wonderful quality people like that very often — especially in this industry. I would have happily signed aboard for &quot;After-AfterMASH&quot; if Burt were running it.&quot;

On the subject of &quot;AfterMASH&quot;, Larry Gelbart stated,

The show was far less than brilliant. I take full responsibility for its failure. If I hadn’t been so in love with the title, I might have thought out the show to go with it in a more objective way. I knew the series would inherit Potter, Mulcahy, and Klinger. I knew, too, that good as these people are, a leading player was going to be necessary. There was an attempt to build up a central character, a doctor who had lost his leg in Korea, and played wonderfully by David Ackroyd, but other attempts at making a show with its own tone, style and intent were not as successful. Probably, an hour show would have been a better format... Oh, well, you win some and you lose some (except on TV you lose in front of a whole lot of people).

==Synopsis==

===Season one===
In the one-hour pilot episode &quot;September of &#x27;53&quot;/&quot;Together Again&quot;, Colonel Potter returns home from South Korea to his wife Mildred (Barbara Townsend) in Hannibal, Missouri. He soon finds enforced retirement stifling, and Mildred suggests he return to work. Potter is soon hired by the bombastic and bureaucratic hospital administrator Mike D&#x27;Angelo (John Chappell) as the chief of staff at General Pershing Veterans&#x27; Hospital (&quot;General General&quot;), located in a fictional version of River Bend, Missouri.

After a delayed return from Korea to help his bride, Soon Lee, find her family, Max Klinger finds himself ostracized from his family (who did not approve of his marrying a Korean woman), and in trouble with the law in Toledo, Ohio. Potter writes to him, and offers him a job as his administrative assistant. Klinger&#x27;s nemesis at General General is D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s executive secretary Alma Cox (Brandis Kemp), a mean-spirited woman who is forever trying to &quot;get the goods&quot; on him, from rifling through his desk to giving him just one day to prepare for a civil service exam, the latter of which, despite her underhanded efforts, he still manages to pass.

Father Mulcahy, whose hearing was damaged in the final episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, is suffering from depression and drinking heavily. Potter arranges for him to receive an operation at another VA Hospital in St. Louis. After his hearing is surgically corrected, he stops drinking and joins Potter and Klinger at &quot;General General&quot; as its Catholic chaplain.

Also on hand is the idealistic, talented, and often hungry young resident surgeon Gene Pfeiffer (Jay O. Sanders), attractive secretary Bonnie Hornbeck (Wendy Schaal), who has her eye on Klinger, and old-timer Bob Scannell (Patrick Cranshaw), who served under then-Sergeant Potter in World War I and was now a hospital resident of 35 years (thanks to his exposure to mustard gas). Unlike the other patients and staff who address Potter by his retired rank of colonel, Scannell calls him &quot;Sarge&quot; at Potter&#x27;s request.

Halfway through the first season, Dr. Mark Boyer (David Ackroyd) was introduced as a hardened veteran who lost a leg in Korea and had a hard time adjusting to civilian life. Despite only having signed on for two episodes, his character began appearing more often toward the end of the season, so often that Dr. Pfeiffer was suddenly pulled from the cast after Dr. Boyer&#x27;s debut episode.

The only other main character from the original series to appear on &quot;AfterMASH&quot; was Radar (played by Gary Burghoff), who appeared in a first-season two-part episode. As Potter, Klinger, and Mulcahy prepare to head to Iowa for Radar&#x27;s wedding, Radar shows up in a panic at Potter&#x27;s house in Missouri, believing his fiancée has cheated on him in &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;. The Radar character later appeared in a pilot called &quot;W*A*L*T*E*R&quot;, in which Radar moves from Ottumwa, Iowa to St. Louis, after losing his farm, and his wife leaves him on his wedding night, and he becomes a police officer. (The series was never picked up, and the pilot was aired in July 1984 as a TV special on CBS exclusively in the Eastern and Central time zones; the show was pre-empted in Pacific and Mountain time zones by the 1984 Democratic National Convention. The pilot/special was broadcast by CBS only once.)

The season included home scenes with the Potters, most notably when they are deluged with guests in &quot;Thanksgiving of &#x27;53&quot;, and Potter tries to keep the phone occupied so Klinger cannot call his relatives, who are on their way over to surprise him; this episode also marked the only onscreen appearance of Potter&#x27;s oft-mentioned daughter, Evvy Ennis, and Potter&#x27;s grandson, Corey. One of the season&#x27;s standout episodes was the Emmy-nominated &quot;Fall Out&quot;, where Potter and Pfeiffer consider leaving General General, but reconsider when they link the leukemia seen in a patient with exposure to atomic testing; writer-director Larry Gelbart received a Peabody Award for this episode. The season closed in March, with Klinger being arrested for assaulting a real estate agent as the pregnant Soon-Lee goes into labor. In May, CBS announced the show was renewed for a second season.

===Season two===
Season two opened with Klinger escaping from the River Bend County Jail to attend the birth of his child and remaining a fugitive until a judge sends him to the psychiatric unit at General General, where Klinger feigns insanity to avoid prison, and the Potters take in Soon-Lee and the (as yet unnamed) baby. Mike D&#x27;Angelo is transferred to Montana and is replaced by smarmy new administrator Wally Wainwright (Peter Michael Goetz). Anne Pitoniak was brought in to replace Barbara Townsend as Mildred Potter. David Ackroyd was promoted to a regular cast member after multiple guest appearances in the second half of the first season. An attractive new psychiatrist, Dr. Lenore Dudziak (Wendy Girard), arrives to begin the daunting task of evaluating Klinger, while Potter is horrified that Wainwright has assigned Alma Cox as his new secretary.

==Relationship with &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;==

Only a few of the main and recurring characters from the original series were ever mentioned in the sequel series. Hawkeye was mentioned in a voice-over narration by Father John Mulcahy in the one-hour pilot episode. Major Frank Burns was mentioned two times by Colonel Sherman T. Potter, once in the first season episode &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; and another time in a second season episode. In a season 1 episode, &quot;Chief of Staff&quot;, Colonel Sherman T. Potter&#x27;s office was redecorated with all of the items from the 4077th MASH unit including a portrait from Season 10, Episode 21 of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Picture This&quot;, and it would remain that way throughout the sequel series. The theme song from the original series was also played. In a season 2 episode, &quot;Madness to His Method&quot;, Potter writes to Major Sidney Freedman, who had accepted a post at the University of Chicago after leaving Korea and the army, talking about the episode&#x27;s situation to an unseen character. Edward Winter, who played Colonel Samuel Flagg in the original series, reprised his role in a season 2 episode, &quot;Trials&quot;.

While &quot;AfterMASH&quot; was being produced and renewed for a second season, plans were made for Alan Alda and other actors from the original series to appear in the show as guest stars but it was canceled before the plans were finalized.

Ken Levine wrote in his &quot;By Ken Levine&quot; blog on February 8, 2022,

Way back in 1983 when David Isaacs and I were doing the iconic &quot;AfterMASH&quot; with Larry Gelbart we...wanted to build an ensemble that was not dependent on former &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; cast members. 

And that was fine except we started plunging in the ratings. All of a sudden the network and studio wanted ALL &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; characters brought back... and HURRY! 

Well Alan Alda and Mike Farrell were not remotely interested. Neither was David Ogden Stiers. We did manage to get Gary Burghoff to do an episode (which turned out to be one of our better episodes). 

But we were sitting in a meeting with 20th Century Fox executives. (The show was produced by 20th Century Fox.) One suit suggested we get Hot Lips back (like we hadn’t thought of that). We said we had approached Loretta Swit and she wasn’t interested. And then this honest-to-God exchange:

SUIT: Well, why does it have to be Loretta Swit?

ME: Excuse me?

SUIT: Just get another actress and say it’s Hot Lips.

ME: Are you serious?

SUIT: Yeah, why not? 
ME: Uh… Loretta Swit IS Hot Lips.

SUIT: Shows substitute actors all the time.
ME: But then it wouldn’t be a big event if we use another actress.

SUIT: Sure it would. Hot Lips is back. That’s all you gotta say.

ME: So we could get Diana Ross and say she’s Hot Lips?

SUIT: Say... that’s kinda interesting.

This is the kind of idiocy we have to deal with, and ya know what? It’s way worse now. Oh.. for the record — we did not approach Diana Ross. Or any of The Supremes. 

==Characters==
*Note: Similar to the list on the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; page, this table counts double episodes as two episodes, and therefore there are 22 episodes in the first season (with the first episode being double-length), and 9 episodes in the second season, the total being 31.

==Production==
===Writing===
&quot;AfterMASH&quot; made frequent references to &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, and likewise featured storylines that highlighted the horrors and suffering of war, from the non-combat perspective of a veterans&#x27; hospital. The series was canceled after twenty-nine broadcast episodes. &quot;Wet Feet&quot;, the thirtieth episode, was never aired.

===Broadcast===
&quot;AfterMASH&quot; premiered in late 1983 in the same Monday at 9 p.m. time slot as its predecessor, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. It finished at No. 15 out of 101 network shows for the 1983–1984 season according to Nielsen Media Research television ratings. For its second season, CBS moved the show to Tuesday nights at 8:00 p.m., opposite NBC&#x27;s Top 10 hit &quot;The A-Team&quot;, and launched a marketing campaign featuring illustrations by Sanford Kossin of Max Klinger in a female nurse&#x27;s uniform shaving off Mr. T&#x27;s signature mohawk, theorizing that &quot;AfterMASH&quot; would take a large portion of the &quot;A-Team&quot; audience. The opposite occurred, as &quot;AfterMASH&#x27;s&quot; ratings plummeted to near the bottom of the television rankings, leading to its cancellation just nine episodes into its second season, finishing at only No. 72 out of 77 shows for the 1984–1985 season. Meanwhile, &quot;The A-Team&quot; continued until 1987, with 97 episodes.

==Episodes==
===Series overview===
===Season 1 (1983–84)===
===Season 2 (1984–85)===
==Reception==
Critics were mostly negative about the program. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed the show as one of the 100 worst ideas of the century, and in 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed it as the seventh-worst TV series ever.

Writing for The A.V. Club in 2015, Noel Murray stated,

The failure of &quot;AfterMASH&quot; has been overstated a bit. Looking at it in retrospect, the show suffers from unflattering comparisons to &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and from the sour feelings of its creators, who fought with CBS executives over how best to “fix” a show that wasn’t terrible, just mediocre. (That’s another way that &quot;AfterMASH&quot; was like &quot;Joey&quot;, which also wasn’t as bad as its reputation now suggests.) The sitcom’s first season finished in the Top 15 in the year-end Nielsen ratings, and the episode “Fallout”—about cancer patients who’d been harmed by atomic testing—was nominated for an Emmy.

<doc id="939510" wikidata="Q629755" url="?curid=939510" title="River Colne, Hertfordshire">
<text>The Colne is a river and a tributary of the River Thames in England. Just over half its course is in south Hertfordshire. Downstream, it forms the boundary between Buckinghamshire and the London Borough of Hillingdon. The confluence with the River Thames is on the Staines reach (above Penton Hook Lock) at Staines-upon-Thames.

Two of its distributaries, constructed in the 1600 – 1750 period largely for aesthetic reasons for Hampton Court and for Syon Park, have been maintained. Their main purpose was not drinking water but these can be likened to the New River in scale and in date. Crossing its route, many viaducts and a canal, the intersecting Grand Union Canal, have been recognised for pioneering engineering during the Industrial Revolution.

Digging for gravel and clay along its lower course near Rickmansworth has created a belt of flooded pits below the water table, as established lakes, many of which are well-adapted habitats for wildlife, protected as nature reserves. The river, meadows and lakes form the Colne Valley regional park covering .

==Route==
The Colne becomes universally so-named after two close subterranean streams converge at a spring, or in very wet weather in the meadows above, all along the east side (Tollgate Road) of North Mymms Park in Hertfordshire. The source streams are long, multi-source, in final, northern stages, partly underground tributaries: a north-eastern, which can be considered the upper Colne; and the Mimmshall Brook. Their main sources are : in western Northaw, Brookmans Park, Hadley, London and Borehamwood, draining much of those places. A seasonal, intra-parochial stream runs under the seven-building village of North Mymms draining most of the park, which, with adjoining woods is a small square plateau, sloping down to its corners except the south-west.
Shallow swallow holes of the two brooks are in North Mymms&#x27; Water End, centred on so-named combined surface flow. From the Water End Swallow Holes the Colne runs west, longer NNW, then west then receives the Ellen Brook and turns SSW, then meanders south-west, bounding central and residential Watford and Oxhey, also bounding Rickmansworth and Batchworth, then for a similar total stretch bounding Greater London (and Spelthorne), east and (through anabranch ditches) Buckinghamshire, west. Specifically, it passes between West Hyde, near Maple Cross, and Harefield, passes Denham Green then passes Uxbridge, where it parallels the Grand Union Canal and its first main anabranch, the Frays River which is co-fed by the Pinn between Cowley and Yiewsley, Greater London. The Colne Brook splits off as a distributary between New Denham and Uxbridge. After this, at West Drayton, the Frays rejoins and the Wraysbury River, the second main anabranch, and Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s River divide off.

Soon after, at Longford, the intake is given to the Longford River, a artificial channel created in 1610 for King Charles I to supply the water features in Bushy Park and the rectangular lakes in Hampton Court Park.

The Colne&#x27;s drainage basin extends almost as far north again as its northern limit – the inflowing Gade, Ver and Misbourne extend well into the Chilterns. Opposite, the other of outer west and north-west London is drained by the Pymmes Brook, Brent, or Crane sub-basins of the Thames. In the north-west, centred on Tring&#x27;s northern boundary the Chiltern ridge is most noticeable, a watershed of this basin and that of the River Great Ouse, north and east towards the Wash.

=== Eponymous settlements and indirect reference within a district name ===
The villages of Colney Heath east of St Albans, London Colney south of St Albans, Colney Street (almost wholly a large business park) north of Radlett and Colnbrook between Slough and Heathrow take their name from the river. Three Rivers District Council covers part of Hertfordshire and is named after the River Colne and its two tributaries, the River Chess and the River Gade.

=== Use of valley and river for navigation ===

Among early proposals to link the river to London was one in 1641 by Sir Edward Forde for a navigable canal, the main purpose of which seems to have been the supply of clean water, and two in 1766, for canals from Marylebone to the river at Uxbridge and another from Marylebone to West Drayton.

The river underwent considerable change in the 1790s, when the Grand Junction Canal (which became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929) was routed along the valley and still takes the river channel for part of its course. Construction began from Brentford, where it used for the channel of the River Brent, and progressed westwards then northwards, with it reaching Uxbridge in November 1794. To reach the Midlands it continued along the river channel until its junction with the River Gade, which it ran parallel to, but did not take over the channel. The Slough Arm was built in 1882 which required three aqueducts to carry it close to its junction with the Grand Junction, to cross the Fray&#x27;s River, the River Colne and the Colne Brook.

Between Croxley Green, where the River Gade joins the Colne, and Thorney/West Drayton, below the Slough Arm, the river channels thread their way between many large lakes, some of which were once watercress beds, some chalk pits, and some of which were the result of brickmaking, an industry that developed over several miles of the valley after 1800, when the Grand Junction Canal company advertised the presence of good brick earth, discovered during the construction of the canal.

== Structures ==

There are two London Coal Duty markers beside the river, which mark points at which duty became payable on coal entering the London area. The first is on the north side of the river in Colney Heath Local Nature Reserve, and is a square-section cast iron pillar made by Henry Grissell at his Regents Canal ironworks and erected in 1861 or 1862. It is high and is painted white. The second is a stone obelisk, high, with a square base, which was erected at Colne Bridge in 1861. It was moved from its original position to the other side of the river in 1984 when it was repaired by Watford Borough Council. It is close to the five-arched Colne Viaduct, which was built in 1837 to carry the London to Birmingham Railway over the river. Each of the arches spans around and is high. The structure was designed by Robert Stephenson, and is grade II listed.

At London Colney, there is a seven-arched brick bridge which carries Barnet Road over the river. It dates from 1774 and is called Telford&#x27;s Bridge, although it is not thought to have been designed by Thomas Telford. It was modified in the 20th century when parapets and railings were added.

There was a long-running dispute over water levels in the Batchford area, following the construction of the Grand Junction Canal, which were resolved in 1825, when an obelisk was erected in a pond, to act as a water gauge. The obelisk records the agreement made between the canal company, John Dickinson who was the owner of papermills at Batchworth, and R. Williams of Moor Park, who was the landowner.

<text>The War Relocation Authority (WRA) was a United States government agency established to handle the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. It also operated the Fort Ontario Emergency Refugee Shelter in Oswego, New York, which was the only refugee camp set up in the United States for refugees from Europe. The agency was created by Executive Order 9102 on March 18, 1942, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was terminated June 26, 1946, by order of President Harry S. Truman.

==Formation ==
After the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing military commanders to create zones from which certain persons could be excluded if they posed a threat to national security. Many people of Japanese ancestry were also suspected of espionage after the Pearl Harbor attack. Military Areas 1 and 2 were created soon after, encompassing all of California and parts of Washington, Oregon, and Arizona, and subsequent civilian exclusion orders informed Japanese Americans residing in these zones they would be scheduled for &quot;evacuation.&quot; The executive order also applied to Alaska as well, bringing the entire United States West Coast as off-limits to Japanese nationals and Americans of Japanese descent.

On March 18, 1942, the WRA was formed via Executive Order 9102. It was in many ways a direct successor to the Works Projects Administration (WPA) and the efforts of both overlapped and intermingled for quite some time. From March until November, the WPA spent more on internment than any other agency including the Army and was on the scene with removal and relocation even before Executive Order 9192. Beginning on March 11, for example, Rex L. Nicholson, the WPA&#x27;s regional director, managed the first “Reception and Induction” centers. Another WPA veteran, Clayton E. Triggs, was the administrator the Manzanar Relocation Center, a facility which, according to one insider, was “manned just about 100% by the WPA.” Drawing on his background in New Deal road construction, Triggs installed such familiar concentration camp features as guard towers and spotlights. As the WPA wound down in late 1942 and early 1943, many of its employees moved over seamlessly to the WRA.

Milton S. Eisenhower was the WRA&#x27;s original director. Eisenhower was a proponent of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and disapproved of the idea of mass internment. Early on he had tried, unsuccessfully, to limit the internment to adult men, allowing women and children to remain free, and he pushed to keep WRA policy in line with the original idea of making the camps similar to subsistence homesteads in the rural interior of the country. This, along with proposals for helping Japanese Americans resettle in labor-starved farming communities outside the exclusion zone, was met with opposition from the governors of these interior states, who worried about security issues and claimed it was &quot;politically infeasible,&quot; at a meeting in Salt Lake City in April 1942. Shortly before the meeting Eisenhower wrote to his former boss, Secretary of Agriculture Claude Wickard, and said, &quot;when the war is over and we consider calmly this unprecedented migration of 120,000 people, we as Americans are going to regret the unavoidable injustices that we may have done&quot;.

Disappointed, Eisenhower was director of the WRA for only ninety days, resigning June 18, 1942. However, during his tenure with the WRA he raised wages for interned Japanese Americans, worked with the Japanese American Citizens League to establish an internee advisory council, initiated a student leave program for college-age Nisei, and petitioned Congress to create programs for postwar rehabilitation. He also pushed Roosevelt to make a public statement in support of loyal Nisei and attempted to enlist the Federal Reserve Bank to protect the property left behind by displaced Japanese Americans, but was unable to overcome opposition to these proposals. Eisenhower was replaced by Dillon S. Myer, who would run the WRA until its dissolution at the end of the war.

Japanese Americans had already been removed from their West Coast homes and placed in temporary &quot;assembly centers&quot; (run by a separate military body, the Wartime Civilian Control Administration [WCCA]) over the spring of 1942; Myer&#x27;s primary responsibility upon taking the position was to continue with the planning and construction of the more permanent replacements for the camps run by the WCCA.

==Selection of camp sites==
The WRA considered 300 potential sites before settling on a total of ten camp locations, mostly on tribal lands. Site selection was based upon multiple criteria, including:
*Ability to provide work in public works, agriculture, manufacturing.
*Adequate transportation, power facilities, sufficient area of quality soil, water, and climate
*Able to house at least 5,000 people
*Public land

The camps had to be built from the ground up, and wartime shortages of labor and lumber combined with the vast scope of each construction project (several of the WRA camps were among the largest &quot;cities&quot; in the states that housed them) meant that many sites were unfinished when transfers began to arrive from the assembly centers. At Manzanar, for example, internees were recruited to help complete construction.

==Life in the camps==
Life in a WRA camp was difficult. Those fortunate enough to find a job worked long hours, usually in agricultural jobs. Resistance to camp guards and escape attempts were a low priority for most of the Japanese Americans held in the camps. Residents were more often concerned with the problems of day-to-day life: improving their often shoddily-constructed living quarters, getting an education, and, in some cases, preparing for eventual release. Many of those who were employed, particularly those with responsible or absorbing jobs, made these jobs the focus of their lives. However, the pay rate was deliberately set far lower than what inmates would have received outside camp, an administrative response to widespread rumors that Japanese Americans were receiving special treatment while the larger public suffered from wartime shortages. Non-skilled labor earned $14/month while doctors and dentists made a paltry $19/month.

Many found consolation in religion, and both Christian and Buddhist services were held regularly. Others concentrated on hobbies or sought self-improvement by taking adult classes, ranging from Americanization and American history and government to vocational courses in secretarial skills and bookkeeping, and cultural courses in such things as ikebana, Japanese flower arrangement. The young people spent much of their time in recreational pursuits: news of sports, theatrics, and dances fills the pages of the camp newspaper.

Living space was minimal. Families lived in army-style barracks partitioned into &quot;apartments&quot; with walls that usually did not reach the ceiling. These &quot;apartments&quot; were, at the largest, and were expected to house a family of six. In April 1943, the Topaz camp averaged (roughly ) per person.

Each inmate ate at one of several common mess halls, assigned by block. At the Army-run camps that housed dissidents and other &quot;troublemakers&quot;, it was estimated that it cost 38.19 cents per day ($ in present-day terms) to feed each person. The WRA spent slightly more, capping per-person costs to 50 cents a day ($ in present-day terms) (again, to counteract rumors of &quot;coddling&quot; the inmates), but most people were able to supplement their diets with food grown in camp.

The WRA allowed Japanese Americans to establish a form of self-governance, with elected inmate leaders working under administration supervisors to help run the camps. This allowed inmates to keep busy and have some say in their day-to-day life; however, it also served the WRA mission of &quot;Americanizing&quot; the inmates so that they could be assimilated into white communities after the war. The &quot;enemy alien&quot; Issei were excluded from running for office, and inmates and community analysts argued that the WRA pulled the strings on important issues, leaving only the most basic and inconsequential decisions to Nisei leaders.

==Community Analysis Section==
In February 1943, the WRA established the Community Analysis Section (under the umbrella of the Community Management Division) in order to collect information on the lives of incarcerated Japanese Americans in all ten camps. Employing over twenty cultural anthropologists and social scientists—including John Embree, Marvin and Morris Opler, Margaret Lantis, Edward Spicer, and Weston La Barre—the CAS produced reports on education, community-building and assimilation efforts in the camps, taking data from observations of and interviews with camp residents.

While some community analysts viewed the Japanese American inmates merely as research subjects, others opposed the incarceration and some of the WRA&#x27;s policies in their reports, although very few made these criticisms public. Restricted by federal censors and WRA lawyers from publishing their full research from the camps, most of the (relatively few) reports produced by the CAS did not contradict the WRA&#x27;s official stance that Japanese Americans remained, for the most part, happy behind the barbed wire. Morris Opler did, however, provide a prominent exception, writing two legal briefs challenging the exclusion for the Supreme Court cases of Gordon Hirabayashi and Fred Korematsu.

==Resettlement program==
Concerned that Japanese Americans would become more dependent on the government the longer they remained in camp, Director Dillon Myer led the WRA in efforts to push inmates to leave camp and reintegrate into outside communities. Even before the establishment of the &quot;relocation centers,&quot; agricultural laborers had been issued temporary work furloughs by the WCCA, and the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council had been placing Nisei in outside colleges since the spring of 1942. The WRA had initiated its own &quot;leave permit&quot; system in July 1942, although few took the trouble to go through the bureaucratic and cumbersome application process until it was streamlined over the following months. (By the end of 1942, only 884 had volunteered for resettlement.)

The need for a more easily navigable system, in addition to external pressure from pro-incarceration politicians and the general public to restrict who could exit the camps, led to a revision of the application process in 1943. Initially, applicants were required to find an outside sponsor, provide proof of employment or school enrollment, and pass an FBI background check. In the new system, inmates had only complete a registration form and pass a streamlined FBI check. (The &quot;loyalty questionnaire,&quot; as the form came to be known after it was made mandatory for all adults regardless of their eligibility for resettlement, would later spark protests across all ten camps.)

At this point, the WRA began to shift its focus from managing the camps to overseeing resettlement. Field offices were established in Chicago, Salt Lake City and other hubs that had attracted Japanese American resettlers. Administrators worked with housing, employment and education sponsors in addition to social service agencies to provide assistance. Following Myer&#x27;s directive to &quot;assimilate&quot; Japanese Americans into mainstream society, this network of WRA officials (and the propaganda they circulated in camp) steered resettlers toward cities that lacked large Japanese American populations and warned against sticking out by spending too much time among other Nikkei, speaking Japanese or otherwise clinging to cultural ties. By the end of 1944, close to 35,000 had left camp, mostly Nisei.

==Resistance to WRA policies==
The WRA&#x27;s &quot;Americanization&quot; efforts were not limited to the Nisei resettlers. Dillon Myer and other high-level officials believed that accepting the values and customs of white Americans was the best way for Japanese Americans to succeed both in and out of camp. Administrators sponsored patriotic activities and clubs, organized English classes for the Issei, encouraged young men to volunteer for the U.S. Army, and touted inmate self-government as an example of American democracy. &quot;Good&quot; inmates who toed the WRA line were rewarded, while &quot;troublemakers&quot; who protested their confinement and Issei elders who had been leaders in their prewar communities but found themselves stripped of this sway in camp were treated as a security threat. Resentment over poor working conditions and low wages, inadequate housing, and rumors of guards stealing food from inmates exacerbated tensions and created pro- and anti-administration factions. Labor strikes occurred at Poston, Tule Lake and Jerome, and in two violent incidents at Poston and Manzanar in November and December 1942, individuals suspected of colluding with the WRA were beaten by other inmates. External opposition to the WRA came to a head following these events, in two congressional investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee and another led by Senator Albert Chandler.

The leave clearance registration process, dubbed the &quot;loyalty questionnaire&quot; by inmates, was another significant source of discontent among incarcerated Japanese Americans. Originally drafted as a War Department recruiting tool, the 28 questions were hastily, and poorly, revised for their new purpose of assessing inmate loyalty. The form was largely devoted to determining whether the respondent was a &quot;real&quot; American — baseball or &quot;judo&quot;, Boy Scouts or Japanese school — but most of the ire was directed at two questions that asked inmates to volunteer for combat duty and forswear their allegiance to the Emperor of Japan. Many were offended at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them, and believed the question of allegiance was an implicit accusation that they had been disloyal to the United States. Although most answered in the affirmative to both, 15 percent of the total inmate population refused to fill out the questionnaire or answered &quot;no&quot; to one or both questions. Under pressure from War Department officials, Myer reluctantly converted Tule Lake into a maximum security segregation center for the &quot;no-nos&quot; who flunked the loyalty test, in July 1943.

Approximately 12,000 were transferred to Tule Lake, but of the previous residents cleared as loyal, only 6,500 accepted the WRA offer to move to another camp. The resulting overpopulation (almost 19,000 in a camp designed for 15,000 by the end of 1944) fueled existing resentment and morale problems. Conditions worsened after another labor strike and an anti-WRA demonstration that attracted a crowd of 5,000 to 10,000 and ended with several inmates being badly beaten. The entire camp was placed under martial law on November 14, 1943. Military control lasted for two months, and during this time 200 to 350 men were imprisoned in an overcrowded stockade (held under charges such as &quot;general troublemaker&quot; and &quot;too well educated for his own good&quot;), while the general population was subject to curfews, unannounced searches, and restrictions on work and recreational activities. Angry young men joined the &quot;Hoshi-dan&quot; and its auxiliary, the &quot;Hokoku-dan&quot;, a militaristic nationalist group aimed at preparing its members for a new life in Japan. This pro-Japan faction ran military drills, demonstrated against the WRA, and made threats against inmates seen as administration sympathizers. When the Renunciation Act was passed in July 1944, 5,589 (over 97 percent of them Tule Lake inmates) expressed their resentment by giving up their U.S. citizenship and applying for &quot;repatriation&quot; to Japan.

==End of the camps==
The West Coast was reopened to Japanese Americans on January 2, 1945 (delayed against the wishes of Dillon Myer and others until after the November 1944 election, so as not to impede Roosevelt&#x27;s reelection campaign). On July 13, 1945, Myer announced that all of the camps were to be closed between October 15 and December 15 of that year, except for Tule Lake, which held &quot;renunciants&quot; slated for deportation to Japan. (The vast majority of those who had renounced their U.S. citizenship later regretted the decision and fought to remain in the United States, with the help of civil rights attorney Wayne M. Collins. The camp remained open until the 4,262 petitions were resolved.) Despite wide-scale protests from inmates who had nothing to return to and felt unprepared to relocate yet again, the WRA began to eliminate all but the most basic services until those remaining were forcibly removed from camp and sent back to the West Coast.

Tule Lake closed on March 20, 1946, and Executive Order 9742, signed by President Harry S. Truman on June 26, 1946, officially terminated the WRA&#x27;s mission.

<text>Tierra templada (Spanish for &quot;temperate land&quot;) is a pseudo-climatological term used in Latin America to refer to places which are either located in the tropics at a moderately high elevation or are marginally outside the astronomical tropics, producing a somewhat cooler overall climate than that found in the tropical lowlands, the zone of which is known as the tierra caliente.

In countries situated close to the equator, the &quot;tierra templada&quot; typically has an elevation span of between . These thresholds become lower as the latitude increases. The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal used following altitudes:

*1,000 m as the border between the tropical rainforest and the subtropical cloud forest
*2,300 m as the end of the subtropical cloud forest (&quot;Yunga fluvial&quot;)
*3,500 m as the treeline
*4,800 m as the puna end

&quot;Tierra templada&quot; has mean average temperature between . Coffee is grown extensively as a cash crop, with grains such as wheat and corn being cultivated for subsistence purposes - in contrast to the warmer &quot;tierra caliente&quot;, where tropical fruits predominate. Xalapa in Mexico is an example of a city that lies in the &quot;tierra templada&quot;, having a subtropical highland climate under the Köppen climate classification.

<text>A dirk is a long-bladed thrusting dagger. Historically, it gained its name from the Highland dirk (Scottish Gaelic ) where it was a personal weapon of officers engaged in naval hand-to-hand combat during the Age of Sail as well as the personal sidearm of Highlanders. It was also the traditional sidearm of the Highland Clansman and later used by the officers, pipers, and drummers of Scottish Highland regiments around 1725 to 1800 and by Japanese naval officers.

==Etymology==
The term is associated with Scotland in the Early Modern Era, being attested from about 1600. The term was spelled &quot;dork&quot; or &quot;dirk&quot; during the 17th century, presumed related to the Danish, Dutch and Swedish &quot;dolk&quot;, and the German &quot;dolch, tolch&quot;; from a West Slavic &quot;Tillich&quot;. The exact etymology is unclear. The modern spelling &quot;dirk&quot; is probably due to Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1755 &quot;Dictionary&quot;. The term is also used for &quot;dagger&quot; generically, especially in the context of prehistoric daggers such as the Oxborough dirk.

==Highland dirk==


The Scottish dirk (also &quot;Highland dirk&quot;, Scottish Gaelic: ), as a symbolic traditional and ceremonial weapon of the Highland Cathairean (cateran or warrior), is worn by officers, pipers and drummers of Scottish Highland regiments. The development of the Scottish dirk as a weapon is unrelated to that of the naval dirk; it is a modern continuation of the 16th-century ballock or rondel dagger.

The traditional Scottish dirk is a probable development from the 16th century but like all medieval societies, the Highlander needed a knife for everyday use. The dirk became symbolic of a Highland man’s honour and oaths were sworn on the steel which was believed to be holy. The following highlights the importance of the dirk in Highland culture:

The dirk occupies a unique niche in Highland culture and history. Many Highland Scots were too cash-poor to buy a sword, following the Disarming Acts enacted to erode Highland martial insurrections but virtually every male carried a dirk—and carried it everywhere! If in Japan the katana was the soul of the Samurai, in Scotland the dirk was the heart of the Highlander. In many warrior cultures oaths were sworn on one&#x27;s sword. Among the Gael, however, binding oaths with the force of a geas (involving dire supernatural penalties for breaking such an oath) were sworn on one&#x27;s dirk. The English, aware of this, used the custom against the Highlanders after Culloden: When Highland dress was prohibited in 1747 those Gael who could not read or sign an oath were required to swear a verbal oath, &quot;in the Irish (Scots Gaelic) tongue and upon the holy iron of their dirks&quot;, not to possess any gun, sword, or pistol, or to use tartan: &quot;... and if I do so may I be cursed in my undertakings, family and property, may I be killed in battle as a coward, and lie without burial in a strange land, far from the graves of my forefathers and kindred; may all this come across me if I break my oath.&quot;

During the period of proscription, only service in a British regiment permitted Highlanders to bear their traditional arms and dress. The 78th Fraser Highlanders, raised in 1757, wore full highland dress uniform; their equipment was described by Major-General James Stewart in 1780 as including a &quot;musket and broadsword, to which many soldiers added the dirk at their own expense.&quot;

When worn, the dirk normally hangs by a leather strap known as a &quot;frog&quot; from a dirk belt, which is a wide leather belt having a large, usually ornate buckle, that is worn around the waist with a kilt. Many Scottish dirks carry a smaller knife and fork which fit into compartments on the front of the sheath, and a smaller knife known as a sgian dubh is also worn tucked into the top of the hose when wearing a kilt.
==Naval dirk==

A thrusting weapon, the naval dirk originally functioned as a boarding weapon and as a functional fighting dagger. During the days of sail, midshipmen and officers wore dirks; the daggers gradually evolved into ceremonial weapons and badges of office. In the Royal Navy, the naval dirk is still presented to junior officers; the basic design of the weapon has changed little in the last 500 years.

The naval dirk (Polish: , Russian: ) became part of the uniform of naval officers and civilian officials in the Navy Ministry of the Russian Empire, and in the Soviet navy an element of the dress uniform of officers. Later, it became an element of other uniforms as well, e.g. of officers in the Russian and Polish army and air force and of the police forces in some countries.

In the United States, the dirk was introduced by Scottish immigrants in the 1700s. Dirks were originally a single-edged weapon. By 1745, however, the weapon was more commonly had a double-edged blade; this makes the dirk more or less synonymous with the dagger. Dirks were often made from old sword blades. In the nineteenth century dirks started to be made with a curved blade, but returned to a straight blade by the end of the century. Some were long enough to be considered a short sword.

<doc id="939519" wikidata="Q2542515" url="?curid=939519" title="Alien Adventure">
<text>Alien Adventure is a science fiction/slapstick comedy 3D film in IMAX format released in 1999 by nWave Pictures, written and directed by Ben Stassen. The movie was rated G (or the local equivalent) in most countries. It was the first fully digital feature-length film produced for a large-screen format.

==Plot==
An extraterrestrial humanoid species, the Glegoliths, are wandering through space in search of a new world. Encountering an unknown planet (which turns out to be Earth), the Glegolith leader Cyrillus sends two &quot;manned&quot; probes to the surface to determine if it is suitable for colonisation.

The scouts in the probes think they have arrived at a great city, but in fact they have arrived at a new amusement park that is not yet open to the public. They proceed to explore four amusement rides :
* Arctic Adventure (motion simulator ride in a freezing environment);
* Magic Carpet (a ride in an Arabian Nights-themed dungeon);
* Kid Coaster (a roller coaster set in a gigantic simulation of a child&#x27;s bedroom); and
* Aqua Adventure (an underwater-themed motion simulator ride, complete with animatronic sharks).

At each ride the Glegolith scouts become variously excited, frightened, frozen or violently ill, but end up having a lot of fun. On seeing this, Cyrillus decides that the new planet &quot;was too much fun&quot; and would destroy the fabric of his society, and orders his scouts to withdraw. The alien visitors depart Earth without actually making contact with humans.

==Production notes==
The exotic looking alien script seen in several places in this movie is actually the real Glagolitic alphabet. The name of the alien leader - Cyrillus - bears a resemblance to Saint Cyril, who invented the Glagolitic alphabet. Also, the language spoken by the aliens (which is never translated in the movie) is the Walloon language, a real dialect from Belgium, where the movie was produced. It is completely unrelated to the Glegolithic script. On the approach of the manned probes to the surface, the coastline appears to be that of California. The outdoor shots of the theme park are from a real French theme park, &quot;Parc Du Futuroscope&quot;.

==Reception==
Robert Koehler of Variety called it &quot;a sputtering vehicle for showcasing the Imax 3D format.&quot;

==Home media==
It was released on DVD in the US slingshot Home Entertainment and the UK Escapi x.c.q DVD.

<doc id="939529" wikidata="Q371022" url="?curid=939529" title="Hofmeister kink">
<text>The Hofmeister kink (German: Hofmeister-Knick) is an automotive design feature consisting of a rearward/forward angle near the base of the rearmost pillar. It is named for Wilhelm Hofmeister, who was BMW&#x27;s design chief from 1955 to 1970, though it appeared on other-brand cars made before Hofmeister&#x27;s tenure at BMW.

Among the first cars to feature this design element were some 1949-model 2-door cars made by General Motors, including the Cadillac Club Coupe, Buick Sedanette, and Chevrolet Fleetline (Buick and Oldsmobile had similar body styles), as well as the 1958 Lancia Flaminia Sport Zagato and the 1961 Lancia Flavia Coupé. 

The first BMWs to feature it were the BMW 3200 CS and the BMW 1500 shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1961 and was later named after then-BMW director of design, Wilhelm Hofmeister.

Although the Hofmeister kink is commonly associated with BMW vehicles, similar C-pillar kinks have appeared on cars of numerous brands for many years. The 1951 Kaiser shows a prominent Hofmeister kink. A Hofmeister kink can be seen on the Volkswagen Golf Mk1 of 1974, the Series II Fiat 127 of 1977, and the 1994 Chevrolet Impala SS.

<doc id="939533" wikidata="Q5354534" url="?curid=939533" title="Tierra fría">
<text>In Latin America, tierra fría (Spanish for &quot;cold land&quot;) are mountain locations where high elevation results in a markedly cooler climate than that encountered in the lowlands at a comparable latitude. The combination of low latitude and high altitude — typically between approximately 2,000 m (about 6,500 ft) and 3,500 m (about 11,500 ft)
in locations within 10° of the equator — produces a climate that falls into the same category as many oceanic climates found along the west coasts of the continents within the temperate zones — mild temperatures all year round, with monthly averages ranging from about 10°C (50°F) in the coldest months to about 18°C (64.4°F) in the warmest months (at places further poleward the range of altitudes where this climate exists becomes progressively lower). Common crops grown in the tierra fría are potatoes, wheat, barley, oats, corn, and rye.

Beyond the &quot;tierra fría&quot; is a region known as the &quot;suni&quot;, &quot;puna&quot;, or &quot;páramos&quot;; near the Equator this encompasses places with altitudes of between roughly 3,500 m (11,500 ft) and 4,500 m (15,000 ft), representing the treeline and the snow line respectively. Vegetation here resembles that found in the tundra of the polar regions. Still higher is the &quot;tierra nevada&quot;, where permanent snow and ice prevail. The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal (Altitudinal zonation) used following altitudes: 2,300 m (end of the Cloud forest or &quot;Yunga fluvial&quot;), 3,500 m (Treeline) and 4,800 m (Puna end).

Some of Latin America&#x27;s largest cities are found in the tierra fria, most notably Bogotá, Colombia, altitude 2,640 m, Mexico City, Mexico, altitude 2,240 m and Quito, Ecuador, altitude 2,850 m; all three cities are also the capitals of their respective countries.

Agriculture in the region resembles that which is conducted in valley areas in the temperate zones, featuring such crops as barley and potatoes.

<text>W*A*L*T*E*R is a 1984 American unsold television pilot for the third spin-off of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. It starred Gary Burghoff, who reprised his &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; character.

The episode chronicles the adventures of Corporal Walter &quot;Radar&quot; O&#x27;Reilly after he returns home from the Korean War. No longer calling himself &quot;Radar&quot;, he has moved away from Iowa after sending his mother to live with his aunt. Settling in St. Louis, Missouri, by the beginning of the series, he has become a police officer.

==Plot==
No longer using his army nickname &quot;Radar&quot;, Walter O&#x27;Reilly is now a rookie police officer living in St. Louis with his colleague and cousin Wendell Micklejohn. As they get ready for work they are watching the start of a television interview by Clete Roberts, who is following up with various former staff from the 4077th; the previous week Roberts had interviewed Hawkeye Pierce, and this week Walter&#x27;s interview was being televised. At the police department and through a store front window, Walter and Wendell catch bits of the interview, giving viewers of the pilot a chance to bridge the events of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;AfterMASH&quot; with &quot;W*A*L*T*E*R&quot;.

In flashbacks during the interview scenes, viewers learn that Walter had returned home to Iowa but failed at farming and was forced to sell the farm and livestock and then he sent his mother to live with his aunt. After marrying his bride in River Bend (as shown in an episode of &quot;AfterMASH&quot;), she left him for his best friend during their honeymoon in St. Louis. Having hit rock bottom, a wandering Walter went to a drug store to buy an overdose of sleeping pills (and aspirin, as sleeping pills gave him a headache), but the drugstore clerk, Victoria, dissuaded him and they became friends. Wendell then helped Walter get a job with the city police. Walter solves a dispute between two strippers, and gets his wallet back from a young would-be thief whose father was killed in Korea.

==Relationship with &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;==
In the pilot episode of &quot;W*A*L*T*E*R&quot;, only three main characters from the original series, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, Captain Benjamin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce, and Major Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan were mentioned by Walter O&#x27;Reilly. He had kept a photograph of all of his former Army buddies from the 4077th MASH unit in his wallet.

==Production==
===Timeline===
The episode takes place after the series finale of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, and a two-part guest appearance on &quot;AfterMASH&quot;, in which Radar was forced to leave the family farm.

===Broadcast difficulties===
Since the pilot was never picked up by CBS as a series, it was shown as a &quot;CBS Special Presentation&quot; on July 17, 1984. It was shown once in the Eastern and Central time zones of the United States, but pre-empted on the West Coast by &quot;CBS News&quot; coverage of the Democratic National Convention. This is the only known broadcast of the pilot.

<doc id="939536" wikidata="Q1009881" url="?curid=939536" title="Bontebok">
<text>The bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus) is an antelope found in South Africa, Lesotho and Namibia. &quot;D. pygargus&quot; has two subspecies; the nominate subspecies (&quot;D. p. pygargus&quot;), occurring naturally in the Fynbos and Renosterveld areas of the Western Cape, and the blesbok (&quot;D. p. phillipsi&quot;) occurring in the Highveld.

The bontebok is related to the common tsessebe.

==Description==

The bontebok is a tall, medium-sized antelope. They typically stand high at the shoulder and measure along the head and body. The tail can range from . Body mass can vary from . Males are slightly larger and noticeably heavier than females. The bontebok is a chocolate brown colour, with a white underside and a white stripe from the forehead to the tip of the nose, although there is a brown stripe across the white near the eyes in most blesbok. The bontebok also has a distinctive white patch around its tail (hence the Latin name), while this patch is light brown/tan in the blesbok. The horns of the bontebok are lyre-shaped and clearly ringed. They are found in both sexes and can reach a length of half a metre.

==Habitat==
Blesbok live in the Highveld, where they eat short grasses, while bontebok are restricted to the coastal Fynbos and the Renosterveld. They are diurnal, though they rest during the heat of the day. Herds may contain only males, only females, or be mixed, and do not exceed 40 animals for bontebok or 70 for blesbok.
==Behavior==

Bontebok are not good jumpers, but they are very good at crawling under things. Mature males form territories and face down other males in displays and occasionally fight them.

==Conservation==
Bontebok were once extensively killed as pests, and by the early 20th century were reduced to a wild population of just 17 individuals. The species was saved from certain extinction when Dutch farmer Alexander van der Bijl corralled the remaining individuals into a fence, which they were unable to jump out of. In 1931, this herd of 17 was transferred to Bontebok National Park, which was established for the explicit purpose of conservation of the species. By the time the park was relocated to better suit the needs of the bontebok in 1961, the herd had grown to 61 members. Today, their population is estimated to range from 2,500 to 3,000, all descendants of the original herd of 17 members.

While Bontebok are extinct in their natural habitat, they have increased in population to the point where they are now very abundant and avidly farmed, because they are popular quarry for hunters and are easy to sustain.

== In culture ==
The bontebok is the provincial animal of Western Cape.

<doc id="939537" wikidata="Q1484093" url="?curid=939537" title="G-Taste">
<text>G-Taste is a Japanese erotic manga series written and illustrated by Hiroki Yagami and serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Magazine&quot; from 1996 to 2000, before being moved to &quot;Young Magazine Uppers&quot; from 2000 to 2004. The &quot;G&quot; in &quot;G-taste&quot; is used symbolically as the letter between &quot;F&quot; (for &quot;Fetish&quot;) and &quot;H&quot; (for &quot;hentai&quot;). The anime was originally licensed in the US by SoftCel Pictures; the rights have since expired and now Critical Mass has since bought the rights. Not all of the series has been licensed as only the first five episodes have been released in the US. Episodes 6 and 7 have, to date, not been released in the US at all. An additional single episode OVA was released in 2010 bundled with the &quot;G-Best - G-Taste Best Selection&quot; compilation manga from Kodansha.

The &quot;G-taste&quot; comics consist of a collection of four scene erotic vignettes, which typically each focus on a particular female character. Characteristically, they feature very little male involvement in sexual acts, which contributes to the voyeuristic atmosphere.

<doc id="939539" wikidata="Q1421448" url="?curid=939539" title="Fitzwilliam Virginal Book">
<text>The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book is a primary source of keyboard music from the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean periods in England, i.e., the late Renaissance and very early Baroque. It takes its name from Viscount Fitzwilliam who bequeathed this manuscript collection to Cambridge University in 1816. It is now housed in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge. The word virginals does not necessarily denote any specific instrument and might refer to any instrument with a keyboard.

==History==
It was given no title by its copyist and the ownership of the manuscript before the eighteenth century is unclear. At the time &quot;The&quot; &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot; was put together most collections of keyboard music were compiled by performers and teachers: other examples include &quot;Will Forster&#x27;s Virginal Book&quot;, &quot;Clement Matchett&#x27;s Virginal Book&quot;, and &quot;Anne Cromwell&#x27;s Virginal Book&quot;. It is possible that the complexities of typesetting music precluded the printing of much keyboard music during the late Renaissance and it was not until the advent of engraving music plates that pieces for keyboard were published. The first known example of this in England is &quot;Parthenia,&quot; which was published in &quot;c&quot;. 1612.

The FVB was once given the nomenclature of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Virginal Book&quot;, although the title cannot be correct since much of its contents were written after her death in 1603. 
Another hypothesis, which still has supporters, is that it belonged to Francis Tregian the Younger, a recusant and amateur musician. It has been argued that Tregian may have copied the entire collection while imprisoned in the period leading up to his death in 1614. The nature of Tregian&#x27;s contribution to the book has been disputed. Although other scholarship suggested that, as compiler, it is unlikely that Tregian was imprisoned long enough to undertake the copying involved, a closer inspection of the manuscript reveals two layers of copying, of which nos. 1-95 pieces form the first. This layer might have been done at any time previous to Tregian&#x27;s 1612 incarceration.

The manuscript includes music dating from approximately 1562 to 1612 by John Bull, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, Giles Farnaby (51 of whose 52 known pieces are included), Thomas Tallis, and Martin Peerson. Continental composers are also represented by the English composer in exile Peter Philips, whose music is largely arrangements of sacred music, madrigals and chansons. Other foreign composers are represented by, among others, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, the elusive Jehan Oystermayre and Giovanni Picchi. There are 298 pieces which includes the eighth variation of &#x27;Treg. Ground&#x27; (also Hugh Ashton&#x27;s Ground in &quot;My Ladye Nevells Booke&quot;) as a separate piece. It is found under a flap on which has written no. 276, &#x27;Pescodd Time&#x27; and it is assumed that Tregian either did not recognise the variation or thought it worthy of inclusion; as it happens, it is incomplete. As with many keyboard manuscripts of the time, the pieces were not written for a specific instrument, and most sound happily on all contemporary keyboard instruments, including virginals, harpsichord, clavichord and chamber organ. Many of the pieces in the book are short, and many of them are character pieces with droll and memorable titles, including &quot;Put Up Thy Dagger, Jemy&quot;, &quot;The New Sa-Hoo&quot;, and &quot;Quodlings Delight&quot; by Giles Farnaby; &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Gigge&quot;, by Richard Farnaby; &quot;Pakington&#x27;s Pownde&quot; and &quot;The Irishe Dumpe&quot; (anonymous); &quot;The Ghost&quot; and &quot;The Earle of Oxford&#x27;s Marche&quot; by William Byrd; &quot;Worster Braules&quot; by Thomas Tomkins; and the famous &quot;Lachrymae Pavan&quot; by John Dowland, as arranged by Giles Farnaby and by William Byrd.

In 1899, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel published an edition in two volumes (the Maitland Squire edition, see the Sources below) with only a basic critical commentary, which has been reprinted by Dover Publications and is available inexpensively. A microfilm facsimile of the manuscript is included in &quot;The music collections of the Cambridge libraries&quot; (Woodbridge, Conn. : Research Publications, 1991). Musica Britannica is preparing a volume dedicated to the &quot;Keyboard Music from Fitzwilliam Manuscripts&quot; . A new three-volume edition was published by Lyrebird Music in 2020, edited by renowned English music scholars Jon Baxendale and Francis Knights.

Richard Strauss used several selections from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book in his 1935 opera, &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot;, and cited them accordingly at their appearances in the work. They appear at ritualized moments in the action to provide commentary and atmosphere in the Act 2 marriage scene (No. XIV and No. XC) and in the Act 3 courtroom scene (No. XXXVII).

The first recording of selections from the anthology was made by Joseph Payne in 1964. It was issued by Vox Box (i.e. Vox Records) as a three-LP boxed set and features Payne performing three album sides on harpsichord (a modern Eric Herz instrument) and three sides on organ. Generally the more moderately paced and sustained pieces are performed on the organ.

<text>Kim Stockwood (born 11 November 1965) is a Canadian pop musician, singer and composer originally from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. She has recorded as a solo artist and also as a member of Atlantic Canadian music group Shaye with Damhnait Doyle and Tara MacLean.

==Career==
Stockwood began her music career in 1990 performing on folk nights at a local pub in St. John&#x27;s, where she grew up. Soon after she was playing weekend gigs, while retaining her day job. In 1992, she moved to Toronto in search of a record deal. There, she talked her way into the office of EMI president Mike McCarty, chatted for an hour, then sang two songs for him right there at his piano. She left that day with a publishing deal and had a full-fledged recording contract within five months.

Her first album, &quot;Bonavista&quot;, was released in 1995. With something of a country-rock feeling, the album was named after the town in Newfoundland where both her grandmother and her mother were born. Among the musicians who played on the album and co-wrote songs with her were Randy Bachman and Matthew Sweet. The album, however, did not initially receive a lot of attention; its first two singles didn&#x27;t catch on and sales were slow. After a record company executive heard Stockwood rehearsing a catchy, pop-rock-oriented song for an impending concert, the label decided to release &quot;Bonavista&quot; internationally in 1996 with two additional songs. One of them, &quot;Jerk,&quot; became an international hit, and eventually a top 10 hit on the Canadian pop chart. The repackaged album earned Stockwood a 1996 Juno Award nomination for best new artist and a SOCAN Award for pop song of the year (&quot;Enough Love&quot;).

In 1999, Stockwood released her second album, &quot;12 Years Old&quot;. The title track was a last-minute addition to the album, having been written with Abenna Frempong and Peter Vettese while the three of them were attending a songwriters&#x27; camp in Devon, England sponsored by EMI. The song became a Top 40 hit and was named single of the year at the 2000 East Coast Music Awards.

2002 saw Stockwood collaborate with close friends Tara MacLean and Damhnait Doyle to form the group Shaye, named after Tara Maclean&#x27;s sister Shaye Martirano, who died as the result of injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident.
Shaye&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Bridge&quot; (produced by Bill Bell and Jay Joyce) was released in 2003 on EMI Canada. The album features songs by Ron Hynes, Sinéad Lohan and Crash Vegas. Support for the album included shows in Canada and Japan. &quot;Happy Baby&quot; the lead single, was nominated for Single of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards. A second single, &quot;Beauty&quot;, made it into the top 20 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart.

The band&#x27;s 2006 followup, &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; was released on EMI Canada. It was exclusively available on iTunes in November 2006, then released physically in February 2007. The album features songs by Van Morrison, The Waterboys and Ron Sexsmith, among others. Twelve of the 13 tracks were produced by Jay Joyce, with one song produced by Bill Bell. The song &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; rose to number 13 on the charts in early 2007.

Tara MacLean left the band in 2007, and that was effectively the end of the road for Shaye, although the band did end up the subject of a four-part documentary aired on E! in Canada later that year.

In 2006, Stockwood released a Christmas CD called &quot;I Love Santa&quot;.

Apart from singing, she was part of the radio morning show team on Astral Media&#x27;s CJEZ-FM (97.3 EZ Rock) Toronto, with Humble Howard and Colleen Rusholme, from August 2008 to November 2009. She has also been a guest host on a variety of TV programs, including Saturday Night at the Junos, the Canadian Radio Music Awards, and the East Coast Music Awards.

In March 2011, Stockwood released her fourth studio album &quot;Back to the Water&quot;. It includes performances with fellow Shaye band member Damhnait Doyle, and Newfoundland bands The Once and The Dardanelles. The album won the East Coast Music Association Award for traditional recording of the year in 2011. CMT aired a TV special about Stockwood, also entitled &quot;Back to the Water&quot;, in March 2011.

On 20 October 2017, Stockwood released an EP featuring Bill King on piano entitled &quot;Sometimes The Moon&quot;. This project features six cover songs including the title track by her deceased mentor Ron Hynes.

==Personal life==
Stockwood is married to Allan Reid, who is the president and CEO of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS). They have two sons, Jack and Sam Reid.

<text>André Guignard is a Swiss engineer initially educated as a watchmaker. He is the creator of the mechanic of the Khepera, the S-bot and several other mobile robots.

Working at the LAMI of the EPFL with Professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud, he designed and realised in 1977 the first modern computer mouse, that started the successful Logitech diversification.

Born in 1942, he was enrolled at the EPFL in 1976 and made many research projects successful due to an exceptional mastering of how to conceive and build micromechanical systems. His interaction with students was always greatly appreciated. He retired in March 2007, but still helps part time with EPFL research projects.

==The Swiss Mouse==
Prototypes of an improved Engelbart mouse with an optical encoder were built at LAMI-EPFL in 1972, see EPFL mouse story but there was no need for a mouse when graphic screens were not available. The LAMI-EPFL developed several microprocessor driven graphic screens since 1974 and André Guignard designed in 1977 a reliable mechanism for measuring the ball movement with optical encoders. This was the first modern computer mouse using an optical encoder.
== Robots ==

===The Khepera===

A student project for a 5 cm diameter robot was redesigned in 1993 by André Guignard, 
Francesco Mondada and Edo. Franzi. After the first prototypes, the construction of this powerful small robot named Khepera from the scarab-looking Egyptian god Khepra was subcontracted to Forelec until K-Team SA foundation in 1996. The Khepera was sold to a thousand of research labs and hold the cover of Nature in its issue of August 31st, 2000, linked with the article of Michael J. B. Krieger, Jean-Bernard Billeter and Laurent Keller.

===The Robota Doll===
The Robota research objective of Prof Aude Billard is to engage in complex interaction with humans. In 1999, Prof Aude Billard was in need of a doll with moving legs and head. André Guignard built the mechanics, and added in 2005 moving eyes with a camera inside in the 8 cm diameter head. He helped students to build multi-degrees of liberty arms and necks.

===The S-bot (European project)===

The swarm-bots project was in need of a number of simpler, insect-like, robots (s-bots), built out of relatively cheap components, capable of self-assembling and self-organising to adapt to their environment. André Guignard interacted with Francesco Mondada and the other partners of the project and built 35 mechanically complex 15 cm in diameter s-bot robots that can grip each other to pass over an obstacle. The s-bot was ranked on position 39 in the list of “The 50 Best Robots Ever” (fiction or real) by the Wired magazine in 2006.

===Flying robot===
Jean-Christophe Zufferey PhD thesis was on bio-inspired autonomous flying. The 2006 smaller plane of the microflyer project flies in a 7x7m space. Based on the 5g microCeline of Didel, the 5 grams payload includes two linear cameras compacted by André Guignard and a tricky propeller gearbox in the middle of the fuselage, so the camera is in front. The propeller on top is a 0.2g anemometer measuring wind speed down to 0.1 m/s.

===Snake and salamander robots===
Prof. Auke Ijspeert is concerned about the neural mechanisms of movement control in vertebrates. André Guignard developed and built for him all the mechanics of the AmphiBot snake robots, as well as those of the Salamandra robotica salamander robot. One of the major difficulties building these amphibious robots was indeed their waterproofing.

<text>Tierra Helada (Spanish for &quot;frozen land&quot;), also known as Tierra Nevada (Spanish for &quot;snowy land&quot;), is a term used in Latin America to refer to the highest places found within the Andes mountains.

The &quot;Tierra Helada&quot; comprises the montane grasslands and shrublands, sunis, punas and páramos between the tree line and the snow line. The term &quot;tierra helada&quot; is accurate from a climatological standpoint, as its land is indeed &quot;frozen&quot;, situated above the snow line. In the northern Andes, the latter is located at an altitude of approximately 15,000 ft (or about 4,500 m).

The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal (Altitudinal zonation) used following altitudes: 
* as the border between the tropical rainforest and the subtropical cloud forest
* m as the end of the subtropical cloud forest (&quot;Yunga fluvial&quot;)
* m as the tree line
* m as the puna end

<doc id="939550" wikidata="Q702730" url="?curid=939550" title="Bude Canal">
<text>The Bude Canal was a canal built to serve the hilly hinterland in the Cornwall and Devon border territory in the United Kingdom, chiefly to bring lime-bearing sand for agricultural fertiliser. The Bude Canal system was one of the most unusual in Britain.

It was remarkable in using inclined planes to haul tub boats on wheels to the upper levels. There were only two conventional locks, in the short broad canal section near the sea at Bude itself. It had a total extent of , and it rose from sea level to an altitude of .

The design of the canal influenced the design of the Rolle Canal.

==Origins==
The coastal area at Bude has sand unusually rich in minerals, and the poor agricultural land of the locality was found to benefit considerably from application of the sand. In the pre-industrial age, actually transporting it was difficult, even to land relatively close to the coast.
Several schemes were put forward for canals to bring the sand to the countryside, and these proposals did not lack ambition. One early scheme, conceived by Cornish engineer John Edyvean, aimed at distributing Welsh coal from the port as far inland as Calstock on the River Tamar. It gained approval for construction in the (14 Geo. 3. c. 53), but financial problems and the Napoleonic Wars frustrated the proposal.
In 1818, the West Country canal engineer James Green produced a report for canal&#x27;s backers, and an act of Parliament, the (59 Geo. 3. c. lv), was obtained for this more moderate proposal in 1819. After some difficulties in the construction phase, the canal was completed, and opened on 8 July 1823. Its cost was £118,000.

==The canal system==
The project:
* improved the difficult exposed sea harbour at Bude;
* built a broad canal capable of taking barges for to Helebridge Basin;
* built the rest of the system for tub boats, long by wide;
* built a reservoir at Virworthy to feed water to the system.

The main line of the canal ran south east from Bude to Druxton Wharf near Launceston, with an easterly branch to Blagdonmoor, beyond Holsworthy. There was a northerly feeder arm leading from a new reservoir at Virworthy, now called Lower Tamar Lake.

There were two conventional locks in the short broad canal section, each with a vertical interval of . This section terminated at Helebridge, about from Bude, and ordinary coastal barges travelled this far up the canal.

The tub boats were designed to use the main part of the system, and they generally made the transit from the harbour at Bude, or from Helebridge if trans-shipping from coastal vessels there.

After Helebridge, there were three inclined planes to the summit section; the whole of the central part of the system was at this level, above sea level. The main line to Druxton Wharf, near Launceston, negotiated three descending inclined planes as it followed the southerly course of the River Tamar.

With no intermediate locks on the tub boat sections, the canal had to follow the contours between the inclined planes, and this made its route even more circuitous than most canals. However, some relatively ambitious viaducts and earthworks were constructed, particularly where side streams and small valleys entered the main watercourse and its valley.

==The inclined planes==

The unusual feature of the canal was the six inclined planes. The tub boats had wheels, and on the inclined planes they were pulled up the slopes with the wheels running in channel rails (like a squat letter &quot;U&quot; in section). There were two sets of rails, one for each direction, but it does not appear that a counterbalancing system was used (in which a boat coming down would balance one being pulled up).

The tub boats were hauled up and let down the inclined planes by chains, which were operated in most cases by waterwheels; the transit took five minutes or so. There were standby steam engines at some of the inclined planes. However the Hobbacott Inclined Plane (both the steepest and that allowing the greatest height difference) used a different system of harnessing water power: water filled a very large bucket, and it was simply the weight of the water that pulled the ascending tub boat up the incline. The bucket operated in a deep vertical shaft, and at the bottom a plug was opened and the water ran to waste along an adit which connected to the lower level of the canal; the descending bucket pulled an empty bucket up in the same operation. The full bucket had to be heavy enough to pull a loaded tub boat up the 1 in 4 gradient as well as overcoming friction, and Green calculated that a weight of about fifteen tons was necessary. This was successful, and the bucket raised a boat up the plane in about four minutes, which was about one half of the time taken when the standby steam engine was used.


The gradients of the planes differed somewhat, with Hobbacott being the steepest at 1 in 4.5 and Vealand being the gentlest at 1 in 8.6.

==Tub boats==
The tub boats were long and wide, and carried about 20 tons payload; the usage of tub boats was not confined to the Bude Canal. They were commonly operated by coupling between 4 and 6 together and hauling them – by horse power – together. A &quot;train&quot; of boats could therefore be long, and on the very sinuous alignment of the canal, the train must have been difficult to pass round sharp curves. Steering was possible by manually altering the connection between adjacent boats, using handspikes.

Each boat had four wheels in diameter for running on the inclined planes; the boats were hauled up and down individually.

The operation of lining the tub boats up with the rails, at transfer from canal to plane, must have been difficult. Once engaged with the continuous chain, it would have been impracticable to stop the motion momentarily while the wheels were guided to the rail channels; but no record is available as to how this was achieved.

==Operation==

On completion of the canal, the owning company was constantly short of cash, and inevitably income did not reach the levels predicted at the stage of promoting the canal. In addition, serious problems with the state of the newly finished works were discovered, although in the circumstances of a locally promoted scheme with novel technological aspects, the canal as built was better engineered than it might have been. The chains on the inclined planes were constantly breaking, the rails broke, and other mechanical failures were frequent, and physical damage from careless boat handling was also common.

However, the rich sand was successfully carried to farms near the various wharves in large quantities, and other merchandise was also carried, particularly coal from South Wales. Traffic picked up in the 1880s, and when the London and South Western Railway reached Holsworthy, the canal carried significant volumes of the sand to Stanbury Wharf for onward conveyance by railway; the mile or so between the wharf and the railway station must have been negotiated by horse and cart.

Nonetheless, the arrival of the railway soon spelt the ultimate doom of the canal: manufactured fertilisers had become commonplace and cheap, and they could be brought in by railway, so that the demand for the local sand was diminished considerably.

When it became obvious that the canal could not survive, some directors proposed obtaining parliamentary authority for abandonment, or selling the canal outright to the railway company, or anyone else. However, legal conditions agreed at the time of construction gave certain landowners rights to take water from the canal, and they would not give up these rights without compensation, so for the time being the proposals for disposal were frustrated. Finally, abandonment of the tub boat operation took place on 14 November 1891, with the Launceston main line and the Holsworthy branch being abandoned, but the Feeder arm continuing to be kept open because of the water rights. After protracted negotiations, the remainder of the canal was bought by Stratton and Bude Urban District Council, on 1 January 1902, and this enabled them to supply domestic water in due course to the villages in the district from the canal&#x27;s Tamar reservoir. The works became the responsibility of North Cornwall District Council when English local government was reorganised in 1974.

==The canal today==

Today the sea lock is still in working order, and the canal is &#x27;in water&#x27; as far as the base of the first inclined plane. The sea lock, though, is the only lock on this section still in working order, so that navigation is not possible along the whole network. Much of the upper section has been ploughed over or has become overgrown, but it is possible to see many remaining signs of the canal&#x27;s presence, in bridges and wharf buildings. On the feeder branch and on the lower part of the Launceston main line, the alignment is indicated on current Ordnance Survey maps. In most cases, the alignment is not open to the public, however.

An exhaustive list of locations where the canal&#x27;s remains can be seen may be found in Harris and Ellis.

==Plans for restoration==

In 2005 major plans were approved to re-develop the canal, including renewal of the two locks between the sea lock and the first inclined plane. £3.8 million in funding for this project was provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Objective One and the South West Regional Development Agency. Most of the planned projects were completed by 31 March 2009, which was also the date on which North Cornwall District Council ceased to exist: the partners in the project expressed the hope that the new Unitary Authority would complete the three unfinished elements: raising Rodd&#x27;s bridge, providing slipways at each end of the canal, and re-connecting it to Helebridge Wharf.

One element of the restoration was a number of wooden sculptures by Daniel Sodhi-Miles. These are inscribed with Cornish words and phrases, and take the form of chains or parts of chains, recalling the canal&#x27;s boating history.

==March 2008 damage ==
On Monday 10 March 2008, a powerful storm wrenched one of the lock gates off its fixings. Contractors removed the gate the following morning, and four-tonne concrete pipes were placed in the canal basin to dissipate the power of waves coming in from the sea. A temporary dam was constructed at Falcon Bridge, and a team of anglers and staff from the Environment Agency rescued the fish population before it was swept out to sea. Beyond the dam, the loss of water was contained, with levels only dropping by about , but at the lower end of the canal water continued to flow out until it was practically empty, revealing some interesting finds in the mud, including a shotgun.

The North Cornwall District Council used the opportunity to repair the canal walls and dredge the basin. During the course of the dredging, over of silt were removed. It was originally intended to refill the basin gradually after 8 July 2008, but a period of intense rainfall prior to that date resulted in a surge of water passing down the canal, which damaged the coffer dam protecting the empty section from the watered section. Consequently, the basin refilled in a single day.

<text>Japantown (Japanese: 日本町; &quot;Nihonmachi&quot;), commonly known as J Town, is a historic cultural district of San Jose, California, north of Downtown San Jose. Historically a center for San Jose&#x27;s Japanese American and Chinese American communities, San Jose&#x27;s Japantown is one of only three Japantowns that still exist in the United States, alongside San Francisco&#x27;s Japantown and Los Angeles&#x27;s Little Tokyo.

==History==
Japantown originally formed as a site for boardinghouses for Japanese men, just west of the 1887 &quot;Heinlenville&quot; Chinatown settlement, which was the block bounded by Sixth, Seventh, Taylor, and Jackson Streets.

Initially the residents of Japantown were mostly male, attracted by farming or general labor jobs. In the early 20th century, more women began to arrive as picture brides. As families began, local businesses were started to serve everyday needs for food and clothing. The local Japantown Asahi baseball club defeated the visiting Tokyo Giants in 1935.

By 1941, there were 53 businesses in Japantown. During World War II, the Japanese American population was forcibly removed from Japantown and unjustly incarcerated in camps. On their return after the war, many resettled in the area.

The upward mobility of the children and grandchildren of the original immigrants to San Jose, along with the expansion and growth of Silicon Valley caused many Japanese-Americans to leave the area for the suburbs, but the culture of this community remains in the businesses and festivals serving locals and tourists.

Japantown is home to many traditional Japanese restaurants. The California State Legislature mentioned this area as one of the last three remaining historical Japantowns in the United States.

In 2004, nearly 227,000 people resided within a radius of Japantown, of which 25% were of Asian descent.

==Japanese culture==

Japantown is the site of the Japanese American Museum of San Jose, which moved into a new building in 2010; San Jose Taiko, Shuei-do Manju Shop, whose manjū were specifically requested during the 1994 visit of the Emperor of Japan; Nichi Bei Bussan, founded in San Francisco in 1902 by the father of prominent local businessman Dave Tatsuno and relocated to San Jose after Tatsunos were interned, transformed from a general merchant to an Asian goods gift shop; and a variety of restaurants, professional services, community organizations (for example Yu-Ai Kai Senior Center, and the Japanese American Citizens League) and small retail shops. Japantown had two hand-made tofu shops, the last closing in 2017.

Two churches founded by Japanese over 100 years ago, Wesley United Methodist Church and San Jose Buddhist Church Betsuin, thrive on the same street, Fifth Street. They are home to many of the local community organizations including active Girl and Boy Scout organizations, and host several of Japantown&#x27;s largest cultural festivals.

Japantown&#x27;s Fifth Street now also leads to the new San Jose City Hall. Indeed, the Fifth and Jackson Landmark was designed to be seen from City Hall as a beacon and reminder of the people that have helped build the city. The Fifth and Jackson Landmark is part of a larger California Japantown Landmarks Project to create powerful and emotional permanent outdoor exhibits, including monuments in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Japantown is also home to a number of non-Japanese businesses, including Mexican, Hawaiian and Korean restaurants.

A number of organizations, including the Japantown Neighborhood Association, have joined to form the Japantown Community Congress of San Jose, which is a community partner to the City of San Jose (represented by the San Jose Redevelopment Agency) that looks after cultural preservation of the area (begun with CA SB 307).

Major festivals include Obon (every July), Nikkei Matsuri (every spring) and Aki Matsuri (every fall) and a newer festival, The Spirit of Japantown Festival (also in the fall). In addition there are events that are open to the public at Art Object Gallery and various street venues, including a year-round Certified Farmers Market run by the Japantown Business Association.

On March 22, 2021, the Japantown community formally started citizen foot patrols to increase security and prevent attacks on Asian Americans.

==Geography==
Japantown is located in Central San Jose, just north of Downtown San Jose. It is surrounded by the Northside neighborhood to its south and east. To its north are the Hyde Park and Luna Park neighborhoods. To its west is the Santa Clara County Civic Center district.

==Transit==
The Japantown area is also served by the VTA light rail Blue and Green lines at nearby Japantown/Ayer station.

==Parks and plazas==
Parks within Japantown include:
*Bernal Park
*Cannery Park

Backesto Park is located nearby in Northside neighborhood.
