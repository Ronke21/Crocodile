<text>The Associação de Futebol do Algarve () is one of the 22 district football associations that are affiliated to the Portuguese Football Federation. The AF Algarve administers lower tier football in the district of Faro.

==Background==
Associação de Futebol do Algarve, commonly referred to as AF Algarve, is the governing body for football in the district of Faro. The Football Association is based in Penha in Faro, close to Piscinas Municipais de Faro (Faro Municipal Swimming Pool) and Complexo Desportivo da Penha (Sports Complex of Penha). The Association&#x27;s President is António Coelho Matosa.

The organisation was established on 22 January 1922 following an initial meeting on 15 October 1921 at the Ginásio Clube Farense by representatives from a number of Algarve clubs including Sporting Clube Farense, Sport Lisboa e Faro, Boxing Futebol Clube (Portimão), Sporting Clube Olhanense, Lusitano Futebol Clube, Glória Futebol Clube, Portimonense Sporting Clube, Sport Club União, Sport Club &quot;Os Leões Portimonenses&quot; and Esperança Futebol Clube. The two previous attempts to establish a Football Association ended in failure.

==Competitions==
Algarve clubs compete in the three national levels of the Portuguese football league system in competitions run by the Portuguese League for Professional Football (Primeira Liga and LigaPro) and Portuguese Football Federation (Campeonato de Portugal (league)).

Below the Campeonato de Portugal, the competitions are organised at a district level (known in Portuguese as Distritais) with each District Association organising its competitions according to geographical and other factors. The AF Algarve runs two league competitions with the Division One (1ª divisão) being at the fourth level of the league system and Division Two (2ª divisão) at the fifth level. At one time this second tier was divided into two groups on a geographical basis.

In more general terms the AF Algarve currently organises District Championships for Football and Futsal for men and women for all age groups including Senior, Junior, Youth, Beginners, Infants and Schools.

<text>Prentiss Lafayette Walker (August 23, 1917 – June 5, 1998) was an American farmer, businessman, and politician from Mississippi. A staunch segregationist, in 1964 he became the first Republican to be elected to the United States House of Representatives from Mississippi during the twentieth century.

==Early life==
Walker was born in Taylorsville, Mississippi. He attended public schools in Taylorsville, Mize, and Las Cruces, New Mexico. In 1936, he attended Mississippi College in Clinton.

During World War II, he served in the US Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations. Then, he returned to his previous work as a chicken farmer in Smith County and became president of Walker Egg Farms, Inc., based in Mize. From 1937 to 1963, he was the owner of Walker&#x27;s Supermarket. In 1960, Walker served on the executive committee of the Mississippi Game and Fish Commission under Governor Ross Barnett.

==Political career==
In 1964, Walker was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, which met in San Francisco, California, and he ran as a Republican in , in the central eastern part of the state. He unseated 11-term incumbent W. Arthur Winstead by some 7,000 votes, an 11% margin, the first Republican breakthrough in Mississippi since Elza Jeffords served a term in Congress from 1883 to 1885.

Walker&#x27;s victory was made possible by two factors. The first was white Mississippians&#x27; anger at the national Democratic Party&#x27;s support for civil rights, which pushed many registered Democrats to vote for Barry Goldwater, who carried Mississippi in the 1964 presidential election with 87 percent of the vote.

The second was widespread suppression of African Americans&#x27; right to vote. Only 6.7 percent of eligible Black Mississippians were registered to vote in 1964. In Walker&#x27;s Congressional district, Goldwater won many of the counties with greater than ninety percent of the vote; two, Holmes and Noxubee, gave him a staggering 96.6 percent, tied for his best showing in the nation, and one which has never since been equalled by any presidential candidate in any county nationwide.

After winning the election, Walker&#x27;s first public appearance was to speak at a meeting organized by the group Americans for the Preservation of the White Race.

At a Republican fundraiser at the Mississippi Coliseum in the capital city of Jackson on June 20, 1983, US President Ronald Reagan would tell the following anecdote:
Former Congressman Prentiss Walker, who I understand is here today, tells a story about his first campaign. He dropped in on a farm and introduced himself as a Republican candidate. And as he tells it, the farmer&#x27;s eyes lit up, and then he said, &quot;Wait till I get my wife. We&#x27;ve never seen a Republican before.&quot;

And a few minutes later he was back with his wife, and they asked Prentiss if he wouldn&#x27;t give them a speech. Well, he looked around for kind of a podium, something to stand on, and then the only thing available was a pile of that stuff that the late Mrs. Truman said it had taken her thirty-five years to get Harry to call &quot;fertilizer.&quot;

So, he stepped up on that and made his speech. And apparently he won them over. And they told him it was the first time they&#x27;d ever heard a Republican. And he says, &quot;That&#x27;s okay. That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever given a speech from a Democratic platform.&quot;

Walker relinquished his House seat after only one term. He instead challenged U.S. Senator James Eastland. He ran well to Eastland&#x27;s right and accused the veteran senator of being too friendly with US President Lyndon Johnson and of not doing enough to block integration-friendly judges in his position as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

With 105,652 votes, Walker polled 26.7 percent at the general election. His supporters included blacks in southwestern Mississippi, which came as a surprise because of Walker&#x27;s open support for segregation. Black voters had entered the political process under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and carried Claiborne and Jefferson Counties for Walker in protest of Eastland as a &quot;Democratic Regular.&quot;

Years later, Wirt Yerger, the chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party in the 1960s, noted that Walker&#x27;s decision to relinquish his House seat after one term for the vagaries of a Senate race against the powerful Eastland was &quot;very devastating&quot; to the growth of the Republican Party in Mississippi.

In 1966, state Representative Lewis McAllister of Meridian, the first Republican elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives since Reconstruction, sought to hold Walker&#x27;s House seat for the Republican, but victory went to fellow State Representative Gillespie V. &quot;Sonny&quot; Montgomery, also of Meridian, who held the seat for 30 years. Walker tried to unseat Montgomery in 1968 but got only thirty percent of the vote. When Walker again ran for the Senate against Eastland in 1972, as an Independent, rather than a Republican, he drew only 14,662 votes (2.3 percent). The Rockefeller-style Republican Gil Carmichael, a former critic of Walker, trailed with 249,779 votes (38.7 percent), as Eastland won handily with 375,102 votes or 58.1 percent.

==Private life==
Walker and his wife, the former Dimple Howell, had two daughters, Treta Walker Butler and husband James of Mize and Jan Walker Magee of Magee. Prentiss and Dimple Walker are interred in Mize at Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Prentiss Walker Lake (originally called Ross Barnett Lake) near Mize is named in his honor.

<text>Cilk, Cilk++, Cilk Plus and OpenCilk are general-purpose programming languages designed for multithreaded parallel computing. They are based on the C and C++ programming languages, which they extend with constructs to express parallel loops and the fork–join idiom.

Originally developed in the 1990s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the group of Charles E. Leiserson, Cilk was later commercialized as Cilk++ by a spinoff company, Cilk Arts. That company was subsequently acquired by Intel, which increased compatibility with existing C and C++ code, calling the result Cilk Plus. After Intel stopped supporting Cilk Plus in 2017, MIT is again developing Cilk in the form of OpenCilk.

==History==
===MIT Cilk===
The Cilk programming language grew out of three separate projects at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science:

* Theoretical work on scheduling multi-threaded applications.
* StarTech – a parallel chess program built to run on the Thinking Machines Corporation&#x27;s Connection Machine model CM-5.
* PCM/Threaded-C – a C-based package for scheduling continuation-passing-style threads on the CM-5

In April 1994 the three projects were combined and christened &quot;Cilk&quot;. The name Cilk is not an acronym, but an allusion to &quot;nice threads&quot; (silk) and the C programming language. The Cilk-1 compiler was released in September 1994.

The original Cilk language was based on ANSI C, with the addition of Cilk-specific keywords to signal parallelism. When the Cilk keywords are removed from Cilk source code, the result should always be a valid C program, called the &quot;serial elision&quot; (or &quot;C elision&quot;) of the full Cilk program, with the same semantics as the Cilk program running on a single processor. Despite several similarities, Cilk is not directly related to AT&amp;T Bell Labs&#x27; Concurrent C.

Cilk was implemented as a translator to C, targeting the GNU C Compiler (GCC). The last version, Cilk 5.4.6, is available from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), but is no longer supported.

A showcase for Cilk&#x27;s capabilities was the Cilkchess parallel chess-playing program, which won several computer chess prizes in the 1990s, including the 1996 Open Dutch Computer Chess Championship.

===Cilk Arts and Cilk++===
Prior to , the market for Cilk was restricted to high-performance computing. The emergence of multicore processors in mainstream computing meant that hundreds of millions of new parallel computers were being shipped every year. Cilk Arts was formed to capitalize on that opportunity: in 2006, Leiserson launched Cilk Arts to create and bring to market a modern version of Cilk that supports the commercial needs of an upcoming generation of programmers. The company closed a Series A venture financing round in October 2007, and its product, Cilk++ 1.0, shipped in December, 2008.

Cilk++ differs from Cilk in several ways: support for C++, support for loops, and hyperobjects a new construct designed to solve data race problems created by parallel accesses to global variables. Cilk++ was proprietary software. Like its predecessor, it was implemented as a Cilk-to-C++ compiler. It supported the Microsoft and GNU compilers.

===Intel Cilk Plus===
On July 31, 2009, Cilk Arts announced on its web site that its products and engineering team were now part of Intel Corp. In early 2010, the Cilk website at codice_1 began redirecting to the Intel website (as of early 2017, the original Cilk website no longer resolves to a host). Intel and Cilk Arts integrated and advanced the technology further resulting in a September 2010 release of Intel Cilk Plus. Cilk Plus adopts simplifications, proposed by Cilk Arts in Cilk++, to eliminate the need for several of the original Cilk keywords while adding the ability to spawn functions and to deal with variables involved in reduction operations. Cilk Plus differs from Cilk and Cilk++ by adding array extensions, being incorporated in a commercial compiler (from Intel), and compatibility with existing debuggers.

Cilk Plus was first implemented in the Intel C++ Compiler with the release of the Intel compiler in Intel Composer XE 2010. An open source (BSD-licensed) implementation was contributed by Intel to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which shipped Cilk Plus support in version 4.9, except for the keyword, which was added in GCC 5.0. In February 2013, Intel announced a Clang fork with Cilk Plus support. The Intel Compiler, but not the open source implementations, comes with a race detector and a performance analyzer.

Intel later discontinued it, recommending its users switch to instead using either OpenMP or Intel&#x27;s own TBB library for their parallel programming needs.

===Differences between versions===
In the original MIT Cilk implementation, the first Cilk keyword is in fact codice_2, which identifies a function which is written in Cilk. Since Cilk procedures can call C procedures directly, but C procedures cannot directly call or spawn Cilk procedures, this keyword is needed to distinguish Cilk code from C code. Cilk Plus removes this restriction, as well as the codice_2 keyword, so C and C++ functions can call into Cilk Plus code and vice versa.

===Deprecation of Cilk Plus===
In May, 2017, GCC 7.1 was released and marked Cilk Plus support as deprecated. Intel itself announced in September 2017 that they would deprecate Cilk Plus with the 2018 release of the Intel Software Development Tools. In May 2018, GCC 8.1 was released with Cilk Plus support removed.

===OpenCilk===

After Cilk Plus support was deprecated by Intel, MIT has taken on the development of Cilk in the OpenCilk implementation, focusing on the LLVM/Clang fork now termed &quot;Tapir&quot;. OpenCilk remains largely compatible with Intel Cilk Plus. Its first stable version was released in March 2021.

==Language features==
The principle behind the design of the Cilk language is that the programmer should be responsible for &quot;exposing&quot; the parallelism, identifying elements that can safely be executed in parallel; it should then be left to the run-time environment, particularly the scheduler, to decide during execution how to actually divide the work between processors. It is because these responsibilities are separated that a Cilk program can run without rewriting on any number of processors, including one.

===Task parallelism: spawn and sync===
Cilk&#x27;s main addition to C are two keywords that together allow writing task-parallel programs.

* The keyword, when preceding a function call (), indicates that the function call () can safely run in parallel with the statements following it in the calling function. Note that the scheduler is not &quot;obligated&quot; to run this procedure in parallel; the keyword merely alerts the scheduler that it can do so.
* A statement indicates that execution of the current function cannot proceed until all previously spawned function calls have completed. This is an example of a barrier method.

(In Cilk Plus, the keywords are spelled and , or and if the Cilk Plus headers are included.)

Below is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci function in Cilk, with parallel recursive calls, which demonstrates the , and keywords. The original Cilk required any function using these to be annotated with the keyword, which is gone as of Cilk Plus. (Cilk program code is not numbered; the numbers have been added only to make the discussion easier to follow.)
cilk int fib(int n) {
 if (n &lt; 2) {
 return n;
 else {
 int x, y;

 x = spawn fib(n - 1);
 y = spawn fib(n - 2);

 sync;

 return x + y;
}
If this code was executed by a &quot;single&quot; processor to determine the value of , that processor would create a frame for , and execute lines 1 through 5. On line 6, it would create spaces in the frame to hold the values of and . On line 8, the processor would have to suspend the current frame, create a new frame to execute the procedure , execute the code of that frame until reaching a return statement, and then resume the frame with the value of fib(1) placed into &#x27;s variable. On the next line, it would need to suspend again to execute and place the result in &#x27;s variable.

When the code is executed on a &quot;multiprocessor&quot; machine, however, execution proceeds differently. One processor starts the execution of ; when it reaches line 8, however, the keyword modifying the call to tells the processor that it can safely give the job to a second processor: this second processor can create a frame for , execute its code, and store its result in &#x27;s frame when it finishes; the first processor continues executing the code of at the same time. A processor is not obligated to assign a spawned procedure elsewhere; if the machine only has two processors and the second is still busy on when the processor executing gets to the procedure call, the first processor will suspend and execute itself, as it would if it were the only processor. Of course, if another processor is available, then it will be called into service, and all three processors would be executing separate frames simultaneously.

(The preceding description is not entirely accurate. Even though the common terminology for discussing Cilk refers to processors making the decision to spawn off work to other processors, it is actually the scheduler which assigns procedures to processors for execution, using a policy called &quot;work-stealing&quot;, described later.)

If the processor executing were to execute line 13 before both of the other processors had completed their frames, it would generate an incorrect result or an error; would be trying to add the values stored in and , but one or both of those values would be missing. This is the purpose of the keyword, which we see in line 11: it tells the processor executing a frame that it must suspend its own execution until all the procedure calls it has spawned off have returned. When is allowed to proceed past the statement in line 11, it can only be because and have completed and placed their results in and , making it safe to perform calculations on those results.

The code example above uses the syntax of Cilk-5. The original Cilk (Cilk-1) used a rather different syntax that required programming in an explicit continuation-passing style, and the Fibonacci examples looks as follows:
thread fib(cont int k, int n)
 if (n &lt; 2) {
 send_argument(k, n);
 else {
 cont int x, y;
 spawn_next sum(k, ?x, ?y);
 spawn fib(x, n - 1);
 spawn fib(y, n - 2);
}

thread sum(cont int k, int x, int y)
 send_argument(k, x + y);


Inside &#x27;s recursive case, the keyword indicates the creation of a &quot;successor&quot; thread (as opposed to the &quot;child&quot; threads created by ), which executes the subroutine after waiting for the &quot;continuation variables&quot; and to be filled in by the recursive calls. The base case and use a operation to set their continuation variable to the value of , effectively &quot;returning&quot; the value to the successor thread.

===Inlets===
The two remaining Cilk keywords are slightly more advanced, and concern the use of &quot;inlets&quot;. Ordinarily, when a Cilk procedure is spawned, it can return its results to the parent procedure only by putting those results in a variable in the parent&#x27;s frame, as we assigned the results of our spawned procedure calls in the example to codice_4 and codice_5.

The alternative is to use an inlet. An inlet is a function internal to a Cilk procedure which handles the results of a spawned procedure call as they return. One major reason to use inlets is that all the inlets of a procedure are guaranteed to operate atomically with regards to each other and to the parent procedure, thus avoiding the bugs that could occur if the multiple returning procedures tried to update the same variables in the parent frame at the same time.

* The codice_6 keyword identifies a function defined within the procedure as an inlet.
* The codice_7 keyword can only be used inside an inlet; it tells the scheduler that any other procedures that have been spawned off by the parent procedure can safely be aborted.

Inlets were removed when Cilk became Cilk++, and are not present in Cilk Plus.

===Parallel loops===
Cilk++ added an additional construct, the parallel loop, denoted in Cilk Plus. These loops look like
void loop(int *a, int n)
 #pragma cilk grainsize = 100 // optional
 cilk_for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
 a[i] = f(a[i]);
}
This implements the parallel map idiom: the body of the loop, here a call to followed by an assignment to the array , is executed for each value of from zero to in an indeterminate order. The optional &quot;grain size&quot; pragma determines the coarsening: any sub-array of one hundred or fewer elements is processed sequentially. Although the Cilk specification does not specify the exact behavior of the construct, the typical implementation is a divide-and-conquer recursion, as if the programmer had written
static void recursion(int *a, int start, int end)
 if (end - start &lt;= 100) { // The 100 here is the grainsize.
 for (int i = start; i &lt; end; i++) {
 a[i] = f(a[i]);
 }
 else {
 int midpoint = start + (end - start) / 2;
 cilk_spawn recursion(a, start, midpoint);
 recursion(a, midpoint, end);
 cilk_sync;
}

void loop(int *a, int n)
 recursion(a, 0, n);


The reasons for generating a divide-and-conquer program rather than the obvious alternative, a loop that spawn-calls the loop body as a function, lie in both the grainsize handling and in efficiency: doing all the spawning in a single task makes load balancing a bottleneck.

A review of various parallel loop constructs on HPCwire found the construct to be quite general, but noted that the Cilk Plus specification did not stipulate that its iterations need to be data-independent, so a compiler cannot automatically vectorize a loop. The review also noted the fact that reductions (e.g., sums over arrays) need additional code.

===Reducers and hyperobjects===
Cilk++ added a kind of objects called &quot;hyperobjects&quot;, that allow multiple strands to share state without race conditions and without using explicit locks. Each strand has a view on the hyperobject that it can use and update; when the strands synchronize, the views are combined in a way specified by the programmer.

The most common type of hyperobject is a reducer, which corresponds to the reduction clause in OpenMP or to the algebraic notion of a monoid. Each reducer has an identity element and an associative operation that combines two values. The archetypal reducer is summation of numbers: the identity element is zero, and the associative &quot;reduce&quot; operation computes a sum. This reducer is built into Cilk++ and Cilk Plus:
// Compute ∑ foo(i) for i from 0 to N, in parallel.
cilk::reducer_opadd&lt;float&gt; result(0);
cilk_for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
 result += foo(i);
Other reducers can be used to construct linked lists or strings, and programmers can define custom reducers.

A limitation of hyperobjects is that they provide only limited determinacy. Burckhardt &quot;et al.&quot; point out that even the sum reducer can result in non-deterministic behavior, showing a program that may produce either or depending on the scheduling order:
void add1(cilk::reducer_opadd&lt;int&gt; &amp;r) { r++; }
cilk::reducer_opadd&lt;int&gt; r(0);
cilk_spawn add1(r);
if (r == 0) { r++; }
cilk_sync;
output(r.get_value());
===Array notation===
Intel Cilk Plus adds notation to express high-level operations on entire arrays or sections of arrays; e.g., an axpy-style function that is ordinarily written

 // y ← α x + y
 void axpy(int n, float alpha, const float *x, float *y)
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
 y[i] += alpha * x[i];
 }

can in Cilk Plus be expressed as

 y[0:n] += alpha * x[0:n];

This notation helps the compiler to effectively vectorize the application. Intel Cilk Plus allows C/C++ operations to be applied to multiple array elements in parallel, and also provides a set of built-in functions that can be used to perform vectorized shifts, rotates, and reductions. Similar functionality exists in Fortran 90; Cilk Plus differs in that it never allocates temporary arrays, so memory usage is easier to predict.

===Elemental functions===
In Cilk Plus, an elemental function is a regular function which can be invoked either on scalar arguments or on array elements in parallel. They are similar to the kernel functions of OpenCL.

===#pragma simd===
This pragma gives the compiler permission to vectorize a loop even in cases where auto-vectorization might fail. It is the simplest way to manually apply vectorization.

==Work-stealing==

The Cilk scheduler uses a policy called &quot;work-stealing&quot; to divide procedure execution efficiently among multiple processors. Again, it is easiest to understand if we look first at how Cilk code is executed on a single-processor machine.

The processor maintains a stack on which it places each frame that it has to suspend in order to handle a procedure call. If it is executing &quot;fib(2)&quot;, and encounters a recursive call to &quot;fib(1)&quot;, it will save &quot;fib(2)&quot;&#x27;s state, including its variables and where the code suspended execution, and put that state on the stack. It will not take a suspended state off the stack and resume execution until the procedure call that caused the suspension, and any procedures called in turn by that procedure, have all been fully executed.

With multiple processors, things of course change. Each processor still has a stack for storing frames whose execution has been suspended; however, these stacks are more like deques, in that suspended states can be removed from either end. A processor can still only remove states from its &quot;own&quot; stack from the same end that it puts them on; however, any processor which is not currently working (having finished its own work, or not yet having been assigned any) will pick another processor at random, through the scheduler, and try to &quot;steal&quot; work from the opposite end of their stack suspended states, which the stealing processor can then begin to execute. The states which get stolen are the states that the processor stolen from would get around to executing last.

<text>Orchard Lake is a 795-acre lake located in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The lake is within the city of Orchard Lake Village. It has a maximum depth and a surface elevation of 928-feet (283 m). Orchard Lake is the second-largest lake and third-deepest lake in Oakland County.

The lake has a 35-acre island in the middle of it, Apple Island. The island was frequently inhabited by local Native Americans before the coming of Western settlers, who later planted an apple orchard on the island, giving rise to the current name of the lake. Apple Island is now abandoned and has been designated a protected wildlife sanctuary. Once a year the island is circumnavigated by runners of Team CG across the lake’s frozen surface. Another island, Cedar Island, is near the lake&#x27;s western shore.

The campus of the old Michigan Military Academy is on the northeast shore of the lake. The campus is now home to SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary and St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory.

<doc id="945818" wikidata="Q4254860" url="?curid=945818" title="List of epidemics and pandemics">
<text>This is a list of the largest known epidemics and pandemics caused by an infectious disease in humans. Widespread non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer are not included. An epidemic is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time; in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic. Due to the long time spans, the first plague pandemic (6th century – 8th century) and the second plague pandemic (14th century – early 19th century) are shown by individual outbreaks, such as the Plague of Justinian (first pandemic) and the Black Death (second pandemic).

Infectious diseases with high prevalence are listed separately (sometimes in addition to their epidemics), such as malaria, which may have killed 50–60 billion people throughout history, or about half of all humans that have ever lived.

==Major epidemics and pandemics==
===By death toll===
Ongoing epidemics and pandemics are in . For a given epidemic or pandemic, the average of its estimated death toll range is used for ranking. If the death toll averages of two or more epidemics or pandemics are equal, then the smaller the range, the higher the rank. For the historical records of major changes in the world population, see world population.

===Depopulation of the Americas===

Not included in the above table are many waves of deadly diseases brought by Europeans to the Americas and Caribbean. Western Hemisphere populations were ravaged mostly by smallpox, but also typhus, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, mumps, yellow fever, and pertussis. The lack of written records in many places and the destruction of many native societies by disease, war, and colonization make estimates uncertain. Deaths probably numbered in the tens or perhaps over a hundred million, with perhaps 90% of the population dead in the worst-hit areas. Lack of scientific knowledge about microorganisms and lack of surviving medical records for many areas makes attribution of specific numbers to specific diseases uncertain.

===Infectious diseases with high prevalence===
There have been various major infectious diseases with high prevalence worldwide, but they are currently not listed in the above table as epidemics/pandemics due to the lack of definite data, such as time span and death toll.
* Malaria has had multiple documented temporary epidemics in otherwise non-affected or low-prevalence areas, but the vast majority of its deaths are due to its constant prevalence in affected areas.
* Tuberculosis (TB) became epidemic in Europe in the 18th and 19th century, showing a seasonal pattern, and is still taking place globally. The morbidity and mortality of TB and HIV/AIDS have been closely linked, known as &quot;TB/HIV syndemic&quot;. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 10 million new TB infections occur every year, and 1.5 million people die from it each year – making it the world&#x27;s top infectious killer (before COVID-19 pandemic). However, there is a lack of sources which describe major TB epidemics with definite time spans and death tolls.
* Hepatitis B: According to the World Health Organization, there are about 296 million people living with chronic hepatitis B, with 1.5 million new infections each year. In 2019, hepatitis B caused about 820,000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). In many places of Asia and Africa, hepatitis B has become endemic. In addition, a person is sometimes infected with both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV, and this population (about 2.7 million) accounts for about 1% of the total HBV infections.
* Hepatitis C: According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 58 million people with chronic hepatitis C, with about 1.5 million new infections occurring per year. In 2019, approximately 290,000 people died from the disease, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). There have been many hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics in history.

<text>ProTell (formally: &quot;The Society for Liberal Weapons Rights&quot;) is a Swiss gun-rights advocacy group based in Bern, Switzerland.

The association was founded in 1978 with the purpose of defending the right of law-abiding citizens to carry arms, and is opposed to any restrictions in this regard. Its name refers to the famous legend of Wilhelm Tell, shooting the apple off his son&#x27;s head with a single arrow. ProTell reports some 8500 members as of 2016. This corresponds to some 6.4% of the number of registered shooters in the &quot;Schweizer Schiesssportverband&quot;.

ProTell was one of the principal opponents to the federal popular initiative &quot;For the protection against gun violence&quot;, brought to referendum on February 13, 2011. The initiative was broadly rejected by the voters.

<text>Sir John Kaputin, CMG is a Papua New Guinean athlete and politician.

Kaputin was born on 11 July 1941 on Matupit Island, East New Britain Province. After his primary schooling in the province, he proceeded onto Rockhampton Boys Grammar School in Queensland, Australia (1956-1959) where he completed his secondary school.

He represented Papua and New Guinea as a sprinter at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.

He then qualified for a scholarship to study at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu (1966 – 1968), after which returned home to complete his studies at the University of Papua New Guinea in 1969.

Kaputin became an influential member and leader of the Mataungan Association in Rabaul. The association was a local Tolai grouping that was angered by the alienation of land by Germans and Australian plantation owners.

Armed with the leadership skills he had honed, he contested and easily won the 1972 General Elections and became the member for Rabaul Open for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s National Parliament. Kaputin was appointed Minister of Finance under the Chan/Okuk Government in 1980. Whilst Minister for Finance, Kaputin was instrumental in crafting important legislation to establish Papua New Guinea&#x27;s private company employees retirement fund, the National Provident Fund, which later became the National Superannuation Fund of Papua New Guinea NASFUND. Kwila Insurance was also introduced under Kaputin.

Kaputin was the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea from 1992 until 1994 and from December 1999 until 2000. He is a co-founder of the Melanesian Alliance Party. He was named Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1983 and Knight Bachelor in 1997.

In March 2005, he took office as secretary-general of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, holding the position until 2010.

In December 2011, Kaputin, alongside Edward Laboran, became the inaugural inductees into the Papua New Guinea Olympic Committee Sporting Hall of Fame.

<text>The Associação de Futebol de Viseu (&quot;Viseu Football Association&quot;, abrv. &quot;AF Viseu&quot;) is the district governing body for the all football competitions in the Portuguese district of Viseu. It is also the regulator of the clubs registered in the district.

==Background==
Initially called the Federação Desportiva de Viseu, it was officially founded on October 15, 1926.

The founding clubs were:

*Grupo União Futebol 
*Sport Lisboa e Viseu
*Lusitano Futebol Clube 
*Sporting Clube de Viseu 
*Futebol Clube do Porto e Viseu 
*Sport Ribeira Viriato 
*Clube Académico de Futebol

Several Viseu clubs compete in the national levels of the Portuguese football league system in competitions run by the Portuguese League for Professional Football (Segunda Liga) and Portuguese Football Federation (Campeonato Nacional de Seniores).

Below the Campeonato Nacional de Seniores (Portuguese fourth level) the competitions are organised at a district level (known in Portuguese as Distritais) with each District Association organising its competitions according to geographical and other factors. AF Viseu runs a league competition with two divisions, at the fourth and fifth levels of the Portuguese football league system, two cup competition known as Taça AF Viseu and Taça da Primeira Divisão, and a Supercup between the Taça AF Viseu and the Liga de Honra winners.

==Main Competitions==
===Leagues===
The Divisão de Honra is the first tier of the Viseu Football Association. Between 1927 and 1947 it was a Regional Championship called 1ª Divisão. At the end of each season, the top-finishing team is promoted to the Campeonato de Portugal, and the lowest-ranked teams are relegated to the AF Viseu second tier.

Twenty different teams have won the division title; the most successful is Académico de Viseu, with seventeen wins. The inaugural champion was Lusitano.

The 1ª Divisão is the second tier in the Viseu district division and started in the 1951–52 season. In the past it was divided into two zones that divide the district: Zona Norte (North) and Zona Sul (South). The two winners from each zone played against each other in one play-off to crown the champion. Nowadays it is divided in three zones, the previous two and the new Zona Centro (Center). The final round is contested in a group stage format with the two best teams of each zone plus the two best third-placed teams. 

The Segunda Divisão was the third tier of the Viseu Football Association. The first season was 1978–79 but it was abolished after the restructure of the Portuguese football league system, with the 2010–11 season being the competition&#x27;s last. The first champion was Sernancelhe and final champion was Mangualde.

<doc id="945859" wikidata="Q937050" url="?curid=945859" title="Metal Box">
<text>Metal Box is the second studio album by Public Image Ltd, released by Virgin Records on 23 November 1979. The album takes its name from the round metal canister which contained the initial pressings of the record. It was later reissued in standard vinyl packaging as Second Edition in February 1980 by Virgin Records in the United Kingdom, and by Warner Bros. Records and Island Records in the United States.

The album was a departure from PiL&#x27;s 1978 debut &quot;First Issue&quot;, with the band moving into a more avant-garde sound characterised by John Lydon&#x27;s cryptic lyrics, propulsive dub-inspired rhythms led by bassist Jah Wobble, and an abrasive, &quot;metallic&quot; guitar sound developed by guitarist Keith Levene.

&quot;Metal Box&quot; is widely regarded as a landmark of post-punk. In 2012, the album was ranked number 461 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Background==
The first studio album recorded following the departure of founding member, drummer Jim Walker. &quot;Metal Box&quot; was recorded in several sessions with several drummers, none of whom were credited on the original release. &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;/&quot;Death Disco&quot; were recorded with new drummer David Humphrey at The Manor Studio in Shipton-on-Cherwell. &quot;Poptones&quot; was recorded with Levene on drums. During this time, additional tracks were recorded at The Town House Studios in London, namely &quot;Beat the Drum for Me&quot; (which later turned up on Wobble&#x27;s first solo album), and a new version of &quot;Fodderstompf&quot; (which became the B-side of PiL&#x27;s &quot;Death Disco&quot; 12&quot; single). Humphrey left the band around mid-May 1979. &quot;Memories&quot;, &quot;No Birds&quot;, &quot;Socialist&quot; and &quot;Chant&quot; were recorded with new drummer, Richard Dudanski, previously of Joe Strummer&#x27;s R&amp;B pub rock outfit, The 101ers, at Townhouse Studios in London. The instrumental &quot;Graveyard&quot; was recorded with Dudanski on drums. Dudanski left the band around mid-September 1979. &quot;The Suit&quot; was recorded as a solo track by Jah Wobble at Gooseberry Sound Studios in London. Vocals and some overdubs were added at The Manor. &quot;Careering&quot; was recorded at Town House Studios with Wobble on drums. &quot;Bad Baby&quot; was recorded with new drummer Martin Atkins at Town House Studios. Except for a brief period during 1980, Atkins remained with the band until 1985. &quot;Radio 4&quot; was recorded as a solo piece by Keith Levene at Advision Studios and an unknown second studio. According to Levene, this was the last recorded track. Levene utilised aluminium Veleno guitars throughout the recording sessions to achieve a distinctively sharp and metallic guitar sound.

==Recording and music==
According to John Lydon, opener &quot;Albatross&#x27;&quot; was recorded live at The Manor Studio in Oxfordshire, with the singer free-forming his lyrics. Guitarist Keith Levene, bassist Jah Wobble, and drummer David Humphrey made the song up as they went along, and recorded the song in one take. PiL also recorded at Townhouse Studios in West London with session drummer Richard Dudanski and produced the songs &quot;Memories&quot;, &quot;No Birds&quot;, &quot;Socialist&quot;, and &quot;Chant&quot;; Levene recalls that &quot;Memories&quot; features him playing &quot;this normal Spanish guitar thing that goes dun-da-da-dun da-da-dun... it&#x27;s one of the first things I learned to play on guitar, very simple. I was very fond of that [...] I just had the guitar going through an Electric Mistress.&quot;

&quot;Death Disco&quot; – released as a single in late June 1979 – was remixed and retitled &quot;Swan Lake&quot; for &quot;Metal Box&quot;. &quot;I realised,&quot; said Levene, &quot;that this tune that I was bastardising by mistake was &#x27;Swan Lake&#x27;, so I started playing it on purpose but I was doing it from memory. You can hear that I&#x27;m not playing it exactly right. It just worked. [...] There&#x27;s a few versions of that. The one on &quot;Metal Box&quot; is version two, which is very different from the simpler, original 12-inch version.&quot; The lyrics are based on Lydon&#x27;s mother dying of cancer: &quot;When I had to deal with my mother&#x27;s death, which upset the fuck out of me, I did it partly through music. I had to watch her die slowly of cancer for a whole year. I wrote &#x27;Death Disco&#x27; about that. I played it to her just before she died and she was very happy. That&#x27;s the Irish in her, nothing drearily sympathetic or weak.&quot; PiL recorded the song at an empty hall in Brixton to test a three-bass sound system and worked with drummer Jim Walker but didn&#x27;t record with him.

&quot;Poptones&quot; was one of the first songs recorded for the album, according to Levene, who stated that he inadvertently played &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; during the song. According to Lydon, &quot;Poptones&quot; was based on a story &quot;straight out of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&quot; about a girl who was kidnapped and &quot;bundled, blindfolded, into the back of a car by a couple of bad men and driven off into a forest, where they eventually dumped her. The men had a cassette machine with an unusual tune on the cassette, which they kept playing over and over. The girl remembered the song, and that, along with her recollection of the car and the men&#x27;s voices, is how the police identified them. The police eventually stopped the car and found the cassette was still in the machine, with the same distinctive song on the tape.&quot; In his 2009 autobiography &quot;Memoirs of a Geezer&quot;, Jah Wobble says that Poptones refers to &quot;a journey we took in Joe the roadie&#x27;s Japanese car [..] and Joe had one of his dodgy cassettes playing.&quot;. He highlighted the song as &quot;the jewel in the PiL crown. [...] That [bass] line is as symmetrical as a snowflake. [..] We had a drummer with us who was pretty good [...] but the bloke just couldn&#x27;t get the right feel for &#x27;Poptones&#x27;. [...] In the end Levene put the drums down on that track, his drums are a bit loose, but that is actually a good thing.&quot;

Wobble cited &quot;Careering&quot; as his &quot;second-favourite track from &quot;Metal Box&quot;, and probably my favourite John Lydon vocal performance.&quot; Lyrically, the song is &quot;basically about a gunman [in Northern Ireland] who is careering as a professional businessman in London.&quot; The song was recorded at the Townhouse during a quick nighttime session helmed by Wobble; he told journalist Simon Reynolds in an interview: &quot;If you listen to the drum rhythm it is very similar to the sort of rhythm a drum and fife band would create. [...] By now Keith had got hold of a Prophet synth, he used that on &#x27;Careering&#x27;.&quot; Wobble created the drum track and bassline, while Levene played synth. Levene explained his synth playing in the song was an attempt to replicate the sound of ambient machine noise heard from a downstairs toilet, achieved by dropping an item on one of the synth keys to keep it going.

&quot;No Birds Do Sing&quot; (also listed as just &quot;No Birds&quot;) features a line from &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot;, a poem by John Keats, which Lydon &quot;just borrowed a bit of because it suited this particular rant about suburbia.&quot; The song was recorded at the Townhouse with drummer Richard Dudanski, whom Keith Levene knew during his tenure with The 101ers. Wobble said that Dudanski made extensive and imaginative use of the tom-tom drums, and Levene told Simon Reynolds that &quot;No Birds&quot; is one of his favourite songs on the album. &quot;All that it is is me playing the guitar part and duplicating it, but feeding the second one through this effect I&#x27;d set up on the harmoniser. Meanwhile John is lying under the piano and singing that weird feedback voice, while twinkling the keys at the same time, just to be annoying. You can hear the piano on the record,&quot; said Levene.

&quot;Graveyard&quot; features a guitar part that was &quot;made up on the spot,&quot; according to Levene. &quot;I was in a very Clint Eastwood mood. I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to play. Wobble&#x27;s playing the bassline and drums are playing so I had to do something.&quot; The album version is an instrumental, a version with lyrics and vocals was retitled &quot;Another&quot; and released as the B-side to &quot;Memories&quot; in October 1979.

&quot;The Suit&quot;—described by Lydon as being about &quot;people of low origins trying to be posh&quot;—is one of Levene&#x27;s least favourite tracks. Levene said, &quot;It was never one of my favourite pieces because of what it was really about. [...] There was this guy that was an old mate of John&#x27;s who lived in this apartment. At some point John decided he hated his guts. He just wrote this really nasty, finger-pointing, over-exaggerated, ripping parody of what the guy was – &#x27;Society boy.&#x27; [...] This guy, [fashion designer] Kenny MacDonald, made his suit and all of ours and it made him look good to have the guys from PiL wearing his stuff. We&#x27;d wear it wrong and it looked even better, we didn&#x27;t want the black leather jacket look like these punk bands. So John just decided to hate this guy, that&#x27;s what happens and there&#x27;s nothing you can do. He wouldn&#x27;t be his lapdog and John thought he was a star and wanted that.&quot; Wobble played and recorded the backing track of drums and piano for &quot;The Suit&quot; at Gooseberry Studios with Mark Lusardi, which started out as a cover of &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;. He brought the backing track to the band at The Manor, to which Lydon &quot;freaked out when he heard that... He was galvanised into action and within a few hours &#x27;The Suit&#x27; existed.&quot;

&quot;Bad Baby&quot;—its title a nickname of Levene&#x27;s—was recorded at the Townhouse. Wobble (whose playing in the song was inspired by bassist Cecil McBee) and drummer Martin Atkins recorded the song together.

Levene recalled that &quot;Socialist&quot; featured cheap synthesizers he had purchased: &quot;Me and Wobble were really having fun fucking around with these things, whilst submerged in the mix was this huge soaring sound, rising upwards from the drum and the bass, like a whale&#x27;s cry. Later on I dubbed up the cymbals, so you have that spiralling metallic sound. Dubwise!&quot; Wobble told Simon Reynolds, &quot;At the time I was a bit of a socialist. [...] I hated Thatcher, I hated everything Reagan stood for to be quite honest, you know, and at that time I just wanted that old-style, left-wing socialism.&quot;

Lydon called &quot;Chant&quot; an &quot;old English ditty with a string synthesizer&quot;. Drummer Richard Dudanski cited it as one of his favourites.

Album closer &quot;Radio 4&quot; was named after the BBC radio station. &quot;I called it &#x27;Radio 4&#x27; because in England, you got Radio 1, 2, 3...,&quot; said Levene. &quot;Radio 1 played pop tunes. Before that, the BBC was so boring! It took until about 1985 before we had FM radio.&quot; &quot;Radio 4&quot; was recorded and performed by Levene, initially with Ken Lockie from Cowboys International on drums, at Advision Studios. Levene played the bassline &quot;as if it was Wobble playing,&quot; and played a Yamaha String Ensemble to create the layered synth sounds. &quot;I was using this thing and I start building it up, all I&#x27;m doing is taking different sounds from this thing and layering it. When I heard it, I pulled the drums out. I got on the idea of trying to make it sound orchestrated with the long chords played shorter. To get round the other stuff, I just used what was at hand. I played bass like I imagined Wobble would play bass to it, I wanted a Wobble feel to it. But basically, it&#x27;s all me – that&#x27;s when I realised I can completely do everything. You just hear the drums at the end. [...] With &#x27;Radio 4&#x27;, I was just alone in the studio one night, and I was overwhelmed with the sense of space. I just took everything out of the studio, moved the drum kit out and played everything myself, reproducing this sense of cold spaciousness I felt around me.&quot;

&quot;Many people don&#x27;t understand that [the album] was improvisation,&quot; Lydon recalled. &quot;It had to be, because we&#x27;d spent most of the money on the container &quot;[see below]&quot; – and so what we had to do was quite literally sneak into studios when bands had gone home for the night. And these were pretty rough monitor mixes – no actual production.&quot;

==Metal box packaging==
The title of the album refers to its original packaging, which consisted of a metal case in the style of a 16mm film canister embossed with the band&#x27;s logo and containing three 12&quot; 45rpm records. It was designed by Dennis Morris and was innovative and inexpensive, costing little more to the label than the cost of standard printed sleeves for equivalent 12&quot; releases (although Virgin did ask for a refund of a third of the band&#x27;s advance due to the cost). Before the metal tin was finalised, there was discussion of the album being released in a sandpaper package that would effectively ruin the sleeve art of any records shelved next to it. That idea would later be realised by the Durutti Column for their 1980 Factory Records debut, &quot;The Return of the Durutti Column&quot;.
The album&#x27;s lack of accessibility extended to the discs themselves. Packed tightly inside the canister and separated by paper sheets, they were difficult to remove, and were prone to being nicked and scratched in the process. Since each side only contained about ten minutes of music, the listener was required to frequently change sides to hear the complete album.

Deleted from the catalogue on 23 November 1979 after an initial release of 60,000 units, the album was re-issued on 22 February 1980 as &quot;Second Edition&quot;, a double LP packaged in a more conventional gatefold. The sleeve art of &quot;Second Edition&quot; consists of distorted photographs of the band members, achieving a funhouse mirror effect. (The front cover is a composite photo of Keith Levene and John Lydon.) The lyrics are printed on the rear cover. These were originally printed in a magazine advertisement and not included with &quot;Metal Box&quot;. The band initially wanted the album released with a lyric sheet but no track titles. The United Kingdom version of &quot;Second Edition&quot; appears as the band intended, with lyrics on the back cover, but no titles, and &quot;PiL&quot; logo labels on all four sides of the vinyl. The US edition of &quot;Second Edition&quot; has track titles both on the back cover and the labels.

The original metal canister idea was used a few years later during the compact disc era. By the late 1980s, a number of CDs were packaged in metal canisters. In 1990 the concept came full circle, with the compact disc release of &quot;Metal Box&quot; employing a smaller version of the original metal canister, containing a single disc and a small paper insert.

Tape with the PiL logo was created with the intent of sealing each metal box. However, labor costs were deemed too expensive and the tape went unused. Martin Atkins has some of this tape and has put some pieces of it up on auctions to benefit The Museum Of Post Punk and Industrial Music. 
==Critical reception==
&quot;Metal Box&quot; is now considered a post-punk classic, and is highly acclaimed. Andy Kellman of AllMusic said that &quot;PIL managed to avoid boundaries for the first four years of their existence, and &quot;Metal Box&quot; is undoubtedly the apex&quot;, noting that the album &quot;hardly [sounds] like anything of the past, present, or future&quot;. He also compared it to the works of Captain Beefheart and Can. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; reviewer Mark Ward wrote that the album &quot;tears away from Lydon&#x27;s sweaty punk roots and into the cold chambers of dub evoked by Can, the more outré electronics of Bowie&#x27;s Berlin years and the coruscating post-punk sound that guitarist Levene was in the process of pioneering&quot; and that &quot;if you don&#x27;t yet have a copy, you really should&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;a full-bodied superaware white dub with disorienting European echoes.&quot;

The album was ranked at No. 2 among the top &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; for 1979 by &quot;NME&quot;, with &quot;Death Disco&quot; ranked at No. 11 among the year&#x27;s top tracks. Robert Palmer placed the album at third place in his best of 1980 list for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, proclaiming the album to be the &quot;definitive album of postpunk rock and the year&#x27;s most compelling slice of metal machine music.&quot;

In 2003, the album was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list at No. 469, the magazine calling it &quot;eerie, futuristic art punk with dub bass and slashing guitar&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also included it in their 100 Best Albums of the Eighties, ranking it at No. 76. In 2002, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Metal Box&quot; at No. 19 on its &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&quot;. It was also, along with their debut album, included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, with the reviewer Stevie Chick saying &quot;the abrasive textures and powerful sounds they discovered...would influence all manner of experimental music for decades to come&quot;, while describing it as &quot;cold dank, unforgiving, subterranean.&quot; The songs &quot;Albatross&quot;, &quot;Poptones&quot;, &quot;Careering&quot;, &quot;Chant&quot; and &quot;Radio 4&quot; were selected as &quot;key tracks&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list, praising the band for pushing &quot;beyond post-punk into a fractured space between demented abstraction and cranky freedom&quot;.

Bassist Jah Wobble recorded and released a new version of the album in 2021, titled &quot;Metal Box - Rebuilt in Dub&quot;.

<text>The Associação de Futebol de Bragança &quot;(Bragança Football Association)&quot; is one of the 22 District Football Associations that are affiliated to the Portuguese Football Federation. The AF Bragança administers lower tier football in the district of Bragança.

== Background ==
Associação de Futebol de Bragança, commonly referred to as AF Bragança, is the governing body for football in the district of Bragança. The Football Association is based in Bragança. The Association&#x27;s President is Eduardo Humberto Pires Ane.

The organisation was founded on 30 September 1930 and was affiliated to the Portuguese Football Federation on 24 January 1931. Sport Clube de Mirandela represented the district of Bragança in the national championships in those early years. From 1945 until 1953 there is no evidence that AF Bragança was operating and leading clubs affiliated to AF Vila Real.

==Competitions==
In 2013-14 3 Bragança clubs compete in the national levels of the Portuguese football league system in Campeonato Nacional de Seniores (the third level of the Portuguese football league system), a competition run by the Portuguese Football Federation.

Below the Campeonato Nacional de Seniores (Portuguese third level) the competitions are organised at a district level (known in Portuguese as Distritais) with each District Association organising its competitions according to geographical and other factors. The AF Bragança runs one league competition known as the Division of Honour (Honra) at the fourth level of the league system and a cup competition known as Taça AF Bragança. At one time there were two divisions in the league, known as Honra and 1ª divisão but this format was dropped in 2005/06.

In more general terms the AF Bragança currently organises District Championships for football and Futsal for men and women for all age groups including Senior, Junior, Youth, Beginners, Infants and Schools.

==Notable clubs affiliated to AF Bragança==

<text>The Ponta Delgada Football Association () is the governing body for association football and futsal competitions in the Portuguese former-district of Ponta Delgada. This organization regulates football in the Azorean islands of São Miguel and Santa Maria.

== History ==
The foundation of the Football Association began with the growth of many social and cultural institutes and organizations, unrelated to organized sport. One was the &quot;Ateneu Comercial de Ponta Delgada&quot; (&quot;Commercial Athenaeum of Ponta Delgada&quot;) at the edge of celebrating its first century of existence, and that inherited a voluminous and well-elaborated place in the society and culture. The &quot;Associação de Socorros Mútuos União e Trabalho&quot; which began in the last century, and helped to motivate public training, that formed schools, including one in Lagoa. The &quot;Sociedade Promotora de Instrução e Recreio&quot; (&quot;Society for the Promotion of Training and Recreation&quot;), who had a century of existence, but which eventually ceased, providing an important role in the social context, during the many festivals and cultural activities.

Within the &quot;Ateneu Comercial&quot; functioned the &quot;Associação Auxiliadora do Ensino Industrial e Comercial&quot; (&quot;Auxiliary Association of Commercial and Industrial Training&quot;) taught by professors António Maria Lopes (Portuguese) and Urbano de Arruda Carreiro (Accounting). Further, there was the commercial course of the &quot;Associação dos Empregados do Comércio e Indústria do Distrito Oriental dos Açores&quot; (&quot;Association of Commercial and Industrial Employees of the Eastern District of the Azores&quot;), which ended in the middle of the 20th century, when the &quot;Escola Industrial e Comercial de Ponta Delgada&quot; (&quot;Industrial and Commercial School of Ponta Delgada&quot;) began to operate, under the direction of Governaor Rafael Sérgio Vieira, at the Solar Jácome Correia (later site of the Roberto Ivens Secondary School).

At the beginning of the 20th century, the &quot;Liga Micaelense de Instrução Pública&quot; (&quot;Micalense League of Public Instruction&quot;) founded by Aires Jácome Correia, then Marquess of Jácome Correia, operated unnoticed, if not for the acts of the Ponta Delgada Cultural Institute. One of the two initiatives, that were generously financed, was the &quot;Escola Industrial de Rendas de Bilro&quot; (&quot;Industrial School of Rendas de Bilro&quot;), which survived, with the activities of female youth in the 1930s (along a building of &quot;Rua do Brum&quot;). Also around this time, at the end of 1911 and beginning of 192, was the celebrated &quot;Sociedade Promotora da Agricultura Micaelense&quot; (&quot;Promotional Society of Micalense Agriculture&quot;), with many meetings at the building along &quot;Alameda Duque de Bragança&quot;, seat of the Meteorological Observatory Afonso de Chaves for more than 50 years. Dating from 1843, this organization had its agricultural garden, that later were sold off to João Augusto Carreiro de Mendonça, along &quot;Rua Diário dos Açores&quot;, later the &quot;Banco Comercial dos Açores&quot; offices.

It was in the &quot;Sociedade Promotora da Agricultura Micaelense&quot;, &quot;Sociedade Promotora da Instrução e Recreio&quot; and the &quot;Sociedade dos Amigos das Letras e das Artes&quot;, founded in 1884 by António Feliciano de Castilho, that fomented the associative movement of São Miguel, managing several initiatives and, ultimately, founding other organizations, sport clubs and the need to form a football association in Ponta Delgada.

=== Football ===
A few Micalense educated in the United Kingdom, travelling on holiday, brought a football, and in 1898, formed two groups: one in red, and the other blue, facing-off in the pitch of the agricultural market of São Gonçalo. Both groups consisted of the early pioneers of football to the island: Rolando de Viveiros, Marquês de Jácome Correia, Weber Tavares, Edgardo Garcia and Alfredo Pinto, along with other locals, José de Carvalho, António Botelho da Câmara, José Morais Pereira, Padre James Machin (do Colégio Fisher), Raul Pregadeiro, Alberto Morais de Carvalho, Martiniano da Silva, Ernesto Pinto, Guilherme Machado de Faria e Maia, Manuel da Silva, Joaquim Correia e Silva, among others. Dr. Aristides Moreira da Mota, João de Morais Pereira and João José de Viveiros occupied the positions of leaders, thus stimulating, with the prestige of his name and his age, the sporting initiative.

At end of the 19th and early 20th century, the newspapers, and specifically the paper &quot;A Persusão&quot;, directed by Francisco Maria Supico, celebrated the achievements of several organizations. But, it was just after the First World War, that football began to be practiced regularly, such as the &quot;Mata do Doca&quot;, where stationed North American forces during the war could be found, increasing local commerce.

<text>Maningrida (Ndjébanna: &quot;Manayingkarírra&quot;, Kuninjku: &quot;Manawukan&quot;) is an Aboriginal community in the heart of the Arnhem Land region of Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory. Maningrida is east of Darwin, and north east of Jabiru. It is on the North Central Arnhem Land coast of the Arafura Sea, on the estuary of the Liverpool River.

The Kunibídji (Ndjebbana) people are the traditional owners of this country. Major players in the town&#x27;s economic and political life include the West Arnhem Regional Council, the Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation, the Maningrida Progress Association, and Mala&#x27;la Health Service Aboriginal Corporation. Maningrida Arts &amp; Culture, with its Djómi Museum, is a major art centre, known both nationally and internationally.

At the 2021 census, Maningrida had a population of 2,518.
== History ==

The Kunibídji (Ndjebbana) people are the traditional owners of this country. The name Maningrida is an Anglicised version of the Kunibídji name Manayingkarírra, which comes from the phrase &quot;Mane djang karirra&quot;, meaning &quot;the place where the Dreaming changed shape&quot;. It is also known as Manawukan, the name assigned to it by the neighbouring Kuninjku people, which refers to a wetland area north-east of Maningrida.

The township of Maningrida dates back to just after World War 2. Syd Kyle-Little, working for the newly-formed Native Affairs Department, came up with the plan of a trading post to create a self-sufficient Aboriginal community, to stop the drift of Aboriginal people leaving their homelands and moving to Darwin. The intention was to make Maningrida self-sufficient and independent of welfare support. Jack Doolan became Kyle-Little&#x27;s cadet patrol officer, and together they made the first white contact with the Aboriginal peoples since a hostile encounter with Matthew Flinders on his circumnavigation of Australia. Kyle -Little had intended to open other trading posts to serve other peoples on their own lands, but with a change in administration of the NT in 1950, the trading post was closed, and Kyle-Little resigned in disgust.

David and Ingrid Drysdale, former missionaries, established a new settlement in 1957. Maningrida became the first government-sponsored settlement, as opposed to a mission settlement, in Arnhem Land. An airstrip, school and hospital were built, and people from far and wide drifted in to live at the settlement. The government&#x27;s motive was partly to quell the post-war migration of Aboriginal people from the Blyth and Liverpool Rivers regions into Darwin. Patrols went out to spread the word and encourage people to move into the settlement. Within a few years, the population had grown rapidly and the demographics of the area changed. This exacerbated traditionally strained relationships, and further tensions were created by the growing population of non-Indigenous people, known as Balanda, who were able to get jobs and decent housing. The number of Balanda grew from about 40 to 250 people between 1970 and 1974. The &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976&quot; gave Maningrida and other Aboriginal communities independence and self-government; however, Balanda still held most of the skilled and highly paid service positions.

From the 1960s onwards, the outstation movement led to many people returning to live on their traditional lands, which led to the establishment of the Bawinaga Aboriginal Corporation in 1970 (see below).

On the night of 24 April 2006 Cyclone Monica, the most severe cyclone ever to strike Australia at the time (later tied with Cyclone Marcus in 2018), passed just to the west of the community. The community was spared the full brute force of the category 5 cyclone and infrastructure damage was only light to moderate, despite a reported wind gust of 148 km/h at the town.

In 2015, the town became the subject of international news when it was incorrectly reported that &quot;more than 25,000 venomous spiders suddenly descended upon [the town]&quot;. The confusion stemmed from a new article documenting a floodplain near the town with an extremely high concentration of tarantulas.

==Location and demography==
Maningrida is east of Darwin, and north east of Jabiru. It is on the North Central Arnhem Land coast of the Arafura Sea, on the estuary of the Liverpool River.

At the 2016 census, Maningrida and its outstations had a population of 2,366, which included 309 people living on the 30 homelands (outstations) around Maningrida.
==Governance, community organisations and facilities ==
The West Arnhem Regional Council governs the local government area which includes Maningrida.

The Maningrida Progress Association was established in 1968 as a social welfare organisation, and registered as a Public Benevolent Institution in 2000. It provides financial assistance for things like housing, community services and projects, funerals, and other events.

The Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation was established as resource agency for outstations in 1970, and was incorporated in 1979. Maningrida Arts and Crafts, the Bábbarra Women&#x27;s Centre, Maningrida Wild Foods are all part of Bawinaga. In addition, the corporation manages a team of Indigenous rangers (Bawinanga Rangers – Land and Sea), various maintenance and retail enterprises, and community services.

The Mala&#x27;la Health Service Aboriginal Corporation runs a number of health care services for the community. In March 2021, the service completed its transition from governance by the NT Health Department to being a completely community-managed service run by the Corporation.

Maningrida College is the primary/secondary school.

== Country and culture ==
The north central Arnhem Land area serviced by Maningrida extends from Marrkolidjban in Eastern Kuninjku country to the west, to Berriba in Dangbon country in the south, and over as far as Yinangarnduwa, or Cape Stewart, in the east.

It might be the most multilingual community, on a per capita basis, in the world. People speak Ndjébbana, Kuninjku, Kune, Rembarrnga, Dangbon/Dalabon, Nakkara, Gurrgoni, Djinang, Wurlaki, Ganalbingu, Gupapuyngu, Kunbarlang, Gun-nartpa, Burarra, and Australian English. Most people have command of at least three of these languages.

There is great cultural diversity, including a variety of different ceremonial practices, styles of art and design, music and dance. 

===Maningrida Arts &amp; Culture===

Maningrida Arts and Culture, also known as Maningrida Art Centre, represents an art movement built by contemporary artists in Maningrida and the surrounding homelands, with its roots in body art, rock art and cultural practices. Its Djómi Museum contains a collection of nationally and internationally significant artworks, collected since the 1970s with works dating back to the 1940s, including photographs taken by Axel Poignant in the 1950s. Hundreds of artists work at the centre, including internationally acclaimed contemporary artists John Mawurndjul, Owen Yalandja, Crusoe Kurddal, Lena Yarinkura, and Bob Burruwal.

Maningrida Arts and Culture was initially managed by the Maningrida Progress Association, but became part of Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation in 1979.

==Environment==
===Important Bird Area===
Close to Maningrida is Haul Round Island, which has been identified as an Important Bird Area because of its seabird breeding colony - one of the largest in the Northern Territory. The seabird eggs, mainly those of roseate and bridled terns, are often harvested as a food resource.

<doc id="945885" wikidata="Q238688" url="?curid=945885" title="Floriano Peixoto">
<text>Floriano Vieira Peixoto (; 30 April 1839 – 29 June 1895) was a Brazilian military and politician, a veteran of the Paraguayan War and several other conflicts, and the second president of Brazil. Born in (today a district of the city of Maceió in the state of Alagoas) and nicknamed the Iron Marshal (), he was the first vice president of Brazil to have succeeded the president mid-term.

==Election==
Floriano Peixoto was an army marshal (he was promoted to this rank in 1874) when elected vice president in February 1891, he gained notoriety throughout his life for his strong abolitionist, anti-racist, and anti-corruption stance. In November 1891, he rose to the presidency after the resignation of generalissimo Deodoro da Fonseca, the first president of Brazil. Floriano Peixoto came to the presidency in a difficult period of the new Brazilian Republic, which was in the midst of a general political and economic crisis made worse by the effects of the bursting of the Encilhamento economic bubble, but his policies successfully put an end to the successive economic crises that had plagued the country since 1889 and in a short period of time the economy stabilized and grew again. As vice president, he had also served as the President of the Senate.

==Presidency==
His government was marked by several revolutions and immense popular support. Floriano Peixoto defeated a naval officers&#x27; rebellion against him in 1893–1894 and the Federalist Revolution in the States of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná, with the use of strength during the same year to maintain territorial integrity.

His government was marked by an increased centralization of power, personalismo, republicanism, patriotism, nationalism, and for the fervent criticism of monarchy, with the &quot;&quot;Florianista&quot; (&quot;Florianismo&quot;&quot;) cult of personality being the first phenomenon of a favorable political expression towards a republican politician in Brazil.

==Legacy==

He is often referred to as &quot;The Consolidator of the Republic&quot;, &quot;The Iron Marshal&quot;. He left the presidency on 15 November 1894.

Nossa Senhora do Desterro, the capital of the state of Santa Catarina, was renamed Florianópolis after the defeat of the federalist rebels in the city by the troops of Marshal Floriano Peixoto at the end of the Federalist Revolution.

<doc id="945892" wikidata="Q9634983" url="?curid=945892" title="Horta Football Association">
<text>The Horta Football Association () is one of the 22 District Football Associations that are affiliated with the Portuguese Football Federation. The AF Horta administers lower-tier football in the municipalities on the islands of Faial, Pico, Flores and Corvo, as well as those clubs registered in the islands.

==History==
The foundation of the Football Association of Horta was only possible after the founding of many of the football clubs that marked its history, and specifically the founding of the Fayal Sport Club, Angústias Atlético Clube and Sporting Club da Horta. Even in its early history, Horta was known as the &quot;Azorean city of Sporting Excellence&quot;, and on 2 February 1909, the Fayal Sport Club was established by an enthusiastic group of students from the &quot;Liceu of Horta&quot; (its first President was Manuel Tânger). Since there were no other club on the island at the time, the Fayal Sport played against visiting foreign workers of the submarine cable companies, and in particular, the British Football Club. Although the events were well contested, the games themselves were friendly, with no organizational structure. Interest in association football was so popular that, in 1913, Fayal S.C. completed its first inter-island game in Ponta Delgada, winning the matches and tournament in the regional capital.

It took another 14 years before another team, the &quot;Sporting Club da Horta&quot; was founded on 28 May 1922, under the direction of its first president Domingos Homem Garcia. In the same year, Fayal S.C. invited Casa Pia, and its celebrated kicker Cândido de Oliveira for a match. This was a precursor to the founding of the &#x27;Angústias Atlético Clube&#x27; (Angustias Athletic Club), was formed on 6 January 1923, under the direction of their first President Manuel Stattmiller de Saldanha e Albuquerque.

These changes and the growth of the popularity laid the seeds for the creation of the Football Association. In January 1924, the British Football Club proposed the &quot;constitution of an Association&quot; to begin operating almost immediately, while Fayal S.C. suggested that an association would be more practical in the proceeding season. Unfortunately, the three principal clubs did not intend in the formative period of the association&#x27;s creation.

In 1928, there were contacts between clubs to organize an Azorean Championship. The three teams on Faial met on 21 October 1930, at the &quot;Grémio Literário Artista Fayalense&quot; in the &quot;Largo do Bispo&quot; represented by António de Sousa Ramos Jr. (Fayal Sport Club), Jaime Maria Soares de Melo (Angústias Atletico Club), and Manuel d&#x27;Azevedo Castro Neves (Sporting Clube da Horta), whom achieved a consensus to form the &quot;Asociação de Futebol da Horta&quot;.

==Notable clubs==
Historically, the following teams were important in the development of association football on the islands, and responsible for the founding of the Horta Football Association:

* Angústias AC
* FC Madalena
* SC Horta

==Current Divisions - 2023–24 Season==

<text>Felice Anerio (26 or 27 September 1614) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, and a member of the Roman School of composers. He was the older brother of another important, and somewhat more progressive composer of the same period, Giovanni Francesco Anerio.

==Life==
Anerio was born in Rome and lived his entire life there. He sang as a boy soprano at the Julian Chapel (the Cappella Giulia) from 1568 until 1577 (by which time he was an alto) and then he sang at another church until 1580. Around this time, he began to compose, especially madrigals; this was one of the few periods in his life during which he wrote secular music. Likely he was influenced by Luca Marenzio, who was hugely popular at the time and who was in Rome at the same time Anerio began composing. By 1584, Anerio had been appointed &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Collegio degli Inglesi; he also seems to have been the choirmaster at another society of Rome&#x27;s leading musicians called the &quot;vertuosa Compagnia de i Musici di Roma&quot;. These positions must have given him considerable opportunity to exercise his compositional talents, for he had already written the music, songs, madrigals, and choruses for an Italian Passion Play by this time. In 1594, he replaced Palestrina as the official composer to the papal choir, which was the most prominent position in Rome for a composer.

In 1607 or shortly afterwards, he became a priest (a common career path for a composer in the Roman School). In conjunction with Francesco Soriano, another composer of the Roman School, he helped to reform the responsories of the Roman Gradual, another of the late activities of the Counter-Reformation in Italy.

==Works==
Anerio was a conservative composer, who largely used the style of Palestrina as a starting point, at least after his youthful period of writing secular works, such as madrigals and canzonettas, was done. Nevertheless, he achieved an expressive intensity which was his own. Some influence of the Northern Italian progressive movements is evident, though muted, in his work. For instance, the use of double choirs (polychoral works were the norm in Venice): quick homophonic declamatory textures, quick melodic passages in the bass line (which were an influence from monody). In addition, he sometimes used quickly changing textures, alternating between full chorus and small groups of two or three voices, another progressive trait of the northern Italian schools – a trait much in evidence, for example, in the music of Claudio Monteverdi. In his very last works, the influence of Viadana, the popularizer of the basso continuo, is evident, but he still remained true to the Palestrina style in his melodic and harmonic writing. Anerio wrote no known purely instrumental music.

Works by Felice Anerio include:

===Sacred vocal===
* Two books of &quot;Madrigali Spirituali&quot; (both Rome, 1585)
* Two books of sacred hymns (Venice, 1596 and Rome, 1596)
* Holy Week Responsories (for four voices, Rome, 1606)
* 13 Spiritual canzonettas; 12 motets, including many for 8 voices; psalms, litany, other works, many including a basso continuo
* Madrigals, choruses, solo songs for &quot;Passio de Nostro Signore in verso heroico&quot; (Viterbo, 1604)

===Secular vocal===
* One book of canzonettas (1586)
* Five books of madrigals (one of which is lost) (1587, 1590, 1598, 1602, unknown)
* Miscellaneous other madrigals not included in the main publications

Many magnificats, hymns, motets, and other works were printed by Karl Proske in his &quot;Musica Divina&quot; (1854).

<doc id="945899" wikidata="Q310230" url="?curid=945899" title="Prudente de Morais">
<text>Prudente José de Morais Barros (4 October 1841 – 3 December 1902), often referred to as Prudente de Morais, was a Brazilian lawyer and politician who served as the third president of Brazil from 1894 to 1898. Morais was elected in 1894, being the first civilian president of the country, the first to be elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of Brazil&#x27;s 1891 Constitution, and the first to serve his term in its entirety. Before his presidency he served as president (governor) of the state of São Paulo and president of the Senate from 1891 to 1894. He was also president of the Constituent Congress that drafted and enacted Brazil&#x27;s 1891 Constitution. 

His presidency was marked by the end of the Federalist Revolution in southern Brazil and the War of Canudos, a peasant revolt in the northeast of the country that was crushed by the Brazilian Army. He also had to face a break in diplomatic relations with Portugal that was successfully mediated by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

== Early life ==

=== Education ===
Born on 4 October 1841 in Itu, São Paulo Province, Prudente José de Morais Barros was the son of José Marcelino de Barros and Catarina Maria de Morais. At the age of three he lost his father, who was murdered by a slave. The murderer was later sentenced to death by jury, the last person to be sentenced to the death penalty in that district. His mother then married major Caetano José Gomes Carneiro and the family moved to Piracicaba. After receiving his first schooling from his own mother, Morais joined the Delgado School in 1855 at the age of 14, but the school was closed in the following year. Morais wanted to move to São Paulo, where he could take preparatory courses for the Faculty of Law, but his stepfather was against his decision, despite the expenses being covered by the inheritance left by his father. With the help of his mother, Morais was able to move to São Paulo in April 1857, where he enrolled at João Carlos da Fonseca&#x27;s school. In November 1858 he took his last preparatory exams and in 1859 he enrolled in the Faculty of Law.

During his studies at the Faculty of Law, Morais was a colleague of Campos Sales, Bernardino de Campos, Rangel Pestana, and Francisco Quirino dos Santos. Like many other leaders of the Brazilian Republic, in the faculty Morais joined the &quot;Bucha,&quot; a secret student society of a liberal, abolitionist, and republican nature founded by German professor Julius Frank and inspired by the Burschenschaft associations. Morais graduated with a Legal and Social Sciences degree in 1863 and moved to Piracicaba the following year, where he opened a law firm and began to work as an attorney.

=== Marriage and family ===
Prudente de Morais married Adelaide Benvinda da Silva Gordo on 18 May 1866 in Santos. Together they had seven children. Adelaide was the daughter of Antônio José da Silva Gordo. Morais&#x27; older brother was already married to Adelaide&#x27;s sister, Maria Inês.

== Political rise ==
Prudente de Morais joined the Liberal Party and was elected president of the Municipal Chamber of Piracicaba on 7 September 1864 for the 1865–1868 period. In this office he enacted the municipality&#x27;s first Manners Code. In October 1867 Morais was elected provincial deputy in the 3rd district to the 1868–1869 legislature in São Paulo, being appointed a member of the Provincial Assembly&#x27;s Justice and Legislation Commission.

In 1873, he joined the Republican Party of São Paulo (PRP) and declared himself a republican as a representative in the Provincial Assembly.

He was a provincial deputy in the city of São Paulo and deputy to the General Assembly of the Empire as a supporter of the republican form of government, abolition of slavery and federalism. As provincial deputy, he worked with the complex issue of the borders of São Paulo with Minas Gerais, a subject on which he was an expert.

After the proclamation of the Republic in 1889, his Party began to dominate national politics, and Morais was elected to the Constituent Congress as Senator for São Paulo. Due to his leading position in the Party, he was chosen by his peers as President of the Constituent Congress, that promulgated the Brazil&#x27;s first republican Constitution in 1891.

Morais ran in the first Brazilian presidential election (conducted by the Constituent Congress after the promulgation of the Constitution and in accordance with its transitional provisions), but lost to incumbent head of the Provisional Government Deodoro da Fonseca. After that election and the inauguration of the first president and vice-president, the Congress&#x27;s function as a Constituent Assembly ceased, and it became an ordinary bicameral National Congress, whereupon Morais&#x27; role as president of the Constituent Congress ended. Senator Prudente de Morais was then elected vice-president of the Federal Senate, the legislature&#x27;s upper house. The presidency of the Senate was vested by the Constitution in the vice-president of the Republic. In November 1891 however, President Deodoro da Fonseca attempted to dissolve Congress and rule as a dictator, but after a few weeks he was forced to resign the presidency due to the First Revolt of the Navy; Vice-President Floriano Peixoto then succeeded to the presidency of the Republic, and the vice-presidency became vacant and remained so until the next presidential election, in 1894. As a consequence, Morais, who until then was vice-president of the Senate, succeeded Peixoto as president of the Senate on 23 November 1891.

== Presidential election of 1894 ==

In the contest for the succession of Floriano Peixoto, Morais was nominated by the Federal Republican Party (PRF), founded by Francisco Glicério in 1893. He won the presidential election on 1 March 1894 and took office on 15 November that year, becoming the first president of Brazil to be elected by direct vote and the first civilian president of Brazil. Prudente gleaned 276,583 votes against 38,291 for his main competitor, Afonso Pena. The election had more than 29 politicians polled. His vice-president was Dr. Manuel Vitorino Pereira. His election marked the coming to power of the coffee oligarchy of São Paulo (the &quot;paulista oligarchy&quot;) in place of the military.

== Presidency (1894–1898) ==

=== Domestic policy ===
The four-year government of Prudente de Morais was shaken both by partisan political issues and continued fighting in Rio Grande do Sul, the center of the Federalist Revolt (1893–1895). Early in his government, he was able to resolve the latter difficulty by signing a peace treaty with the rebels, who received amnesty.

Later, Prudente de Morais devoted all of his efforts to pacify the policial factions within his country, which included extreme advocates of the centralist policies of Floriano Peixoto and supporters of the monarchy. During his rule, he abandoned the innovative measures of Floriano Peixoto one by one. A gradual approach was necessary since the Florianists still had some influence, particularly in the army, and the vice-president was connected to the ideas of the Florianists.

Shortly after the rebel movement in Rio Grande do Sul, Prudente faced an even greater challenge: the War of Canudos in the interior of Bahia.

Forced to undergo surgery, Prudente de Morais retired from power between 10 November 1896 and 4 March 1897, turning over his responsibilities to vice president Vitorino. During this interim, Vitorino transferred the seat of government from Itamaraty Palace to the Catete Palace.

With the early rebel victories of Antônio Conselheiro in the War of Canudos, the political situation further deteriorated. Morais interrupted his convalescence and then appointed Minister of War general to lead a new expedition to defeat the rebels.

Internal disputes within the PRF and the War of Canudos wore down the government. Even with the victory of the government troops in the war, tensions did not abate. On 5 November 1897, during a military ceremony, Morais withstood an assassination attempt. He escaped unharmed, but war minister Bittencourt died defending him. The president decreed a state of emergency in the Federal District in order to get rid of his most troublesome opponents.

The difficult economic and financial crisis inherited from the Encilhamento economic bubble took its toll on the administration, mainly because of military spending and increased debt to foreign creditors.

With the advice of his ministers of finance, Rodrigues Alves and Bernardino de Campos, Morais negotiated with British bankers to consolidate debt in a financial transaction known as the funding loan, based on the policy implemented by Joaquim Murtinho within four years.

=== Foreign policy ===
In foreign policy, in 1896 Morais faced a diplomatic issue involving the British, who took possession of the islands of Trindade and Martim Vaz in 1895, and the revolt of the Military School. He asserted his authority by closing the school and military club. The diplomatic issue was resolved favorably in favor of Brazil.

Prudente de Morais re-established relations with Portugal and signed a Treaty of Friendship with Japan in November 1895 with the aim of encouraging the arrival of Japanese immigrants.

A boundary dispute with Argentina arbitrated by U.S. President Grover Cleveland was resolved in favor of Brazil. Historians ascribe that diplomatic success to the efforts and diligence of the Brazilian Government&#x27;s representative, the Baron of Rio Branco, appointed by Morais to lead the Brazilian delegation in the arbitration process.

== Legacy ==
The city of Presidente Prudente, located in the western part of the state of São Paulo, is named after him.

<text>Adam Joseph van Koeverden (born January 29, 1982) is a Canadian sprint kayaker and politician. He is an Olympic gold medallist in the K-1 500m category (2004) and a two-time world champion in K-1 500 (2007) and K-1 1000 (2011), winning four Olympic and eight world championship medals. His home club is the Burloak Canoe Club in Oakville, Ontario.

In the 2019 Canadian federal election, Van Koeverden was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons, representing the electoral district of Milton as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada caucus.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Toronto to a Dutch father, Joe van Koeverden, and a Hungarian mother, Beata Bokrossy. Van Koeverden attended St. John Catholic Elementary School in Oakville, Ontario, graduating in 1996. He then proceeded to go to St. Ignatius of Loyola Catholic Secondary School also located in Oakville. He plays guitar.

Van Koeverden is a graduate of McMaster University&#x27;s Bachelor of Science Kinesiology program in Hamilton, Ontario. He graduated in June 2007 as valedictorian of his class.

== Career ==

=== Canoe sprinting ===
He won a bronze medal in the K-1 1000 m at the 1999 world junior championships in Zagreb, Croatia, and then became world junior marathon champion in 2000. His first success as a senior came with a silver medal at the 2003 world championships in Gainesville, Georgia, in the men&#x27;s K-1 1000 m event. At the 2004 Summer Olympics Van Koeverden won two medals, including a gold in the K-1 500 m and a bronze in the K-1 1000 m. He was Canada&#x27;s flag bearer at the closing ceremonies and was later awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s top athlete of 2004.

In 2005, Van Koeverden won two medals at the 2005 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in Zagreb: a silver in the K-1 1000 m and a bronze in the K-1 500 m. At the 2006 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in Szeged, Hungary, Van Koeverden finished fourth in both the K-1 500 m and 1000 m finals. At the 2006 Canadian Sprint Canoe Championships in Regina, Saskatchewan, he won five gold medals (K-1 1000 m, K-2 1000 m, K-4 1000 m, K-4 200 m, and War Canoe), and two silver medals (K-1 200 m and K-2 200 m).

Van Koeverden had great success on the World Cup circuit in 2007, going undefeated over both 500 m and 1000 m in three competitions. At the 2007 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in Duisburg, Van Koeverden won the gold medal in the K-1 500 m and the silver medal in the K-1 1000 m.

Van Koeverden beat his own world record in the K-1 500 m at the 2008 Beijing Olympics with a time of 1:35.554. He finished eighth place in the 1000m race, and finished with a silver medal in the K-1 500 m race. Originally, he had been listed as bronze medalist, until the scoreboard was corrected to indicate he had finished second. Van Koeverden had led most of the way from the start but was overtaken by the Australian winner Ken Wallace at the finish line, with British bronze medallist Tim Brabants ending in a photo finish with him.

In the leadup to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Van Koeverden was named flag bearer for the Canadian Olympic team at the opening ceremony, making him one of the few athletes to carry Canada&#x27;s flag twice at the Olympics. To celebrate the success of the hometown hero, on October 17, 2008, Oakville Mayor Rob Burton and local councillors hosted a meet and greet session. A ceremonial street name unveiling to honour Van Koeverden preceded the event. Adam van Koeverden Street, which is currently known as Water Street, is located near his Oakville harbour home club, the Burloak Canoe Club.

At the 2009 world championships in Dartmouth, he won a bronze medal in the K-1 1000 m event. The following year, he won another bronze, only this time it was in the K-1 500 m event. Continuing to build on these achievements at the world&#x27;s, Van Koeverden went to the 2011 world championships competing in the K-1 1000 m, where he finally won gold.

At the 2012 London Olympics he won the silver medal in the same event, while Norwegian Eirik Verås Larsen won gold. At the 2016 Rio Olympics he finished first in the B final, placing ninth overall.

In 2022, Van Koeverden was awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

=== Politics ===
On October 4, 2018, Van Koeverden announced he would be seeking the nomination of the Liberal Party of Canada in the riding of Milton to be a candidate in the 2019 Canadian federal election. Van Koeverden won the Liberal nomination on January 20, 2019, and won the Liberal seat in Milton on October 21, 2019, defeating the incumbent, Conservative Party deputy leader Lisa Raitt, taking over 51% of the vote to Raitt&#x27;s 36%.

In the 2021 federal election, Van Koeverden received over 51% of the vote defeating challenger Nadeem Akbar who carried just over 33% of the vote.

In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Van Koeverden was one of the 313 Canadians banned from entering Russia because of his support for Ukraine.

As of November 2023, Van Koeverden was listed on the House of Commons website as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and to the Minister of Sport and Physical Activity.

<doc id="945910" wikidata="Q5876333" url="?curid=945910" title="Fox games">
<text>Fox games are a category of asymmetric board games for two players, where one player (the fox) attempts to catch the opponent&#x27;s pieces (typically geese or sheep), while that player moves their pieces to either trap the fox or reach a destination on the board. In one variant, fox and hounds, a single fox tries to evade the other player&#x27;s hounds.

The game is known by many names around the world, including &quot;Fox and geese&quot; in Britain, &quot;Renard et les poules&quot; in France, &quot;Lupo e pecore&quot; in Italy, &quot;Fuchs und Gänse&quot; (or &quot;Fuchs und Henne&quot;) in Germany, &quot;Schaap en wolf&quot; in the Netherlands, &quot;riebantablu&quot; in Sápmi, &quot;Rävspel&quot; in Sweden, &quot;Refskák&quot; in Iceland, &quot;Ratón y gatos&quot; in Spain, &quot;Lis i gęsi&quot; in Poland, &quot;Vlci a ovce&quot; in Slovakia, &quot;Volk i ovtsy&quot; in Russia and &quot;Bagh-chal&quot; in Nepal.

==History==
The game &quot;Halatafl&quot; is known from at least as early as the 14th century, and it is mentioned in Grettis saga. It probably originated in Scandinavia, as a variant of Tafl. In fact, Halatafl is still played in Scandinavia with rules similar to Tafl; see below. Edward IV of England is known to have purchased two foxes and 26 hounds to form two sets of &quot;Marelles&quot;, believed to be Fox and Hounds. As Fox and Geese, the game was a favorite pastime of Queen Victoria.

==Halatafl==

&quot;Halatafl&quot; means &quot;tail board&quot;, in Old Norse, and &quot;tail&quot; presumably refers to a fox&#x27;s tail. As in Grettis saga, &quot;rävspelet&quot; (modern Swedish for &quot;the Fox game&quot;) is still played with holes and pegs.

There are two fox pegs (the red pegs on the picture) and 20 sheep pegs (the yellow pegs). Like the original game, &quot;tafl&quot;, the objective is for the defender (sheep) to reach a certain destination on the board, the square of nine holes marked with red, and it is the attacker&#x27;s (the foxes) objective to stop the defender from reaching it. The foxes are placed in the corners on the bottom of the red square (the paddock), whereas the sheep are placed on the opposite side of the board. When the players have decided who will move first, they move one step in turns. The sheep may only move forward or sideways, while the foxes may move in any direction, even backwards. If a sheep is in front of an empty hole, the fox has to jump over and capture the sheep, as in checkers. The capturing is mandatory, as are repeated jumps if possible. The sheep have won if they manage to fill the paddock, the red square.

==Fox and geese==

In the English-speaking world a simplified version is known as &quot;Fox and Geese&quot;. In this version the objective of reaching a certain location has been removed and instead it all comes down to capturing each other&#x27;s pieces. It is not mandatory for the fox to capture the opponent&#x27;s pieces, and there are no restraints on the defender&#x27;s (the geese&#x27;s) movements.

The fox is placed in the middle of the board, and 13 geese are placed on one side of the board. The fox and geese can move to any empty space around them (also diagonally). The fox can jump over geese like in checkers, capturing them. Repeated jumps are possible. Geese can not jump. Unlike in Halatafl, capturing is not mandatory. The geese win if they surround the fox so that it cannot move. The fox wins if it captures enough geese so that the remaining geese cannot surround it.

The traditional game with 13 geese is not well balanced and gives the advantage to the fox.
There are more balanced game variants with 15, 17 or 18 geese or two foxes.

Fox and geese is an example of a loopy game.

== Fox and hounds ==

This version (also called &quot;wolf and sheep&quot;, &quot;hounds and hare&quot;, or &quot;devil and tailors&quot;) is played on an 8×8 chessboard. As in draughts, only the dark squares are used. The four hounds are initially placed on the dark squares at one edge of the board; the fox is placed on any dark square on the opposite edge. The objective of the fox is to cross from one side of the board to the other, arriving at any one of the hounds&#x27; original squares; the hounds&#x27; objective is to prevent it from doing so.

The hounds move like a draughts man, diagonally forward one square. The fox moves like a draughts king, diagonally forward or backward one square. However, there is no jumping, promotion, or removal of pieces. The play alternates with the fox moving first. The player controlling the hounds may move only one of them each turn.

The fox is trapped when it can no longer move to a vacant square. It is possible for two hounds to trap the fox against an edge of the board (other than their original home-row) or even one corner (see diagram) where a single hound may do the trapping. Should a hound reach the fox&#x27;s original home row it will be unable to move further.

Perfect play will result in a &quot;hounds&quot; victory, even if the fox is allowed to choose any starting square and to pass his turn once during the game, as demonstrated in &quot;Winning Ways&quot;.

Koti keliya or the leopard game is a similar blockade game to fox and hounds, and was played in Sri Lanka. The game was documented by Henry Parker in &quot;Ancient Ceylon: An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation&quot; (1909). A 12 square x 12 square checkered board is used (144 squares in total), and Parker specifically mentions the checkered board to be red (or black) and white. One player plays the leopard which is represented by one piece, and six other pieces represents either cattle or dogs which is played by the other player. The cattle (or dogs) are initially placed on one side (its first rank) of the board, and on the white squares. The leopard may be placed on any vacant white square. Both leopard and cattle move in the diagonal direction only. The cattle are further restricted in their movements because they may only move one space in the forward diagonal direction in a turn onto a vacant square. The leopard may move in any diagonal direction one or two spaces in a turn provided the spaces are vacant. The objective of the cattle is to trap the leopard blocking its movements, whereas the leopard attempts to pass the cattle thus preventing the cattle from ever fulfilling their objective. There is no capturing in this game. Parker mentions that the game is not played in the interior villages of Sri Lanka.

<text>The secondary labor market is the labor market consisting of high-turnover, low-pay, and usually part-time or temporary work. Sometimes, secondary jobs are performed by high school or college students. The majority of service sector, light manufacturing, and retail jobs are considered secondary labor.

Secondary market jobs are sometimes referred to as “food and filth” jobs, a reference to workers in fast food, retail, or yard work, for example.

A secondary-market job is distinct from a &quot;secondary worker&quot;. The latter term refers to someone in a family (traditionally, the wife or a child) who earns a smaller income than the &quot;breadwinner&quot; in order to supplement family income.

<doc id="945923" wikidata="Q913651" url="?curid=945923" title="United States men's national ice hockey team">
<text>The United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with its U18 and U17 development program in Plymouth, Michigan. The team is controlled by USA Hockey, the governing body for organized ice hockey in the United States. The U.S. team is currently ranked 6th in the IIHF World Rankings.

The U.S. won gold medals at the 1960 and the 1980 Olympics and more recently, silver medals at the 2002 and 2010 Olympics. The U.S. also won the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, defeating Canada in the finals. The team&#x27;s most recent medal at the World Championships came with a bronze in 2021. They won the tournament in 1933 and 1960. Unlike other nations, the U.S. does not typically use its best NHL players in the World Championships. Instead, it provides the younger players with an opportunity to gain international experience. Overall, the team has collected eleven Olympic medals (two of them gold), nineteen World Championship medals (two of them gold), and it reached the semi-final round of the Canada Cup/World Cup five times, twice advancing to the finals and winning gold once. The U.S. has never reached a World Championship gold medal game, having lost in the semi-final round twelve times since the IIHF introduced a playoff system in 1992; this includes six semi-finals appearances in ten tournaments from 2013 through 2023, and three consecutive in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The U.S. is one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in the world and a member of the so-called &quot;Big Six&quot;, the unofficial group of the six strongest men&#x27;s ice hockey nations, along with Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, and Sweden.

==History==
The American ice hockey team&#x27;s greatest success was the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union on the way to a gold medal. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the &quot;Miracle&quot; is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the 1960 Games at Squaw Valley, California, defeating the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the &quot;Forgotten Miracle&quot;.

The United States hockey experienced a spike in talent in the 1980s and 1990s, with future NHL stars including Tony Amonte, Chris Chelios, Derian Hatcher, Brett Hull, Pat LaFontaine, John LeClair, Brian Leetch, Mike Modano, Mike Richter, Jeremy Roenick, Kevin Stevens, Keith Tkachuk, and Doug Weight. Although the U.S. finished no higher than fourth in any World or Olympic event from 1981 through 1994 (unlike other teams that used professionals, the U.S. team was limited to amateurs at these tournaments), the Americans reached the finals of the 1991 Canada Cup and won the 1996 World Cup. Six years later, after the International Olympic Committee and NHL arranged to accommodate an Olympic break in the NHL schedule, the U.S. earned a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics with a roster that included NHL stars Adam Deadmarsh, Chris Drury, Brian Rafalski, and Brian Rolston. However, by 2006, many of these NHL players had retired or had declined with age. Though the 2006 Olympic team finished a disappointing 8th, it was more of a transitional team, featuring young NHL players like Rick DiPietro, John-Michael Liles, and Jordan Leopold.

The 2010 U.S. Olympic team was composed of much younger and faster players than teams of previous years, including David Backes, Dustin Brown, Jack Johnson, Patrick Kane, Phil Kessel, Zach Parise, Joe Pavelski, Bobby Ryan, Paul Stastny, and Ryan Suter. The team also had a solid group of veterans that included such stars as goalie Ryan Miller, defenseman Brian Rafalski, and team captain Jamie Langenbrunner. The U.S. team upset team Canada 5–3 in the round-robin phase of the tournament and went into the single elimination phase of the tournament as the number-one seeded team. After beating Finland 6–1, the U.S. advanced to the gold medal game, where they lost in overtime 3–2 to Canada to claim the silver medal. The gold medal game between Canada and the U.S. was watched by an estimated 27.6 million U.S. households. This was the most watched hockey game in America since the 1980 &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; game, including any Stanley Cup Finals or NHL Winter Classic broadcast.

The NHL pulled out of the Olympics for the 2018 competition in a dispute over insurance and the IOC&#x27;s ambush marketing restrictions, prohibiting the national teams from inviting any player it held under contract. The American team was put at a particular disadvantage, as more than 31% of NHL players are Americans (in comparison, only 4.1% are Russians). As a result, the U.S. had to enter the tournament with a hastily assembled team of free agents, players from European leagues, AHLers on one-way contracts, and college players. The team proved unsuccessful, losing to Slovenia and the Olympic Athletes from Russia in the preliminary round, and being eliminated by the Czechs in the quarterfinals. The OAR team benefited most from NHL&#x27;s absence and ultimately won the tournament with a team that was composed primarily of SKA Saint Petersburg and HC CSKA Moscow players from the Russia-based KHL and featured ex-NHL all-stars Pavel Datsyuk, Ilya Kovalchuk and Vyacheslav Voynov (all SKA).

On March 31, 2021, Stan Bowman was appointed the general manager of the U.S. Olympic men&#x27;s hockey team for the 2022 Beijing Games. On October 26, 2021, Bowman resigned in response to the results of an independent investigation into allegations of sexual assault committed by a member of the Blackhawks&#x27; video coaching staff. The lead investigator stated that Bowman&#x27;s failure to report the alleged assault had eventually led to the perpetrator committing further acts of sexual abuse.

On February 2024, Bill Guerin was announced as general manager of the United States team for the 4 Nations Face-Off and 2026 Winter Olympics. In May, Mike Sullivan was named head coach of the team for both competitions.

<text>Stephen Giles (born July 4, 1972) is a Canadian sprint canoeist who competed from the early 1990s to the mid 2000s. Competing in four Summer Olympics, he won the bronze in the C-1 1000 m event at Sydney in 2000.

== Life ==
Giles was born in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. He began canoeing at age eight at the Orenda Racing Canoe Club in Lake Echo, Nova Scotia. He was a member of the Canadian national team for fifteen years, including eleven senior world championships. He was inducted into the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame in 2012.

He was adept at both the 500 m event and 1000 m early in his career. His best races came in the C-1 1000 m event later in his career, earning the world championship gold medal in 1998 at Szeged, Hungary. In the same event, he won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and a bronze medal at the 2002 World Championships in Seville, Spain. He also won a bronze medal at the 1993 world championships in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the men&#x27;s C-1 500 m event, and at the 1989 Junior World Championships in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Notable contemporaries in the C-1 included Andreas Dittmer, Martin Doktor, and Maxim Opalev.

Giles is part of a long line of successful Canadian paddlers in the C-1 discipline including Frank Amyot, John Wood, and Larry Cain. Since Giles&#x27; retirement in 2004, the tradition has been taken up by fellow Nova Scotian Richard Dalton, Thomas Hall, and Mark Oldershaw.

Giles holds Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Engineering degrees from Dalhousie University, as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws. He completed his Master of Business Administration degree at Saint Mary&#x27;s University in 2011. He currently works at EastLink in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was married in 1997. He and wife Angela (née Julien) have a daughter, Macy, and a son, Duncan.

In 2018 he was named one of the greatest 15 athletes in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history.

==2004 Olympics==
In the 2004 Summer Olympics, Giles competed in the C-1 1000 m event. He finished second in his initial heat, advancing to the semifinal with a time of 3:52.451. Giles won his semifinal with a time of 3:51.720, qualifying for the final. There, he placed fifth at 3:51.457.

<text>Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves, PC (; 7 July 1848 – 16 January 1919) was a Brazilian politician who first served as president of the Province of São Paulo in 1887, then as Treasury minister in the 1890s. Rodrigues Alves was elected the fifth president of Brazil in 1902 and served until 1906.

During this term he remodeled the then Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro, an effort punctuated by the 1904 &quot;Vaccine Revolt&quot;. He was elected president for a second term in 1918, but died in the influenza pandemic before assuming power, on 16 January 1919. He was succeeded by his vice-president, Delfim Moreira.

==Biography==
Rodrigues Alves was born in the city of Guaratinguetá, São Paulo. He graduated as a lawyer from the &quot;Faculdade de Direito do Largo de São Francisco&quot;, São Paulo, in 1870. His public career started as councilman in his native city, from 1866 to 1870. He became prosecutor in 1870. In 1872 he became a member of the state house of representatives until 1879. Also during the period of the Empire of Brazil, he took office as president of the province of São Paulo, from 1887 until 1888. After the proclamation of the Republic, he was a member of the Constitutional Assembly, and also a member of the house of representatives (1891/1893). He occupied the position of Treasury Secretary twice, from 1891 to 1892 and from 1894 to 1896.

He assumed his second mandate as state president in São Paulo from 1 May 1900 to 13 February 1902). On February 13 he resigned to run for Brazil&#x27;s presidency.

He was elected to rule as Brazil&#x27;s 5th president from 1902 to 1906. He distinguished himself as a great city planner and public financier. He applied his experience in the re-urbanization of the capital of the Republic, Rio de Janeiro.

He ran again for the presidency in 1918, won the election with over 99% of the vote, and was scheduled to take office on 15 November 1918. He was unable to do so because of illness, and he died on 16 January 1919, a victim of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918–1919.

40 years later in 1959, his grand-nephew, Carlos Alberto Alves de Carvalho Pinto, assumed his title of state president in São Paulo where he was the president of the state for 4 years.

<doc id="945930" wikidata="Q904802" url="?curid=945930" title="Cardinal virtues">
<text>The cardinal virtues are four virtues of mind and character in classical philosophy. They are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. They form a virtue theory of ethics. The term &quot;cardinal&quot; comes from the Latin (hinge); these four virtues are called &quot;cardinal&quot; because all other virtues fall under them and hinge upon them.

These virtues derive initially from Plato in &quot;Republic&quot; Book IV, 426-435. Aristotle expounded them systematically in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. They were also recognized by the Stoics and Cicero expanded on them. In the Christian tradition, they are also listed in the Deuterocanonical books in and , and the Doctors Ambrose, Augustine, and Aquinas expounded their supernatural counterparts, the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity.

== Four cardinal virtues ==
* Prudence (, ; ; also wisdom, , ), the ability to discern the appropriate course of action to be taken in a given situation at the appropriate time, with consideration of potential consequences; cautiousness.
* Justice (, ; ): also considered as fairness; the Greek word also having the meaning righteousness.
* Courage (, ; ): forbearance, strength, endurance, fortitude (patience and perseverance), dedication and the ability to confront fear, uncertainty, and intimidation (bravery, boldness, valor, daring). Notably, , being closely related to (&quot;adult male&quot;), could also be translated &quot;manliness&quot;. Some other definitions of courage are &quot;Andrea, virtus, spirit, heart, mettle, thumos, tenacity, gameness, resolution, bravery, boldness, valor, daring, hardihood, assertiveness, frame, gravitas, determination&quot;.
* Temperance (, ; ): also known as restraint, the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion, and moderation tempering the appetition. Plato considered , which may also be translated as sound-mindedness, to be the most important virtue. was often used in reference to drinking and &quot;knowing the right amount&quot; to avoid belligerence.

===Gallery, depiction of the cardinal virtues in 9th-century Europe===
An early European representation of the cardinal virtues from 845 AD is found in the Vivian Bible, Paris.
== Antiquity ==
The four cardinal virtues appeared as a group (sometimes included in larger lists) long before they were given this title.

=== Hellenistic philosophy ===
Plato associated the four cardinal virtues with the social classes of the ideal city described in &quot;The Republic&quot;, and with the faculties of humanity. Plato narrates a discussion of the character of a good city where the following is agreed upon:

&quot;Temperance&quot; was most closely associated with the producing classes, the farmers and craftsmen, to moderate their animal appetites. &quot;Fortitude&quot; was assigned to the warrior class, to strengthen their fighting spirit. &quot;Prudence&quot; was assigned to the rulers, to guide their reason. &quot;Justice&quot; stood above these three to properly regulate the relations among them.

Plato sometimes lists holiness (, , ) amongst the cardinal virtues. He especially associates holiness with justice, but leaves their precise relationship unexplained.

In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, we read:

These are expounded fully in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; III.6-V.2.

Philo of Alexandria, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, also recognized the four cardinal virtues as prudence, temperance, courage, and justice. In his writings, he states: 

These virtues, according to Philo, serve as guiding principles for a virtuous and fulfilling life.

=== Roman philosophy ===
The Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero (106-43 BC), like Plato, limits the list to four virtues:

Cicero discusses these further in &quot;De Officiis&quot; (I, V, and following).

Seneca writes in about justice ( from Ancient Greek ), self-control ( from Ancient Greek ), practical wisdom ( from Ancient Greek ) and devotion () instead of courage ( from Ancient Greek ).

The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius discusses these in Book V:12 of &quot;Meditations&quot; and views them as the &quot;goods&quot; that a person should identify in one&#x27;s own mind, as opposed to &quot;wealth or things which conduce to luxury or prestige&quot;.

Suggestions of the Stoic virtues can be found in fragments in the Diogenes Laertius and Stobaeus.

The Platonist view of the four cardinal virtues is described in &quot;Definitions&quot;. 

Practical wisdom or prudence () is the perspicacity necessary to conduct personal business and affairs of state. It encompasses the skill to distinguish the beneficial from the detrimental, to understand the attainment of happiness, and to discern the right course of action in every situation. Its antithesis or opposite is the vice of folly.

Justice () is the harmonious alignment of one&#x27;s inner self and the comprehensive integrity of the soul. It involves fostering sound discipline within each facet of our being, enabling us to live with others and extend the same regard to every individual. Additionally, justice pertains to a state&#x27;s aptitude to equitably allocate resources based on individuals&#x27; deservingness, as determined by their merits. It entails refraining from undue harshness, fostering a universal perception of fairness. Furthermore, it entails embodying the qualities of a law-abiding citizen or member of society, upholding principles of social equality. Justice encompasses the formulation of laws that can be substantiated by valid justifications, leading to a society where actions align with these laws.

Moderation or temperance () is the capacity to temper the indulgence of desires and sensory pleasures within the bounds of what is customary for the individual, aligning only with experiences already familiar to the soul. It encompasses achieving a harmonious equilibrium and exercising disciplined control when it comes to overall pleasure and pain, ensuring that they remain within normal ranges. Moreover, moderation involves cultivating a harmonious relationship and a balanced rule between the soul&#x27;s governing and being governed aspects. It signifies maintaining a state of natural self-reliance and exercising proper discipline as and when required by the soul. Rational consensus within the soul is essential concerning what merits admiration and what warrants disdain. This approach entails deliberate caution in one&#x27;s choices, as one&#x27;s selection navigates between the extremes.

Courage () can be defined as the ability to conquer fear within oneself when action is necessary. It encompasses military confidence, a deep understanding of warfare, and maintaining unwavering beliefs in the face of challenges. It involves self-discipline to overcome fear, obeying wisdom, and facing death boldly. Courage also entails maintaining sound judgment in tough situations, countering hostility, upholding virtues, remaining composed when faced with frightening (or encouraging) discussions and events, and not becoming discouraged. It reflects valuing the rule of law in our daily lives rather than diminishing its importance.

=== In the Bible ===
==== In the Old Testament ====
The cardinal virtues are listed in the deuterocanonical book , which reads:

They are also found in other non-canonical scriptures like , which relates:

==== In the New Testament ====

Wisdom, usually , rather than Prudence (), is discussed extensively in all parts of the New Testament. It is a major topic of 1 Corinthians 2, where the author discusses how divine teaching and power are greater than worldly wisdom.

Justice (, ) is taught in the gospels, where most translators give it as &quot;righteousness&quot;.

Plato&#x27;s word for Fortitude () is not present in the New Testament, but the virtues of steadfastness (, ) and patient endurance (, ) are praised. Paul exhorts believers to &quot;act like men&quot; (, , ).

Temperance (, ), usually translated &quot;sobriety,&quot; is present in the New Testament, along with self-control (, ).

== In Christian tradition ==
Catholic moral theology drew from both the Wisdom of Solomon and the Fourth Book of Maccabees in developing its thought on the virtues. Ambrose () used the expression &quot;cardinal virtues&quot;:

Augustine of Hippo, discussing the morals of the church, described them:

=== In relation to the theological virtues ===
The &quot;cardinal&quot; virtues are not the same as the three theological virtues: Faith, Hope, and Charity (Love), named in 1 Corinthians 13.

Because of this reference, a group of seven virtues is sometimes listed by adding the four cardinal virtues (prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice) and three theological virtues (faith, hope, charity).
While the first four date back to Greek philosophers and were applicable to all people seeking to live moral lives, the &quot;theological virtues&quot; appear to be specific to Christians as written by Paul in the New Testament.

Efforts to relate the cardinal and theological virtues differ. Augustine sees faith as coming under justice. Beginning with a wry comment about the moral mischief of pagan deities, he writes:

Dante Alighieri also attempts to relate the cardinal and theological virtues in his Divine Comedy, most notably in the complex allegorical scheme drawn in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXIX to XXXI. Depicting a procession in the Garden of Eden (which the author situates at the top of the mountain of purgatory), Dante describes a chariot drawn by a gryphon and accompanied by a vast number of figures, among which stand three women on the right side dressed in red, green, and white, and four women on the left, all dressed in purple. The chariot is generally understood to represent the holy church, with the women on right and left representing the theological and cardinal virtues respectively. The exact meaning of the allegorical women&#x27;s role, behaviour, interrelation, and color-coding remains a matter of literary interpretation.

=== In relation to the seven deadly sins ===
In the High Middle Ages, some authors opposed the seven virtues (cardinal plus theological) to the seven deadly sins. However, “treatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” And there are problems with this parallelism:

== Contemporary thought ==
Jesuit scholars Daniel J. Harrington and James F. Keenan, in their &quot;Paul and Virtue Ethics&quot; (2010), argue for seven &quot;new virtues&quot; to replace the classical cardinal virtues in complementing the three theological virtues, mirroring the seven earlier proposed in Bernard Lonergan&#x27;s &quot;Method in Theology&quot; (1972): &quot;be humble, be hospitable, be merciful, be faithful, reconcile, be vigilant, and be reliable&quot;.

== Allegory ==

The Cardinal Virtues are often depicted as female allegorical figures. These were a popular subject for funerary sculpture. The attributes and names of these figures may vary according to local tradition.

Yves Decadt, a Flemish artist, has created a series of artworks titled “Falling Angels: Allegories about the 7 Sins and 7 Virtues for Falling Angels and other Curious Minds”. The series explores the topic of morality, sins, and virtues, which have dominated Western cultures for more than 2000 years. In this work, Decadt follows in the footsteps of Pieter Breughel, who made a series of sketches on the 7 sins and 7 virtues about 500 years ago.   The work takes the viewer on an adventurous trip through time and across the barriers and edges of reality, mythology, religion, and culture. 

==The virtues in art==

In many churches and artwork the Cardinal Virtues are depicted with symbolic items:
; Justice
: sword, balance and scales, a crown

; Temperance
: wheel, bridle and reins, vegetables and fish, cup, water and wine in two jugs

; Fortitude
: armor, club, with a lion, palm, tower, a yoke, a broken column

; Prudence
: book, scroll, mirror, an attacking serpent

Notable depictions include sculptures on the tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and the tomb of John Hotham. They were also depicted in the garden at Edzell Castle.

<doc id="945950" wikidata="Q2124740" url="?curid=945950" title="Ruth Graham">
<text>Ruth McCue Bell Graham (June 10, 1920 – June 14, 2007) was a Chinese-born American Christian author. She was born in Qingjiang, Jiangsu, Republic of China, the second of five children. Her parents, Virginia Leftwich Bell and L. Nelson Bell, were medical missionaries at the Presbyterian Hospital north of Shanghai. At age 13 she was enrolled in Pyeng Yang Foreign School in Pyongyang, Korea, where she studied for three years. She completed her high school education at Montreat, North Carolina, while her parents were there on furlough. She graduated from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois.

The Grahams met at Wheaton College and were married in the summer of 1943, shortly after their graduation. Ruth Graham became a minister&#x27;s wife for a brief period in Western Springs, Illinois. She lived out the rest of her life in Montreat, North Carolina. The Grahams have five children: Virginia (Gigi), Anne, Ruth, Franklin, and Nelson Edman (Ned), 19 grandchildren, and numerous great-grandchildren.

Graham wrote a number of books, including some co-authored with her daughter Gigi Graham.

==Early life==
Ruth McCue Bell was born in Qingjiang, Jiangsu, China (now the main district of Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu, China). Her parents, Virginia Myers (née Leftwich) and Dr. L. Nelson Bell, were American medical missionaries at the Presbyterian Hospital 300 miles north of Shanghai. She grew up in China in a deeply religious household.

Graham studied for three years at a high school in Pyongyang, now in North Korea, before graduating from a school in Montreat, North Carolina, while her parents were on furlough.

==Married life==
Graham returned to the U.S. at the age of 17 in the fall of 1937, and enrolled at Wheaton College, outside Chicago, Illinois, where she met Billy Graham. They married on August 13, 1943. In 1945, after a brief stint as a suburban pastor, her husband became an evangelist for Youth for Christ. The Grahams moved to Montreat near her parents where the Grahams continued to live for the rest of their married life. Despite her husband being one of the world&#x27;s most famous Baptists, Graham remained a Presbyterian and often taught Sunday School.

Between 1945 and 1958, Graham gave birth to five children, whom she raised – sometimes single-handedly – while her husband was away on extended national and international evangelistic crusades. Their three daughters and two sons are all actively involved in ministry, including eldest son Franklin, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) founded by his father.

==Ministry==
In 1959, Graham published her first book, &quot;Our Christmas Story&quot;, an illustrated volume for children. She went on to write or co-write 13 other books, many of them works of poetry she wrote as an emotional release while her husband was so often on the road through the years.

Graham was a vital part of Billy Graham&#x27;s evangelistic career, and he turned to her for advice and input about many ministry decisions. One of the early uses of media by the BGEA was the &quot;Hour of Decision&quot; radio program begun in 1950, which she named. After her upbringing in China and high school experience in Korea, she continued to have compassion for the people of Asia. She encouraged her husband to visit and later accompanied him during his historic visits to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Graham&#x27;s significant role in her husband&#x27;s ministry was recognized in 1996, when they were jointly awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in a special ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C.

==Philanthropy==
In 1966, Graham founded the &quot;Ruth and Billy Graham Children&#x27;s Health Center&quot; in Asheville, North Carolina, with which she was actively involved until her death.

==Declining health and death==
Graham had been in frail health since suffering spinal meningitis in 1995. This was exacerbated by a degenerative osteoarthritis of the back and neck that began with a fall while testing a swing she made for her grandchildren in 1974 that resulted in chronic back pain for many years. During the final months of her life, she was bedridden and had contracted pneumonia.

The day before Ruth Graham&#x27;s death, Billy Graham released a statement through the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association stating, &quot;Ruth is my soul mate and best friend, and I cannot imagine living a single day without her by my side. I am more and more in love with her today than when we first met over 65 years ago as students at Wheaton College.&quot;

On Monday, June 11, at Graham&#x27;s request and subsequent to consultation with her family, she was removed from life support. On June 13, 2007, following her decline into a semi-coma, her husband announced that he and his wife had decided to be buried beside each other at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina. She died at 5:05 pm. EDT June 14, 2007, at the couple&#x27;s home, &quot;Little Piney Cove&quot;, in Montreat, North Carolina, with her husband and five children at her bedside, four days after her 87th birthday. A private ceremony followed by burial on the grounds of the Billy Graham Library was held on Sunday, June 17, 2007.

In a statement released from Wheaton College, Duane Litfin, president of the school, remarked, &quot;Strong, steady, and dauntless, Ruth Bell Graham was the glue that held many of the parts of their lives together.&quot;

<text>Nilo Procópio Peçanha (; 2 October 1867 – 31 March 1924) was a Brazilian politician who served as seventh president of Brazil. He was governor of Rio de Janeiro (1903–1906), then elected the fifth vice president of Brazil in 1906. He assumed the presidency in 1909 following the death of President Afonso Pena and served until 1910.

Despite controversies involving his racial identity, Peçanha is frequently considered as Brazil&#x27;s first Afro-Brazilian president.

==Biography==
Nilo Peçanha was born to Sebastião de Sousa Peçanha, a baker, and Joaquina Anália de Sá Freire, the descendant of a wealthy and noble family from northern Rio de Janeiro Province. He was one of seven siblings (five boys and two girls). His family lived in a state of poverty in the remote and poor neighborhood of Morro do Coco, Campos dos Goytacazes, and moved to the downtown area when Peçanha started elementary education.

He was frequently described as being a mulatto and often ridiculed in the press for his skin color. During his youth, the local Campos dos Goytacazes social elite alluded to him as the &quot;mestiço do Morro do Coco&quot; (the half-breed from Morro do Coco district). In 1921, when he ran for the Presidency of Republic, letters falsely attributed to the other candidate Artur Bernardes were published by the press and caused a political crisis because they insulted both the former president Marshal Hermes da Fonseca and also Peçanha, another former president, claiming he was a mulatto. Gilberto Freyre mentioned his &quot;mulatismo&quot; in Brazilian politics as the same that prevailed in Brazilian soccer. According to some scholars, his presidential photographs were touched up to whiten his dark skin.

Some scholars assert that, despite his &quot;tez escura&quot; (dark skin color), Nilo Peçanha always hid his black origins, and to this day his descendants and family have denied that he was a mulatto. The official biography written by a relative Celso Peçanha does not mention his racial origins, but another later biography does so, thus some scholars express doubts. In any case, his origins were very humble: he used to claim that he had been raised on day-old bread and paçoca (a candy made with peanuts, cassava flour and sugar).

After finishing his primary studies in his home city, Peçanha went on to study at the Law Schools of São Paulo and Recife, where he earned his degree. As a student, he supported both the campaign to abolish slavery and the establishment of the Republic.

Peçanha was married to Ana de Castro Belisário Soares de Sousa, also known as &quot;Anita&quot;, the descendant of an aristocratic and wealthy family from his birth city. She was a daughter of lawyer João Belisário Soares de Souza and of Ana Rachel Ribeiro de Castro, who was herself a daughter of the Viscount of Santa Rita, one of the richest men in northern Rio de Janeiro State. The marriage was a social scandal since the bride escaped her house to marry her poor and &quot;mulatto&quot; groom, despite his status as a promising young politician.

He worked as a lawyer and a university teacher in the &quot;Faculdade Livre de Direito do Rio de Janeiro&quot;.

Peçanha started his formal political career as an elected member of the first Republican Constituent Assembly in 1890. His political career advanced rapidly as a protégé of Campos Sales, who became President in 1898. In 1903 he was successively elected Senator and then President (Governor) of the state of Rio de Janeiro, remaining in the latter position until 1906, when he was elected vice-president under President Afonso Pena. As Vice President, he also served as the President of the Senate.

Pena died in 1909 while still in office and Peçanha assumed the presidency promising a government of &quot;Paz e Amor&quot; (Peace and Love). He was 41 years old, the youngest Brazilian president up until then.
His presidential government had many political troubles and Nilo Peçanha proved himself a man of wit and courage. The balance of power of the Brazilian República Velha (Old Republic) was a compromise of the governing elites of the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo. The deceased president, Afonso Pena, was elected with the support of this political alliance, but Peçanha assumed the presidency through being his vice-president and friction between the state oligarchies intensified. His government was also marked by friction with José Gomes Pinheiro Machado, the most powerful political leader of the Conservative Republican Party. Rui Barbosa started a run for the presidency promoting the &quot;Campanha Civilista&quot; (civilist campaign) against the Marshal Hermes da Fonseca, and attracted the opposition and discontent of the military. Federal intervention was required in the government of the Rio de Janeiro and Amazonas states.

Peçanha was a man of sharp political wit who carved a practical and non-doctrinaire course between the positivists and the idealistic adherents of a pure Republican system that fought each other during the first decades of Brazilian Republic. He was renowned for anticipating all the movements of his adversaries and achieving good political outcomes even when the odds were not favorable.

During his presidency, Peçanha created the Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, as well as the Indian Protection Service (SPI) and inaugurated the first system of technical schools in Brazil. He also began a basic sanitation program in the Baixada Fluminense region. He fought the excesses of workers in the public service and the high government expenditures that caused the elevation of taxes.
At the end of his mandate, he returned to the Senate and two years later was again elected President (Governor) for the state of Rio de Janeiro. He gave up this post in 1917 to take up the position of Minister of Foreign Relations and during his rule Brazil declared war against the Central Powers in World War I. In 1918, he was again elected to the Senate.

In 1921 he was a leader of the Republican Reaction Movement which had the goal of championing the politics of liberalism against those of the state oligarchies. His run for the presidency was supported by the state governments of Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco, and also by a large part of the military. The campaign was fierce with mutual attacks and the famous case of letters falsely attributed to candidate Artur Bernardes which insulted the military and the former president Marshal Hermes da Fonseca. Brazil was divided and despite the strong support, Peçanha was defeated by Artur Bernardes, the pro-government candidate in the presidential election of 1922.

Peçanha died in 1924 in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, retired from political life. His nephew, Celso Peçanha, later served as the acting Governor of Rio de Janeiro from 1961 to 1962.

<doc id="945957" wikidata="Q649337" url="?curid=945957" title="New Foundations">
<text>In mathematical logic, New Foundations (NF) is a non-well-founded, finitely axiomatizable set theory conceived by Willard Van Orman Quine as a simplification of the theory of types of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

== Definition ==

The well-formed formulas of NF are the standard formulas of propositional calculus with two primitive predicates equality (formula_1) and membership (formula_2). NF can be presented with only two axiom schemata:
* Extensionality: Two objects with the same elements are the same object; formally, given any set &quot;A&quot; and any set &quot;B&quot;, if for every set &quot;X&quot;, &quot;X&quot; is a member of &quot;A&quot; if and only if &quot;X&quot; is a member of &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is equal to &quot;B&quot;.
* A restricted axiom schema of comprehension: formula_3 exists for each stratified formula formula_4.

A formula formula_4 is said to be &quot;stratified&quot; if there exists a function &quot;f&quot; from pieces of formula_4&#x27;s syntax to the natural numbers, such that for any atomic subformula formula_7 of formula_4 we have &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + 1, while for any atomic subformula formula_9 of formula_4, we have &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). 

===Finite axiomatization===

NF can be finitely axiomatized. One advantage of such a finite axiomatization is that it eliminates the notion of stratification. The axioms in a finite axiomatization correspond to natural basic constructions, whereas stratified comprehension is powerful but not necessarily intuitive. In his introductory book, Holmes opted to take the finite axiomatization as basic, and prove stratified comprehension as a theorem. The precise set of axioms can vary, but includes most of the following, with the others provable as theorems:

* Extensionality: If formula_11 and formula_12 are sets, and for each object formula_13, formula_13 is an element of formula_11 if and only if formula_13 is an element of formula_12, then formula_18. This can also be viewed as defining the equality symbol.
* Singleton: For every object formula_13, the set formula_20 exists, and is called the singleton of formula_13.
* Cartesian Product: For any sets formula_11, formula_12, the set formula_24, called the Cartesian product of formula_11 and formula_12, exists. This can be restricted to the existence of one of the cross products formula_27 or formula_28.
* Converse: For each relation formula_29, the set formula_30 exists; observe that formula_31 exactly if formula_32.
* Singleton Image: For any relation formula_29, the set formula_34, called the singleton image of formula_29, exists.
* Domain: If formula_29 is a relation, the set formula_37, called the domain of formula_29, exists. This can be defined using the operation of type lowering.
* Inclusion: The set formula_39 exists. Equivalently, we may consider the set formula_40.

* Complement: For each set formula_11, the set formula_42, called the complement of formula_11, exists.
* (Boolean) Union: If formula_11 and formula_12 are sets, the set formula_46, called the (Boolean) union of formula_11 and formula_12, exists.
* Universal Set: formula_49 exists. It is straightforward that for any set formula_13, formula_51.
* Ordered Pair: For each formula_52, formula_53, the ordered pair of formula_52 and formula_53, formula_56, exists; formula_57 exactly if formula_58 and formula_59. This and larger tuples can be a definition rather than an axiom if an ordered pair construction is used.
* Projections: The sets formula_60 and formula_61 exist (these are the relations which an ordered pair has to its first and second terms, which are technically referred to as its projections).
* Diagonal: The set formula_62 exists, called the equality relation.
* Set Union: If formula_11 is a set all of whose elements are sets, the set formula_64, called the (set) union of formula_11, exists.
* Relative Product: If formula_29, formula_67 are relations, the set formula_68, called the relative product of formula_29 and formula_67, exists.

* Anti-intersection: formula_71 exists. This is equivalent to complement and union together, with formula_72 and formula_73.
* Cardinal one: The set formula_74 of all singletons, formula_75, exists.
* Tuple Insertions: For a relation formula_29, the sets formula_77 and formula_78 exist.
* Type lowering: For any set formula_67, the set formula_80 exists.

=== Typed Set Theory ===
New Foundations is closely related to Russellian unramified typed set theory (TST), a streamlined version of the theory of types of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; with a linear hierarchy of types. In this many-sorted theory, each variable and set is assigned a type. It is customary to write the &quot;type indices&quot; as superscripts: formula_81 denotes a variable of type &quot;n&quot;. Type 0 consists of individuals otherwise undescribed. For each (meta-) natural number &quot;n&quot;, type &quot;n&quot;+1 objects are sets of type &quot;n&quot; objects; objects connected by identity have equal types and sets of type &quot;n&quot; have members of type &quot;n&quot;-1. The axioms of TST are extensionality, on sets of the same (positive) type, and comprehension, namely that if formula_82is a formula, then the set formula_83 exists. In other words, given any formula formula_84, the formula formula_85 is an axiom where formula_86 represents the set formula_83 and is not free in formula_82. This type theory is much less complicated than the one first set out in the &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, which included types for relations whose arguments were not necessarily all of the same types.

There is a correspondence between New Foundations and TST in terms of adding or erasing type annotations. In NF&#x27;s comprehension schema, a formula is stratified exactly when the formula can be assigned types according to the rules of TST. This can be extended to map every NF formula to a set of corresponding TST formulas with various type index annotations. The mapping is one-to-many because TST has many similar formulas. For example, raising every type index in a TST formula by 1 results in a new, valid TST formula.

=== Tangled Type Theory ===

Tangled Type Theory (TTT) is an extension of TST where each variable is typed by an ordinal rather than a natural number. The well-formed atomic formulas are formula_89 and formula_90 where formula_91. The axioms of TTT are those of TST where each variable of type formula_92 is mapped to a variable formula_93 where formula_94 is an increasing function.

TTT is considered a &quot;weird&quot; theory because each type is related to &quot;each&quot; lower type in the same way. For example, type 2 sets have both type 1 members and type 0 members, and extensionality axioms assert that a type 2 set is determined uniquely by &quot;either&quot; its type 1 members or its type 0 members. Whereas TST has natural models where each type formula_95 is the power set of type formula_92, in TTT each type is being interpreted as the power set of each lower type simultaneously. Regardless, a model of NF can be easily converted to a model of TTT, because in NF all the types are already one and the same. Conversely, with a more complicated argument, it can also be shown that the consistency of TTT implies the consistency of NF.

=== NFU and other variants ===
NF with urelements (NFU) is an important variant of NF due to Jensen and clarified by Holmes. Urelements are objects that are not sets and do not contain any elements, but can be contained in sets. One of the simplest forms of axiomatization of NFU regards urelements as multiple, unequal empty sets, thus weakening the extensionality axiom of NF to:
* Weak extensionality: Two &quot;non-empty&quot; objects with the same elements are the same object; formally,
:formula_97
In this axiomatization, the comprehension schema is unchanged, although the set formula_98 will not be unique if it is empty (i.e. if formula_99 is unsatisfiable).

However, for ease of use, it is more convenient to have a unique, &quot;canonical&quot; empty set. This can be done by introducing a sethood predicate formula_100 to distinguish sets from atoms. The axioms are then:
* Sets: Only sets have members, i.e. formula_101
* Extensionality: Two &quot;sets&quot; with the same elements are the same set, i.e. formula_102
* Comprehension: The &quot;set&quot; formula_103 exists for each stratified formula formula_99, i.e. formula_105

NF3 is the fragment of NF with full extensionality (no urelements) and those instances of comprehension which can be stratified using at most three types. NF4 is the same theory as NF.

Mathematical Logic (ML) is an extension of NF that includes proper classes as well as sets. ML was proposed by Quine and revised by Hao Wang, who proved that NF and the revised ML are equiconsistent.

== Constructions ==

This section discusses some problematic constructions in NF. For a further development of mathematics in NFU, with a comparison to the development of the same in ZFC, see implementation of mathematics in set theory.

=== Ordered pairs ===
Relations and functions are defined in TST (and in NF and NFU) as sets of ordered pairs in the usual way. For purposes of stratification, it is desirable that a relation or function is merely one type higher than the type of the members of its field. This requires defining the ordered pair so that its type is the same as that of its arguments (resulting in a type-level ordered pair). The usual definition of the ordered pair, namely formula_106, results in a type two higher than the type of its arguments &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Hence for purposes of determining stratification, a function is three types higher than the members of its field. NF and related theories usually employ Quine&#x27;s set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair, which yields a type-level ordered pair. However, Quine&#x27;s definition relies on set operations on each of the elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, and therefore does not directly work in NFU. 

As an alternative approach, Holmes takes the ordered pair &quot;(a, b)&quot; as a primitive notion, as well as its left and right projections formula_107 and formula_108, i.e., functions such that formula_109 and formula_110 (in Holmes&#x27; axiomatization of NFU, the comprehension schema that asserts the existence of formula_3 for any stratified formula formula_4 is considered a theorem and only proved later, so expressions like formula_113 are not considered proper definitions). Fortunately, whether the ordered pair is type-level by definition or by assumption (i.e., taken as primitive) usually does not matter.

=== Natural numbers and the axiom of infinity ===
The usual form of the axiom of infinity is based on the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers, which is not suitable for NF, since the description of the successor operation (and many other aspects of von Neumann numerals) is necessarily unstratified. The usual form of natural numbers used in NF follows Frege&#x27;s definition, i.e., the natural number &quot;n&quot; is represented by the set of all sets with &quot;n&quot; elements. Under this definition, 0 is easily defined as formula_114, and the successor operation can be defined in a stratified way: formula_115 Under this definition, one can write down a statement analogous to the usual form of the axiom of infinity. However, that statement would be trivially true, since the universal set formula_116 would be an inductive set.

Since inductive sets always exist, the set of natural numbers formula_117 can be defined as the intersection of all inductive sets. This definition enables mathematical induction for stratified statements formula_118, because the set formula_119 can be constructed, and when formula_118 satisfies the conditions for mathematical induction, this set is an inductive set.

Finite sets can then be defined as sets that belong to a natural number. However, it is not trivial to prove that formula_116 is not a &quot;finite set&quot;, i.e., that the size of the universe formula_122 is not a natural number. Suppose that formula_123. Then formula_124 (it can be shown inductively that a finite set is not equinumerous with any of its proper subsets), formula_125, and each subsequent natural number would be formula_126 too, causing arithmetic to break down. To prevent this, one can introduce the axiom of infinity for NF: formula_127

It may intuitively seem that one should be able to prove &quot;Infinity&quot; in NF(U) by constructing any &quot;externally&quot; infinite sequence of sets, such as formula_128. However, such a sequence could only be constructed through unstratified constructions (evidenced by the fact that TST itself has finite models), so such a proof could not be carried out in NF(U). In fact, &quot;Infinity&quot; is logically independent of NFU: There exists models of NFU where formula_122 is a non-standard natural number. In such models, mathematical induction can prove statements about formula_122, making it impossible to &quot;distinguish&quot; formula_122 from standard natural numbers.

However, there are some cases where &quot;Infinity&quot; can be proven (in which cases it may be referred to as the theorem of infinity):

* In NF (without urelements), Specker{{sfn|Specker|1953}} has shown that the axiom of choice is false. Since it can be proved through induction that every finite set has a choice function (a stratified condition), it follows that formula_116 is infinite.
* In NFU with axioms asserting the existence of a type-level ordered pair, formula_116 is equinumerous with its proper subset formula_134, which implies &quot;Infinity&quot;.{{sfn|Holmes|1998|loc=sec. 12.1}} Conversely, NFU + &quot;Infinity&quot; + &quot;Choice&quot; proves the existence of a type-level ordered pair.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=I searched for quite a while and was unable to find a source for this statement. It is repeated in several online sources, but without proof or reference.}} NFU + &quot;Infinity&quot; interprets NFU + &quot;there is a type-level ordered pair&quot; (they are not quite the same theory, but the differences are inessential).{{Citation needed|date=March 2023|reason=What does the word &quot;interpret&quot; mean here?}}

Stronger axioms of infinity exist, such as that the set of natural numbers is a strongly Cantorian set, or NFUM = NFU + &quot;Infinity&quot; + &quot;Large Ordinals&quot; + &quot;Small Ordinals&quot; which is equivalent to Morse–Kelley set theory plus a predicate on proper classes which is a &quot;κ&quot;-complete nonprincipal ultrafilter on the proper class ordinal &quot;κ&quot;.

=== Large sets ===
NF (and NFU + &quot;Infinity&quot; + &quot;Choice&quot;, described below and known consistent) allow the construction of two kinds of sets that ZFC and its proper extensions disallow because they are &quot;too large&quot; (some set theories admit these entities under the heading of proper classes):
* &quot;The universal set V&quot;. Because formula_135 is a stratified formula, the universal set &quot;V&quot; = {&quot;x&quot; | &quot;x=x&quot;} exists by &quot;Comprehension&quot;. An immediate consequence is that all sets have complements, and the entire set-theoretic universe under NF has a Boolean structure.
* &quot;Cardinal and ordinal numbers&quot;. In NF (and TST), the set of all sets having &quot;n&quot; elements (the circularity here is only apparent) exists. Hence Frege&#x27;s definition of the cardinal numbers works in NF and NFU: a cardinal number is an equivalence class of sets under the relation of equinumerosity: the sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equinumerous if there exists a bijection between them, in which case we write formula_136. Likewise, an ordinal number is an equivalence class of well-ordered sets.

=== Cartesian closure ===
The category whose objects are the sets of NF and whose arrows are the functions between those sets is not Cartesian closed;{{sfn|Forster|2007}} Since NF lacks Cartesian closure, not every function curries as one might intuitively expect, and NF is not a topos.

== Resolution of set-theoretic paradoxes ==

NF may seem to run afoul of problems similar to those in naive set theory, but this is not the case. For example, the existence of the impossible Russell class formula_137 is not an axiom of NF, because formula_138 cannot be stratified. NF steers clear of the three well-known paradoxes of set theory in drastically different ways than how those paradoxes are resolved in well-founded set theories such as ZFC. Many useful concepts that are unique to NF and its variants can be developed from the resolution of those paradoxes.

=== Russell&#x27;s paradox ===
The resolution of Russell&#x27;s paradox is trivial: formula_139 is not a stratified formula, so the existence of formula_137 is not asserted by any instance of &quot;Comprehension&quot;. Quine said that he constructed NF with this paradox uppermost in mind.{{sfn|Quine|1987}}

=== Cantor&#x27;s paradox and Cantorian sets ===
Cantor&#x27;s paradox boils down to the question of whether there exists a largest cardinal number, or equivalently, whether there exists a set with the largest cardinality. In NF, the universal set formula_116 is obviously a set with the largest cardinality. However, Cantor&#x27;s theorem says (given ZFC) that the power set formula_142 of any set formula_11 is larger than formula_11 (there can be no injection (one-to-one map) from formula_142 into formula_11), which seems to imply a contradiction when formula_147.

Of course there is an injection from formula_148 into formula_116 since formula_116 is the universal set, so it must be that Cantor&#x27;s theorem (in its original form) does not hold in NF. Indeed, the proof of Cantor&#x27;s theorem uses the diagonalization argument by considering the set formula_151. In NF, formula_13 and formula_153 should be assigned the same type, so the definition of formula_12 is not stratified. Indeed, if formula_155 is the trivial injection formula_156, then formula_12 is the same (ill-defined) set in Russell&#x27;s paradox.

This failure is not surprising since formula_158 makes no sense in TST: the type of formula_142 is one higher than the type of formula_11. In NF, formula_158 is a syntactical sentence due to the conflation of all the types, but any general proof involving &quot;Comprehension&quot; is unlikely to work.

The usual way to correct such a type problem is to replace formula_11 with formula_163, the set of one-element subsets of formula_11. Indeed, the correctly typed version of Cantor&#x27;s theorem formula_165 is a theorem in TST (thanks to the diagonalization argument), and thus also a theorem in NF. In particular, formula_166: there are fewer one-element sets than sets (and so fewer one-element sets than general objects, if we are in NFU). The &quot;obvious&quot; bijection formula_167 from the universe to the one-element sets is not a set; it is not a set because its definition is unstratified. Note that in all models of NFU + &quot;Choice&quot; it is the case that formula_168; &quot;Choice&quot; allows one not only to prove that there are urelements but that there are many cardinals between formula_169 and formula_122.

However, unlike in TST, formula_171 is a syntactical sentence in NF(U), and as shown above one can talk about its truth value for specific values of formula_11 (e.g. when formula_147 it is false). A set formula_11 which satisfies the intuitively appealing formula_171 is said to be Cantorian: a Cantorian set satisfies the usual form of Cantor&#x27;s theorem. A set formula_11 which satisfies the further condition that formula_177, the restriction of the singleton map to &quot;A&quot;, is a set is not only Cantorian set but strongly Cantorian.{{sfn|Holmes|1998|loc=sec. 17.5}}

=== {{Anchor|Burali-Forti paradox}}Burali-Forti paradox and the T operation ===
The &quot;Burali-Forti paradox&quot; of the largest ordinal number is resolved in the opposite way: In NF, having access to the set of ordinals does not allow one to construct a &quot;largest ordinal number&quot;. One can construct the ordinal formula_178 that corresponds to the natural well-ordering of all ordinals, but that does not mean that formula_178 is larger than all those ordinals.

To formalize the Burali-Forti paradox in NF, it is necessary to first formalize the concept of ordinal numbers. In NF, ordinals are defined (in the same way as in naive set theory) as equivalence classes of well-orderings under isomorphism. This is a stratified definition, so the set of ordinals formula_180 can be defined with no problem. Transfinite induction works on stratified statements, which allows one to prove that the natural ordering of ordinals (formula_181 iff there exists well-orderings formula_182 such that formula_67 is a continuation of formula_29) is a well-ordering of formula_180. By definition of ordinals, this well-ordering also belongs to an ordinal formula_186. In naive set theory, one would go on to prove by transfinite induction that each ordinal formula_187 is the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than formula_187, which would imply an contradiction since formula_178 by definition is the order type of &quot;all&quot; ordinals, not any proper initial segment of them.

However, the statement &quot;formula_187 is the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than formula_187&quot; is not stratified, so the transfinite induction argument does not work in NF. In fact, &quot;the order type formula_192 of the natural order formula_193 on the ordinals less than formula_187&quot; is at least &quot;two&quot; types higher than formula_187: The order relation formula_196 is one type higher than formula_187 assuming that formula_198 is a type-level ordered pair, and the order type (equivalence class) formula_199 is one type higher than formula_193. If formula_198 is the usual Kuratowski ordered pair (two types higher than formula_13 and formula_203), then formula_192 would be &quot;four&quot; types higher than formula_187.

To correct such a type problem, one needs the T operation, formula_206, that &quot;raises the type&quot; of an ordinal formula_187, just like how formula_163 &quot;raises the type&quot; of the set formula_11. The T operation is defined as follows: If formula_210, then formula_206 is the order type of the order formula_212. Now the lemma on order types may be restated in a stratified manner:
:The order type of the natural order on the ordinals formula_213 is formula_214 or formula_215, depending on which ordered pair is used.
Both versions of this statement can be proven by transfinite induction; we assume the type level pair hereinafter. This means that formula_214 is always less than formula_178, the order type of &quot;all&quot; ordinals. In particular, formula_218.

Another (stratified) statement that can be proven by transfinite induction is that T is a strictly monotone (order-preserving) operation on the ordinals, i.e., formula_219 iff formula_220. Hence the T operation is not a function: The collection of ordinals formula_221 cannot have a least member, and thus cannot be a set. More concretely, the monotonicity of T implies formula_222, a &quot;descending sequence&quot; in the ordinals which also cannot be a set.

One might assert that this result shows that no model of NF(U) is &quot;standard&quot;, since the ordinals in any model of NFU are externally not well-ordered. This is a philosophical question, not a question of what can be proved within the formal theory. Note that even within NFU it can be proven that any set model of NFU has non-well-ordered &quot;ordinals&quot;; NFU does not conclude that the universe formula_116 is a model of NFU, despite formula_116 being a set, because the membership relation is not a set relation.

== Consistency ==

Some mathematicians have questioned the consistency of NF, partly because it is not clear why it avoids the known paradoxes. A key issue was that Specker proved NF combined with the Axiom of Choice is inconsistent. The proof is complex and involves T-operations. However, since 2010, Holmes has claimed to have shown that NF is consistent relative to the consistency of standard set theory (ZFC). In 2024, Sky Wilshaw confirmed Holmes&#x27; proof using the Lean proof assistant.

Although NFU resolves the paradoxes similarly to NF, it has a much simpler consistency proof. The proof can be formalized within Peano Arithmetic (PA), a theory weaker than ZF that most mathematicians accept without question. This does not conflict with Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem because NFU does not include the Axiom of Infinity and therefore PA cannot be modeled in NFU, avoiding a contradiction. PA also proves that NFU with Infinity and NFU with both Infinity and Choice are equiconsistent with TST with Infinity and TST with both Infinity and Choice, respectively. Therefore, a stronger theory like ZFC, which proves the consistency of TST, will also prove the consistency of NFU with these additions.{{sfn|Jensen|1969}} In simpler terms, NFU is generally seen as weaker than NF because, in NFU, the collection of all sets (the power set of the universe) can be smaller than the universe itself, especially when urelements are included, as required by NFU with Choice.

=== Models of NFU ===
Jensen&#x27;s proof gives a fairly simple method for producing models of NFU in bulk. Using well-known techniques of model theory, one can construct a nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory (nothing nearly as strong as full ZFC is needed for the basic technique) on which there is an external automorphism &quot;j&quot; (not a set of the model) which moves a rank formula_225 of the cumulative hierarchy of sets. We may suppose without loss of generality that formula_226.

The domain of the model of NFU will be the nonstandard rank formula_225. The basic idea is that the automorphism &quot;j&quot; codes the &quot;power set&quot; formula_228 of our &quot;universe&quot; formula_225 into its externally isomorphic copy formula_230 inside our &quot;universe.&quot; The remaining objects not coding subsets of the universe are treated as urelements. Formally, the membership relation of the model of NFU will be formula_231

It may now be proved that this actually is a model of NFU. Let formula_4 be a stratified formula in the language of NFU. Choose an assignment of types to all variables in the formula which witnesses the fact that it is stratified. Choose a natural number &quot;N&quot; greater than all types assigned to variables by this stratification. Expand the formula formula_4 into a formula formula_234 in the language of the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory with automorphism &quot;j&quot; using the definition of membership in the model of NFU. Application of any power of &quot;j&quot; to both sides of an equation or membership statement preserves its truth value because &quot;j&quot; is an automorphism. Make such an application to each atomic formula in formula_234 in such a way that each variable &quot;x&quot; assigned type &quot;i&quot; occurs with exactly formula_236 applications of &quot;j&quot;. This is possible thanks to the form of the atomic membership statements derived from NFU membership statements, and to the formula being stratified. Each quantified sentence formula_237 can be converted to the form formula_238 (and similarly for existential quantifiers). Carry out this transformation everywhere and obtain a formula formula_239 in which &quot;j&quot; is never applied to a bound variable. Choose any free variable &quot;y&quot; in formula_4 assigned type &quot;i&quot;. Apply formula_241 uniformly to the entire formula to obtain a formula formula_242 in which &quot;y&quot; appears without any application of &quot;j&quot;. Now formula_243 exists (because &quot;j&quot; appears applied only to free variables and constants), belongs to formula_228, and contains exactly those &quot;y&quot; which satisfy the original formula
formula_4 in the model of NFU. formula_246 has this extension in the model of NFU (the application of &quot;j&quot; corrects for the different definition of membership in the model of NFU). This establishes that &quot;Stratified Comprehension&quot; holds in the model of NFU.

To see that weak &quot;Extensionality&quot; holds is straightforward: each nonempty element of formula_230 inherits a unique extension from the nonstandard model, the empty set inherits its usual extension as well, and all other objects are urelements.

If formula_187 is a natural number &quot;n&quot;, one gets a model of NFU which claims that the universe is finite (it is externally infinite, of course). If formula_187 is infinite and the &quot;Choice&quot; holds in the nonstandard model of ZFC, one obtains a model of NFU + &quot;Infinity&quot; + &quot;Choice&quot;.

=== Self-sufficiency of mathematical foundations in NFU ===
For philosophical reasons, it is important to note that it is not necessary to work in ZFC or any related system to carry out this proof. A common argument against the use of NFU as a foundation for mathematics is that the reasons for relying on it have to do with the intuition that ZFC is correct. It is sufficient to accept TST (in fact TSTU). In outline: take the type theory TSTU (allowing urelements in each positive type) as a metatheory and consider the theory of set models of TSTU in TSTU (these models will be sequences of sets formula_250 (all of the same type in the metatheory) with embeddings of each formula_251 into formula_252 coding embeddings of the power set of formula_250 into formula_254 in a type-respecting manner). Given an embedding of formula_255 into formula_256 (identifying elements of the base &quot;type&quot; with subsets of the base type), embeddings may be defined from each &quot;type&quot; into its successor in a natural way. This can be generalized to transfinite sequences formula_257 with care.

Note that the construction of such sequences of sets is limited by the size of the type in which they are being constructed; this prevents TSTU from proving its own consistency (TSTU + &quot;Infinity&quot; can prove the consistency of TSTU; to prove the consistency of TSTU+&quot;Infinity&quot; one needs a type containing a set of cardinality formula_258, which cannot be proved to exist in TSTU+&quot;Infinity&quot; without stronger assumptions). Now the same results of model theory can be used to build a model of NFU and verify that it is a model of NFU in much the same way, with the formula_257&#x27;s being used in place of formula_225 in the usual construction. The final move is to observe that since NFU is consistent, we can drop the use of absolute types in our metatheory, bootstrapping the metatheory from TSTU to NFU.

=== Facts about the automorphism &quot;j&quot; ===
The automorphism &quot;j&quot; of a model of this kind is closely related to certain natural operations in NFU. For example, if &quot;W&quot; is a well-ordering in the nonstandard model (we suppose here that we use Kuratowski pairs so that the coding of functions in the two theories will agree to some extent) which is also a well-ordering in NFU (all well-orderings of NFU are well-orderings in the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory, but not vice versa, due to the formation of urelements in the construction of the model), and &quot;W&quot; has type α in NFU, then &quot;j&quot;(&quot;W&quot;) will be a well-ordering of type &quot;T&quot;(α) in NFU.

In fact, &quot;j&quot; is coded by a function in the model of NFU. The function in the nonstandard model which sends the singleton of any element of formula_261 to its sole element, becomes in NFU a function which sends each singleton {&quot;x&quot;}, where &quot;x&quot; is any object in the universe, to &quot;j&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Call this function &quot;Endo&quot; and let it have the following properties: &quot;Endo&quot; is an injection from the set of singletons into the set of sets, with the property that &quot;Endo&quot;( {&quot;x&quot;} ) = {&quot;Endo&quot;( {&quot;y&quot;} ) | &quot;y&quot;∈&quot;x&quot;} for each set &quot;x&quot;. This function can define a type level &quot;membership&quot; relation on the universe, one reproducing the membership relation of the original nonstandard model.

== History ==

In 1914, Norbert Wiener showed how to code the ordered pair as a set of sets, making it possible to eliminate the relation types of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; in favor of the linear hierarchy of sets in TST. The usual definition of the ordered pair was first proposed by Kuratowski in 1921. Willard Van Orman Quine first proposed NF as a way to avoid the &quot;disagreeable consequences&quot; of TST in a 1937 article titled &quot;New Foundations for Mathematical Logic&quot;; hence the name. Quine extended the theory in his book &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot;, whose first edition was published in 1940. In the book, Quine introduced the system &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot; or &quot;ML&quot;, an extension of NF that included proper classes as well as sets. The first edition&#x27;s set theory married NF to the proper classes of NBG set theory and included an axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension for proper classes. However, J. Barkley Rosser proved that the system was subject to the Burali-Forti paradox.{{sfn|Rosser|1942}} Hao Wang showed how to amend Quine&#x27;s axioms for ML so as to avoid this problem.{{sfn|Wang|1950}} Quine included the resulting axiomatization in the second and final edition, published in 1951.

In 1944, Theodore Hailperin showed that &quot;Comprehension&quot; is equivalent to a finite conjunction of its instances,{{sfn|Hailperin|1944}} In 1953, Ernst Specker showed that the axiom of choice is false in NF (without urelements).{{sfn|Specker|1953}} In 1969, Jensen showed that adding urelements to NF yields a theory (NFU) that is provably consistent.{{sfn|Jensen|1969}} That same year, Grishin proved NF3 consistent.{{sfn|Grishin|1969}} Specker additionally showed that NF is equiconsistent with TST plus the axiom scheme of &quot;typical ambiguity&quot;.{{cn|date=April 2024}} NF is also equiconsistent with TST augmented with a &quot;type shifting automorphism&quot;, an operation (external to the theory) which raises type by one, mapping each type onto the next higher type, and preserves equality and membership relations.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

In 1983, Marcel Crabbé proved consistent a system he called NFI, whose axioms are unrestricted extensionality and those instances of comprehension in which no variable is assigned a type higher than that of the set asserted to exist. This is a predicativity restriction, though NFI is not a predicative theory: it admits enough impredicativity to define the set of natural numbers (defined as the intersection of all inductive sets; note that the inductive sets quantified over are of the same type as the set of natural numbers being defined). Crabbé also discussed a subtheory of NFI, in which only parameters (free variables) are allowed to have the type of the set asserted to exist by an instance of comprehension. He called the result &quot;predicative NF&quot; (NFP); it is, of course, doubtful whether any theory with a self-membered universe is truly predicative.{{According to whom|date=April 2024}} Holmes has {{date?}} shown that NFP has the same consistency strength as the predicative theory of types of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; without the axiom of reducibility.

The Metamath database implemented Hailperin&#x27;s finite axiomatization for New Foundations.{{sfn|Fenton|2015}} Since 2015, several candidate proofs by Randall Holmes of the consistency of NF relative to ZF were available both on arXiv and on the logician&#x27;s home page. His proofs were based on demonstrating the equiconsistency of a &quot;weird&quot; variant of TST, &quot;tangled type theory with λ-types&quot; (TTTλ), with NF, and then showing that TTTλ is consistent relative to ZF with atoms but without choice (ZFA) by constructing a class model of ZFA which includes &quot;tangled webs of cardinals&quot; in ZF with atoms and choice (ZFA+C). These proofs were &quot;difficult to read, insanely involved, and involve the sort of elaborate bookkeeping which makes it easy to introduce errors&quot;. In 2024, Sky Wilshaw formalized a version of Holmes&#x27; proof using the proof assistant Lean, finally resolving the question of NF&#x27;s consistency. Timothy Chow characterized Wilshaw&#x27;s work as showing that the reluctance of peer reviewers to engage with a difficult to understand proof can be addressed with the help of proof assistants.

<doc id="945964" wikidata="Q312874" url="?curid=945964" title="Hermes da Fonseca">
<text>Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca (; 12 May 1855 – 9 September 1923) was a Brazilian field marshal and politician who served as the eighth president of Brazil between 1910 and 1914. He was a nephew of marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, the first president of Brazil, and general João Severiano da Fonseca, patron of the Army Health Service. His parents were the marshal Hermes Ernesto da Fonseca and Rita Rodrigues Barbosa.

== Early life ==
His father was born in Alagoas and, while serving in the army, was transferred to the town of São Gabriel, in Rio Grande do Sul, where Hermes was born, in 1855. When his father was sent to the Paraguayan War, the family returned to Rio de Janeiro.

== Military career ==
In 1871, at the age of 16, he graduated with a degree in Science and Literature and joined the Military School of Praia Vermelha, where he was a student of Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhães, one of the introducers of the positivist ideas of Auguste Comte in Brazil, and thus did not escape the influence of the master, although he did not become an orthodox positivist. Upon graduating, Fonseca served as an assistant to prince Gaston de Orléans, the Count of Eu.

Fonseca supported the proclamation of the Republic by his uncle Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca, and was invited by him to be a field assistant and military secretary after the seizure of power. In ten months, he went from captain to lieutenant colonel.

On the occasion of the 1893 Naval Rebellion, he stood out, in Niterói, in the command of the defense of the government of Floriano Peixoto. In 1894, he was promoted to colonel, in 1896 he commanded the 2nd Mounted Artillery Regiment, then was appointed head of the Military Cabinet. He commanded the Federal Capital Police Brigade, currently the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro state, between 1899 and 1904, when he took command of the Military School of Realengo, which formed the officers of the army.

As commander of the Realengo Preparatory School in 1904, he repressed the Vaccine Revolt, a movement that, in the name of individual freedom, protested against the compulsory vaccination against smallpox imposed in Rio de Janeiro, also showing the broader popular dissatisfaction with the regime. Fonseca commanded the 1st Military Region, in Rio de Janeiro, from 24 December 1904 to 7 July 1906. Then president Rodrigues Alves promoted him to marshal.

Fonseca held various government positions until he became Minister of War during the government of president Afonso Pena (1906–1909), from 15 November 1906 to 27 May 1909. During his term, at the suggestion of the Baron of Rio Branco, he sent Brazilian officers for training in the German Empire, who, after returning to Brazil, became known as the &quot;Young Turks&quot; . He also reformed the Army and the Ministry of War with the creation of large permanent units, known as the &quot;Strategic Brigades&quot;, and technical and administrative services. Out of these innovations, the most important one was the institution of compulsory military service with the Sortition Law of 1908. However, the law was only &quot;de facto&quot; implemented in 1916. Due to the discussion in the Chamber of Deputies about the participation of the military in the political life of the country, he resigned. He was later minister of the Supreme Military Tribunal (later the Superior Military Court).

== Presidential election of 1910 ==

In November 1908, after returning from a trip to Germany, where he had witnessed military maneuvers as a guest of Kaiser Wilhelm II, he was nominated for presidential succession. He had the support of president Nilo Peçanha, who replaced Afonso Pena, and state representatives at the National Congress, except for the representatives of São Paulo and Bahia, who supported senator Ruy Barbosa and the president of São Paulo state, Albuquerque Lins, as Barbosa&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate. Barbosa launched the Civilist Campaign for the presidency.

For the first time in the republican regime in Brazil, an electoral campaign climate was established with the dispute between the so-called &quot;civilists&quot; and the &quot;hermists&quot;. With the invitation of Nilo Peçanha to return to the Ministry of War, Fonseca strengthened his position and won the 1910 election against Ruy Barbosa.

In the 1910 election on 1 March 1910 the country was divided: Bahia, São Paulo, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and part of Minas Gerais, supported Ruy Barbosa, who had the president of São Paulo, Albuquerque Lins, as his running mate; the other states supported Hermes da Fonseca, who had Venceslau Brás as his vice president. Hermes and Vencesláu Brás won. Hermes had 403,867 votes against 222,822 votes given to Ruy Barbosa. According to the Superior Electoral Court itself, however, the election of Fonseca took place at the cost of fraud (recurring at the time), that is, the tampering of the result, facilitated by the fact that Hermes da Fonseca was supported by the then president Nilo Peçanha.

After being elected, Fonseca traveled to Europe, where he witnessed the fall of the monarchy in Portugal.

Hermes da Fonseca faced, in the first week of his government, in November 1910, the Revolt of the Lash, planned for about two years and which culminated in a mutiny of the sailors in the battleships &quot;Minas Gerais&quot;, &quot;São Paulo&quot;, &quot;Deodoro&quot; and the cruiser &quot;Bahia&quot;. The revolt was led by João Cândido Felisberto. After the mutineers achieved their objective, ending the application of the lash punishments in the Navy, and the granting of amnesty to all the more than two thousand mutinous sailors, the government betrayed them and began a process of expulsion of sailors. The first mutiny, now under control, was followed by an uprising in the Marines battalion without apparent cause. President Hermes then ordered the bombardment of the ports and placed the country under a state of exception. More than 1,200 sailors were expelled and hundreds were arrested and killed. Despite being quite popular when elected, Hermes&#x27; image was greatly shaken after the revolt. Two years later, another revolt came to disrupt his presidency, the Contestado War, which was not quelled until the end of his government.

During his presidency, the so-called Salvation Policy was carried out, which, either through electoral maneuvers or the use of military force, tried to promote federal interventions in the states of São Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Pernambuco, Bahia, Piauí, Ceará and Alagoas, claiming the intention was to put an end to state political schemes and the practice of corruption, appointing new rulers to support his government. It was, therefore, a centralist policy. Despite being successful in the states of Pernambuco, Bahia and Alagoas, the Salvation Policy provoked violent popular and political opposition and caused a rupture in his relations with senator Pinheiro Machado, who was in favor of the &quot;status quo&quot;. Many elements of state politics engaged in armed struggle and managed to defeat the government, with the most violent fighting taking place in Ceará, where state politicians allied with the popular Catholic priest Cícero Romão to oppose government intervention in what became known as the Juazeiro Sedition.

In his government, there was a new renegotiation of the Brazilian foreign debt, in 1914, with a second funding loan (the first had been negotiated by Campos Sales), as Brazil&#x27;s financial situation was not going well. His foreign policy maintained the rapprochement with the United States, outlined by the chancellor, the Baron of Rio Branco, who continued as minister of Foreign Affairs until 1912, when he died.

Internally, the program for the construction of railways continued, including the Madeira-Mamoré railroad and technical-professional schools, outlined in the Afonso Pena government. The University of Paraná was created. Fonseca also completed the renovations and works of the Vila Militar de Deodoro and the Central Hospital of the Army, among others, in addition to the workers&#x27; villages in Rio de Janeiro, in the suburb of Marechal Hermes and in the neighborhood of Gávea.

With the increasing union mobilizations in Rio de Janeiro, president Hermes took an attitude hitherto unheard of in the First Brazilian Republic, which tended to repress union movements; In 1912, by transporting and providing facilities, he sponsored the holding of the Fourth Brazilian Workers Congress, which had been organized by his son, then deputy Mário Hermes. Such government action, however, was viewed with suspicion by union leaders, who disliked the so-called &quot;yellow&quot; unionist current, which sought collaboration with the government.

He was the only president to marry during the presidential term, his first wife, Orsina Francioni da Fonseca, whom he married on 16 April 1879, died on 30 November 1912. His second wife was the caricaturist Nair de Tefé von Hoonholtz, daughter of the Baron of Tefé. Nair would later be considered a feminist; she took part in the first celebrations of the International Women&#x27;s Year. The civil and religious ceremonies took place on 8 December 1913, at the Rio Negro Palace, in Petrópolis.

During his government, a decree was issued instituting the use of the presidential sash in Brazil. Hermes da Fonseca was the first president to use it and the first to pass it on to his successor. Since then, all presidents have received it on inauguration.

Hermes da Fonseca is one of the only three military officers who reached the presidency of the republic in a direct and electoral way. The other two were Eurico Gaspar Dutra and Jair Bolsonaro. Throughout his tenure he was in military uniform, including during ministerial meetings.

== Later years ==
Upon leaving the presidency, in November 1914, he ran for the Senate for Rio Grande do Sul, but refused to assume the chair, due to the murder of Pinheiro Machado, on the day he was supposed to be inaugurated, in September 1915. He then traveled to Europe, moving away from politics, and only returned to Brazil in 1920, after living in Switzerland for six years, when a new presidential campaign began.

Affectionately welcomed by the military, he was led to the presidency of the Military Club in 1921. In this condition he came into conflict with the government of Epitácio Pessoa by honoring the political forces that supported Nilo Peçanha&#x27;s candidacy, in the &quot;republican reaction&quot; movement, and getting involved in the failed military revolt of 1922, known as the Copacabana Fort revolt.

During the 1922 presidential election, fake letters with offensive content directed at Hermes da Fonseca, where he was called &quot;a sergeant without composure&quot;, were attributed to Artur Bernardes, which caused immense turmoil in those elections.

Fonseca&#x27;s arrest was then ordered by president Epitácio Pessoa on 2 July 1922. The following day he was released by order of the same president Epitácio. Arrested again on July 5, accused of conspiracy in the revolt that began on that date in Rio de Janeiro, he spent six months in prison, released on &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in January 1923. Sick, he retired to Petrópolis, staying with his in-laws, the barons of Tefé. There he died on 9 September 1923. He was buried in the city&#x27;s cemetery.

<text>Venceslau Brás Pereira Gomes (26 February 1868 – 15 May 1966) was a Brazilian politician who served as ninth president of Brazil between 1914 and 1918, during the First Brazilian Republic. Brás was born in Brasópolis (formerly São Caetano da Vargem Grande), Minas Gerais State. He became governor of that state in 1909, and in 1910 he was elected vice-president under Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca. As the sixth vice president of Brazil, he also served as the President of the Senate. He was elected president in 1914 and served until 1918. His government declared war on the Central Powers in October 1917 during World War I. He was the longest-lived Brazilian president, reaching 98 years of age.

==Spelling of name==
Throughout his life Brás spelled his name &quot;Wenceslau Braz&quot;, although there exist postage stamps with the spelling &quot;Wenceslao&quot; as well. The 1943 reform of Portuguese orthography stipulates that the names of deceased persons must be spelled according to standard Portuguese spelling rules. All Portuguese-language texts about Brás published after 1966 must therefore spell his name &quot;Venceslau Brás&quot;.

<doc id="945987" wikidata="Q7566579" url="?curid=945987" title="South Carolina Exposition and Protest">
<text>The South Carolina Exposition and Protest, also known as Calhoun&#x27;s Exposition, was written in December 1828 by John C. Calhoun, then Vice President of the United States under John Quincy Adams and later under Andrew Jackson. Calhoun did not formally state his authorship at the time, though it was widely suspected and later confirmed.

The document was a protest against the Tariff of 1828, also known as the Tariff of Abominations. It stated also Calhoun&#x27;s Doctrine of nullification, i.e., the idea that a state has the right to reject federal law, first introduced by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in their Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.

== Background ==
After the final vote on the Tariff of 1828, the South Carolina congressional delegation held two caucuses, the second at the home of Senator Robert Y. Hayne. They were rebuffed in their efforts to coordinate a united Southern response and focused on how their state, by itself, would react. While many agreed with George McDuffie that tariff policy could lead to secession at some future date, they all agreed that as much as possible the issue should be kept out of the upcoming presidential election. John C. Calhoun, while not at this meeting, served as a moderating influence. He did not feel that the first step in reducing the tariff was to defeat Adams and his supporters in the upcoming election.

William C. Preston, on behalf of the South Carolina General Assembly asked Calhoun to prepare a report on the present situation of the tariff. Calhoun readily accepted the challenge and in a few weeks time had a 35,000 word draft of what would become his &quot;Exposition and Protest.&quot;

Fearful that &quot;hotheads&quot; such as McDuffie might force the legislature into taking some drastic action against the federal government, Calhoun aimed for a more measured process:

== Document ==
Calhoun&#x27;s &quot;Exposition&quot; was completed late in 1828. In it, Calhoun argued that the tariff of 1828 was unconstitutional because it favored manufacturing over commerce and agriculture. The tariff power, he felt, could be used to generate revenue but not to provide protection from foreign competition for American industries. He believed that the people of a state or several states, acting in a democratically elected convention, had the retained power to veto any act of the federal government that violated the Constitution. The veto, the core of the doctrine of nullification, was explained:

The report also detailed the specific southern grievances over the tariff that led to the current dissatisfaction.&quot;

== Impact ==
On December 19, 1828, the report was presented to the South Carolina House of Representatives, which had five thousand copies of it printed and distributed. The presidential election had occurred, and John Quincy Adams had been defeated by Andrew Jackson. Calhoun, who still had designs on succeeding Jackson as president, was not identified as the author but word soon leaked out. The legislature took no action on the report at that time.

In 1832, as vice president under Jackson, Calhoun went public with his ideas during the nullification crisis. Both that and the political fallout from the Petticoat affair ended friendly relations between Calhoun and Jackson. As a result, Calhoun was replaced as Jackson&#x27;s running mate in the 1832 election by Martin Van Buren. Calhoun resigned the vice presidency in December 1832 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he continued to speak in opposition to the 1828 tariff.

<doc id="946002" wikidata="Q1428832" url="?curid=946002" title="Ator">
<text>Ator refers to a film series of four Italian movies made in the 1980s by director Joe D&#x27;Amato, using the pseudonym David Hills. D&#x27;Amato wrote and directed the first, second, and fourth films in the series, personally disregarding the existence of the third. The character of Ator was played in the first three films by Miles O&#x27;Keeffe, while Eric Allan Kramer played the Son of Ator in the fourth.

Ator is a swordsman, alchemist, scientist, magician, scholar, and engineer with the ability to sometimes produce objects out of thin air (as depicted in &quot;Ator 4&quot;).

== Films ==
=== &quot;Ator l&#x27;invincibile&quot; ===

The first film in the series is &quot;Ator l&#x27;invincibile&quot; released in the year 1982, translated into English as &quot;Ator the Invincible&quot;. It was released in America as &quot;Ator, The Fighting Eagle&quot;. As the film opens, Ator asks his father for permission to marry his sister. Ator&#x27;s father tells Ator that he is adopted and is allowed to marry his sister if he likes. The rest of the film deals with Ator&#x27;s sister being kidnapped by the high priest of the Spider Kingdom and Ator having to go on an epic quest to save her.

=== &quot;Ator 2 – L&#x27;invincibile Orion&quot; ===

1984&#x27;s &quot;Ator 2 – L&#x27;invincibile Orion&quot;, released in America as &quot;The Blade Master&quot; (and in a re-edited TV version years later as &quot;Cave Dwellers&quot;) lends credence to the argument that Joe D&#x27;Amato was using Ator as a ploy to make money from the Conan films. Like its predecessor, it went into production shortly after the theatrical release of the second &quot;Conan&quot; film, &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;, and was released later the same year.

In this film, Ator and his sidekick Thong travel from the mythic &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; to save Ator&#x27;s mentor from an evil warlord. The film ends with Ator destroying an ancient object of power (called in the film the &quot;Geometric Nucleus&quot;) that his mentor was guarding to protect it from falling into the hands of evil men.

Unintentionally comical moments sometimes arise when writer/director Joe D&#x27;Amato has Ator use modern-day technology in the film. For example, Ator storms a castle using a 1980s style hang glider, and later destroys the &quot;Geometric Nucleus&quot; in a nuclear bomb explosion, and the film ends with a mushroom cloud.

The film was a box office and home video failure. An edited version entitled &quot;Cave Dwellers&quot; was featured on a popular episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, causing it to become a cult sensation. The American theatrical cut, &quot;The Blademaster&quot;, now enjoys modest success on home video and DVD as a cult favorite.

=== &quot;Iron Warrior&quot; ===

Joe D&#x27;Amato dropped &quot;Ator&quot; in 1986, around the same time when it became public knowledge that there were no plans to make a third &quot;Conan&quot; film. Instead, in 1987, a new director, Alfonso Brescia, wrote and directed the third &quot;Ator&quot; film, &quot;Iron Warrior&quot;, which follows the same loose plot as &quot;Ator 2 – L&#x27;invincibile Orion&quot;. The film abandons the continuity of the first two films (even so far as to completely contradict Ator&#x27;s established back-story of having been adopted as a baby, instead opening with him playing as a child with a twin brother). Brescia turns the film into an art house picture, utilizing a variety of cinematic techniques and camera tricks to act as symbols or give deeper meaning to the film. Ator&#x27;s character is also drastically changed: here, he has black hair in a ponytail, and speaks roughly 50 words in the entire film.

The film pays homage to a number of popular films from the time, including the first &quot;Superman&quot; film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. The film&#x27;s score is, as with the first of the series, provided by Carlo Maria Cordio - one of his themes for the film is a simple reworking of a very similar cue heard throughout Joe D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Absurd&quot; (also scored by Cordio).

=== &quot;Quest for the Mighty Sword&quot; ===

In 1990, D&#x27;Amato released the final Ator film, &quot;Ator l&#x27;invincible&quot;. Here, Eric Allan Kramer plays Ator and the Son of Ator in a dual role. This is the only film in the series which does not feature Miles O&#x27;Keeffe. It was released in Europe and the United States under a variety of different titles including &quot;Ator III: The Hobgoblin&quot;. The &quot;hobgoblin&quot; suit was recycled from &quot;Troll 2&quot;, which is the reason why this film was released as &quot;Troll 3&quot; in Germany.

<doc id="946004" wikidata="Q622754" url="?curid=946004" title="Asterisk (PBX)">
<text>Asterisk is a software implementation of a private branch exchange (PBX). In conjunction with suitable telephony hardware interfaces and network applications, Asterisk is used to establish and control telephone calls between telecommunication endpoints such as customary telephone sets, destinations on the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and devices or services on voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks. Its name comes from the asterisk (*) symbol for a signal used in dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) dialing.

Asterisk was created in 1999 by Mark Spencer of Digium, which, since 2018, has been a division of Sangoma Technologies Corporation. Originally designed for Linux, Asterisk runs on a variety of operating systems, including NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, macOS, and Solaris, and can be installed in embedded systems based on OpenWrt.

==Features==
The Asterisk software includes many features available in commercial and proprietary PBX systems: voice mail, conference calling, interactive voice response (phone menus), and automatic call distribution. Users can create new functionality by writing dial plan scripts in several of Asterisk&#x27;s own &quot;extensions&quot; languages by adding custom loadable modules written in PHP or C or by implementing &quot;Asterisk Gateway Interface&quot; (AGI) programs using any programming language capable of communicating via the standard streams system (stdin and stdout) or by network TCP sockets.

Asterisk supports several standard VOIP protocols, including the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), and H.323. Asterisk supports most SIP telephones, acting both as registrar and back-to-back user agent. It can serve as a gateway between IP phones and the PSTN via T- or E-carrier interfaces or analog FXO cards. The Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX) protocol, RFC 5456, native to Asterisk, provides efficient trunking of calls between Asterisk PBX systems in addition to distributing some configuration logic. Many VoIP service providers support it for call completion into the PSTN, often because they themselves have deployed Asterisk or offer it as a hosted application. Some telephones also support the IAX protocol.

By supporting a variety of traditional and VoIP telephony services, Asterisk allows deployers to build telephone systems, or migrate existing systems to new technologies. Some sites are using Asterisk to replace proprietary PBXes, others provide additional features, such as voice mail or voice response menus, or virtual call shops, or to reduce cost by carrying both local and long-distance calls over the Internet.

In addition to VoIP protocols, Asterisk supports traditional circuit-switching protocols such as ISDN and SS7. This requires appropriate hardware interface cards, marketed by third-party vendors. Each protocol requires the installation of software modules. In Asterisk release 14 the Opus audio codec is supported.

==Internationalization==
While initially developed in the United States, Asterisk has become a popular VoIP PBX worldwide. It allows having multiple sets of voice prompts identified by language (and even multiple sets of prompts for each language) as well as support for time formats in different languages. Several sets of prompts for the interactive voice response and voice mail features are included with Asterisk: American, British, and Australian English, Canadian French, Japanese, Russian, Mexican Spanish and Swedish. A few novelty prompts are offered, such as jokes and a themed &quot;zombie apocalypse&quot; message for Halloween. Additionally, voice sets are offered for commercial sale in various languages, dialects, and genders.

The default set of English-language Asterisk prompts are recorded by professional telephone voice Allison Smith.

==Derived products==
Asterisk is a core component in many commercial products and open-source projects. Some of the commercial products are hardware and software bundles, for which the manufacturer supports and releases the software with an open-source distribution model.

* AskoziaPBX, a fork of the m0n0wall project, uses Asterisk PBX software to realize all telephony functions.
* AstLinux is a &quot;Network Appliance for Communications&quot; open-source software distribution.
* FreePBX, an open-source graphical user interface, bundles Asterisk as the core of its FreePBX Distro 
* LinuxMCE bundles Asterisk to provide telephony; there is also an embedded version of Asterisk for OpenWrt routers.
* PBX in a Flash/Incredible PBX and trixbox are software PBXes based on Asterisk.
* Elastix previously used Asterisk, HylaFAX, Openfire and Postfix to offer PBX, fax, instant messaging and email functions, respectively, before switching to 3CX.
* Issabel is an open-source Unified Communications software which uses Asterisk for telephony functions. It was forked from the open-source versions of Elastix when 3CX acquired it.
* *astTECS uses Asterisk in its VoIP and mobile gateways.
* Grandstream&#x27;s UCM series of IP-PBX appliances uses Asterisk with a custom web interface.
* E-MetroTel UCX is a system developed by former Nortel engineers, running on Asterisk, designed to work with Nortel&#x27;s digital and IP phones, as well as to integrate with other Nortel equipment. It also works with other products from other vendors, including NEC, Mitel, Avaya, and Cisco. 

Various add-on products, often commercial, are available that extend Asterisk features and capabilities.

The standard voice prompts included with the system are free. A business can purchase matching voice announcements of its company name, IVR menu options and employee or department names (as a library of live recordings of common names or a set of fully customised prompts recorded by the same professional voice talent) at additional cost for seamless integration into the system.

Other add-ons provide fax support, text-to-speech, additional codecs and new features. Some third-party add-ons are free; a few even support embedded platforms such as the Raspberry Pi.

<doc id="946013" wikidata="Q6254581" url="?curid=946013" title="John E. Reinhardt">
<text>John Edward Reinhardt (March 8, 1920 February 18, 2016) was an American ambassador and diplomat. He was the first career diplomat to head the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) and the first Black Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs.

== Early life and army service ==
Reinhardt was born in Glade Spring, Virginia and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee. He attended segregated schools growing up. After graduating from Knoxville College in 1939, he attended the University of Chicago, initially pursuing a graduate degree in English, but did not finish on account to serving in World War II. He taught at Fayetteville State University from 1941 until he was drafted in 1942. 

The army was segregated when Reinhardt served so he was assigned to a Black regiment. He was assigned domestically to protect from terrorist attacks. His regiment was sent to Italy with the 92nd Infantry Division, but Reinhardt was selected to attend Officer Candidate School instead. He was sent to the Dutch East Indies to prepare for a projected invasion of Japan, but the war was largely over by this time. He left the Army with the rank of Staff Sargent.

Reinhardt received his master&#x27;s in 1947 and his doctorate in English in 1950 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He then became a faculty member at Virginia State University.

== Career ==
Reinhardt became a Foreign Service Officer in 1956, joining the USIA. His early positions included tours in Japan, the Philippines, and Iran. In 1966, he was promoted to the USIA Assistant Director for Africa and the Far East.

He was the U.S. ambassador to Nigeria from 1971 to 1975. He was the first African American in this position. Reinhardt said that the hardest part of his tour in Nigeria was justifying the U.S. import of chrome from the white separatist state of Rhodesia.

In 1975, Reinhardt became the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. He was part of the team that helped Rhodesia shift from white-minority to Black-majority rule. President Jimmy Carter appointed Reinhardt to become the director of the USIA in 1977. During his tenure, the agency was renamed the International Communication Agency and grew to include the Voice of America and the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Reinhardt retired from the State Department in 1980.

Reinhardt was a part of many different boards following his retirement, including the American Academy of Diplomacy, Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, the Population Council of America, and the Middle East Institute. He was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1980 to 1987. 

Reinhardt later was a professor of political science at the University of Vermont from 1987 to 1991. In 1988, Reinhardt was honored as a U.S. Institute of Peace Distinguished Fellow. On June 16, 2004 he joined a group of twenty-seven called Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change opposing the Iraq War. 

== Legacy and death ==
Richard T. Arndt, in his book &quot;The First Resort of Kings: American Cultural Diplomacy in the Twentieth Century,&quot; wrote that Reinhardt was, &quot;the real thing, a genuine practicing cultural diplomat.&quot;

Reinhardt died on February 18, 2016 at the age of 95.

<text>Marie-Hélène Prémont (born October 24, 1977) is a Canadian cross-country mountain biker. She is a 6-time Canadian Champion, represented Canada twice at the Olympics (2004, winning a silver medal, and 2008), a Commonwealth Games gold medalist, and from 2004 to 2008 was a regular medal winner on the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup cross country circuit.

==Career==
Born in Quebec City, Quebec, Prémont rode for Oryx/Procycle from 1999–2004, and Mont-Velo/Liken. From June 2004 through 2008, and in 2012 she rode for the Rocky Mountain Bikes race team. For the 2009-2011 seasons, she rode for the Maxxis-Rocky Mountain Team. She has been a member of the Canadian National team since 2000.

She has won the Canadian National Elite Women&#x27;s Championship in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

She won a bronze in the 2003 World Cup circuit in Kaprun, Austria. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, she won a silver medal. She won three silver medals in the 2004 World Cup Circuit in Mont-Sainte-Anne, Quebec, Fort William, Scotland and Livigno, Italy. She won two gold medals in the 2005 World Cup circuit in Spa Francorchamps, Belgium and Mont-Sainte-Anne, Quebec. She won two gold medals in the 2006 World Cup circuit at Mont-Sainte-Anne, Quebec and Schladming, Austria, and a bronze medal in the 2006 World Championships in Rotorua, New Zealand. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, she won the gold medal. She won 3 silver medals in the 2007 World Cup season at Offenburg, Germany, St. Felicien, Quebec, and Maribor, Slovenia, and finished the 2007 World Cup season in 2nd place overall.

She had her best season ever in 2008 with two gold medals at Fort William and Mont-Sainte-Anne, three silver and three bronze medals and claiming first place overall after eight of the nine races of the 2008 WC season. She was the only woman to win a medal in every World Cup race she entered. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, she was forced to retire from the race due to hyperventilation.

She decided to postpone retirement and race again in 2009. By Madrid, she was back to her usual pace, finishing second just 4 seconds back after swapping the lead with Marga Fullana throughout the race. At Mont-Sainte-Anne in the 5th race of 2009, Marie was the victim of a flat and a fork lockout problem that resulted in a 10th-place finish, and a 13th place in XCO#6 at Bromont after some breathing difficulties limited her climbing ability. Marie finished on the podium again in 5th at the final 2009 World Cup Race in Schladming, finishing the World Cup season in 6th place overall.

After a battery of breathing tests in early August 2009, Marie was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma, first occurring at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 (likely ozone induced since the onset was sudden), and continuing to be a problem through most of the 2009 season. She now has a 
therapeutic use exception for the use of a Ventolin inhaler in competition.

2010 was a season that combined good fitness and performance with bad luck. There were podium finishes with a 4th at Offenburg and a silver medal in a tightly contested battle at Windham, NY.

At an April 2011 Rocky Mountain Bicycles press conference in Quebec City, Marie-Hélène announced that she would continue to compete on the World Cup circuit through the 2012 season with a goal of competing at the 2012 London Olympic Games.

2011 saw three podium finishes, in Offenburg, Mont-Sainte-Anne and Windham.

She did not compete in the 2012 Olympics.

On 27 February 2013, she announced that she would be taking a sabbatical from mountain bike racing as she was pregnant with her first child.

She returned to competitive racing in 2014 for two races, the Canada Cup, taking Bronze, and the World Cup in August.

On 5 August 2016, it was announced that Premont will be inducted into The Canadian Cycling Hall of Fame.

She formally announced her retirement from competition on 16 October 2016.

==Personal life==
She lives in Château-Richer, QC.

The 55 km Véloroute Marie-Hélène-Prémont bike trail between Boischatel and Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges is named for Prémont.

<text>Wittering is a village and civil parish in the City of Peterborough unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire, England. The village is about south of the market town of Stamford in neighbouring Lincolnshire and about west of Peterborough&#x27;s urban sprawl.

==History==
The village of Wittering was first attested in 972 AD as Wiðering ige, the settlement of the people of Wiðer. The &quot;people of Wiðer&quot; are believed to be the same as the &quot;Widerigga&quot;, named in the Tribal Hidage that was compiled between 600 and 900 AD. This territory comprised 600 hides, so may have consisted of most of Peterborough and possibly neighbouring areas of Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 it comprised 44 households and was owned by the Abbey of Peterborough.

The Church of England parish church of All Saints was built between 950 – 981 AD. Surviving Anglo-Saxon parts of the building include the south wall of the nave, the east end of the chancel and the very substantial chancel arch.

As originally built the church would have had no aisles. In the middle of the 12th century a Norman north aisle was added, linked with the nave by a two-bay north arcade. The present south doorway of the nave, and the east and south windows of the chancel are late 13th century Decorated Gothic insertions. The ashlar west tower is late 13th or early 14th century. In the 14th century the north aisle was rebuilt and the north chapel was added. The north chapel has an early 14th-century tomb recess. The tall Perpendicular Gothic windows in the south wall of the nave were inserted later in the Middle Ages.

The south porch was added in the 19th century and the stained glass east window was made by C.E. Kempe in 1903. The vestry was added in 1969. Apart from the tower, the church is roofed with Collyweston stone slates. All Saints&#x27; is a Grade I listed building.

The west tower has a ring of six bells. The fourth bell was cast at Leicester in about 1399. The bellfounder Tobias III Norris of Stamford cast the third and fifth bells in 1681. John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast the treble, second and tenor bells in 1974.

All Saints&#x27; parish is now part of a single benefice with the parishes of Barnack with Ufford, Bainton, and Helpston.

==RAF Wittering==
In 1916 the Royal Flying Corps established a military airfield at Wittering. It became RAF Wittering in 1924 and was an important base for RAF Fighter Command in the Second World War.

In 1954 the airfield was enlarged and became a base for Handley Page Victors, which served as part of the UK&#x27;s V bomber nuclear strike force until the 1960s and then as aerial refuelling tankers.

After RAF Strike Command was formed in 1968, RAF Wittering became &quot;The Home of the Harrier&quot;. Since the UK withdrew its Harrier jump jets in 2010, RAF Wittering has been the base for a number of logistics and support units.

<doc id="946030" wikidata="Q311121" url="?curid=946030" title="Artur Bernardes">
<text>Artur da Silva Bernardes (8 August 1875 – 23 March 1955) was a Brazilian lawyer and politician who served the 12th president of Brazil from 1922 to 1926. Bernades&#x27; presidency was marked by the crisis of the First Brazilian Republic and the almost uninterrupted duration of a state of emergency. During his long political career, from 1905 until his death, he was the main leader of the Republican Party of Minas Gerais (PRM) from 1918–1922 until the party&#x27;s closure in 1937, and founder and leader of the Republican Party (PR).

Before his presidency, Bernardes served as president (governor) of Minas Gerais from 1918 to 1922, during which time he founded the current Federal University of Viçosa and prevented American investor Percival Farquhar from exploiting the iron ore deposits in Itabira, cultivating an image of a nationalist and municipalist leader. A &quot;status quo&quot; and &quot;milk coffee&quot; candidate in the 1922 presidential election, Bernardes was the target of fake letters to harm his image and an attempted coup d&#x27;état to prevent his inauguration, the Copacabana Fort revolt. His administration was unpopular in the cities, especially in Rio de Janeiro, and from July 1924 onwards he was attacked by conspiracies and armed uprisings by &quot;tenentist&quot; rebels. 

Bernardes&#x27; attitude towards the opposition was uncompromising and authoritarian. Out of the states that opposed his candidacy, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia had their dominant parties overthrown, and Rio Grande do Sul fell into a civil war, the Revolution of 1923, in which the federal government brokered a peace deal. In the capital, the political police were reorganized into the 4th Auxiliary Police Bureau. Hundreds of rebel military personnel and civilians died in the bombing of São Paulo and the penal colony of Clevelândia. No amnesty was granted to the rebels. The government repressed militant workers, especially anarchists, while simultaneously enacting some labor laws.

The administration also applied an economic policy of austerity and monetary contraction, fighting inflation and currency devaluation, withdrew Brazil from the League of Nations, carried out a centralizing constitutional reform, the only one to the Brazilian Constitution of 1891, and brought the State closer to the Catholic Church. After his presidency, Bernardes took part in the Revolutions of 1930 and 1932, and saw the PRM reduced to a minority faction in Minas Gerais. In his last years he participated in the campaign for state monopoly on oil in Brazil. An austere and reserved man, Bernardes was idolized by his followers, the so-called &quot;Bernardists,&quot; and hated by his enemies.

== Early life and family ==
Artur da Silva Bernardes was born on 8 August 1875 in the village of Santa Rita do Turvo, currently the municipality of Viçosa, as recognized in history books. His birthplace is disputed by the municipality of Cipotânea, where it is claimed that the future president was born there, at the time part of Alto Rio Doce, and then moved to Viçosa, an already constituted city, at the age of 5. Bernardes was the fourth of nine children born to Antônio da Silva Bernardes and Maria Aniceta Bernardes. One of his brothers, Olegário, would become justice of the Federal Court of Audits, state deputy in Rio de Janeiro, and mayor of Teresópolis.

Bernardes&#x27; mother descended from the Vieira de Sousa family, one of the coffee nobility families of the Zona da Mata, while his father, a Portuguese immigrant from Castanheira de Pera, was a colonel of Brazil&#x27;s National Guard and lawyer in the districts of Alto Rio Doce, Piranga and Viçosa. In the latter he was the first appointed lawyer and then prosecutor. According to some biographies, Antônio Bernardes did not attend more than primary school in Portugal. The family was wealthy enough to pay for their son&#x27;s education, but did not belong to the local political group.

Bernardes&#x27; strict family education was complemented by the traditional Caraça School, where he was enrolled for secondary studies at the end of 1887, at the age of 12. The Caraça School was one of the most prestigious schools in the country. Gilberto Freyre called it a &quot;sad manor in the mountains&quot;. The school&#x27;s schedule control, restriction of visits, surveillance and punishments left their mark on the children of the Minas Gerais elite. The teachers lived in a cloister and penance and &quot;the paddle passed from class to class, from hall to hall, from playground to playground, leveling everyone with its overwhelming dominance&quot;.

This experience allowed Bernardes to &quot;value disciplinary power as a shaper of minds and bodies for the nation&quot;, in addition to establishing his Catholic religiosity for the rest of his life, while many of his contemporaries flirted with positivism and evolutionism. A favorable biography at the Historic and Geographic Institute of Minas Gerais, of which Bernardes is the patron of a chair, stated that the teachings at Caraça &quot;had a great influence on his moral, religious and public formation: the zeal for the public cause, the scrupulousness in the distribution of government money, the spirit of discipline, order and austerity&quot;. At the other extreme, the anti-Bernardes book &quot;Terra Desumana&quot; (1926), by Assis Chateaubriand, argued that the school instilled in the young Bernardes an authoritarian personality, making him more interested in laws than in human feelings.

At the end of 1889, Bernardes&#x27; family was no longer able to keep him in Caraça due to the impact of the abolition of slavery on Brazil&#x27;s coffee economy. The solution came from his brother-in-law José da Graça Sousa Pereira, an associate at the firm Pena e Graça, where Bernardes got a job. This firm in the Viçosa district of Coimbra intermediated the coffee trade between producers and exporters, exposing Bernardes to the rural world. This experience continued in his next job at the firm Adriano Teles, in Visconde do Rio Branco, where he reached the position of accountant at the age of 18, in 1894. The position was the highest an employee could reach and gave access to confidential information, proving that Bernardes was a trustworthy employee. His life in Rio Branco exposed him to the issue of modernizing agricultural techniques, as the business group advertised Brazilian products abroad.

=== Law and journalism ===
With his family in a better financial condition, Bernardes was able to enroll in the &quot;Externato do Ginásio Mineiro&quot; in Ouro Preto at the end of 1894, taking advantage of a decree from the state government that opened separate enrollments. There he studied for preparatory exams (equivalent to a university entrance exam) while living in a boarding house and working at several newspapers and briefly as a Post and Telegraph courier. Under the influence of his father and the Caraça School, Bernardes later enrolled at the Free Faculty of Law, initially as an attendee student, in 1896, before passing the exams and entering the second year in 1897.

As a law student, Bernardes became friends with his colleague and future political ally Raul Soares de Moura, in addition to meeting other figures of future political relevance in Brazil, such as Fernando de Melo Viana and José Vieira Marques. In March, Bernardes volunteered for the Bias Fortes Patriotic Battalion, in the context of the War of Canudos, but the battalion never went out to fight. National politics had a lot of repercussions in Ouro Preto, then the capital of Minas Gerais. Bernardes was among the admirers of Floriano Peixoto, president of Brazil from 1891 to 1894. The anniversary of the abolition of slavery was commemorated with the creation of the newspaper &quot;Academia&quot;, of which Bernardes was editor.

The following year the Faculty of Law was transferred to Cidade de Minas, currently Belo Horizonte, but Bernardes, Raul Soares and others preferred to be transferred to the Faculty of Law of São Paulo. The new state capital, &quot;where one could smell the clay and fresh paint&quot;, could not compare to the comfort of Ouro Preto. São Paulo offered much better opportunities in public life; the only other alternative for the political elite to a degree in Law was the Faculty of Law of Recife. Of the twelve presidents of the First Brazilian Republic, seven had degrees from the Faculty of Law of São Paulo.

In São Paulo, Bernardes worked as editor for the newspaper &quot;Correio Paulistano&quot;, as member of the Notary&#x27;s Office of senator Álvaro de Carvalho&#x27;s father, and as professor of Portuguese and Latin at the Institute of Sciences and Letters of São Paulo. Bernardes and Raul Soares became friends with another native of Minas Gerais at the faculty, Arduíno Bolívar, and possibly joined an academic secret society, the &quot;Bucha&quot;. During holidays, contact was maintained through letters, and during one of these periods, in 1899, Bernardes gained fame defending a defendant in the Viçosa criminal court. The accuser was his father. Upon receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Legal and Social Sciences in December 1900, he pursued a career as attorney. Prestigious among his peers, Bernardes was chosen for the graduation speech. After arriving in his native Viçosa, Bernardes was welcomed with a demonstration at the train station and a ball. A bachelor&#x27;s degree in Law raised his social status. The district had few qualified lawyers, and his professional colleagues had a strong presence in the Brazilian republican state, as they intermediated public and private interests.

At the age of 25, still in 1900, Bernardes opened a law firm in Viçosa. Shortly afterwards, his father resigned from his position as prosecutor to avoid a conflict of interest with his son&#x27;s career. The next two years were filled with constant travels to neighboring cities. In addition to law, Bernardes started working at the weekly newspaper &quot;Cidade de Viçosa&quot;, owned by a local political leader, senator Carlos Vaz de Melo, leader of local directories and supporters of the Republican Party of Minas Gerais (PRM), the only one in the state. The PRM represented the interests of southern Minas Gerais and the Zona da Mata, and Viçosa was a municipality with significant agricultural production in the Zona da Mata, although it was not among the largest in the region. Bernardes&#x27; interest in politics was visible. Since his academic days, &quot;Cidade de Viçosa&quot; presented him as a member of the local elite and as representative of bourgeois values, and he published several articles in the newspaper, including an article on the revision of Brazil&#x27;s 1891 Constitution in 1901.

=== Marriage and children ===
Bernardes&#x27; passion for Clélia Vaz de Melo, the daughter of Carlos Vaz de Melo, opened the doors to the political world when the senator authorized their marriage, which took place on 15 July 1903. Artur Bernardes was now his father-in-law&#x27;s political heir. Bernardes and Clélia had been dating for a decade, but her father did not allow the marriage before the end of the course. The couple had eight children: Clélia, Artur, Maria da Conceição, Dhalia, Rita, Sylvia, Geraldo and Maria de Pompeia. Of these, Artur Bernardes Filho followed his father&#x27;s career and was a federal deputy, constituent, senator and vice-governor of Minas Gerais, reaching the position of Minister of Industry and Commerce in 1961.

The Vaz de Melo-Bernardes became one of the family groups that dominated, with a certain stability, the zones, regions, electoral districts or municipalities of Minas Gerais. Kinship with at least one other politician can be observed in 51.7% of a sample of 511 Minas Gerais politicians between 1891 and 1930, according to a collective biographical study by Amílcar Vianna Martins Filho. Bernardes was also very typical of the Minas Gerais political class due to his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Law, shared with 61.6% of the sample. 17.6% had secondary education in Caraça.

The family&#x27;s rural properties were directly benefited by some of the fiscal, budgetary and tax decisions praised by &quot;Cidade de Viçosa&quot;, such as the reduction in prices on the Leopoldina Railway. Artur Bernardes appeared in the 1907 Laemmert Almanac as a farmer in the Viçosa region, and throughout his life he was a coffee planter and director-owner of a sugar factory in Ponte Nova. Minas Gerais was an agrarian society, but education and the liberal profession (law) had more direct relationships with the political career.

== Political rise ==

=== City councillor (1904–1907) ===
Bernardes&#x27; participation in elections was not immediate, and he refused an offer from his father-in-law to support a candidacy for federal deputy. Instead, Vaz de Melo assigned his son-in-law to welcome the State President (governor) Francisco Sales and other politicians. Bernardes gradually made contacts and demonstrated his rhetoric. In 1904 he ran for special councillor for the Viçosa district of Teixeiras. Despite his previous statements about reforming the Constitution, in October Bernardes claimed in &quot;Cidade de Viçosa&quot; that he did not want elected positions and only appeared on the PRM ticket at the last minute, &quot;yielding to the orders of friends in the District&quot;.

On 19 November, the District&#x27;s 52 voters unanimously elected him. Carlos Vaz de Melo died three days later, and Bernardes succeeded him as director of &quot;Cidade de Viçosa&quot; in January, which began covering extra-municipal issues and supporting the councillor&#x27;s political opinions. On the first day of the year Bernardes published yet another defense of the reform of the Constitution, promising that &quot;this newspaper will be a fierce and merciless fight against the idea, promoted by some, of changing nothing in the fundamental law&quot;. This ambition would be realized two decades later, when Bernardes assumed the presidency. The program presented in the article was to enhance the municipalities and defend the interests of farming, commerce and industry. Other articles discussed the issues of local coffee farming and production alternatives, representing the interests of producers and traders. His speech was compatible with that of state president João Pinheiro, whose agenda included encouraging education and polyculture.

In June 1905 Bernardes was appointed colonel of the National Guard, which legitimized his local power and conferred honors and privileges. Elected president of the City Council the following month, he preferred to remain vice-president. The following year he was elected again, accepted and was invested as executive agent, a position equivalent to mayor. The executive agent was chosen by the City Council. At a Congress of Municipalities held in Leopoldina, in October 1907, Bernardes was invited by deputy Ribeiro Junqueira to give a speech on behalf of the heads of the Executive in the region.

This rapid rise was not accepted by all veterans; José Teotônio Pacheco, Viçosa&#x27;s political leader and former ally of Vaz de Melo, broke his ties with Bernardes and led the municipal opposition. The &quot;&quot;Bernardistas&quot; and &quot;Pachequistas&quot; vied for power in Viçosa for a decade. In the election of a councillor in 1906 and in the renewal of the entire City Council at the end of the following year, the &quot;Bernardists&quot; won by a small margin of votes. &quot;Cidade de Viçosa&quot; accused the &quot;Pachequistas&quot; and their newspaper &quot;A Reação&quot; of lacking patriotism and republicanism. Bernardes exchanged letters with João Pinheiro, pledging his support and making several requests to Viçosa.

=== Deputy and secretary of finance (1907–1918) ===
His deceased father-in-law&#x27;s prestige was still enough for Bernardes to be included in the PRM&#x27;s list of candidates for state deputy and elected for the second district in March 1907. In the state Chamber, he was elected secretary of the board in 1907 and 1908, gave speeches about agriculture issues and helped approve João Pinheiro&#x27;s tax reform. This last position facilitated his nomination to run for federal deputy in 1909. The candidates for Minas Gerais&#x27; federal deputy positions were colonels or intellectuals, both chosen by the state president and the PRM&#x27;s Executive Committee, known as &quot;Tarasca&quot;&quot;, made up mostly of politicians from the southern Minas Gerais. The party prided itself on promoting the careers of young politicians. Its rule was elitist and centralized, controlling political appointments, pressuring the press, co-opting pressure groups and securing their votes through &quot;coronelism&quot; and fraud. Being chosen as a PRM candidate was equivalent to being elected.

Francisco Bernardino Rodrigues Silva, a lawyer from Juiz de Fora and previous occupant of the seat, ran as an independent candidate against Bernardes, with the support of Viçosa&#x27;s &quot;Pachequistas&quot;. In January 1909, Silva obtained more votes than his rival, but a Commission for the Recognition of Powers, whose rapporteur was Altino Arantes, stripped 2,552 votes from Bernardes in Viçosa and 3,339 from Silva in Juiz de Fora. Under orders from the PRM, the Chamber of Deputies approved the decision and Bernardes was awarded more than a thousand votes above his competitor. According to Afonso Arinos de Melo Franco, the PRM confirmed Bernardes because he was &quot;a young and energetic leader&quot;, an &quot;experienced commander of officialdom in one of the toughest municipal struggles in Zona da Mata&quot;.

In this first period in the Chamber of Deputies, Bernardes did not stand out nor took part in the technical committees. His greatest achievement was in Viçosa, where he secured presidential candidate Hermes da Fonseca the majority of votes in the 1910 presidential election.

On 7 September 1910, Bernardes resigned his position as federal deputy and returned to Belo Horizonte to take over the state&#x27;s Finance Secretariat, after being appointed by state president Júlio Bueno Brandão. Minas Gerais had one of the largest economies in the country, and therefore the position further boosted Bernardes&#x27; career. His management focused on increasing revenue, creating tax collection offices, negotiating the taxation of mining products shipped through São Paulo and Espírito Santo, and reorganizing the Minas Gerais Receipt Office in Rio de Janeiro. These measures still had a regionalist bias, avoiding harming the interests of coffee growing in Zona da Mata.

During this period, the State Employees&#x27; Beneficial Bank and the &quot;Banco Hipotecário e Agrícola&quot;, the future Bank of the State of Minas Gerais, were created. In 1911, new types of long-term loans to municipalities benefited administrations in Zona da Mata and southern Minas Gerais, in a municipalist policy that would yield electoral dividends. Bernardes left the secretariat at the end of Bueno Brandão&#x27;s government, in September 1914, and in the following January he was the candidate for federal deputy with the most votes in the district. In this second period in the Chamber of Deputies he chaired the Special Committee on the Accounting Code.

== President of Minas Gerais (1918–1922) ==
At the beginning of 1917, deputy Gomes Lima met Bernardes in Viçosa to report that Américo Lopes, Secretary of the Interior of state president Delfim Moreira, had been chosen as the PRM candidate for the state government. Bernardes confirmed his acceptance in a letter to the president. Américo Lopes was the candidate of former senator and state president Francisco Sales, president of the PRM&#x27;s Executive Committee and leader of one of the three factions that existed in the party until 1918. The other two were the followers of Bias Fortes, called &quot;&quot;Biistas&quot; and Silviano Brandão&#x27;s, the &quot;viuvinhas&quot;&quot;. Zona da Mata politicians were usually supporters of Sales. Américo Lopes&#x27; name was contested by Raul Soares, the Secretary of Agriculture, who felt that his Zona da Mata region (he was from Ubá) was discredited. Arguing the moral incapacity of the secretaries&#x27; candidacy, especially that of the Interior, Soares convinced president Venceslau Brás, who was from Minas Gerais, to veto the candidacy. The result was a list of candidates, but it omitted Bernardes. Still feeling that Zona da Mata was overlooked, Soares then convinced the president to support Bernardes.

The name was accepted by state president Delfim Moreira and made official by the Executive Committee in June, reuniting the party. Bernardes&#x27; vice president was state senator Eduardo Amaral. Although elected deputy again, Bernardes resigned his position to take office as governor at the Palácio da Liberdade, in Belo Horizonte, in September 1918. His secretariat was set up with illustrious figures: Raul Soares and later Afonso Pena Júnior in the Interior, Afrânio de Melo Franco and later João Luís Alves in Finance and Clodomiro de Oliveira in Agriculture, Industry, Land, Transport and Public Works.

=== Hegemony in the PRM ===
As soon as he took office, Bernardes broke with Sales and his followers, seen by him and Raul Soares as a symbol of the old &quot;coronelism&quot; practices, and therefore a target to be eradicated. With the State apparatus in control, administration positions were handed over to loyal individuals. In the elections, 72% of the State Chamber and 50% of the State Senate were renewed. &quot;Salista&quot; deputies and senators were &quot;beheaded&quot;, that is, their votes were not recognized by the State Chamber. Francisco Sales, who did much for Bernardes&#x27; first steps in his political career, was relegated to ostracism. Their personal feud existed since 7 July 1918 when, at a banquet held for Delfim Moreira, Sales&#x27; speech completely ignored Bernardes, who was at the main table as a Minas Gerais leader.

In February 1919, Bernardes had the &quot;Tarasca&quot; accept his list of candidates for a quarter of the senators and all the deputies. As of the 17 September convention, each delegate could represent no more than five local districts. In the Executive Committee, all former state presidents became perpetual members, three new positions were created and the presidency and secretariat would have to change annually.

Within two years, Bernardes imposed his authority over the &quot;Tarasca&quot; and the colonels. The fight against &quot;coronelism&quot; obviously did not affect his allies, but these were younger, intellectualized leaders, with some connections to the industrial sector and focused on economic development. A true generational transition took place in the PRM. The first generation, responsible for consolidating the Brazilian Republic in Minas Gerais, was replaced by another that entered public life around the 1910s. Southern Minas Gerais lost its predominance in state politics and the Zona da Mata gained prominence. Members of the government now owed allegiance to the state president and not to the PRM&#x27;s Executive Committee.

=== Presidential election of 1919 ===

Two Minas Gerais politicians, Artur Bernardes and Melo Franco, were considered to run for president in the election scheduled for April 1919. For health reasons, the winner of the 1918 election, Rodrigues Alves, never took office, and his vice president Delfim Moreira ruled the country for around eight months until a successor was chosen. Bernardes refused his own candidacy, which would have been of interest to the Minas Gerais elites, and insisted that the three strongest states (Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul) decided on a new name. Several reasons are speculated for his refusal, such as fears of a lack of support from São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul or a bad reaction from public opinion, as a Minas Gerais politician already occupied the presidency, and the inconvenience of interrupting a recently installed administration. It would first be necessary to gather prestige in the state government.

Even without running, Bernardes managed to position himself as the arbiter of the presidential succession. On 9 February, the &quot;Tarasca&quot; invested him with leadership of negotiations in Minas Gerais. João Luís Alves and Raul Soares were his emissaries. On the 25th he presided over the Convention in the Federal Senate building, in Rio de Janeiro, to make Epitácio Pessoa, from Paraíba, official as the &quot;status quo&quot; candidate. São Paulo politicians resented Bernardes for his refusal to support a candidacy by Altino Arantes, president of São Paulo. Pessoa, a neutral candidate between the three largest states, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, was the result of the latter two&#x27;s rejection to Arantes. The proposal for Pessoa&#x27;s name came from Minas Gerais and was accepted by São Paulo. Pessoa&#x27;s victory in the election came as no surprise.

=== Reforms and works ===
The Bernardes state administration privileged the Zona da Mata. Education was a priority in the program and effective advances were made in public secondary and higher education. 13 school groups and 421 isolated schools were built in primary and secondary education. A new regulation for itinerant agricultural education, on 12 July 1920, reinforced the practical education provided by district and rural schools. In higher education, the government created the Institute of Industrial Chemistry and expanded the clinics at the Faculty of Medicine of Belo Horizonte.

A highlight was the creation of the Higher School of Agriculture and Veterinary Science (ESAV), the future Federal University of Viçosa. Bernardes began the creation process with a decree on 6 September 1920. The ESAV&#x27;s headquarters would be in a region with a predominance of small and medium-sized coffee farms in the Zona da Mata, which would depend on agricultural modernization to resist the pressures of coffee valorization policies. The city chosen was Viçosa, precisely the president&#x27;s hometown. According to the book &quot;A Universidade Federal de Viçosa no Século XX&quot;, published by Editora UFV, the school&#x27;s location was not an arbitrary decision by Bernardes and took into account the topography, water availability and proximity to the Leopoldina Railway. Teaching would be along American lines. The inauguration only took place in 1926.

In agriculture, the Bernardes administration granted favors to &quot;Banco de Crédito Real de Minas Gerais&quot; and &quot;Banco Hipotecário e Agrícola&quot;, hoping to alleviate the insolvency of rural cooperatives. The administration lowered export taxes on coffee, livestock and cereals and maintained the coffee price guarantee, which deserved more attention according to the president. At the suggestion of the Executive, on 20 September 1919, legislators approved a reform of the land tax, seeking to curb fraud and evasion in the declaration of land values. Many years ago, this tax was discussed in Minas Gerais as a way of discouraging unproductive large estates, and one of the points of the PRM&#x27;s economic program was the &quot;remodeling of the tax regime, based on territorial and income taxes, with the gradual suppression of the export tax on the State&#x27;s budget revenue&quot;.

A law on the supply of agricultural machinery by the Secretariat of Agriculture was approved in 1919, but would only be effectively put into practice in the following government. For another point of the program, the &quot;settling of the State&#x27;s territory&quot;, four large mixed colonies of German immigrants and Brazilian farmers were founded: the Álvaro da Silvera, Bueno Brandão, David Campista and Francisco Sá colonies. The expansion of the road network, mentioned in the program, included the construction of 1,498 kilometers of highways, 138 bridges, subsidies for other highways and the government&#x27;s acquisition of the Paracatu and Goiás Railways. The State&#x27;s real estate assets and revenue grew and a large part of its debt was paid off.

=== The iron issue ===
Bernardes&#x27; industrial ambition was to transform the Rio Doce Valley into Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Ruhr Valley&quot;, a complex of mines, railways, steel mills and ports from Minas Gerais to Espírito Santo. Minas Gerais had large unused iron ore deposits, and Brazil&#x27;s steel production was incipient. Bernardes and Raul Soares wanted a steel industry and were against the simple export of iron ore. The model intended by Secretary of Agriculture Clodomiro de Oliveira consisted of small plants powered by electricity, charcoal and mineral coal from Santa Catarina, with technology from the Mining School of Ouro Preto, where Oliveira was a professor. The use of charcoal brought with it the issue of deforestation, of which Bernardes was aware. His speeches outlined his concern with the &quot;conservation of forests and reforestation of the State, threatened with seeing large portions of its territory transformed into bare and barren zones&quot;.

In September 1919, the Minas Gerais Congress lowered the iron ore export tax for companies that transformed at least 5% of the exported amount into iron and steel. Otherwise, the tax would be a hundred times higher. Laws of the same content were approved in the following years. Several steel plants were founded during this period under the stimulus of the state government, all with low production. The exception was the &quot;Companhia Siderúrgica Belgo-Mineira&quot; (CSBM), the first medium-sized integrated steel company in Brazil, whose plant in Sabará began operations in 1925. Although far from making the country self-sufficient, it made Minas Gerais export steel workers to other states. The CSBM was the result of negotiations that began during the visit of king Albert I of Belgium to Brazil in 1920; Bernardes invited him to Minas Gerais to attract Belgian capital, and the state government made an agreement with a Brazilian company, &quot;Companhia Siderúrgica Mineira&quot;, and another Belgian-Luxembourgish company, ARBED.

The attitude of the Minas Gerais government was different towards the trade union of American investor Percival Farquhar, who had acquired shares in the Itabira Iron Ore Company and received approval from the federal government to export iron ore through private lines to the Vitória-Minas Railway and a private port to be built as far as Santa Cruz, in Espírito Santo. In return, Farquhar would install a steel and rolling mill in Santa Cruz, powered by European and American coal. Brazil&#x27;s National Congress took from 1920 to 1928 to debate the contract, and in the meantime Farquhar negotiated another contract with the government of Minas Gerais, as stipulated in the federal contract.

In September 1920, the Minas Gerais Congress authorized the Executive to hire Itabira Iron or another company to install one or more steel plants in the state. Debates between legislators and technicians soured the initial positive attitude, and Clodomiro de Oliveira managed to convince Bernardes to postpone the signing of the contract. The Minas Gerais government doubted the promise of a large steel plant and feared that the company would charge exaggerated prices on the domestic market and create a monopoly on ore transportation. Bernardes adopted a nationalist stance, demanding that foreign companies prove the benefits of their contracts. Even so, his messages to the Minas Gerais Congress did not peremptorily reject Farquhar&#x27;s proposal.

== Presidential election of 1922 ==
=== Pre-candidacy (1919–1921) ===
Since the 1919 election it was clear that Bernardes could become president of Brazil, even if he had to wait for the next election. Prudente de Morais Filho reportedly told Afrânio de Melo Franco that Bernardes would certainly be president of Brazil &quot;because he is from Minas Gerais, he doesn&#x27;t compromise, he is tenacious and always wears well-creased pants&quot;. If Bernardes&#x27; candidacy was obvious, support for it was not, and all the PRM&#x27;s actions at the national level were directed towards the ambition of the presidency.

The Minas Gerais-São Paulo alliance supported the administration of Epitácio Pessoa in Congress. Minas Gerais took advantage of the relative weakness of Epitácio Pessoa, who was from a small state (Paraíba), and although it only received one ministry (that of the Navy, under Raul Soares), it managed to place PRM deputy Astolfo Dutra in the Presidency of the Chamber of Deputies, despite Rio Grande do Sul and Bahia&#x27;s opposition. The São Paulo allies were also competitors, as they had their own pre-candidate, state president Washington Luís. On 21 March 1920, Raul Soares wrote to Bernardes to alert him of São Paulo&#x27;s funding for Minas Gerais opposition newspapers and São Paulo&#x27;s negotiations with Francisco Sales.

Still in 1920, Bernardes sought the support of J. J. Seabra, president of Bahia, sending weapons to defend his government against the armed revolt of colonel Horácio de Matos. This measure was heavily criticized in the press. Another letter from Raul Soares, in July, expressed the fear of an alliance between São Paulo and the federal government around the candidacy of Nilo Peçanha from Rio de Janeiro. In September, Bernardes reconciled a dispute between São Paulo politicians and the president of Brazil regarding the issuance of currency to support coffee. A newspaper at the time assessed that Bernardes prevented Epitácio Pessoa from isolating São Paulo, as he could not give up the alliance.

Negotiations for the presidential succession began early, in the first months of 1921, due to the wear and tear of the federal government in multiple sectors: with the military, the urban population and the oligarchies of Minas Gerais and São Paulo. The PRM launched Bernardes&#x27; candidacy in April and called state leaders to a national convention. São Paulo accepted it on the condition of meeting its economic demands, support from Epitácio Pessoa&#x27;s government and future support for a candidacy by Washington Luís. Epitácio Pessoa accepted Bernardes&#x27; candidacy practically by imposition. In order to attract the northern states, Minas Gerais promised to continue the public works begun under Pessoa&#x27;s administration.

Consensus around the official candidacy was usually easy. Until May, most states had approved Bernardes&#x27; candidacy, with the notable exception of Rio Grande do Sul. The economic promises made to São Paulo were incompatible with Rio Grande do Sul&#x27;s goals, and in the assessment of Minas Gerais politicians, Rio Grande do Sul had become the opposition for being excluded from the choice. The choice of the vice presidential candidate, Urbano Santos, added Pernambuco and Bahia to the opposition, both of which had their own pre-candidates. The convention to approve the official candidacy took place in the Senate on 8 June, with the absence of delegates from Rio Grande do Sul, Pernambuco, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. The loss of Rio de Janeiro was yet another surprise to Minas Gerais, as Nilo Peçanha had previously advised the Republican Party of Rio de Janeiro to support Bernardes&#x27; candidacy, but now stated that the commitment &quot;was premature&quot;, despite the &quot;confidence inspired by Mr. Bernardes and the tradition of Minas Gerais&#x27; politics&quot;.

Of the 192 delegates present, 188 approved the candidacy. From the Senate galleries came boos at Bernardes&#x27; first statements and even imitations of a sheep&#x27;s bleating. Bernardes was already the subject of ridicule for his appearance. Days earlier, &quot;Bernardist&quot; senator Paulo de Frontin had blamed the political instability on &quot;street scoundrels and the ambition of the barracks.&quot;

=== Election campaign ===
The four dissident states joined together in the so-called Republican Reaction to launch the candidacies of Nilo Peçanha for president of Brazil and J. J. Seabra for vice president. The split between the state oligarchies has several explanations in historiography: the issue of the vice presidency, the association with urban dissent, the economic policy exclusively focused on coffee and the Minas Gerais-São Paulo monopoly on State benefits. A third pre-candidate, marshal Hermes da Fonseca, became unfeasible, but his military support then went to the Republican Reaction . On 26 April, Fonseca visited Bernardes at the Palácio da Liberdade, but without any political results.

It was at this point that Bernardes&#x27; political rise stopped being peaceful and he entered the crisis of the First Brazilian Republic, which was going through its last decade. Minas Gerais was running without traditional allies, but the support of the federal government, São Paulo and smaller states gave Bernardes&#x27; candidacy a good chance. Bernardes refused proposals to withdraw his candidacy so that a conciliatory name could be reached. The traditional method of securing votes, distributing favors to oligarchs and colonels from the countryside, gave a clear advantage to the side supported by the federal machine. Nilo Peçanha also used this method, but complemented it with the military and the urban masses, who felt marginalized from the political system. The economic and social situation was deteriorating.

In the second half of the year, fake letters attributed to Bernardes, with insulting comments about Hermes da Fonseca and the military, were published behind the scenes and were even offered to Bernardes himself. The letters were disclosed on 9 October by &quot;Correio da Manhã&quot;. The first letter, addressed to Raul Soares, called Fonseca a &quot;sergeant without manners&quot;, his campaign event an &quot;orgy&quot; and the officers &quot;scoundrels&quot;, &quot;venal&quot; in &quot;almost all of them&quot;. The forgers, Oldemar Lacerda and Jacinto Guimarães, skillfully manipulated the military&#x27;s resentment for the contempt they received from the civilian elite. Bernardes immediately denied authorship of the letters, and Fonseca agreed that they were fake.

At the beginning of the electoral campaign, on the 15th, the &quot;Bernardist&quot; delegation was greeted by boos from a huge crowd in downtown Rio de Janeiro. According to one witness, the protesters &quot;assaulted the cars, insulted the occupants with obscene words, struck the windows and headlights with sticks taken from the trees, and howled like those possessed, in a kind of furious liberation&quot;. Bernardes continued to the traditional candidate presentation banquet, at which he read his platform: a constitutional review at the initiative of Congress, budget balance, currency appreciation and the protection of coffee and industry. These proposals were not that different from those of Nilo Peçanha.

The campaign was fierce, involving personal attacks and satires. For the Republican Reaction, Bernardes&#x27; candidacy was an imposition of the oligarchies on the people. The press was polarized between the two candidates and exchanged insults and accusations. Bernardes received the popular nicknames &quot;&quot;Seu Mé&quot; (Mr. Mé), for his sharp profile, similar to a ram, and &quot;rolinha&quot;&quot;, for his thinness. Only Hermes da Fonseca, during the 1910 presidential election, was more ridiculed. The carnival song &quot;Ai, Seu Mé&quot;, very popular during the 1922 Carnival, warned that &quot;there at the Palácio das Águias&quot; (Catete), &quot;he [Bernardes] shall not set his foot&quot;. Bernardes&#x27; supporters almost lynched former deputy Maurício de Lacerda when he landed in Juiz de Fora, on 24 January 1922, and the Minas Gerais police did not intervene.

The issue of the fake letters radicalized the military, a segment that was already dissatisfied. The Military Club, chaired by Hermes da Fonseca, created a commission to study the authenticity of the letters. Under pressure from anti-Bernardists, it confirmed the authenticity of the first letter on 28 December 1921, despite evidence of fraud pointed out by experts. The report proposed handing the judgment over to the nation, that is, to the polls. Other oppositionists argued that &quot;if the letters were fake, their thought was true&quot;. Disciplinary incidents and punishments began in the Brazilian Army even before the election, with soldiers openly positioning themselves in favor of Nilo Peçanha and against Bernardes. Some were already thinking about a coup d&#x27;état.

=== Contested results ===
The election, held on 1 March 1922, gave 466,972 votes to Artur Bernardes against 317,714 for Nilo Peçanha, a narrow and surprising margin by the standards of the First Republic. Peçanha accused the results of fraud, proclaimed himself a &quot;moral winner&quot; and proposed a &quot;Court of Honor&quot;, with five representatives from Congress and five from the Supreme Federal Court (STF), to determine the fairness of the election. Outgoing president Epitácio Pessoa and some &quot;status quo&quot; leaders even considered the proposal, but Minas Gerais ones refused it. On 1 May, Pessoa gathered his military ministers and representatives from São Paulo and Minas Gerais to discuss the situation, which according to him, was getting out of control.

To fight the military conspiracy, untrustworthy officers had been transferred away from the capital. The forgers of the letters had confessed to the fraud, and most officers accepted Bernardes&#x27; explanations. Still, some low ranking officers devised coup plots. But Pessoa still believed that Bernardes should resign, as &quot;he won&#x27;t last 24 hours at Catete&quot;. Bernardes refused, saying he was elected &quot;in the most disputed and free of presidential elections&quot;. Congress proclaimed his victory on 7 June.

The attempted coup, or revolution, would come to be known as the first episode of the &quot;tenentist&quot; movement. Still politically immature, it was led by a portion of the army&#x27;s young officers who were dissatisfied with society, the role the army played in it and the conduct of civilian politicians, including Bernardes. The revolt began on 5 July and was much smaller than expected by the conspirators, being limited to a few units in Rio de Janeiro, Niterói and Mato Grosso. Loyalist forces promptly restored control. The shocking spectacle of the last rebels from Fort Copacabana, who fell in combat in a suicidal march along Atlântica Avenue, changed the political climate and served as an inspiration for future revolts.

In response, Congress approved the declaration of a state of emergency in the Federal District and the state of Rio de Janeiro, which was preventatively extended until 31 December. Police repression, including the closure of &quot;Correio da Manhã&quot;, secured the remainder of Pessoa&#x27;s term. On the 9th, Bernardes asked Afrânio de Melo Franco to insist to the president of Brazil to &quot;take all the advantages&quot; of the state of emergency. &quot;Among other things, he [the president] should, in my opinion, arrest the rioters and idlers who infest Rio and Niterói, and deport them far away, to Acre, for example.&quot; On 7 September, Bernardes handed over the Minas Gerais government to Raul Soares. The day before, he promoted a large number of officers from the Public Force of Minas Gerais. Throughout his administration, investments in training and equipment had won the sympathy of the officers of this military force, whose soldiers would be nicknamed &quot;Bernardes&#x27; henchmen&quot; in the following years.

On 15 November 1922, the first presidential inauguration under a state of emergency in Brazilian history took place. The inauguration party had a heavy armed escort from the Public Force of Minas Gerais. As a security measure, the oath ceremony took place in the Chamber of Deputies rather than the Senate. Estácio Coimbra took office as vice president, after a new election was held following the unexpected death of Urbano dos Santos in May.

== Presidency (1922–1926) ==
===Cabinet===
Bernardes handed the ministries to Rafael de Abreu Sampaio Vidal (Finance), João Luís Alves (Interior), Félix Pacheco (Foreign Affairs), Francisco Sá (Transport and Public Works), Miguel Calmon (Agriculture), Setembrino de Carvalho (War) and Alexandrino de Alencar (Navy). The selection represented broad civilian support. In the War Ministry, it was difficult to find a loyal name to the government and respected among its peers.

Bernardes arrived isolated and embittered in the federal capital, an unknown environment full of threats. His administration was unpopular in Rio de Janeiro and in urban areas in general due to the rise in the cost of living, which doubled between 1921 and 1923, according to some imprecise calculations. The cause was the policy of coffee appreciation, which inflated the economy and depreciated the exchange rate. The country was divided and the government had enemies in the urban middle classes, military &quot;tenentists&quot;, workers and dissident state oligarchies.

=== State crises ===
Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Bahia, former members of the Republican Reaction, all had internal political crises, with risks of federal intervention and local oppositions that sought support from Bernardes. Strengthened, the federal Executive obtained favorable state presidents in all three. The predominant interpretation in memoirs and historiography is that Bernardes was vengeful. Even his defenders admitted that the interventions were &quot;preemptive&quot;, planned in advance. According to the interpretation of Brazilianist Eul-Soo Pang, Bernardes replaced the &quot;governors&#x27; policy&quot; with the &quot;presidents&#x27; policy&quot;, in which the federal Executive was the arbiter of state disputes.

In the first days of January 1923, STF president Hermínio Francisco do Espírito Santo sought out Bernardes and the Minister of the Interior to discuss Rio de Janeiro. Raul Fernandes, a &quot;Nilist&quot; (ally of Nilo Peçanha), had taken office as state president, secured by federal troops and a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; from the Supreme Court. The opposition, which did not recognize the election results, installed Feliciano Sodré in the same position, thus creating a parallel government. Violence spread throughout Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s countryside, where &quot;Nilist&quot; Municipal Councils were deposed. Hermínio Espírito Santo was convinced that &quot;habeas corpus&quot; had already been fulfilled and municipal authorities were not protected by it.

In response, Bernardes decreed federal intervention in the state of Rio de Janeiro on 10 January, &quot;considering that the State of Rio currently has two governments&quot;, reigning &quot;a permanent state of disorder&quot;. The federal government was not exempt; its authorities boycotted Raul Fernandes and his supporters, and police officers from the Federal District participated in the depositions of municipal authorities. The intervention decree installed Aurelino Leal as head of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s government, a position he took advantage of to dismantle the &quot;Nilist&quot; political machine. The decision to intervene in Rio de Janeiro was much discussed and even the STF itself debated whether to issue a note of protest for non-compliance with its &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Contemporary jurists and politicians approved the intervention, but biographers of those involved tried to exempt their responsibilities. Raul Soares had written to Bernardes in December warning against the idea, as it would be an &quot;act of force that is repugnant to our legalist spirit&quot;. According to Aurelino Leal, Bernardes regretted &quot;directly affecting a man as distinguished as Raul Fernandes&quot;, and said he &quot;would like to see what Nilo will say to all this&quot;.

In Rio Grande do Sul, Bernardes did not dare to intervene, despite the ongoing Revolution of 1923, a civil war in which with the opposition waged a rural guerrilla against the government of Borges de Medeiros. The Republican Party of Rio Grande do Sul was rooted in power and protected by the state&#x27;s Military Brigade. The Federal Army remained neutral, although biased towards the opposition. The Pact of Pedras Altas, brokered by the Minister of War in December, amnestied the rebels and prohibited Medeiros&#x27; re-election. Borges de Medeiros gained a few additional years in power, at the cost of a pledge of loyalty to Bernardes.

In Bahia, the conflict was not so large, but federal troops secured the inauguration of state president Góis Calmon in March 1924, ending the rule of J. J. Seabra. Later, from December to February, Bernardes did not support Calmon in his military expeditions against Horácio de Matos, a powerful colonel from Chapada Diamantina. Matos and Bernardes were linked through Francisco Sá Filho, a federal deputy for Minas Gerais and son of the Minister of Transport. Bernardes pressured Bahia&#x27;s president using his brother, the Minister of Agriculture, and Matos continued to rule his &quot;state within the state&quot;.

=== July revolts ===
Amnesty was the common outcome in Brazilian republican military seditions. The Bernardes administration refused it to those responsible for the revolt of 5 July 1922 and the STF indicted 50 of them in December 1923. Eleven of them, fugitives, were the nucleus of a new armed conspiracy, the São Paulo Revolt, which emerged in July 1924. Rebel elements of the army and Public Force plunged the city of São Paulo into a prolonged urban combat. The leader of the movement, general Isidoro Dias Lopes, proclaimed himself head of a &quot;Provisional Government&quot;. The revolutionary manifestos clarified that the movement was national in scope, not regional, accused Bernardes of despotism, and demanded his resignation. Military revolts spread to other states; in July alone, they broke out in Mato Grosso, Sergipe, Amazonas and Pará.

Censorship controlled news about the conflict, but it was &quot;possible to see, between the lines of the newspapers that, despite remaining firmly at the helm, Bernardes is dangerously navigating through the obstacles of a military crisis that could spread all over the country&quot;. By 12 July, foreign diplomats were hearing rumors that he would resign. A boat moored at the back of the Catete Palace had a crew always on standby. In São Paulo, the factories stopped, hungry mobs looted stores, and the specter of a popular revolution loomed. Loyalist artillery indiscriminately bombarded rebel territory. At the end of the conflict, the city council counted 503 dead and 4,846 injured, of which two thirds were civilians. The government rejected humanitarian calls to halt the bombing.

Writer Monteiro Lobato sent a letter to Bernardes after his birthday, on 9 August. After saying that none of Brazil&#x27;s presidents was &quot;less understood in their honest intentions&quot;, Lobato warned that &quot;the mood of the Brazilian people is one of open revolt&quot;. After the rebels left São Paulo, on 27 July, &quot;the legal troops parade through the city and the people do not hail them as liberators (...) Absolute indifference. German army entering Paris...&quot; In his response, Bernardes partly blamed immigrants in the São Paulo working class for the &quot;lack of a more prompt civic reaction&quot;.

The president spared no resources in combating &quot;tenentism&quot; and could not understand the hostility he received. In a letter to a friend, Bernardes wrote that &quot;ambitious politicians and bad citizens have not left me time to work&quot;. Years later he declared that &quot;tenentism&quot; was a movement &quot;without a known program or objectives other than those of a personal nature. They were revolts prepared even before I took over the government and I think they were aimed at me then&quot;. According to his &quot;Manifesto to the Nation&quot; of November 1924, the &quot;real, unconfessed causes are the unruly ambition of power and the possession of the Public Treasury&quot;. Historians of &quot;tenentism&quot; recognized that there was indeed a political program in the movement, vaguely nationalist in character, demanding freedom of the press, secret voting and overcoming the old political oligarchies, of which Bernardes would be the icon, the &quot;symbol of the perversion of the Republic&quot;.

=== The Prestes Column ===

On 4 November, conspirators in the Brazilian Navy took control of the battleship &quot;São Paulo&quot;, creating panic in the Catete Palace when the ship was spotted in an attack position. Bernardes, already a veteran of these crises, was not bothered: &quot;everyone can leave if they want, including my family. I, however, will remain here in defense of the regime of which I am a representative&quot;. As a precautionary measure, the ship was almost out of ammunition. &quot;São Paulo&quot; sailed into exile. The war continued; the São Paulo rebels were waging the Paraná Campaign, and a new revolt emerged in Rio Grande do Sul in October. The union between these two rebel groups gave rise to the Prestes Column, which marched throughout the countryside, prolonging the fight until the beginning of the following presidential term.

Smaller revolts continued to break out, and many conspiracies were discovered in advance. The Prestes Column, with its persistence, discredited the central government and the army, but avoided the most populated areas and only attacked one large city, Teresina. Apart from the urban middle class, the &quot;tenentist&quot; rebels were isolated. The political class, rural and urban oligarchies, and high military ranks sided with the government to defend order. Bernardes remained in absolute control. The only organized opposition was in Congress, where it did not reach a quarter of the deputies. Congressmen congratulated the president for the &quot;serene energy and imperturbable intrepidity&quot; with which he crushed the revolts.

=== State of emergency ===

Faced with instability, Bernardes preferred repression to conciliation. 1,287 of 1,460 days, 88.15% of his term, were spent with a state of emergency in force at some location in Brazil&#x27;s territory, more than all his predecessors combined. This measure suppressed individual guarantees and authorized coercive measures to stifle popular unrest and revolutionary acts. In his messages to Congress, Bernardes claimed that the measure was taken &quot;unwillingly, but in defense of high national interests&quot;, to &quot;prevent disorder, eliminating its causes&quot;, but the state of emergency would be nothing more than &quot;a situation that can almost be compared to the constitutional regime under which many more advanced and free peoples normally live&quot;.

In a letter to Bueno Brandão, before taking office, he confided: &quot;given the mental anarchy that we now observe, the tendency of the classes towards indiscipline and the social tendency to discredit authority, I considered it necessary to have a strong Police&quot;. Five days after taking office, he signed a decree reorganizing the police in the Federal District. The office of Chief of Police would no longer need to be held by a Law graduate and the Investigation and Political Security Inspectorate was transformed into the 4th Auxiliary Police Bureau, which had several sections with political police functions. Bernardes&#x27; personal archive contains reports from the 4th Bureau produced between March 1924 and November 1926, many of which are daily records of espionage of opponents and conspirators.

The two main figures of the repression were marshal Carneiro da Fontoura (&quot;Marechal Escuridão&quot;), chief of police, and major Carlos Reis, 4th Police Chief. Fontoura, considered a symbol of police discretion, would later lose his position due to his involvement with &quot;Jogo do Bicho&quot;. Under the marshal&#x27;s orders, an &quot;army of spies&quot; monitored the opposition in the capital. Unions were raided and closed. Newspapers critical of the government had copies seized and newsrooms raided. Arrests and torture of rebels, supporters, suspects and their relatives were repeated throughout the country.

With overcrowded jails, the government resorted to prison ships and islands in Guanabara Bay. Taking advantage of the legislation on the state of emergency, which allowed the &quot;exile to other places in the national territory&quot;, some received remote and isolated destinations: the island of Trindade, in the middle of the South Atlantic, and the penal colony of Clevelândia, on the border with French Guiana, where ill-treatment and tropical diseases killed around half of the deportees. Historian Carlo Romani even described the place as a concentration camp. The official report recorded 946 prisoners, of whom 491 died and 262 escaped. They were soldiers, civilians arrested for political reasons, including anarchists, petty criminals, small traders, minors and the unemployed.

=== Economy ===
The Bernardes government&#x27;s economic platform promised to balance public finances, stabilize the exchange rate and create an independent central bank. Equilibrium in the trade balance would come from the permanent defense of coffee, the increase in other exports, such as cotton, and import substitution, including by the installation of a steel mill in Minas Gerais. The government instituted income tax for the first time in Brazil and from the first year onwards made drastic cuts in civil service wages and public works, including cutting investments against the drought in the Northeast made by the previous administration.

The central bank would be the Bank of Brazil, which received gold reserves from the Treasury. The bank&#x27;s president, Cincinato Braga, and the Minister of Finance, Sampaio Vidal, were both from São Paulo, a perfect example of a &quot;milk coffee&quot; agreement. They used the bank&#x27;s issuing capacity to defend coffee prices, against the preferences of orthodox Minas Gerais politicians. The 1923 coffee crop was more than twice as big as the previous one, the currency continued to depreciate, and the government sought a loan from London bankers. These had the bargaining power to impose a mission of experts.

The mission&#x27;s recommendations were a scandal in the opposition press: privatizations, favors to foreign investors, dismissals of public servants and abandonment of the steel plant project and federal subsidies for the valorization of coffee. To guarantee the execution of the agreement, the British wanted the sale of public shares in the Bank of Brazil. On 2 March 1924, Bernardes was personally pressured by Edwin Samuel Montagu, head of the financial mission. He disagreed and, advised by the Minister of Finance, ended up agreeing. Before the proposal regarding the Bank of Brazil reached Congress, the British government restricted external loans, throwing away months of negotiations. Still, the Montagu Mission inspired many of the reforms of the remainder of the quadrennium.

Inflation continued to rise and spending on the military revolts exceeded the legal limit for the Bank of Brazil&#x27;s monetary issues. At the end of 1924, the orthodox advisors convinced Bernardes to carry out a deflationary and recessive adjustment, the only option in the absence of external credit. The Bank of Brazil carried out a drastic monetary contraction and the government further reduced the budget deficit. Cincinato Braga and Sampaio Vidal were dismissed and the responsibility for protecting coffee prices was transferred to São Paulo. This was a sudden reversal of the alliance with the agro-export sectors, wearing down the president with São Paulo. Bernardes defended himself: &quot;it would be absurd to attribute to me an attitude against coffee farming&quot;. What he was against was &quot;to artificially and dramatically increase the price of the product at the expense (...) of the Union&#x27;s finances, the national economy and public tranquility&quot;.

The orthodox adjustment contracted industrial production, which stagnated at the 1924 level, already low due to the fighting in São Paulo. Imports of capital goods fell and bankruptcies occurred above average levels. The goals were achieved: appreciation of the exchange rate and inflation control. This was not only due to the government, but also to the positive trends in international trade. The government&#x27;s fiscal and monetary discipline convinced New York bankers to grant a loan in 1926. The exchange rate of pence per mil-réis, which had fallen to 4.84 in November 1923, peaked at 7.75 in July 1926. The cost of living in Rio de Janeiro, as a percentage of the 1939 value, was 67 in 1922, rose to 114.6 until 1925 and fell to 93.9 in 1926. Brazil&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 3.7% in the quadrennium 1922–1926.

=== Legislation ===
Of the governments at the end of the First Brazilian Republic, that of Bernardes was simultaneously the one that most intervened in labor relations and most repressed the labor movement. Approaching some worker leaders, Bernardes enacted the Eloy Chaves Law, considered the origin of social security in Brazil, and several other labor laws, although modest and often circumvented by employers. In press legislation, Bernardes appreciated Senator Adolfo Gordo&#x27;s bill, enacted in October 1923, for protecting &quot;the dignity of journalism&quot; against &quot;the professionals of defamation&quot; and &quot;the exploiters of scandal&quot;. Among other provisions, the decree established prior restraint and the right of reply, and determined that the &quot;director or main editor will be considered the author of all writings&quot;.

In education, the &quot;Rocha Vaz Reform&quot;, enacted in January 1925, created the National Department of Education, considered by some authors as a precursor to the current Ministry of Education, although its attributions were limited, and included moral and civic education in the secondary education program. The government agreed with the Catholic Church that political, economic and social issues were, deep down, moral. On 4 May of the previous year, the president attended the golden jubilee of D. Arcoverde, archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, with his entire ministry, making public the rapprochement of the Church with the Brazilian State.

The first and only reform of the Constitution of 1891 was approved in September 1926. The changes to the constitution dealt, among other topics, with the presidential veto on bills, the preparation of budgets, the possibility of restricting international trade, deportation, passports and the exploitation of mineral deposits by foreigners, the appeals system of the federal judiciary, &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and cases of federal intervention. By the fifth paragraph of article 60, &quot;No judicial recourse is permitted, to Federal or local justice, against intervention in the States [and] the declaration of a state of emergency&quot;. The result was a strengthening of the Executive and central power.

The amendments were discussed in the midst of a state of emergency, military revolts and presidential succession. Bernardes reversed the idea that the crisis would justify not changing the republican political status. The initiative came from him, who hosted the review committee meetings at Catete. Historian Hélio Silva sought to refute accusations that the reform was promoted to oppress the opposition: it was only achieved at the end of Bernardes&#x27; term, its more specific conditions for federal intervention made it difficult for subsequent governments to apply the measure, and its narrower definition of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; was normal in other countries. The reform&#x27;s main changes persisted in the following constitutions.

=== Foreign policy ===
The biggest change in Brazilian foreign policy during the Bernardes administration was the withdrawal from the League of Nations, on 10 June 1926. This was the culmination and defeat of Brazil&#x27;s diplomatic efforts to obtain a permanent seat on the institution&#x27;s Deliberative Council, a claim that can be compared, in the 21st century, to Brazil&#x27;s ambition at a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Afrânio de Melo Franco represented Brazil in the League, in Geneva, where Brazilian representation was elevated, at great cost, to the status of embassy. The country&#x27;s image abroad, however, was harmed by internal repressive measures. In July 1924, the government war effort killed Italian citizens, destroyed British property, and censored American journalists.

To put pressure on the Council, Brazil threatened to veto Germany&#x27;s entry, and finally, it threatened to discredit the League with its withdrawal, which the country ended up having to do when it was not taken seriously. Bernardes overestimated Brazil&#x27;s importance, as Germany&#x27;s diplomatic normalization in the Locarno Treaties was a much greater concern for the European powers. Brazilian rhetoric criticized the &quot;Europeanization&quot; of the organization, claiming to represent the American continent, but diplomats from Latin American countries called for the veto to be lifted. Relations with these countries were out of step, visible in the disagreements regarding disarmament at the Fifth Pan-American Conference. With neighboring countries (Argentina and Uruguay), Brazil exchanged information regarding the conflict in Rio Grande do Sul.

The writings on the subject were based mainly on the president&#x27;s opponents, concluding that Brazil&#x27;s withdrawal from the League was a diplomatic fiasco, in which Bernardes, driven by considerations of internal public opinion, imposed his will against the recommendation of diplomats. More recent studies argue that the fiasco was also of the international system as a whole and the president was informed about geopolitics (through correspondence with rear admiral Augusto Carlos de Souza e Silva) and wanted to show that Brazil had its own opinion abroad.

== Presidential succession ==
The transition of power from Artur Bernardes to Washington Luís, on 15 November 1926, was peaceful, very different from what had occurred four years earlier. Catete, Minas Gerais and São Paulo were able to decide the successor with only rhetorical resistance. Possible enemies were demobilized by repression. The only problem came from Fernando de Melo Viana, the president of Minas Gerais. Viana even imagined himself as Bernardes&#x27; candidate for president, criticizing Washington Luís&#x27; candidacy and flirting with the opposition by suggesting an amnesty for the rebels. The solution was to nominate him as a candidate for vice president.

Melo Viana was the successor of Raul Soares, who died in 1924, in the government of Minas Gerais and leadership of the PRM. Bernardes, away from Minas Gerais and distracted by national political turmoil, was unable to control the succession in his home state. His &quot;era of personal power&quot; was not perpetuated in the PRM, which returned to the &quot;Tarasca&quot; collegiate system. Melo Viana chose as his successor a rival of Bernardes, deputy Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada, leader of the majority in the Chamber of Deputies. To the astonishment of his supporters, the president calmly accepted the appointment.

Washington Luís&#x27; inauguration took place under a state of emergency, as had been the case in 1922. Bernardes did not participate in the ceremony. The first acts of the new government eased political tensions: the government progressively ended the state of emergency, released political prisoners and suspended censorship. The Prestes Column went into exile. There was, however, no amnesty.

== Post-presidency ==

=== Senator (1927–1930) ===
Just two days after Luís&#x27; inauguration, a special edition of &quot;O Globo&quot; denounced the &quot;mud volcanoes&quot; of the past administration. The press went for revenge, unleashing satires and caricatures against the former president. The accusations were serious: the Clevelândia case finally came to light, shocking public opinion. The Conrado Niemeyer case, a businessman who died in the Central Police Building in 1925, had a lot of impact. The newspaper &quot;O Combate&quot;, from São Paulo, mentioned the &quot;new rich of Bernardism&quot;, the heads of the political police enriched through illegal means. &quot;O Globo&quot; accused the presidential group of having used censorship in favor of its private interests, such as the ban on reporting the fire at the Gávea fabric factory, of which Bernardes was one of the main shareholders.

Congress reduced the period of ineligibility for former presidents, from six to three months after their term of office, to allow Bernardes to run for senator in the February 1927 elections, filling the vacancy left by Antônio Carlos. Bernardes was elected with just under 175 thousand votes, without a competitor, but the results were challenged in the Powers Commission. He finally took office at the Monroe Palace on 25 May, protected by a huge police guard. The strongest security scheme was from Tijuca, where his brother Olegário lived, to the Monroe Palace, to mislead the crowd that intended to boo the delegation. Shortly before, Bernardes had declared to the Belo Horizonte press that the people of Rio were &quot;carnivalesque&quot; and lacking in civility. The former president appeared on the side of Botafogo and entered through the back door. In the Senate, he was covered in confetti and white dahlias, cheered by hundreds of supporters, and spoke in defense of his achievements.

The following morning he embarked under police escort for Europe, where he spent a period of vacation, living in Paris at the house of his friend Lineu de Paula Machado and visiting several countries. In May 1929 he began to participate in the work of the Senate. Only two of his speeches were highlighted: rebutting criticisms from Antônio Azeredo and debating with Irineu Machado. Against Azeredo, who recalled the detention of &quot;citizens of all classes, condemned by hatred and caprice&quot;, Bernardes read police records from the time of the state of emergency.

The succession of Antônio Carlos in the government of Minas Gerais divided the PRM: Bernardes, Melo Viana and Venceslau Brás launched themselves as pre-candidates in 1929. Bernardes ended up accepting Olegário Maciel, the conciliation candidate nominated by the state president. Melo Viana refused and campaigned against the Liberal Alliance, the coalition of which the PRM and its equivalents in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraíba were part of for the 1930 presidential election. The party structure set up by Bernardes experienced its first split. His opponent in the federal election was Júlio Prestes, from São Paulo, Washington Luís&#x27; candidate. It was not a personal issue; Prestes admired Bernardes.

=== Revolution of 1930 ===

With the Liberal Alliance defeated by Júlio Prestes in March–April, PRM leaders were convinced by Minas Gerais deputy Virgílio de Melo Franco and Rio Grande do Sul politician Batista Luzardo to join a future armed movement against the government, the Revolution of 1930. According to deputy Daniel Serapião de Carvalho, Bernardes was the most difficult Minas Gerais politician to win over to the revolutionary cause, but he remained faithful to it until the end. Bernardes was still the most prestigious member of his party and helped drag along undecided party members. 

Luís Aranha, brother of Oswaldo Aranha and Secretary of the Interior of Rio Grande do Sul, visited Bernardes in April to inform him of the plans. Aranha reported that the former president left a very strong impression and had no ideological reason to support the revolution, but considered it necessary and inevitable. Bernardes proposed organizing a council of former presidents after taking power. Historian Helena Bomeny believes that Bernardes participated in the revolution to restore the old Minas Gerais-São Paulo relationship, which Washington Luís had betrayed.

Bernardes took the risks of conspiring and was the only leader to participate in the revolution until the end. This made him a temporary ally of the former &quot;tenentist&quot; rebels. At the beginning of the armed movement, in October, Bernardes was in Belo Horizonte, having been alongside Olegário Maciel when he ordered the assault on the 12th Infantry Regiment and influenced him to accept the transfer of power from the Provisional Governing Junta to Getúlio Vargas. 

The new regime dissolved the National Congress, ending Bernardes&#x27; term as senator. The revolution momentarily enhanced his image. Upon returning to Viçosa, he was visited by the revolutionary commander João Alberto Lins de Barros, a veteran of the Prestes Column. In the Rio newspapers, the &quot;tenentists&quot; identified Bernardes with the oligarchic yoke and regionalism that the revolution should get rid of. The disillusionment was quick. The party for Minas Gerais politicians at the Jóquei Clube do Rio de Janeiro, on 29 December, was cold and without speeches.

=== PRM&#x27;s decline ===
The period after 1930 would see the rise of the next generation of Minas Gerais politicians, which Bernardes&#x27; followers could not prevent. In November 1930, Olegário Maciel dismissed three &quot;Bernardist&quot; state secretaries. At 80 years old, Maciel was influenced by the rising figures who needed to reduce Bernardes&#x27; power — the &quot;Mountain Bloc&quot; of Francisco Campos (federal Minister of Education), Gustavo Capanema and Amaro Lanari. Francisco Campos had been introduced to politics as a state and then federal deputy by Bernardes himself, who saw Campos as a traitor.

All of his mayoral nominations were ignored. President Vargas invited Bernardes to head the Brazilian embassy in Paris, who refused, realizing his enemies were lurking. In 1931, 80% of the PRM&#x27;s municipal directorates were incorporated into the October Legion, later Liberal Legion of Minas Gerais. It included Venceslau Brás, Olegário Maciel and Antônio Carlos, but not Bernardes. The Legion&#x27;s ideology was reminiscent of &quot;tenentist&quot; criticisms of Bernardism.

Olegário Maciel announced the absorption of the PRM by the new party, but Bernardes denied: &quot;this depends on its directors, who have not met for many years&quot;. Therefore, he called on party members to choose a new leadership. The party was reduced to a minority faction led by Bernardes, bringing together some figures such as Mário Brant, Djalma Pinheiro Chagas, Ovídio de Andrade, Daniel de Carvalho, Afrânio and Virgílio de Melo Franco. In Bernardes&#x27; opinion, &quot;the defections came to strengthen the party, purging it of the bad elements, of those who do not know how to be loyal&quot;. 

On 18 August 1931, Bernardes and other PRM members were detained at the party&#x27;s convention in Belo Horizonte. They were blamed for a &quot;mistake&quot;, as the federal government defined it: an attempted coup by the army organized by Oswaldo Aranha, Vargas&#x27; Minister of Justice, to install Virgílio de Melo Franco as governor in Olegário Maciel&#x27;s place. Vargas intended to overthrow Maciel through the PRM and later get rid of the PRM itself. Maciel remained in power thanks to the loyalty of the state&#x27;s Public Force. In February 1932, the party reached an agreement with the dominant faction, unifying Minas Gerais politics into the Social Nationalist Party (PSN). Dubbed the &quot;nameless party&quot;, the agreement did not last two months.

=== Constitutionalist Revolution ===

It is not surprising, therefore, that Bernardes took part in the plotting of the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, which began in São Paulo. Its goals were the ousting of Vargas, whose authority he considered illegal, and Olegário Maciel. On 8 August, Bernardes published a manifesto: &quot;As for me, I stay with São Paulo, because the civic soul of Brazil has been transported there today&quot;. In this he had to make an effort to improve his image with São Paulo politicians. Constitutionalist Leven Vampré used the bombing of São Paulo as an example of the federal government&#x27;s disregard for the state in the past, even without glorifying the rebellion itself.

Bernardes tried to revolt the Public Force of Minas Gerais, without success. Mayors and farmers in the Viçosa region accepted his leadership in a war effort, in which they recruited volunteers and purchased weapons, uniforms and food. Government troops suppressed this militia and Bernardes went on hiding, spending a night on each farm. Investigators arrested him in a hut in the woods, with torn clothes and a revolver on his waist. He did not resist arrest, but asked to spend another three days in Viçosa and continue to Belo Horizonte without an escort. He was informed that he was not a &quot;higher authority&quot; and was sent on a train to Rio de Janeiro.

Imprisoned in the capital, Bernardes, together with his sons and other relatives, passed through the islands of Cobras and Rijo, and on the latter he gave a statement assuming full responsibility for his revolt. On 1 November he was transferred to Fort Vigia. Like other leaders of the revolution, he had his political rights revoked for three years and was sent into exile on 3 December. The following day, he took a boat to the Maritime Police pier to board the ship &quot;Asturias&quot;. A crowd faced the police to cheer his departure, which Hélio Silva cited as proof of his accumulated prestige. However, the boarding of his family members, at other piers, was violent: his wife and daughters were attacked by supporters of the &quot;tenentists&quot; and Artur Bernardes Filho was injured by a bullet. With Bernardes in Lisbon and other leaders removed, the PRM was left with no leadership.

=== Constituent Assembly and Estado Novo ===
Getúlio Vargas convened a National Constituent Assembly in 1933 and decreed a general amnesty on 28 May of the following year, making Bernardes eligible. Vargas was indirectly re-elected by Congress in an election in which Bernardes received one of the 71 opposition votes. The positive demonstrations upon his arrival in Belo Horizonte, on 21 August, were even reported by &quot;Estado de Minas&quot;, the official newspaper of the Progressive Party (PP), led by federal intervener Benedito Valadares, to which the PRM was in opposition. The party elected 14 of 48 state deputies and 11 federal deputies, with the rest belonging to the PP. Bernardes, honorary president of the PRM and elected on both lists, opted for the Chamber of Deputies, which began its works on 3 May 1935. Bernardes planned with other regional oppositionists (Borges de Medeiros, Cincinato Braga, Sampaio Correia and Otávio Mangabeira) a national party.

As a deputy, Bernardes opposed the National Security Law, was one of the few oppositionists to fully support the declaration of a state of emergency after the Communist Uprising and was radically opposed to the Itabira Iron Ore Company, whose case was still controversial, proposing that the government declare the contract expired, as it was harmful to Brazil&#x27;s interests. In Minas Gerais politics, the intervener Valadares was accused of police violence against PRM candidates in the 1936 municipal elections. Bernardes met Valadares twice in Rio, but did not want conciliation. Flores da Cunha, the federal intervener of Rio Grande do Sul, advised him that the agreement would only be a maneuver against the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Antônio Carlos. At the end of the year, ten of the fourteen PRM state deputies joined an agreement with Valadares and were therefore accused of &quot;deserters&quot; and &quot;defectors&quot; by Bernardes.

For the 1938 presidential election, Bernardes chaired the executive committee of the Brazilian Democratic Union, created on 10 June to launch the opposition candidate Armando de Sales Oliveira. Such negotiations were interrupted by the 1937 coup d&#x27;état, which installed Vargas&#x27; as dictator with the Estado Novo and closed the National Congress. Bernardes, without a term, was threatened with exile (which was imposed on Artur Bernardes Filho in 1938) and restricted in his movement: first to just Rio de Janeiro and Viçosa and, finally, at the beginning of 1939, only his farm in Viçosa. In August, after informing the Federal District police chief, Filinto Müller, that he was going to Rio de Janeiro to take care of his health, he was no longer confined. Bernardes stayed away from politics, apart from private conversations and discreet negotiations, but signed the &quot;Manifesto dos Mineiros&quot; in 1943, a declaration in favor of redemocratization in Brazil. After reading the manifesto&#x27;s final version, which mentioned &quot;the oppression of states of emergency of dubious legitimacy and long duration&quot;, Bernardes tried to withdraw his signature.

=== Fourth Brazilian Republic ===
After the ousting of Getúio Vargas in 1945, Bernardes participated in the provisional committee of the National Democratic Union (UDN), formed by opponents of the regime, but left to found his own party, the Republican Party (PR), which he presided over until his death in 1955. The PR &quot;was confused (...) with the figure of its creator&quot;, much more Bernardist than the PRM had been. With little national projection, the party was the third political force in Minas Gerais, where it lived in coalitions with the two largest parties, the UDN and the Social Democratic Party (PSD). At the national level, the PR supported Eduardo Gomes, from the UDN, in the 1945 presidential election. Ironically, Eduardo Gomes was one of the former &quot;tenentist&quot; leaders. In the 1950 presidential election, the PR supported Cristiano Machado, from the PSD.

In the elections for the new Constituent Assembly, Bernardes was elected with 8,548 votes, the least voted of the six PR deputies from Minas Gerais. As a federal deputy, after 1946, he was elected president of the National Security Commission. With just over nine thousand votes in the 1950 election, he was only the party&#x27;s third substitute, taking over the incumbents&#x27; seats several times in the 1951–1955 legislature. Interestingly, he never returned to the Senate, the traditional destination of former presidents and governors. When asked by journalist Paulino de Oliveira, Bernardes replied that he could not afford the election expenses. But Artur Bernardes Filho was a senator for Minas Gerais.

Throughout this final period of his political career, in the 40s and 50s, Bernardes participated in the campaign for Brazil&#x27;s monopoly on oil, which would result in the founding of Petrobras. In April 1948, he became one of the honorary presidents of the Center for Studies and Defense of Petroleum and the National Economy (CEDPEN). The campaign was persecuted by president Eurico Gaspar Dutra and included military personnel, students, public figures, intellectuals and communists. Also in 1948, Bernardes opposed the creation of the International Institute of the Amazon Hyleia, which according to him, would result in the internationalization of the Amazon. In the 1954 elections, almost at the age of 80, Bernardes was the second most voted of the five federal deputies from the PR, with 21,761 votes.

== Death ==
Bernardes died at 13:45 of a myocardial infarction, in the company of his family and the Capuchin friar Cassiano de Vila Rosa, on 23 March 1955, less than two months after the start of work as federal deputy. The procession was accompanied by distinguished politicians and planes from the Brazilian Air Force. In a wreath of flowers left beside his coffin, an uncomfortable and possibly ironic memory was written: &quot;the survivors of Clevelândia ask for forgiveness for having risen up against such an honest government and such a worthy president&quot;. Bernardes lay in state at the Chamber of Deputies and was later buried in the São João Batista Cemetery. It was the end of a 51-year long political career. The cult to Bernardes&#x27; image still gave the PR survival until the extinction of the old political parties by Institutional Act No. 2, already during the military dictatorship in Brazil, in 1965.

== Ideology and image ==

=== Personality ===
Personally, Bernardes has been described as a disciplined, diligent, intelligent and well-informed man, punctual, &quot;well spoken, cultured and with polite gestures&quot;. Of a &quot;private life above suspicion&quot;, &quot;austere habits, a stern appearance, always serious&quot;, he &quot;rarely smiled&quot;. &quot;No one has ever seen him have an outburst of anger&quot;. Apparently shy, Bernardes expressed himself well, although he preferred to listen rather than speak in front of ministers. In public, he always wore &quot;impeccably tailored pants&quot;. He wrote correctly, with &quot;sobriety&quot; and &quot;elegance&quot;. Nair de Teffé, wife of Hermes da Fonseca, described him as a &quot;dry, austere, formal man&quot;, &quot;affable in a mild manner&quot;. Afonso Arinos described him as &quot;invariably courteous, extremely reserved, always well dressed and used to remain motionless at his bench, so intent on reading the daily appointments that it seemed like he was learning them by heart&quot;.

When president, Bernardes did not appear in public and only showed himself in closed spaces or to previously selected audiences, which can be explained by the angry mobs that welcomed him at the beginning of the campaign in Rio de Janeiro. &quot;O Globo&quot; praised Washington Luís for opening Catete to popular audiences, &quot;reestablishing practices that the misanthropic tendency of his predecessor had abolished&quot;. Even in his private office, in the morning, Bernardes wore a double-breasted jacket. In the afternoons, he could be seen praying on Catete&#x27;s terrace, although, according to him, in 1925 he was no longer a practicing Catholic and only later resumed the religion.

Still according to Afonso Arinos, Bernardes had &quot;broad personal ambition&quot;, bringing &quot;probably well-established in his spirit the certainty of his own ascension&quot;. He placed a lot of trust in himself due to &quot;an almost religious faith in the republican mission that had been assigned to him by God or destiny&quot;. Conversely, &quot;he distrusted his adversaries for moral reasons, always attributing to them cavilous intentions. He also distrusted his friends, but because he believed them to be naive, inexperienced, unaware of universal malice&quot;. Bernardes already said that &quot;it is essential to have a lot of malice towards politicians in this environment and to always distrust them, no matter how much they deserve it from us&quot;. In the view of Pandiá Calógeras, one of Epitácio Pessoa&#x27;s ministers, Bernardes &quot;considered any dissent from his own opinions as proof of personal enmity&quot;.

According to historian Norma de Goés Monteiro, Bernardes &quot;was not a man to forgive. He &quot;had a reputation as a hardened political fighter: he remembered his friends and never forgot his enemies&quot;, according to Eul-Soo Pang. He always dealt with his enemies with iron and fire&quot;. His predominant characterization in historiography is that of a revanchist and vengeful ruler, with an opinionated and willful character. According to Afonso Arinos, Bernardes carried out the &quot;methodical destruction of all his enemies and former adversaries&quot;, less &quot;out of feelings of revenge or in the interest of his security, than out of a spirit of public morality and the duty to maintain order in the country&quot;. Afrânio de Carvalho, a biographer of Raul Soares, assessed that Bernardes behaved like &quot;a resentful person who, having defeated his opponents, did not defeat himself&quot;.

The president &quot;filled the four-year period 1922–1926 with his harsh and indomitable individuality&quot;, in Assis Chateaubriand&#x27;s terms. According to Pedro Calmon, psychologists saw him as a &quot;strong man&quot;, &quot;inflexible in his directives&quot;. According to Gilberto Amado&#x27;s testimony, &quot;Bernardes liked power to actually exercise it&quot; and &quot;he commanded, he was never ordered&quot;. &quot;The hypothesis of Bernardes abandoning power could not be conceived&quot;. According to other descriptions, he was &quot;harsh, hard and uncompromising&quot;, but also &quot;honorable and incorruptible&quot;; &quot;honest and with high public spirit&quot;, but &quot;too rigid and reserved&quot;. &quot;[A] man of action&quot;, &quot;[he] would go to the end&quot;. &quot;He did not know how to be generous, or even tolerant towards his adversaries&quot;, but all out of a sincere &quot;conviction of fulfilling a higher mission&quot;, according to Calógeras.

=== Reputation ===
Bernardes was one of the most controversial rulers of his period. Charismatic, but not popular, he was idolized by his friends and hated by his enemies. He is remembered for having ruled through violent authoritarianism, but also a &quot;modernizing authoritarianism&quot;. His opponents coined nicknames such as &quot;Viçosa&#x27;s reprobate&quot;, &quot;&quot;Seu Mé&quot;, &quot;rolinha&quot;, &quot;Calamitoso&quot;&quot; and &quot;[state of] emergency president&quot;. The Estado Novo, by disqualifying the &quot;Old Republic&quot;, of which Bernardes was a representative, cemented the negative memory around him. In historiography he is seen as xenophobic and intransigent. More favorable writers prefer to justify Bernardes&#x27; repressive measures as a reaction to the opposition&#x27;s attitudes. Favorable biographies describe him as statesman and &quot;State builder&quot;, who implemented policies of public interest, without ever tolerating administrative immorality.

Pandiá Calógeras saw a tragedy in Bernardes&#x27; presidency: &quot;the president sincerely yearned to present himself in the eyes of the nation as an angel defending the purity of republican doctrine and the principle of authority&quot;. But what the &quot;governed mass&quot; could see was &quot;a kind of low police dictatorship, in the hands of unaccountable subordinates, of the lowest class and the least respectable&quot;. Calógeras exempted Bernardes from blame for &quot;his most censored decisions&quot;: he was &quot;the victim of exploiters of his known weaknesses&quot;.

The flagrant failure to fulfill one of his campaign promises was highly criticized: &quot;the president will forget the insults done to the candidate&quot;. Hélio Silva remarked that the opposition press disregarded this promise, and Bruno de Almeida Magalhães argued that the opposition canceled the promise at the time it threatened governability. For Francisco Moacir de Assunção Filho, Bernardes&#x27; role &quot;was not exactly that of a statesman&quot;, but &quot;possibly no other president of the so-called Old Republic faced so many adversities during his term in office&quot;. Years later, a self-criticism by Bernardes, when he was a federal deputy, was published in &quot;Ultima Hora&quot; on 17 November 1967: &quot;as president of the Republic, I was just a police chief. And as a police chief faced with revolutionary pressure, I only knew how to do one thing: to arrest, persecute, contain by terror&quot;.

Another aspect of his reputation was the &quot;fight to defend natural resources&quot; against foreign capital, in the cases of iron, oil and the Amazon Hyleia. As a protectionist and opponent of the Itabira Iron Ore Company, he was accused of being an enemy of the steel industry. His economic nationalism was not always recognized by his contemporaries. Due to the proposals of the Montagu Mission, Bernardes was accused of being a puppet of foreign interests in 1924.

=== São Paulo and Clevelândia ===
The authorized biography &quot;Arthur Bernardes: Estadista da República&quot;, by Bruno de Almeida Magalhães, barely covers the bombing, repression and other sensitive topics to the former president&#x27;s image. The chapter referring to the state of emergency, Clevelândia and the constitutional reform is entitled &quot;Bastion of legality&quot;. Magalhães remarked the exceptional measures taken in previous governments, arguing that Floriano Peixoto, with his firing squads and deportations to the Amazon, did much worse. In the same chapter, he compared Bernardes to Peixoto, praising both for saving the Republic by crushing revolutionary waves. The &quot;iron will&quot; of Pessoa and Bernardes supposedly spared the nation from a fratricidal struggle.

In São Paulo, the president is partly remembered as the destroyer of the city. The use of artillery, as it harmed civilians more than the rebel positions, was branded as a &quot;terrifying bombing&quot;. Jurists discussed the decision to bomb São Paulo as a possible war crime for which Bernardes would be the highest responsible authority. Bernardes avoided the subject in public. In private, he would have argued that the bombing was to prevent an American occupation of the Amazon, under the pretext of the weakness of the Brazilian government. This explanation fits with his nationalist rhetoric, but it is not very credible considering the non-interventionism of the then president of the United States, Calvin Coolidge.

The armed revolt of 1924 ended up falling into official oblivion in São Paulo. Clevelândia also fell into oblivion for many years, although it sometimes appeared in the press under &quot;the central thesis of an open-air extermination camp&quot;. Magalhães ignored the case: &quot;some prisoners perished&quot;, but &quot;the legend about Clevelândia&quot; has already been &quot;inquestionably refuted&quot;. The specialized bibliography proves a high mortality rate in the area.

=== Bernardism ===
The political current aligned with Bernardes&#x27; leadership, his style and his time in power are called &quot;Bernardism&quot;, whose symbol was a red carnation worn in the lapel. As an admirer of Floriano Peixoto, Bernardes was even cited as a Jacobin, an ideological label that could mean radicalism, nationalism and/or authoritarianism in this historical period. Bernardes&#x27; actions in the Minas Gerais and federal governments demonstrate his sympathy for the general lines of the Brazilian Jacobin program: the protection of industry, nationalization of soil, exclusion of foreigners from politics, aid to small properties and tariff reforms. However, he differed greatly in proposing collaboration between Church and State. Political scientist Christian Lynch classified Bernardes as a conservative republican along the lines of Pinheiro Machado, Quintino Bocaiúva, Campos Sales and other eminent politicians of the period.

Bernardes, Raul Soares and Nelson Coelho de Sena were exponents of what Fabíula Sevilha de Souza defined as a Minas Gerais-style developmentalist project initiated during the administration of João Pinheiro (1906–1908). Pinheiro defended protectionism at an early stage in the industry, to boost private initiative, which would start with the raw materials available in the territory and evolve into more complex industries. Education, including popular and technical-agricultural education, would train a disciplined and moral workforce, with a love for work and property, alleviating the social instability of modernization. ESAV can be considered an heir to João Pinheiro&#x27;s model farms.

Pinheiro and the Bernardes-Soares-Sena trio diverge in liberalism, from which the latter moved away, in a more national-authoritarian intellectual environment. In the figure of Bernardes &quot;the cult, respect, [and] the personalization of authority, completed each other, expanding with authoritarianism, under whose sign the world began to live&quot;. Authoritarianism would be the response to the degeneration and deviation from Order and Progress demonstrated by social upheavals. Brazilian laws, said Bernardes, were drawn up under an &quot;enthusiastic and generous idealism, by men who had no experience or practical knowledge of the new form of government&quot;, which would have transformed the Brazilian Republic into a &quot;system of exceptional freedoms&quot;, &quot;excessively progressive and little suited to our country, our nature, our social and political culture&quot;. The 1891 Constitution &quot;disarmed the government to conveniently defend order&quot;. Bernardes even agreed with the &quot;tenentists&quot; that elections in the Old Republic were a &quot;scam&quot; and the government was full of corrupt people.

Christian Lynch saw in him and in Washington Luís an autocratic presidency, different from his predecessors, who were arbiters or sentinels of the system. Hélio Silva defended Bernardes against the accusation of being a dictator, but acknowledged that he was an authoritarian president. For Afonso Arinos, &quot;if Bernardes&#x27; government in Minas Gerais was, as they say, dictatorial, there is no doubt that it was a kind of &#x27;enlightened dictatorship&#x27;&quot;.

Bernardes&#x27; ambition for development was elitist and would keep the agrarian elites, now associated with the industrial elites, in power. A conservative modernization would place the lower classes under state guardianship. When declaring a national holiday on 1 May, Worker&#x27;s Day, Bernardes clarified that the date was not intended for &quot;subversive projects&quot;, but for the &quot;glorification of orderly and useful labor&quot;.

The Executive would be strong, and the State would be voluntarist and dirigist; in his words to the press, when he founded PR, &quot;the State cannot be a simple spectator&quot;, &quot;it must intervene to police, regulate, maintain balance, repress abuses and injustices, as the supreme organ of security and social harmony&quot;. On the other hand, in the Constituent Assembly he criticized state interventionism and proposed the extinction of the government entities created during the governments of Getúlio Vargas.

The system&#x27;s political strength, Bernardes recognized, began in the municipalities. As a municipalist, he defended municipal autonomy and administrative decentralization, although he also sought greater external control over municipal budgets. In his platform as a candidate for state president, he defended state support for factions that better took care of the &quot;impartial and severe collection of taxes&quot; and &quot;honest and scrupulous application of public money&quot;, demanding from them &quot;a stamp of greater nobility and elevation in local politics&quot;.

His messages to the National Congress argued in favor of compulsory and secret voting, the development of railways and colonization of marginal lands, reformulation of income tax, restriction of firearms to the military and police personnel, tightening of the naturalization criteria for foreigners and applicability of the death penalty during internal revolts. Bernardes also proposed the transfer of Brazil&#x27;s capital away from the &quot;tumult of a great cosmopolitan city&quot;, combining the promise of development in the countryside with the fear of the masses of Rio de Janeiro. In the 1946 Constituent Assembly, he was against the election of the mayor of the Federal District and defended a six-year term for the President of Brazil.

== Legacy ==
According to historian Carlo Romani, the legacy of the Bernardes government was &quot;the beginning of preventative and systematic social control, on the part of the federal government&quot;, whose &quot;repressive apparatus and, more than that, the mentality in the lower echelons of the bureaucracy of surveillance and control over life remained latent&quot; in the dictatorships of 1937–1945 and 1964–1985. The example of the 4th Auxiliary Police Bureau, which arrested Bernardes himself in 1932, was soon followed by the creation of DOPS (Department of Political and Social Order) in the states. Repression during the state of emergency coincides with the beginning of decline of the anarchists and the rise of the Communist Party in the Brazilian labor movement. Both were repressed, but the communists less so, becoming predominant in Rio de Janeiro.

In Viçosa, the ESAV did not prevent the coffee growing crisis in Zona da Mata, but became a national reference nevertheless, cultivating an agricultural intellectual elite in public administration, the private sector and academia. The biographical summary of Bernardes published by the Federal University of Viçosa has a positive tone, and the Artur Bernardes House, located in Silviano Brandão Square, in Viçosa, was listed in 1995 by the State Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage (Iepha) of Minas Gerais. Built during his presidential term, the house was visited sporadically by him and today contains a memorial.

The Bernardes administration&#x27;s labor legislation pointed to official unionism, a model later implemented in the Vargas Era. &quot;Companhia Vale do Rio Doce S.A.&quot;, founded in 1942 to manage, among others, the Itabira mines, followed a model similar to that proposed by Bernardes. However, the first large state-owned steel company in Brazil, &quot;Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional&quot;, was installed in Rio de Janeiro and not in Minas Gerais.

Bernardes lends his name to a municipality in Minas Gerais, formerly Calambau, and another in São Paulo, formerly Guarucaia. He also lends his name to an oil refinery in Cubatão.

<text>George Herman Mahon (September 22, 1900 – November 19, 1985) was an American politician and attorney. A Democrat, he served 22 consecutive terms as a member the United States House of Representatives from Texas.

==Biography==
Born near Haynesville, Louisiana, Mahon&#x27;s family moved to Texas when he was a child. He graduated from Hardin–Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, in 1924, and from the University of Texas School of Law in Austin in 1925. Mahon was elected county attorney for Mitchell County, Texas, in 1926, and he served as district attorney of the 32nd judicial district of Texas from 1927 to 1933.

Mahon was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1934. He was a delegate to each Democratic National Convention from 1936 to 1964.

Mahon voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, which were directed at enforcing constitutional rights for African Americans and other minorities. He also opposed ratification of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which gave the federal government oversight and enforcement over state practices that discriminated against minority voters.

He was the chairman of the Appropriations committee from 1964 until his retirement from the House in 1979, as well as the Dean of the House for his last three years. Mahon was also appointed on the panel for the Manhattan Project.

After his years in the House, Mahon stayed in Washington to work with the Smithsonian Institution, for which he had served as a regent from 1964 to 1978.

Mahon died on November 19, 1985, in San Angelo, Texas, due to complications from surgery. He is interred in the Loraine City Cemetery in Loraine, Texas.

<text>Caleb Bingham (1757–1817) was an educator and textbook author of late 18th-century New England, whose works were also influential into the 19th and 20th. Among his most influential works were books on oratory, or public speaking. A native of Salisbury, Connecticut, he spent much of his career in Boston, Massachusetts as a publisher and bookseller. Bingham was educated at Dartmouth College and valedictorian of his class of 1782. He also taught at the college.

One of his most popular works was &quot;The Columbian Orator&quot;, originally published in 1797, an anthology which contained rules on oratory, but consisted primarily of texts for reading and recitation. The selections (from about three dozen writers) include poems, essays, short dialogues, and extracts from famous speeches. The content reflects a substantial concern with the moral education of youth and the preparation of citizens in the young Republic. (Selections include arguments made in Parliament in support of the American Colonies.) The book has continued in print into the late 20th century.

&quot;The Columbian Orator&quot; served as an inspiration to many orators, including the African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who purchased a copy as a young man and used it to develop his powerful public speaking style.

Two other well-known textbooks of Bingham&#x27;s, also on reading, grammar, and oratory, were &quot;The American Preceptor&quot; (1794) and &quot;The Young Lady&#x27;s Accidence&quot; (1785). &quot;The American Preceptor&quot; is similar to &quot;The Columbian Orator&quot; in its content. Selections (often about two pages in length) draw attention to the evils of slavery, the importance of clemency toward the unfortunate (including one&#x27;s captive enemies), personal virtue and industry, religious tolerance, and the education of girls. Some stories recite the acts of a virtuous American Indian, African, Moor, Catholic, or other person—sometimes in contrast to a less virtuous white or Christian character. Bingham also takes aim at characters who care more about fashion, entertainments, or lapdogs than about honest labor, solid education, and duties within the household. The publication of &quot;The Young Lady&#x27;s Accidence&quot; was part of his advocacy for opening education to girls. The success of Bingham&#x27;s books can be attributed in part to the dramatic and narrative interest of many selections.

Additional biographical and historical material appears in David W. Blight (ed. and new intro.), Caleb Bingham, &quot;The Columbian Orator: Containing a Variety of Original and Selected Pieces together with Rules, Which are Calculated to Improve Youth and Others, in the Ornamental and Useful Art of Eloquence&quot; (Bicentennial Edition, New York: New York University Press, 1998). For a biographical essay by someone who knew Bingham, see William S. Fowle, “Memoir of Caleb Bingham, with Notices of the Public Schools of Boston, prior to 1800.” Fowle&#x27;s essay is also rich in detail concerning educational materials and practices during Bingham&#x27;s lifetime.

<doc id="946040" wikidata="Q311225" url="?curid=946040" title="Washington Luís">
<text>Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa (; 26 October 1869 – 4 August 1957) was a Brazilian politician who served as the 13th president of Brazil. Elected governor of São Paulo state in 1920 and president of Brazil in 1926, Washington Luís belonged to the Republican Party of São Paulo (PRP) and served as the last president of the First Brazilian Republic.

Facing the crisis generated by the Great Depression in the United States, the president lost almost all his support. He selected his friend Júlio Prestes as his successor in 1930, but just three weeks before the end of his term, Luís was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état during the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 and was succeeded as president by the short-lived Brazilian Military Junta in the last few months of 1930.

== Early life ==

He was born in Macaé, Rio de Janeiro, to a family of Portuguese Romani descent, and moved to São Paulo, where he was educated and graduated from the University of São Paulo Law School in 1891. He was appointed prosecutor in Barra Mansa, Rio de Janeiro in 1892, but resigned to devote himself to law in Batatais, São Paulo, where he began his political career. Luís was an alderman in Batatais with Federal Republican Party (&quot;Partido Republicano Federal&quot;; PRF) and became President of the Municipal Chamber in 1897. Luís was mayor of Batatais from 1898 to 1899. He was elected congressman from the Farmer&#x27;s Party (&quot;Partido da Lavoura&quot;) in 1900. Luís was a state representative for the Republican Party of São Paulo (&quot;Partido Republicano Paulista&quot;; PRP) between 1904 and 1906, participating in the Constituent Assembly of São Paulo, which revised the Constitution of the State in 1905. He resigned as representative to take the office of Secretary of State of Justice and Public Safety from 1906 to 1912.

He was the leader of the situationists and again became a state representative for the Republican Party of São Paulo from 1912 to 1913. He interrupted his mandate to become mayor of São Paulo (1914–1919), when he faced the general strike of 1917. He was governor of the state of São Paulo from 1920 to 1924. In 1924, Luís led the 3rd Battalion organized in Batatais to fight the rebels of São Paulo, which in 1925 became the Miguel Costa-Prestes Column. From 1925 to 1926, Luís served as a senator for the PRP.

== Presidency ==

Through direct election, Luís went on to hold the Presidency of the Republic on 15 November 1926. He was deposed by the Revolution of 1930 on 24 October and went into exile in Europe and the United States, returning to Brazil after seventeen years in 1947. After returning from exile, he moved to São Paulo and devoted himself to historical studies. He was a worthy member of the philanthropic hospital Santa Casa de São Paulo; honorary president of the Brazilian Red Cross; member of the Institutes of History and Geography of São Paulo, Bahia and Ceará; member of the &quot;Academia Paulista de Letras&quot;; and member of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. The Rodovia Washington Luís in the state of São Paulo is named in his honor.

Throughout the 1920s, the Old Republic suffered a deep wear due to demonstrations of opposition from the urban middle class, the lieutenants&#x27; and workers&#x27; movements and dissident oligarchies. Early in his administration, came to an end the Prestes Column, with 620 men who went into Bolivian territory and subsequently dissolved. The government of Washington Luís was no longer threatened by the lieutenants&#x27; rebellions and for the advancement of the labor movement, however, to restrain new opposition movements he created Celerada Act in 1927, which imposed press censorship and restricted the right of assembly, leading to underground the Brazilian Communist Party, which had been recognized by the government earlier that year.

The global economic crisis of 1929, triggered with the stock market crash on 24 October, was the largest in the history of capitalism, reaching many countries and paralyzing economic activities. Its effects in Brazil overthrew the valuation policy of coffee, started in 1906 with the signing of the Taubaté Agreement. Coffee, which accounted for 70% of Brazilian exports, had its price reduced in the international market. The crisis threatened the stability of the government of Washington Luís, who did not allow the new currency devaluation, pleaded by farmers before the disaster on the New York Stock Exchange.

== Overthrow ==
Under the system of coffee with milk politics that prevailed for most of the Old Republic, a man from Minas Gerais should have succeeded Washington Luís as president. However, Washington Luís supported another &quot;paulista&quot;, his friend Júlio Prestes, for president in 1930.
Prestes&#x27; victory in the presidential elections of 1 March 1930 was questioned on suspicion of fraud. The assassination of João Pessoa, governor of Paraíba and candidate for vice president on the plate of Getúlio Vargas on 26 July 1930, was a decisive factor for the worsening of movements opposed to the government of Washington Luís, already strained by the coffee crisis. The assassination, later proved, did not have any political purposes. Reassuming the government of Rio Grande do Sul, Vargas and other politician such as Osvaldo Aranha began the political conspiracy that led to the movement of 3 October 1930, the Revolution of 1930, as became known the episode. President Washington Luís was deposed on 24 October by the heads of the armed forces, and a provisional government junta took power, composed of generals Tasso Fragoso and Mena Barreto and by admiral Isaías de Noronha.
== Death ==
Luís died in São Paulo on 4 August 1957.

<text>Edward Smith Fatu (March 28, 1973 – December 4, 2009) was an American professional wrestler, best known for his time with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the ring name Umaga. Fatu was also known for his time with All Japan Pro Wrestling in the mid-2000s, where he was a main eventer under the ring name Jamal.

He was a member of the Anoaʻi family, a renowned Samoan wrestling family. During his first stint with WWE billed as Jamal, he was part of tag team 3-Minute Warning, with his cousin Matt Anoaʻi, billed as Rosey. He was released from the company in June 2003, later going to All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and becoming a mainstay for the company from late 2003 to 2005. In April 2006, Fatu returned to WWE under the ring name Umaga. Fatu went undefeated on the Raw brand throughout the year before finally suffering his first defeat in January 2007 at the hands of then WWE Champion John Cena. The following month, he won the WWE Intercontinental Championship for the first time, and won it for the second time in July 2007. He also appeared in the &quot;Battle of the Billionaires&quot; WrestleMania 23 match as Mr. McMahon&#x27;s representative. He was released by WWE in June 2009 and wrestled on the independent circuit until his death in December of that year.

==Early life==
Edward Smith Fatu was born in American Samoa on March 28, 1973, to Vera and Solofa Fatu. He was a member of the Anoaʻi family. His mother was the sister of Afa and Sika of The Wild Samoans. He has two older brothers who are also professional wrestlers: Sam (The Tonga Kid) and Solofa Jr. (Rikishi). He was also the uncle of Jacob Fatu, Jonathan (Jimmy Uso) and Joshua Fatu (Jey Uso), and Joseph Fatu (Solo Sikoa), as well as a cousin of several professional wrestlers, including Rodney Anoaʻi (Yokozuna), Matt Anoaʻi (Rosey) and Joe Anoaʻi (Roman Reigns). Fatu grew up in Samoa and played football in high school.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1995–2001)===
Fatu trained with his cousin Matt Anoaʻi at the Wild Samoan professional wrestling school operated by members of their family. In 1995, with his training complete, Fatu debuted in his uncle Afa&#x27;s World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. From 1999 to 2000, he worked for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in Japan.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2003)===

In 2001, Fatu, along with his cousin Matt, signed developmental contracts with World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and were assigned to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA), adopting the tag team name the Island Boyz, and with Fatu using the ring name Ekmo. They won the HWA Tag Team Championship in November 2001 by defeating Evan Karagias and Shannon Moore. They also competed for Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW), holding the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions.

Fatu (renamed to Jamal) and Anoaʻi (renamed to Rosey) made their main roster debut on the July 22, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as 3-Minute Warning, a pair of villainous thugs. They were hired as enforcers of Eric Bischoff, attacking random wrestlers each week, after Bischoff either gave people three minutes to entertain him before they were attacked or decided that three minutes of a segment was enough before the team appeared to end it. They attacked numerous wrestlers at the orders of Bischoff, including D&#x27;Lo Brown and Shawn Stasiak. They also attacked non-wrestlers, including ring announcer Lilian Garcia and former wrestlers Jimmy Snuka, Mae Young and The Fabulous Moolah. Their most notable event came when they attacked two lesbians on the September 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

3-Minute Warning then began a feud with Billy and Chuck, interfering in their storyline commitment ceremony, and defeating them on September 22 at the Unforgiven pay-per-view event. Rico, Billy and Chuck&#x27;s former manager, also began to manage 3-Minute Warning during this time. On November 17 at Survivor Series, they competed in an elimination tables match, which was won by The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). The team lasted just shy of a year, with Fatu being released from his WWE contract in June 2003, reportedly after his involvement in a bar fight.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2004)===
On September 10, 2003, Fatu debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under the ring name of Ekmo Fatu, helping Sonny Siaki defeat D&#x27;Lo Brown in a casket match. He then formed a tag team with Siaki. From October to August 2004, he teamed with Sonny Siaki to defeat the teams of Shark Boy and Mad Mikey, Danny Doring and Roadkill, and America&#x27;s Most Wanted. Fatu made his final appearance on August 11, 2004, where he lost to Alex Shelley.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2003–2005)===

Fatu debuted in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in November 2003 under his former ring name Jamal, immediately aligning himself with Taka Michinoku&#x27;s Roughly Obsess and Destroy (R.O.D.) stable. He most often teamed with fellow members Taiyō Kea and Buchanan, though he began to receive a push as a singles wrestler in early 2004. Entering that year&#x27;s Champion Carnival, he failed to advance past the group stages, though earned a major upset win over Keiji Mutō. In May, he began a feud with Toshiaki Kawada, setting his sights on Kawada&#x27;s Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. The two fought for the belt on June 12 in Nagoya, Aichi, where Kawada was victorious. After this loss, Jamal spent the rest of 2004 primarily focused on the tag division, and on December 1, 2004, he and frequent partner Taiyō Kea won the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League tournament, beating Kaz Hayashi and Satoshi Kojima in the final.

The following month on January 16, 2005, they won the World Tag Team Championship for the first time, beating New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) representatives Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yutaka Yoshie. Following this win, he was once again pushed in that year&#x27;s Champion Carnival, earning big wins over established names such as Kawada and Kojima on his way to the final, where he lost to Kensuke Sasaki in Tokyo. With a strong record of wins against champion Satoshi Kojima, Jamal began to pursue the Triple Crown once again in August, culminating in a match between the two in Sapporo on September 1, where Jamal was once again defeated. After this, he once again entered the Real World Tag League with Kea, however, they failed to advance past the group stages. Jamal left All Japan Pro Wrestling in December 2005.

=== Return to WWE (2005–2009)===

==== Undefeated streak (2005–2007)====

In December 2005, Fatu had re-signed with World Wrestling Entertainment. Fatu returned on the April 3, 2006, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; with a new character called Umaga, the same name of the final and most painful part of the Samoan tattooing process, meaning &quot;the end&quot;; he was depicted as a destructive savage who could be controlled only by his manager, Armando Alejandro Estrada. Umaga attacked Ric Flair in his debut at the orders of Estrada. He then defeated Flair at Backlash on April 30.

In mid–2006, Umaga started a winning streak against the majority of the Raw roster, including going over top stars John Cena, Shawn Michaels, and Triple H. His next feud started on August 20 at SummerSlam, where he was supposed to be an enforcer on behalf of Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon during their match against D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels and Triple H), only to be attacked by Kane as he made his entrance. Umaga feuded with Kane for the next two months until Umaga won a Loser Leaves Raw match on the October 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, sending Kane off of the brand. After being separated by different brands, Umaga and Kane had one final match at Cyber Sunday on November 5, where Umaga again defeated Kane.

Umaga, having still not been pinned, was then deemed the number one contender for the WWE Championship and placed into a feud with then-champion John Cena over the title. Cena retained his belt at the New Year&#x27;s Revolution pay-per-view by pinning Umaga with a roll-up, officially ending his undefeated streak, which had lasted 34 televised matches and spanned from his re-debut in April 2006 to January 7, 2007. In that time, Umaga was never pinned or made to submit on television, but he suffered two losses by disqualification and another in a double countout. For the rest of the month, Armando Alejandro Estrada played down Cena&#x27;s victory, claiming it was a fluke, until a Last Man Standing rematch was signed for the Royal Rumble. On an episode of &quot;Raw&quot; between the two pay-per-views, Umaga attacked Cena causing a worked injury to his spleen and putting the match in jeopardy. Cena kayfabe refused a medical exam, the results of which could cause him to forfeit his title, and then defeated Umaga at the Royal Rumble on January 28 after wrapping a loosened ring rope around his neck during an STFU.

====Intercontinental Champion (2007–2008)====

On the February 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Umaga was named Vince McMahon&#x27;s representative for &quot;Battle of the Billionaires&quot; with Donald Trump at WrestleMania 23. Immediately after choosing Umaga, McMahon granted him a match against the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy, which he won to win the Intercontinental Championship. After Bobby Lashley was named Trump&#x27;s representative, the two began a feud which lasted even beyond WrestleMania. At WrestleMania on April 1, Umaga lost the Battle of the Billionaires&#x27; hair versus hair match and caused McMahon to get his head shaved. On the April 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lashley interfered in a match and helped a planted fan, Santino Marella, defeat Umaga for the Intercontinental Championship. On April 29 at Backlash, Umaga, Vince, and Shane McMahon wrestled Lashley for his ECW World Championship in a handicap match, winning the title for Vince. Umaga would continue to be involved with that feud, competing at Judgment Day on May 20 in a rematch for the ECW World Championship, which was once again a handicap match with the McMahons and Umaga taking on Lashley, which Lashley won. However, Lashley did not win the ECW World Championship because he pinned Shane and not the champion, Vince. The feud culminated on June 3 at One Night Stand, with Umaga aiding Vince in defending the ECW World Championship against Lashley in a Street Fight, which Vince lost.
In June, Umaga was re-entered into a feud with Marella. When they met at the pay-per-view on June 24, Umaga was solidly in control of the match, but lost by disqualification when he disregarded the referee&#x27;s instructions and continued to punch Marella. In a rematch on the July 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Umaga defeated Marella to win the Intercontinental Championship for the second time. On the August 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Umaga turned face by joining forces with John Cena to face Carlito and Randy Orton in a tag team match on August 13, which they won. He defeated both Carlito and Mr. Kennedy in a triple threat match at SummerSlam on August 26 to retain the Intercontinental Championship. He then interrupted a match between Kennedy and the returning Jeff Hardy the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, assaulting Hardy and leaving him lying in the ring, thus turning heel once again. One week later, on the September 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Umaga lost the Intercontinental Championship to Hardy.

Later that night, he teamed with Carlito in a handicap match against Triple H, after which Triple H struck him several times with his signature sledgehammer, injuring him. He was given a match against Triple H on October 7 at No Mercy, which was changed to a title match for the WWE Championship during the event when Triple H won the title earlier that night. Umaga was defeated by Triple H in their match. At Survivor Series on November 18, his team lost to Triple H&#x27;s team in a Survivor Series match. On March 30 at WrestleMania XXIV, Umaga was defeated by Batista.

==== Final feuds (2008–2009) ====
On June 23, 2008, Umaga was drafted to the SmackDown brand, as a part of the 2008 WWE draft. Umaga suffered a torn PCL at a live event in Johnson City, Tennessee, on August 2. After two promos hyping his return to the brand, on the January 30, 2009, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Umaga returned with a new entrance theme, defeating Jimmy Wang Yang. Umaga then suffered his first defeat since his return against Triple H by disqualification on the March 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after The Legacy attacked Triple H. 

On the May 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Umaga returned from a two-month hiatus, attacking CM Punk on multiple occasions, repeatedly interrupting Punk&#x27;s attempts to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase. On May 17 at Judgment Day, Umaga defeated Punk, but lost to Punk at Extreme Rules on June 7 in a Samoan Strap match, ending their feud in what was Umaga&#x27;s last appearance in WWE. On June 8, 2009, WWE announced that Fatu was released from his WWE contract. It was later revealed that his termination was due to violation of the Wellness Policy; even though this was only his second failure, his refusal to enter rehabilitation led to his dismissal.

===Independent circuit (2009)===
On July 11, 2009, Umaga appeared at the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in Puerto Rico, defeating Mr. Anderson (formerly Mr. Kennedy). In November, Umaga appeared on Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Hulkamania Tour of Australia under the ring name Uso Fatu. On November 24, Fatu defeated Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake, and two days later, he and Orlando Jordan lost to Beefcake and Mr. Anderson. On November 28, 2009, Fatu wrestled his final match, where he was defeated by Anderson. Shortly before his death, Fatu reportedly reached an agreement to return to WWE at the Royal Rumble in January 2010.

==Personal life==
Fatu and his wife L.T. had four children, one of whom, being his son Isayah, is also a professional wrestler, having trained in Booker T&#x27;s Reality of Wrestling promotion in December 2022. He would make his professional wrestling debut on July 15, 2023 under the ring name &quot;Zilla Fatu&quot;, but left the promotion three months later with Booker citing irreconcilable differences. They later reconciled and Isayah returned to working for ROW.

During the weekend of August 30, 2007, articles posted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named Fatu as one of many superstars to have purchased pharmaceuticals from an online pharmacy, which was a violation of the WWE &quot;Talent Wellness&quot; program. Fatu specifically was said to have received somatotropin, a growth hormone, between July and December 2006, after the &quot;no drugs from online sources&quot; rule was instituted. In June 2009, Fatu violated the Wellness Policy once again; due to his uncooperation and refusal to attend drug rehabilitation, he was released from his WWE contract.

On April 27, 2008, Fatu&#x27;s mother Vera died after a seven-year battle with cancer.

==Death and legacy==
On December 4, 2009, Fatu was found by his wife on the couch in their Houston, Texas home, unresponsive and with blood coming from his nose. A 911 call was made and Fatu was rushed to a hospital by ambulance. Paramedics determined Fatu was suffering a heart attack and they were able to restart his heart, although he showed no signs of brain activity. He was kept on life support for much of that Friday, and later suffered a second heart attack; he was ultimately pronounced dead at around 5:00PM CST. He was 36 years old. Toxicology reports revealed that Fatu had the drugs hydrocodone (a painkiller), carisoprodol (Soma, a muscle relaxant), and diazepam (Valium) in his system. Houston medical examiners also found that Fatu had both heart and liver disease. It was determined that the combination of Fatu&#x27;s repeated drug use and his heart disease ultimately led to his death, which was officially ruled to have been due to a heart attack brought on by an acute toxicity of multiple substances. On the day of his death, his nephews The Usos (Jonathan and Joshua) signed their developmental contracts with the company through Florida Championship Wrestling.

His other nephew, Joseph (better known as Solo Sikoa) uses the Samoan Spike as his finisher in tribute.

His son, Zilla, also uses the Samoan Spike as his finisher.

==Other media==
As Umaga, Fatu appears as a playable character in &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K22&quot; as downloadable content, &quot;WWE 2K23&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;.

<text>Staubbach Falls ( (sing.), lit.: dust creek fall) is a waterfall in Switzerland, located just west of Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Highlands. The waterfall drops from a hanging valley that ends in overhanging cliffs above the Weisse Lütschine.

The stream, on reaching the verge of the rocky walls of the valley, forms a cascade so high that it is almost lost in spray before it reaches the level of the valley. After rain, and early in the season when fed by melting snow, Staubbach Falls is very striking. The force of the stream above the fall at such times is sufficient to carry the water clear of the precipice, and the whole mass descends in a condition of liquid dust, between spray and cloud, that sways to-and-fro with the gentlest breeze. In a dry summer, when the supply of water is much reduced, the effect is comparatively insignificant.

A visit by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1779 provided the inspiration for his poem &quot;Gesang der Geister über den Wassern&quot;.

The falls were featured on the 3-centime Swiss postage stamp of the 1930s.

<doc id="946051" wikidata="Q641113" url="?curid=946051" title="Augusto Tasso Fragoso">
<text>General Augusto Tasso Fragoso, better known as Tasso Fragoso (28 August 1869 – 20 September 1945) was a Brazilian soldier, judge of the Superior Military Tribunal (&quot;Superior Tribunal Militar&quot;, STM) and writer. During the Revolution of 1930 he was president of the Provisional Government Board of 1930, which ruled Brazil from 24 October to 3 November, between the deposition of President Washington Luis and the inauguration of Getúlio Vargas.

He was also the cousin of Portuguese President António Óscar Fragoso Carmona.

He was the first citizen from Maranhão to become President of Brazil.

== Early life ==
Augusto Tasso Fragoso was born in São Luís, state capital of Maranhão, in 1869. In his official documents he says that he was born in 1867, due to the change, common at the time, made by his father so that he could start his military life earlier.

It was the result of the union of Maria Custódia de Souza Fragoso, born in Pará, and Joaquim Coelho Fragoso, a Portuguese from Baião, district of Porto.

His father, Joaquim, was the manager of the &quot;Companhia de Navegação Fluvial&quot; and, according to the biographer of Tasso Fragoso, to whom &quot;“the province [of Maranhão] already owed the foundation of several industrial companies”&quot;. For his services, he was appointed vice-consul of Portugal in Maranhão and later elevated to the rank of Consul of Ceará and Piauí in 1894.

== Career ==

=== Republican Coup ===
A military man, while still young, he became acquainted, in Rio de Janeiro, with the positivist ideas disseminated by Benjamin Constant.

Promoted to &quot;alferes-aluno&quot; (officer cadet) in January 1889, from April onwards he attended the General Staff and Engineering courses at the &quot;Escola Superior de Guerra&quot; (Superior War College), earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics and physical and natural sciences. During this period, he participated in the articulations of the movement for the implantation of the Republic in Brazil. In October, when relations between the emperor, Dom Pedro II, and the army were tense, he spoke on behalf of his colleagues in honor of Benjamin Constant, affirming everyone&#x27;s determination to accompany the professor &quot;“in the transformation about to take place in our country”&quot;. After this act, Benjamim Constant was dismissed from his duties and the students were reprimanded.

Around November 15, upon hearing of movements for the proclamation of the Republic, Tasso Fragoso, in uniform and armed, joined other comrades and headed for the school, where everyone awaited the arrival of Benjamim Constant and General Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca.

Subsequently, he took over, together with the then officer cadet Cândido Mariano Rondon, to ascertain the position of then Admiral Eduardo Wandenkolk regarding the movement, which ended up toppling the monarchy and implemented the new form of government in the country.

In 1891, he assumed the Head of the Department of Works and General Transportation of the Federal District - then Rio de Janeiro -, holding the position until the month of April of the following year. In 1893, as a loyalist, he participated in the repression of the &quot;Revolta da Armada&quot;, which intended to overthrow the government of Floriano Peixoto. In 1908, he traveled to Europe as a member of the General Staff of Minister of War Hermes da Fonseca.

=== Military attaché in Argentina ===
Appointed military attaché to the Brazilian legation in Argentina, Tasso Fragoso traveled to that country in July 1909, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in December of that same year. Back in Brazil, in July 1910, he assumed command of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, headquartered in Uruguaiana (RS), where he remained until April 1913. During this period, he exercised temporarily command of the 2nd Brigade of Cavalry, several times.
In 1914, he was appointed Head of the Military House by President Venceslau Brás, remaining in this position until 1917. During this period, he played an important role in implementing compulsory military service and in remodeling the Army amid the changes taking place as Brazil entered in World War I.

=== Generalship ===
Tasso Fragoso attained generalship in 1918. On 21 November 1922, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army, where he remained until 24 January 1929. He stood out in the process of remodeling the Army guided by the French Military Mission. He resigned as head of the EME in 1929, for disagreeing with the body&#x27;s decisions relating to the restructuring of military education in the country.

=== Deposition of Washington Luis ===
Dedicated to his professional career and far from political struggles, Tasso Fragoso refused an invitation to participate in the Revolution of 1930. The armed confrontation between government officials and revolutionaries throughout the country, however, ended up making him accept the request of General Mena Barreto who indicated his name to, as the longest-serving officer in the country, assume command of the military operation aimed at pacifying the country, and removing President Washington Luís.

Then, together with General Mena Barreto and Rear Admiral Isaías de Noronha, he headed and led the &quot;Junta Governativa&quot; that replaced the deposed President and transferred power to Getúlio Vargas, commander of the revolutionary forces.

On 30 March 1931, he returned to head the EME. He then participated in the fight against the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, but, considering himself sidelined from the most important decisions of that campaign, he again resigned as head of that body, on 22 August 1932.

=== Judge in the STM ===
On 22 April 1933, he was appointed Minister of the Supreme Military Tribunal (STM), a position he held until 19 February 1938, when he compulsorily retired due to the age limit. In reality, Tasso was 66 years old on that date and not 68, because his father, at the time of his enrollment in the Military School, had increased his age to reach the statutory minimum. His closed ones, aware of the circumstance, insisted that he require rectification. Tasso Fragoso refused the suggestion, claiming it would not be honest, after benefiting for years from his father&#x27;s appeal, coming out to denounce him and annul him for personal gain.

== Last days ==
He died of an incurable process of arteriosclerosis, and in his last days, there was &quot;a fact that serves to give the final touch to his figure as a true élite man&quot;, in the words of the then General Tristão de Alencar Araripe:“Enlightened intelligence, cultured spirit, General Tasso Fragoso was always opposed to the common creeds of our people, preferring, for the reason of his meditations, the subtle philosophism of the singular genius, who conceived one day the Religion of Humanity (...) But one day, Marina, his dear daughter, due to a treacherous illness, finds herself between life and death (...).

At Marina&#x27;s bed there were those who trusted more in God than in men. Thus, they remind the afflicted father to make an appeal to God (...). The sworn father had sworn to do everything to rob his daughter from death. Pleading on her behalf to a power he had not known until then was indispensable, as he was told! For she would ask, promising to join the number of those who believe in this God of infinite mercy.

And Marina was saved! We believe that we have fully explained the fact that so gratefully surprised the &quot;Carioca&quot; society yesterday: General Tasso Fragoso&#x27;s first communion”.Tasso Fragoso died in Rio de Janeiro, in 1945, at the age of 76. A street in the neighborhood of Lagoa, where he lived and died, takes his name. The city of Tasso Fragoso, in Maranhão, is a tribute to his name.

== Family ==
He married Josefa Graça Aranha, daughter of Temístocles Maciel Aranha and Maria da Glória de Alencastro Graça. His wife, therefore, was descended from the Baron of Aracati and Maria Adelaide do Carmo de Alencastro who, in turn, was the daughter of José Joaquim de Alencastro and Maria Eduarda Carneiro Leão, from a traditional Pernambucan family.

He had numerous children, of which were mentioned by Marshal Tristão de Alencar Araripe:

* Evangelina, whose union with banker Genésio Pires gave rise to the new Fragoso Pires family: José Carlos, Luiz Paulo, Fernando Tasso and Evangelina Catão. Evangelina (granddaughter) married the deputy, senator and businessman Álvaro Luís Bocaiuva Catão, in this relationship they had a daughter - Theodora Fragoso Pires Bocayuva Catão.
* Murilo, a diplomat, had descendants: Magui and Rosa Maria;
* Beatriz, with descendants: Beatriz;
* Heloisa, who begot Carlos Alberto and Maria Regina;
* Marina.

==Works==
Among the various technical and historical works he wrote, the following stand out:

* 1904 – &quot;Determinação da hora por alturas correspondentes de estrelas diversas 1908 — Determinação de latitude por alturas iguais de duas estrelas (método de Stechert)&quot;
* 1922 – &quot;A batalha do passo do Rosário&quot;
* 1934 – &quot;História da guerra entre a Tríplice Aliança e o Paraguai&quot; (5 volumes)

Prestes was the only politician to be elected President of Brazil and then impeded from taking office. He was also the last person born in São Paulo to be elected president until the election of Jair Bolsonaro in 2018.

On 23 June 1930, he became the second Brazilian featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Early career==
Prestes graduated with a law degree from the Law School of São Paulo (today the Faculty of Law of the University of São Paulo) in 1906. He married Alice Viana and had three children with her.

He started his political career in 1909, when he was elected State Representative in São Paulo by the Republican Party of São Paulo (PRP). He was re-elected several times until 1923, and became noted for his defense of public employees in São Paulo.

As a State Representative, he introduced legislation that created the Court of Auditors of São Paulo and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Zootechnology of the University of São Paulo. He was the author of the law that incorporated the Sorocabana Railroad in the São Paulo State patrimony.

In the São Paulo Revolt of 1924, Prestes fought on the Coluna Sul, with Ataliba Leonel and Washington Luís, expelling the rebels of the region of Sorocaba.

<text>Paul Steven Bostaph (born March 4, 1964) is an American drummer best known as a member of the thrash metal band Slayer, initially from 1992 to 2001, again from 2013 to 2019, and in 2024, after the reunion. His drumming career began in 1984 when he was 20 years old. In addition to Slayer, he has worked with bands such as Forbidden, Exodus, Systematic, Testament, and BlackGates. Metal-Rules.com describes Bostaph as &quot;a true professional and one of the best drummers on today&#x27;s metal music scene&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Early years (1964–1984) ===
Bostaph&#x27;s first interest was to play bass but he decided to play drums because he found a drum kit cheaper than a bass guitar. He approached rock music listening to the Beatles and the Beach Boys, but AC/DC got him into rock drumming. He bought his first drum kit at 15 and, after listening to &quot;Killers&quot; by Iron Maiden, he wanted to become a metal drummer. Other influences include bands like ELO, Blue Öyster Cult and Black Sabbath. His biggest drumming inspirations are Neil Peart, Phil Rudd, Clive Burr, Tommy Aldridge, Nicko McBrain, Cozy Powell, Jeff Porcaro, Steve Smith, Dave Lombardo, and Tommy Lee.

Bostaph attended Newark Memorial High School, in Newark, California. He had a strong dislike to his schooling years as he thought, &quot;I felt I had enough to get me through every day life, why do I need more?&quot; He was interested in sports and towards the end of his first year, his interest in music began, and he got a job, which took priority over his schooling.

=== Forbidden (1985–1992) ===
Bostaph played drums for Forbidden from 1985 to 1992, playing on their first two studio albums, &quot;Forbidden Evil&quot; and &quot;Twisted into Form&quot;. He also played on their 1989 live EP &quot;Raw Evil: Live at the Dynamo&quot;. Paul quit the band in 1992, and coincidentally the very next day received a phone call about auditioning for Slayer. In retrospect, Paul says that Forbidden was &quot;probably&quot; his favorite band that he&#x27;s ever played in because it was &quot;totally his band.&quot;

=== Slayer and solo project (1992–2001) ===
Following the departure of Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo in 1992, the band was looking for a new drummer. Lombardo&#x27;s drum tech was filling in, but constantly made errors. After auditioning several drummers and listening to hundreds of demo tapes, Bostaph was recommended by Slayer guitarist Kerry King&#x27;s guitar technician. Slayer members listened to Forbidden records, however, they did not see how Bostaph could fit into the Slayer momentum – Lombardo&#x27;s style being &quot;over the top&quot;, while Forbidden was more melodic. Slayer auditioned Bostaph with nine songs, and he made only one error on &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Bostaph had to continually practice to improve the strength of his hands and feet; &quot;I respected and loved Dave&#x27;s drumming but as a fan, if they got a new drummer and I bought a ticket to a show, I would expect to hear the stuff that Dave does, that&#x27;s what I would want. So, I went in and every time I had to learn a new song I would play them exactly how Dave played them&quot;.

Bostaph recorded four albums with Slayer; his least favorite is 1994&#x27;s &quot;Divine Intervention&quot;. This is due to the guitars not being loud enough as they were in the recording session, moving around to several recording studios, and a producer who had never done any heavy metal music. The producer changed near the end of recording to Toby Wright – Bostaph stating &quot;that record never had any consistency to it although a lot of fans still like it.&quot; Bostaph left the band in 1996 to concentrate on his solo project, Truth About Seafood, and was replaced by Jon Dette; however, he returned in 1997. His second favorite album is 2001&#x27;s &quot;God Hates Us All&quot;; &quot;The whole era that I was with the band that was the album that was the most well-rounded and mixed the best&quot; with &quot;Diabolus in Musica&quot;.

Bostaph departed from Slayer after the release of &quot;God Hates Us All&quot;, following a chronic elbow injury he had sustained that would hinder his ability to play. (although he later revealed that the actual reason for departure is because &quot;Musically, I wanted to do something else&quot;.) His third last performance with the band is recorded on the DVD &quot;War at the Warfield&quot; recorded on December 7, 2001. Bostaph is yet to watch it as he feels &quot;It&#x27;s like breaking up with a girlfriend&quot; and needs to move on with his life. He remained friends with Slayer members, and when asked if he would work with them in the future, he replied &quot;sure&quot;. Bostaph was temporarily replaced by original Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo, which later proved to be a permanent arrangement until 2013, when the band announced he had replaced Lombardo for the second time.

=== Systematic (2003–2004) ===
Unwilling to give up music, Bostaph joined Systematic in 2003 – a band which he had previously formed with vocalist Tim Narducci and guitarist Adam Ruppel before recording Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Diabolus in Musica&quot;. Bostaph introduced the band to Slayer&#x27;s manager – Rick Sales – to help the band gain notice. As the band needed a drummer in 2003, Bostaph was willing to help out.

Bostaph toured with Systematic for four months, although departed in 2004 stating: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t having very much fun and it&#x27;s not for me.&quot; In 2003 Bostaph sustained an injury to his knee, while playing soccer. After finishing Systematics tour, Bostaph underwent surgery – not touching a drum kit for over a year until he received a phone call from Exodus members.

=== Exodus (2005–2007) ===
Bostaph received a phone call from Exodus&#x27; manager, who asked him to join the band. Exodus bass guitarist Jack Gibson talked to guitarist Gary Holt if they should recruit Bostaph – Holt knew Bostaph while Exodus toured with Forbidden, as both bands were from the San Francisco Bay Area. When Bostaph received the phone call, two members had already left Exodus, and drummer Tom Hunting was thinking about leaving. Bostaph knew how to play all the records except for &quot;Impact Is Imminent&quot;, and recorded drums on the band&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Shovel Headed Kill Machine&quot;.

Bostaph asserts the album is different from the band&#x27;s previous albums; &quot;It&#x27;s so different because &quot;Bonded...&quot; was such a landmark record, such a great record that…I watched the band the whole time and I think this is a more, probably, the most brutal record the band has done since &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot;.&quot; Bostaph also says the chemistry between members was very different, due to three out of five members being replaced in one year; &quot;it&#x27;s a totally different band than before.&quot; The band toured for over a year promoting &quot;Shovel Headed Kill Machine&quot;, and wished to enter the recording studio to record another as soon as possible. However, on March 28, 2007, Bostaph announced that he parted ways with Exodus; &quot;They now have their original drummer Tom Hunting back in the band. I always said from the start if Tom ever wanted to come back, the drum throne is his. I have the greatest respect for Tom and his playing.&quot; Bostaph also announced he is no longer endorsing TAMA drum kits, and is proud to represent Drum Workshop and their products.

=== Testament (2007–2011) ===
Bostaph was asked to play some shows for Testament in 1992, to help the band with some live dates they had committed to. He accepted, even though he had already officially joined Slayer by this time. These shows temporarily reteamed Bostaph with his ex-Forbidden (band) bandmate Glen Alvelais. The November 27 show with this line-up at the Hollywood Palladium was captured on the Testament live EP &quot;Return to the Apocalyptic City&quot;.

Testament&#x27;s official website announced Bostaph rejoined the group in October 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Former SLAYER/EXODUS Drummer PAUL BOSTAPH Looking For New Band &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Formation of Damnation&quot; was the first Testament studio album of all new material in nine years, and the first to feature Alex Skolnick on guitar since 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Ritual&quot;, also the first to feature bassist Greg Christian since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; was released on April 29, 2008. This is also the first full length Testament studio album to feature Bostaph on drums. This album was awarded the 2008 &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; by the Metal Hammer Awards.

In June 2011, Testament began recording their next studio album, entitled &quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot;, expected to be released on April 27, 2012. However, due to a &quot;serious injury&quot; (tendonitis in his wrist), Paul was not involved in the recording sessions; Gene Hoglan (who previously played on the band&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Demonic&quot;) filled in for him. He was expected to rejoin Testament when they tour to support the album. However, frontman Chuck Billy stated in December 2011 that Bostaph has left the band again.

=== Return to Slayer (2013–2019) ===
On May 30, 2013, Slayer announced via their official Facebook page that Paul Bostaph had returned once again to replace long-time member Dave Lombardo behind the kit on a full-time basis. He appeared on Slayer&#x27;s twelfth and final studio album &quot;Repentless&quot;, and stayed with the band until 2019, when they disbanded after finishing their final tour.

=== Other projects ===
Bostaph is also a member of a tribute band called HAIL!. HAIL!&#x27;s rotating cast of members include Andreas Kisser, Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, David Ellefson, Mike Portnoy, Jimmy DeGrasso and Roy Mayorga. Ripper, DeGrasso, Ellefson and Kisser formed the band in late 2008. The band, toured Europe in 2009 and in June 2010 HAIL! is on their second European tour with the following line-up: Andreas Kisser, Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, Paul Bostaph and James LoMenzo. Due to the death of announced bassist Paul Gray, LoMenzo agreed on only one day&#x27;s notice to fly to Portugal and rescue the Rock in Rio Festival where HAIL! was scheduled to perform on May 30, 2010.

In 2013, Bostaph also worked with Geoff Tate, who at that point had control of the Queensrÿche band name. The subsequent album, Frequency Unknown saw Bostaph play on several of the tracks though he was not an official member of the band.

In addition, Bostaph played drums for the Bay Area metal band BlackGates from 2009 to 2014. The band also featured Dan Nelson on vocals and rhythm guitar. The band released a three-song EP in 2010, recorded and mixed by Tim Narducci of Systematic. Also released were the singles &quot;Burn Eternal&quot; (2012), and &quot;Overcome&quot; (2014).

Bostaph reunited with his former Slayer bandmate Kerry King on the latter&#x27;s upcoming 2024 solo debut album, &quot;From Hell I Rise&quot;.

== Equipment ==
Bostaph currently endorses Yamaha drums, Remo drumheads, Paiste cymbals and Promark drumsticks.

<text>José Linhares (; 28 January 1886 – 26 January 1957) was a Brazilian lawyer who briefly served as the interim president of Brazil in the final months of the Estado Novo. As President of the Supreme Federal Court, he was called by the Armed Forces to take over the Presidency following the ousting of Getúlio Vargas in 1945, to the inauguration of Eurico Gaspar Dutra, in 1946, which marked the beginning of what is known today as the Fourth Brazilian Republic.

Linhares was appointed Minister of the Supreme Federal Court in 1937, following the retirement of Ataúlfo Nápoles de Paiva, and served until his own retirement in 1956. He was twice President of the Supreme Federal Court, from 1945 to 1949, and from 1954 to 1956.

Linhares devoted himself mainly to prepare the return to democratic order, replacing the stakeholders in the states by judiciary members, giving the new parliament constitution-making powers, extinguishing the Court of National Security, abolishing the state of emergency, provided in the 1937 Constitution, among other measures. In the economic and administrative field, acted against inflation, revoked the antitrust law, one of the factors that led to the deposition of Vargas, and extinguished the Council of People&#x27;s Economy. Granted autonomy to the University of Brazil and regulated various departments of the Ministry of Transportation and Public Works. In December 1945 elections were held for the presidency and the National Constituent Assembly. José Linhares remained in office until the inauguration of the elected president, Eurico Gaspar Dutra.

<text>Ator 2 – L&#x27;invincibile Orion (&quot;Ator 2: Orion the Invincible&quot;), a.k.a. English title: The Blade Master, is a 1982 Italian sword-and-sandal film directed by Joe D&#x27;Amato, and starring Miles O&#x27;Keeffe as Ator, Charles Borromel as Akronos, Lisa Foster as Mila, the daughter of Akronos, and David Brandon as Zor.

== Plot ==
Akronos has discovered the Geometric Nucleus during the course of his research. The Nucleus is a device of incredible power that could be a terrible weapon. Akronos feels that the Nucleus must be kept from evil men at all costs. When he learns that the evil Zor and his army are approaching his castle, he asks his daughter Mila to bring his former student Ator back to help defeat Zor. Mila runs away to find Ator. Zor&#x27;s soldiers enter and begin beating Akronos, but Zor angrily sends them away to maintain the image of a man who would only use violence if needed.

Mila is pursued by Zor&#x27;s soldiers and is wounded by them but continues to stagger towards Ator&#x27;s home. At last, she arrives, and Ator uses his medical knowledge to heal her wound. She then is able to convince him she is the daughter of Akronos, and that her father is in terrible danger.

Mila, Ator, and Ator&#x27;s Asian assistant Thong begin the journey back to Akronos&#x27; castle, facing various dangers along the way, including a group of cannibals, another group determined to sacrifice them to their god — which is a huge snake — and other soldiers.

Finally, they make it back to the castle. While Mila and Thong sneak in the back way, Ator uses his knowledge of flight to quickly create a hang glider, which he flies over the castle, dropping bombs on Zor&#x27;s soldiers. Having defeated most of Zor&#x27;s forces, Ator takes on Zor himself and defeats him. Akronos convinces Ator to let Zor live to face trial, but when Ator steps away, Zor grabs a sword to threaten Ator, and Zor is killed by Thong.

Afterward, Akronos gives the Geometric Nucleus to Ator. Ator tells Mila he has to leave, that his life is too dangerous to share with her. Mila says that she knows Ator must fight evil where ever it occurs. Ator leaves Thong behind to help take care of Mila and Akronos, and leaves. He takes the Nucleus to a distant land, where he destroys it in a massive nuclear detonation.

==Cast==
* Miles O&#x27;Keeffe as Ator
* Lisa Foster as Mila
* Charles Borromel as Akronos
* Chen Wong as Thong, Ator&#x27;s teacher
* David Brandon (credited as David Cain Haughton) as Zor
* Nancy Hall as 1st maiden
* Linette Ray as 2nd maiden
* Sandra Carle as Old woman
* Osiride Peverello as Sadur
* Nello Pazzafini as Warrior captain
* Salvatore Baccaro as Caveman
* Tricia Pettitt as Cavewoman

==Production==
In early 1983, a few months after &quot;Ator, the Fighting Eagle&quot; was a commercial success, D&#x27;Amato embarked on a new project, casting Miles O&#x27;Keeffe again as the lead and Lisa Foster as his partner. D&#x27;Amato and scriptwriter José Maria Sanchez, who had already worked on the first &quot;Ator&quot; film, prepared a prehistoric film in the vein of the successful Academy Award-winning French film &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (1981). The working title was &quot;Adamo ed Eva&quot;. According to D&#x27;Amato, when everything was ready for the shoot and rehearsals had already begun, Miles O&#x27;Keeffe backed out for religious and moral reasons. Mark Gregory played the lead role in &quot;Adamo ed Eva&quot;.

O&#x27;Keeffe starred in &quot;Ator 2&quot; instead. D&#x27;Amato commented that &quot;&quot;Ator 2&quot; was made in great haste and almost without a script&quot;, and includes footage from the first &quot;Ator&quot; film in the form of flashbacks. D&#x27;Amato said they made it to take advantage of a contract they had with Miles O&#x27;Keefe.

==Release==
===Italy===
According to Kinnard &amp; Crnkovich, the film was released in Italy on December 16, 1982, while Michele Giordano states that filming only began in early 1983 and both Michele Giordano and Roberto Poppi maintain that the film was never theatrically released in Italy. On VHS, it was released by Eureka Video as &quot;Ator l&#x27;invincibile&quot;, which is the cinematic title of the first part.

===United States===
&quot;Ator 2&quot; was released in the United States as &quot;The Blade Master&quot; on February 15, 1984 with a 92 minute running time. The film was shown on American television under the title &quot;The Cave Dwellers&quot;, a version of the film that included footage from the film &quot;Taur the Mighty&quot;.

===Other countries===
The film has also been released under the titles &quot;Ator the Invincible&quot; (Great Britain), &quot;Ator II - Der Unbesiegbare&quot; (Germany), and both &quot;Ator, el invencible&quot; and &quot;Ator 2, el invencible&quot; (Spain).

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Total Film&quot; included &quot;Ator 2 – L&#x27;invincibile Orion&quot; in their list of the 66 worst films of all time.

In its &quot;Cave Dwellers&quot; TV version (sold by Film Ventures International), the film was parodied as the third season premiere of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

<text>Forbidden is an American thrash metal band from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. They formed in 1985 as Forbidden Evil, but would change their name in 1987. Since their formation, Forbidden have broken up and reformed twice with numerous line-up changes. After breaking up for the first time in 1997, Forbidden reunited once again in 2007, went into an indefinite hiatus in 2012, but reformed in 2023. The current line-up of the band is Norman Skinner (vocals), Craig Locicero (guitar), Matt Camacho (bass), and Chris Kontos (drums).

Along with Death Angel, Vio-lence, Defiance, Testament and Exodus (the latter of the two had featured original Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph), they were one of the most successful Bay Area thrash metal bands and earned a loyal fanbase in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with their debut album &quot;Forbidden Evil&quot; (1988) regarded by critics as a classic thrash metal album and the follow-up, &quot;Twisted into Form&quot; (1990), as something of a masterpiece within the &quot;tech-thrash&quot; genre. Their earlier style was technical thrash metal, but the band later experimented with alternative and groove metal elements on their fourth album &quot;Green&quot; (1997).

Forbidden has also been credited as one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, along with Exodus, Testament, Death Angel, Lȧȧz Rockit and Vio-lence.

==History==
===Initial career (1985–1997)===
The origins of the band date back to early 1985 when they were founded as &#x27;Forbidden Evil&#x27; by drummer Jim Pittman and guitarist Robb Flynn (later of Vio-lence and Machine Head), with the original lineup being completed by Craig Locicero (guitar), Russ Anderson (vocals) and John Tegio (bass). Flynn named the band after a song by the Chicago band War Cry that was featured on the Metal Massacre 4 compilation. They recorded demo tapes and appeared on the now-out-of-print live album &quot;The Eastern Front – Live At Ruthie&#x27;s Inn&quot;. By 1986, Jim Pittman, John Tegio, and Robb Flynn left the band and were replaced by Paul Bostaph (drums), Matt Camacho (bass) and Glen Alvelais (guitar). Then in 1987, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to Forbidden in order to prevent the band from being mistakenly perceived as a black metal band.

After considering offers from several record labels, the band signed with Combat Records in 1988 and released their debut album &quot;Forbidden Evil&quot; in September of that year. The album included three songs written by former guitarist Robb Flynn (&quot;Chalice Of Blood&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Evil&quot;, and &quot;As Good As Dead&quot;). The album was promoted by touring the U.S. and Europe for the remainder of 1988 and into 1989, sharing the stage with the likes of Testament, Exodus, Holy Moses, Sepultura, Death Angel, Sacred Reich, Voivod, Savatage, Vio-lence, Dark Angel and Pestilence (not to be confused with the Dutch death metal band of the same name). When the &quot;Forbidden Evil&quot; tour ended, Alvelais left the band and was replaced by guitarist Tim Calvert. The band&#x27;s only live album &quot;Raw Evil - Live at the Dynamo&quot; EP, was also released in 1989.

Forbidden&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Twisted Into Form&quot;, was released in 1990, which saw the band showcase a more melodic and progressive sound with many acoustic interludes and clearer production, and less of a raw edge than its predecessor. In support of this album, they opened for Death Angel on their &quot;Act III&quot; tour in Europe and North America, and also played with bands such as Exodus, Sepultura, Vicious Rumors, Sanctuary, Fates Warning, Sacred Reich, Obituary, Morbid Angel, Realm, Defiance and Forced Entry.

Internal and managerial problems led to the band leaving Combat Records in 1991. This was followed by another line-up change when drummer Paul Bostaph left to replace Dave Lombardo in Slayer. Bostaph was replaced by drummer Steve Jacobs. In 1993 amidst writing and rehearsing material for Forbidden&#x27;s third studio album, Craig Locicero filled the guitar slot for Death during a three-week European tour.

The band signed to GUN Records in 1994 and released their third album &quot;Distortion&quot; in November. They toured Europe with Gorefest to promote the album into 1995 and followed that with U.S. dates with Testament and Malevolent Creation. They spent 1996 writing and recording darker, angrier material for their fourth album &quot;Green&quot; which was released in early 1997. Lack of support for the album from GUN Records and no tour scheduled to promote it, as well as Locicero wanting to go in a different creative direction, led to Forbidden breaking up in 1997. He along with Matt Camacho and Steve Jacobs would soon form the first incarnation of Manmade God the same year.

===Reunions and &quot;Omega Wave&quot; (2001–2010)===
In August 2001, Anderson, Bostaph, Alvelais and Camacho reformed for a one-time, six song performance for Chuck Billy&#x27;s &quot;Thrash of the Titans&quot; benefit concert, using their original name Forbidden Evil. Guitarist Steve Smyth stood in for Craig Locicero who was unable to join the event due to his commitment to recording with Manmade God. Former guitarist Tim Calvert also performed for the final three songs of the set while drummer Jeremy Colson performed two songs on drums before Bostaph performed four songs.

In 2007 Forbidden reformed again for reunion shows to take place in 2008 both in the US and in Europe. The reunion initially featured the &quot;Forbidden Evil&quot; line-up from 2001, this time including Craig Locicero but without Paul Bostaph, who had prior commitments with Testament. Gene Hoglan (of Dark Angel, Death and Strapping Young Lad fame) played drums for the band&#x27;s first few reunion shows. After Hoglan, Mark Hernandez (ex-Vio-lence, Heathen, Defiance) took over on the drums for the band&#x27;s European tour, which included an appearance on the main stage at Belgium&#x27;s Graspop festival. They also played some Japanese dates later in the year. After the tour, Glen Alvelais quit the group, stating that he felt he &quot;could no longer take all the accusations and distrust that came with our so-called chemistry.&quot; Guitarist Steve Smyth stepped in as Alvelais&#x27; replacement. In the summer of 2009 they toured Europe and the U.S. once more, performing their second album &quot;Twisted Into Form&quot; in its entirety.

In 2009 Forbidden began talks with Nuclear Blast Records about recording a fifth studio album for the label. The new album, &quot;Omega Wave&quot;, was released in 2010. The band toured extensively in the U.S., Europe and South America to promote the album.

===Switching drummers, hiatus and third reunion (2011–present)===
In August 2011, drummer Mark Hernandez left Forbidden, citing personal reasons. Gene Hoglan replaced him for a few shows, including Alcatraz Festival. In November of that year, the band announced their new drummer was Sasha Horn. However, in July 2012 when Matt Camacho announced he was leaving the band to pursue his legal career and Russ Anderson stated his intention to &quot;take a break&quot; from the music business, Forbidden was effectively over once more, with Locicero stating in 2013: &quot;Unfortunately, I think Russ is finished, and by the time he would want to step up and do it again, it would be too late. It became painfully obvious to me that Russ really wasn&#x27;t cut out for the road anymore and that&#x27;s why Forbidden broke up the first time. I ended up doing too much work and I needed everyone to step up and help me out, and the same thing started happening again; when the original members aren&#x27;t really motivated, it&#x27;s just not fun anymore. So I don&#x27;t think I ever want to go backwards again.&quot;

Although Forbidden had not performed live since 2012 nor been active since the split with Camacho and Anderson, Locicero reported in April 2016 that the band was still under contract with Nuclear Blast. Despite not ruling out the possibility of a reunion, he stated, &quot;The schematics are very confusing here. When we ended, there was two members from out of state (one out of the country) plus Matt and Russ retired from music until further notice. All of this presents a large hurdle if we just &#x27;wanna get together to jam.&#x27; So you must understand that it is simply not likely. But as I stated, never say never.&quot;

In April 2023, Forbidden launched an official Instagram account, posting images displaying each letter of their band logo in front of a black background; those posts had led to speculation that a third reunion of Forbidden was in the works. This reunion was officially announced on April 19, with Norman Skinner replacing Russ Anderson (who is now retired from the music industry) on vocals.

Forbidden played their first show in 11 years on July 16, 2023 at Baltic Kiss in Richmond, which was held as a &quot;secret show&quot; under the name Twisted into Evil, followed nearly a month later by an appearance at the Alcatraz festival in Kortrijk. The band&#x27;s additional reunion dates included opening for Death Angel at two shows in San Francisco in December 2023, and appearing at the Hell&#x27;s Heroes Festival in Houston in March 2024. Forbidden is also currently writing new material for their next studio album, which is planned for an early 2025 release.

<text>João Fernandes Campos Café Filho (; 3 February 1899 – 20 February 1970) was a Brazilian politician who served as the 18th president of Brazil, taking office upon the suicide of President Getúlio Vargas. He was the first Protestant to occupy the position.

== Biography ==
===Early life and career===
Café Filho was born in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, 3 February 1899. He was the founder of the &quot;Jornal do Norte&quot; (1921), editor of the &quot;O Correio de Bezerros&quot; in the city of Bezerros, Pernambuco (1923), and director of the newspaper &quot;A Noite&quot; (1925), writing in the latter, articles in which he asked soldiers, corporals and young officers to refuse to fight the so-called &quot;Coluna Prestes&quot;, which resulted in his conviction to three months in prison. He then escaped to Bahia in 1927, under the alias Senílson Pessoa Cavalcanti, but eventually returned to Natal, where he surrendered. In 1923, he ran unsuccessfully for councilman of Natal.

He joined the Liberal Alliance, and was one of the founders, in 1933, of the Social Nationalist Party of Rio Grande do Norte (PSN). Café Filho was elected federal deputy (1935–1937) and stood out for the defense of constitutional liberties. Threatened with arrest, he sought asylum in Argentina, returning to Brazil in 1938. He founded, along with Ademar de Barros, the Progressive Republican Party (PRP), for which he was elected federal deputy again (1946–1950). He was elected vice president by a coalition of parties that merged under the symbol Progressive Social Party (PSP). As vice president, he also served as the president of the Senate. He took office as president following the suicide of incumbent Getúlio Vargas, 24 August 1954.

===Presidency===
After taking over as president, Café Filho appointed to his new cabinet minister of finance the economist Eugenio Gudin, supporter of a more orthodox economic policy, who sought to stabilize the economy and combat inflation. The Minister adopted key measures to contain credit and cutting public expenditure, seeking thereby to reduce the public concerned deficit in its assessment of the inflationary process. During the Café Filho government, the single tax on electricity was instituted, generating the Federal Electrification Fund, as well as the withholding tax on income from the labor wage. Notable in his administration was the creation of the Committee on Location of the New Federal Capital, and the inauguration, in January 1955, of the Paulo Afonso hydroelectric plant. Café Filho encouraged the inflow of foreign capital in the country, which would influence the process of industrialization that followed.

Temporarily removed from the presidency on 3 November 1955, due to a cardiovascular disorder, on November 8 he was replaced by Carlos Luz, the president of the Chamber of Deputies. Recovered, Café Filho tried to reassume presidential powers, but, as part of the 1955 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état, his removal was approved by the Congress on 22 November 1955 and confirmed by the Supreme Court in December.

His removal through impeachment, with the congress declaring him unable to discharge his duties, came after military pressure.

===Post-presidency===
After the presidency, Café Filho was appointed Councillor of the Court of Accounts of Guanabara (1961–1970).

He died in Rio de Janeiro on 20 February 1970.

The Bishop&#x27;s School was founded in 1909 by Ellen Browning Scripps and her half-sister (Eliza) Virginia Scripps, with gifts of land and funding, at the request of the Right Reverend Joseph Horsfall Johnson, at that time Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. Originally, it was a boarding school for girls only and Anna Frances O&#x27;Hare Bentham was appointed the inaugural headmistress.

The earliest parts of the campus were designed by architect Irving Gill, responsible for a multitude of buildings in La Jolla. The current tower building was designed by Carleton Winslow as a replacement for the original Gill tower.

Bishop&#x27;s became co-educational after merging with the nearby San Miguel School in 1971 under the leadership of headmaster Philip Perkins, who served until retirement in 1974 when Dorothy Anne Williams was appointed headmistress. The boarding department was closed after the 1982–1983 school year, and later that year Michael Teitelman was appointed headmaster.

The school expanded to include sixth grade in the fall of 2009, with the first cohort graduating in 2016. That same year, headmaster Michael Teitelman retired and Aimeclaire Lambert Roche was appointed head of school. During her time as head of school, Roche served as the President of the Association of Independent Schools.

In 2018, longtime Bishops’ administrator Carol Barry was appointed interim head of school when Aimeclaire Lambert Roche retired. In 2019, Ron Kim was appointed the permanent headmaster.

==Campus==
The Bishop&#x27;s School&#x27;s 11-acre campus is located in the heart of La Jolla. At the center of the campus is a grassy quadrangle, where tradition prohibits anyone from setting foot on &quot;the quad&quot; before noon.

The original campus surrounds the quad and includes buildings dating back to the turn of the twentieth century with many original buildings designed by famed architect Irving Gill, one of the pioneers of the modern movement in architecture. The school has been acquisitive of the surrounding real-estate, expanding the initial campus significantly over more than a century. Additions have included a science center, a football and field athletics center, and an aquatic center. The school has further plans to expand the campus.

The campus in its entirety was designated a historical landmark in 1998, with several buildings gaining individual historical standing of significance over the years starting in 1994: Bentham Hall (Irving Gill, 1909), Scripps Hall (Irving Gill, 1910–11), Gilman Hall (Irving Gill and Louis Gill, 1916), St. Mary&#x27;s Chapel (Carleton Winslow, 1916), The Tower (Carleton Winslow, 1930), Wheeler J. Bailey Library (Carleton Winslow, 1935), and gardens.

==Rankings==

The Bishop&#x27;s School has consistently been named a top private school both nationally and in California.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; recognized Bishop&#x27;s in 2007 for its high matriculation rate to eight selective American colleges, and CBS recognized the school in 2011 noting Bishop&#x27;s had higher matriculation rates to east-coast selective colleges than Deerfield Academy. The College Board&#x27;s Advanced Placement program ranked the AP Biology program the strongest in the nation for two consecutive years (2004 and 2005), as Bishop&#x27;s achieved the highest rate of achievement for medium-sized schools (300–799 students). As of 2023, Bishop’s remained ranked as the top Christian high school in California.

<doc id="946084" wikidata="Q269572" url="?curid=946084" title="Carlos Luz">
<text>Carlos Coimbra da Luz (; 4 August 1894 – 9 February 1961) was a Brazilian politician, lawyer, teacher and journalist who served as acting president of Brazil from November 8 to November 11, 1955.

After the political crisis following the Getúlio Vargas suicide in 1954, Carlos Luz was the second of three presidents who ruled Brazil in a brief period of 16 months. At the time of President Café Filho&#x27;s alleged illness in 1955 he was the president of the Chamber of Deputies, and so the next in the line of succession to the presidency, since Filho had been the vice president under Vargas. Luz headed the government only three days in November 1955 and was replaced, as part of the 1955 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état, by the vice-president of the Senate Nereu Ramos on the orders of the Minister of Defence Henrique Teixeira Lott over his fear that Luz might support a plot to prevent President-elect Juscelino Kubitschek from taking office in January 1956. Luz was removed by Congress, under pressure by the military, declaring him unable to fulfill his duties.

Luz was married to his first wife, Maria José Dantas Luz, from 1920 until her death in 1924. They had two children together. Later, Luz remained married to Graciema da Luz until his death in Rio de Janeiro in February 1961.

As of 2023, Luz remains the shortest-serving president of Brazil.

<doc id="946089" wikidata="Q2606262" url="?curid=946089" title="Maha Bodhi Society">
<text>The Maha Bodhi Society is a South Asian Buddhist society presently based in Kolkata, India. Founded by the Sri Lankan Buddhist leader Anagarika Dharmapala and the British journalist and poet Sir Edwin Arnold, its first office was in Bodh Gaya. The organization&#x27;s efforts began in order to resuscitate Buddhism in India, and to restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara. The restoration and revival of the glory and sanctity of Bodh Gaya are also aims of Maha Bodhi Society.
Although many Indians had remained culturally Buddhist for centuries after the decline of Buddhism, they did not self-identify as &quot;Buddhist&quot;. The Maha Bodhi Society renewed interest in Buddhism, and spawned the Ladakh Buddhist Association, All Assam Buddhist Association, and Himalayan Buddhist Society, as well as laying the grounds for the Dalit Buddhist movement.
==Origins==
In 1891, while on pilgrimage to the recently restored Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location where Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) attained enlightenment, Anagarika Dharmapala had experienced a shock to find the temple in the hands of a Saivite priest, the Buddha image transformed into a Hindu icon and Buddhists barred from worship. As a result, he began an agitation movement. Prior to that, in 1885 Sir Edwin Arnold visited the site and published several articles drawing the attention of the Buddhists to the deplorable conditions of Bodh Gaya. The Buddhist renaissance inaugurated by Anagarika Dharmapala through his Mahabodhi Movement has also been described as &quot;conservative&quot; for it considered Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent responsible for the decay of Buddhism in India, in the then current mood of Hindu-Buddhist brotherhood.
The Mahabodhi Society at Colombo was founded in 1891 but its offices were moved to Calcutta the following year. One of its primary aims was the restoration of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the chief of the four ancient Holy sites to Buddhist control. To accomplish this Dharmapala initiated a lawsuit against the Brahmin priests who had held control of the site for centuries. After a protracted struggle this was successful with the partial restoration of the site to the management of the Maha Bodhi Society in 1949.

Maha Bodhi Society branches have been established in several countries, most significantly in India and Sri Lanka. A United States branch was founded by Dr. Paul Carus in Chicago.

The , founded by Buddharakkhita Ācariya in 1956, is a sister organization that functions and is administered independently.

==Mahabodhi Temple==
After the defeat of the Palas by the Hindu Sena dynasty, Buddhism&#x27;s position again began to erode and was soon followed by the conquest of Magadha by General Ikhtiar Uddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiyar Khilji. During this period, the Mahabodhi Temple fell into disrepair and was largely abandoned. During the 16th century, a Hindu monastery was established near Bodh Gaya. Over the following centuries, the monastery&#x27;s abbot or mahant became the area&#x27;s primary landholder and claimed ownership of the Mahabodhi Temple grounds.

In the 1880s, the then-British government of India began to restore Mahabodhi Temple under the direction of Sir Alexander Cunningham. In 1885, Sir Edwin Arnold visited the site and published several articles drawing the attention of the Buddhists to the deplorable conditions of Buddhagaya. He was guided in this undertaking by Ven. Weligama Sri Sumangala. In 1891, Anagarika Dharmapala started a campaign to return control of the temple to Buddhists, over the objections of the &quot;mahant&quot;. The campaign was partially successful in 1949, when control passed from the Hindu mahant to the state government of Bihar, which established a temple management committee. The committee has nine members, a majority of whom, including the chairman, must by law be Hindus. Mahabodhi&#x27;s first head monk under the management committee was Anagarika Munindra, a Bengali man who had been an active member of the Maha Bodhi Society.

==Mulagandha Kuty Vihara in Sarnath==
Mulagandha Kuty Vihara in Sarnath is a fitting reminder of Sarnath&#x27;s past glory. It is also the crowning and most glorious achievement of Anagarika Dharmapala&#x27;s lifelong dedication.
The construction of the Mulagandha Kuty Vihara was taken up by Anagarika Dharmapala in 1926, towards the end of his pious life. When he decided to construct a temple at Sarnath and after making the architectural plans, his generous Hawaiian patron, Mary Robinson Foster, donated the first financial assistance that came from her parents, brother and well-wishers. Anagarika Dharmapala personally supervised the constructional works. The 200 feet high magnificent temple was opened to public in 1931. Later a reputed Japanese artist Kosetsu Nosu (1885- 1973) and his assistant undertook the task to decorate the temple walls with fresco paintings famously as the Mural paintings of Mulagandha Kuty Vihara, depicting the life events of Sakyamuni Buddha. On the opening day of the Vihara, the Buddha&#x27;s relics donated to Anagarika Dharmapala by Govt. of India under the British Raj was enshrined in the temple. The Vihara, an attractive place of Buddhist worship was visited by numerous Indian and foreign dignitaries and millions of pilgrims and tourists over the past decades. At the Mulagandha Kuty Vihara annual function in November, the most attractive item among the programs is the exposition of the Buddha&#x27;s sacred relic. People from different countries and from the homeland visit the Vihara to homage to the sacred relic considering it as a rare and an opportune moment in their lifetime.
== Publications ==
The Maha Bodhi Society has a robust tradition of publications, spanning from Pali translations into modern Indian vernacular languages (such as Hindi) to scholarly texts and new editions of Pali works typeset in Devanagari to appeal to a Hindi-educated Indian audience. They have also published books and pamphlets in local/regional languages and dialects, sometimes in partnership with other presses.

==Leadership==

Most Venerable P Seewalee Thero is serving as the 12th and current general secretary of the Maha Bodhi Society of India since 2016 and the joint secretaries are Venerable Kahatagollawe Medhankara Thero and Ven. Rathmalwa Sumithananda Thero.

At a meeting in September 2008, the Maha Bodhi Society passed a rule that only persons born into Buddhist families will be eligible to serve as president or as one of the vice-presidents of the society. The outgoing president, B. K. Modi, a Hindu, assumed the position of patron. At the same meeting, the 14th Dalai Lama was given the new title of chief patron.

<text>Elizabeth Millen Birch (born September 2, 1956) is an American attorney and former corporate executive who chaired the board of directors of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force from 1992 to 1994. She served as the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation&#x27;s largest LGBT organization, from January 1995 until January 2004.

==Education and law career==
Birch was born at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, in 1956. Her father was a Canadian Air Force officer and she lived on numerous Canadian Air Force bases in her youth. During high school, she joined Up With People, a student performance group, and toured Europe and North Africa for a year. Birch graduated from the University of Hawaiʻi in 1980 and earned a Juris Doctor degree at the Santa Clara University School of Law. She was an associate attorney with the law firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &amp; Enersen until joining Apple in 1989. She later earned a Ph.D. from the University of Hawaiʻi in 2004.

Birch was worldwide director of litigation for Apple Computer and general counsel for its Claris subsidiary until 1995.

==Activism==
Birch began her LGBT political activity as a member of the Bay Area Municipal Elections Committee (BAYMEC), an LGBT political action committee based in a San Jose, California. She was co-chairwoman of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force from 1992 to 1994.

Birch joined the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) as executive director in January 1995. Over the next several years she dramatically increased its size in both membership and budget. Her marketing approach to political organization provoked criticism that HRC was setting an agenda through its influence on sources of funding to the exclusion of local initiatives. In 2003, the organization opened its national headquarters building in Washington, D.C. During her tenure, a major problem arose when the HRC endorsed New York Senator Al D&#x27;Amato for re-election in 1998 when he was opposed by Chuck Schumer. Birch was executive director of the HRC until January 2004 when she left to spend more time with her partner, Hilary Rosen, and their children. She joined the Howard Dean presidential campaign as a senior advisor. She then became a professional public speaker.

Birch was still the executive director of HRC when its staff and board of directors, with her encouragement, &quot;discussed and then finally decided to add the &#x27;T&#x27; to the organization’s mission statement&quot; in 2001, although the organization still supported the non-transgender version of ENDA, saying that it did not have a chance to pass into law if transgender protections were added; the HRC modified this stance in August 2004.

In 2000, Birch became the first leader of an LGBT organization to address a national political convention when she gave a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention.

==Later career==
In 2004, Birch launched Birch &amp; Company, a consulting firm, with offices in Washington, D.C., and New York. Birch ran Rosie O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s production company, KidRo Productions, Inc. and oversaw O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Foundation, The For All Kids Foundation until 2007.

Birch also hosts a talk show on here!. Her guests have included Howard Dean, Pat Buchanan, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and John Lewis.

==Personal life==
She had a relationship with Hilary Rosen, former chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America. They adopted twins, a boy and a girl, in Texas. The couple separated in 2006.

==Elizabeth Birch Equality Award==
Black Tie Dinner, the largest LGBT fund-raising dinner in the Nation, presents an annual award in Birch&#x27;s honor called the Elizabeth Birch Equality Award. The award is given annually to an individual, organization, or company that has made a significant contribution of national scope to the LGBT community. Elizabeth Birch was the first recipient of the award in 2004, and later returned to the dinner in 2009 to present the award to Judy Shepard. The Black Tie Dinner is held annually in Dallas, Texas.
