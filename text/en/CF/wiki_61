From early September to late October 2016, the ship underwent dry dock in Cadiz, Spain, where she was given many new dining, entertainment, and accommodation enhancements.

== History ==

Disney had cruise ship designs drawn up by February 1994. In 1995, Disney Cruise Line commissioned the construction of and &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; in Fincantieri, Italy. She was laid down on May 5, 1997, launched on February 23, 1998, and completed on June 18, 1999. The ship&#x27;s godmother was Disney character Tinkerbell (who only spoke with bell sounds), and Mickey Mouse (voiced by Wayne Allwine) gave the ship&#x27;s blessing in English. Wonder entered into service in August 1999.

&quot;Disney Wonder&quot; originally sailed three and four-night cruises to the Bahamas. In 2011, took over these itineraries. Since then, the &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; has been sailing a variety of itineraries that include stops in Alaska, the Mexican Riviera, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and passages through the Panama Canal.

Rebecca Coriam, a 24-year-old crew member, was last seen by one of &quot;Disney Wonder&quot;″s security cameras having an apparently upsetting telephone conversation in the early morning hours of March 22, 2011, before apparently disappearing the next day. It was the first such incident in the history of Disney Cruise Lines.

With the arrival of &quot;Disney Dream&quot; in 2011, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; was relocated to Los Angeles under a two-year contract with a three-year extension with the port.

On January 10, 2013, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; made her first-call ceremony in Miami, Florida. Cruises while stationed in Miami would consist of four- and five-night itineraries to the Bahamas and Western Caribbean with stops in Cozumel, Mexico; Disney&#x27;s private island, Castaway Cay; Grand Cayman; Key West and Nassau, Bahamas. The ship returned in April 2013 to Vancouver, British Columbia, for Alaskan cruises.

The ship was dry docked for an overhaul at the Navantia shipyard in Cadiz, Spain in September 2016 until October 23, 2016. &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; was then stationed out of Galveston, Texas starting November 10, 2016.

In October 2018, Disney Cruise Line began showing &quot;Disney at Sea with D23&quot;, a 30-minute entertainment news show that covers the many Disney subsidiaries with input from D23, starting with &quot;Disney Wonder&quot;.

A cruise in spring 2020 was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ship arrived at the Port of San Diego, California, on March 19, 2020, where 1,980 passengers disembarked; there were no reports that any had flu-like symptoms. By April 5, 38 crew members had reportedly tested positive to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, according to a report by Cruise Law News based on discussions with unnamed individuals on the ship. Disney, however, told other news media that none of the crew had tested positive. A passenger who disembarked at San Diego on March 20 reported that no health screening activities, such as the asking of health-related questions or the taking of temperatures, had occurred upon disembarkation, and that the only health screening that occurred was during the check-in process two weeks prior. After disembarking the passengers in March the ship was placed under a no-sail order, effective through July, by the Centers for Disease Control. As of May 2020 &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; and two other cruise ships were still at anchor offshore from San Diego. Approximately 700 crew were reportedly still aboard &quot;Disney Wonder&quot;.
After the resumption of cruising in October 2021, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; made sailing short cruises from San Diego, Galveston, and New Orleans, Louisiana, with a significantly reduced passenger load.

On March 31, 2022, the &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; made her inaugural trip to Avalon Catalina Island on a 4-night cruise, also stopping at Ensenada. This was celebrated in accordance with maritime tradition plaque exchanges.
In October 2023 &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; began a new itinerary from Australia sailing to out of Sydney to Auckland, Brisbane and Melbourne. She arrived in Sydney via Honolulu, Hawaii in October 2023 and will return to Vancouver in March 2024. She will then go back to San Diego, where she will offer 3-day and 4-day Baja, and 7-day Mexican Riviera cruises, then go back to Vancouver from San Diego for 7-day Alaskan round trips. Then she will travel back to Australia in October, and come back to Honolulu and Vancouver in February 2025.

== Recreation ==

=== Entertainment ===
Entertainment on &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; includes live Broadway-style shows (&quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;The Golden Mickeys&quot; and &quot;Disney Dreams&quot;) with many Disney characters at the Walt Disney Theater, the Buena Vista movie theater, which features both Disney films and first-run movies, several night clubs and lounges, several pools, and many Disney-themed parties and celebrations, including a Sail-Away Celebration, Pirate Night, Frozen Night (for Alaskan cruises) and sometimes a Marvel or Star Wars Day at Sea.

On the ship&#x27;s forward funnel, there is a 24-by-14 foot LED screen known as the &quot;Funnel Vision&quot;, due to its location on the rear of one of the ship&#x27;s funnels, where guests can watch various movies and shows either from the deck or from inside Goofy&#x27;s Pool.

=== Youth Activities ===
Children 3-10 can spend time at the Oceaneer Club and the Oceaneer Lab, which are connected by a passageway. The Club provides a slide, multiple TVs, dress up clothing, and counselor-led activities. The Lab provides video games, computers, cooking classes, and TV time geared towards the older end of that age bracket. Children receive an RFID badge when registered that allows the cruise staff to know the child&#x27;s location in the activity areas, and to help with Check-in and Checkout. Tweens ages 11–14 can enjoy the Edge on deck 9, where they can watch movies, play games, enjoy arts and crafts and more with other cruisers their age. Finally, the Vibe exists in the funnel on deck 11 for teens ages 14–17, where they can chill, hang out with friends, listen to music, watch TV, play group games, and more.

For adults, one of the ship&#x27;s three pools is reserved exclusively for older guests to relax and spend time, featuring a poolside bar and a number of deck chairs. There is also a shipboard spa at the front of the ship, past the adult pool, as well as a gym. There are also adults-only activities, including limited alcohol tastings, trivia, and other activities in the After Hours section of the ship, which becomes adults-only after 9pm.

The ship also has a promenade/walking track around the exterior on deck four. On some cruisings, there are fireworks at sea on one night of the cruise, as well as a Pirate Night and/or Star Wars/Marvel Day at Sea.

=== Dining ===
Disney Cruise line is known for pioneering the rotational dining setup, in which guests and their wait staff rotate through three differently themed restaurants throughout their cruise. The Disney Wonder&#x27;s restaurants include Triton&#x27;s (serving &quot;continental food with a french flair&quot;), Tiana&#x27;s Place (serving southern-, cajun-, and creole-inspired food), and Animator&#x27;s Palate (which is present on each of the original 4 Disney cruise ships). Additionally, the up-scale, adults-only restaurant Palo, situated at the rear of the ship, requires a separate reservation and serves high-end Italian cuisine.

<text>Bent Lorentzen (11 February 1935, Stenvad – 3 October 2018, Copenhagen) was a Danish composer. He was one of the outstanding figures in contemporary Danish music. His works are frequently performed at festivals at home and abroad, and he had established particularly close links with musical life in Poland and Germany. He was honoured with several international prizes and was named Choral Composer of the Year in Denmark in 1989 (Source: Edition·S – music¬sound¬art – Denmark).

== Life ==
Bent Lorentzen was born in Stenvad, a village on Djursland, East Jutland. He studied musicology at the university in Aarhus and at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. He was a pupil of Knud Jeppesen, Finn Høffding, Vagn Holmboe and Jørgen Jersild. After his final examination he taught at the Academies of Music in Aarhus and Copenhagen for several years. (Source: Bonde 2005)

Lorentzen was one of the earliest pioneers in the field of Danish electronic music (&quot;The Bottomless Pit&quot; in 1972 for the &quot;Nordic Music Days&quot; in Oslo, and &quot;Visions 1978&quot;), which was also introduced with an educational aim: the LP &quot;Elektronmusikkens materiale&quot; [The Material of Electronic Music, 1968] and the LP &quot;Water – electronic music for children&quot;, 1968. (Source: Bonde 2005)

Lorentzen&#x27;s orchestral music includes concertos for oboe (1980), cello (1984), piano (1984), saxophone (1986), trumpet (1991) and violin (2001); his chamber music comprises solo works for organ, piano, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, guitar, violin, cello and double-bass, as well as string quartets and works with mixed ensembles (2-12 instruments). He also composed numerous choral works in a unique dramatic style.
Lorentzen&#x27;s most important part of his works, however, are his operas and other works for the stage. His last opera &quot; Der Steppenwolf&quot; (Libretto after Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel by Michael Leinert) was first performed in Aarhus 2016 in a semi-concert version.

== Awards ==
Lorentzen held a number of important posts in different organisations in the Danish musical life, and he was the artistic director of the &quot;Ebeltoft Festival&quot; 1990-93. He was a prizewinner at several foreign competitions such as the &quot;Prix Italia&quot; in 1970 (for the opera &quot;Euridice&quot;), the &quot;Serocki composers’ competition&quot; in 1984 (for the chamber work &quot;Paradiesvogel&quot;), the &quot;International Competition for Choir Compositions&quot; in Austria 1987 (for &quot;Olof Palme),&quot; the &quot;Olivier Messiaen Organ Prize&quot; in 1988 (for &quot;Luna&quot;), &quot;Vienna Modern Masters&quot; in 1991 (for the &quot;Piano Concerto&quot;) and the &quot;Music and Poetry Prize&quot; in Belgium in 1989 (for Enzensberger’s &quot;Prozession&quot;). He was awarded ”&quot;Danish Choir Composer of the year&quot;” in 1990 and the &quot;Carl Nielsen Prize&quot; in 1995 and in 2003 the &quot;Wilhelm Hansen Composer Prize&quot;. Since 1982 and until his death, Lorentzen had received the lifelong grant of the Danish Art Council. (Source: Bonde 2005)

<doc id="959464" wikidata="Q3246606" url="?curid=959464" title="Marc Bulger">
<text>Marc Robert Bulger (; born April 5, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the St. Louis Rams. He played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers. Bulger was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft. He was also a member of the Atlanta Falcons and Baltimore Ravens, but played the entirety of his regular season career with the Rams.

==College career==
Bulger played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers. He was a sport management major.

===College statistics===

==Professional career==
===New Orleans Saints/Atlanta Falcons===
Bulger was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft, 168th overall, and spent training camp with the team before being waived. He was the fifth quarterback taken in the draft and one of the six taken before Tom Brady.

Bulger then spent two weeks on the practice squad of the Atlanta Falcons during the 2000 season.

===St. Louis Rams===
==== 2000-2001 ====
The St. Louis Rams signed Bulger to the practice squad late in the 2000 season. He was signed to the active roster by the Rams on January 12, 2001. As the third string quarterback, Bulger did not see any playing time during his first season with the Rams, as the team advanced to Super Bowl XXXVI.

==== 2002 ====
In 2002, after the Rams started 0–5, Bulger filled in for an injured Jamie Martin, who had been filling in for the injured Kurt Warner, who was the reigning league MVP. Bulger finished the season with a 6–0 record in games that he both started and finished, but he was injured early in a game against the Seattle Seahawks, and the Rams ended the season at 7–9 and missed the playoffs one year removed from their NFC Championship.

==== 2003 ====
Bulger entered the 2003 season as Warner&#x27;s backup, but was promoted to No. 1 on the depth chart after Warner committed five turnovers and suffered a concussion in an opening week loss to the New York Giants. Bulger then led the Rams to a regular-season record of 12–4, securing the NFC West title and a first-round bye. The Rams went on to lose a double-overtime thriller to the eventual NFC Champion Carolina Panthers in the divisional round of the playoffs. Bulger made the Pro Bowl where he was the game&#x27;s MVP.

==== 2004 ====

Bulger&#x27;s performance in 2003 solidified his position as the Rams&#x27; starting quarterback. Warner was released in June 2004, and the Rams signed Bulger to a four-year, $19.1 million contract. The Rams went 8–8 in 2004, narrowly losing the division to the heavily favored Seattle Seahawks, but earned a wild-card berth in a mediocre NFC.

The Rams defeated Seattle for a third time in the wild-card round, but lost the following week at the hands of the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round by a wide 17–47 margin.

==== 2005 ====
On October 17, against the Indianapolis Colts, Bulger injured his right shoulder. After missing two games, he returned to the field on November, 20 against the Arizona Cardinals where he re-injured his shoulder. He was then placed on IR on Christmas Day in 2005. He finished the 2005 season with 14 Touchdowns, 9 Interceptions and a 94.4 passer rating.

==== 2006 ====
On September 10, 2006, in a game against the Denver Broncos, Bulger reached 1,000 completions faster than any quarterback in NFL history. Bulger achieved this in 45 games, two games less than ex-Rams QB Kurt Warner. Drew Bledsoe and Peyton Manning needed 48 games, and it took Dan Marino 49.

==== 2007 ====
On July 28, 2007, Bulger signed a six-year, $62.5 million contract extension with the Rams, making him the highest-paid player in Rams history. The contract included $27 million in guaranteed money and put him in a group of six quarterbacks making $10 million a year or more. Bulger had one year remaining on a four-year, $19.1 million contract, which would have paid him $4 million in 2007. In the 2007 season, Bulger was plagued with injuries through the entire season as was the entire team. Injuries on the offensive line took effect as he threw more interceptions than touchdowns for the first time in his career. He was considered one of the biggest disappointments of the season, which saw the Rams slump to 3–13.

==== 2008 ====

On September 23, 2008, after starting 0–3, Bulger lost his starting role to Trent Green. However, seven days later, new head coach Jim Haslett named Marc Bulger the starting quarterback for the rest of the season.
On November 9, 2008, vs the Jets, Haslett replaced Bulger with Green after halftime after the Jets took a 40–0 lead in the first half, cued by four first half Rams turnovers.

A week later he was put back in as starting quarterback. His performances improved slightly as the year went on, but he still turned in another lackluster season with more interceptions than touchdowns and continuously declining completion percentages.

==== 2009 ====
Bulger was placed on season-ending injured reserve on December 26, 2009, as the Rams slumped to a franchise-worst 1–15 record, and a 6–42 record for the three seasons from 2007 to 2009. He had thrown just five touchdown passes during the 2009 season, although his statistics remained where they had been in 2007 and 2008, apart from an improved interception percentage of 2.4 percent vis-à-vis 4 percent.

Bulger asked for, and was granted, his release by the Rams on April 5, 2010, his 33rd birthday.

===Baltimore Ravens===
On June 23, 2010, Bulger reached an agreement with the Baltimore Ravens on a one-year, $3.8 million deal that also had the possibility of increasing to $5.8 million through incentives. However, Bulger spent the entire season backing up Joe Flacco and never played a single snap.

===Retirement===
Although several teams were interested in signing him, Bulger announced his retirement from football on August 2, 2011.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular Season===
==Personal life==
Bulger was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and graduated from Sacred Heart Middle School and Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh. He comes from a family of collegiate athletes. His father, Jim, was a quarterback for Notre Dame from 1970 to 1973. His brother Jim was on the Notre Dame golf team, sister Kate was selected into the WNBA, and youngest sister Meg was a standout guard for his alma mater, West Virginia. Bulger married Mavis Armbruster and has two daughters. His mother is of Irish descent. , he now lives in Brentwood, Tennessee.

<text>Pawiak () was a prison built in 1835 in Warsaw, Congress Poland.

During the January 1863 Uprising, it served as a transfer camp for Poles sentenced by Imperial Russia to deportation to Siberia.

During the World War II German occupation of Poland, it was used by the Germans, and in 1944 it was destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising.

==History==
Pawiak Prison took its name from that of the street on which it stood, &quot;ulica Pawia&quot; (Polish for &quot;Peacock Street&quot;).

Pawiak Prison was built in 1829–35 to the design of Enrico Marconi and Fryderyk Florian Skarbek, prison reformer, godfather to composer Frédéric Chopin, and ancestor of Krystyna Skarbek, the first woman to serve Britain as a special agent in the Second World War. During the 19th century, it was under tsarist control as Warsaw was part of the Russian Empire. During that time, it was the main prison of central Poland, where political prisoners and criminals alike were incarcerated.

During the January 1863 Uprising, the prison served as a transfer camp for Poles sentenced by Imperial Russia to deportation to Siberia.
After Poland regained independence in 1918, the Pawiak Prison became Warsaw&#x27;s main prison for male criminals. (Females were detained at the nearby Serbia Prison.)

Following the 1939 German invasion of Poland, the Pawiak Prison became a German &quot;Gestapo&quot; prison. Approximately 100,000 people were imprisoned during the prison&#x27;s operation, some 37,000 died on premises (executed, under torture, or during detention), and 60,000 were transferred to Nazi concentration camps. Large numbers of Jews passed through Pawiak and Serbia after the closure of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and during the first deportation in July to August 1942. Exact numbers are unknown, as the prison archives were never found.

During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Pawiak Prison became a German assault base. Pawiak jailers, commanded by Franz Bürkl, volunteered to hunt the Jews.

On 19 July 1944 a Ukrainian &quot;Wachmeister&quot; (guard) Petrenko and some prisoners attempted a mass jailbreak, supported by an attack from outside, but failed. Petrenko and several others committed suicide. The resistance attack detachment was ambushed and practically annihilated. The next day, in reprisal, the Germans executed over 380 prisoners. As Julien Hirshaut convincingly argues in &quot;Jewish Martyrs of Pawiak&quot;, it is inconceivable that the prison-escape attempt was a Gestapo-initiated provocation. The Polish underground had approved the plan but backed out without being able to alert those in the prison that the plan was cancelled.

The final transport of prisoners took place 30 July 1944, two days before the 1 August outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. Two thousand men and the remaining 400 women were sent to Gross-Rosen and Ravensbrück. Subsequently the Polish insurgents captured the area but lost it to German forces. On 21 August 1944 the Germans shot an unknown number of remaining prisoners and burned and blew up the buildings.

After World War II, the buildings were not rebuilt. Half of the gateway and three detention cells survive. Since 1990 a surviving basement has housed a museum which, with the Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom, forms the Museum of Independence.

<doc id="959478" wikidata="Q119973" url="?curid=959478" title="Pushyamitra Shunga">
<text>Pushyamitra Shunga (IAST: ) or Pushpamitra Shunga (IAST: ) (ruled ) was the founder and the first ruler of the Shunga Empire which he established to succeed the Maurya Empire. His original name was Puṣpaka or Puṣpamitra and the confusion between Puṣyamitra and Puṣpamitra arose because of the erroneous readings of &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; in the manuscripts. 

Pushyamitra is recorded to have performed the Ashvamedha ritual to legitimize his right to rule. Inscriptions of the Shungas have been found as far as the Ayodhya (the Dhanadeva–Ayodhya inscription), and the &quot;Divyavadana&quot; mentions that his empire stretched as far as Sakala (now Sialkot) in Punjab region, now in Pakistan.

Though Buddhist texts claim that Pushyamitra persecuted Buddhists; past and contemporary scholars have rejected these claims.

==Foundation of Shunga Empire==

Pushyamitra Shunga founded the Shunga Empire after assassinating the last Mauryan emperor Brihadratha Maurya. Subsequently, he drove out the Greeks with the Shunga–Greek War and ruled for 36 years.

The Buddhist text &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; names Pushyamitra as the last Mauryan emperor. This text appears to have confused Brihadratha with Pushyamitra.

H. C. Raychaudhuri theorized that the name &quot;Shunga&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word for the fig tree.

== Alleged persecution of Buddhists ==
=== Buddhist accounts ===
Buddhist texts claim that Pushyamitra cruelly persecuted the Buddhists. The earliest source to mention this is the 2nd Century CE text &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; (a part of &quot;Divyavadana&quot;). According to this account, Pushyamitra (described as the last Mauryan emperor) wanted to be famous. His ministers advised him that as long as Buddhism remained the dominant faith, he would never be as famous as his ancestor Ashoka, who had commissioned 84,000 stupas. One advisor told him that he could become famous by destroying Buddhism. Pushyamitra then tried to destroy the Kukkutarama monastery, but it was saved by chance. He then proceeded to Shakala in the north-west, where he offered a prize of one hundred &quot;Roman denarii&quot; (coins) for every head of a Buddhist monk brought to him. Next, he proceeded to the Koshthaka kingdom, where a Buddhist yaksha named Damshtranivasin killed him and his army with help of another yaksha named Krimisha.
Like other portions of the text, these accounts are regarded by many historians as being exaggerated.

&quot;Vibhasa&quot;, another 2nd century text, states that Pushyamitra burned Buddhist scriptures, killed Buddhist monks, and destroyed 500 monasteries in and around Kashmir. In this campaign, he was supported by yakshas, &quot;kumbhanda&quot;s, and other demons. However, when he reached the Bodhi tree, the deity of that tree took the form of a beautiful woman and killed him. &quot;Shariputrapariprichha&quot;, translated into Chinese between 317 and 420 CE also mentions this legend, but this particular version is more detailed, and describes eastern India (not Kashmir) as the center of Pushyamitra&#x27;s anti-Buddhist campaign.

The medieval-era &quot;Arya-Manjushri-Mula-Kalpa&quot; mentions a wicked and foolish king named Gomimukhya (&quot;cattle-faced&quot;), or Gomishanda (&quot;Gomin, the bull&quot;), who seized the territory from the east to Kashmir, destroying monasteries and killing monks. Ultimately, he and his officers were killed in the north by falling mountain rocks. This king is identified with Pushyamitra by Jayantanuja Bandyopadhyaya.

The 16th-century Tibetan Buddhist historian Taranatha also states that Pushyamitra and his allies killed Buddhist monks and destroyed monasteries from &quot;madhyadesha&quot; (midland) to Jalandhara. These activities wiped out the Buddhist doctrine from the north, within five years.

=== Authenticity of Buddhist claims ===

Based on Buddhist tradition, some scholars believe that Pushyamitra was indeed a persecutor of the Buddhist faith. However, others believe that Buddhist scholars were biased against Pushyamitra, because he did not patronize them.
According to archaeologist John Marshall, there is evidence of some damage to Buddhist establishments at Takshashila around the time of Shunga rule. He also theorized that the Sanchi stupa was vandalized in 2nd century BCE (that is, during Pushyamitra&#x27;s reign), before being rebuilt on a larger scale. G. R. Sharma, who excavated the Buddhist ruins at Kaushambi, suggested that the destruction of the local monastery might have happened during the reign of Pushyamitra Shunga. P. K. Mishra believes that the damage to the Deur Kothar stupa is also datable to Pushyamitra&#x27;s period. H. C. Raychaudhari pointed out that Buddhist monuments were constructed at Bharhut during the Shunga rule. However, according to N. N. Ghosh, these were constructed during the reign of later Shunga rulers, not Pushyamitra&#x27;s period.

H. Bhattacharya theorized that Pushyamitra might have persecuted Buddhists for political, rather than religious, reasons: the politically active Buddhists probably supported the Indo-Greek rivals of Pushyamitra, which might have prompted him to persecute them. The &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; states that Pushyamitra declared a reward for killing Buddhist monks in Shakala (present-day Sialkot), which was located near the Indo-Greek frontiers. According to K. P. Jayaswal, this further highlights a political motivation behind his alleged persecution of Buddhists.

Others have expressed skepticism about the Buddhist claims of persecution by Pushyamitra. Étienne Lamotte points out that the Buddhist legends are not consistent about the location of Pushyamitra&#x27;s anti-Buddhist campaign and his death. The &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; claims that Pushyamitra offered Roman &quot;dinara&quot;s as a reward for killing Buddhist monks, but the &quot;dinara&quot; did not come into general circulation in India before the 1st century BCE. &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; also claims that Ashoka persecuted &quot;Nirgrantha&quot;s (Ajivikas), which some assert is a fabrication, considering that Ashoka&#x27;s edicts express tolerance towards all religious sects. The Sri Lankan Buddhist text &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; suggests that several monasteries existed in present-day Bihar, Awadh and Malwa at the time Pushyamitra&#x27;s contemporary Dutthagamani ruled in Lanka. This suggests that these monasteries survived Pushyamitra Shunga&#x27;s reign.

H. C. Raychaudhury argued that Pushyamitra&#x27;s overthrow of the Mauryans cannot be considered as a Brahmin uprising against Buddhist rule, as Brahmins did not suffer during the Mauryan rule: Ashoka&#x27;s edicts mention the Brahmins before Shramanas, and the appointment of a Brahmin general (Pushyamitra) shows that the Brahmins were honoured at the Mauryan court. The fact that the &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; mentions Pushyamitra as a Mauryan further erodes its historical credibility, and weakens the hypothesis that he persecuted Buddhists because he was a Brahmin. Raychaudhury also argued that according to &quot;Malavikagnimitra&quot;, a Buddhist nun named Bhagavati Kaushiki attended Pushyamitra&#x27;s court, which indicates that they did not persecute Buddhists. However, Shankar Goyal states that there is no evidence of Kaushiki being a Buddhist nun. 

Historian Eric Seldeslachts states that there is &quot;no proof whatsoever that Pushyamitra actually persecuted the Buddhists&quot; though he may not have actively supported the Buddhists, invoking the Buddhist wrath.

Romila Thapar writes that the lack of concrete archaeological evidence casts doubt on the claims of Buddhist persecution by Pushyamitra.

It is possible that the Buddhist influence at the Mauryan court declined during Pushyamitra&#x27;s reign, and the Buddhist monasteries and other institutions stopped receiving royal patronage. This change might have led to discontent among the Buddhists, resulting in exaggerated accounts of persecution.

Michael Witzel states that &quot;Manu Smriti&quot;, which emphasizes the role of orthodox faith in state-craft and society, was first compiled under Pushyamitra&#x27;s rule. According to Kaushik Roy, it was a Brahmanical reaction to the rise of Buddhism and Jainism.

===Accounts against persecution===
Shunga emperors were seen as amenable to Buddhism and as having contributed to the building of the stupa at Bharhut. During his reign the Buddhist monuments of Bharhut and Sanchi were renovated and further improved. There is enough evidence to show that Pushyamitra patronised buddhist art.

== Succession of the throne ==
Pushyamitra Shunga was succeeded in 148 BCE by his son Agnimitra.

== In literature ==
Pushyamitra Shunga&#x27;s history is recorded in the Harshacharita authored by Bāṇabhaṭṭa.

According to &quot;Vicarasreni&quot; of Merutunga, Pushyamitra or Pushpamitra got his throne in 204 BC.

<text>Anier Octavio García Ortiz (born March 9, 1976) is a Cuban track and field athlete, winner of the 110 metres hurdles at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Born in Santiago de Cuba, Anier García established his credentials early, by winning the 1995 Pan American Junior Championships. In the next year, at the 1996 Summer Olympics, García was eliminated in the quarter-finals.

In 1997, García broke to the international scene by winning 60 m hurdles at the 1997 World Indoor Championships at Paris. At the World Championships in Athens, he competed with a leg injury, and although he finished second in his quarter-final, he withdrew from the semi-finals. In 1999, García won the Pan-American Games, but was beaten second by Colin Jackson at the World Championships.

The high peak of García&#x27;s career was at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The Olympic final was expected to be a tight competition amongst the top five hurdlers, but García won the gold medal easily, beating Terrence Trammell by 0.16 seconds. García repeated his silver medal at the 2001 World Championships and also won silver at the 2001 World Indoor Championships and 2003 World Indoor Championships. García did not compete at the 2003 World Championships due to a thigh injury, but at the 2004 Summer Olympics, he won the bronze medal.

==Personal bests==
==Achievements==

As of 20 November 2024, García holds twelve track records for the 110 metres hurdles set over the period 1996 to 2002. They include the track records for Hamburg (13.34), Melbourne (13.22) and Winnipeg (13.17).

<doc id="959488" wikidata="Q3067319" url="?curid=959488" title="Michiko Naruke">
<text>(born August 13, 1967) is a Japanese video game music composer, well known for her work in the &quot;Wild Arms&quot; series.

==Composing career==
She used to work for Telenet Japan and Riot, but many people who worked for these two companies left, and along with Naruke, later started working for Media.Vision. She has composed music for games outside of the &quot;Wild ARMs&quot; series, such as &quot;Psycho Dream&quot; on the Super Famicom and the Tenshi no Uta series on the PC Engine. While it was speculated that Naruke composed under the pseudonym &quot;Hassy&quot; for the @MIDI albums, the composer herself has stated that Hassy is a separate individual (Hiroya Hatsushiba).

She has made a number of songs for Media.Vision&#x27;s &quot;Wild ARMs&quot; series. Occasionally, the main theme and ending theme of the &quot;Wild ARMs&quot; songs will contain lyrics, formerly being sung by Machiko Watanabe and Kaori Asoh. Most recently, for the tenth anniversary, a new vocalist has been introduced, Nana Mizuki. Her compositions in the Wild ARMs series include her signature whistling parts, whistled by Naoki Takao. Naruke has composed more than 400 songs for the &quot;Wild ARMs&quot; series. However, during the development of &quot;Wild ARMs: The 4th Detonator&quot;, Naruke fell ill, marking the first time in the &quot;Wild ARMs&quot; series that she did not compose the entire soundtrack.

In an interview for &quot;Wild ARMs: Piece of Tears&quot;, Naruke revealed items which she values, including her keyboard and rhythm machine, a pamphlet of Jerry Goldsmith, a figure of Kurokishi from &quot;Gingaman&quot;, an original score of Bach, and a memorial vinyl disc.

<text>The Morris Ital is a medium-sized car that was built by British Leyland (BL) from 1980 to 1984. A successor to the Morris Marina, it was available in a variety of bodystyles.

==Design and launch==

The Ital was given the design code ADO73 F/L (because it was considered a facelift of the Series 2 Marina (ADO73) launched in 1976) and was first launched on 1 July 1980. It took its name from Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italdesign studio, which had been employed by BL to manage the re-engineering of the Morris Marina, which had been produced by the company since 1971. Although BL&#x27;s advertising emphasised the car&#x27;s connection with the Italian design house, Italdesign did not have a direct role in the styling of the new car, which had been handled in-house by Harris Mann. With a very limited budget to work with, Mann managed to give the car a more contemporary look through new door handles, prodigious use of plastic mouldings at the front, and very few sheet metal changes (all of the Ital&#x27;s front body panels are interchangeable with those of the Marina). Saloons gained a restyled boot lid and much larger rear tail lights. The estates were almost unchanged at the rear compared to their Marina predecessors.

Italdesign had been involved in a consultancy role, to help design new tooling and assembly methods, and work out how to integrate the altered parts of the new car into the existing Marina production chain. That is why, despite bearing the studio&#x27;s name, the Ital is absent from lists of styling jobs handled by the firm. It was originally planned to brand the car as the Morris Marina Ital but, for most markets, the Marina name was dropped on the orders of British Leyland CEO, Michael Edwardes, and only the Ital name was used.

The Ital had revised exterior styling, but retained the Marina&#x27;s 1.3- and 1.7-litre petrol engines and rear-wheel drive chassis. The dashboard and interior of the Marina were also carried over largely unaltered, including the main fascia panel, which faced &#x27;away&#x27; from the driver. The Marina&#x27;s coupé variant was not produced in Ital form, but the four door saloon, the five-door estate, and the pickup and van versions, were carried over from the Marina range. 

From October 1980 an automatic version of the Ital was available with the 2.0-litre O-Series power unit, as the range topping 2.0HLS. With a very short production run, only about 1,000 2.0HLS models were sold and the 2.0HLS remains the rarest Ital model. In November 1981, all HL and HLS models were fitted with upgraded interior trim.

In 1982 the Ital production line was moved from Cowley to Longbridge; this was to allow the former to be refitted for the upcoming start of production of the Austin Maestro, and the Ital&#x27;s ultimate replacement – the Austin Montego. Finally, in September of that year, a revised Ital range was introduced. The L and 2.0-litre models were dropped, and the HL and HLS were replaced by the SL and SLX models. Front suspension was changed to telescopic front dampers across the range, and parabolic rear springs were also fitted, together with additional soundproofing and improved trim. 

Thus cropped, the range then consisted of the 1.3 SL and SLX saloon, 1.3 SL estate, 1.7 SLX saloon, and the 1.7 SL saloon and estate. The saloon models were dropped in February 1984, with the estate models remaining in production until the summer of that year. 

During the 1970s British Leyland had been working on the development of an all-new car to replace the Morris Marina and the Ital was only ever intended as a stop gap replacement between the demise of the Marina and the launch of its replacement in the form of the Austin Montego, which did not happen until April 1984.

==Portuguese assembly==

Although most Itals were manufactured in the United Kingdom, there were also Portuguese assembled Itals which were all equipped with the ancient 1.5-litre B-series diesel engine, producing 37 hp. Portuguese Itals retained the &quot;Marina&quot; badge (actually &quot;Morris Marina 1.5 D&quot;) and were the only Marina/Itals to receive a diesel engine of any kind. 

The British Leyland factory in Setúbal (IMA) then switched to producing the Mini Moke.

==Sales==
The Ital sold reasonably well in Britain during the start of the 1980s, as it offered a competitive asking price and low running costs. The Ital&#x27;s technology differed from many of its contemporaries, such as the Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier, as well as the Talbot Alpine, which all used front wheel drive. It managed sales of 175,276 cars of all derivatives.

After the introduction of the Opel Ascona C / Vauxhall Cavalier Mark II in August 1981, the Ital and Ford&#x27;s Cortina (and later Sierra) were the only European mass volume cars in the sector to retain rear wheel drive.

==Demise of Morris==
The Ital was the last production car to wear the Morris badge, although there was a Morris badged van version of the Metro produced until 1984. Production of the Ital was switched from Cowley to Longbridge in September 1982 to allow the Cowley plant to be upgraded for production of the forthcoming Austin Montego and Austin Maestro. At this time, the Ital received an upgrade with different front and rear suspension (parabolic rear springs and telescopic front dampers) and models were redesignated SL and SLX. 

The saloon was dropped from the line in February 1984 with the van and estate completing outgoing contracts for another six months, until they too were axed. From this point, the Morris marque was kept alive solely by the Metro van, and three years later the Morris badge had finally been consigned to history after 75 years, when it was removed from the van version of the Metro. 

The Ital&#x27;s successor was the Austin Montego, launched in April 1984 as a four-door saloon, with a five-door estate arriving in October 1984, the van versions being succeeded by the van bodystyle of the Austin Maestro.

==Later production in China==
After production in the United Kingdom ceased, the Ital&#x27;s production tooling was sold to the Chengdu Auto Works, a company belonging to the First Auto Works Group in Sichuan, China. In 1998, the Ital estate (using a locally made chassis) reappeared there, under the name Huandu CAC6430 (Chinese: 环都). Van and pick up variants were also produced. Chengdu Auto Works is thought to have closed down in May 1999.

==Reputation==
Already outdated by the time it was launched, and continually saddled with build quality problems, the Ital soon gained a poor reputation. Although the Itals&#x27; reliability was never an issue, as it used tried and tested components, it was said to have similar rust problems to its predecessor, the Morris Marina. Despite being designated as a successor to the Marina, surviving Itals are actually rarer than Marinas today on UK roads, although the Morris Marina Owners Club and Morris Ital Register are making sure the few remaining examples survive. As the value of Morris Itals plummeted in the late 1980s and the 1990s, hundreds, possibly thousands, of functioning Itals were bought by Morris Minor owners. These were cannibalised for their 1275cc A+ engines, gearboxes, and suspensions. As of 2023, there are only 56 Morris Itals still taxed and on the roads in the UK, with another 133 Itals declared SORN (Statutory Off-Road Notice).

<text>Hypovolemic shock is a form of shock caused by severe hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume or extracellular fluid in the body). It can be caused by severe dehydration or blood loss. Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency; if left untreated, the insufficient blood flow can cause damage to organs, leading to multiple organ failure.

In treating hypovolemic shock, it is important to determine the cause of the underlying hypovolemia, which may be the result of bleeding or other fluid losses. To minimize ischemic damage to tissues, treatment involves quickly replacing lost blood or fluids, with consideration of both rate and the type of fluids used.

Tachycardia, a fast heart rate, is typically the first abnormal vital sign. When resulting from blood loss, trauma is the most common root cause, but severe blood loss can also happen in various body systems without clear traumatic injury. The body in hypovolemic shock prioritizes getting oxygen to the brain and heart, which reduces blood flow to nonvital organs and extremities, causing them to grow cold, look mottled, and exhibit delayed capillary refill. The lack of adequate oxygen delivery ultimately leads to a worsening increase in the acidity of the blood (acidosis). The &quot;lethal triad&quot; of ways trauma can lead to death is acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. It is possible for trauma to cause clotting problems even without resuscitation efforts.

Damage control resuscitation is based on three principles:
* permissive hypotension: tries to balance temporary suboptimal perfusion to organs with conditions for halting blood loss by setting a goal of 90 mmHg systolic blood pressure 
* hemostatic resuscitation: restoring blood volume in ways (with whole blood or equivalent) that interfere minimally with the natural process of stopping bleeding.
* damage control surgery.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of hypovolemic shock can be related to volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances, or acid–base disorders that accompany hypovolemic shock.

Patients with volume depletion may complain of thirst, muscle cramps, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Severe hypovolemic shock can result in mesenteric and coronary ischemia that can cause abdominal or chest pain. Agitation, lethargy, or confusion may characterize brain mal-perfusion.

Dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, low jugular venous distention, tachycardia, and hypotension can be seen along with decreased urinary output. Patients in shock can appear cold, clammy, and cyanotic.

Early signs and symptoms include tachycardia given rise to by catecholamine release; skin pallor due to vasoconstriction triggered by catecholamine release; hypotension followed by hypovolaemia and perhaps arising after myocardial insufficiency; and confusion, aggression, drowsiness and coma caused by cerebral hypoxia or acidosis. Tachypnoea owing to hypoxia and acidosis, general weakness caused by hypoxia and acidosis, thirst induced by hypovolaemia, and oliguria caused by reduced perfusion may also arise.

Abnormal growing central venous pressure indicates either hypotension or hypovolemia. Tachycardia accompanied by declined urine outflow implies either tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade or cardiac failure which is thought secondary to cardiac contusion or ischaemic heart disease. Echocardiography in such case may be helpful to distinguish cardiac failure from other diseases. Cardiac failure manifests a weak contractibility myocardium; treatment with an inotropic drug such as dobutamine may be appropriate.

==Cause==

The annual incidence of shock of any etiology is 0.3 to 0.7 per 1000, with hemorrhagic shock being most common in the intensive care unit. Hypovolemic shock is the most common type of shock in children, most commonly due to diarrheal illness in the developing world.

Hypovolemic shock occurs as a result of either blood loss or extracellular fluid loss.

===Blood loss===

Hemorrhagic shock is hypovolemic shock from blood loss. Traumatic injury is by far the most common cause of hemorrhagic shock, particularly blunt and penetrating trauma, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources, such as gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Other causes of hemorrhagic shock include bleed from an ectopic pregnancy, bleeding from surgical intervention, vaginal bleeding, and splenic rupture.

Obstetrical, vascular, iatrogenic, and even urological sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss to the point of hemodynamic compromise may occur in the chest, abdomen, or the retroperitoneum. The thigh itself can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood.

Localizing and controlling the source of bleeding is of utmost importance to the treatment of hemorrhagic shock.

The sequence of the most-commonly-seen causes that lead to hemorrhagic type of hypovolemic shock is given in order of frequencies: blunt or penetrating trauma including multiple fractures absent from vessel impairment, upper gastrointestinal bleeding e.g., variceal hemorrhage, peptic ulcer., or lower GI bleeding e.g., diverticular, and arteriovenous malformation.

Except for the two most common causes, the less common causes are intra-operative and post-operative bleeding, abdominal aortic rupture or left ventricle aneurysm rupture, aortic–enteric fistula, hemorrhagic pancreatitis, iatrogenic e.g., inadvertent biopsy of arteriovenous malformation, severed artery., tumors or abscess erosion into major vessels, post-partum hemorrhage, uterine or vaginal hemorrhage owing to infection, tumors, lacerations, spontaneous peritoneal hemorrhage caused by bleeding diathesis, and ruptured hematoma.

===Fluid loss===

In spite of hemorrhage, the amount of circulating blood in the body may drop as well when one loses excessive body fluid owing to non-hemorrhagic reasons.
Hypovolemic shock as a result of extracellular fluid loss can be of the 4 etiologies.

====Gastrointestinal====

Gastrointestinal (GI) losses can occur via many different etiologies. The gastrointestinal tract usually secretes between 3 and 6 liters of fluid per day. However, most of this fluid is reabsorbed as only 100 to 200 mL are lost in the stool. Volume depletion occurs when the fluid ordinarily secreted by the GI tract cannot be reabsorbed. This occurs when there is retractable vomiting, diarrhea, or external drainage via stoma or fistulas.

====Kidneys====

Renal losses of salt and fluid can lead to hypovolemic shock. The kidneys usually excrete sodium and water in a manner that matches sodium intake and water intake.

Diuretic therapy and osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia can lead to excessive renal sodium and volume loss. In addition, there are several tubular and interstitial diseases beyond the scope of this article that cause severe salt-wasting nephropathy.

====Skin====

Fluid loss also can occur from the skin. In a hot and dry climate, skin fluid losses can be as high as 1 to 2 liters/hour. Patients with a skin barrier interrupted by burns or other skin lesions also can experience large fluid losses that lead to hypovolemic shock.

====Third-spacing====

Sequestration of fluid into a third space also can lead to volume loss and hypovolemic shock. Third-spacing of fluid can occur in intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, obstruction of a major venous system, vascular endothelium or any other pathological condition that results in a massive inflammatory response.

==Pathophysiology==

===Blood loss===

Hemorrhagic shock is due to the depletion of intravascular volume through blood loss to the point of being unable to match the tissues&#x27; demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria are no longer able to sustain aerobic metabolism for the production of oxygen and switch to the less efficient anaerobic metabolism to meet the cellular demand for adenosine triphosphate. In the latter process, pyruvate is produced and converted to lactic acid to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to maintain some degree of cellular respiration in the absence of oxygen.

The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. Typically, there is a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure with narrowing of the pulse pressure. As diastolic ventricular filling continues to decline and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure drops.

Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is diverted away from noncritical organs and tissues to preserve blood supply to vital organs such as the heart and brain. While prolonging heart and brain function, this also leads to other tissues being further deprived of oxygen causing more lactic acid production and worsening acidosis. This worsening acidosis along with hypoxemia, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction, worsening hemodynamic compromise, and death.

The body&#x27;s compensation varies by cardiopulmonary comorbidities, age, and vasoactive medications. Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely variable and, therefore, cannot be relied upon as the sole means of diagnosis.

A key factor in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic shock is the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Coagulopathy develops as a combination of several processes. The simultaneous loss of coagulation factors via hemorrhage, hemodilution with resuscitation fluids, and coagulation cascade dysfunction secondary to acidosis and hypothermia have been traditionally thought to be the cause of coagulopathy in trauma. However, this traditional model of trauma-induced coagulopathy may be too limited. Further studies have shown that a degree of coagulopathy begins in 25% to 56% of patients before initiation of the resuscitation. This has led to the recognition of trauma-induced coagulopathy as the sum of two distinct processes: &quot;acute coagulopathy of trauma&quot; and &quot;resuscitation-induced coagulopathy&quot;.

Trauma-induced coagulopathy is acutely worsened by the presence of acidosis and hypothermia. The activity of coagulation factors, fibrinogen depletion, and platelet quantity are all adversely affected by acidosis. Hypothermia (less than 34 C) compounds coagulopathy by impairing coagulation and is an independent risk factor for death in hemorrhagic shock.

===Fluid loss===

Hypovolemic shock results from depletion of intravascular volume, whether by extracellular fluid loss or blood loss. The body compensates with increased sympathetic tone resulting in increased heart rate, increased cardiac contractility, and peripheral vasoconstriction. The first changes in vital signs seen in hypovolemic shock include an increase in diastolic blood pressure with narrowed pulse pressure.

As volume status continues to decrease, systolic blood pressure drops. As a result, oxygen delivery to vital organs is unable to meet the oxygen needs of the cells. Cells switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism, resulting in lactic acidosis. As sympathetic drive increases, blood flow is diverted from other organs to preserve blood flow to the heart and brain. This propagates tissue ischemia and worsens lactic acidosis. If not corrected, there will be worsening hemodynamic compromise and, eventually, death.

==Diagnosis==

Shock index (SI) has been defined as ; SI≥0.6 is a clinical shock.

Such ratio value is clinically employed to determine the scope or emergence of shock. The SI correlates with the extent of hypovolemia and thus may facilitate the early identification of severely injured patients threatened by complications due to blood loss and therefore need urgent treatment, i.e. blood transfusion.

Data presented as n (%), mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range (IQR)). n = 21,853; P &lt;0.001 for all parameters. ED Emergency department, GCS Glasgow coma scale, HR Heart rate, SBP Systolic blood pressure, SI = Shock index.

===Bleeding===

Recognizing the degree of blood loss via vital sign and mental status abnormalities is important. The American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) hemorrhagic shock classification links the amount of blood loss to expected physiologic responses in a healthy 70 kg patient. As total circulating blood volume accounts for approximately 7% of total body weight, this equals approximately five liters in the average 70 kg male patient.
* Class 1: Volume loss up to 15% of total blood volume, approximately 750 mL. Heart rate is minimally elevated or normal. Typically, there is no change in blood pressure, pulse pressure, or respiratory rate.
* Class 2: Volume loss from 15% to 30% of total blood volume, from 750 mL to 1500 mL. Heart rate and respiratory rate become elevated (100 BPM to 120 BPM, 20 RR to 24 RR). Pulse pressure begins to narrow, but systolic blood pressure may be unchanged to slightly decreased.
* Class 3: Volume loss from 30% to 40% of total blood volume, from 1500 mL to 2000 mL. A significant drop in blood pressure and changes in mental status occur. Heart rate and respiratory rate are significantly elevated (more than 120 BPM). Urine output declines. Capillary refill is delayed.
* Class 4: Volume loss over 40% of total blood volume. Hypotension with narrow pulse pressure (less than 25 mmHg). Tachycardia becomes more pronounced (more than 120 BPM), and mental status becomes increasingly altered. Urine output is minimal or absent. Capillary refill is delayed.

Again, the above is outlined for a healthy 70 kg individual. Clinical factors must be taken into account when assessing patients. For example, elderly patients taking beta blockers can alter the patient&#x27;s physiologic response to decreased blood volume by inhibiting mechanism to increase heart rate. As another, patients with baseline hypertension may be functionally hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg.

===Non-bleeding===

Various laboratory values can be abnormal in hypovolemic shock. Patients can have increased BUN and serum creatinine as a result of pre-renal kidney failure. Hypernatremia or hyponatremia can result, as can hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.

Lactic acidosis can result from increased anaerobic metabolism. However, the effect of acid–base balance can be variable as patients with large GI losses can become alkalotic.

In cases of hemorrhagic shock, hematocrit and hemoglobin can be severely decreased. However, with a reduction in plasma volume, hematocrit and hemoglobin can be increased due to hemoconcentration.

Low urinary sodium is commonly found in hypovolemic patients as the kidneys attempt to conserve sodium and water to expand the extracellular volume. However, sodium urine can be low in a euvolemic patient with heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome. Fractional excretion of sodium under 1% is also suggestive of volume depletion. Elevated urine osmolality can also suggest hypovolemia. However, this number also can be elevated in the setting of impaired concentrating ability by the kidneys.

Central venous pressure (CVP) is often used to assess volume status. However, its usefulness in determining volume responsiveness has recently come into question. Ventilator settings, chest wall compliance, and right-sided heart failure can compromise CVPs accuracy as a measure of volume status. Measurements of pulse pressure variation via various commercial devices has also been postulated as a measure of volume responsiveness. However, pulse pressure variation as a measure of fluid responsiveness is only valid in patients without spontaneous breaths or arrhythmias. The accuracy of pulse pressure variation also can be compromised in right heart failure, decreased lung or chest wall compliance, and high respiratory rates.

Similar to examining pulse pressure variation, measuring respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter as a measure of volume responsiveness has only been validated in patients without spontaneous breaths or arrhythmias.

Measuring the effect of passive leg raises on cardiac contractility by echo appears to be the most accurate measurement of volume responsiveness, although it is also subject to limitations.

History and physical can often make the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock. For patients with hemorrhagic shock, a history of trauma or recent surgery is present. For hypovolemic shock due to fluid losses, history and physical should attempt to identify possible GI, renal, skin, or third-spacing as a cause of extracellular fluid loss.

Although relatively nonsensitive and nonspecific, physical exam can be helpful in determining the presence of hypovolemic shock. Physical findings suggestive of volume depletion include dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and low jugular venous distention. Tachycardia and hypotension can be seen along with decreased urinary output.

===Differential diagnosis===

While hemorrhage is the most common cause of shock in the trauma patient, other causes of shock are to remain on the differential. Obstructive shock can occur in the setting of tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade. These etiologies should be uncovered in the primary survey. In the setting of head or neck trauma, an inadequate sympathetic response, or neurogenic shock, is a type of distributive shock that is caused by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. This is suggested by an inappropriately low heart rate in the setting of hypotension. Cardiac contusion and infarctions can result in cardiogenic shock. Finally, other causes should be considered that are not related to trauma or blood loss. In the undifferentiated patient with shock, septic shock and toxic causes are also on the differential.

==Management==

The first step in managing hemorrhagic shock is recognition. Ideally, This should occur before the development of hypotension. Close attention should be paid to physiological responses to low-blood volume. Tachycardia, tachypnea, and narrowing pulse pressure may be the initial signs. Cool extremities and delayed capillary refill are signs of peripheral vasoconstriction.

===Bleeding===

In the setting of trauma, an algorithmic approach via the primary and secondary surveys is suggested by ATLS. Physical exam and radiological evaluations can help localize sources of bleeding. A trauma ultrasound, or Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST), has been incorporated in many circumstances into the initial surveys. The specificity of a FAST scan has been reported above 99%, but a negative ultrasound does not rule out intra-abdominal pathology.

With a broader understanding of the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic shock, treatment in trauma has expanded from a simple massive transfusion method to a more comprehensive management strategy of &quot;damage control resuscitation&quot;. The concept of damage control resuscitation focuses on permissive hypotension, hemostatic resuscitation, and hemorrhage control to adequately treat the &quot;lethal triad&quot; of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia that occurs in trauma.

Hypotensive resuscitation has been suggested for the hemorrhagic shock patient without head trauma. The aim is to achieve a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg in order to maintain tissue perfusion without inducing re-bleeding from recently clotted vessels. Permissive hypotension is a means of restricting fluid administration until hemorrhage is controlled while accepting a short period of suboptimal end-organ perfusion. Studies regarding permissive hypotension have yielded conflicting results and must take into account type of injury (penetrating versus blunt), the likelihood of intracranial injury, the severity of the injury, as well as proximity to a trauma center and definitive hemorrhage control.

The quantity, type of fluids to be used, and endpoints of resuscitation remain topics of much study and debate. For crystalloid resuscitation, normal saline and lactated ringers are the most commonly used fluids. Normal saline has the drawback of causing a non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to the high chloride content, while lactated ringers can cause a metabolic alkalosis as lactate metabolism regenerates into bicarbonate.

Recent trends in damage control resuscitation focus on &quot;hemostatic resuscitation&quot; which pushes for early use of blood products rather than an abundance of crystalloids in order to minimize the metabolic derangement, resuscitation-induced coagulopathy, and the hemodilution that occurs with crystalloid resuscitation. The end goal of resuscitation and the ratios of blood products remain at the center of much study and debate. A recent study has shown no significant difference in mortality at 24 hours or 30 days between ratios of 1:1:1 and 1:1:2 of plasma to platelets to packed RBCs. However, patients that received the more balanced ratio of 1:1:1 were less likely to die as a result of exsanguination in 24 hours and were more likely to achieve hemostasis. Additionally, reduction in time to first plasma transfusion has shown a significant reduction in mortality in damage control resuscitation.

In addition to blood products, products that prevent the breakdown of fibrin in clots, or antifibrinolytics, have been studied for their utility in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock in the trauma patient. Several antifibrinolytics have been shown to be safe and effective in elective surgery. The CRASH-2 study was a randomized control trial of tranexamic acid versus placebo in trauma has been shown to decrease overall mortality when given in the first three hours of injury. Follow-up analysis shows additional benefit to tranexamic acid when given in the first three hours after surgery.

Damage control resuscitation is to occur in conjunction with prompt intervention to control the source of bleeding. Strategies may differ depending on proximity to definitive treatment.

For patients in hemorrhagic shock, early use of blood products over crystalloid resuscitation results in better outcomes. Balanced transfusion using 1:1:1 or 1:1:2 of plasma to platelets to packed red blood cells results in better hemostasis. Anti-fibrinolytic administration to patients with severe bleed within 3 hours of traumatic injury appears to decrease death from major bleed as shown in the CRASH-2 trial. Research on oxygen-carrying substitutes as an alternative to packed red blood cells is ongoing, although no blood substitutes have been approved for use in the United States.

===Fluid loss===

For patients in hypovolemic shock due to fluid losses, the exact fluid deficit cannot be determined. Therefore, it is prudent to start with 2 liters of isotonic crystalloid solution infused rapidly as an attempt to quickly restore tissue perfusion. Fluid repletion can be monitored by measuring blood pressure, urine output, mental status, and peripheral edema. Multiple modalities exist for measuring fluid responsiveness such as ultrasound, central venous pressure monitoring, and pulse pressure fluctuation as described above. Vasopressors may be used if blood pressure does not improve with fluids.

Crystalloid fluid resuscitation is preferred over colloid solutions for severe volume depletion not due to bleeding. The type of crystalloid used to resuscitate the patient can be individualized based on the patients&#x27; chemistries, estimated volume of resuscitation, acid/base status, and physician or institutional preferences.

Isotonic saline is hyperchloremic relative to blood plasma, and resuscitation with large amounts can lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Several other isotonic fluids with lower chloride concentrations exist, such as lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution or PlasmaLyte. These solutions are often referred to as buffered or balanced crystalloids. Some evidence suggests that patients who need large volume resuscitation may have a less renal injury with restrictive chloride strategies and use of balanced crystalloids. Crystalloid solutions are equally as effective and much less expensive than colloid. Commonly used colloid solutions include those containing albumin or hyperoncotic starch. Studies examining albumin solutions for resuscitation have not shown improved outcomes, while other studies have shown resuscitation with hyper-oncotic starch leads to increased mortality rate and renal failure. Patients in shock can appear cold, clammy, and cyanotic.

Hypothermia increases the mortality rate of patients with hypovolemic shock. It is advised to keep the patient warm for the sake of maintaining the temperatures of all kinds of fluids inside the patient.

===Monitoring parameters===
* Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2).
* Respiratory rate.
* Pulse rate.
* Arterial blood pressure.
* Pulse pressure.
* Central venous pressure.
* Urine output.
* Base deficit and/or lactic acid.
* Temperature.
* Mental state.
* Changes in the electrocardiogram.

==Prognosis==

If the vital organs are deprived of perfusion for more than just a short time, the prognosis is generally not good. Shock is still a medical emergency characterized by a high mortality rate. Early identification of patients who are likely to succumb to their illness is of utmost importance.

==Epidemiology==

===Blood loss===

Trauma remains a leading cause of death worldwide with approximately half of these attributed to hemorrhage. In the United States in 2001, trauma was the third leading cause of death overall, and the leading cause of death in those aged 1 to 44 years. While trauma spans all demographics, it disproportionately affects the young with 40% of injuries occurring in ages 20 to 39 years by one country&#x27;s account. Of this 40%, the greatest incidence was in the 20 to 24-year-old range.

The preponderance of hemorrhagic shock cases resulting from trauma is high. During one year, one trauma center reported 62.2% of massive transfusions occur in the setting of trauma. The remaining cases are divided among cardiovascular surgery, critical care, cardiology, obstetrics, and general surgery, with trauma utilizing over 75% of the blood products.

As patients age, physiological reserves decrease the likelihood of anticoagulant use increases and the number of comorbidities increases. Due to this, elderly patients are less likely to handle the physiological stresses of hemorrhagic shock and may decompensate more quickly.

===Fluid loss===

While the incidence of hypovolemic shock from extracellular fluid loss is difficult to quantify, it is known that hemorrhagic shock is most commonly due to trauma. In one study, 62.2% of massive transfusions at a level 1 trauma center were due to traumatic injury. In this study, 75% of the blood products used were related to traumatic injury. Elderly patients are more likely to experience hypovolemic shock due to fluid losses as they have less physiologic reserve.

Hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea and/or dehydration is thought to be predominant in low-income countries.

<doc id="959492" wikidata="Q2655800" url="?curid=959492" title="Kenji Ito">
<text>, also known by the nickname , is a Japanese video game composer and musician. He is best known for his work on the &quot;Mana&quot; and &quot;SaGa&quot; series, though he has worked on over 30 video games throughout his career as well as composed or arranged music for over 15 other albums, concerts, and plays. He learned to play several instruments at a young age, and joined Square directly out of college as a composer in 1990 at the advice of a professor. He worked there for over a decade, composing many of his best-known scores. In 2001, he left Square to become a freelance composer, but has since continued to collaborate with the company.

Since leaving Square, Ito has composed soundtracks to over a dozen games, and has branched out into composition and production of music for plays and albums for other performers. Ito&#x27;s work has been performed in a concert dedicated to his pieces as well as general video game music events, and he has played the piano in additional concerts. Pieces of his from the &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Mana&quot; series have been arranged as piano solos and published in sheet music books.

===Early life===
Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became interested in music at the age of four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming interested in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.

===Career===
His first project was a co-effort that same year between himself and Nobuo Uematsu for the Game Boy title &quot;Final Fantasy Legend II&quot; (&quot;SaGa 2&quot;). It led the following year to the first album release of his music, &quot;All Sounds of SaGa&quot;, which was a combination album of &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Legend II&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot;; all of Ito&#x27;s work on &quot;Legend II&quot; appeared on the album. Shortly after in 1991, he composed his first solo work, the soundtrack for &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; (&quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot;), another Game Boy title. He then returned to the &quot;SaGa&quot; series for the next few years, composing the soundtracks to the Super Famicom&#x27;s &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;, &quot;Romancing SaGa 2&quot;, and &quot;Romancing SaGa 3&quot;. These soundtracks sparked Ito&#x27;s first arranged albums; the first game was arranged in a French musical style by Masaaki Mizuguchi, while the other two were arranged by Ryou Fukui and Taro Iwashiro, respectively, into orchestral pieces. Ito was originally scheduled to continue on with the &quot;Mana&quot; series and compose the soundtrack to &quot;Seiken Densetsu 2&quot; (&quot;Secret of Mana&quot;), but was forced to hand the project off to Hiroki Kikuta as his first score due to the demand on his time for scoring &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;.

1995 marked the first time since he started composing that he worked on a title outside the &quot;Mana&quot; or &quot;SaGa&quot; series; he composed the music for &quot;Koi wa Balance&quot; and was a member of an eight-person team for &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;. He returned to the &quot;SaGa&quot; series in 1997 with &quot;SaGa Frontier&quot;, and finished out the decade with &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; and &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon 2&quot;; for &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; he only arranged previous works from the &quot;Chocobo&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, and contributed only a few tracks to &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon 2&quot;. He left Square in 2001 to become a freelance composer. He has said that this move was in order to give him the flexibility to work on more than just video game music.

The first work that Ito composed after leaving Square was the soundtrack to &quot;Culdcept II&quot;, which he regards as his best work. He attributes this feeling both to the fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the &quot;Mana&quot; series with the remake of his second soundtrack, &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, into the soundtrack of &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;, &quot;Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song&quot;. He has since returned to the &quot;Mana&quot; series twice, with the soundtracks to &quot;Children of Mana&quot; and &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot;. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for &quot;Cross Gate&quot; in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hero Must Die&quot;, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.

==Legacy==
Ito performed piano live during September 22, 2006 &quot;Press Start 2006 -Symphony of Games-&quot; live concert, at which several of his pieces were performed by an orchestra. This concert followed a concert of August 26, 2006 &quot;Manami Kiyota x Kenji Ito Collaboration Live&quot; in which he played the piano for songs composed by him for the event and sung by Manami Kiyota; he has also played the piano at concerts given by &quot;The Black Mages&quot;, a band composed of current or former Square musicians, before they expanded to include a full-time pianist. Music composed by Ito has also been performed at the &quot;Extra -Hyper Game Music Event 2007&quot; and &quot;Christmas Live 2008 &quot;gentleecho -prelude-&quot;&quot; concerts.

Music composed by Ito was performed at a concert devoted to his music on February 21, 2009 titled &quot;gentle echo meeting&quot; at the Uchisaiwaicho Hall in Chiyoda, Tokyo. A group of five musicians performed eight of his songs, interspersed with performances by Ito and discussions about his music between himself and Masahiro Sakurai. The event began as a concert due to Ito&#x27;s wish to host one based on his music, but after the space the organizing company, Harmonics International, rented turned out to be run by a high school classmate of Ito, at the classmate&#x27;s insistence the discussions of Ito&#x27;s music were added to the program.

Music from the original soundtracks of &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; and &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Two compilation books of music from the series as a whole have also been published as &quot;Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music&quot; first and second editions, with the first edition including tracks by Ito from &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; while the second added tracks he composed from &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot;. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. Additionally, KMP Music Publishing has published a book of the piano music included in the &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; soundtrack album, which Ito arranged from his original compositions. DOREMI Music Publishing also published music from the original soundtracks of some of the &quot;SaGa&quot; games that Ito composed as piano sheet music book; music from &quot;Romancing SaGa 3&quot;, &quot;Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song&quot;, and &quot;SaGa Frontier&quot; were written by Asako Niwa for piano solos of beginning to intermediate difficulty.

==Musical style and influences==
Ito&#x27;s music is mainly inspired by images from the game rather than outside influences; however, he never played the games themselves. The only video games that he plays are sports games; he has only seen up to the introductory movie for most of the role-playing games that he has written music for. While many of his pieces are orchestral, he enjoys working in a recording studio and enjoys composing &quot;normal songs&quot; as much as his orchestral works. His favorite video game music from other composers include the music from &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot;. Non-video game music that has inspired him includes Japanese popular music and soundtracks to anime works, as well as easy listening music such as Paul Mauriat or Richard Clayderman, especially string music. These influences have led him to wish to create music &quot;that you can listen to while you relax&quot;. He also wishes to expand his compositions outside video game music and into ballads.

<doc id="959504" wikidata="Q3569425" url="?curid=959504" title="The Wipers Times">
<text>The Wipers Times was a trench magazine that was published by British soldiers fighting in the Ypres Salient during the First World War.

In early 1916, the 12th Battalion, Sherwood Foresters stationed in the front line at Ypres, Belgium, came across an abandoned printing press. A sergeant who had been a printer in peacetime salvaged it and printed a sample page. The paper itself was named after Tommy slang pronunciation of Ypres.

==Publication history==
Under its initial title &quot;The Wipers Times and Salient News&quot;, the first issue was published on 12 February 1916, with a circulation of one hundred copies. It was followed by another 22 issues, mostly consisting of 12 pages each.

While the size and the layout of the magazine remained consistent, its main title changed many times. Previous titles remained listed in the subtitle in chronological order, for instance: &quot;The B.E.F. Times: with which are incorporated The Wipers Times, The &quot;New Church&quot; Times, The Kemmel Times &amp; The Somme-Times&quot;. Every main title change initiates a new volume and issue sequence and as result, there are several instances of &#x27;volume 1, number 1&#x27;.

Publication was held up after February 1918 by the German offensive on the western front in that year, but at the end of the War, two issues were published as &quot;The Better Times&quot;. The second of these was billed as the &quot;Xmas, Peace and Final Number&quot;.

==Personnel==
The names of the staff involved in the paper are mostly unrecorded. The editor was Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Frederick John Roberts, MC, the sub-editor was Lieutenant (later Lieutenant-Colonel) John Hesketh (&quot;Jack&quot;) Pearson, DSO, MC. A notable contributor to the paper was the Gunner Gilbert Frankau. Also worthy of note are the engravings by E. J. Couzens; his portrait of a chinless platoon commander clutching his cane and wondering &quot;Am I as offensive as I might be?&quot; became the paper&#x27;s motif. Most other contributors from the Division used pseudonyms, some now obscure, some intended to satirise contemporary newspaper pundits such as William Beach Thomas (of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;) and Hilaire Belloc and some ironic, such as P.B.I. (Poor Bloody Infantry).

==Contents==
The paper consisted of poems, reflections, wry in-jokes and lampoons of the military situation the Division was in. In general the paper maintained a humorously ironic style that today can be recognised in satirical magazines such as &quot;The Duffel Blog&quot;, &quot;Private Eye&quot;, &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; and &quot;The Onion&quot;.

===Adverts===
The covers of the issues were mostly mock adverts, richly typeset, often for war-related music-hall extravaganzas. Similar adverts appeared on the back and front inside covers:
There were also sales offers for pleasant stays at unlikely locations like the city ramparts, for weapons like the &quot;flammenwerfer&quot; (flamethrower) and even for the complete Ypres Salient front line:
===Vocabulary===
The daily concerns of trench soldiers all make an appearance in the articles, sometimes explicit and sometimes as in-jokes for which outsiders would not have the key.

Shelling (whether from the enemy or one&#x27;s own side): is referred to all through the magazine. There are occasional small ads purportedly from Minnie (German trench mortar) to Flying Pig (British ditto) and various poems complaining about, or apologising for, incidents where British guns shelled their own lines.

Sex: the collections of pornography known to the Division as &quot;The Munque Art Gallery&quot; and &quot;Kirschner&#x27;s&quot; are frequently mentioned and occasionally advertised, as are the local brothels: the Fancies, the Poplar tree and Plug Street.

Drink: the continued supply of rum and whisky was a prime concern for all at the front. In one serial story, &quot;Narpoo Rum,&quot; a certain &#x27;Herlock Shomes&#x27; spent five issues tracking rum-thieves round Hooge. Brief references also turn up to panic buying of supplies by unnamed individuals in the Division after rumours of a whisky drought.

Rats: these bred in enormous numbers in the trenches, chiefly fed on corpses but with an eye for anything left in a dugout. One poem in the paper describes how a rat and his wife opened a tin of sardines, ate the contents then sealed the tin back up for the author to find.

===Articles===
The reality of life in the trenches rarely breaks through what the editor termed the paper&#x27;s &#x27;hysterical hilarity&#x27; but when it does, the gallows humour is clear and may appear callous to modern eyes. One example is a quote from an article in a British national newspaper about a bungled trench-raid, followed by a sharp comment from the editor of the &quot;Wipers Times&quot;:

&quot;...They climbed into the trench and surprised the sentry, but unfortunately the revolver which was held to his head missed fire. Attempts were made to throttle him quietly, but he succeeded in raising the alarm, and had to be killed.&quot;

This we consider real bad luck for the sentry after the previous heroic efforts to keep him alive.
Another such, from the column &quot;Verbatim Extracts from Intelligence Summaries&quot; reads as follows:
&quot;At 10 p.m. the &quot;Flying Pig&quot; dropped a round in our front line at X 9 D 5 2. The trench was completely wrecked—the crater formed being 14 feet deep and 25 feet across. It is consoling to think that over 40 rounds have been fired from this gun into the enemy trenches during the last week.&quot;

(Very consoling to the P.B.I.)

Even the weather wasn&#x27;t immune to it, if you wanted to lay odds on the forecasts:
5 to 1 Mist
11 to 2 East Wind or Frost
8 to 1 Chlorine.

===Poetry===
Much of the copy submitted by soldiers of the Division was poetry. Some was good, some was doggerel and occasional pieces were excellent: but not all was welcome. The fourth issue contained this notice from the editor:

We regret to announce that an insidious disease is affecting the Division, and the result is a hurricane of poetry. Subalterns have been seen with a notebook in one hand, and bombs in the other absently walking near the wire in deep communication with their muse. Even Quartermasters with &quot;books, note, one&quot; and &quot;pencil, copying&quot; break into song while arguing the point re &quot;boots. gum, thigh&quot;.

The Editor would be obliged if a few of the poets would break into prose as the paper cannot live by poems alone.

Nonetheless, much of the space in the paper was taken up by poems. Two typical examples are given below.

&lt;poem&gt;Realizing Men must laugh,
Some Wise Man devised the Staff :
Dressed them up in little dabs
Of rich variegated tabs :
Taught them how to win the War
On A.F.Z. 354 :
Let them lead the Simple Life
Far from all our vulgar strife :
Nightly gave them downy beds
For their weary, aching heads :
Lest their relatives might grieve
Often, often gave them leave,
Decorations too, galore :
What on earth could man wish more?
Yet, alas, or so says Rumour,
He forgot a sense of Humour!

The world wasn&#x27;t made in a day,
And Eve didn&#x27;t ride on a bus,
But most of the world&#x27;s in a sandbag,
The rest of its plastered on us.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Miscellanea===
The paper is sprinkled with small paragraphs and half-column articles such as &quot;People We Take Our Hats Off To&quot; (frequently the French), &quot;Things We Want to Know&quot;, &quot;Answers to Correspondents&quot; and small ads. Some were obviously spoofs:

LONELY PRESIDENT wishes correspond with anyone.
Can write charming note.
Has corresponded with most of the crowned heads of Europe.-
Write &quot;Dignitas,&quot;Washington, U.S.A.

To Subaltern: Yes, every junior officer may carry a F.M.&#x27;s baton in his knapsack, but we think you&#x27;ll discard that to make room for an extra pair of socks before very long.

TO LET-;Fine freehold estate in salubrious neighbourhood. Terms moderate. Owner going east shortly.-;Apply Bosch and Co., Messines.

While others were not for outsiders:

Things We Want To Know

The name of the celebrated infantry officer who appears daily in the trenches disguised as a Xmas tree.

How much money changed hands when it was known that he didn&#x27;t get married on leave.

Whether a certain officer is shortly publishing a little song entitled &quot;Why was I so careless with the boots.&quot;

To Troubled.-;Certainly think you have just complaint against people in the next dugout, and if you care to take the matter further there is no doubt you will get damages. It certainly was scandal if, as you affirm, the picture was one of Kirschner&#x27;s.

We regret a further rise in property today.

==Published editions==

===Original issues===
There appear to be few surviving copies of original issues. This is not surprising considering the circumstances in which they were produced and distributed. The In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres has an original copy of the first issue from 12 February 1916 in its collection. The British Library holds original copies of several issues (31 July 1916; 1 December 1916; 26 February 1918).

===Facsimile editions===
A book containing facsimiles of the first fifteen issues of the &quot;Wipers Times&quot; was published in early 1918. In 1930 the entire series was published in one volume. This was reprinted (with introduction and notes) in 1973 and again in 1988. A further edition was produced in 2006.

==Television==
In 2013 the BBC broadcast a dramatisation, written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman. Captain Fred Roberts was played by Ben Chaplin and Lt Jack Pearson by Julian Rhind-Tutt, with Michael Palin and Emilia Fox in supporting roles.

==Theatre==
In September 2016, a stage adaptation of &quot;The Wipers Times&quot; opened at The Watermill Theatre in Newbury, adapted by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman from television script.

<doc id="959506" wikidata="Q1478548" url="?curid=959506" title="Legcuffs">
<text>Legcuffs are physical restraints used on the ankles of a person to allow walking only with a restricted stride and to prevent running and effective physical resistance. Frequently used alternative terms are leg cuffs, (leg/ankle) shackles, footcuffs, fetters or leg irons. The term &quot;fetter&quot; shares a root with the word &quot;foot&quot;.

Shackles are typically used on prisoners and slaves. Leg shackles also are used for chain gangs to keep them together.

Metaphorically, a fetter may be anything that restricts or restrains in any way, hence the word &quot;unfettered&quot;.

== History ==

The earliest fetters found in archaeological excavations date from the prehistoric age and are mostly of the puzzle lock type. Fetters are also referenced in ancient times in the Bible (, , )

A variety of restraint types already existed in Roman times. Some early versions of cup lock shackles existed at this time. These were widely used in medieval times, but their use declined when mass production made the manufacture of locks built into restraints affordable.

Simple fetter types continue to be used, like puzzle lock shackles as the typical slave iron, or irons riveted shut for prisoners being transported to overseas prison camps.

The first built-in locks often were of a simple screw-type, but soon developed into the &quot;Darby&quot; type. In Europe these continued to be used into the middle of the 20th century, whereas in the U.S. from the late 19th century onwards many new designs were invented and produced before handcuffs and leg irons of the Peerless type became the standard several decades ago.

One type of shackle, called an &quot;Oregon Boot&quot; or &quot;Gardner Shackle&quot;, was patented in 1866 by the warden of the Oregon State Penitentiary, J. C. Gardner. The shackle consisted of an iron band supported by braces which went down and under the prisoner&#x27;s foot. The shackle&#x27;s weight hobbled the prisoner&#x27;s movements to prevent escape, and long-term use would cause severe injury to the wearer. Use of this type of shackle was ended by the mid-20th century.

== Controversial use ==
In comparison to handcuffs, the wearing of leg irons may be found less restrictive. Thus, the prison authorities in several countries deem their long-term use acceptable. To avoid condoning this controversial practice, the countries of the European Union have banned exporting leg irons into non-EU countries. The countries that continue to make prisoners wear fetters long-term now tend to manufacture their own restraints.

<text>John Rankine (born Douglas Rankine Mason; 26 September 1918 – 8 August 2013) was a British science fiction author, who wrote books as John Rankine and Douglas R. Mason. Rankine was born in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales, attended Chester Grammar School, and in 1937 began study of English Literature and Experimental Psychology at the University of Manchester, where he was a friend of Anthony Burgess (mentioned in Burgess&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Little Wilson And Big God&quot;).

His first short story &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; was published in 1964, and his first novel &quot;From Carthage Then I Came&quot; followed in 1966. 

His 1972 novel &quot;The Resurrection of Roger Diment&quot; features the idea of an abbreviated life span for people, a theme which may have been adapted from William F. Nolan&#x27;s novel &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, though Mason&#x27;s story was developed differently.

Rankine also wrote television novels set in the same universe as the television series &quot;&quot;.

<text>is a Japanese video game composer. Some of his work include the &quot;Langrisser&quot;, &quot;Lunar&quot;, &quot;Grandia&quot;, and &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series.

==Biography==
Iwadare was born in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. He began to compose video game music after years of being involved with university bands. He began composing for Toaplan, arranging their arcade video game soundtracks for their Sega Mega Drive home console ports, notably the Mega Drive version of &quot;Zero Wing&quot; (1990), before composing for other companies such as Game Arts on their &quot;Lunar&quot; and &quot;Grandia&quot; series.

The first award he won was the Best Game Music award, the Mega Drive/Genesis category for &quot;&quot; in 1991. He also won the Best Game Music award in the Sega Saturn Music category for &quot;Grandia&quot; in 1997 and in the Dreamcast category for &quot;Grandia 2&quot; in 2000. Iwadare first composed music for Tokyo Disney Resort, in addition to Japanese dance programs, television programs, and radio programs. He dreams to have orchestral arrangements of his musical works, which he himself has done several times, as with the &quot;Gyakuten Meets Orchestra&quot; arrangements (orchestral arrangements of the &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series music).

He was a special guest at the 11th French Japan Expo that was held in July 2010 in Paris.

<text>The Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) is an international architectural firm with offices in Rotterdam, New York, Hong Kong, Doha, and Australia. The firm is currently led by eight partners - Rem Koolhaas, Reinier de Graaf, Ellen van Loon, Shohei Shigematsu, Iyad Alsaka, Chris van Duijn, Jason Long, and managing partner and architect David Gianotten.

==History==
Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis started working together in the early 1970s at the Architectural Association, the London-based architecture school, where Koolhaas was a student and Zenghelis an instructor. Their first major project was the utopian/dystopian project &quot;Exodus, or the Voluntary Prisoners of Architecture&quot; (1972). This project proposed a linear structure, cutting through London like a knife. Other projects included City of the Captive Globe (1974), Hotel Sphinx (1975), New Welfare Island/Welfare Palace Hotel (1975–76), Roosevelt Island Redevelopment (1975) – all &quot;paper&quot; projects that were not (intended to be) built, and all located in Manhattan, the subject of Koolhaas&#x27;s book &quot;Delirious New York, A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan&quot; (1975).

OMA was founded in 1975 by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and Greek architect Elia Zenghelis, along with Madelon Vriesendorp and Zoe Zenghelis. The founding of OMA coincided with the firm&#x27;s entry in the architectural design competition for a new Dutch parliament building in The Hague in 1978, with Zaha Hadid. OMA was one of the first-prize winners (among some 10 others), and the project was widely discussed and published. The commission, however, was given to an architect who did not participate in the competition. The entry for the Dutch parliament competition was the first of a series of controversial and successful international competition entries by OMA in the 1980s that were not built by OMA.

===OMA in the 1980s===
OMA&#x27;s first major commissions were The Netherlands Dance Theatre (1981) in The Hague and IJ-Plein Urban planning (1981–1988) in Amsterdam. Due to change of location a second design for the Dance Theater was made in 1984. Once completed in 1987, the building received international attention. Although full of &quot;first mistakes&quot;, the Dance Theater is the first realized design in which the ideas of Rem Koolhaas were made apparent. IJ-plein is located at Amsterdam&#x27;s IJ, a river that serves as the city&#x27;s waterfront, opposite the city center. The master plan consists of 1,300 dwellings and several facilities. OMA designed the school, the community center, and two blocks of housing.

A few other designs were realized in the 1980s: a police station in Almere (1982–1985), a bus station in Rotterdam (1985–1987, demolished in 2005), Byzantium apartment block in Amsterdam (1985–1991) and Checkpoint Charlie Housing in Berlin (1984–1990). Two houses were built in this period; the first house was a duo of patio villas (1985–1988) in the style of Mies van der Rohe, inserted in a dike in Rotterdam. The second – arguably the most full-grown design of OMA until that date – was Villa Dall&#x27;Ava in Paris (1984–1991). The client, according to Koolhaas, asked for a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. He wanted a glass house. She wanted a swimming pool on the roof. So many delays plagued the house that it &quot;became a record of our own (OMA&#x27;s) growing up&quot;.

Several studies were made during the late 1970s and 1980s: Study for the renovation of a panopticon prison in Arnhem in 1979, &quot;Boompjes&quot; tower slab in Rotterdam (1979), Housing for Berlin IBA (1980, not realised, and the reason OMA would not design anything in Berlin anymore in the 20th century, the Dutch Embassy Building being the comeback), master plan for a world exhibition in Paris (1983). Much more important however were the competition entries OMA designed in this period. They gained the office international fame (but not one design was actually built).

===OMA in the 1990s===
In the 1990s OMA gained renown through a series of groundbreaking entries in major competitions: e.g., Tres Grande Bibliothèque and Two Libraries for Jussieu University, Paris, France (1993). During these years OMA also realized ambitious projects, ranging from private residences to large scale urban plans: Villa dall’Ava, Paris, France (1991), Nexus Housing, Fukuoka, Japan (1991), Kunsthal, Rotterdam (1992).

The Euralille (1994), a 70-hectare business and civic center in Lille, northern France comprising the European hub for high-speed trains, transformed a once dormant center of more than 50 million inhabitants into a site offering connectivity, and a range of contemporary activities.

In 1999 OMA completed the Maison à Bordeaux, a villa for a client in the hills outside Bordeaux, France. The villa&#x27;s most striking feature is a platform in the very center of the house that moves freely between the three floors and allowed the client to move with his wheelchair on all three levels of the villa. The design was conceived in collaboration with engineer Cecil Balmond.

===OMA in the 21st century===
OMA&#x27;s recently completed projects include Axel Springer Campus in Berlin (2020), MEETT Exhibition and Convention Centre in Toulouse (2020), Galleria in Gwanggyo (2020), Brighton College (2020), Norra Tornen in Stockholm (2020), Potato Head Studios in Bali (2020), nhow Amsterdam RAI Hotel (2020), WA Museum Boola Bardip in Perth (2019), BLOX ? DAC in Copenhagen (2018), Fondation Galeries Lafayette in Paris (2018), Fondazione Prada in Milan (2018) and Qatar National Library (2017).

OMA was awarded the contract for the Seattle Central Library, completed in 2005, despite not having been on the list of firms originally invited to submit designs. Former partner and Seattle resident Joshua Prince-Ramus, heard from his mother about the meeting for interested firms at the last minute and flew in from the Netherlands. This 11-story glass and steel building is a striking addition to the Seattle cityscape.

In Asia, OMA completed the massive Central China Television Headquarters building in Beijing, and the new building for the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In January 2009 OMA won the competition to build the Taipei Performing Arts Center in Taiwan, completed and opened in 2022.

In October 2011, the Barbican Art Gallery launched their exhibition &quot;OMA/Progress&quot;, the first major presentation of OMA&#x27;s work in the UK, curated by Belgium-based creative collective Rotor.

==AMO==
In 1998, Rem Koolhaas and Reinier de Graaf founded AMO, a think tank within OMA dedicated to producing non-architectural work including exhibitions, branding campaigns, publishing, and energy planning. AMO has produced exhibitions at the Venice Biennale (on the Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg) and Venice Architecture Biennale (on the development of the Gulf, and, in 2010, on preservation), and guest-edited issues of the magazines &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Domus&quot;. AMO has produced work for Universal Studios, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Harvard University, Condé Nast, Heineken, and IKEA.

AMO projects also include the development of in-store technology for Prada, a strategy for the future of Volkswagen, a strategy for TMRW, work for Platform 21, new design institute in Amsterdam, a curatorial master plan for the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and &quot;Roadmap 2050: A Practical Guide to a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Europe&quot;. In 2008 AMO curated the exhibition &quot;Dubai Next&quot; at the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, and was one of the editors on the book &quot;Al Manakh&quot;, which details the rapid transformation of the Gulf region. In 2010 in collaboration with Archis and Think Tank, AMO made the follow-up, &quot;Al Manakh 2&quot;.

==Notable works==
===Seattle Central Library===

In 1999 OMA won a competition to design a new central library for the city of Seattle. The Seattle Central Library was completed and opened to the public on May 23, 2004. In 2005, the library earned a national American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture. The building has also been described as &quot;the most important new library to be built in a generation, and the most exhilarating&quot; by &quot;New Yorker&quot; architecture critic Paul Goldberger.
===Casa da Música, Porto===

Completed in 2005, the new home of the National Orchestra of Porto, the Casa da Música, stands on a new public square in the historic Rotunda da Boavista. With a distinct faceted form, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called it &quot;a building whose intellectual ardor is matched by its sensual beauty&quot;. Inside, the elevated 1,300-seat Grand Auditorium, in the shape of a shoebox, has corrugated glass façades at either end that open the hall to the city and offer Porto itself as a dramatic backdrop for performances. As well as the Grand Auditorium, conceived as a simple mass hollowed out end-to-end from the solid form of the building, the Casa da Música also contains a smaller, more flexible performance space with no fixed seating.
===Netherlands Embassy, Berlin===
Winner of the 2005 Mies van der Rohe Award (the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture), OMA&#x27;s Netherlands Embassy in Berlin is an isolated cube surrounded on two sides by a perimeter wall. The cube is punctured by a cantilevered meeting room and the visibility of the zig-zagging, interior path through the building.

===European flag proposal===
Following the signing of Treaties of Nice in May 2001, the then-President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, Koolhaas suggested a European flag, called the &quot;Barcode&quot;. The Barcode unites the flags of the EU countries into a single, colorful symbol.

In the current European flag, there is a fixed number of stars. In the Barcode, however, new Member States of the EU can be added without space constraints. Originally, the Barcode displayed 15 EU countries, and in 2004 the symbol was adapted to include ten new Member States. Croatia was added in 2013. The Barcode was officially used for the first time during the 2006 Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

<doc id="959572" wikidata="Q3445926" url="?curid=959572" title="Royal Exchange, Manchester">
<text>The Royal Exchange is a grade II listed building in Manchester, England. It is located in the city centre on land bounded by St Ann&#x27;s Square, Exchange Street, Market Street, Cross Street and Old Bank Street. The complex includes the Royal Exchange Theatre and the Royal Exchange Shopping Centre.

The Royal Exchange was heavily damaged in the Manchester Blitz and in the 1996 Manchester bombing. The current building is the last of several buildings on the site used for commodities exchange, primarily but not exclusively of cotton and textiles.

==History, 1729 to 1973==
The cotton industry in Lancashire was served by the cotton importers and brokers based in Liverpool who supplied Manchester and surrounding towns with the raw material needed to spin yarns and produce finished textiles. The Liverpool Cotton Exchange traded in imported raw cotton. In the 18th century, the trade was part of the slave trade in which African slaves were transported to America where the cotton was grown and then exported to Liverpool where the raw cotton was sold. The raw cotton was processed in Manchester and the surrounding cotton towns and Manchester Royal Exchange traded in spun yarn and finished goods throughout the world including Africa. Manchester&#x27;s first exchange opened in 1729 but closed by the end of the century. As the cotton industry boomed, the need for a new exchange was recognised.

Thomas Harrison designed the new exchange of 1809 at the junction of Market Street and Exchange Street. Harrison designed the exchange in the Classical style. It had two storeys above a basement and was constructed in Runcorn stone. The cost, £20,000, was paid for in advance by 400 members who bought £50 shares and paid £30 each to buy the site. The semi-circular north façade had fluted Doric columns. The exchange room where business was conducted covered 812 square yards. The ground floor also contained the members&#x27; library with more than 15,000 books. The basement housed a newsroom lit by a dome and plate-glass windows, its ceiling was supported by a circle of Ionic pillars spaced from the walls. The first-floor dining-room was accessed by a geometrical staircase. The exchange opened to celebrate the birthday of George III in 1809. It also contained other anterooms and offices.

As the cotton trade continued to expand, larger premises were required and its extension was completed in 1849. The Exchange was run by a committee of notable Manchester industrialists. From 1855 to 1860, the committee was chaired by Edmund Buckley.

The second exchange was replaced by a third designed by Mills &amp; Murgatroyd, constructed between 1867 and 1874. It was extended and modified by Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope between 1914 and 1931 to form the largest trading hall in England. The trading hall had three domes and was double the size of the current hall. The colonnade parallel to Cross Street marked its centre. On trading days merchants and brokers struck deals which supported the jobs of tens of thousands of textile workers in Manchester and the surrounding towns. Manchester&#x27;s cotton dealers and manufacturers trading from the Royal Exchange earned the city the name, Cottonopolis.

The exchange was seriously damaged during World War II when it took a direct hit from a bomb during a German air raid in the Manchester Blitz at Christmas in 1940. Its interior was rebuilt with a smaller trading area. The top stages of the clock tower, which had been destroyed, were replaced in a simpler form. Trading ceased in 1968, and the building was threatened with demolition.

==Architecture==

The exchange has four storeys and two attic storeys built on a rectangular plan in Portland stone. It was designed in the Classical style. Its slate roof has three glazed domes and on the ground floor an arcade orientated east to west. It has a central atrium at first-floor level. The ground floor facade has channelled rusticated piers and the first, second and third floors have Corinthian columns with entablature and a modillioned cornice. The first attic storey has a balustraded parapet while the second attic storey has a mansard roof. At the north-west corner is a Baroque turret and there are domes over other corners. The west side has a massive round-headed entrance arch with wide steps up and the first and second floor windows have round-headed arches. The third floor and first attic storey have mullioned windows.

==Theatre==
The building remained empty until 1973, when it was used to house a theatre company (69 Theatre Company); the company performed in a temporary theatre but there were plans for a permanent theatre whose cost was then estimated at £400,000. The Royal Exchange Theatre was founded in 1976 by five artistic directors: Michael Elliott, Caspar Wrede, Richard Negri, James Maxwell and Braham Murray. The theatre was opened by Laurence Olivier on 15 September 1976. In 1979, the artistic directorship was augmented by the appointment of Gregory Hersov.
The building was damaged on 15 June 1996 when an IRA bomb exploded in Corporation Street less than 50 yards away. The blast caused the dome to move, although the main structure was undamaged. That the adjacent St Ann&#x27;s Church survived almost unscathed is probably due to the sheltering effect of the stone-built exchange. Repairs, which were undertaken by Birse Group, took over two years and cost £32 million, a sum provided by the National Lottery. While the exchange was rebuilt, the theatre company performed in Castlefield. The theatre was repaired and provided with a second performance space, the Studio, a bookshop, craft shop, restaurant, bars and rooms for corporate hospitality. The theatre&#x27;s workshops, costume department and rehearsal rooms were moved to Swan Street. The refurbished theatre re-opened on 30 November 1998 by Prince Edward. The opening production, Stanley Houghton&#x27;s &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot; was the play that should have opened the day the bomb was exploded.

In 1999 the Royal Exchange was awarded &quot;Theatre of the Year&quot; in the Barclays Theatre Awards, in recognition of its refurbishment and ambitious re-opening season.

In 2014 Sarah Frankcom was appointed the sole artistic director.

In January 2016, the Royal Exchange was awarded Regional Theatre of the Year by &quot;The Stage&quot;. In announcing the award, &quot;The Stage&quot; said: &quot;This was the year that artistic director Sarah Frankcom really hit her stride at the Royal Exchange. The Manchester theatre in the round&#x27;s output during 2015 delivered its best year in quite some time.&quot;

In January 2018, the Royal Exchange Young Company won the &quot;School of the Year&quot; award at The Stage Awards 2018.

On 28 March 2019, the Royal Exchange announced that Frankcom was stepping down as artistic director of the theatre to take up a new post as director of the prestigious drama school LAMDA. On 8 July 2019, the theatre announced the appointment of Bryony Shanahan and Roy Alexander Weise as joint artistic directors.

===Theatres===

The theatre features a seven-sided steel and glass module that squats within the building&#x27;s Great Hall. It is a pure theatre in the round in which the stage area is surrounded on all sides, and above, by seating. Its unique design conceived by Richard Negri of the Wimbledon School of Art is intended to create a vivid and immediate relationship between actors and audiences. As the floor of the exchange was unable to take the weight of the theatre and its audience, the module is suspended from the four columns carrying the hall&#x27;s central dome. Only the stage area and ground-level seating rest on the floor. The 150-ton theatre structure opened in 1976 at a cost of £1 million amid some scepticism from Mancunians.

The theatre can seat an audience of up to 800 on three levels, making it the largest theatre in the round in the world. There are 400 seats at ground level in a raked configuration, above which are two galleries, each with 150 seats set in two rows.

The Studio is a 90-seat studio theatre with no fixed stage area and moveable seats, allowing for a variety of production styles (in the round, thrust etc.) Prior to 2020, the studio acted as host to a programme of visiting touring theatre companies, stand-up comedians and performances for young people.

====Theatre programme====
The Royal Exchange gives an average of 350 performances a year of nine professional theatre productions. Performances by the theatre company are occasionally given in London or from a 400-seat mobile theatre.
The company performs a varied programme including classic theatre and revivals, contemporary drama and new writing. Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov have been the mainstay of its repertoire but the theatre has staged classics from other areas of the canon including the British premieres of &quot;La Ronde&quot; and &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot; and revivals of &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;, &quot;Don Carlos&quot; and &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. American work has also been important – Tennessee Williams, O&#x27;Neill, Miller, August Wilson – as has new writing, with the world premieres of &quot;The Dresser&quot;, &quot;Amongst Barbarians&quot;, &quot;A Wholly Healthy Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Port&quot; to its name.

The Royal Exchange also presents visiting theatre companies in the Studio; folk, jazz and rock concerts; and discussions, readings and literary events. It engages children of all ages in drama activities and groups and has performances including these children and teens. Performances include &quot;The Freedom Bird&quot; and &quot;The Boy Who Ran from the Sea&quot;.

====The Bruntwood Prize====
In 2005, the Royal Exchange Theatre launched the Bruntwood Playwriting Competition to encourage a new generation of playwrights from the UK and Ireland. The competition had its roots in two regional competitions called WRITE which attracted over 400 entries. The first two competitions resulted in three festivals of new writing which showcased eight new writers, one of whom, Nick Leather, became writer in residence. The theatre produced his script, &quot;All the Ordinary Angels&quot;, in October 2005.

In 2006, 1,800 scripts were submitted for consideration. The winning entry was Ben Musgrave&#x27;s &quot;Pretend You Have Big Buildings&quot; for which he received a prize of £15,000 and his play was performed as part of the Manchester International Festival 2007.
In 2008 the Exchange and Bruntwood ran a second competition. Judges included Brenda Blethyn, Michael Sheen, Roger Michell and actor/director Richard Wilson. The £40,000 prize fund was split equally between Vivienne Franzmann for &quot;Mogadishu&quot; (main house and Lyric Hammersmith 2011), Fiona Peek for &quot;Salt&quot; (The Studio 2010), Andrew Sheridan for &quot;Winterlong&quot; (The Studio, 2011) and Naylah Ahmed for &quot;Butcher Boys&quot;.

<doc id="959598" wikidata="Q3359370" url="?curid=959598" title="River Mellte">
<text>The River Mellte (; ) is a river in south Wales. It is formed by the confluence of the Afon Llia and the Afon Dringarth. It then flows south through the village of Ystradfellte to Pontneddfechan where it joins with the Nedd Fechan to become the River Neath (). The river derives its name from &#x27;mellt&#x27; - the Welsh word for &#x27;lightning&#x27; - after its tendency to rise and fall rapidly in response to heavy rainfall.

== Underground section ==

The entire river runs underground for 1/2 km at Porth yr Ogof as it crosses the Carboniferous Limestone outcrop. It resurges at Pwll Glas. There are fifteen known entrances to the cave system. It is a complex maze of passageways, large and small, mostly developed along one or two major bedding planes. In extreme flood conditions the entire cave can flood to the roof. It is used heavily by school and adventure groups though sections of the cave can be hazardous for the unwary. There have been a number of fatalities over the years.

== Waterfalls ==

Downstream of Porth-yr-Ogof and within &#x27;Waterfall Country&#x27;, the river flows over several falls, the most significant of which are Sgwd Clun-gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-gwyn and Sgwd y Pannwr - meaning &#x27;white meadow fall&#x27;, &#x27;lower white meadow fall&#x27; and &#x27;fall of the woollen washer (or fuller)&#x27;.

== Habitat protection ==

The larger part of the river and its valley is protected both as a site of special scientific interest (Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Mellte a Moel Penderyn SSSI) and as a special area of conservation (Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC) in respect of the bryophyte flora which the deep and wooded nature of the valleys help to support.

== Industrial archaeology ==

The river provided the source of the power for the former gunpowder works at Pontneddfechan. The site is strung out along 3 km of the valley on both sides of the river. The remains of two weirs from which leats took water to drive a series of waterwheels and turbines can still be seen. All production on the site ceased in 1931.

== Access ==

Much of the river is accessible to walkers with both public footpaths and concessionary paths running beside the river and giving access to the various falls. Brecon Beacons National Park Authority has worked in conjunction with the Forestry Commission and the Countryside Council for Wales, and subsequently with their successor body Natural Resources Wales, to ensure that the path erosion that has resulted from the popularity of this area is halted and reversed. A concessionary path runs through the gunpowder works site.

Visitors can park at the pay and display car parks at Cwm Porth and the nearby Gwaun Hepste or else in Pontneddfechan.

== Outdoor activities ==

The river and surrounding area is a hot spot for many different outdoor activities including the famous waterfall walks, caving, canyoning, gorge walking and white water kayaking. Providing a fun day out with any activity you choose to do, each with their own dangers there are many companies that operate in the valley running fun days out for all. This is a classic white water kayaking river with paddlers that have kayaked all over the world still regarding it as one of their favourites on the grade 4/5 white water.

<text>In organic chemistry, organophosphates (also known as phosphate esters, or OPEs) are a class of organophosphorus compounds with the general structure , a central phosphate molecule with alkyl or aromatic substituents. They can be considered as esters of phosphoric acid. Organophosphates are best known for their use as pesticides.

Like most functional groups, organophosphates occur in a diverse range of forms, with important examples including key biomolecules such as DNA, RNA and ATP, as well as many insecticides, herbicides, nerve agents and flame retardants. OPEs have been widely used in various products as flame retardants, plasticizers, and performance additives to engine oil. The low cost of production and compatibility to diverse polymers made OPEs to be widely used in industry including textile, furniture, electronics as plasticizers and flame retardants. These compounds are added to the final product physically rather than by chemical bond. Due to this, OPEs leak into the environment more readily through volatilization, leaching, and abrasion. OPEs have been detected in diverse environmental compartments such as air, dust, water, sediment, soil and biota samples at higher frequency and concentration.

The popularity of OPEs as flame retardants came as a substitution for the highly regulated brominated flame retardants.

==Forms==
Organophosphates are a class of compounds encompassing a number of distinct but closely related function groups. These are primarily the esters of phosphoric acid and can be mono‑esters, di‑esters or tri‑esters depending on the number of attached organic groups (abbreviated as &#x27;R&#x27; in the image below). In general man‑made organophosphates are most often triesters, while biological organophosphates are usually mono- or di-esters. The hydolysis of triesters can form diesters and monoesters.

In the context of pesticides, derivatives of organophosphates such as organothiophosphates (P=S) or phosphorodiamidates (P-N) are included as being organophosphates. The reason is that these compound are converted into organophosphates biologically.

In biology the esters of diphosphoric acid and triphosphoric acid are generally included as organophosphates. The reason is again a practical one, as many cellular processes involve the mono- di and tri- phosphates of the same compound. For instance, the phosphates of adenosine (AMP, ADP, ATP) play a key role in many metabolic processes.

==Synthesis==
===Alcoholysis of ===
Phosphorus oxychloride reacts readily with alcohols to give organophosphates. This is the dominant industrial route and is responsible for almost all organophosphate production. Aluminum trichloride or magnesium chloride are often employed as catalysts.

When aliphatic alcohols are used the HCl by-product can react with the phosphate esters to give organochlorides and a lower ester.

This reaction is usually undesirable and is exacerbated by high reaction temperatures. It can be inhibited by the use of a base or the removal of HCl through sparging.

===Esterification of phosphoric acid and P2O5===
Esterifications of phosphoric acid with alcohols proceed less readily than the more common carboxylic acid esterifications, with the reactions rarely proceeding much further than the phosphate mono-ester. The reaction requires high temperatures, under which the phosphoric acid can dehydrate to form poly-phosphoric acids. These are exceedingly viscous and their linear polymeric structure renders them less reactive than phosphoric acid. Despite these limitations the reaction does see industrial use for the formation of monoalkyl phosphates, which are used as surfactants. A major appeal of this route is the low cost of phosphoric acid compared to phosphorus oxychloride.

P2O5 is the anhydride of phosphoric acid and acts similarly. The reaction yields equimolar amounts of di- and monoesters with no phosphoric acid. The process is mostly limited to primary alcohols, as secondary alcohols are prone to undesirable side reactions such as dehydration.

===Oxidation of phosphite esters===
Organophosphites can be easily oxidised to give organophosphates. This is not a common industrial route, however large quantities of organophosphites are manufactured as antioxidant stabilisers for plastics. The gradual oxidation of these generates organophosphates in the human environment.

===Phosphorylation===

The formation of organophosphates is an important part of biochemistry and living systems achieve this using a variety of enzymes. Phosphorylation is essential to the processes of both anaerobic and aerobic respiration, which involve the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the &quot;high-energy&quot; exchange medium in the cell. Protein phosphorylation is the most abundant post-translational modification in eukaryotes. Many enzymes and receptors are switched &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

===Laboratory methods===
Various specialised methods have been developed on the laboratory-scale for scientific investigations. These are rarely employed in bulk manufacturing. Examples include the Atherton-Todd reaction, which converts a dialkyl phosphite to a phosphoryl chloride. This can then react with an alcohol to give an organophosphate and HCl.

==Properties==
===Bonding===
The bonding in organophosphates has been a matter of prolonged debate; the phosphorus atom is classically hypervalent, as it possesses more bonds than the octet rule should allow. The focus of debate is usually on the nature of the phosphoryl P=O bond, which displays (in spite of the common depiction) non-classical bonding, with a bond order somewhere between 1 and 2. Early papers explained the hypervalence in terms of d-orbital hybridisation, with the energy penalty of promoting electrons into the higher energy orbitals being off-set by the stabilisation of additional bonding. Later advances in computational chemistry showed that d-orbitals played little significant role in bonding. Current models rely on either negative hyperconjugation, or a more complex arraignment with a dative-type bond from P to O, combined with back-donation from an oxygen 2p orbital. These models agree with the experimental observations of the phosphoryl as being shorter than P-OR bonds and much more polarised. It has been argued that a more accurate depiction is dipolar (i.e. (RO)3P+-O−), which is similar to the depiction of phosphorus ylides such as methylenetriphenylphosphorane. However in contrast to ylides, the phosphoryl group is unreactive and organophosphates are poor nucleophiles, despite the high concentration of charge on the phosphoryl oxygen. The polarisation accounts in part for the higher melting points of phosphates when compared to their corresponding phosphites. The bonding in penta-coordinate phosphoranes (i.e. P(OR)5) is entirely different and involves three-center four-electron bonds.

===Acidity===
Phosphate esters bearing P-OH groups are acidic. The pKa of the first OH group is typically between 1-2, while the second OH deprotonates at a pKa between 6-7. As such, phosphate mono- and di-esters are negatively charged at physiological pH. This is of great practical importance, as it makes these compounds far more resistant to degradation by hydrolysis or other forms of nucleophilic attack, due to electrostatic repulsion between negative charges. This effects nearly all organophosphate biomolecules, such as DNA and RNA and accounts in-part for their high stability. The presence of this negative charge also makes these compounds much more water soluble.

===Water solubility===
The water solubility of organophosphates is an important factor in biological, industrial and environmental settings. The wide variety of substitutes used in organophosphate esters results in great variations in physical properties. OPEs exhibit a wide range of octanol/water partition coefficients where log Kow values range from -0.98 up to 10.6. Mono- and di- esters are usually water soluble, particularity biomolecules. Tri-esters such as flame retardants and plasticisers have positive log Kow values ranging between 1.44 and 9.49, signifying hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic OPEs are more likely to be bioaccumulated and biomagnified in aquatic ecosystems. Halogenated organophosphates tend to be denser than water and sink, causing them to accumulate in sediments.

==Industrial materials==
===Pesticides===
Organophosphates are best known for their use as pesticides. The vast majority are insecticides and are used either to protect crops, or as vector control agents to reduce the transmission of diseases spread by insects, such as mosquitoes. Health concerns have seen their use significantly decrease since the turn of the century. Glyphosate is sometimes called an organophosphate, but is in-fact a phosphonate. Its chemistry, mechanism of toxicity and end-use as a herbicide are different from the organophosphate insecticides.

The development of organophosphate insecticides dates back to the 1930s and is generally credited to Gerhard Schrader. At the time pesticides were largely limited to arsenic salts (calcium arsenate, lead arsenate and Paris green) or pyrethrin plant extracts, all of which had major problems. Schrader was seeking more effective agents, however while some organophosphates were found to be far more dangerous to insects than higher animals, the potential effectiveness of others as chemical weapons did not go unnoticed. The development of organophosphate insecticides and the earliest nerve agents was conjoined, with Schrader also developing the nerve agents tabun and sarin. Organophosphate pesticides were not commercialised until after WWII. Parathion was among the first marketed, followed by malathion and azinphosmethyl . Although organophosphates were used in considerable qualities they were originally less important than organochlorine insecticides such as DDT, dieldrin, and heptachlor. When many of the organochlorines were banned in the 1970s, following the publishing of Silent Spring, organophosphates became the most important class of insecticides globally. Nearly 100 were commercialised, with the following being a varied selection:
*Acephate
*Azinphos-methyl
*Bensulide
*Chlorethoxyfos
*Coumaphos
*Diazinon
*Dichlorvos
*Dicrotophos
*Dimethoate
*Disulfoton
*Ethion
*Ethoprop
*Ethyl parathion
*Fenamiphos
*Fenitrothion
*Fonofos
*Isoxathion
*Malathion
*Methamidophos
*Methidathion
*Mevinphos
*Naled
*Phosmet
*Profenofos
*Propetamphos
*Quinalphos
*Sulfotep
*Tebupirimfos
*Temephos
*Terbufos
*Tetrachlorvinphos
*Triazofos
Organophosphate insecticides are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which disrupt the transmission of nerve signals in exposed organisms, with fatal results. The risk of human death through organophosphate poisoning was obvious from the start and led to efforts to lower toxicity against mammals while not reducing efficacy against insects.

The majority of organophosphate insecticides are organothiophosphates (P=S) or phosphorodiamidates (P-N), both of which are significantly weaker acetylcholinesterase inhibitors than the corresponding phosphates (P=O). They are &#x27;activated&#x27; biologically by the exposed organism, via oxidative conversion of P=S to P=O, hydroxylation, or other related process which see them transformed into organophosphates. In mammals these transformations occur almost exclusively in the liver, while in insects they take place in the gut and fat body. As the transformations are handled by different enzymes in different classes of organism it is possible to find compounds which activate more rapidly and completely in insects, and thus display more targeted lethal action.

This selectivity is far from perfect and organophosphate insecticides remain acutely toxic to humans, with many thousands estimated to be killed each year due to intentional (suicide) or unintentional poisoning. Beyond their acute toxicity, long-term exposure to organophosphates is associated with a number of heath risks, including organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (muscle weakness) and developmental neurotoxicity. There is limited evidence that certain compounds cause cancer, including malathion and diazinon. Children and farmworkers are considered to be at greater risk.

Pesticide regulation in the United States and the regulation of pesticides in the European Union have both been increasing restrictions on organophosphate pesticides since the 1990s, particularly when used for crop protection. The use of organophosphates has decreased considerably since that time, having been replaced by pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, which are effective a much lower levels. Reported cases of organophosphate poisoning in the US have reduced during this period. Regulation in the global south can be less extensive.

In 2015, only 3 of the 50 most common crop-specific pesticides used in the US were organophosphates (Chlorpyrifos, Bensulide, Acephate). No new organophosphate pesticides have been commercialised in the 21st century. The situation in vector control is fairly similar, despite different risk trade-offs, with the global use of organophosphate insecticides falling by nearly half between 2010 and 2019. Pirimiphos-methyl, Malathion and Temefos are still important, primarily for the control of malaria in the Asia-Pacific region. The continued use of these agents is being challenged by the emergence of insecticide resistance.

=== Flame retardants ===

Flame retardants are added to materials to prevent combustion and to delay the spread of fire after ignition. Organophosphate flame retardants are part of a wider family of phosphorus-based agents which include organic phosphonate and phosphinate esters, in addition to inorganic salts. When some prominent brominated flame retardant were banned in the early 2000s phosphorus-based agents were promoted as safer replacements. This has led to a large increase in their use, with an estimated 1 million tonnes of organophosphate flame retardants produced in 2018. Safety concerns have subsequently been raised about some of these reagents, with several under regulatory scrutiny.

Organophosphate flame retardants were first developed in the first half of the twentieth century in the from of triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate and tributyl phosphate for use in plastics like cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate. Use in cellulose products is still significant, but the largest area of application is now in plasticized vinyl polymers, primarily PVC. The more modern organophosphate flame retardants come in 2 major types; chlorinated aliphatic compounds or aromatic diphosphates. The chlorinated compounds TDCPP, TCPP and TCEP are all involatile liquids, of which TCPP is perhaps the most important. They are used in polyurethane (insulation, soft furnishings), PVC (wire and cable) phenolic resins and epoxy resins (varnishes, coatings and adhesives). The most important of the diphosphates is bisphenol-A bis(diphenyl phosphate), with related analogues based around resorcinol and hydroquinone. These are used in polymer blends of engineering plastics, such as PPO/HIPS and PC/ABS, which are commonly used to make casing for electrical items like TVs, computers and home appliances.

Organophosphates act multifunctionally to retard fire in both the gas phase and condensed (solid) phase. Halogenated organophosphates are more active overall as their degradation products interfere with combustion directly in the gas phase. All organophosphates have activity in the condensed phase, by forming phosphorus acids which promote char formation, insulating the surface from heat and air.

Organophosphates were originally thought to be a safe replacements for brominated flame retardants, however many are now coming under regulatory pressure due to their apparent health risks. The chlorinated organophosphates may be carcinogenic, while others such as tricresyl phosphate have necrotoxic properties. 
Bisphenol-A bis(diphenyl phosphate) can hydrolyse to form Bisphenol-A which is under significant scrutiny as potential endocrine-disrupting chemical. Although their names imply that they are a single chemical, some (but not all) are produced as complex mixtures. For instance, commercial grade TCPP can contain 7 different isomers, while tricresyl phosphate can contain up to 10. This makes their safety profiles harder to ascertain, as material from different producers can have different compositions.

===Plasticisers===

Plasticisers are added to polymers and plastics to improve their flexibility and processability, giving a softer more easily deformable material. In this way brittle polymers can be made more durable. The most frequently plasticised polymers are the vinyls (PVC, PVB, PVA and PVCA), as well as cellulose plastics (cellulose acetate, nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate butyrate). PVC dominates the market, consuming 80-90% of global plasticiser production. PVC can accept large amounts of plasticiser; it is common for products to be 0-50% plasticiser by mass, but loadings can be as high as 70-80% in the case of plastisols.

Pure PVC is more than 60% chlorine by mass and is difficult to burn, but its flammability increases the more it is plasticised. Organophosphates find use because they are multifunctional; primarily plasticising but also imparting flame resistance. Compounds are typically triaryl or alkyl diaryl phosphates, with cresyl diphenyl phosphate and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate being important examples respectively. These are both liquids with high boiling points. Organophosphates are more expensive than traditional plasticisers and so tend be used in combination with other plasticisers and flame retardants.

===Hydraulic fluids and lubricant additives===
Similar to their use as plastisiers, organophosphates are well suited to use as hydraulic fluids due to their low freezing points and high boiling points, fire-resistance, non-corrosiveness, excellent boundary lubrication properties and good general chemical stability. The triaryl phosphates are the most important group, with tricresyl phosphate being the first to be commercialised in the 1940s, with trixylyl phosphate following shortly after. Butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate and propylphenyl diphenyl phosphate became available after 1960.

In addition to their use as hydraulic base-stock, organophosphates (tricresyl phosphate) and metal organothiophosphates (zinc dithiophosphate) are used as both an antiwear additives and extreme pressure additives in lubricants, where they remain effective even at high temperatures.

===Metal extractants===
Organophosphates have long been used in the field of extractive metallurgy to liberate valuable rare earth metals from their ores. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid and tributyl phosphate are used for the liquid–liquid extraction of these elements from the acidic mixtures form by the leaching of mineral deposits. The same compounds are also used in nuclear reprocessing, as part of the PUREX process.

===Surfactants===
Mono- and di- phosphate esters of alcohols (or alcohol ethoxylates) act as surfactants (detergents). Although they are very common in biology as phospholipids, their industrial use is largely limited to certain niche areas. Compared to the more common sulfur-based anionic surfactants (such as LAS or SLES), phosphate ester surfactants are more expensive and generate less foam. Benefits include high stability at extremes of pH, low skin irritation and a high tolerance to dissolved salts.
In agricultural settings monoesters of fatty alcohol ethoxylates are used, which are able to disperse poorly miscible or insoluble pesticides into water. As they are low-foaming these mixtures can be sprayed effectively onto fields, while a high salt tolerance allows co-spraying of pesticides and inorganic fertilisers.
Low-levels of phosphate mono-esters, such as potassium cetyl phosphate, find use in cosmetic creams and lotions. These in oil-in-water formulations are primarily based on non-ionic surfactants, with the anionic phosphate acting as emulsion-stabilisers. Phosphate tri-esters such as tributyl phosphate are used as anti-foaming agent in paints and concrete.

===Nerve agents===

Although the first phosphorus compounds observed to act as cholinesterase inhibitors were organophosphates, the vast majority of nerve agents are instead phosphonates containing a P-C bond. Only a handful of organophosphate nerve agents were developed between the 1930s and 1960s, including diisopropylfluorophosphate, VG and NPF. Between 1971 and 1993 the Soviet Union developed many new potential nerve agents, commonly known as the Novichok agents. Some of these can be considered organophosphates (in a broad sense), being derivatives of fluorophosphoric acid. Examples include A-232, A-234, A-262, C01-A035 and C01-A039. The most notable of these is A-234, which was claimed to be responsible for the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury (UK) 2018.

==In nature==
The detection of OPEs in the air as far away as Antarctica at concentrations around 1 ng/m3 suggests their persistence in air, and their potential for long-range transport. OPEs were measured in high frequency in air and water and widely distributed in northern hemisphere. The chlorinated OPEs (TCEP, TCIPP, TDCIPP) in urban sampling sites and non-halogenated like TBOEP in rural areas respectively were frequently measured in the environment across multiple sites. In the Laurentian Great Lakes total OPEs concentrations were found to be 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of brominated flame retardants measured in similar air. Waters from rivers in Germany, Austria, and Spain have been consistently recorded for TBOEP and TCIPP at highest concentrations. From these studies, it is clear that OPE concentrations in both air and water samples are often orders of magnitude higher than other flame retardants, and that concentrations are largely dependent on sampling location, with higher concentrations in more urban, polluted locations.

<doc id="959642" wikidata="Q347818" url="?curid=959642" title="Thomas Curtis (athlete)">
<text>Thomas Pelham Curtis (January 9, 1873 – May 23, 1944) was an American athlete and the winner of the 110 metres hurdles at the 1896 Summer Olympics.

Curtis, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student of electrical engineering, travelled to Athens as a member of the Boston Athletic Association. Curtis was also a student at Columbia University.

At the first day of the first modern Olympic Games, Curtis advanced to the 100 metres final by winning his heat with a time of 12.2 seconds. He later withdrew from that race to prepare for the 110 metres hurdles final, which was his main event at the Olympics. That competition turned into a personal race between Curtis and Grantley Goulding from Great Britain after Frantz Reichel and William Welles Hoyt withdrew. At the start Curtis gained a small lead, but Goulding reached him at the first hurdle. At the last hurdle, Goulding was leading, but Curtis managed to throw himself to the line first. The officials stated that Curtis had won by 5 centimetres. Both athletes had a time of 17.6 seconds.

As an eager amateur photographer, Curtis made many valuable pictures in Athens. He served as captain in the Massachusetts National Guard and was a military aide to Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge in World War I. He also participated in the development of the toaster and published several humorous memories about the first modern Olympic Games. The most famous of them is &quot;High Hurdles and White Gloves&quot; (1932).

<doc id="959648" wikidata="Q2978517" url="?curid=959648" title="Ryuji Sasai">
<text>is a Japanese video game composer and bass guitarist. He is best known for his work on &quot;Xak&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot;. His musical career came about when he was 15 years old, and he formed a band. Before entering the gaming industry, Sasai was involved in the anime department, scoring two television series and a film. After creating music for four games as a freelancer, he was employed at Square from 1991 to 1998, where he worked on five games in total. Sasai often collaborated with fellow composers Tadahiro Nitta and Chihiro Fujioka during his career. He has also been a member of the rock bands Novela and Action and is currently performing as a bassist.

==Biography==
Born in Osaka, Japan, Sasai began his musical career at the age of 15, playing instruments and forming a band. In 1982, he joined the rock band Novela; he was an instrumentalist and songwriter for several albums. During his stint with the band, he composed music for the anime series &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot; (1982) and &quot;Adventures of the Little Koala&quot; (1984). After Novela dissolved in 1984, he provided the score for the 1986 film &quot;Windaria&quot; alongside Satoshi Kadokura. He became a member of the band Action in 1988, where he was a bass guitarist and a backing vocalist; the band was active for a decade.

His debut as a video game composer came with Crystal Software&#x27;s &quot;Mugen No Shinzo III&quot; in 1989 with Chihiro Fujioka. After sending his demo tapes and résumé to every software house and game company listed in the PC-specialized magazines, he got one response from Micro Cabin. He then composed music for three &quot;Xak&quot; games with Tadahiro Nitta: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Fray in Magical Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Xak II: The Rising of the Red Moon&quot;. During this time, he was working as a freelance composer under pseudonyms for unspecified titles. In 1991, after Square hired Fujioka to be a director, Sasai was invited to join the company as they needed composers to assist Nobuo Uematsu and Kenji Ito. His first assignment was to create the soundtrack to the Game Boy title &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot;. Sasai composed the majority of the score, with director Fujioka handling four pieces.

His subsequent work for Square was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; (known as &quot;Mystic Quest Legend&quot; in Europe), which he composed with Yasuhiro Kawakami; it was the first game in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series not composed by regular series composer Uematsu. After a hiatus during the peak of Action&#x27;s activity, Square assigned Sasai as the sole composer for the Japan-exclusive game &quot;Rudra no Hihō&quot; (1996). Afterward, he contributed the track &quot;Character Select&quot; for the score to the multi-composer game &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;; the games arranged album, &quot;Tobal No. 1 Remixes Electrical Indian&quot;, featured the song. The music team GUIDO completed the album&#x27;s arrangement.

After completing the score to &quot;Bushido Blade 2&quot; and Action dispersed in 1998, Sasai left Square. He was initially going to score two role-playing games after &quot;Bushido Blade 2&quot;, but it did not come to pass due to circumstances with the company. Since the company had not given him any other assignments, he decided to leave Square. Sasai is currently a bass guitarist for the Queen tribute band Queen Mania and the rock band Spiders from Cabaret.

==Musical style and influences==
Sasai&#x27;s &quot;Bushido Blade 2&quot; soundtrack consists of hard rock music and traditional Japanese instruments and harmonies. A member of the tribute band Queen Mania, Sasai cites Queen as a significant musical influence. Preferring the musical genres heavy metal and alternative rock, his favorite bands are Extreme, Judas Priest, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. He has said that he also listens to hard rock and progressive rock. When he started working in the game industry, he immersed himself in film and classical music.

<doc id="959652" wikidata="Q2785898" url="?curid=959652" title="Abrams v. United States">
<text>Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States upholding the criminal arrests of several defendants under the Sedition Act of 1918, which was an amendment to the Espionage Act of 1917. The law made it a criminal offense to criticize the production of war materiel with intent to hinder the progress of American military efforts. 

The defendants had been arrested in 1919 for printing and distributing anti-war leaflets in New York City. After their conviction under the Sedition Act, they appealed on free speech grounds. The Supreme Court upheld the convictions under the clear and present danger standard, which allowed the suppression of certain types of speech in the public interest. 

The ruling is best known for its dissent by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, which led to a gradual liberalization of the Supreme Court&#x27;s First Amendment jurisprudence. The clear and present danger standard, used in this ruling to uphold the criminal convictions, fell out of favor and was largely overturned by the Supreme Court in 1969. 

==Background ==
On August 12, 1919, Hyman Rosansky was arrested after throwing flyers out of a fourth-floor window of a hat factory in Lower Manhattan. Rosansky had received the flyers at an anarchist meeting the previous day. There were two separate leaflets: one in English and signed &quot;Revolutionists&quot; that denounced the sending of American troops to intervene in the Russian Civil War; and a second in Yiddish that favored the communist side in the Russian Revolution and denounced the American production of weapons to be used against the communists. Jacob Abrams, whose name was eventually used in the Supreme Court ruling, had printed the leaflets in his basement workshop. Relying on information provided by Rosansky, police soon arrested Abrams, Mollie Steimer, and four other activists. All including Rosansky had emigrated to the United States from Russia and supported the communists in their efforts to depose the incumbent czarist regime.

The defendants were charged under the Sedition Act of 1918 for inciting resistance to American military actions and urging curtailment of production of essential war materiel. They were also charged for conspiring with Germany, which was an opponent of both the United States and Russia at the time. One defendant&quot;–&quot;Jacob Schwartz&quot;–&quot; died while in jail from the Spanish Flu, while another&quot;–&quot; Gabriel Porter&quot;–&quot;was acquitted. The five remaining defendants were convicted in criminal court and received various sentences ranging from three to twenty years in prison; some were also condemned to deportation to their native Russia after the completion of their prison sentences. The defendants attempted a free speech argument and claimed that the Sedition Act conflicted with the free speech protections of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but this argument was rejected by the criminal court. All five appealed their convictions to the United States Supreme Court with a focus on the First Amendment argument.

==Opinion of the court== 
The Supreme Court ruled 7–2 that the defendants&#x27; freedom of speech had not been violated. Justice John Hessin Clarke, author of the majority opinion, argued that Congress had passed the Sedition Act with the rationale that critics of American military efforts presented an &quot;imminent danger that it [the offending speech] will bring about forthwith certain substantive evils that the United States constitutionally may seek to prevent.&quot; The Supreme Court upheld the defendants&#x27; criminal convictions per the clear and present danger test that it had formulated earlier the same year in &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;, a case that also involved a speech-related arrest under the Sedition Act. 

Clarke argued that the defendants&#x27; leaflets in &quot;Abrams&quot; demonstrated an intent to hinder production of war materiel, which was a clear violation of the terms of the Sedition Act and could not be characterized as simple expressions of political opinion. Clarke concluded: 

For the defendants&#x27; claim that they were merely supporters of Russian revolutionaries in a conflict that was purely internal to Russia, Clarke found a connection to the then-current conflict between the United States and Germany. Clarke reasoned that the defendants resented &quot;our Government [for] sending troops into Russia as a strategic operation against the Germans on the eastern battle front.&quot; During the hearing, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes objected on the grounds that the criminal prosecutors should have shown specific intent by the defendants to bring about the harms for which they were charged, but the majority dismissed this argument. 

The Court held that the leaflets&#x27; call for the curtailment of war materiel production violated the Sedition Act and the arrests were justifiable per statute. Congress&#x27;s determination that all such propaganda posed a danger to the war effort was ruled sufficient to meet the standard set in &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; for prosecution of attempted crimes, regardless of whether the attempt was made through speech or writing. Thus, the criminal convictions were upheld.

==Holmes&#x27;s dissent==

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes had sided with the majority in the earlier cases, notably &quot;Schenck&quot;, in which the Supreme Court upheld speech-related criminal convictions under the Sedition Act. In &quot;Abrams&quot;, Holmes issued a dissenting opinion that reflected a change in his views on criticism of government and the intent to create harms to the public or the nation. Holmes rejected the argument that the defendants&#x27; leaflets posed a clear and present danger and argued that the defendants had received prison sentences &quot;not for what the indictment alleges but for the creed that they avow.&quot; 

Holmes wrote that, although the defendant&#x27;s leaflets called for a cessation of weapons production, they had not violated the Sedition Act of 1918 because the leaflets did not display a criminal intent &quot;to cripple or hinder the United States in the prosecution of the war&quot; against Germany. The defendants were objecting only to the American military&#x27;s intervention in the Russian civil war. Holmes&#x27;s previous opinion in &quot;Schenck&quot; had been criticized by Constitutional scholar Zechariah Chafee for failing to distinguish between speech-based opposition to military operations and intent to commit a crime. He also objected to the idea that the Sedition Act could be used to prosecute all seditious speech regardless of the military conflict being discussed. 

Holmes continued with a defense of free speech and criticism of government, which he believed should be protected by the Constitution. He may have also been influenced by the fact that some friends in the Jewish immigrant community had recently been harassed by authorities for their left-wing political opinions. Holmes also had experience as a judge in criminal court and was familiar with the common law of convictions and sentencing, which is believed to have informed his changing views on the prosecution of speech-based offenses. In &quot;Abrams&quot;, he found the prison sentences to be excessive, arguing that even if the defendants&#x27; speech could be punished as an attempted crime, even if &quot;enough can be squeezed from these poor and puny anonymities to turn the color of legal litmus paper,&quot; they had been convicted not for dangerous crimes, but for their beliefs. 

Holmes then turned to the value of speech that is critical of government, and the ability of those who disagree to react to that speech, without intervention by government or punishment of those with unpopular opinions. He argued that efforts to suppress opinions by force therefore contradict a fundamental principle of the Constitution. While he did not use the term himself, this focus on public debate rather than government prosecution has since been dubbed the marketplace of ideas. Holmes&#x27;s passionate, indignant opinion on this matter has become very influential and is often quoted:

==Subsequent developments==
While the criminal convictions against Jacob Abrams and the other defendants were upheld by the Supreme Court, the dissent by Holmes has proven to be more influential for later First Amendment jurisprudence. 

There is evidence that Holmes&#x27;s dissent in Abrams was influenced by Zechariah Chafee, and colleagues like Louis Brandeis and Learned Hand, while his apparently inconsistent views of speech that criticizes the government attracted some criticism. However, his dissent was eventually acknowledged as a significant turning point in the American judiciary&#x27;s views on political speech, with the marketplace of ideas analysis gradually becoming the standard in court disputes about government suppression of speech. This indeed happened by the 1950s-60s, as the judiciary transitioned to a focus on the risk of imminent lawless action caused by speech that government officials find inappropriate. 

Those later cases were informed by the government&#x27;s actions against its critics during World War II, at which time attitudes had changed since &quot;Abrams&quot; which was engendered by World War I. A key turning point was a Second Circuit opinion by Judge Learned Hand in &quot;U.S. v. Dennis&quot; in 1950, critiquing the clear and present danger standard. This inspired further dissents in favor of unfettered political speech from a bitterly divided Supreme Court when they heard the case on appeal the following year. The clear and present danger standard was gradually dropped in favor of the imminent lawless action standard, with more input for the marketplace of ideas. The imminent lawless action standard was confirmed by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; in 1969. That ruling effectively overturned &quot;Abrams&quot; and several other Supreme Court precedents from the same era.

Contemporary discussions about the case were robust. Due to popular pressure, Congress repealed the statute at the heart of &quot;Abrams&quot; and several other recent Supreme Court rulings&quot;–&quot;the Sedition Act of 1918&quot;–&quot;just one year after &quot;Abrams. M&quot;ost arrestees were granted clemency by President Woodrow Wilson.

<text>Thomas Pascal Jones (1774–March 11, 1848) was a British-born engineer and publisher in the United States of America.

==Biography==
Born in Herefordshire in Britain in 1774, Jones emigrated to America as a youth.

In 1825 he became a cofounder as well as publisher and editor of &quot;American Mechanics Magazine&quot;.

Jones first lived in Washington, D.C., and served as superintendent and examiner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Later, he lived in New York City and taught at the Franklin Institute, in Philadelphia.

In 1828, Jones merged &quot;American Mechanics Magazine&quot; with the institute&#x27;s existing magazine, entitling it &quot;Journal of the Franklin Institute&quot;. He remained its editor until his death in 1848. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1831 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834.

Also in 1828, he became the professor of chemistry of the Medical Department of the Columbian College, today&#x27;s George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, replacing Richard Randall. In 1839 his position changed to the professor of chemistry and pharmacy, which he resigned the next year.

<text>Thomas ap Catesby Jones (24 April 1790 – 30 May 1858) was an American naval officer who served during the War of 1812 and the Mexican–American War.

==Early life==

Thomas ap Catesby Jones was born on 24 April 1790 in Westmoreland County, Virginia, to Catesby and Lettice (Turberville) Jones. The Jones family had originated in Wales and the middle name &quot;ap Catesby&quot; was a gesture to the patronymic surnames traditionally used in Wales; &quot;Thomas ap Catesby&quot; in Welsh means &quot;Thomas, son of Catesby&quot;.

Jones&#x27; father died on 23 September 1801 leaving the family destitute. Jones and his older brother, Roger were taken in by an uncle, Meriwether Jones of Richmond, Virginia. His mother died in December 1804 after a long illness leaving Jones an orphan at age 14. His uncle provided for his and his brother&#x27;s education at Richmond Academy until the expense of private school became a burden. They studied with a private tutor after leaving the school. Roger Jones later became Adjutant General of the U.S. Army.

==War of 1812==
Jones was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy on 22 November 1805 at the age of fifteen. Owing to a lack of openings for midshipmen he was not ordered to active duty. He was furloughed home and advised to study geography, navigation, and surveying so that his chances of getting an active assignment would improve. After the &quot;Chesapeake–Leopard&quot; affair, the Navy mobilized its gunboats and Jones was ordered to report to Norfolk, Virginia, where he was assigned to gunboat &quot;No. 10&quot;, reporting the first week of August 1807. Jones received honors for bravery at the 1814 Battle of Lake Borgne in Louisiana, where despite being defeated, he succeeded in delaying the British advance prior to the Battle of New Orleans.

==Between wars==

In 1826, Commodore Jones while in command of the veteran sloop-of-war &quot;Peacock&quot;, signed treaties with the Kingdom of Tahiti and Hawaiian Kingdom. On September 6, 1826, Jones signed a treaty with Queen regent Pōmare Vahine on the behalf of the infant Pōmare III and other chiefs of Tahiti. On December 23, 1826, Jones signed a treaty with Queen regent Kaʻahumanu and other chiefs of Hawaii on behalf of the young Kamehameha III. In 1827, &quot;Peacock&quot; was severely damaged in an attack by a whale. Upon return to New York in October 1827, she was decommissioned and broken up in 1828. She was rebuilt as &quot;Peacock&quot; (1828), to serve as an exploration ship of the United States Exploring Expedition. Jones was to have commanded the expedition, but lack of funding delayed the expedition until 1838, by which time he had resigned the appointment.

In May 1836, an act of Congress authorized the President to establish the five year United States Exploring Expedition &quot;to the Pacific Ocean and South Seas&quot;, the first extra-continental American scientific exploration. Jones was appointed Commander of the Expedition. Delays in Expedition departure dates, and various other disagreements, led to Jones (and certain scientists, including botanist Asa Gray) declining the position in December 1837. The position was subsequently offered to Charles Wilkes. From 1841 to 1844, Jones commanded the United States Pacific Squadron, and again from 1848 to 1850. In 1842, four years before the start of the Mexican–American War, Jones mistakenly thought that war had begun. He seized the California port of Monterey and held it for one day before returning control to Mexico.

Hearing that Royal Navy officer Lord George Paulet had occupied the Hawaiian Kingdom, he sailed there and arrived July 22, 1843. The king was restored July 31, and Jones tried to hasten peace by hosting all parties to dinner aboard his ship. In 1843, Jones returned a young deserter, Herman Melville, to the U.S. from the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were then known. Later, Melville modeled &quot;Commodore J—&quot; in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, and the Commodore in &quot;White-Jacket&quot; after Jones. In 1827 &quot;Peacock&quot; under Jones&#x27;s command had been severely damaged in an attack by a whale, which Melville took to have been a sperm whale. &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; Chapter 45 (&quot;The Affidavit&quot;) is most probably especially shaped by part of the career of Jones. By early 1844 Alexander Dallas had replaced Jones as Pacific commander.

==Later career==
In 1848, Jones arrived in Mazatlán just at the end of the Mexican–American War, maintaining order until he could transport those who had aided the United States in that war to Monterey. For the next two years, during the chaotic Gold Rush days, Jones provided a U.S. Navy presence in the San Francisco area while the United States debated what to do with the newly acquired California Territory.

In 1850, in a politically charged court-martial shortly after &quot;White-Jacket&quot; was published, Jones was found guilty on three counts mostly related to &quot;oppression&quot; of junior officers and relieved of command for two-and-a-half years. In 1853, President Millard Fillmore reinstated him and in 1858, the United States Congress restored his pay.

<text>A silhouette (, ) is the image of a person, animal, object or scene represented as a solid shape of a single colour, usually black, with its edges matching the outline of the subject. The interior of a silhouette is featureless, and the silhouette is usually presented on a light background, usually white, or none at all. The silhouette differs from an outline, which depicts the edge of an object in a linear form, while a silhouette appears as a solid shape. Silhouette images may be created in any visual artistic medium, but were first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed.

Cutting portraits, generally in profile, from black card became popular in the mid-18th century, though the term &quot;silhouette&quot; was seldom used until the early decades of the 19th century, and the tradition has continued under this name into the 21st century. They represented a cheap but effective alternative to the portrait miniature, and skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait, by far the most common style, in a matter of minutes, working purely by eye. Other artists, especially from about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could be equally quick.

From its original graphic meaning, the term &quot;silhouette&quot; has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is backlit and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as &quot;in silhouette&quot;. Because a silhouette emphasises the outline, the word has also been used in fields such as fashion, fitness, and concept art to describe the shape of a person&#x27;s body or the shape created by wearing clothing of a particular style or period.

==Etymology and origins==

The word &quot;silhouette&quot; is derived from the name of Étienne de Silhouette, a French finance minister who, in 1759, was forced by France&#x27;s credit crisis during the Seven Years&#x27; War to impose severe economic demands upon the French people, particularly the wealthy. Because of de Silhouette&#x27;s austere economies, his name became synonymous with anything done or made cheaply and so with these outline portraits. Prior to the advent of photography, silhouette profiles cut from black card were the cheapest way of recording a person&#x27;s appearance.

The term &quot;silhouette&quot;, although existing from the 18th century, was not applied to the art of portrait-making until the 19th century. In the 18th and early 19th century, &quot;profiles&quot; or &quot;shades&quot; as they were called were made by one of three methods:
# painted on ivory, plaster, paper, card, or in reverse on glass;
# &quot;Hollow cut&quot; where the negative image was traced and then cut away from light colored paper which was then laid on a dark background; and
# &quot;cut and paste&quot; where the figure was cut out of dark paper (usually free hand) and then pasted onto a light background.

==History==
===Greek origins===
Pliny the Elder recounts the history of painting in books 34 and 35 of his &quot;Natural History&quot; (c. 77 CE). In book 35, chapter 5, he writes of silhouette as a starting point in the development of painting:

:&quot;We have no certain knowledge as to the commencement of the art of painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our consideration. The Egyptians assert that it was invented among themselves, six thousand years before it passed into Greece; a vain boast, it is very evident. As to the Greeks, some say that it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth; but they all agree that it originated in tracing lines round the human shadow [&quot;omnes umbra hominis lineis circumducta&quot;].&quot;

In chapter 15, he tells the story of Butades of Corinth as an originator of this modeling technique:

:&quot;Butades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who invented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth which he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that he made the discovery, who, being deeply in love with a young man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of his face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp [&quot;umbram ex facie eius ad lucernam in pariete lineis circumscripsit&quot;]. Upon seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery.&quot; 

Greek black-figure pottery painting, also known as the black-figure style or black-figure ceramic (Greek, μελανόμορφα, melanomorpha), common between the 7th and 5th centuries BCE, employs the silhouette and characteristic profile views of figures and objects on pottery forms. The pots themselves exhibit strong forms in outline that are indicators of their purpose, as well as being decorative.

===Profile portraits===
For the depiction of portraits, the profile image has marked advantage over a full-face image in many circumstances, because it depends strongly upon the proportions and relationship of the bony structures of the face (the forehead, nose and chin) making the image is clear and simple. For this reason, profile portraits have been employed on coinage since the Roman era. The early Renaissance period saw a fashion for painted profile portraits and people such as Federico da Montefeltro and Ludovico Sforza were depicted in profile portraits. The profile portrait is strongly linked to the silhouette.

Recent research at Stanford University indicates that where previous studies of face recognition have been based on frontal views, studies with silhouettes show humans are able to extract accurate information about gender and age from the silhouette alone. This is an important concept for artists who design characters for visual media, because the silhouette is the most immediately recognisable and identifiable shape of the character.

====Profile portrait techniques====

A silhouette portrait can be painted or drawn. However, the traditional method of creating silhouette portraits is to cut them from lightweight black cardboard and mount them on a pale (usually white) background. This was the work of specialist artists, often working out of booths at fairs or markets, whose trade competed with that of the more expensive miniaturists patronised by the wealthy.

A traditional silhouette portrait artist would cut the likeness of a person, freehand, within a few minutes. Some modern silhouette artists also make silhouette portraits from photographs of people taken in profile. These profile images are often head and shoulder length (bust) but can also be full length.
===Nineteenth-century popularity and development===


The work of the physiognomist Johann Caspar Lavater, who used silhouettes to analyse facial types, is thought to have promoted the art. The 18th century silhouette artist August Edouart cut thousands of portraits in duplicate. His subjects included French and British nobility and US presidents. Much of his personal collection was lost in a shipwreck. In England, the best known silhouette artist, a painter not a cutter, was John Miers, who travelled and worked in different cities, but had a studio on the Strand in London. He advertised &quot;three minute sittings&quot;, and the cost might be as low as half a crown around 1800. Miers&#x27; superior products could be in grisaille, with delicate highlights added in gold or yellow, and some examples might be painted on various backings, including gesso, glass or ivory. The size was normally small, with many designed to fit into a locket, but otherwise a bust some 3 to 5 inches high was typical, with half- or full-length portraits proportionately larger.

In America, silhouettes were highly popular from about 1790 to 1840.

The physionotrace apparatus invented by Frenchman Gilles-Louis Chrétien in 1783-84 facilitated the production of silhouette portraits by deploying the mechanics of the pantograph to transmit the tracing (via an eyepiece) of the subject&#x27;s profile silhouette to a needle moving on an engraving plate, from which multiple portrait copies could be printed. The invention of photography signaled the end of the silhouette as a widespread form of portraiture.

===Maintaining the tradition===

The skill was not lost, and travelling silhouette artists continued to work at state fairs into the 20th century. E. J. Perry and Dai Vernon were artists active in Coney Island at this time as well. The popularity of the silhouette portrait is being reborn in a new generation of people who appreciate the silhouette as a nostalgic way of capturing a significant occasion.

In the United States and the UK silhouette artists have websites advertising their services at weddings and other such functions. In England there is an active group of silhouette artists. In Australia, S. John Ross plied his scissors at agricultural shows for 60 years until his death in 2008. Other artists such as Douglas Carpenter produce silhouette images using pen and ink.

==In art, media and illustrations==

Since the late 18th century, silhouette artists have also made small scenes cut from card and mounted on a contrasting background like the portraits. These pictures, known as &quot;paper cuts&quot;, were often, but not necessarily, silhouette images. European paper cuts traditionally have differed from Asian paper cuts, which are often made of several layers of brightly coloured and patterned paper, with many formal decorative elements such as flower petals.

Among 19th century artists to work with papercutting was the author Hans Christian Andersen. The modern artist Robert Ryan creates intricate images by this technique, sometimes using them to produce silk-screen prints.

In the late 19th and early 20th century several illustrators employed designs of similar appearance for making book illustrations. Silhouette pictures could easily be printed by blocks that were cheaper to produce and longer lasting than detailed black and white illustrations.

Silhouette pictures sometimes appear in books of the early 20th century in conjunction with colour plates. (The colour plates were expensive to produce and each one was glued into the book by hand.) Illustrators who produced silhouette pictures at this time include Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson. In breaking with literal realism, artists of the Vorticist, Futurist and Cubist movements employed the silhouette. Illustrators of the late 20th century to work in silhouette include Jan Pienkowski and Jan Ormerod. In the early 1970s, French artist Philippe Derome uses the black cut silhouette in his portraits of black people. In the 21st century, American artist Kara Walker develops this use of silhouette to present racial issues in confronting images.

===Shadow theatre===

Originating in Asia with traditions such as the shadow theatres &quot;(wayang)&quot; of Indonesia, the shadow play became a popular entertainment in Paris during the 18th and 19th centuries. In late 19th-century Paris, shadow theatre was particularly associated with the cabaret Le Chat Noir, where Henri Rivière was the designer.
===Movies===
Since their pioneering use by Lotte Reiniger in silent films, silhouettes have been used for a variety of iconic, graphic, emotional, or conversely for distancing, effects in many movies. These include many of the opening credit sequences of the &quot;James Bond&quot; films. The opening sequence of the television series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; features a silhouetted profile of Alfred Hitchcock stepping into a caricatured outline of himself, and in his movie &quot;Psycho&quot;, the killer in the shower scene manifests as a terrifying silhouette. A scene from &quot;E.T.&quot; showing the central characters on a flying bicycle silhouetted against the full moon became a well-known movie poster. &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; contains an animated sequence in silhouette illustrating a short story &quot;The Tale of the Three Brothers&quot; that is embedded in the film. The sequence was produced by Ben Hibon for Framestore, with artwork by Alexis Lidell.

Silhouettes have also been used by recording artists in music videos. One example is the video for &quot;Buttons&quot; by The Pussycat Dolls, in which Nicole Scherzinger is seen in silhouette. Michael Jackson used his own distinctive silhouette both on stage and in videos such as &quot;You Rock My World&quot;. Early iPod commercials portrayed silhouetted dancers wearing an iPod and earbuds.

The cult television program, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; features the three main characters of the series watching a movie as silhouettes at the bottom of the screen.

===Architecture===

The discipline of architecture that studies the shadows cast by or upon buildings is called sciography.

The play of shadows upon buildings was very much in vogue a thousand years ago as evidenced by the surviving examples of &quot;muqarnas&quot; decoration, where the shadows of three-dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance of mosques form pictures. As outright pictures were avoided in Islam, tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, &quot;accidental&quot; silhouettes are a creative alternative.

===Photography===
Many photographers use the technique of photographing people, objects or landscape elements against the light, to achieve an image in silhouette. The background light might be natural, such as a cloudy or open sky, mist or fog, sunset or an open doorway (a technique known as contre-jour), or it might be contrived in a studio; see low-key lighting. Silhouetting requires that the exposure be adjusted so that there is no detail (underexposure) within the desired silhouette element, and overexposure for the background to render it bright; so, a lighting ratio of 16:1 or greater is the ideal. The Zone System was an aid to film photographers in achieving the required exposure ratios. High contrast film, adjustment of film development, and/or high contrast photographic paper may be used in chemical-based photography to enhance the effect in the darkroom. With digital processing the contrast may be enhanced through the manipulation of the contrast curve for the image.

====Photographic silhouettes====

===Graphic design===
In media the term &quot;to silhouette&quot; is used for the process of separating or masking a portion of an image (such as the background) so that it does not show. Traditionally silhouettes have often been used in advertising, particularly in poster design, because they can be cheaply and effectively printed.

==Other uses==
===Fashion and fitness===
The word &quot;silhouette&quot;, because it implies the outline of a form, has been used in both fashion and fitness to describe the outline shape of the body from a particular angle, as altered by clothing in fashion usage, and clothed or unclothed where fitness is concerned, (e.g. a usage applied here by the Powerhouse Museum). Advertising for both these fields urges people, women in particular, to achieve a particular appearance, either by corsetry, diet or exercise. The term was in use in advertising by the early 20th century. Many gyms and fitness studios use the word &quot;silhouette&quot; either in their name or in their advertising.

Historians of costume also use the term when describing the effect achieved by the clothes of different periods, so that they might describe and compare the silhouette of the 1860s with that of the other decades of the 19th century. A desirable silhouette could be influenced by many factors. The invention of crinoline steel influenced the silhouette of women in the 1850s and 60s. The posture of the Princess Alexandra influenced the silhouette of English women in the Edwardian period.

===Icons===
Because silhouettes give a very clear image, they are often used in any field where the speedy identification of an object is necessary. Silhouettes have many practical applications. They are used for traffic signs. They are used to identify towns or countries with silhouettes of monuments or maps. They are used to identify natural objects such as trees, insects and dinosaurs. They are used in forensic science.
===Journalism===
For interviews, some individuals choose to be videotaped in silhouette to mask their facial features and protect their anonymity, typically accompanied by a dubbed voice. This is done when the individuals may be endangered if it is known they were interviewed.
===Computer modelling===

Computer vision researchers have been able to build computational models for perception that are capable of generating and reconstructing 3D shapes from single or multi-view depth maps or silhouettes

===Business documents===
Silhouettes have also been used to create images that serve as business documents. Slave owners have had silhouettes made of the people they enslaved in order to document them as property and in order to accompany other business documents such as a bill of sale.

===Military and firearms===

Silhouettes of ships, planes, tanks, and other military vehicles are used by soldiers and sailors for learning to identify different craft.

<text>Caramon Majere (326 AC - 38 SC) is a fictional character from the Dragonlance books. He is depicted as a fighter and is one of the main characters in Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman&#x27;s first Dragonlance trilogy, the &quot;Dragonlance Chronicles&quot;. Caramon and his brother Raistlin Majere&#x27;s relationship was explored in the NY Times Best Seller &quot;Twins Trilogy&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;Dragon&quot; magazine published a series of stories introducing members of the Heroes of the Lance, to preview Dragonlance; the first of these was &quot;The Test of the Twins&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #83 (March 1984), a story featuring twin brothers Raistlin and Caramon.

==Character profile==
Caramon Majere was created by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman as one of several characters to be involved in an epic &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign which they had written and designed.

Raistlin Majere harbors a secret hate for his twin&#x27;s physical power and easygoing manner, and for the attention and comradeship it seems to earn him, as Raistlin&#x27;s own appearance and secretive nature causes others to be mistrustful and apprehensive. Caramon, conversely, holds Raistlin in high regard and tries to protect him.

== Early life ==
Caramon is the son of Gilon Majere and Rosamun Aelan Uth Matar, twin brother to Raistlin Majere, and half-brother to Kitiara Uth Matar.

The son of a woodcutter, Caramon&#x27;s childhood was a complicated one. Caramon (the first born), was strapping and healthy, while Raistlin was so sickly that the midwife feared he would die as an infant. Raistlin had to be nursed to health continuously by their half-sister, Kitiara. From an early age, Caramon&#x27;s deliberate way of considering ideas earned him a reputation for mental dullness. His father, Gilon, died in an accident when Caramon was only sixteen years old. Soon after, his mother, Rosamun, went into a delusional trance and never came out.

The novel &quot;Brothers Majere&quot; by Rose Estes explores how the love/hate relationship began between Caramon and Raistlin when Caramon allowed his mother to die to end her suffering from an illness. Caramon met Sturm Brightblade in his early teens; they did not get off to a good start. The two got into a fight because Sturm insulted Raistlin. Tasslehoff Burrfoot discovered the young boys and decided to &quot;adopt&quot; them. This is how Caramon met Flint Fireforge and Tanis Half-Elven. The six companions (seven with Kitiara) went on many treks as an entourage to Flint&#x27;s business. Soon, though, the companions decided to separate to find some truth to the rumors of war. Raistlin had other plans.

Raistlin was to undergo the Test of High Sorcery and Caramon accompanied him on this trip. During the Test, Raistlin killed an illusion of his twin, which Caramon witnessed. Their relationship has been strained since. The five years following this, the two brothers became mercenaries to learn how to combine magic and steel effectively and became a very lethal team in battle.

Caramon was the strongest of the Heroes of the Lance, and a fearsome warrior. He is over 6 ft. tall and massively built. He was trained in a battle craft by his half-sister Kitiara, who later became a Dragon Highlord in Takhisis&#x27; dragonarmies. Although they were complete opposites, Caramon was never far from his twin Raistlin. Much of Caramon&#x27;s experience in combat came from dealing with the charlatans and fakes whom Raistlin delighted in exposing and humiliating.

== War of the Lance and beyond ==

Caramon was one of the heroes who brought the War of the Lance to an end and was instrumental in the defeat of Takhisis and her Dragonarmies. He helped to defeat the evil dragon Khisanth in Xak Tsaroth and to free the slaves captured by Verminaard of Nidus in Pax Tharkas. He shared in the dream that all the Heroes of the Lance endured when several of the heroes (including Caramon) entered the realm of Silvanesti and found themselves trapped in the nightmare of Lorac, Speaker of the Stars.

Caramon was also a participant in the final battle at the Queen&#x27;s temple in Neraka when she was finally banished from Krynn. After the battle was won, Caramon was confronted by his brother Raistlin, who had now turned to the Black Robes. Caramon offered to walk the path of evil with his brother, but Raistlin refused, and left Caramon alone for the first time in his life. Despite this, Caramon remains loyal to his brother, with a willingness to provide aid at any time.

===Legends Trilogy===
&quot;Time of the Twins&quot;, the first novel in the series, features a self-contained narrative detailing the fall of Caramon and his redemption. He has become an alcoholic in the two years since the end of the first trilogy, and while Tasslehoff nudges Caramon into going after Raistlin, Caramon&#x27;s gradual recovery is entirely his own achievement.

After the War of the Lance was finished, Caramon married Tika Waylan and settled down to a quiet life in the town called Solace. However, without his brother, Caramon did not feel whole. At one point, Caramon wrote a heart-felt letter to his brother, which was returned to Caramon unopened, with the words &quot;I have no brother&quot; written on the outside of the envelope/scroll casing. Heartbroken, he soon turned to drinking to fill the emptiness. He becomes an overweight alcoholic and an embarrassment to his wife. His journey to redemption began when Caramon time travelled to the past with the cleric, Lady Crysania and Tasslehoff Burrfoot to the city of Istar on a mission to reclaim Raistlin from evil. Caramon became a gladiator in the Istarian arena and became the man he had once been, physically if not yet emotionally. Caramon then travelled forward in time one hundred years with Crysania and Raistlin (masquerading as Fistandantilus) to participate in the Dwarfgate Wars in &quot;War of the Twins&quot;.

Using a magical device, Caramon and Tasslehoff escaped that time period before a magical explosion could kill them and accidentally found themselves in an alternate future where Raistlin had succeeded in becoming a god, but had destroyed all life in the process. Caramon and Tasslehoff returned to the present at last where Caramon confronted his brother in the Abyss and told him what the future would be if his plans came to fruition. Raistlin realized his own mistake, and sacrificed his own life to correct his mistake and win his soul&#x27;s peace. Caramon escaped with Crysania back into the real world, having finally found the peace he sought.

===War of Souls===
After his long journey, Caramon returned to Solace to be with his wife. Together, they had five children: Sturm Majere, Tanin Majere, Palin Majere, Laura Majere and Dezra Majere. Caramon also later became a grandfather to Ulin Majere and Linsha Majere, son and daughter of his son Palin.

In the story &quot;Kitiara&#x27;s Son&quot; by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, Caramon is visited in the night by a blue dragon-rider named Sara Dunstan who is the adoptive mother of Steel Brightblade, the son of Sturm and Kitiara (making him Caramon&#x27;s half-nephew.) She begs Caramon to help turn Steel from evil before he becomes a full-fledged Knight of Takhisis. Together with Tanis Half-Elven, they kidnap Steel and tell him the truth about his father and his heroic sacrifice in the High Clerist&#x27;s Tower on behalf of the Knights of Solamnia and the world at large. Although Steel is not dissuaded from joining the evil Knights, this experience indelibly changes him.
He appears in a new adventure, &quot;Dezra&#x27;s Quest&quot; Released later in 2000, with his daughter Dezra Majere. 
He dies in the year 38 SC after a heart attack upon the stairs of the Inn of the Last Home, hoping to see his brother. Tasslehoff Burrfoot had traveled forward in time to an alternate timeline to speak at Caramon&#x27;s funeral, and told him that many people would be there and things were different. His soul joins the River of Souls where he is, at long last, reunited with his brother after Takhisis is defeated in the War of the Souls trilogy.

==Family tree==
==Other media==

===Video games===
Caramon appears as one of the player characters in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance&quot;.

Caramon also appears in &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;.

===Miniature figures===
Caramon was included in Ral Partha&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance Heroes&quot; boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine felt that Ral Partha successfully matched their figures to the descriptions of the characters in the novels, and described his figure: &quot;Caramon is leaning forward aggressively, as if fighting. He wields a long sword in his left hand with a shield on his right arm. A plate-mail suit covers his entire body, except for his full-length boots. His tunic, worn under his shoulder plates, flows naturally. The simple belts and buckles are clearly visible. Caramon wears a winged helmet, and his face bears a look of grim determination.&quot;

A second miniature of Caramon was released, this time on an individual blister pack, under Ral Partha&#x27;s &quot;Personalities&quot; line.

===&quot;Dragonlance&quot; movie===

Rino Romano voiced Caramon Majere in the animated movie &quot;&quot;. The 2002 winner of the American Library Association&#x27;s Alex Award Mel Odom reviewed the film and stated &quot;Caramon is simple-minded and protective of Raistlin&quot; without further characterisation although stating the movie was a &quot;lot of fun&quot;.

==Reception==
The character was popular enough for Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman to base the &quot;Twins Trilogy&quot; around Caramon&#x27;s and Raistlin&#x27;s relationship. The final book of the trilogy Test of the Twins appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for several weeks in 1986. Ian Hewitt, a staff reviewer from d20zines.com stated focus of the trilogy was &quot;Caramon&#x27;s heart-wrenching quest to save his brother if he can, but to ultimately stop him at any cost is the test that the twins must face&quot; and awarded Test of the Twins an A+ rating. In &quot;Religious Concepts in Fantasy Literature&quot;, Nadine Wolf wrote that while Caramon is the physically stronger twin compared to Raistlin, it is the latter who &quot;dominates their relationship&quot;. This is equivalent to what studies of real life twins has shown happens.

Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, calls the twin brothers Caramon and Raistlin &quot;the series most compelling characters&quot; and writes that &quot;Caramon is a large, powerful, goodhearted, slightly childlike warrior; Raistlin is a sickly, complicated, mysterious, morally iffy magician. The dynamic feels like it&#x27;s lifted straight from Thor and Loki, and that archetypal resonance is what Weis and Hickman are obviously shooting for. And almost entirely hit.&quot;

Lauren Davis of io9 notes that while &quot;Caramon is physically strong, but has invested so much of his life and identity in protecting brother that he&#x27;s blind to Raistlin&#x27;s growing darkness.&quot; Davis notes the flaws of the main characters, commenting that Caramon &quot;isn&#x27;t sure who he is without his brother—even in a crowded field of characters. That&#x27;s what lets us weep over doomed characters, shake our heads at foolish ones, rally at moments of true bravery and growth, and sigh over star-crossed lovers. Weis and Hickman may stuff their books with all a sorts of magical creatures and artifacts, but they clearly love their characters and never forget that it&#x27;s the human(ish) stories that form the series&#x27; heart.&quot;

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken commented that &quot;Raistlin&#x27;s twin brother. He&#x27;s strong, beefy, and not particularly bright. He does love Raistlin unequivocally, which is good because no one else does.&quot;

<doc id="959661" wikidata="Q7097605" url="?curid=959661" title="Operation Swift">
<text>Operation Swift was a military operation in the Vietnam War, launched by units of the U.S. 1st Marine Division to rescue two Marine companies which had been ambushed by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). The operation took place in the Quế Sơn Valley, beginning on 4 September 1967. In the ensuing battles, 127 Marines and an estimated 600 PAVN were killed.

==Background==
The Quế Sơn Valley is located along the border of Quảng Nam and Quảng Tín Provinces. During the Vietnam War it lay in the southern part of South Vietnam&#x27;s I Corps. Populous and rice-rich, the valley was viewed as one of the keys to controlling South Vietnam&#x27;s five northern provinces by the PAVN and by early 1967 at least two regiments of the PAVN 2nd Division had been infiltrated into the area. The Quế Sơn Valley was also recognized as strategically important by the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). The 5th Marine Regiment was assigned to the valley in 1967 to support the outnumbered Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces there.

In the spring and summer of 1967 the Marines launched Operations Union and Union II with the goal of sweeping the PAVN from the southern rim of the Quế Sơn Valley. Several bitter and costly battles forced the PAVN 2nd Division to cede control of area to the 5th Marines. Two Battalions of the 5th Marines continued to operate in the valley throughout the rest of the summer, but did not patrol aggressively and were not molested by the PAVN, who were regrouping. During the lull the PAVN 2nd Division rebuilt its strength to a force of three regular regiments and was reinforced by the Vietcong (VC) 1st Regiment, a full-time main force unit.

In early August Major General Donn J. Robertson, commanding the 1st Marine Division, turned his attention to the Quế Sơn Valley following several major operations around Da Nang. In an attempt to draw the PAVN into another destructive confrontation Robertson launched Operation Cochise on 11 August. However the PAVN largely managed to avoid contact with the three Marine battalions tasked with the operation which ended on 28 August with only modest results.

==Operation==
Sweep operations were then initiated to shield the local populace from intimidation during upcoming elections. Operation Swift, intended to be the fourth and the last of the 1967 operations in the Quế Sơn Valley, began unofficially on the morning of September 4 when Company D, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines was attacked before dawn by a superior PAVN force while in a night defensive perimeter next to the village of Dong Son.

The 1st Battalion Commander, Lt.Colonel Peter Hilgartner sent 1/5 Marines&#x27;s Company B, which was all he had at the time, to assist Company D. With Companies B and D heavily engaged, Companies K and M from the adjacent 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines were sent to relieve them. Ambushed and aggressively attacked, these two companies were also pinned down in separate enclaves by the early afternoon. During the fighting Corporal Larry Benjamin Nunez earned the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Squad Leader. Sergeant Lawrence Peters earned a posthumous Medal of Honor for leading his men in repulsing repeated attempts to overrun his position. Navy Chaplain Lieutenant Vincent R. Capodanno was also awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor for his efforts in pulling wounded men to safety in face of overwhelming enemy fire. Sergeant Thomas C. Panian was also awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism for organizing the defense of Company I, 3/5 Marines; and holding off subsequent attacks over 8 hours of combat.

Marine artillery fire and Marine jet fighter-bombers prevented the Marine infantry companies from being overrun. A Marine A-6 silenced an anti-aircraft gun emplacement, allowing more air support against PAVN positions, and a fresh Marine company launched a dawn counterattack on 5 September forcing the PAVN to break contact. With all engaged companies now relieved, Colonel Stanley Davis, commanding the 5th Marines, ordered 1/5 and 3/5 to pursue the withdrawing PAVN, this officially began Operation Swift. A search of the battlefield found 130 PAVN bodies, while Marine losses were 54 killed and 104 wounded.

In the early afternoon of 6 September, two battalions of the VC 1st Regiment attacked Company B, the lead company of the 1/5 Marines. Company B was isolated and nearly overrun, but held when Marine artillery rained tear gas around their position. Sergeant Rodney M. Davis, Platoon Guide of 2nd Platoon, Company B, purposely absorbed the force of a PAVN grenade to protect the lives of other Marines during that fight. Davis was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for this action. The PAVN withdrew at 02:00 leaving 61 dead, while Marine losses were 35 killed and 92 wounded.

The nearby 3/5 Marines was also heavily engaged a few hours later. Company I, dispatched to attack a hill held by the PAVN/VC, was isolated and nearly overrun by the VC 1st Regiment&#x27;s previously uncommitted 3rd Battalion. Company K fought through the VC and relieved Company I, but the two companies were then found to have too many casualties to move. Two determined night assaults by the VC were repulsed, and Company M eventually fought through against weakening opposition as the VC withdrew. Vietcong losses were 88 dead, while Marine losses were 34 killed and 109 wounded.

On the morning of 7 September, after a search of VC bodies revealed a map of the VC tactical locations, the Marines swept the area, uncovering a large supply cache.

On 10 September Company H, 2/5 Marines discovered an unoccupied bunker system, when another Marine platoon moved through the same village several hours later, they were hit by intense fire from the bunker now occupied by a PAVN force. Company H, 2/5 Marines and Company M, 3/5 Marines moved to support the pinned down platoon and with air and artillery support overran the PAVN position. The bodies of 40 PAVN were discovered, Marine losses were 9 dead. Several of the dead Marines were found with their jammed M-16s broken open for cleaning.

Also on 10 September the ARVN 37th Ranger Battalion encountered a PAVN force north of the Swift operational area. The Rangers lost 13 killed and 9 missing while the PAVN lost 70 killed.

In the early morning of 12 September, two PAVN Companies attacked Company I, 3/5 Marines&#x27; night defensive position, the attack was repulsed with 35 PAVN killed and 4 captured.

On the evening of 13 September the PAVN attacked the 37th Rangers again and additional ARVN units and 1/5 and 3/5 Marines were airlifted to support them. By dawn the PAVN disengaged leaving 49 dead while the Rangers has lost 15 killed.

==Aftermath==
The operation concluded on 15 September, by which time the PAVN 2nd Division and VC 1st Regiment had largely given up contesting the southern half of the Quế Sơn Valley. As Operation Swift concluded large U.S. Army units arrived in southern I Corps, allowing the 1st Marine Division to base a substantial force in the Quế Sơn Valley on a permanent basis. The area remained quiet from then until the Marines turned all of southern I Corps over to the U.S. Army at the beginning of 1968. U.S. intelligence agencies later determined that the two PAVN/VC regiments that had been most active during Operation Swift were subsequently unfit for combat.

<text>Sidney James Montford Atkinson (14 March 1901 – 31 August 1977) was a South African athlete, winner of 110 m hurdles at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

== Career ==
Atkinson came onto the international athletics scene in 1922, when he ran the 110 m hurdles in 15.2 and the 400 m hurdles in 56.5. He was also a notable long jumper.

Atkinson won the British AAA Championships title in the 120 yards hurdles event at the 1924 AAA Championships.

At the 1924 Summer Olympics, the favourite for the 110 m hurdles was American George Guthrie, but as the race started, Atkinson and another American Daniel Kinsey got off to a quick start and ran nearly together until the eighth flight when Atkinson edged ahead. Atkinson clipped his toe on the last barrier, giving Kinsey enough of lead to break the tape and win the gold. Guthrie crashed through the barriers behind the two medalists and was disqualified.

Atkinson won the British AAA Championships title in the 120 Yards hurdles event at the 1928 AAA Championships. Shortly afterwards he represented South Africa at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where he finally gained gold after the disappointment of 1924, beating the world record holder Steve Anderson from the United States into second place.

<text>Fresh 92.7 (formerly Fresh FM) is a community radio station broadcasting in Adelaide, South Australia. The station can be accessed on 92.7 FM and DAB+ digital radio in Adelaide, iHeartRadio and the Fresh 92.7 App.

Fresh Broadcasters Incorporated is the name of the incorporated body under which Fresh 92.7 sits and 5FBI is their call sign.

Fresh is overseen by a volunteer board of between six and ten professionals, runs on 12 staff, and is supported by over 100 volunteers (known as members) in a range of capacities. It employs professionals with extensive radio experience to guide the volunteer team and to ensure the station complies with license obligations. Fresh 92.7 relies on client sponsorship; Fresh Mate subscribers; revenue from the EDM Production Course, merchandise sales, and their Book-a-DJ service; grant funding; and donations as sources of revenue.

== History ==
Plans for Fresh 92.7 were laid when Chris Velliaris, James Engelman, and Geoff Wintle were visiting Melbourne in January 1997, and were exposed to Hitz FM, a youth radio station. They all agreed that Adelaide could benefit from a similar broadcasting concept. They formed a non-for-profit association and charter, and assembled a team of volunteers, including those with experience in various broadcasting professions.

Many of these volunteers had originally hosted specialist dance music shows on Coast FM 88.7.

Fresh commenced broadcasting with an Australian Broadcasting Authority &quot;Temporary Community Broadcaster&quot; licence on 17 March 1998. Initially the station broadcast at 92.9 MHz in a frequency-sharing agreement with the Italian language radio station Radio Televisione Italiana. They later moved to 92.7 MHz and on 22 August 2002, Fresh received a full-time broadcasting licence from the ABA. Then in October 2010, Fresh moved into new, state-of-the-art, digital studios in Adelaide&#x27;s fashionable East End.

On 19 February 2016, the University of Adelaide&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor Warren Bebbington announced that, in order to secure the future of Radio Adelaide as an independent not-for-profit organisation from July 2016, they had signed a deal with Fresh 92.7 that allowed Radio Adelaide to relocate and share their premises.

The two organisations continue to operate as two separate entities. Neither station&#x27;s programming is affected as part of the arrangement. In 2022, Radio Adelaide moved to new studios on Greenhill Road, just outside the CBD.

==Top 92==

The &quot;Top 92&quot; is an annual countdown of the most popular songs of the year, as voted by the listeners. It airs at the start of the year in January.

==Digital radio==
In mid-2011, Fresh 92.7 commenced broadcasting digital transmission.

<text>Graeme Norgate is a British video game music composer who has composed music for a variety of video games developed by Rare. His first project at Rare was writing music for the Game Boy game, &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot;. He also contributed to the soundtracks of &quot;Blast Corps&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. Norgate was later an employee of Free Radical Design, the company was eventually bought out by Crytek and renamed to Crytek UK; Norgate retained the position of audio director after the company&#x27;s buyout. Norgate later moved to Dambuster Studios after Crytek closed down Crytek UK.

Originally working at a bank before joining Rare in 1994, Norgate worked on the music of such games as &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Blast Corps&quot;. A friend of fellow Rare composer Robin Beanland, the two worked on the original soundtrack to &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; in the 1990s. He also composed music (but was not fully credited) for other Rareware games such as &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;.

Norgate played synthesizer and programmed drums for the bands &#x27;FWNT&#x27; and &#x27;The Catch&#x27; between 1991 and 1992. He also works under the alias of Virez when remixing, he has remixed several songs for bands such as Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Goteki, Code 64, Seize and Illumina.

<doc id="959674" wikidata="Q972329" url="?curid=959674" title="David Wise (composer)">
<text>David Wise is a British video game music composer and musician. He was a composer at Rare from 1985 to 2009, and he was the company&#x27;s sole musician up until 1994. He has gained a dedicated following for his work on various games, particularly Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series. Wise is known for his atmospheric style of music, mixing natural environmental sounds with prominent melodic and percussive accompaniment.

==Career and influences==
Wise has said that he has had a wide range of musical influences. The first instrument he learned to play was the piano, before later learning the trumpet, and learning to play the drums during adolescence. He played in a few bands during his youth, and he was active in a band as of 2004. His career at Rare began when he happened to meet its two founders; as he explained in response to a question posted on its company website: &quot;I was working in a music shop demonstrating a Yamaha CX5 Music Computer to a couple of people, Tim &amp; Chris Stamper. I&#x27;d written and programmed the music for the demonstration material. They offered me a job.&quot;

While working at Rare, Wise gained attention and acclaim for his work on the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series. In addition to the percussive and ambient &#x27;jungle&#x27; influences that serve as a thematic undercurrent for much of the series, the games feature a wide variety of different musical styles that are reflective of the various areas and environments they appear in. In the January 1996 issue of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, Wise stated that his travelling experiences largely shaped the sound and mood of each &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; soundtrack, further saying that the music for &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; was composed during what he called his &quot;experimental Paris phase&quot;. In the book &quot;Playing With Super Power&quot;, some influences for the music of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; were mentioned. Specifically, Koji Kondo&#x27;s work on the &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series; the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game &quot;Plok&quot;, composed by Tim Follin and Geoff Follin; and synthesized film scores and rock and dance music from the early 1980s. He has composed the soundtrack for the Game Boy Advance port of &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot;.

In October 2009, it was announced by the OverClocked ReMix community that Wise was remixing a track for &quot;Serious Monkey Business&quot;, an unofficial &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot; remix album. Grant Kirkhope and Robin Beanland collaborated on this track, playing guitar and trumpet respectively. On 15 March 2010, &quot;Serious Monkey Business&quot; was released and Wise&#x27;s track, &quot;Re-Skewed&quot;, was featured as track No. 33. Much like his contribution to &quot;Serious Monkey Business&quot;, Wise later remixed his own composition, the GBA version of &quot;Jungle Jitter&quot;, for an unofficial &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3&quot; remix album titled &quot;Double the Trouble!&quot;, which was released on 1 December 2012. Wise also provided a saxophone solo for another remix, in addition to mixing and mastering the track.

On 14 November 2009, Wise announced his resignation from Rare, feeling that the company had &quot;changed a great deal&quot; and there was no longer an opportunity to create music tracks that Rare is most known for. In December 2010 Wise created a personal studio called the &#x27;David Wise Sound Studio&#x27;. In June 2013, it was announced that he would be composing for &quot;Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze&quot;, after receiving a call from Retro Studios president Michael Kelbaugh, who previously worked at Rare. Wise composed for &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; along with Kirkhope and Steve Burke.

<text>The Doctor is the protagonist of the long-running BBC science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. An extraterrestrial Time Lord, the Doctor travels the universe in a time travelling spaceship called the TARDIS, often with companions. Since the show&#x27;s inception in 1963, the character has been portrayed by fourteen lead actors. The transition to each succeeding actor is explained within the show&#x27;s narrative through the plot device of regeneration, a biological function of Time Lords that allows a change of cellular structure and appearance with recovery following a mortal injury.

A number of other actors have played the character in stage and audio plays, as well as in various film and television productions. The Doctor has also been featured in films and a vast range of spin-off novels, audio dramas and comic strips.

Ncuti Gatwa has portrayed the Fifteenth Doctor since &quot;The Giggle&quot; (2023).

==Character biography==
Within the fictional narrative, the Doctor is a Time Lord who travels through time and space in a dimensionally transcendental – &quot;bigger on the inside&quot; – time machine: the TARDIS. This time machine, whose name is an acronym for &quot;Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space&quot;, takes the exterior form of a 1963 police telephone call box and retains the appearance throughout the programme. Human companions accompany the Doctor through their adventures and serve as audience surrogate characters to ask questions which allow the Doctor to provide relevant exposition.

&quot;Doctor&quot; is a self-selected alias. In episodes specifically under showrunner Steven Moffat, the story arcs surrounding events in the Doctor&#x27;s future implied serious consequences in the event of the Doctor&#x27;s true name being spoken, with the nature of these finally revealed in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;. Spin-off media offer the explanation that the Doctor&#x27;s true name is unpronounceable by humans. In &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor tells companion Clara Oswald that the name &quot;Doctor&quot; is essentially a promise he made. The promise itself is revealed in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;: &quot;Never cruel nor cowardly. Never give up. Never give in.&quot;

===Early life===
The episode &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; revised the Doctor&#x27;s origins, revealing a scientist and space explorer named Tecteun who found a lone, mysterious child with a supernatural physiology – one not belonging to any other life form or species – and an immense intelligence. She adopted the child and studied her, successfully grafting her regeneration capacity (and possibly other traits) into her own species, the Shobogans, and herself. This species, who would eventually become the Time Lords, was restricted to a limit of twelve regenerations by a later incarnation of Tecteun. Tecteun and their child were eventually inducted into a clandestine Time Lord organisation known as the Division. After an unknown amount of regenerations, Tecteun&#x27;s child began calling themself &quot;Doctor&quot;. The Fugitive Doctor, true to her title, was on the run from the Division in a TARDIS disguised as a police box. The details of their life were also redacted from the Matrix – only snippets remaining, masked as the story of the Irish Garda Brendan. The true origins of the Time Lords remained hidden from themselves and from the Doctor.

The First Doctor&#x27;s subsequent childhood on Gallifrey has been little described in the series. In &quot;Hell Bent&quot; the Doctor recalled his origins as a high-born Gallifreyan. In &quot;The Time Monster&quot;, the Doctor says he grew up in a house on a mountainside and talks about a hermit who lived under a tree behind the house and inspired the Doctor when he was depressed. He is later reunited with this former mentor, now on Earth posing as the abbot K&#x27;anpo Rimpoche, in &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;. In &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;, according to Madame de Pompadour who psychically linked with the Doctor&#x27;s memories, the Doctor experienced a very lonely childhood. An elderly woman on Gallifrey died and was shrouded in veils and surrounded by flies, giving the Doctor recurring nightmares, which the confession dial in &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; would later visualise to torment him. In &quot;Listen&quot;, it is ambiguously revealed the Doctor as a child often slept alone in a barn in the Drylands (a desert region outside the city capital), was withdrawn from other children, and was cared for by guardian figures who privately doubted the child&#x27;s ability as an eventual Time Lord. Through the dialogue, it is suggested that several Gallifreyan children were pressured into joining the army, a path which did not sit right with the Doctor&#x27;s pacifist beliefs, and as a result he wished to enroll into the Time Lord Academy instead.

The classic series refers to his time at the academy and his affiliation with the notoriously devious Prydonian chapter of Time Lords. In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;, the Doctor describes an academy initiation where, at the age of eight, Gallifreyan children were taken from their families and made to look into the Untempered Schism, a gap in the fabric of reality, to view the Time Vortex. According to the Doctor, when regarding the effects of the initiation on participants: &quot;Some would be inspired, some would run away and some would go mad (as he suggests happened to his nemesis, the Master).&quot; When asked to which group he belonged, he replied, &quot;Oh, the ones that ran away. I never stopped!&quot; The Doctor was taught by future Lord President Borusa and Azmael, where he met Drax, with whom he attended a Tech course as part of the class of &#x27;92. In &quot;the Armageddon Factor&quot;, it is revealed that the Doctor scraped through the academy with 51% on his second attempt. In &quot;The Time Meddler&quot;, it is said that the Doctor was fifty years before the Meddling Monk. In &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, the Doctor claims to have attended university alongside the Rani, specialising in thermodynamics.

At the academy, he met his childhood friend the Master and the pair grew up together. In &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the Master recollects their childhood together where they would run all day across his father&#x27;s field, described as &#x27;pastures of red grass stretching far across the slopes of Mount Perdition&#x27; and the boys would call up at the sky. In &quot;World Enough and Time&quot;, the Doctor claims that they both made a special pact where together they would visit every star in the universe; however, the Master was &#x27;too busy burning them&#x27;. In &quot;Hell Bent&quot;, one day at the academy, the Doctor found himself lost inside the Cloisters (an area located deep beneath the citadel) and spent four days inside. He was contacted by a Wraith who told him about the prophecy of a legendary creature known as &#x27;the Hybrid&#x27;, prophesied to have been crossbred from two warrior races that would stand in the ruins of Gallifrey, unravel the Web of Time and burn a billion hearts to heal its own. The Wraiths then revealed to him the secret passage leading to another side of the city. The last anyone heard from him was that he apparently stole the moon and the President&#x27;s wife; however, this was revealed to have been a lie spread about by the Shobogans when in reality it was the President&#x27;s daughter and he lost the moon. This event had a massive impact on the Doctor, who theorized that he himself was possibly the Hybrid. This is one reason the Doctor has stated as to why he decided to leave Gallifrey – out of fear. He has given convoluted and contradictory reasons as to why he left, for many reasons such as because his life path was pre-determined from his hidden previous life.

The Doctor stole a TARDIS with his granddaughter Susan from a repair shop on Gallifrey. In later episodes, the Doctor mentions that he once took a driving test to pilot a TARDIS and failed, and that he threw the instruction manual in a supernova because he disagreed with it. In &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, Idris (the TARDIS&#x27;s living soul in a human body) mentions that the Doctor had been travelling with her for 700 years, which indicates that he would have been 200 years old when he first borrowed her. In &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, it is revealed that the Doctor also left to investigate the mystery of why good prevails in a universe where evil would seem to have so many advantages. It would be after his encounter with the Twelfth Doctor that the First Doctor realised that his actions made the difference in the balance between good and evil, with the Twelfth Doctor stating &quot;The universe generally fails to be a fairy tale, but that&#x27;s where we come in.&quot;

In other media, more has been revealed of the Doctor&#x27;s early life. In the &quot;Past Doctor Adventures&quot; novel &quot;Divided Loyalties&quot;, the Doctor recalls his Academy years in a dream induced by the Celestial Toymaker. According to this, he was a member of an organisation called the Deca, ten brilliant Academy students campaigning for increased Time Lord intervention, alongside Mortimus (the Meddling Monk), Ushas (the Rani), Koschei (the Master), Magnus (the War Chief), Drax, a spy named Vansell, Millennia, Rallon and Jelpax. With this group, he learns about the Celestial Toymaker and travels to his realm in a type 18 TARDIS with Deca members Rallon and Millennia, who are killed. This leads to the Doctor&#x27;s expulsion from the academy, condemned to five hundred years in Records and Traffic Control. In &quot;The Quantum Archangel&quot;, it is revealed the Doctor studied cosmic science alongside the Master, taught by Cardinal Sendok. In the Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;Goth Opera&quot;, it is said the Doctor was a frequent prankster while at the academy, introducing cats into Gallifrey&#x27;s ecosystem with his friend Ruath and electrifying a &quot;perigosto stick&quot; belonging to his teacher, Borusa.

Feeling that too much of the Doctor&#x27;s backstory had been revealed by the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s era, writers Andrew Cartmel, Ben Aaronovitch and Marc Platt developed a new direction for the series. Cartmel wished to restore the character&#x27;s &quot;awe, mystery and strength&quot; and make him &quot;once again more than a mere chump of a Time Lord&quot; – an idea the media dubbed the &quot;Cartmel Masterplan&quot;. Under Cartmel, the show foreshadowed this concept; however, its 1989 cancellation meant that it was never realised onscreen. The proposed backstory was fully explored in Platt&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot;, where the Doctor is revealed as &quot;the Other&quot;, a mysterious figure in Gallifreyan lore who co-founded Time Lord society with Rassilon and Omega. After a curse renders Gallifrey sterile, the Other devises biotechnological looms to &quot;weave&quot; new Time Lords; his granddaughter Susan is Gallifrey&#x27;s last natural child. To escape a civil war with Rassilon, the Other throws himself into the loom system, where he is disintegrated and later woven into the Doctor. The Timeless Child reveal partly took inspiration from this.

===Family===
The Doctor&#x27;s adoptive mother Tecteun was a native to Gallifrey and an explorer of the Shobogans. She adopted the Doctor when she was the timeless child. She led the Division after the destruction of Gallifrey by the Spy Master. She was involved in the creation of the Flux and was the one to release Swarm from imprisonment as part of the Division&#x27;s plan to destroy the universe. She was disintegrated by Swarm shortly after briefly confronting the Thirteenth Doctor after she found out her true origins as the timeless child.

Other than Tecteun and Susan Foreman, his granddaughter with whom he travelled during the first two seasons and who has been mentioned occasionally since, references to the Doctor&#x27;s other families (adopted or not) are rare in the programme. In &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, when asked about his family, the Second Doctor says his memories of them are alive when he wants them to be; otherwise they sleep in his mind and he forgets. In &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot;, when asked if he has family, the Seventh Doctor replies that he does not know. In the 1996 television movie, the Eighth Doctor remarks that he is half-human on his mother&#x27;s side, and recalls watching a meteor storm with his father on Gallifrey. The revived series never addresses a human mother again and at times even contradicted this remark: The half-human clone of the Tenth Doctor is initially disgusted to be half-human (&quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;) and the Twelfth Doctor rejects that he could be a hybrid of human and Time Lord (&quot;Hell Bent&quot;). The Doctor mentions having had a brother in &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;, and sisters in &quot;Arachnids in the UK&quot;. In &quot;It Takes You Away&quot;, the Thirteenth Doctor claims that she had seven grandmothers. Later in the same scene, she mentions that her favourite grandmother, Granny 5, alleged Granny 2 was &quot;a secret agent for the Zygons&quot;.

Throughout the revival, the Doctor routinely attempts to change the topic when questioned about being a parent or his family life, as in &quot;Fear Her&quot;, &quot;The Beast Below&quot; and &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;. In &quot;The Empty Child&quot;, a hospital doctor named Dr. Constantine says to him, &quot;Before this war began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I&#x27;m neither. But I&#x27;m still a doctor.&quot; The Ninth Doctor&#x27;s reply is, &quot;Yeah. I know the feeling.&quot; In &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, when discussing the topic of parenthood, the Tenth Doctor confirms that he had at one point been a father and that he lost his children &quot;a long time ago&quot;, saying &quot;When they died that part of me died with them&quot;; the nature of their deaths, however, has never been explained, as it is suggested that whatever happened to his family is very painful for the Doctor to talk about. In &quot;The Woman Who Fell to Earth&quot; when the Thirteenth Doctor is questioned how she copes with the loss of her family, she states that she carries the memories of them with her and thus makes them a part of who she is, saying &quot;even though they&#x27;re gone from the world ... they&#x27;re never gone from me.&quot;

In &quot;The End of Time&quot;, a mysterious individual, referred to in the episode credits as &quot;The Woman&quot;, appears unexpectedly to Wilfred Mott throughout both episodes. She is later revealed to be a dissident Time Lady, who opposed the Time Lord High Council&#x27;s plan to escape the Time War. When she reveals her face to the Doctor, his reaction indicates that he recognises her. Julie Gardner, in the episode&#x27;s commentary, states that while some have speculated that the Time Lady is the Doctor&#x27;s mother, neither she nor Russell T. Davies is willing to comment on her identity. When later asked by Wilfred who she was, the Doctor evades answering the question, making their connection unclear. In &quot;Doctor Who: The Writer&#x27;s Tale – The Final Chapter&quot;, Russell T Davies states that the character was conceived as the Doctor&#x27;s mother, but her identity was left ambiguous to allow viewers to make up their own minds.

In spin-off media, several individuals related to the Doctor have made appearances, and do not appear in the television series, such as his grandchildren John and Gillian, who appeared alongside the First and Second Doctors in comics and annuals. Two different, conflicting accounts exist on the descendants of Susan after leaving the Doctor. In the audio play &quot;An Earthly Child&quot;, it is revealed that Susan has had a half-human child, Alex Campbell, the Doctor&#x27;s great-grandson. Alternatively, in the novel &quot;Legacy of the Daleks&quot;, Susan and her husband David adopt three children whom they name David Campbell Jr, Ian and Barbara; named after David himself, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, respectively. Irving Braxiatel, a character first introduced in the novel &quot;Theatre of War&quot;, was initially hinted at, and later confirmed to be, the Doctor&#x27;s biological older brother. He has since become a recurring character, especially within the Big Finish spin-off audio series &quot;Gallifrey&quot; and &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot;.

In the novel &quot;Father Time,&quot; the Eighth Doctor, during his hundred-year exile on Earth, found an orphaned Time Lord girl named Miranda whom he adopted and raised until she was 16. In the novel &quot;Sometime Never...&quot;, she returned to the Doctor with her daughter Zezanne. She was also the central character in a three-issue comic book series published by Comeuppance Comics in 2003. Author Lance Parkin, who devised the character of Miranda, has hinted that her real father is a future incarnation of the Doctor which, if so, would make Zezanne the Doctor&#x27;s biological granddaughter as well. The Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; presents an alternative take on the Doctor&#x27;s origins, suggesting that Time Lords are &quot;loomed&quot; in large batches of &quot;cousins&quot; and not produced via sexual reproduction. &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; portrays the Doctor as one of 45 cousins grown from his house&#x27;s genetic loom as an adult. By contrast, the TV programme has shown Time Lords as children and stated that Time Lords can have sexual relationships.

The Doctor is assumed to be or to have been married to Susan&#x27;s grandmother, including by head writer Steven Moffat. In &quot;Blink&quot;, the Doctor mentioned that he was rubbish at his own wedding. In The Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Cold Fusion&quot;, a Time Lord lady named Patience who was the widow of Omega, one of the founding-fathers of Gallifreyan society who fell into an anti-matter universe. Patience later met and married the Doctor and together they had thirteen children. Once their first-born son announced the arrival of a baby, the family was targeted by the Lord President, as the child was to be conceived naturally and only the Loom-born could inherit the Legacy of Rassilon; as a result, the Doctor&#x27;s children were systemically culled. The Doctor managed to help Patience escape through the use of the Machine, a prototype TARDIS, after assuring that her daughter-in-law had given birth to a girl named Susan and promised that he would keep the child safely away from Gallifrey.

In &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, the Doctor marries recurring companion and love interest River Song. Comments by both River and the Doctor in the seventh series, particularly in &quot;The Angels Take Manhattan&quot;, confirmed that they were married; in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, the Doctor refers to her as his &quot;wife&quot; after seeing a grave stone with her name on it, after initially answering &quot;yes&quot; when Clara asks if she was an &quot;ex&quot;.

In &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the Tenth Doctor mentions marrying Queen Elizabeth I and implies that they had sex, stating: &quot;her nickname is no longer [the Virgin Queen]...&quot;. The joke continues in &quot;The Beast Below&quot;, featuring future British monarch Queen Elizabeth X or Liz Ten, and the marriage is finally shown in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; during an adventure with Zygons. In the 2010 Christmas special, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor accidentally marries Marilyn Monroe but later questions the authenticity of the chapel in which they were married. Steven Moffat did not consider the marriages to Elizabeth I and Marilyn Monroe to count when questioned on how many wives the Doctor had had, remarking that he was married to Susan&#x27;s grandmother and River Song.

===An Adventure in Time and Space===
An adventurous scientist, the Doctor usually solves problems with his wits rather than with force. With the exception of his sonic screwdriver (which cannot kill, wound or maim), the Doctor detests weapons and uses violence only as a last resort. According to the alien villain Chedaki in the episode &quot;The Android Invasion,&quot; &quot;his entire history is one of opposition to conquest&quot;.

As a time traveller, the Doctor has been present at, or directly involved in, countless major historical events on the planet Earth and elsewhere – sometimes more than once. In the 2005 series premiere, &quot;Rose&quot;, it is revealed that the Ninth Doctor was instrumental in preventing a family from boarding the &quot;Titanic&quot; prior to her fateful voyage. In &quot;The End of the World&quot;, the Doctor recalls having been on board and surviving the &quot;Titanic&#x27;s&quot; sinking to find himself &quot;clinging to an iceberg&quot;. The Fourth Doctor mentioned this event in &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;, where he insists that the sinking was not his fault; the Seventh Doctor became involved in the sinking when tracking an alien entity in the novel &quot;The Left-Handed Hummingbird&quot;. The Doctor has also encountered many of Earth&#x27;s historical figures.

It is his tendency for becoming &quot;involved&quot; with the universe – in direct violation of official Time Lord policy – that has caused the Doctor to be labelled a renegade by the Time Lords as stated in &quot;The War Games.&quot; However, the Doctor&#x27;s actions are largely tolerated as he saved Gallifrey and the universe several times. The Time Lords are partial to sending him on missions when deniability or expendability is needed, implied to have begun after his capture during &quot;The War Games&quot; and witnessed further in later stories, the Time Lords directing the Doctor and/or the TARDIS to specific locations in &quot;Colony in Space&quot;, &quot;The Curse of Peladon&quot;, &quot;The Mutants&quot;, &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;. The Doctor&#x27;s standing in Time Lord society has waxed and waned over the years, from being a hunted man who was eventually punished with a forced regeneration and an exile sentence on Earth, to being appointed Lord President of the High Council. He does not assume the office for very long, fleeing Gallifrey after his appointment rather than accepting the limitations on his freedom that the role would place on him (&quot;The Five Doctors&quot;), and is eventually deposed &quot;in absentia&quot; (&quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;). By the time of his twelfth incarnation, he is regarded by many Gallifreyans as a war hero, &quot;the man who won the Time War&quot; (&quot;Hell Bent&quot;).

===The Time War===
In the first series of the 2005 revival, writer Russell T Davies introduced the concept of the Time War to streamline the Doctor&#x27;s backstory for new viewers of the show. It was a war across all of time and space which ended when the Doctor presumably destroyed both the Time Lords and the Daleks. The Doctor&#x27;s remorse for his actions in his Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh incarnations is a key part of his characterisation throughout the revival. The Time War happened between the 1996 television movie and 2005 opening episode &quot;Rose&quot; according to the show&#x27;s internal chronology, although the events of past serials such as &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; have been retroactively attributed to the Time War. It was never shown on-screen until &quot;The End of Time&quot;, which was both Davies&#x27; last story as head writer and producer and David Tennant&#x27;s last regular story as the Tenth Doctor. This episode featured brief views of Gallifrey and the Time Lords on the last day of the Time War.

The 2013 mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;, released as a prelude to the 50th anniversary special, featured Paul McGann reprising his role as the Eighth Doctor and was set during the Last Great Time War, albeit much earlier than during &quot;The End of Time&quot;. The mini-episode presented him as a conscientious objector to the war who regenerated under controlled circumstances into the War Doctor (John Hurt), a previously unseen incarnation created retroactively by Steven Moffat, Davies&#x27; successor as head writer, for the 50th anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;. The Tenth and Eleventh Doctors explained that Hurt&#x27;s regeneration was not the Doctor because his actions during the Time War were a betrayal of the promise that name symbolized. &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; revisited the last day of the Time War after &quot;The End of Time&quot; and revealed that the interference of the future Doctors and future companion Clara Oswald caused the War Doctor to change his plan at the last moment. Ultimately, Gallifrey was hidden in a parallel dimension and the Daleks destroyed themselves in the ensuing crossfire; to all observers, it appeared as though the two races had been annihilated together. The unsynchronized timestreams caused the War Doctor to forget the specifics of his actions at this time. The Doctor remembered committing the apparent genocide during the lives of his ninth, tenth and eleventh incarnations up until the time of the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s present.

==Development==
The character of the Doctor was created by BBC Head of Drama, Sydney Newman. The first format document for the programme that was to become &quot;Doctor Who&quot; – then provisionally titled &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot; – was written in March 1963 by C. E. Webber, a staff writer who had been brought in to help develop the project. Webber&#x27;s document contained a main character described as &quot;The maturer man, 35–40, with some &#x27;character twist&#x27;.&quot; Newman was not keen on this idea and – along with several other changes to Webber&#x27;s initial format – created an alternative lead character named Dr Who, a crotchety older man piloting a stolen time machine, on the run from his own far-future world. No written record of Newman&#x27;s conveyance of these ideas – believed to have taken place in April 1963 – exists, and the character of Dr Who first begins appearing in existing documentation from May of that year. It is possible that series co-creator Donald Wilson may have named the character; in a 1971 interview Wilson claimed to have come up with the series&#x27; title, and when this claim was put to Newman he did not dispute it.

The character was first portrayed by William Hartnell in 1963. At the programme&#x27;s beginning, nothing at all is known of the Doctor: not even his name, the actual form of which remains a mystery. In the first serial, &quot;An Unearthly Child,&quot; two teachers from Coal Hill School in London, Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton, become intrigued by one of their pupils, Susan Foreman, who exhibits high intelligence and unusually advanced knowledge. Trailing her to a junkyard at 76 Totter&#x27;s Lane, they encounter a strange old man and hear Susan&#x27;s voice coming from inside what appears to be a police box. Pushing their way inside, the two find that the exterior is camouflage for the dimensionally transcendental interior of the TARDIS. The old man, whom Susan calls &quot;Grandfather&quot;, kidnaps Barbara and Ian to prevent them from telling anyone about the existence of the TARDIS, taking them on an adventure in time and space. The first Doctor, says cultural scholar John Paul Green, &quot;explicitly positioned the Doctor as grandfather to his companion Susan&quot;. He wore long white hair and Edwardian costume, reflecting, Green says, a &quot;definite sense of Englishness&quot;.

When Hartnell left the programme after three years due to ill health, the role was handed over to character actor Patrick Troughton. , official television productions have depicted fourteen distinct incarnations of the Doctor. The longest-lasting on-screen incarnation is the Fourth Doctor, played by Tom Baker for seven years. Within the narrative, these changes were explained as regeneration, a biological process which heals a Time Lord when their incarnation is about to die. Consequently, the Time Lord is given a wholly new body. In &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;, the concept of a regeneration limit is introduced, giving Time Lords a fixed number of twelve regenerations, meaning that every Time Lord had a total of thirteen incarnations including the original. The plot of &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; involves the Doctor receiving a new cycle of regenerations from the Time Lords before his expected demise, triggering the regeneration into the Twelfth Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi.

The origins of the programme were explored in the docudrama &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot; as part of the 50th-anniversary celebrations of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which starred David Bradley as William Hartnell.

==Physiology==
Although Time Lords resemble humans, their physiology differs in key respects. Like other members of their race, the Doctor has two hearts (binary vascular system), a &quot;respiratory bypass system&quot; that allows the Doctor to go without air, an internal body temperature of 15–16 °C (60 °F) and occasionally exhibits a super-human level of stamina and the ability to absorb, withstand and expel large amounts of certain types of radiation. (The Tenth Doctor stated they used to play with Röntgen bricks in the nursery, after absorbing the radiation from an x-ray of significantly magnified power.) This ability seems to have limitations which have yet to be fully explained, as the Doctor &quot;is&quot; harmed by radiation in &quot;The Daleks&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; and &quot;The End of Time&quot;. The Doctor has withstood, with minimal damage, exposure to electricity deadly enough to kill a human (&quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot;, &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;Aliens of London&quot;, &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Idiot&#x27;s Lantern&quot;, &quot;Evolution of the Daleks&quot; and spin-off audio &quot;Spare Parts&quot;). Certain stories imply that the Time Lord is resistant to cold temperatures (&quot;42&quot;). To counter extreme trauma, such as exposure to the poisonous fungus in &quot;The Seeds of Death&quot; and after being shot in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, the Doctor can go into a self-induced coma until they recover. The Doctor&#x27;s hypersensitive body and senses enable them to detect anomalies humans cannot, such as identifying alien species, blood type or chemical composition by taste and determining location or time period by sniffing the air. In &quot;The Unicorn and the Wasp&quot; (2008) he was able to sense the changes in his body&#x27;s enzymes (i.e. cyanide poisoning) and expel the cyanide from his body by ingesting a concoction of ginger beer, protein foods and salts.

The Doctor has shown a resistance to temporal effects and has demonstrated telepathic ability, both the ability to mentally connect to other incarnations of themselves they have encountered (&quot;The Five Doctors&quot;), and an ability to enter into the memories of other individuals (&quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;). The Doctor can apparently reverse this process, sharing their memory with another, as shown in &quot;The Lodger&quot;. Some humans can enter the Doctor&#x27;s memories after the Doctor enters theirs, as demonstrated by Madame de Pompadour (much to the Doctor&#x27;s surprise) in &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;, when she explains, &quot;A door, once opened, may be stepped through in either direction.&quot; In &quot;The Fires of Pompeii&quot;, the Doctor reveals that he is able to perceive the fabric of time, discerning &quot;fixed points&quot; and &quot;points in flux&quot; – moments when history must remain as it was originally versus moments when he can change or influence the original course of events, as well as all past, present and possible future events. However, in &quot;Kill the Moon&quot;, the Twelfth Doctor claims that there are &quot;grey areas&quot;, points in time for which he cannot see the outcome. Like many other alien species in the programme, the Doctor is able to sense when their own species is within proximity through an inherent telepathic connection.

The Doctor exhibits some weaknesses uncommon to humans. For example, according to &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot; (1971), a tablet of aspirin could kill him. In &quot;Cold Blood&quot;, a process meant to decontaminate him of bacteria from the surface of Earth causes him intense pain, and he says it could have killed him if allowed to proceed to completion. In the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Adventuress of Henrietta Street&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s second heart was surgically removed, resulting in the loss of his abilities to metabolise drugs and go without air; these are restored when he begins to grow a new heart after his old one &#x27;dies&#x27; (&quot;Camera Obscura&quot;).

In his final serial, the Second Doctor states that Time Lords can live forever, &quot;barring accidents&quot;. When &quot;accidents&quot; do occur, Time Lords can usually regenerate into a new body. It is stated in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; that Time Lords can only regenerate a total of twelve times, giving a theoretical final total of thirteen incarnations. However, The Doctor has a natural ability to regenerate an infinite number of times. It is possible to exceed this limit: in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; the Time Lords offer the Master, who is inhabiting a Trakenite body after exhausting his original twelve regenerations, a new regeneration cycle as a reward for his help and cooperation, and at some point, during the Time War they resurrected him, with his new body having at least one regeneration of its own. Regeneration is apparently optional, as in &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; the Master refuses to regenerate despite the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s pleading. In addition, there are ways of killing a Time Lord that do not permit regeneration; for example, more than once it has been implied that stopping both the Doctor&#x27;s hearts simultaneously would accomplish this (as demonstrated in the Eleventh Doctor story &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot;). The Chancellery Guard (Gallifrey&#x27;s equivalent of a police force) are armed with stasers, weapons capable of suppressing regeneration. In &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, a serial from spin-off programme &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor flippantly responds to Clyde Langer that he can regenerate &quot;507&quot; times; writer Russell T. Davies intended this line as a joke. Due to the retroactive creation of a numberless War Doctor and the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s aborted regeneration in &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;/&quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor was the final incarnation in his natural cycle. The Time Lords used a crack in the universe to give him a new cycle consisting of an unknown number of regenerations in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, triggering the regeneration into the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi). The Twelfth Doctor later claims to be uncertain he &quot;won&#x27;t keep regenerating forever&quot; (&quot;Kill the Moon&quot;), and even Rassilon, the president of the Time Lords, expresses uncertainty about how many regenerations the Doctor has available to him.

Other skills include his mental communication with other Time Lords, in some cases over a galaxy&#x27;s distance. His skill with hypnosis requires only a glance into the eyes to put the subject under a trance. The Doctor can read an entire book cover to cover in a second by thumb-flipping the pages before his eyes (&quot;City of Death&quot;, &quot;Rose&quot;, &quot;The Time of Angels&quot;). Though medical skills he shows early in the programme are rudimentary, by &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; he can perform sophisticated medical diagnoses merely by touching someone&#x27;s ear. He is an excellent cricket player (&quot;Black Orchid&quot;) and in &quot;The Lodger&quot; he proves to be a prodigiously talented footballer despite unfamiliarity with some of the game&#x27;s basic rules. Though reluctant to engage in combat against living opponents, this is not for lack of skill; the Doctor is conversant with both real and fictitious styles of unarmed combat (most obviously the &quot;Venusian Aikido&quot; practised by the Third, Twelfth and Thirteenth Doctors), has won several sword fights against skilled opponents, and is able to make extremely difficult shots with firearms and, in &quot;The Face of Evil&quot;, with a crossbow. Thanks to exposure to many of history&#x27;s greatest experts, including those from the future, the Doctor is a talented boxer, musician, organist, scientist and singer (able to shatter windows with his voice), and has a PhD in cheesemaking (&quot;The God Complex&quot;).

==Name==
In the first episode, the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter Susan goes by the surname &quot;Foreman&quot;, and the junkyard in which Barbara and Ian find him bears the sign &quot;I.M. Foreman&quot;. When addressed by Ian with this name, the Doctor responds, &quot;Eh? Doctor who? What&#x27;s he talking about?&quot; Ian realises that &quot;Foreman&quot; is not the Doctor&#x27;s name, when Barbara addresses the Doctor as &quot;Doctor Foreman&quot;; Ian asks Barbara, &quot;That&#x27;s not his name. Who is he? Doctor who?&quot; In an ultimately unused idea from documents written at the programme&#x27;s inception, Barbara and Ian would have subsequently referred to the Doctor as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, given their not knowing his name.

Throughout both the classic and revived programme, a running joke is that when the Doctor is introduced as just the Doctor, characters reply &quot;Doctor who?&quot; Another variation is &quot;Doctor what?&quot;

The story arc running throughout the tenure of the Eleventh Doctor involved the oldest question in the universe, revealed in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot; to be &quot;Doctor who?&quot;, giving the phrase in-universe significance. In &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s real name was revealed to be the password used to enter the Doctor&#x27;s tomb following his death on the planet Trenzalore. The story arc was resolved in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, wherein it was revealed that the question had been projected by the Time Lords across all of time and space through a &quot;crack in the skin of the universe&quot; as a means of contacting the Doctor and seeing whether it was safe to leave the parallel universe in which their planet, Gallifrey, had been left following the events of &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;. This arc was penned by Steven Moffat, who has been exploring the significance of the Doctor&#x27;s name in his episodes since 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;, in which historical figure Madame de Pompadour reads the Doctor&#x27;s mind and remarks, &quot;Doctor who? It&#x27;s more than just a secret, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; According to the in-vision commentary on the DVD release, David Tennant had to inform actress Sophia Myles (who played Madame de Pompadour) that she was not, in fact, revealing the Doctor&#x27;s surname as she believed was the intent of the dialogue. The 2011 mid-series finale &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;, also written by Moffat, suggested through the character of River Song that the Doctor&#x27;s travels had influenced the of the word &quot;doctor&quot;, perverting its meaning on some worlds from &quot;wise man&quot; or &quot;healer&quot; to &quot;great warrior&quot;. In &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009–2010) it is mentioned that after he smote a demon in the 13th century, the residents of a convent called the Doctor the &quot;sainted physician&quot;.

This was proposed by Moffat on Usenet 16 years before &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;:

The anonymity of the Doctor is the theme of series 7 of the revived programme. After faking his death, the Doctor erases himself from the various databases of the universe. In &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot;, a &quot;time splinter&quot; of future companion Clara Oswald using the name Oswin wipes all knowledge of the Doctor from the Daleks&#x27; collective memory. This knowledge is regained when the Daleks conquer the Church of the Silence in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; (2013). The Doctor is not present on Solomon&#x27;s database in &quot;Dinosaurs on a Spaceship&quot; and holds a conversation about his newfound anonymity in &quot;The Angels Take Manhattan&quot; with River Song. In &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;, the collective consciousness of the Cybermen informs the Doctor that he could be reconstructed from the &quot;hole&quot; — the missing records — that he has left behind, a mistake which the Doctor intends to rectify.

Few individuals are said to know the Doctor&#x27;s true name. River Song whispered something to the Tenth Doctor to make him trust her during &quot;Silence in the Library&quot;/&quot;Forest of the Dead&quot;, confirmed to have been his name towards the end of &quot;Forest of the Dead&quot;. The events of &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; make it clear that his people, the Time Lords, know his true name, despite calling him by his chosen alias as &quot;the Doctor&quot; even in formal settings such as court.

Despite the common belief amongst some areas of the fanbase that the Doctor should never be referred to by the name of the series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is actually fairly often used as the character&#x27;s name, most frequently in the spin-off material of the 1960s and 1970s, but occasionally also in the TV series itself. For example, in &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; the Doctor assumes the name of Doctor Caligari and subsequently responds to the question &quot;Doctor who?&quot; with &quot;yes, quite right.&quot; In the serial &quot;The War Machines&quot;, the computer WOTAN commands that &quot;Doctor Who is required&quot;, and his human agents also use the name. The Third Doctor&#x27;s car, dubbed &quot;Bessie&quot;, carried the plate WHO 1, the only ongoing reference to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; enigma in the original programme. The Third Doctor later drove an outlandish vehicle called the &quot;Whomobile&quot; in publicity materials, but it is never referred to as such in the programme, being simply known as &quot;the Doctor&#x27;s car&quot; (or &quot;my car&quot;, as the Doctor puts it). The name &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is used in the title of the serial &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;, but this was a captioning error rather than an in-story mention. The only other time this occurs is in the title of episode five of &quot;The Chase&quot;, which is titled &quot;The Death of Doctor Who&quot;. In &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; (2017), the Doctor&#x27;s old friend and archenemy the Master (as Missy) insists that the Doctor&#x27;s real name is in fact Doctor Who and that he chose it himself; the Doctor tries to reassure his companion that Missy is joking, although later in the episode he self-identifies by that name.

In &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, before regeneration, the Twelfth Doctor states that no one would ever understand his name except for children, saying: &quot;If their hearts are in the right place and the stars are too, children can hear your name.&quot; Peter Capaldi offered his own theory regarding the Doctor&#x27;s real name, commenting: &quot;I don&#x27;t think human beings could even really say his name. But I think we might be able to hear it, at a certain frequency. If the stars are in the right place, and your heart&#x27;s in the right place, you&#x27;ll hear it.&quot;

On occasion, the Doctor uses other aliases, such as &quot;John Smith&quot;. In the Fourth Doctor serial &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot;, the Doctor runs into a former classmate of his named Drax. Drax calls the Doctor &quot;Theta Sigma&quot;, or &quot;Thete&quot; for short, an alias which is clarified as being the Doctor&#x27;s nickname at the Prydon Academy on Gallifrey in &quot;The Happiness Patrol&quot; and is mentioned again in the 2010 episode &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;. In the 2015 episode &quot;The Zygon Inversion&quot;, The Doctor tells Osgood that his first name is &quot;Basil&quot;.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off media have suggested that the character uses &quot;the Doctor&quot; because his actual name is impossible for humans to pronounce. For instance, the novel &quot;Vanderdeken&#x27;s Children&quot; relates that the Doctor has already told Sam his real name, which is entirely alien and virtually unpronounceable. This is repeated by companion Peri Brown in the radio serial &quot;Slipback&quot;. The Faction Paradox encyclopaedia &quot;The Book of the War&quot; states that all renegades from the Homeworld/Gallifrey abandon their names to symbolise how they are leaving their culture. Similarly, the novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; reveals that the Doctor&#x27;s name has been struck from the records of his family and therefore cannot be spoken.

===Alias &quot;The Doctor&quot;===
Quite apart from his name, why the Doctor uses the title &quot;The Doctor&quot; has never been fully explained on screen. The Doctor, at first, said that he was not a physician, often describing himself as a scientist or an engineer. However, he does occasionally show medical knowledge and has stated on separate occasions that he studied under Joseph Lister and Joseph Bell. In &quot;The Moonbase&quot; (1967), the Second Doctor mentions that he studied for a medical degree in Glasgow during the 19th century. The Fourth Doctor was awarded an honorary degree from St. Cedd&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1960. He has been mocked by his fellow Time Lords for adhering to such a &quot;lowly&quot; title as &quot;Doctor&quot;, although, in &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot; (1979), Drax congratulates him on achieving his doctorate, indicating it was at least a somewhat respectable title. In &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot; (2006), he draws an analogy between the title and Madame de Pompadour&#x27;s.

In &quot;The Mutants&quot; (1972), an official asks the Third Doctor if he is, in fact, a doctor, to which the Doctor replies &quot;I am, yes&quot;; when asked what he is qualified in, the Doctor replies, &quot;Practically everything.&quot; The Fourth Doctor states that his companion, Harry Sullivan, is a doctor of medicine, while he is &quot;a doctor of many things&quot; (&quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;, 1975). The Fifth Doctor claims to be a doctor &quot;of everything&quot; in &quot;Four to Doomsday&quot; (1982), and a message to the same effect is related from the Tenth Doctor in &quot;Utopia&quot; (2007). In &quot;The Tsuranga Conundrum&quot; (2018), the Thirteenth Doctor states that she is a doctor of &quot;medicine, science, engineering, candyfloss, Lego, philosophy, music, problems, people, hope. Mostly hope.&quot; While talking with Harry in &quot;Robot&quot; (1974–1975), the Doctor says, &quot;You may be &quot;a&quot; doctor, but I&#x27;m &quot;the&quot; Doctor. The definite article, you might say.&quot; In &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; (1975), aired later that year, the Doctor mentions that his doctorate is only honorary; the Tenth Doctor, however, considers the name to be his legitimate academic rank in &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot; (2009), describing his &quot;name, rank and intention&quot; as &quot;The Doctor; doctor; fun.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Age&quot; in 2003, Tom Baker mentioned that the Doctor is called so because he is &quot;a doctor of time and relative dimension in space&quot;. Apart from being called a doctor of the TARDIS, he has been described as a &quot;doctor of time travel&quot;.

The revived programme establishes that Time Lords invent their own names. In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; (2007), the Tenth Doctor remarks to the Master that they both chose their names, with the Master calling him sanctimonious for identifying himself as &quot;the man who makes people better&quot;. The Eleventh Doctor, in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, elaborates that the name is a promise to be: &quot;Never cruel or cowardly. Never giving up and never giving in.&quot; This statement is repeated in the next episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, by the War Doctor, the Tenth Doctor and the Eleventh Doctor collectively. By contrast, the Eleventh Doctor had earlier spoke of the War Doctor as being the man who broke that promise, being the one to fight in the Time War before learning the actual fate of the Time Lords. Since contradicted by the television series, the 2003 Telos novella &quot;Frayed&quot; by Tara Samms, set prior to the programme&#x27;s first episode in 1963, presents the alternative explanation that the Doctor was given that name by medical staff on a foreign planet and liked it.

To make up for his lack of a practical name, the Doctor often relies upon convenient pseudonyms. In &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; (1966), the First Doctor uses the alias Dr. Caligari. In &quot;The Highlanders&quot; (1966–67), the Second Doctor assumes the name of &quot;Doctor von Wer&quot; (a German approximation of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), and signs himself as &quot;Dr. W&quot; in &quot;The Underwater Menace.&quot; He similarly poses as &quot;the Great Wizard Quiquaequod&quot; in &quot;The Dæmons&quot; (&quot;qui&quot;, &quot;quae&quot; and &quot;quod&quot; being, respectively, the masculine, feminine and neuter Latin translation of the nominative form of &quot;who&quot;). The Master also utilised Latin translation in the same serial, posing as &quot;Mr Magister&quot;. The Eighth Doctor&#x27;s companion Grace briefly refers to him by the alias &quot;Dr. Bowman&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie.

In &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; (1968), his companion Jamie McCrimmon, reading the name on medical equipment, tells the crew of the Wheel that the Doctor&#x27;s name is &quot;John Smith&quot;. The Doctor subsequently adopts this alias numerous times over the course of the programme, sometimes prefixing the title &quot;Doctor&quot; to it.

In the audio adventure, &quot;The Sirens of Time&quot; (1999), when the Fifth Doctor is asked his name, this conversation ensues:

&quot;I&#x27;m the Doctor.&quot;
&quot;Doctor? That&#x27;s a profession, not a name.&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s all I have.&quot;
To his greatest enemies, the Daleks, the Doctor is known as the &quot;Ka Faraq Gatri,&quot; the &quot;Enemy of the Daleks&quot;, the &quot;Bringer of Darkness&quot;, or &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;. This is first mentioned in the 1990 novelisation of &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; by Ben Aaronovitch and subsequently taken up in the spin-off media, particularly the Virgin New Adventures books and the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip. Davros uses the title &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot; to describe the Doctor in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008). In the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Love and War&quot;, the Doctor is referred to as &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot; by the Draconians (whose word for it is &quot;Karshtakavaar&quot;); according to the episode &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005), the same title is used by the Daleks. The Doctor refers to himself as &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot; in &quot;The Lodger&quot; (2010). In &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; (2012), it is stated that Daleks refer to the Doctor as &quot;The Predator&quot;. The Virgin New Adventure &quot;Zamper&quot; (1995) establishes that the Chelonians refer to him as &quot;Interfering Idiot.&quot;

The programme has occasionally toyed with the Doctor&#x27;s identity (or lack thereof). In the first part of &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot; (1986), the Doctor suggests writing a thesis on &quot;Ancient Life on Ravolox, by Doctor...&quot;, but is interrupted by his companion Peri. In &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot;, the Time Lord Drax addresses the Fourth Doctor as &quot;Thete&quot;, short for &quot;Theta Sigma&quot;. Later, in &quot;The Happiness Patrol&quot; (1988), this was clarified as a nickname from the Doctor&#x27;s university days; he is called by this name again in the Paul Cornell novel &quot;Goth Opera.&quot; In &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, the Seventh Doctor produces a calling card with a series of pseudo-Greek letters inscribed on it (as well as a stylised question mark). This may be a reference to &quot;The Making of Doctor Who&quot; (1972), by Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, which claims that the Doctor&#x27;s true name is a string of Greek letters and mathematical symbols.

The question mark motif was common throughout the 1980s, in part as a branding attempt. Beginning with season eighteen, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors all sported costumes with a red question mark motif (usually on the shirt collars, except for the Seventh Doctor — it appeared on his pullover and in the shape of his umbrella handle). In the 1978 serial &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;, the Fourth Doctor is asked to sign a document; although the signature itself is not directly seen on screen, his hand movements clearly indicate that he signs it with a question mark. A similar scene occurs with the Seventh Doctor in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks.&quot;

===On-screen credits===
In the early years of the franchise, the character was credited as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; or &quot;Dr Who&quot;, up to the final story of season 18, &quot;Logopolis&quot; (1981), which was the last story featuring Tom Baker as the then-incumbent Fourth Doctor. Beginning with the debut of Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor in &quot;Castrovalva&quot; (1982), the character was credited as &quot;The Doctor&quot;, which he had always been called in-universe since the tenure of William Hartnell. This credit remained from season 19 to season 26. In the television movie, the trend was continued, with Paul McGann&#x27;s debuting Eighth Doctor credited as &quot;The Doctor&quot; and Sylvester McCoy&#x27;s out-going Seventh Doctor as &quot;The Old Doctor&quot;. The 2005 resurrection of the programme credited Christopher Eccleston — playing the Ninth Doctor — as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; again in series 1. &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, featuring the Ninth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration into the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant), credits Tennant as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The credit reverted to &quot;The Doctor&quot; for 2005&#x27;s Christmas special &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; and all subsequent stories at Tennant&#x27;s request. Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker have continued to be credited as &quot;The Doctor&quot;.

John Hurt plays a mysterious past incarnation of the Doctor in the 50th anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, with minor roles in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; and mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;, created as a &quot;mayfly Doctor&quot; by Steven Moffat. In the television episodes, he is credited as &quot;The Doctor&quot;, but he is introduced as &quot;The War Doctor&quot; in &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;. The end of &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; closes with text superimposed over footage of Hurt introducing him, pictured to the left, which was unprecedented for the show. In &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, Hurt appears in a &quot;multi-Doctor&quot; special alongside Matt Smith and David Tennant as the Eleventh and Tenth Doctors, respectively. The three are collectively credited as &quot;The Doctor&quot; alongside Christopher Eccleston, Paul McGann, Sylvester McCoy, Colin Baker, Peter Davison, Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee, Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell (although the latter nine appeared only through the reuse of archive footage). Tom Baker also appears in an uncredited part as &quot;the Curator&quot;, an ambiguously different character who resembles the Fourth Doctor. A voice actor, John Guilor, recorded a line of audio impersonating the First Doctor, for which he was credited as &quot;Voice Over Artist&quot;.

In other multi-Doctor stories, the multiple actors are all credited as &quot;The Doctor&quot;, the exception being &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; (1972–1973), which credited William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the 1972 serial preceded the practice of crediting the character as &quot;The Doctor&quot;. In &quot;Human Nature&quot; (2007), the plot involves the Tenth Doctor altering his biology and becoming a human to avoid detection. As a human, he takes the name &quot;John Smith&quot;. David Tennant is credited as &quot;The Doctor/Smith&quot; for the episode, although the two-parter&#x27;s concluding episode, &quot;The Family of Blood&quot; (2007), credits him simply as &quot;The Doctor&quot;.

==Changing faces==
The recasting of actors playing the part of the Doctor is explained within the programme by the Time Lords&#x27; ability to regenerate after suffering illness, mortal injury or old age. The process repairs all damage and rejuvenates the Doctor&#x27;s body, but as a side effect it changes the Doctor&#x27;s physical appearance and personality. This ability was not introduced until producers had to find a way to replace the ailing William Hartnell with Patrick Troughton and was not explicitly called &quot;regeneration&quot; until the third such instance, at the climax of &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; (1974). On screen, the transformation from Hartnell to Troughton was called a &quot;renewal&quot; and from Troughton to Pertwee a &quot;change of appearance&quot;.

The original concept of regeneration or renewal was that the Doctor&#x27;s body would rebuild itself in a younger, healthier form. The Second Doctor was intended to be a literally younger version of the First; biological time would turn back, and several hundred years would get taken off the Doctor&#x27;s age, rejuvenating him. In practice, however, since the Doctor stated his age in the Second Doctor serial &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; (1967), his age has been recorded progressively (see below). On most occasions, regeneration has seen a younger actor assume the role of the Doctor; the only exceptions to this are the introductions of the Third, Sixth, Twelfth and Fourteenth Doctors, although Steven Moffat initially intended to cast an actor in his mid-30s to 40s for the role of the Eleventh Doctor.

The 60th anniversary special episode &quot;The Giggle&quot; introduced a new twist on the regeneration concept called bi-generation, whereby a new Time Lord incarnation can be created by a new body emerging from and splitting off from the body of a previous incarnation. In the episode, the Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant) underwent a bi-generation after being shot with UNIT&#x27;s galvanic beam by the Toymaker (Neil Patrick Harris), leading to the Fifteenth Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) to effectively be birthed, while also allowing the previous incarnation to retain his physical form and exist independently.

=== Actors ===
The actors who have played the lead role of the Doctor to date in the programme, and the dates of their first and last regular television appearances in the role, are:


In addition to the above-listed actors, others have played versions of the Doctor for the duration of particular storylines. Notably, John Hurt guest starred as the War Doctor in the closing moments of the 2013 episode &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, the webcast &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; and the 50th Anniversary episode &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;. The War Doctor exists between those of McGann and Eccleston. Hurt was never the programme&#x27;s lead actor; his Doctor was retroactively inserted into continuity for the programme&#x27;s 50th anniversary, and was written so as not to disturb the ordinal naming of the established Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. In the 1986 serial &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;, Michael Jayston played the Valeyard, an amalgamation of the Doctor&#x27;s darker sides from between his twelfth and final incarnations. In the Series 12 episode &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot;, Jo Martin played a previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor, later confirmed to precede the First Doctor. The capacity for the Doctor to have other previously unknown regenerations prior to the First Doctor was introduced in &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; (2020), having previously been hinted at in the serial &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot;.

===Personality===
While the Doctor remains essentially the same person throughout their regenerations, each actor has purposely imbued the character with distinct quirks and characteristics, and the production teams dictate new personality traits for each actor to portray.

Several personality traits remain constant throughout the Doctor&#x27;s incarnations, most notably a disarming or mercurial surface, concealing a deep well of age, wisdom, melancholy, and darkness. This duality is explored more overtly in the revived series (2005–present), which has described him as &quot;fire and ice and rage, he&#x27;s like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun, he&#x27;s ancient and forever, he burns at the centre of time...&quot; and &quot;the man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name&quot;. Though the Doctor tends to present a jocular, even childlike, persona, when the stakes rise—e.g., in &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; (1975)—that mask tends to fall, revealing a Doctor who is cold, driven, at times callous.

This dark side sits in contrast to the Doctor&#x27;s deep compassion, which manifests to different strength and effect across their incarnations. The Doctor prefers a pacifist solution to most problems, and is an ardent champion of life and dignity over violence and war. Their pacifism runs deeply enough to, on many occasions, doubt the morality of destroying their worst enemies - the Daleks. Their compassion for their fallen friend, the Master, often runs against clear reason or self-interest, as when they urge a dying Master to regenerate (&quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;) or vows to watch over them for 1,000 years in order to avert their execution (&quot;Extremis&quot;).

The Doctor has a deep sense of right and wrong, and a conviction that it is right to intervene when injustice occurs, which sets them apart from their own people, the Time Lords, and their strict ethic of non-intervention.

Often the Doctor is critical of others who employ deadly force, be they their companions (Leela in &quot;The Face of Evil&quot; and &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; (1977); Jack Harkness in &quot;Utopia&quot; (2007)) or other supporting characters. In the episode &quot;The Lodger&quot; (2010), a member of the Doctor&#x27;s football team offhandedly mentions annihilating the team they will play next week. The Doctor looks very angry and says, &quot;No violence, not while I&#x27;m around, not today, not ever. I&#x27;m the Doctor, the oncoming storm... and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;

The Doctor has a particular dislike for ranged weapons such as firearms or rayguns and tends to make a special effort to avoid their use. The Tenth Doctor especially makes a show of his distaste, discarding guns while declaring &quot;I never would!&quot; (&quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;) and asserting that he is unarmed: &quot;That&#x27;s me. Always.&quot; (&quot;Doomsday&quot;). On some rare occasions, the Doctor does make use of weapons (as in Day of the Daleks, The Talons of Weng Chiang, and Resurrection of the Daleks), but most of the time it is usually to bluff or employ for an alternative use, e.g., destroying a machine vital to their enemies&#x27; scheme (&quot;The End of Time&quot;).

Nonetheless, when brought to an extreme (e.g., &quot;Earthshock,&quot; &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot;, &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;) the Doctor may resort to violence—even deadly force—to protect those considered under the Doctor&#x27;s care. In &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1988), the Doctor even contrives for the Daleks&#x27; homeworld, Skaro, to be destroyed, albeit manipulating the Daleks into doing it themselves after he sabotaged their equipment. Starting with the 2005 revival, the Doctor carries the weight of a Time War between the Daleks and his people, the Time Lords, in which he believes himself responsible for the genocide of both races, in aid of the greater good, but this burden was lessened after &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; revealed that the Doctor&#x27;s thirteen incarnations joined forces to save Gallifrey and create the illusion of its destruction.

Bearing the strain of his wartime actions, the Ninth Doctor deliberately tortures a lone Dalek he encounters (&quot;Dalek&quot;), despite its pleas to &quot;have pity&quot;, stating coldly, &quot;You never did&quot;. The Tenth Doctor notably declares a &quot;one chance only&quot; policy when dealing with aliens invading the Earth, leading his companion Donna Noble to comment that he needs &quot;someone&quot; to keep his temperament in check. In &quot;The Family of Blood&quot; (2007), a defeated alien reflects that the Doctor &quot;never raised his voice – that was the worst thing, the fury of a Time Lord&quot;. Through the course of his adventures, the Eleventh Doctor underwent significant personality shifts, becoming ever more ruthless when travelling alone; falling into a deep depression and inertia when his friends Amy and Rory were lost to him, and finally undergoing a manic change at the prospect that Clara &quot;Oswin&quot; Oswald was still alive. By contrast, the Twelfth Doctor became a lighter person over the course of his life, beginning with a grim mood where he may have dropped a man out of a hot air balloon and questioning his own nature (&quot;Into the Dalek&quot;) but ending with a firm resolve that he would take the hard option just because it was right (&quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;).

===Accent===
Different actors have used different regional accents in the role. The first six Doctors spoke in Received Pronunciation or &quot;BBC English&quot;, as was standard on British television at the time. Sylvester McCoy used a very mild version of his own Scottish accent in the role, and Paul McGann spoke with a faint Liverpudlian lilt. Only rarely is this even addressed in the programme. In the case of McGann&#x27;s Doctor, who is identified by American characters as &quot;British&quot;, he seems only slightly conscious of the way he sounds, responding with &quot;Yes, I suppose I am.&quot; When the accent of Eccleston&#x27;s Doctor is clearly described as &quot;Northern&quot;, he responds with the line &quot;Lots of planets have a North.&quot; Capaldi&#x27;s portrayal of the Doctor explicitly identified his own accent as &quot;Scottish&quot; after commenting on the English accents of his friends, Jenny Flint and Clara Oswald, while experiencing post-regeneration amnesia (&quot;Deep Breath&quot;). Whittaker&#x27;s Thirteenth Doctor speaks with the actress&#x27; natural Yorkshire accent and is identified as British during a trip to America. The Fifteenth Doctor also speaks with the actor&#x27;s natural Scottish-Rwandan accent.

Another example is in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; when the Doctor is identified as &quot;English&quot; and, dissembling, plays along. Though David Tennant speaks with a natural Scottish accent, he played the Tenth Doctor with an Estuary English accent (apart from when, in the Highlands-set episode &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;, the character is pretending to be a local). According to producer Russell T Davies, this was intended as a consequence of spending so much time with Rose. &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; would have alluded to this, but the line was cut. Davies also said that after Eccleston&#x27;s accent, he did not want Tennant &quot;touring the regions&quot; with a Scottish one, and so asked Tennant to affect the same accent he used for the earlier BBC period drama &quot;Casanova&quot;. In contrast, Peter Capaldi was explicitly allowed to continue using his native Scottish accent as the Twelfth Doctor.

In the Big Finish audio adventure &quot;The Sirens of Time&quot;, the captain aboard a German U-boat assumes that he is English because of the way he pronounces his words: &quot;So, you speak German ... but you speak it like an English gentleman.&quot;

===Clothing===
The Doctor&#x27;s clothing has been equally distinctive, from the distinguished Edwardian suits of the First Doctor to the Second Doctor&#x27;s rumpled, clown-like Chaplinesque attire to the dandyish frills and velvet of the Third Doctor&#x27;s era. The Fourth Doctor&#x27;s long frock coat, loose-fitting trousers, occasionally worn a wide-brimmed hat and trailing, multi-striped scarf added to his somewhat shambolic and bohemian image; the Fifth&#x27;s Edwardian cricketer&#x27;s outfit suited his youthful, aristocratic air as well as his love of the sport (with a stick of celery on the lapel for an eccentric touch, though in &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (1984), it is revealed to turn purple when exposed to gases the Doctor is allergic to); and the Sixth&#x27;s multicoloured jacket, with its cat-shaped lapel pins, reflected the excesses of 1980s fashion. The Seventh Doctor&#x27;s outfit – a Panama hat, a coat with a scarf, a tie, checked trousers and brogues/wing-tips – was more subdued and suggestive of a showman, reflecting his whimsical approach to life. In later seasons, as his personality grew more mysterious, his jacket, tie and hatband all grew darker.

Throughout the 1980s, question marks formed a constant motif, usually on the shirt collars or, in the case of the Seventh Doctor, on his sleeveless jumper and the handle to his umbrella. The idea was grounded in branding considerations, as was the movement starting in Tom Baker&#x27;s final season toward an unchanging costume for each Doctor, rather than the variants on a theme employed over the first seventeen years of the programme. When the Eighth Doctor regenerated, he clad himself in a 19th-century frock coat and shirt based on a Wild Bill Hickok costume, reminiscent of the out-of-time quality of earlier Doctors and emphasising the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s more Romantic persona.

In contrast to the more flamboyant outfits of his predecessors, the Ninth Doctor wore a nondescript, weathered black leather jacket, V-neck jumper and dark trousers. Eccleston stated that he felt that such definitive &quot;costumes&quot; were passé and that the character&#x27;s trademark eccentricities should show through his actions and clever dialogue, not through gimmicky costumes. Despite this, there is a running joke about his character that the only piece of clothing he changes is his jumper, even when trying to &quot;blend into&quot; a historical era. The one exception, a photograph of him taken in 1912, wearing period gentleman&#x27;s clothing, resembles the style of the Eighth Doctor.

The Tenth Doctor sports either a brown or a blue pinstripe suit – usually worn with ties – a tan ankle-length coat and trainers, the latter recalling the plimsolls worn by his fifth incarnation. Also like that incarnation (and his first one), he occasionally wears spectacles. In the 2007 &quot;Children in Need&quot; &quot;Time Crash&quot; special he states that he does not actually need glasses to see, but rather wears them to &quot;look a bit clever&quot;, as did the Fifth, whom he meets in the special. On occasions, he wears a black tuxedo with matching black trainers. In interviews, Tennant has described his Doctor&#x27;s attire as geek chic. According to Tennant, he had always wanted to wear the trainers. The overall costume was influenced by an outfit worn by Jamie Oliver in a TV interview on the talk show &quot;Parkinson&quot;.

The Tenth Doctor says in &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; that, like the TARDIS, his pockets are bigger on the inside. The Second, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors routinely carried numerous items in their coats without this being conspicuous.

The Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s appearance has been described as appearing like &quot;an Oxford professor&quot;, with a tweed jacket, red or blue striped shirt, red or blue bow tie, black or grey trousers with red or blue braces, and black boots. He maintains &quot;Bow ties are cool&quot; even when his companions do not agree, and is delighted to meet Dr Black, the first man who agrees with him, in the episode &quot;Vincent and the Doctor&quot; (2010). As a running gag, he exhibits attraction to unusual hats, like a fez, a pirate hat and a stetson, often only to have them destroyed by River Song shortly afterwards. Starting in the second half of series 7, the Eleventh Doctor reverted to wearing a frock coat, similar to those worn by his predecessors, with a waistcoat and black trousers, black braces, an off-white shirt, bow tie and brown boots. He also added round-rimmed glasses that belonged to former companion Amy Pond.

The Twelfth Doctor&#x27;s costume has been described as looking like a magician. It echoes his third incarnation&#x27;s look, specifically the red lining on the inside of his Crombie coat. It has been described as &quot;no frills, no scarves, just 100% rebel Time Lord&quot;. The Twelfth Doctor wears a white shirt with no tie, with his top button fastened and no cuff links, a dark blue cardigan (sometimes replaced with a waistcoat), navy trousers and black boots.

The Thirteenth Doctor&#x27;s costume features blue high-waisted culottes with yellow braces, a navy blue or burgundy shirt with a rainbow stripe across it, a lilac-blue coat, brown lace-up boots, blue socks and piercings on her left ear. During the clip where Whittaker was announced as the new Doctor, she wore a grey overcoat over a black hoodie, reminiscent of Capaldi&#x27;s costume.

The Doctor has occasionally expressed distaste and confusion about his own fashion choices in other incarnations. The First Doctor described his third incarnation as a &quot;Dandy&quot;, and his second incarnation as a clown. The Tenth Doctor cringed at his fifth self&#x27;s choice of wearing celery on his lapel. The Eleventh Doctor, upon meeting his previous self, referred to his Converse trainers as &quot;sand-shoes&quot;. The Twelfth Doctor believes his previous incarnation&#x27;s long scarf &quot;looked stupid&quot; and his prior&#x27;s love of bow-ties is &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

===Transitions===

Each regeneration to date has been worked into the continuing story, and most regenerations (minus the Second-to-Third) have been portrayed on-screen, in a handing over of the role. Before permanently dying, a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times for a total of thirteen incarnations. The following list details the manner of each transition between incarnations:
*First Doctor (William Hartnell): Succumbed to old age after being weakened by the Cybermen&#x27;s draining of Earth&#x27;s energy before being &quot;renewed&quot; by the TARDIS in &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; (1966). He briefly stalled the process before embracing regeneration as seen in &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; (2017).
*Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton): A forced &quot;change in appearance&quot; (and exile to Earth) by the Time Lords as punishment for breaching their law of non-intervention in &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969).
*Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee): Succumbed to radiation poisoning from the planet Metebelis III in &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; (1974).
*Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker): Mortally injured after falling from the Pharos Project telescope and merged with a mysterious &quot;in-between&quot; incarnation named &#x27;The Watcher&#x27; in &quot;Logopolis&quot; (1981).
*Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison): Succumbed to spectrox poisoning, contracted near the start of &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (1984).
*Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker): Mortally injured when the Rani attacked and crash-landed the TARDIS on the planet Lakertya at the start of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; (1987).
*Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy): Shot by a San Francisco street gang and killed during exploratory heart surgery by a doctor unfamiliar with Time Lord physiology surgery due to having unfamiliar anatomy; surgical anaesthetic stalled his regeneration in the 1996 television film.
*Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann): Killed after crash-landing a gunship on the planet Karn in &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; (2013). There, the Sisterhood of Karn revived the Doctor and provided an elixir that allowed him to choose the outcome of his next regeneration.
*War Doctor (John Hurt): Succumbed to old age shortly after &quot;wearing a bit thin&quot; in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013) due to having spent the duration of this incarnation&#x27;s lifetime fighting in the Time War.
*Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston): Absorbed Time Vortex energy from Rose Tyler, who had absorbed it from the TARDIS, resulting in cellular degeneration in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005).

*Tenth Doctor (David Tennant): Having aborted one regeneration to heal from Dalek gun in &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; (2008) by healing himself before directing the remaining regeneration energy into his severed hand in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008), he later succumbs to radiation poisoning incurred while saving Wilfred Mott, using up his twelfth regeneration in &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009–10).
*Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith): Aged after several hundred years defending the planet Trenzalore, and in his final body, the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; (2013).
*Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi): Electrocuted by a Mondasian Cyberman aboard a colony ship before being caught in an explosion in &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot; (2017). Initially refusing to change again, the Doctor finally embraces regeneration at the end of &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; (2017).
*Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker): Attacked by the Master with Qurunx energy in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; (2022).
* Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant): Attacked by The Toymaker with UNIT&#x27;s galvanic beam in &quot;The Giggle&quot; (2023). This incarnation still lives and exists independently of the Fifteenth Doctor following a &quot;bi-generation&quot;.

The Doctor&#x27;s first (Hartnell to Troughton), ninth (Hurt to Eccleston), and thirteenth (Smith to Capaldi) regenerations occur due to natural causes – in all three cases, the Doctor was dying from old age, and commented that his body is &quot;wearing a bit thin&quot;, though in the First Doctor&#x27;s case this is apparently exacerbated by the energy drain from Mondas. In the case of the rare &quot;bi-regeneration&quot;, the Fourteenth Doctor continued to exist independent of the Fifteenth Doctor. All of the other regenerations have been caused by external factors, such as radiation poisoning, infection or fatal injuries. So in basic terms, The First, War and Eleventh Doctors died from old age while the Fourteenth Doctor is still alive following a &quot;bi-generation&quot;. All other incarnations were killed.

In the original programme, with the exception of the change from Troughton to Pertwee, regeneration usually occurred when the previous Doctor was near &quot;death&quot;. The changeover from McCoy to McGann was handled differently, with the Doctor actually dying and being dead for a time before regeneration occurred. The Eighth Doctor comments at one point in the television movie that the anaesthesia interfered with the regenerative process and that he had been &quot;dead too long&quot;, accounting for his initial amnesia. Kate Orman&#x27;s novel &quot;The Room with No Doors&quot;, set just before the regeneration, notes that this is one of the few regenerations in which the Doctor was not conscious and aware that he was dying.

The Second Doctor (Troughton), was the only Doctor whose regeneration was due to nothing more than a need to change his appearance. He was not aged, in ill health nor mortally wounded at the end of &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969). Prior to his exile, the Time Lords deemed that his current appearance was too well known on Earth and therefore forced a &quot;change of appearance&quot; on him. This method of changing appearance was a source of early speculation that the Second and Third Doctor were actually the same incarnation since the second was never seen to truly &quot;die&quot; onscreen. Continuity has since established that one of his allotted regenerations was indeed used up for this transition.

The 2005 series began with the Ninth Doctor already regenerated and fully stabilised, with no explanation given. In his first appearance in &quot;Rose&quot; (2005), the Doctor looks in a mirror and comments on the size of his ears, suggesting that the regeneration may have happened shortly prior, or that he has not examined his reflection recently. Russell T Davies, writer/producer of the new series, stated in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; that he had no intention of showing the regeneration in the series, and that he believed the story of how the Eighth Doctor became the Ninth is best told in other media. In &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, Davies revealed his reasoning that, after such a long hiatus, a regeneration in the first episode would not just be confusing for new viewers but lack dramatic impact, as there would be no emotional investment in the character before he was replaced. The circumstances of the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration were explored during the 2013 specials, with the revelation of the incarnation played by Hurt that existed between the Doctor&#x27;s Eighth and Ninth incarnations.

In the 2013 mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;, a prelude to the 50th anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, it was revealed that the Eighth Doctor had been revived by the Sisterhood of Karn after dying in a spacecraft crash. The Sisterhood offered him an elixir that enabled him to choose the characteristics of his next regeneration, and he opted for &quot;a warrior&quot;; the final scene of the mini-episode shows him regenerating not into the Ninth Doctor, as was widely assumed, but into the War Doctor.

Davies&#x27;s 2018 novelisation of his debut episode &quot;Rose&quot; states that the Doctor&#x27;s future incarnations include &quot;a tall, bald black woman wielding a flaming sword&quot; and &quot;a young girl or boy in a hi-tech wheelchair with what looked like a robot dog at their side&quot;.

===Regenerations===

It was established in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976) that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times before permanently dying – a total of thirteen incarnations. The series depicted exceptions to the rule, such as &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; showing that the Time Lords can circumvent the cap of 12 regenerations in total by giving a Time Lord extra regenerations. While many of the previous regeneration sequences were unique, the Doctor&#x27;s regenerations of the revived programme were similar with each transition being an explosion of energy in a particularly violent fashion. This is seen from the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration damaging the TARDIS, to the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s causing a shock wave that devastated the countryside while obliterating a Dalek mother-ship.

In &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; (2005), it was stated the regenerative cycle creates a large amount of residual regeneration energy that suffuses the Time Lord&#x27;s body. As demonstrated by the Tenth Doctor for the first time in that story, in the first fifteen hours of regeneration this energy is enough to even rapidly regrow a severed hand.

In the case of the Doctor, his regenerations are usually a result of a previous incarnation sustaining mortal injury, though he can regenerate from old age and was once forced to regenerate by the Time Lords. A common side effect the Doctor frequently experiences is a period of instability and partial amnesia following regeneration. Some post-regeneration experiences have been more difficult than others. In particular, the Fifth Doctor began reverting to his previous personalities and required the healing powers of the TARDIS&#x27;s &quot;Zero Room&quot; to recuperate (&quot;Castrovalva&quot;). The Sixth Doctor experienced extreme paranoia and flew into a murderous rage, nearly killing his companion (&quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot;). The Eighth Doctor experienced amnesia due to the anaesthetics affecting his physiology (1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television film). While his regeneration first appeared to be smooth (&quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;), the Tenth Doctor began to experience spasms and became somewhat manic, frightening his companion as he pushed the TARDIS to dangerous extremes (Children in Need mini-episode). After crash-landing the TARDIS, the Doctor collapsed and remained unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours (&quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;). The experience was traumatic enough to cause one of his hearts to temporarily stop beating.

The TARDIS appears to aid in the regenerative process, with few occasions where the Doctor regenerates outside it. Three of these are initiated by Time Lords: one forced on him before banishment to Earth (&quot;The War Games&quot;), one requiring a Time Lord to give the Doctor&#x27;s cells a &quot;little push&quot; to start the process (&quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;), and one needing the Watcher – which the Doctor&#x27;s travelling companions believed to be some version of the Doctor himself (&quot;Logopolis&quot;). The Eighth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration apparently occurred a few hours after he had actually &quot;died&quot;, leaving him with temporary amnesia due to his body&#x27;s adverse reaction to earth medicines.

In the BBC Series 4 FAQ, writer Russell T Davies suggested that as the Time Lords were killed in the time war, the Doctor could be able to regenerate indefinitely. In &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, the Tenth Doctor manages to avert his own regeneration by using some of the energy to heal himself, then channeling the remaining energy into his severed hand, thus retaining his appearance and personality. That regenerative energy was a key point in a &quot;human–Time Lord biological metacrisis&quot; inadvertently caused by Donna Noble that creates the Meta-Crisis Doctor while she obtains a Time Lord intellect. In &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; the Eleventh Doctor revealed that it was considered a full regeneration; he just kept the same face due to &quot;vanity issues&quot;, and that he was now in his final life (given that the Tenth Doctor counted as two regenerations and the revelation of the existence of the War Doctor, this made a total of 12 regenerations). In the same episode, the Doctor is given a new cycle of regenerations by the Time Lords, allowing him to regenerate for the thirteenth time into the Twelfth Doctor, with the Twelfth Doctor (&quot;Kill the Moon&quot;) and Rassilon (&quot;Hell Bent&quot;) each expressing uncertainty about how many regenerations the Doctor now has.

====Multi-Doctor stories====

Due to time travel, it is possible for the Doctor&#x27;s various incarnations to encounter and interact with each other, although supposedly prohibited by the First Law of Time (as stated in &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;) or permitted only in the &quot;gravest of emergencies&quot; (&quot;The Five Doctors&quot;). In the 1963–1989 television programme, such encounters were seen on three occasions: in &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; (1972), &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; (1985). In &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot; (1972), the Third Doctor and Jo Grant very briefly met their future selves due to a glitch during a temporal experiment (the serial was supposed to end with the same scene depicted from the perspective of the &quot;other&quot; Doctor and Jo, but was excised because it was anticlimactic). In &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; (2005), the Ninth Doctor and Rose observed but did not interact with past versions of themselves; when Rose changed history, the earlier selves – after momentarily noticing Rose running past – vanished and a temporal paradox was created that attracted the extra-dimensional Reapers. The Tenth and Fifth Doctors met in the TARDIS in the mini-episode &quot;Time Crash&quot;, which aired on 16 November 2007 as part of the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal. This marks the first time the Doctor has met a previous incarnation since the programme&#x27;s revival. Although the scene aired outside the programme itself, it was established as taking place between the events of &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; and &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;.

In the Virgin New Adventures, the Seventh Doctor is shown briefly interacting with a man who may be the Third Doctor in the Sherlock Holmes crossover novel &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot;, but the scene is narrated from the perspective of Dr. Watson and thus the other man is never expressly identified. The Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; is a unique twist on the traditional multi-Doctor story as it focuses on the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s adventures before he meets the Seventh, where normal stories treat the later Doctor as &#x27;the&#x27; Doctor.

The BBC novel &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot; was written by respected Doctor Who writer Terrance Dicks, the same author who wrote &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. In it, he tries to reconcile the continuity errors of the 1996 movie, while having the Eighth Doctor meet and interact with each of his previous selves, although the Eighth Doctor visited each incarnation one at a time rather than all eight of them appearing in the same place. Later Eighth Doctor novel &quot;Interference – Book One&quot; sees the Eighth Doctor briefly meeting the Third, although this occasion results in the Doctor unwittingly changing his own history so that the Third Doctor will regenerate ahead of schedule (A change that is later &#x27;reset&#x27; in the novel &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot; thanks to the TARDIS taking action to preserve the original history). In the Past Doctor Adventures, the novel &quot;Heart of TARDIS&quot; features the Second and Fourth Doctors dealing with two different ends of the same crisis, with the Second Doctor trapped in a dimensional anomaly created by a government experiment and the Fourth recruited to stop the experiment destroying the world, but although they are at one point both in the Second Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS, the Fourth Doctor and his companion hide on the opposite side of the console from his past self and the Second is never aware of his future self. In &quot;The Colony of Lies&quot;, the Second Doctor briefly interacts with the Seventh Doctor in a VR simulation, but it is unspecified if this is the actual Seventh Doctor or just a VR program he left to advise his past self. In &quot;Wolfsbane&quot;, like in &quot;Heart of TARDIS&quot;, the Fourth and Eighth Doctors deal with separate ends of the same crisis, the Eighth stopping the threat in November 1936 while the Fourth ties up loose ends in December of the same year, but the two incarnations never meet directly, and due to the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s current amnesia none of the other characters realizes that the two Doctors are the same person.

Physical contact between two versions of the same person in the programme can lead to an energy discharge that shorts out the &quot;time differential&quot;. This is apparently due to a (fictional) principle known as the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, and was seen when the past and future versions of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart touched hands in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;. The Doctor&#x27;s incarnations do not appear to suffer this effect when encountering each other and shaking hands. This has never been explained. An essay in the &quot;About Time&quot; episode guides by Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood suggests that Time Lords are somehow exempt from the effect by their very nature. Rose Tyler is seen holding an infant version of herself in &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;, with no visible energy discharge, but the contact does allow the Reapers to enter the church in which the Doctor and several others are taking refuge. While doing a live commentary on the episode at the 2006 Bristol Comic Expo, episode author Paul Cornell said that this is supposed to be due to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, even though it is not mentioned by name. He suggested that the lack of a spark may be down to the fact that the Time Lords were no longer around to manage anomalies.

In the 2006 episode &quot;School Reunion&quot;, the Tenth Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith both seem to indicate in dialogue that they have not seen each other since her departure from the TARDIS in &quot;The Hand of Fear&quot;, although this contradicts their having met later during &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. In that story, she does not appear to realise that the Fifth Doctor is a later incarnation of the third and fourth Doctors with whom she had previously travelled. In &quot;Time Crash&quot;, the Tenth Doctor remembers and reproduces what he saw himself do when he was the Fifth Doctor, a fact that seems to surprise the Fifth Doctor himself.

Russell T Davies has expressed a dislike for stories in which multiple incarnations of the Doctor meet, stating that he believes they focus more on the actors than on the story itself. In 2007, David Tennant showed enthusiasm for the idea of a multi-Doctor story but expressed doubts about the practicality of episodes involving multiple previous Doctors, given that three of the actors who played the character were deceased.

Since the programme&#x27;s revival, there have been four multi-Doctor stories: the &quot;Children in Need&quot; special &quot;Time Crash&quot;, the 50th-anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the 2017 Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon A Time&quot;, and the series 12 episode &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot;. Before that, the only references to past incarnations (from 1963 to 1996) have been in the aforementioned episode &quot;School Reunion&quot; (in which the Doctor acknowledges having regenerated &quot;half a dozen times&quot; since last seeing Sarah Jane) and in drawings that the Doctor (who has temporarily become human to hide from the Family Of Blood) makes based on dreams of his other life in the 2007 episode &quot;Human Nature&quot;. Seen on screen are the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Doctors, but a fuller view briefly available on the BBC website depicted all ten incarnations. In the 2008 Christmas episode, &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, the Tenth Doctor discovers an info stamp originally held by the Cybermen, which includes images of all his past selves. This is a clear affirmation of his past, and that the (then) current incarnation was indeed the Tenth. This was reaffirmed in the episode &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, when the Doctor asks the Atraxi whether this planet is protected. The Atraxi then shows 10 images, one of each Doctor from the first to the tenth, with the eleventh walking through the image of the tenth at the end. This is confirmed in the episode &quot;The Lodger&quot;, when the Doctor, explaining to Craig who and what he is, points at his face and says, &quot;Eleventh&quot;.

Because each new Doctor is different from their previous incarnations, how their personalities interact varies when two or more different incarnations encounter each other. &quot;Time Crash&quot; featured Peter Davison returning as the Fifth Doctor. This event is explained as occurring due to the current Doctor having left his shields down when rebuilding the TARDIS following &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; and then accidentally crossing the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s timeline, allowing the two TARDISes to merge. When the Tenth Doctor effortlessly averts the impending Belgium-sized hole in the Universe caused by this temporal anomaly, he reveals having known what to do because he saw himself do it as the Fifth Doctor and remembered. He goes on to tell the Fifth Doctor how fond he was of his incarnation and how he influences the current Doctor&#x27;s personality. However, in their two meetings, the Second Doctor and Third Doctor had a degree of antagonism towards each other, with the patriarchal First Doctor critical of them both. During the Virgin New Adventures, the Seventh Doctor was occasionally at odds with his subconscious memory of his previous incarnation as his memory of his past self became increasingly associated with the Valeyard, his dark, future self, but he eventually accepted his dark side and &#x27;reformed&#x27; his memory of his former self, although it was never established how the two Doctors would interact if they had met in person.

On many occasions the Eleventh Doctor has actually encountered himself from a different point in his timeline – in &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, the mini-episodes &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Last Night&quot; – and in &quot;Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS&quot;, at the end, the Doctor interacted with his past self to reset time. In all stories, multiple versions of the Eleventh Doctor from different timelines meet and carry on brief conversations. Additionally, the Eleventh Doctor encountered an artificial (though physically and mentally identical) copy of himself in &quot;The Almost People&quot;; fought against &quot;Mister Clever&quot;, an artificial personality generated out of his own by the Cybermen in &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;; and was pitted against &quot;The Dream Lord&quot;, a manifestation of his self-loathing and anger, in &quot;Amy&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

Later, the Eleventh Doctor entered his own timeline in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; to rescue his companion Clara Oswald, and while there observed a past incarnation portrayed by John Hurt, one whose actions caused him to be unworthy of the name &quot;Doctor&quot; and viewed as shameful by his future selves. In the 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor encounters both the Tenth Doctor and the War Doctor (played by John Hurt). The Tenth and Eleventh Doctors are generally amicable towards each other, despite bickering, although the War Doctor treats them both as behaving too childishly. Despite this, he does come to admire both of his future incarnations, working together with them and eventually choosing to go through with the act of destroying Gallifrey because he knows it will help them become what they are. The Tenth and Eleventh are initially leery of the War Doctor, the Eleventh describing him as the &quot;one life I have tried very hard to forget&quot;. However, both of them later recognise that the War Doctor followed what seemed to be the only course open to him, and are even willing to help him carry it out so that he won&#x27;t have to suffer the guilt alone. Fortunately, with influence from the Moment – a sentient Time Lord weapon that brought about their meeting – the three are able to stumble upon an alternative: sending Gallifrey into a pocket universe, making it seem as though it has been destroyed. The three are then joined by the other nine previous Doctors and the future Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) in this act (the War, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors having evidently contacted them off-screen). The Eleventh Doctor is shown to have memories of these events but only recalls them after they have begun. This is explained in dialogue as an instability in the timeline, which causes the War and Tenth Doctors to forget their meeting, thus maintaining the continuity in which the Doctors from the War Doctor onwards believe themselves to have destroyed Gallifrey.

The Thirteenth Doctor meets a previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor portrayed by Jo Martin in &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot;. It is implied in &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; that Martin&#x27;s Doctor was a previous incarnation that had been erased from the Doctor&#x27;s memory by the Division.

====Reprising the role====


On a few occasions, previous actors to have played the Doctor have returned to the role, usually guest-starring with the incumbent:

*William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton with Jon Pertwee in &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;, the 10th anniversary special. Originally, Hartnell&#x27;s role had been intended to be more extensive, but his health had deteriorated to the extent that he could only make a limited appearance which would be his last television role.
*Troughton and Pertwee with Peter Davison in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, the 20th anniversary special, with newly released footage of Tom Baker and another actor, Richard Hurndall, standing in for the deceased Hartnell. Archive footage of Hartnell taken from &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; introduced the story. Baker declined to appear, feeling that the role came too soon after he had left the programme (a decision he later said he regretted) and the narrative was reworked to use clips from &quot;Shada&quot;, an intended six-part story from the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s era that was never completed due to industrial strikes. A waxwork dummy of Baker from Madame Tussauds was used in publicity photographs.
*Troughton with Colin Baker in &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;. This story is notable for not being produced either to celebrate the programme&#x27;s anniversary or as a &quot;Children in Need&quot; production.
*Pertwee, Tom Baker, Davison and Colin Baker with Sylvester McCoy in &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, the programme&#x27;s 30th anniversary charity special in aid of &quot;Children in Need&quot; in 1993. Hartnell and Troughton were represented by rubber heads, because both actors had died by then. Except for these mannequin versions of Hartnell and Troughton, no two Doctors are shown on screen at the same time. (This story was a crossover with &quot;EastEnders&quot;).
*McCoy returned to film early segments of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the TV film featuring the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s regeneration scene.
*Davison with David Tennant in the 2007 &quot;Children in Need&quot; mini-episode &quot;Time Crash&quot;.
*Paul McGann returned to film the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s final moments and regeneration in the 2013 mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;. None of the other Doctors appeared in this mini-episode, although archive footage of John Hurt appears briefly in the closing scene, for which he provided original audio.
*Tennant with Matt Smith in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the 50th anniversary special. Hurt made his first official appearance as a newly revealed incarnation of the Doctor. Tom Baker made a cameo appearance in the special as the curator of the National Gallery. He was implied to be a future Doctor who was &quot;revisiting&quot; an &quot;old favourite&quot; face, but the script never explicitly states this. Dialogue states that &quot;perhaps it doesn&#x27;t matter either way&quot; whether the Doctor and Curator are the same individual. Archive footage of Hartnell, Troughton, Pertwee, Tom Baker, Davison, Colin Baker, McCoy, McGann and Christopher Eccleston, with new audio from voice actor John Guilor impersonating Hartnell, was used to represent the other Doctors. Additionally, a brief appearance by Peter Capaldi, who was due to take over as the Doctor, was inserted, to represent all then-thirteen incarnations of the Doctor.
*Smith appeared in &quot;Deep Breath&quot;, the first full episode after his regeneration. He made a telephone call to his future to reassure Clara Oswald and urge her to accept his successor, portrayed by Capaldi. The scene was filmed on the set of &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, Smith&#x27;s last story as the incumbent Doctor, for the eighth series.
*Davison, Colin Baker, McCoy and McGann with Jodie Whittaker in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. They are seen as spirit forms. Davison and McCoy also appeared as holographic versions of their incarnations, when the Thirteenth Doctor talks to Tegan Jovanka and Ace. David Bradley reprised his role as the First Doctor from the episodes &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot; and &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; in this episode.
*Tennant appeared as the Fourteenth Doctor in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; and the 60th anniversary specials.

In addition to the above, Bradley, Tom Baker, Davison, Colin Baker, McCoy, McGann, Hurt, Eccleston and Tennant have reprised the role in audio dramas from Big Finish Productions.

==Age==

In early production documents, the Doctor was said to be 650 years old, although this was never stated on screen. By the time the Doctor did cite his age (&quot;Let me see, in human terms, 400, yes, 450 years&quot; in the serial &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; (1967); he kept a 500-year diary), he had already regenerated to a younger form. The intention at that time was that regeneration had turned back the Doctor&#x27;s clock, making him younger both in appearance and in biological age. Since the Doctor&#x27;s age had never previously been given, 450 Earth years became a starting point onto which further years would be progressively added as the series continued and the character lived out his further incarnations.

The Third Doctor implied in &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; (1970) and in &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot; (1971) that he had a lifetime that covered &quot;several thousand years&quot;. While the Doctor&#x27;s age has never been a known quantity, these numbers are the most difficult to reconcile with the rest of the series.

By the time of &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot;, the Fourth Doctor was stated to be 749 years old (&quot;something like 750 years&quot; in the prior &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;, which prompts Sarah Jane Smith to joke that he will &quot;soon be middle-aged&quot;). In &quot;The Ribos Operation&quot; (1978), Romana said the Doctor was 759 years old and had been piloting the TARDIS for 523 years, making him 236 when he first &quot;borrowed&quot; it. When the Doctor encounters his old friend Drax in &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot; (1979), Drax says it has been 450 years since their time together at the academy, suggesting only that Drax was 450 years younger, but implying nothing about the Doctor&#x27;s age, since it could have been a different amount of time for him. Drax implies that the Doctor got his doctorate after that. In &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; (1977), the Fourth Doctor states he is 750 years old.

In &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (1985), the Sixth Doctor said that he was &quot;a 900-year-old Time Lord&quot;, and in &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; (1987), the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s age was 953, the same as villainous Time Lady the Rani (in both serials, the Doctor&#x27;s age is stated in dialogue). In &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1988), the Seventh Doctor said that he had &quot;900 years&#x27; experience&quot; rewiring alien equipment. In the 1996 television movie, the Seventh Doctor has a 900-year diary in his TARDIS.

Amongst the works of spin-off prose fiction, in the Fourth Doctor comic &quot;The Time Witch&quot;, after the Doctor and Sharon cross through the split in time which ages them four years, the Doctor says &quot;I shall still think of myself as 743 ... or was it 730, I never can remember...&quot;. The Sixth Doctor celebrated his 991st birthday in the short story &quot;Brief Encounter: A Wee Deoch an..?&quot;, written by Colin Baker, in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special 1991&quot;: &quot;UNIT Exposed&quot;. The Seventh Doctor celebrated his 1,000th birthday in &quot;Set Piece&quot; by Kate Orman, and the Eighth Doctor declared his age to be 1,012 in &quot;Vampire Science&quot; by Orman and Jonathan Blum. The Eighth Doctor spent nearly a century on Earth during a story arc spread over several novels, and around 100 years asleep in &quot;The Sleep of Reason&quot; by Martin Day. In the Big Finish Productions audio play &quot;Orbis&quot;, the Eighth Doctor says that he has spent 600 years living on the planet Orbis since the previous play. He states that he lost count of his true age long ago, and rounds it down, taking into account the varying lengths of a &quot;year&quot; in different locations.

In the 2005 series, the Ninth Doctor&#x27;s age is stated in publicity materials as 900 years, and in &quot;Aliens of London&quot;, he says, &quot;Nine hundred years of time and space, and I&#x27;ve never been slapped by someone&#x27;s mother.&quot; Rose follows up by asking him if he is 900 years old, and he replies affirmatively. He restates this in &quot;The Empty Child&quot; as &quot;Nine hundred years of phone box travel and it&#x27;s the only thing left that surprises me.&quot; In &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (2007), the Tenth Doctor states that he is 903 years of age, the first time since &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; that an exact number has been stated in dialogue; previously, the Master indicated the Doctor&#x27;s age to be about 900 in &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;/&quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; (2007) story arc.

In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;, the Master ages the Doctor by 100 years using his laser screwdriver, leaving the Doctor with an elderly appearance. In &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;, the Master states to the population of Earth that the Doctor is nine hundred years old, and informs his subjects he will show them the Doctor&#x27;s true form, suspending his ability to regenerate. The Master proceeds to age the Doctor further with his laser screwdriver, reducing him to a tiny, wrinkled being, subsequently imprisoned inside a bird cage until reverted to his current form with the help of Martha Jones, 15 satellites and the entire population of Earth. However, as the resolution of that story is by means of a reversal of time, there is a suggestion that the events of that year never actually took place, and yet are present in the Doctor&#x27;s memory.

In &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009–2010), the Tenth Doctor tells Wilfred Mott he is 906 years old. In &quot;Flesh and Stone&quot; (2010), the Eleventh Doctor tells Amy Pond that he is 907. &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot; (2011) depicts the Doctor from two different points in his life, one at age 909 and the other at 1103. In &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2011), the TARDIS, while embodied as Idris, says the Doctor has been travelling with her for 700 years. By the end of series six, the Doctor has reached the age of 1103, the older version that appeared in &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot;. The next series ages the Doctor further, with &quot;A Town Called Mercy&quot; (2012) establishing that he is now approximately 1,200 years old. However, in &quot;The Bells of Saint John&quot; (2013), the Doctor says that he is &quot;one thousand years old&quot;, whilst in &quot;Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS&quot; (2013) he comments that he has piloted the TARDIS &quot;for over 900 years&quot;.

In the 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), the Eleventh Doctor is queried about his age by his younger self, to which he replies &quot;I dunno, I lose track. Twelve hundred and something I think, unless I&#x27;m lying. I can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;m lying about my age — that&#x27;s how old I am.&quot; He makes several references to being 400 years older than the War Doctor, which would encompass the timelines of the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. In the next episode, &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, the Doctor spends centuries defending the planet Trenzalore. After one interval, the Doctor states he has lived there for 300 years. Another long interval passes, during which the Doctor&#x27;s age is not given, but he physically ages considerably before regenerating into the Twelfth Doctor. The 2014 e-book &quot;Tales of Trenzalore&quot; states the Doctor spent 900 years on Trenzalore.

In the following episode, &quot;Deep Breath&quot; (2014), the Twelfth Doctor states that he is over 2,000 years old. However, writer Steven Moffat clarified: &quot;He&#x27;s lying. How could he know, unless he&#x27;s marking it on a wall? He could be 8,000 years old, he could be a million. He has no clue. The calendar will give him no clues.&quot; In the episode &quot;The Girl Who Died&quot;, the Doctor is shown to possess a 2000-year diary. Moffat later said that he believes the Doctor remembers all 4.5 billion years he spent dying and recreating himself in &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; (2015), and that the confession dial extracts the Doctor&#x27;s memories of each iteration, feeding them back to him as a means of torture. In a subsequent interview with &quot;SFX&quot;, Moffat confirmed, &quot;Technically he&#x27;s four and a half billion years old.&quot;

==Romance==
=== Original series ===
The first episode establishes that Susan Foreman is the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter; however, neither Susan nor the Doctor ever speaks of her parents.

The First Doctor did flirt with — and was accidentally engaged to — the character Cameca in &quot;The Aztecs&quot; (1964). Although this was part of a plot to get the TARDIS back, there was a hint of mutual attraction in Hartnell&#x27;s performance (especially as he is ultimately unable to leave behind the love token she has given him).

The Third Doctor expresses hurt feelings when his companion Jo Grant leaves him for an idealistic scientific adventurer whom she describes as &quot;a younger version&quot; of the Doctor (&quot;The Green Death&quot;). Jo kisses the Doctor on the cheek before she departs, the second time this form of affection was shown on screen (the Second Doctor having similarly kissed Zoe in &quot;The War Games&quot;).

There was on-screen chemistry between Tom Baker&#x27;s Fourth Doctor and his wife-to-be Lalla Ward&#x27;s Second Romana. A 1980 television commercial broadcast in Australia for Prime Computers showed Baker and Ward romancing each other in character as the Doctor and Romana, with the Doctor (prompted by the computer) proposing marriage.

In voiceovers on Peter Davison&#x27;s DVDs, the matter of physical affection is discussed. According to Davison and Matthew Waterhouse (Adric), producer John Nathan-Turner had very strict rules laid down about how the companions were allowed to physically interact with the Doctor, and Adric was allowed more physical contact with the Doctor than the female companions to downplay potential romantic and/or sexual connotations.

===Revived series===
Beginning in 2005, the programme has suggested that the Doctor has romantic feelings towards different people. This shift is satirised in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; wherein the War Doctor, having witnessed a passionate kiss exchanged between the Tenth Doctor and Queen Elizabeth I, asks of the Eleventh Doctor, &quot;Is there a lot of this in the future?&quot; to which he replies, &quot;It does start to happen, yeah.&quot;

The series has played with the idea of a romantic relationship between the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler, with many characters assuming they were a couple. Rose&#x27;s boyfriend Mickey Smith clearly views the Doctor as a romantic rival for whom Rose has left him. Each shows flashes of jealousy when the other flirts with other characters. In &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s male companion Jack Harkness kisses both the Doctor and Rose in what he believes is a last goodbye. In the same episode, the Doctor kisses Rose Tyler to get the time vortex energy that was killing her back into the TARDIS, subsequently &quot;killing&quot; him and causing his next regeneration.

In the New Series Adventures novel &quot;Only Human&quot; by Gareth Roberts, Rose asks the Doctor how he would know that marrying for love is overrated, to which he cryptically answers, &quot;Who says I don&#x27;t? You ask the Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.&quot; In a December 2005 interview on BBC Four, actor David Tennant, who had just taken the role of the Tenth Doctor, described the relationship between the Doctor and Rose as &quot;basically a love story without the shagging&quot;. He later stated that Rose was the Doctor&#x27;s girlfriend, though it was never explicitly stated on screen.

The Doctor&#x27;s relationship with Rose intensifies after he regenerates into the Tenth Doctor. In &quot;New Earth&quot;, Rose&#x27;s body is temporarily inhabited by Cassandra, who kisses the Doctor romantically. This is one of the few scenes in the entire programme where the Doctor is kissed romantically by his companion. In &quot;School Reunion&quot; (2006), the arrival of the Doctor&#x27;s previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. The Doctor also expresses dismay at having his companions age while he regenerates. In the episode, &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot; (written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor develops a romantic relationship with Madame de Pompadour, with whom he shares a passionate kiss. She even takes him away to &quot;dance&quot;, but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode &quot;The Doctor Dances&quot;) is taken is not seen on screen. In the novel &quot;The Stone Rose&quot;, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, with it being described as &quot;a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive&quot;. In &quot;The Impossible Planet&quot; (2006), the Doctor and Rose share an awkward moment when they have to consider settling down in one time period and Rose suggests they do so together. She later plants a kiss for good luck on the Doctor&#x27;s spacesuit prior to his descent into the pit. In &quot;The Satan Pit&quot; the Doctor, fearing for his life, tells someone &quot;If you see Rose, tell her... tell her... oh, she knows.&quot; In &quot;Doomsday&quot;, when the Doctor says his goodbye to Rose, she finally tells him that she loves him. He begins to reply, but the message is cut off, and he is unable to reciprocate; in the episode&#x27;s audio commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner had stated that &quot;he absolutely was going to say it... he was going to tell her he loved her.&quot;

Executive producer Russell T Davies states in &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; that the reunion between the Doctor and Rose in &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; is a parody of romantic film conventions because the heightened emotional content is abruptly interrupted by the Doctor being shot by a Dalek. In the next episode, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, Rose challenges the Doctor to say what he did not get to say before, to which he replies, &quot;Does it need saying?&quot; His half-human duplicate, however, does whisper it into Rose&#x27;s ear, and the two of them kiss; Rose gets an emphatically romantic resolution to her romance storyline, as the duplicate Doctor and Rose continue to live together on a parallel Earth. Gardner commented in &quot;Confidential&quot; that although the audience cannot hear, it is obvious that he is saying &quot;I love you&quot;.

Throughout series three (2007), companion Martha Jones pines for the Doctor&#x27;s affection following a kiss between them which was only used as a &quot;genetic transfer&quot; to distract their pursuers. She is distraught when, temporarily turned into a human in &quot;Human Nature&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s human persona, John Smith, falls in love with nurse Joan Redfern. She admits in &quot;The Family of Blood&quot; to Smith that &quot;[the Doctor] is everything to me, and he doesn&#x27;t even look at me, but I don&#x27;t care, because I love him to bits, and I hope to God he won&#x27;t remember me saying this.&quot; The Doctor tells Joan he is capable of everything that Smith was, but she rejects his attempt to establish a relationship with her as the Doctor. In the following episode, &quot;Blink&quot;, he says he is &quot;rubbish at weddings, especially my own&quot;. Martha eventually quits as the Doctor&#x27;s full-time companion in the series finale &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; because she is in love with the Doctor and he seems unable or unwilling to reciprocate; she received similar commiseration from Jack Harkness, who is also infatuated with him, in &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;.

Subsequently, in the 2008 series, the Doctor&#x27;s friendship with Donna Noble is strengthened, after the infatuations with Martha and Rose, by the knowledge that she has no romantic interest in him whatsoever. Davies&#x27; last clear allusion to the Doctor&#x27;s romantic capacity occurs at the beginning of his last episode as showrunner, &quot;The End of Time&quot;. The Tenth Doctor claims to have married &quot;Good Queen Bess, and let me tell you, her nickname is no longer... (clears throat)&quot;, a reference to Elizabeth I of England&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot;. The marriage, which is described as &quot;a mistake&quot;, explained Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reaction to seeing the Tenth Doctor in an earlier episode, &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot;. Subsequent episodes have alluded to this romantic, possibly sexual relationship. This relationship, including the marriage and the &quot;mistake&quot; that led to it (a case of mistaken identity involving a Zygon commander in 1562), eventually unfolds on screen in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;.

Episodes written by Moffat have continued to hint at the Doctor&#x27;s romantic capacity: his stories during the Russell T Davies tenure as showrunner included the admission of a sex life in &quot;The Doctor Dances&quot; and the romance with Madame de Pompadour in &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;, past marriages in &quot;Blink&quot;, and the introduction of recurring character River Song in the 2008 episodes &quot;Silence in the Library&quot;/&quot;Forest of the Dead&quot;, who indicates she is a lover of the Doctor. In his tenure as showrunner (2010–2017), the series continued to imply that the Doctor will have a relationship with, and perhaps marry, River Song. Additionally, Moffat has companion Amy Pond attempt to seduce the Doctor in &quot;Flesh and Stone&quot;, although he expresses shock at the idea, protesting that she was human. In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor finds himself accidentally engaged to film star Marilyn Monroe during a visit to 1950s Hollywood. The Doctor&#x27;s past romantic relationship with Elizabeth I is alluded to in Moffat episodes &quot;The Beast Below&quot; and &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, as well as in &quot;Amy&#x27;s Choice&quot; by Simon Nye.

In her 2010 appearances, River continues to hint at a relationship with the Doctor in her relative past and his relative future. In &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, River suggests to the Doctor that she is married to him in his personal future. When River kisses the Doctor in &quot;Day of the Moon&quot;, it becomes clear that whereas this is the Doctor&#x27;s first kiss with her, it is to be her last with him and that she shall soon be heading to The Library where she dies. In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;, River is seen returning from a date with the future Doctor, and repeatedly calls the present-day Doctor &quot;my love&quot;. In &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Hitler&quot;, a young River Song compares herself to Mrs. Robinson and kisses the Doctor; the first time in an attempt to kill him, the second to save his life. Later she resolves to study archaeology so that she can encounter the Doctor again. Because she loves him, she refuses to shoot him in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, creating an alternate timeline. In this world, the Doctor marries River in a very brief ceremony witnessed by Amy and Rory, so that he may allow time to return to normal and go to his death, while secretly disclosing to River that he will fake his death. Although the alternate timeline is erased, all future episodes act as though the wedding was real. Later, when Dorium comments that River is incarcerated in the Stormcage for &quot;all her days&quot;, the Doctor responds &quot;Her days, yes, her &quot;nights&quot;...well...that&#x27;s between her and me.&quot; After this episode, the banter and gentle sexual innuendo between them becomes less teasing and more serious.

In &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; (2013), the Doctor kisses a holographic projection of River Song, based on the copy of her mind archived in the great Library of the 51st century. During this episode, both the Doctor and River call her his wife. He reveals that the reason he has avoided mentioning her since her death was for fear that the memory would hurt too much – as River notes to colleagues, &quot;he hates endings&quot;. After this exchange, he bids her a final farewellbut at her requestphrasing it with the implication that they may meet again.

Despite this, the Doctor&#x27;s limited understanding of human romance and sexuality has been the subject of many jokes. For example, in &quot;Flesh and Stone&quot;, after being kissed by Amy Pond, his first response is to gasp, &quot;But you&#x27;re human!&quot;, and he later blithely mentions this embrace to her fiancé Rory in the following episode, &quot;The Vampires of Venice&quot;, not realising this would upset Rory. In &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, when he tells Amy and Rory that he is redoing the TARDIS&#x27;s guest room, they suggest, &quot;Perhaps not bunk beds this time&quot;, and he does not understand why a married couple would not find bunk beds preferable to other furniture. In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;, he is asked about Amy and Rory&#x27;s sex life and calls it &quot;private human stuff&quot;.

In &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; (2013), it is revealed that the Doctor, in an unspecified prior incarnation to the Eleventh, engaged in a romance with a woman named Tasha Lem. Their attraction appeared to continue when the Eleventh encountered her again, even after Lem was technically killed and made into a Dalek-human hybrid.

At first, the Twelfth Doctor explicitly rejected the idea of having a romantic relationship with his companion Clara Oswald. He implied that in his previous form, he had come to see himself as Clara&#x27;s &quot;boyfriend&quot; in an attempt to avoid confronting his extreme age and alien nature. Initially it was reported that Peter Capaldi told tabloids there would be &quot;no flirting&quot; between him and Clara, likening such a potential relationship to Papa and Nicole, but the actor himself discarded that. The episode &quot;Deep Breath&quot; introduces a character named Missy who identifies the Doctor as her boyfriend. Missy is later revealed to be a female incarnation of the Master. As the character of the Twelfth Doctor evolved, so did his relationship with Clara. In a spring 2015 interview, Steven Moffat indicated that the Doctor had never stopped being &quot;besotted&quot; with Clara, and that he &quot;loves them (companions) more than they love him&quot;. In a media roundtable interview at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con, Capaldi went further, saying the two were romantically involved, just not in the traditional sense, &quot;It&#x27;s romantic in the old sense. Two people who are really crazy about each other...&quot; The narrative of series nine culminated in a three-part story arc in which Clara dies and the Doctor spends the next 4.5 billion years executing a gambit to change history and save her life. Further romance for the Twelfth Doctor was depicted in the 2015 Christmas special, &quot;The Husbands of River Song&quot;, which had a romantic plot. In the special, the Twelfth Doctor meets his one-time wife, River Song, for the first (and, narratively, the last) time.

The Thirteenth Doctor experienced her first on-screen same-sex romantic situation with companion Yaz Khan, who admitted she was in love with her in &quot;Eve of the Daleks&quot; (2022). The Doctor confronts Yaz about them in &quot;Legend of the Sea Devils&quot;, saying she reciprocated Yaz&#x27;s affection while refusing to become involved with another human companion who would one day die.

In &quot;The Giggle&quot;, the Fifteenth Doctor admits to the Fourteenth Doctor that he loved Sarah Jane, Rose and River. In &quot;Rogue&quot;, the Fifteenth Doctor has a whirlwind romance the bounty hunter Rogue (Jonathan Groff). This marked the Doctor&#x27;s first televised male-male romance, and their second same-sex romance following Yaz.

===Other media===
The spin-off media both before and after the television movie have toyed with the idea in various ways. In the 1995 Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Human Nature&quot; by Paul Cornell, the Seventh Doctor takes on the human guise of &quot;Dr John Smith&quot; and has a romance with a teacher named Joan in 1914, albeit as a means to understand the human condition and with the Doctor&#x27;s own memories as a Time Lord suppressed. The relationship ended when the Doctor was restored to normal, admitting to Joan that he knows that Smith was fond of her but unable to reciprocate those feelings himself. This novel was adapted to the screen and comprised two episodes in the new programme: &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;The Family of Blood&quot;, featuring the Tenth Doctor, with the Doctor implying that he retained Smith&#x27;s feelings for Joan, although the more traumatic nature of the transformation may have impacted his feelings after he returned to normal.

In the Virgin novel &quot;Death and Diplomacy&quot;, by Dave Stone, the Seventh Doctor implies that he intentionally creates an image of asexuality to keep things simple.

The concluding chapter of &quot;The Dying Days&quot;, an Eighth Doctor novel by Lance Parkin, strongly implies intimacy occurring between the Doctor and Bernice Summerfield. This encounter was later confirmed in the audio drama &quot;Benny&#x27;s Story&quot;, a chapter of the Big Finish Productions release &quot;The Company of Friends&quot;, marking the only time to date that a classic-era Doctor has been confirmed as sleeping with one of his companions.

Writer Lawrence Miles has stated that he believes the Eighth Doctor has sex with I. M. Foreman between the events of his novels &quot;Interference – Book One&quot; and &quot;Interference – Book Two&quot;. In &quot;Book Two&quot;, the Doctor explains that he has become interested in romance and the idea of being close to someone in his current body, but that he is reluctant to explore these feelings with his companions because of the emotional baggage a relationship with him would bring.

In various novels – especially &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; – it is established that Time Lords do not reproduce sexually, but emerge from genetic Looms fully grown, though the same book hints that the Doctor&#x27;s birth was an exception. (Unlike his cousins, he has a belly button.) Lance Parkin&#x27;s novels &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Infinity Doctors&quot; (1998) suggest that &quot;wombborn&quot; families have survived in secret, and that the Doctor and the Master were born to these families. In the 1996 film &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the Doctor states he is &quot;half-human, on [his] mother&#x27;s side&quot;, which the Master also affirms. The revived programme portrays Time Lord children, with a child version of the Doctor appearing in the 2014 episode &quot;Listen&quot;.

In the Big Finish Productions audio play &quot;Loups-Garoux&quot;, the Fifth Doctor reluctantly agrees to marry the werewolf Ileana De Santos and, although he gets out of it later, as in Cameca&#x27;s case, a degree of mutual attraction is present. In the audio plays involving the Eighth Doctor, his companion Charley confesses her romantic feelings for him in &quot;Zagreus&quot;, but, although he admits he loves her at the time, it is a highly dramatic moment and the relationship does not progress beyond the platonic.

The recurring novel and audio character Iris Wildthyme, created by Paul Magrs, is first introduced in the &quot;Short Trips&quot; story &quot;Old Flames&quot;, is a past romantic interest of the Doctor&#x27;s who continues to flirt with him whenever they meet. More of the Doctor&#x27;s past relationships are explored in &quot;The Infinity Doctors&quot; and &quot;Cold Fusion&quot;.

The question of romance is sometimes sidestepped with plot devices in the spin-off media. In the 2001 BBC Books novel &quot;Father Time&quot; by Lance Parkin, the Doctor adopts an orphaned Gallifreyan-like alien called Miranda. It is implied that Miranda is actually the daughter of the Doctor himself from the far future. Miranda returns in the novel &quot;Sometime Never...&quot; by Justin Richards, with her own daughter Zezanne. At that novel&#x27;s end, a time-active being called Soul travels into the past accompanied by Zezanne, the two believing themselves to be the Doctor and Susan, respectively.

In &quot;The One Doctor&quot;, the Doctor kisses Sally-Anne Stubbins to bluff to the Sussyurat that he was not the Doctor but Banto Zane; this kiss showed no affection.

==Reception==
The character of the Doctor has been generally well received by the public. In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4, the Doctor was ranked sixth on its list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; dubbed the Doctor &quot;Britain&#x27;s favourite alien&quot;, noting the character&#x27;s enduring popularity, while abroad the character has come to be seen as a British cultural icon. UGO Networks listed the Doctor as one of their best heroes of all time.

<text>The Nokia 3510 is a mobile phone for the GSM network, introduced by Nokia on 12 March 2002. The phone was the first Nokia phone to bring GPRS internet services to the mass market. It was also the first Nokia phone to ship with Beatnik&#x27;s miniBAE engine, allowing for playback of polyphonic ringtones.

GPRS is used for data transmission and mobile Internet WAP service. The Nokia 3510i model supports Java 2 ME that makes it possible for users to download and use Java applications, background images and polyphonic ringtones. The phone supports SMS and MMS messaging.

== Variants ==
An enhanced version, Nokia 3510i, was introduced some time later on 6 September 2002 and released in December 2002. It was one of the first phones with a color display. The phone has a Nokia Series 40 96 x 65 user interface. It was sold in Europe, Russia, Middle East and Africa, while the Nokia 3530 was sold in Asia-Pacific, which operate on GSM 900/1800, and features a more conventional keypad.

Another variant, the Nokia 3590, was released to the North American market in 2003. It operates on GSM-1900 and GSM-850 networks. The phone was at one time available through the former AT&amp;T GoPhone prepaid mobile phone service. The Nokia 3560 was also released the same year, with a different keypad, and operating on TDMA and AMPS for roaming. IS-136. It was sold until early 2004, when TDMA accounts were no longer being activated. This was followed by the Nokia 3595, featuring a different keypad and instead operating on GSM-1900 and GSM-850 networks.

Yet another variant, the Nokia 3585, was released in 2002, sporting a 96x65 pixel grayscale display that operates on CDMA2000 1X network. There is an enhanced model, the Nokia 3585i.

<text>Edward Hasted (20 December 1732 OS – 14 January 1812) was an English antiquarian and pioneering historian of his ancestral home county of Kent. As such, he was the author of a major county history, &quot;The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent&quot; (1778–99).

==Life==
Hasted was born in Lombard Street, London, the son of Edward Hasted (1702–1740) of Sutton-at-Hone, near Dartford, Kent by his wife, Ann Tyler. His grandfather, Joseph Hasted (1662–1732), had been employed as chief painter at the Royal Navy&#x27;s Chatham dockyard, but he was also a skilled financier, and amassed a considerable private estate and income. Hasted&#x27;s father, Edward, became a wealthy barrister, and the young Edward Hasted was educated at Darent (1737–40), The King&#x27;s School, Rochester (1740–44). From there, he went to Eton College (1744–48), and a school in Esher (1748–50). After completing his education, he was a student for a short time at Lincolns Inn, although he was not called to the bar.

Hasted returned to his parents&#x27; home in Sutton-at-Hone, and, in July 1755, married Anne, Dorman, the daughter of a neighbour. In May 1766, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Hasted acquired The Knights Hospitaller&#x27;s manor house of St. John&#x27;s Jerusalem; and it was here that he wrote his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. He attended the local church regularly, and also sat on the West Kent Quarter Sessions bench at Maidstone. The couple had two daughters and five sons, one of whom was also named Edward. In 1770, they moved to Canterbury, where they lived until 1789, by which time his finances were in total confusion. Although he sold off some of his estates, he sank deeper into debt. In 1790, he left his wife Anne, and fled to France with another woman. There he remained until the war with Napoleon drove him back home and into debtors&#x27; prison for almost seven years.

Released in 1802, Hasted lived in poverty for five years until he was given the Mastership of Lady Hungerford&#x27;s Almshouse in Corsham, Wiltshire, by his friend William Bouverie, 1st Earl of Radnor. Hasted remained Master of the Almshouse from 1807 until his death in 1812, aged 79.

==Works==
&quot;The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent&quot; was first published in four folio volumes between 1778 and 1799.

A second edition appeared in 12 octavo volumes between 1797 and 1801. It incorporated much new material, but also omitted many details from the first edition: it had been greatly revised by either one or two unidentified editors, and the extent to which it drew on materials collected by Hasted, or to which he was able to influence the work, remains unclear. A modern reprint of the second edition was published in 1972.

Hasted also published a separate &quot;History of the Antient and Metropolitical City of Canterbury Civil and Ecclesiastical&quot; (1799).

<text>Livvi-Karelian (Alternate names: &quot;Liygi&quot;, &quot;Livvi&quot;, &quot;Livvikovian&quot;, &quot;Olonets&quot;, &quot;Southern Olonetsian&quot;, &quot;Karelian&quot;; ) is a supradialect of Karelian, which is a Finnic language of the Uralic family, spoken by Olonets Karelians (self-appellation &#x27;, &#x27;), traditionally inhabiting the area between Ladoga and Onega lakes, northward of Svir River. The name &quot;Olonets Karelians&quot; is derived from the territory inhabited, Olonets Krai, named after the town of Olonets, named after the Olonka River.

==History==

Before World War II, Livvi-Karelian was spoken both in Russia and in Finland, in the easternmost part of Finnish Karelia. After Finland was forced to cede large parts of Karelia to the USSR after the war, the Finnish Livvi-Karelian population was resettled in Finland. Today there are still native speakers of Livvi-Karelian living scattered throughout Finland, but all areas in which Livvi-Karelian remains a community language are found in Russia.

Speakers of Livvi-Karelian may be found mainly in Olonetsky, Pryazhinsky, Pitkyarantsky, and partly Suoyarvsky districts of the Republic of Karelia. Livvi-Karelian long remained relatively uninfluenced by the Russian language despite the large influx of Russians following the founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
=== Consonants ===
* Consonants may also occur as geminated or long .
* Sounds are commonly heard from Russian loanwords.
* can have allophones of or .
* is heard as when preceding or .
* Palatalization may occur among different dialects when consonants are preceding vowels .

== Alphabet ==
Livvi-Karelian uses the Latin alphabet and has the following letters in its alphabet, which is called the Karelian alphabet: Aa, Bb, Cc, Čč, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg, Hh, Ii, Jj, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, Oo, Pp, Rr, Ss, Šš, Zz, Žž, Tt, Uu, Vv, Yy, Ää, Öö.

Until 2007, the ü letter was a part of the Livvi-Karelian alphabet, which has been recommended by the Karelian language board to be instead be changed to the y letter.

==Grammar==
Livvi-Karelian and its grammatical cases are quite similar to the Finnish language and other related Finnic languages.

<text>The Derby Hall is a Victorian neo-classical building situated on Market Street in the centre of Bury, Greater Manchester, England. It is a Grade II listed building.

==History==
The Derby Hall was built in the late 1840s at the instigation of Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. It was designed by Sydney Smirke, an architect best known today for his work on the circular reading room at the British Museum. The building has a central Venetian window and a pedimented portico with four attached columns.

It was originally the central part of a larger development that included the Derby Hotel on the left, and the Athenaeum on the right (both also designed by Smirke). These other two buildings were demolished in 1965 and 1971, respectively. Construction of the building began at Christmas 1848 and was completed in October 1850. The hall was opened on 6 November 1850 with a concert which was attended by 600 people.

The building was originally known as the &quot;Public Rooms&quot;, although it quickly became known as the Town Hall. At its opening, it contained a magistrate&#x27;s court, a police station, the Earl of Derby&#x27;s estate offices and a large assembly room. Stanley hoped the building would become the meeting place for Bury&#x27;s council; however, owing to a disagreement between the earl and the local authority, it was not initially used for that purpose. After the First World War the council acquired the building from the Stanley family and used it as a council building. The council moved to the new Town Hall on Knowsley Street in 1954 and, since 1979, the building has been operated by a registered charity called Bury Metropolitan Arts Association, which uses it as a theatre and concert venue known as The Met.

One notable concert held in the building was by rock band Joy Division on 8 April 1980, which descended into a riot after some of the audience started throwing bottles at the stage. This was because Alan Hempstall of Crispy Ambulance and Simon Topping of A Certain Ratio filled in on vocals, since Joy Division&#x27;s own lead singer Ian Curtis was recovering from an attempted suicide attempt the previous day.

<doc id="959737" wikidata="Q255300" url="?curid=959737" title="Galina Ustvolskaya">
<text>Galina Ivanovna Ustvolskaya ( , was a Russian composer of classical music. 

Known as ‘the lady with the hammer’, her music has been described as demanding “everything from the performer&quot;, uncompromising in her trademark textured homophonic blocks of sound. Ustvolskaya created her own unique style, characterized by unusual combinations of instruments that created highly specific tone clusters and textures and her large dynamic ranges. 

A highly private person, she chose to live her life largely outside of the public eye, rarely conducting interviews as she found it unpleasant to talk about her own music. In her lifetime, she only approved 21 of her works for performance. 

== Early Years ==
Born in Petrograd (modern day St. Petersburg), Ustvolskaya’s mother was a school teacher and her father was a lawyer. She loved music from a young age and, despite her impoverished childhood. showed an exceptional gift after beginning to study music at the age of seven. 

She was enrolled in a music-orientated secondary school to study piano, and was later accepted to the Leningrad Conservatory in 1937. 

== Middle Years ==
Ustvolskaya studied at the college attached to the Conservatory (later renamed the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory) from 1937 to 1939; she was the only female student in Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s composition class at the Conservatory. 

Shostakovich sent some of his own unfinished works to Ustvolskaya, attaching great value to her comments. Some of these pieces contain quotations from his pupil&#x27;s compositions; for example, he employed the second theme of the Finale of her clarinet trio throughout the Fifth String Quartet and in the Michelangelo Suite (no. 9).

Ustvolskaya was a pupil of Shostakovich from 1939 to 1941 and from 1947 to 1948, with the six-year break coinciding with the war and the two-and-a-half-year siege of Leningrad (modern day St. Petersburg). 

The exact nature of her relationship with Shostakovich has been unclear. In an interview for the TV program &quot;Tsarskaya&quot; &quot;Lozha,&quot; which celebrated Ustvolskaya&#x27;s 80th birthday, she said, &quot;It is sad that Shostakovich and myself were not ‘soul mates’; I know that he liked me and always treated me with respect, but I never reciprocated his feelings.&quot; She has also revealed that her former teacher once proposed to her, but she did not accept.&quot;&quot;

Despite this earlier proximity, she vehemently rejected Shostakovich’s impact on her later in her life and made it clear that she did not want any association with Shostakovich, calling his music “dry and lifeless” and writing to her publisher, “One thing remains as clear as day: a seemingly eminent figure such as Shostakovich, to me, is not eminent at all, on the contrary, he burdened my life and killed my best feelings.”

Ustvolskaya’s early works over the 1930s and 40s showed many similarities to the socialist realism and modernism prevalent in the Soviet Union at the time, necessitated through the Soviet Union’s systematic censorship of any music that failed to fully support the state from 1948 onwards. 

After this, she composed propaganda pieces acceptable to the Soviet leadership while also secretly writing works she thought might never be heard in her own unique style. None of her own ‘true’ works were performed until 1961; previously, she worked to destroy all trace of anything she’d written, as in her earlier years her music had been featured for Soviet propaganda films.

==Later Years==
The middle of the 1960s witnessed greater tolerance for modernist music, and interest in Ustvolskaya grew. As a result of this, the Leningrad Union of Composers organized performances of her music in the late 70s, which received high praise from listeners and critics. 

During this period, she composed many works as part of the younger generation of composers that explored more Western techniques, such as aleatoric and 12-tone music. 

From 1947 till 1977 she taught composition at Leningrad Conservatory. She allegedly spent time working in a military hospital during this period as well. She taught her students to write polyphonically and contrapuntally, showing them works from Mahler, Stravinsky, and her previous teacher Shostakovich. Her students were predominantly male, with many of them infatuated by her. Her teaching style was more focused on aesthetics and feeling instead of harmony or scientific technique, and often encouraged students to experiment with modes instead of the typical major or minor scales.

Widespread recognition came after her music was performed in several concerts of the 1989 Holland Festival. 

==Style==
Ustvolskaya developed her own style, of which she said, &quot;There is no link whatsoever between my music and that of any other composer, living or dead.&quot; Among its characteristics are the use of repeated, homophonic blocks of soundwhich prompted the Dutch critic Elmer Schönberger to call her &quot;the lady with the hammer&quot;unusual combinations of instruments (such as eight double basses, piano and percussion in her Composition No. 2); use of extreme dynamics (as in her Piano Sonata No. 6); the employment of groups of instruments to introduce tone clusters; sparse harmonic textures; and the use of piano or percussion to beat out unchanging rhythms. Ustvolskaya&#x27;s music has been described by critics and scholars as carrying “the bleakness of one who stares into the void on a regular basis” and as evoking “visceral feelings of horror.” Many have attributed influences to her work, all of which Ustvolskaya has denied.

Despite being a highly private person, Galina Ustvolskaya commented publicly on the spiritual aspects of her music. She often incorporated religious texts, especially in her later works, though she insisted that none of her pieces conform to the beliefs of a specific religious sect. In an interview, her friend and publisher Viktor Suslin stated that her music is not liturgical and should not be labelled as religious, but rather that it “springs directly from the contact she feels with God.” When discussing her compositional process, Ustvolskaya once said that she only composed when she “fell into a state of grace” inspired by God and that “each work has a very long period of coming into being, after which she simply writes it down.” When offered a commission, she wrote: “If God gives me the opportunity to compose something, then I will do it without fail.” Although it is unclear whether Ustvolskaya was a member of a religious community, it is evident that she was greatly inspired by her spiritual connection to God and that it was integral to her compositional process.

The music of Galina Ustvolskaya was not openly censured in the USSR. However, she was accused of being unwilling to communicate and of &quot;narrowness&quot; and &quot;obstinacy&quot;.

Though many who knew Ustvolskaya perceive the Western sentiment toward her compositions to be one of rebellion and grandiosity, with pianist Oleg Malov even calling her methods a totalitarian fight against Soviet Russia&#x27;s totalitarian regime - resulting in &#x27;double totalitarianism&#x27;. While her propensity for a grandiose attitude was seemingly present in her personal life, and noted by several students and colleagues, she never composed &quot;for the table&quot; (for money) and mainly thought of herself and her music as being misunderstood by those around her.

It has long been speculated that Ustvolskaya hid or destroyed compositions that did not meet the government&#x27;s expectations of socialist realism for music, however she stated in an interview with biographer Olga Gladkova - whose book &quot;Galina Ustvolskaya: Music as Obsession&quot; seemingly has a controversial reputation amongst Ustvolskaya&#x27;s contemporaries - that her main source of inspiration was God, claiming, &quot;I begin to write when I enter a special state of grace. Music is born in me, and when the time comes, I record it. If the time doesn&#x27;t come, I destroy it.&quot; But, when asked if she viewed her own compositions as Russian national (or nationalistic), Ustvolskaya noted that Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Bach, and Beethoven are not mainly associated with their nationalities and that their art is &quot;higher&quot; than such labels. She continued, &quot;I only accept such work, meaning all types of art.&quot;

Moreover, one of Ustvolskaya&#x27;s contemporaries, pianist Tatyana Voronina, likened the former&#x27;s compositional style to a prisoner&#x27;s shackles. In an interview, Voronina said that Ustvolskaya&#x27;s use of rhythmic, repeating crotchets expressed a ‘dark, somewhat schizophrenic worldview.’ This sentiment was echoed by Soviet musicologist Ekaterina Ruchevskaya, who claimed of Ustvolskaya&#x27;s alleged mental instability, &quot;Whether or not there were some mental problems, I cannot say for sure, but I knew of one suicide attempt [...] She also had two students, one of whom, Alesha Nikolaev, an incredibly gifted boy, committed suicide aged 18&quot;.

==In literature==
Ustvolskaya&#x27;s relationship with Shostakovich from her time as a student through the 1950s is fictionalized in William T. Vollmann&#x27;s National Book Award-winning historical novel &quot;Europe Central&quot;.

==Legacy and remembrance==
Ustvolskaya stopped composing in 1991, and spent the last fifteen years of her life living an ascetic, monastic life, rarely leaving St Petersburg or Russia other than for performances of her work (1995 and 96 in Amsterdam, 1998 in Vienna, 1999 in Bern and 2004 in Bastad). She still remained extremely invested in her music, often delivering scathing critiques of performances that did not meet her standards. In 1998 she gave a description of her life to an interviewer that serves as a kind of thesis statement about her music:

“The works written by me were often hidden for long periods. But then if they did not satisfy me, I destroyed them. I do not have drafts; I compose at the table, without an instrument. Everything is thought out with such care that it only needs to be written down. I’m always in my thoughts. I spend the nights thinking as well, and therefore do not have time to relax. Thoughts gnaw [at] me. My world possesses me completely, and I understand everything in my own way. I hear, I see, and I act differently from others. I just live my lonely life.”

Ustvolskaya died on the 22nd December, 2006 in Saint Petersburg, leaving behind her prolific and infamous legacy as the &quot;Lady with the Hammer.&quot; Her manuscripts are stored in the archive of the Paul Sacher Stiftung since 1994.

<doc id="959741" wikidata="Q657083" url="?curid=959741" title="History of Doctor Who">
<text>&quot;Doctor Who&quot; is a British television science fiction series, produced and screened by the BBC on the BBC TV channel from 1963 to 1964, and on BBC1 (later BBC One) from 1964 to 1989 and since 2005. A one-off television film, co-produced with Universal Pictures was screened on the Fox Network in the United States in 1996.

==Origins==
In March 1962, Eric Maschwitz, the Assistant and Adviser to the Controller of Programmes at BBC Television, asked Donald Wilson, the Head of the Script Department, to have his department&#x27;s Survey Group prepare a study on the feasibility of the BBC producing a new science fiction television series. The report was prepared by staff members Alice Frick and Donald Bull, and delivered the following month, much to the commendation of Wilson, Maschwitz and the BBC&#x27;s Assistant Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock. A follow-up report into specific ideas for the format of such a programme was commissioned and delivered in July. Prepared by Frick with another Script Department staff member, John Braybon, this report recommended a series dealing with time travel as being an idea particularly worthy of development.

In December, Canadian-born Sydney Newman arrived at BBC Television as the new Head of Drama. Newman was a science fiction fan who had overseen several such productions in his previous positions at ABC Weekend TV and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In March 1963, he was made aware by Baverstock – now promoted to Chief of Programmes – of a gap in the schedule on Saturday evenings between the sports showcase &quot;Grandstand&quot; and the pop music programme &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;. Ideally, any programme scheduled here would appeal to children that had previously been accustomed to the timeslot, the teenaged audience of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;, and the adult sports fan audience of &quot;Grandstand&quot;. Newman decided that a science fiction programme would be perfect to fill the gap, and enthusiastically took up the existing Script Department research, initiating a brainstorming session chaired by Wilson and including Braybon, Frick and another BBC staff writer, C. E. Webber.

Webber&#x27;s first outline document about the series, dated 29 March 1963, envisioned the show, tentatively titled &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot;, being driven by a group of Earth-based, contemporary humans who are constantly conflicting with a recurring foe. Newman would then personally come up with the idea of an educational series featuring a time machine larger on the inside than the outside and the idea of the central character, the mysterious &quot;Dr. Who&quot;; he may also have given the series the same title. However, in a 1971 interview Donald Wilson claimed to have named the series, and when this claim was put to Newman he did not dispute it.

Webber&#x27;s second outline, now calling the series &quot;Dr. Who&quot;, followed an amnesiac &quot;frail old man lost in space and time&quot; with a machine which enables him &quot;to travel together through time, through space, and through matter.&quot; The character of Dr. Who was described as being &quot;suspicious and capable of sudden malignance&quot;, disliking his other supporting characters, and hating scientific progress, with the secret mission to meddle with time and destroy the future, while his time machine was described as &quot;unreliable&quot; and being invisible. Sydney Newman penciled in a rejection of the character&#x27;s description, as he didn&#x27;t want the main character of the series to be &quot;a reactionary&quot;, but a &quot;father figure&quot; who would &quot;take science, applied and theoretical, as being as natural as eating&quot;. He also disliked the idea of an invisible time machine, saying that a &quot;tangible symbol&quot; was needed, but was enthusiastic about the idea of the time machine&#x27;s unreliability. In addition, Webber suggested ways Dr. Who&#x27;s identity could develop. He suggested Bethlehem as a location for a Christmas story and Dr. Who as Merlin, as Jacob Marley, and his wife as Cinderella&#x27;s godmother chasing her husband through time. Newman wasn&#x27;t keen on the proposed direction for the series, writing, &quot;I don&#x27;t like this much - it reads silly and condescending. It doesn&#x27;t get across the basis of teaching of educational experience - drama based upon and stemming from factual material and scientific phenomena and actual social history of past and future.&quot;

The final memo detailing the format of the series, written by Wilson, Webber, and Newman and dated 16 May 1963, described the character of Dr. Who as a &quot;650 years old&quot; man whose &quot;watery blue eyes are continually looking around in bewilderment and occasionally a look of utter malevolence clouds his face as he suspects his earthly friends of being part of some conspiracy&quot;. He &quot;seems not to remember where he comes from but he has flashes of garbled memory which indicate that he was involved in a galactic war and still fears pursuit by some undefined enemy&quot;. His ship is also described as &quot;a police telephone box [...] but anyone entering it finds himself inside an extensive electronic contrivance. Though it looks impressive, it is an old beat-up model which Dr. Who stole when he escaped from his own galaxy in the year 5733; it is uncertain in performance; moreover, Dr. Who isn&#x27;t quite sure how to work it, so they have to learn by trial and error.&quot; Later in the year production was initiated and handed over to producer Verity Lambert and story editor David Whitaker to oversee, after a brief period when the show had been handled by a &quot;caretaker&quot; producer, Rex Tucker. Concerned about Lambert&#x27;s relative lack of experience, Wilson appointed the experienced staff director Mervyn Pinfield as associate producer. Australian staff writer Anthony Coburn also contributed, penning the very first episode from a draft initially prepared by Webber.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; was originally intended to be an educational series, with the TARDIS taking the form of an object from that particular episode&#x27;s time period (a column in Ancient Greece, a sarcophagus in Egypt, etc.). When the show&#x27;s budget was calculated, however, it was discovered that it was prohibitively expensive to re-dress the TARDIS model for each episode; instead, the TARDIS&#x27;s &quot;Chameleon Circuit&quot; was said to be malfunctioning, giving the prop its characteristic &#x27;police-box&#x27; appearance.

The series&#x27; theme music was written by film and television composer Ron Grainer (who would later go on to also compose the theme to &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, among others) in collaboration with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. While Grainer wrote the theme, it was Delia Derbyshire who was responsible for its creation, using a series of tape recorders to laboriously cut and join the individual sounds she created with both concrete sources and square- and sine-wave oscillators. Grainer was amazed at the results and asked &quot;Did I write that?&quot; when he heard it. Derbyshire replied that he mostly had. The BBC (who wanted to keep members of the Workshop anonymous) prevented Derbyshire from getting a co-composer credit and half the royalties. The title sequence logo was designed by graphics designer Bernard Lodge, with the sequence itself realised by electronic effects specialist Norman Taylor.

==1960s==
===First Doctor===

After actors Hugh David (later a director on the series) and Geoffrey Bayldon had both turned down approaches to star in the series, Verity Lambert and the first serial&#x27;s director Waris Hussein managed to persuade 55-year-old character actor William Hartnell to take the part of the Doctor. Hartnell was known mostly for playing army sergeants and other tough characters in a variety of films, but Lambert had been impressed with his sensitive performance as a rugby league talent scout in the film version of &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, which inspired her to offer him the role.

Hartnell&#x27;s Doctor would initially be accompanied by his granddaughter Susan Foreman (played by Carole Ann Ford), originally to have been merely a travelling companion, but with a family tie added by Coburn, who was uncomfortable with the possible undertones the relationship could carry were they to be unrelated. They were joined in the first episode by two of Foreman&#x27;s schoolteachers, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell), from contemporary 20th-century England. This remained the line-up of the series for the entire first season, but over time the regular line-up would change regularly as the Doctor&#x27;s various companions left him to return home, having found new causes on worlds they had visited and elected to stay there, or even occasionally being killed off. However, he would always quickly find new travelling companions. Such characters were used by the production team to relate the point of view of the viewers at home, asking questions and furthering the stories by getting into trouble.

The first (pilot) episode of the series, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, had to be re-recorded owing to technical problems and errors made during the performance. During the days between the two tapings, changes were made to costuming, effects, performances, and the script (which had originally featured a more callous Doctor, and Susan doing unexplained things such as flicking ink on paper and folding it to produce a symmetrical pattern, and then tracing shapes over the pattern). This second version of &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, the first episode of the very first serial, was transmitted at 5.15 pm on 23 November 1963, but due to both a power failure in certain areas of the country and the overshadowing news of US President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, it drew minimal comment and was repeated the following week immediately before the second episode.

It was not until the second serial, &quot;The Daleks&quot;, that the programme caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation&#x27;s script by her direct superior Donald Wilson but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme better than he did.

Hartnell&#x27;s Doctor was not initially paternal or sympathetic; he described himself and Susan simply as &quot;wanderers in the 4th dimension&quot;. He was cantankerous, bossy and occasionally showed a streak of ruthlessness. However, the character mellowed as he grew closer to his companions, and he soon became a popular icon, especially among children who watched the series. This alteration in the portrayal of the Doctor began during the fourth serial, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. The Doctor&#x27;s role was minimal during episode two, &quot;The Singing Sands&quot;, and from the later episodes his portrayal of the character mellowed considerably.

The programme became a great success, frequently drawing audiences of 12 million or more, and the Daleks came back for several return appearances. Whitaker left the show early in the second season (though continued writing for it until 1970), being briefly replaced by Dennis Spooner, who in turn was replaced by Donald Tosh at the end of the season. Pinfield also left halfway through the season due to poor health but was not replaced.

By the time of the third season in 1965, however, some difficulties were beginning to arise. Lambert had moved on, to be replaced as producer by John Wiles, who did not have a good working relationship with Hartnell. The lead actor himself was finding it increasingly difficult to remember his lines as he was suffering from the early stages of the arteriosclerosis that would later cause his death. Wiles and Tosh came up with a way of writing Hartnell out in the story &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot;, by having the Doctor made invisible for part of the story, intending that when he re-appeared he would be played by a new actor. However, Wiles was forbidden to replace Hartnell by the new Head of Serials, Gerald Savory. Wiles had also hoped to make other bold changes, such as introducing a companion with a cockney accent (which was vetoed, as he was told all characters must speak &quot;BBC English&quot;), and resigned shortly afterwards (allegedly after learning that he would be sacked at the end of the season), with Tosh also resigning on principle.

By 1966, however, it was clear that Hartnell&#x27;s health was affecting his performances, and that he would not be able to carry on playing the Doctor for a long period of time. By this point, Savory had moved on as Head of Serials and his successor, Shaun Sutton, was more agreeable to change, allowing Wiles&#x27; replacement, Innes Lloyd, to make many of the very changes that Wiles had been barred from. Lloyd discussed the situation with Hartnell and the actor agreed that it would be best to leave, although later in life he would claim that he had not wanted to go.

===Second Doctor===

Lloyd and story editor Gerry Davis came up with an intriguing way of writing the First Doctor out – as he was an alien being, they decided that he would have the power to change his body when it became worn out or seriously injured, a process that was called &quot;renewal&quot; but would later become known within the mythology of the series as &quot;regeneration&quot;. Lloyd and Davis cast actor Patrick Troughton, who first appeared in November 1966 after the changeover from Hartnell had been seen at the end of the story &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;. That serial also introduced the popular Cybermen, villains who would return to face the Doctor on several subsequent occasions.

Troughton played the role generally in a more lightweight, comical manner, albeit still with much of the original character&#x27;s passionate hatred of evil and desire to help the oppressed. He also on occasion showed a darker side, manipulating his companions and the people around him for the greater good (examples include &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;). Davis left the show at the end of the fourth season and was replaced by Peter Bryant. A few months later, Lloyd left the show and Bryant was promoted to producer. Bryant&#x27;s successor as script editor was Derrick Sherwin (though Victor Pemberton had filled the job for Bryant&#x27;s first serial, &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;).

Troughton remained in the part for three seasons until 1969, eventually tiring of the workload of starring in a regular series. By this time, the viewing figures for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had fallen considerably, and new script editor Terrance Dicks recalled that there was some talk of ending the series after its sixth season in 1969 (though this has been denied by Bryant, Sherwin and director David Maloney, with paperwork suggesting it was actually in danger at the end of the &quot;seventh&quot; season in 1970). The series&#x27; budget was also increasingly strained by the cost of exotic sets, costumes and props every time the Doctor visited a new setting, and so Bryant and Sherwin (now effectively acting as co-producer, though the BBC refused to credit him as such) came up with the idea of reducing the cost of the series by setting all of the adventures on Earth, with the Doctor to act as the Scientific Advisor to an organisation called UNIT, the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, charged with defending the Earth from alien invasion.

This new set-up was tested in the season-six story &quot;The Invasion&quot;, and at the end of the season was put in place more permanently by having the Second Doctor captured by his own race, the Time Lords, and sentenced to exile on Earth with his appearance being changed again as punishment for his interference in the affairs of other races. Thus &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ended its sixth production block and its black and white era. From then on, in common with other British television programmes, it was produced in colour.

==1970s==
===Third Doctor===
Sherwin&#x27;s first choice to replace Troughton was actor Ron Moody, star of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;, but when he turned the part down, comic actor Jon Pertwee, another candidate from Sherwin&#x27;s shortlist, was cast instead. Sherwin had hoped that Pertwee would bring much of his comic acting skill to the part, but he was keen to establish himself as a serious dramatic actor as well as a comedian. Although some lighter touches were visible throughout Pertwee&#x27;s era, he essentially played it very &quot;straight&quot; and not at all as Sherwin had envisioned. Pertwee&#x27;s Doctor was more action-oriented than his predecessors, and the producers allowed Pertwee to indulge his love of riding various vehicles during his tenure, including motorcycles, hovercraft, the so-called &quot;Whomobile&quot; and the Doctor&#x27;s vintage roadster, &quot;Bessie&quot;.

Sherwin stayed only to oversee the first story of the seventh season. &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; was the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story to be made in colour and – due to industrial action in the electronic studios – the only example of the original series to be made entirely on film. Thereafter, he moved on to work on the series &quot;Paul Temple&quot;, and was replaced by director Barry Letts after another regular director on the show, Douglas Camfield, had turned down the job.

The seventh season, at twenty-five episodes, was shorter than any before and established a pattern of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; seasons being between twenty and twenty-eight 25-minute episodes in length, one that would last until the middle of the 1980s. However, although the new format of the Doctor being stuck on Earth had proved popular enough to save the programme from cancellation, neither Letts nor his script editor Terrance Dicks were particularly keen on the idea, and from the eighth season onwards sought reasons for the Doctor to be able to travel in time and space again, eventually having the Time Lords grant him full freedom after the 1973 tenth anniversary story, &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;, a serial which also featured guest appearances from Troughton and Hartnell, the latter in a restricted role due to his poor health.

Another innovation of theirs from the eighth season onwards was the introduction of the character of the Master as a new nemesis for the Doctor, conceived as a Professor Moriarty to the Doctor&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes. Played by Roger Delgado, he became a highly popular character, although over the following two seasons it was felt, by both the public and the production office, that he became a little overused. Delgado and the production team eventually agreed that he should be written out during the eleventh season by killing the character off, with some ambiguity as to whether or not he had died to save the Doctor.
However, before this story could be written, Delgado was killed in a car accident in Turkey. His death had a profound effect on Pertwee. With actress Katy Manning also having departed from her role as companion Jo Grant after three seasons, and Letts and Dicks both planning to move on, Pertwee felt that his &quot;family&quot; on the show was breaking up, and he also decided to leave after the eleventh season in 1974. Also, according to Elisabeth Sladen in an interview on the DVD release of &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs,&quot; Pertwee asked for a substantially increased fee for another year on the series. However, this request was rejected and he subsequently resigned from the role.

===Fourth Doctor===
Although Letts and Dicks were both planning on leaving at the end of the same season, it was they who worked closely on re-casting the role of the Doctor, in preparation to hand over to their successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, who had been a long-time writer for the programme.

Letts had intended to cast an older actor as the Fourth Doctor, to hark back to Hartnell&#x27;s portrayal in the 1960s, but after a long search he eventually selected Tom Baker, who was suggested to him by the incoming Head of Serials, Bill Slater. Baker was only forty years old, almost fifteen years Pertwee&#x27;s junior, but despite not being the type of actor Letts had originally been looking for, he went on to become arguably the most popular and best-remembered to play the role. He starred in the series for seven years, longer than any of his predecessors or successors, and during his time on the programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot; enjoyed a consistent run of popular success and high viewing figures. Baker&#x27;s Doctor was a more eccentric personality, at times passionate and caring, but at other times aloof and alien. This ambivalence was a deliberate choice by Baker, in an attempt to remind the viewers that the Doctor was not human, and therefore had non-human characteristics.

Under the control of Hinchcliffe and Holmes, who took over from the beginning of the twelfth season, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; became a much darker programme, with the pair being heavily influenced by Hammer Films&#x27; successful horror film productions and other gothic influences. Their era achieved the highest viewing figures (average ratings for Hinchcliffe&#x27;s 3 years were over 1 million higher than the average for any other producer) and is frequently praised by fans as a highly successful one, with many serials from that period remaining fan favourites. However, the BBC received complaints from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association, that the programme was unfit for children and could traumatise them. While the BBC publicly defended the programme, after three seasons Hinchcliffe was moved on to the adult police thriller series &quot;Target&quot; in 1977, and his replacement, Graham Williams, was specifically instructed to lighten the tone of the storylines.

After staying on during the fifteenth season under Williams for a brief handover period, Holmes also left the programme, and his replacement, Anthony Read, worked with Williams, who was told to create a less violent and more humour-based approach, much to Baker&#x27;s liking. The actor now felt very possessive of the part and frequently argued with directors over his inclusion of ad-libbed lines, but he was extremely pleased when the levity of the show increased even further after the departure of Read and the hiring of Douglas Adams as script editor for season seventeen in 1979. Some fans have criticised Adams for introducing too much of the sort of humorous content that served him well in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. However, others consider some of Adams&#x27; scripts to be among the series&#x27; high points, with &quot;City of Death&quot; (1979) being the primary example.

Season 17 saw the show garner its highest-ever viewing figures during the ITV network strike, with estimates of between 16 and 19 million viewers for episodes of the Williams and Adams penned story &quot;City of Death&quot;. However, there were also problems: director Alan Bromly left the production towards the end of the story &quot;Nightmare of Eden&quot; due to frustrations at the technicalities of production and arguments with Baker, leaving Williams to oversee completion of the story. Rampant inflation in the television industry was squeezing the series, with the budget much reduced in real terms from where it had been under Hinchcliffe. The scheduled final story of the season, Adams&#x27; own &quot;Shada&quot;, was abandoned midway through recording due to industrial action, and the season finished, after just twenty episodes, in January 1980.

Williams and Adams both departed at the end of the season, Williams because he had had enough of the programme after three seasons in charge, and Adams to concentrate on his increasingly successful &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; franchise. Williams recommended to the Head of Series &amp; Serials, Graeme MacDonald, that he be replaced by his Production Unit Manager, John Nathan-Turner. Although MacDonald agreed with the principle of appointing someone familiar with the workings of the show, he first offered the job to Nathan-Turner&#x27;s predecessor George Gallaccio, who after leaving &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1977 had already gained experience as a producer on the BBC Scotland drama &quot;The Omega Factor&quot;. However, Gallaccio turned the role down, and MacDonald offered it instead to Nathan-Turner, who accepted and became the new producer.

==1980s==

===John Nathan-Turner era===
As Nathan-Turner was a new producer and a restructure of the Drama Department meant that MacDonald would not be able to offer the direct support that had been available to previous producers, the latter appointed Barry Letts to return to the series as Executive Producer and oversee Nathan-Turner&#x27;s initial season working on the series. Letts had, in fact, been offering unofficial advice and comment to Graham Williams for some time beforehand.

Nathan-Turner and the new script editor, Christopher H. Bidmead, sought to return to a more serious tone for the series, reining in much of the humour that had been prevalent during Williams&#x27; tenure. The new producer also sought to bring the show &quot;into the 1980s&quot;, commissioning a new title sequence, bringing all the incidental music in-house to be produced electronically by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, and commissioning Peter Howell of the Workshop to come up with a brand-new arrangement of the series&#x27; famous theme tune. This displeased both Baker and his co-star Lalla Ward, who did not see eye-to-eye with Nathan-Turner on the new direction.

These changes arrived with season eighteen in the autumn of 1980, when the audience for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fell dramatically to around five million viewers, due chiefly to competition from the ITV network&#x27;s American import &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;. Tom Baker decided that after seven seasons in the part he would leave the role. His departure was heavily publicised in the press, with Baker attracting much comment for his tongue-in-cheek suggestion that his successor could be a woman, which the publicity-aware Nathan-Turner was not quick to deny.

===Fifth Doctor===
The producer initially sought actor Richard Griffiths to succeed Baker, but when he proved unavailable, cast Peter Davison, with whom he had previously worked on the popular drama series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;. Davison was very different from his four predecessors, being much younger, in line with Nathan-Turner&#x27;s desire for the Fifth Doctor to be completely unlike the popular Fourth, so that the public would not draw unfavourable comparisons between the two. Davison&#x27;s Doctor was arguably the most human of them all, and the one whose vulnerability was emphasised the most. The Fifth Doctor, more often than not, reacted to circumstances around him rather than being proactive, and had the air of a young aristocrat about him, in contrast to Baker&#x27;s bohemian personality.

Davison made his first appearance at the end of the season eighteen closer, &quot;Logopolis&quot;, although it was to be several months until his first full season in the part began in 1982. In the meantime Alan Hart, Controller of BBC 1, had decided to move the programme from autumn to a spring transmission slot. This was partly because, after eighteen years on Saturday evenings, he had also decided to change the transmission date, running the series twice-weekly on weekdays instead of once a week on Saturdays. This had the effect of halving the number of weeks the series was on-air to thirteen instead of twenty-six. Additionally, Davison was also working on the BBC sitcom &quot;Sink or Swim&quot; and was unavailable to record enough episodes to make an autumn start date viable.

This experiment in seeing the viability of running a twice-weekly drama serial would later lead to the launching of the massively popular soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in a similar slot. It also had the short-term effect of doubling the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audience, with the story &quot;Black Orchid&quot; being the final story of the regular run – and the only one of the 1980s – to break the double-figure millions barrier for the story overall, with a recorded figure of ten million viewers. The last individual episode with over ten million viewers was the first part of 1982&#x27;s &quot;Time-Flight&quot;.

During the production of the nineteenth season, Bidmead decided to move on and was replaced as script editor, first temporarily by Antony Root and then on a more permanent basis by Eric Saward, who remained in the role for several years. He and Nathan-Turner oversaw an increasing reliance on the show&#x27;s history in following seasons, with the return of various characters and adversaries from the Doctor&#x27;s past, culminating in 1983 with the twentieth-anniversary special 90-minute episode, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;.

Davison left the part after three seasons in 1984. He had been advised by Patrick Troughton to stay no longer than three years and was also disenchanted with the quality of the scripts on the programme during the twentieth season. Although he felt things had improved in the twenty-first, by then his departure had already been announced, and Nathan-Turner had selected Colin Baker – who had appeared playing another character in the season twenty story &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot; – to replace him. Colin Baker became the Sixth Doctor on screen in March 1984 after Davison&#x27;s final story, &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;.

===Sixth Doctor===
Colin Baker&#x27;s first full season in 1985 was reasonably successful. Alan Hart had decided to experiment with doubling the length of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes, with season twenty-two comprising thirteen 45-minute episodes rather than twenty-six 25-minute ones as had previously been the case. The series also returned to Saturday evenings, where it continued to draw reasonably respectable figures of seven to eight million viewers for most episodes even though it faced stiff opposition from another American import on ITV, &quot;The A-Team&quot;. Baker&#x27;s portrayal of the Doctor also met with criticism. A more bombastic and overbearing personality than any of the others, the Doctor&#x27;s use of deadly force against his enemies in a few stories caused controversy.

The series once again drew some criticism for the &quot;horrific&quot; content of some of the episodes. Unlike those misgivings levelled at the earlier reign of producer Philip Hinchcliffe, however, many of these came from within the BBC itself. Michael Grade had taken over as Controller of BBC 1 in 1984, and was not a fan of the series. In fact, he later admitted in interviews that he &quot;hated&quot; the programme, and he wanted to cancel it outright. There is much debate, however, as to how far his decisions were driven by his personal views. At the time, the BBC was suffering a financial shortfall due to expensive ventures such as the launch of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, breakfast and daytime television, and savings were needed across the corporation.

In any case, when it was announced that &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s production would be moved back a financial year, the news was interpreted as that the show was under threat of cancellation. The press and public outcry was much larger than Grade or the Board of Governors of the BBC had expected, being given a full-page front cover story in the popular tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;. A charity single, &quot;Doctor in Distress&quot;, was even produced and released in March 1985. It was written by Ian Levine and Fiachra Trench and performed by a group of 30 mid-level celebrities, including Nicola Bryant, Nicholas Courtney and Colin Baker himself, under the banner &quot;Who Cares&quot;. The single was universally panned.

Baker&#x27;s era was interrupted by what would be a long 18-month hiatus between seasons 22 and 23, compared to the then-usual gap of nine months between seasons. Before its postponement, plans for season 23 were well advanced, with scripts already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production workers.

Season twenty-three eventually aired in the autumn of 1986. Production of the new season was complicated by various factors. Although the episode length had reverted to 25 minutes, the number of episodes was reduced to fourteen, just over half the length of most previous seasons. The series was still up against &quot;The A-Team&quot; and, having been off the air for eighteen months, found it hard to regain viewers who had turned to ITV. Saward and Nathan-Turner had decided on an overarching storyline for the entire season entitled &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;, but its complexities proved confusing to both writers and viewers, with the season drawing viewing figures of only four to five million.

Problems existed behind the scenes as well. Robert Holmes, who had returned to writing for the series on a semi-regular basis in 1984, died before he could deliver the final episode. In addition, Saward and Nathan-Turner had a falling out, with Saward resigning from the programme, and Nathan-Turner unofficially taking on the role of script editor after Saward&#x27;s departure. Despite all of this, Grade consented to allow the series to continue, and moved it away from Saturday nights into a mid-week slot once more, and limited it again to a season of only fourteen 25-minute episodes. He also ordered that a new Doctor be found, as he was not enamoured of Colin Baker&#x27;s portrayal. Baker was therefore dismissed from the role, despite Nathan-Turner&#x27;s pleas to the BBC management that Baker did not fulfill his three-year contract, having effectively completed the equivalent of only one-and-a-half seasons.

===Seventh Doctor===

Nathan-Turner had thought that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other producer available or willing to take on the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he had little choice but to either accept this or resign from the corporation&#x27;s staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel&#x27;s influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he ever let on.

The new season was placed by Grade at 7.35 pm on Monday evenings opposite the ITV soap opera, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The latter was the most-watched programme on British television, and the viewing figures for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; suffered accordingly, though they were frequently the best for any BBC programme broadcast in the slot (viewing figures at the time did not take account of video recordings). The season&#x27;s quality was also publicly derided by many fans of the programme, although over the following two seasons the criticism was balanced out by some happier viewers, who felt that the young team of writers being assembled by Cartmel was taking the programme in the right direction.

Nathan-Turner attempted to leave once more at the end of production on the twenty-fifth season in 1988, but was once again persuaded to stay for a further year after another BBC producer – Paul Stone, who had produced &quot;The Box of Delights&quot; – was offered the position but declined. He and Cartmel remained on the production team for the twenty-sixth season in 1989. Although the season once again drew praise, the viewing figures were disastrous, starting at around the 3 million mark and improving to only around 4.5 million by the season&#x27;s conclusion. At the end of the year, Cartmel was head-hunted to script-edit the BBC&#x27;s popular medical drama, &quot;Casualty&quot;, and Nathan-Turner also finally left the show, although no replacements were assigned for either position as in-house production was being shut down.

Although Michael Grade had left the BBC in 1987 to take up a new position as Chief Executive of Channel 4, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; remained in its poor slot opposite &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in seasons of only fourteen 25-minute episodes, and continued to suffer in the ratings. Jonathan Powell, the new Controller of BBC 1, regarded Nathan-Turner with contempt, and the BBC&#x27;s new Head of Series, Peter Cregeen, decided to cancel the series, a decision which was clear to the production team by the end of production on the twenty-sixth season in August 1989.

The final story to be produced as part of the original run was &quot;Ghost Light&quot;, although it was not the last to be broadcast. That was &quot;Survival&quot;, the last episode of which was transmitted on 6 December 1989, and brought the series&#x27; twenty-six-year run to a close. John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode as it was possibly going to be the last ever. Accordingly, Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989 – by coincidence, the show&#x27;s twenty-sixth anniversary. This was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and his companion Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures.

==1990s==

===Planned Season 27===

At the time production of the original series was cancelled, work had already begun on Season 27. Both McCoy and incumbent companion Sophie Aldred (Ace) have stated that they would have left during this season. Storylines would have seen Ace joining the Time Lord academy on Gallifrey, and the introduction of a cat burglar as the new companion. Script editor Andrew Cartmel had already begun work on four loosely connected stories which would have comprised the season: &quot;Earth Aid&quot; by Ben Aaronovitch (a space opera featuring insect-like aliens), &quot;Ice Time&quot; by Marc Platt (set in 1960s London, featuring the return of the Ice Warriors and Ace&#x27;s departure), &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; by Cartmel (a contemporary story featuring animal testing), and &quot;Alixion&quot; by Robin Mukherjee (in which the Doctor is lured to an isolated asteroid to play a series of life-or-death games). Ahead of the new companion&#x27;s introduction, &quot;Ice Time&quot; would have featured her father, a criminal named Sam Tollinger, who was intended to be a recurring character. &quot;Alixion&quot; would have seen the Doctor going insane after facing a psychic enemy, with mental rather than physical strain being the cause of his regeneration at the end of the season. However, since the programme was placed on indefinite hiatus, none of these stories were fully developed. Actors Richard Griffiths and Ian Richardson
were two names mentioned by the production team as replacements for McCoy.

(The above details appear based primarily on a theoretical article written by Dave Owen for Doctor Who Magazine in issue 205, August 1997. In particular, the concept of regeneration through insanity was of Owen&#x27;s own invention and was never part of the plans of Andrew Cartmel or his team of writers, although Cartmel has since become aware of the idea and given it his approval as a potentially fitting end to the Seventh Doctor. None of the stories above were commissioned at the time of cancellation, even to the point of rough outlines, and were put together by Dave Owen from interviews with the most likely authors to have been commissioned had the series gone ahead.)

On 12 November 2009, Big Finish Productions announced an audio version of Season 27 with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred and Beth Chalmers as new companion named Raine Creevey (not Kate Tollinger as previously suggested). Marc Platt contributed &quot;Thin Ice&quot;, while script editor Andrew Cartmel has written &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot; and co-written &quot;Earth Aid&quot; with Ben Aaronovitch.

===Beyond television===

After the series was taken off the air in 1989, various &quot;Doctor Who&quot; projects were produced under license from the BBC. &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; continued its long-running comic strip and published original fiction, initially continuing the run of stories with the Seventh Doctor and Ace and featuring other companions and Doctors. Virgin Publishing published a series of original books, The New Adventures of Doctor Who (NAs), from 1991 to 1997. This series continued the stories of the Seventh Doctor, further exploring and developing the themes and ideas introduced in the later years of the television series. Several writers who had worked on that era wrote NAs, as well as writers of earlier eras and some writers who would work on the new series, including Russell T Davies, Paul Cornell, Mark Gatiss and Gareth Roberts. The NAs introduced original companions, including Bernice Summerfield, and at one point the series editors considered regenerating the Doctor; they did however regenerate The Master. The success of the NAs led Virgin to publish The Missing Adventures, featuring earlier Doctors and companions, and several short story anthologies.

Following the television movie (see below), the Eighth Doctor replaced the Seventh in both the comic strip and original books. BBC Books took back the rights to publish original fiction in 1997 and published two series, the Eighth Doctor Adventures and the Past Doctor Adventures as well as some anthologies of short stories, until 2005. Big Finish Productions adapted several NAs, minus the Doctor, into audio plays; on the back of these, they won a license from the BBC to produce original audio plays featuring the Doctors and their companions, and eventually also produced plays featuring other characters and monsters from the TV series and spin-offs; Big Finish has also published short story anthologies. Big Finish attracted a number of writers from the books series as well as new writers, including Rob Shearman; it also gave future Doctor David Tennant his first acting role in a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story.

For more information, see the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs article.

Although it was for all intents and purposes cancelled (series co-star Sophie Aldred said in the documentary &quot;More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS&quot; that she was told it was cancelled), the BBC maintained the series was merely &quot;on hiatus&quot; and insisted the show would return. Nathan-Turner would produce just one more &quot;Doctor Who&quot; project, the 30th anniversary spoof mini-episode &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, in 1993, a replacement for an aborted 30th-anniversary project called &quot;The Dark Dimension&quot;.

===Eighth Doctor===
Although in-house production had ceased, the BBC were hopeful of finding an independent production company to re-launch the show and had been approached for such a venture as early as July 1989 (while the 26th season was still in production) by Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures&#x27; television arm in the United States. Segal&#x27;s negotiations dragged on for several years and followed him from Columbia to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment company and finally to Universal Studios&#x27; television arm. At Amblin, Segal had come close to interesting the CBS network in commissioning the series as a mid-season replacement show in 1994, but this eventually came to nothing.

Finally, at Universal, Segal managed to interest the Fox Network in the programme, in the form of their vice-president in charge of Television Movie production, Trevor Walton, an Englishman who was already familiar with the series. Although Walton had no power to commission a series, he was able to commission a one-time television movie that served as a backdoor pilot for a possible series revival. The movie that was eventually made was simply titled &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. To distinguish it from the television series, Segal later suggested the alternate title &quot;Enemy Within&quot;. Opinions on how to refer to the television movie differ among fans, but the most common usage is to just call it the &quot;television movie&quot; or abbreviate it as &quot;the TVM&quot;.

The original plan was for a completely new American version of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in the same way that &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; was an unrelated re-make of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot; had re-made &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;. However, when new scriptwriter Matthew Jacobs came on board in 1995 – at Walton&#x27;s persuasion, feeling that a simpler story was needed than the intricate back-stories Segal had created with writer John Leekley – he persuaded Segal that the movie should instead be a direct continuation of the BBC series, something no American production had ever attempted before when buying the rights to a British programme.

Segal agreed, and Sylvester McCoy appeared briefly at the beginning of the film, before &quot;regenerating&quot; into the Eighth Doctor as played by Paul McGann. McGann had been Segal&#x27;s first choice for the part, although both the actor himself and the Fox Network had not initially been keen. Segal later claimed that the BBC&#x27;s Executive Producer on the project, Jo Wright, had wanted the role of the &quot;previous Doctor&quot; to be played by Tom Baker, as it was felt he was regarded as the definitive Doctor by the British public and McCoy&#x27;s tenure had not been as popular, but she backed down when Segal explained how this went against the continuity of the programme. Segal also had to fight to retain the familiar &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme: composer John Debney wanted to write a new piece, but was convinced to create a rearrangement of Ron Grainer&#x27;s composition, although Grainer did not receive screen credit for his work. A further tie to the BBC series was the use of the logo used from 1970 to 1973 during the Jon Pertwee era. This logo subsequently became the official franchise logo until it was replaced in 2004, although it would appear on all merchandise featuring any of the original series Doctors up until 2018.

Transmitted on the Fox Network on 14 May 1996 and on BBC One thirteen days later – although actually having debuted on CityTV in Toronto, Canada, the film having been shot in Vancouver, on 12 May – the production drew only 5.5 million viewers in the United States, although it was far more successful in the UK with 9 million viewers, one of the top-ten programmes of the week.

McGann&#x27;s Doctor was a combination of boyish glee and wonder at the universe with occasional flashes of an old soul in a young body, and was well received by fans, even if the reactions to the television movie were mixed. However, in spite of the success and popularity of the film in the UK, the disappointing US viewing figures led Fox to decline to commission a series. With no broadcast network attached in the United States, Universal could not produce a series for the BBC alone. Indeed, it would have been cheaper for the BBC to make a new series themselves rather than pay for a series with no production partner. Thus plans for a new series were scrapped, with no new production looking likely as the decade came to an end.

===Back to the BBC===
Following the 1996 television movie, Universal retained some rights to produce new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, but without a broadcaster attached, they allowed those rights to expire. Full production rights, therefore, reverted to the BBC in 1997.

Little happened at the BBC regarding new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production until the following year, when producer Mal Young arrived at the corporation&#x27;s in-house production arm as Head of Continuing Drama Series. Young was keen on reviving the programme, and this interest was shared by the then controller of BBC One, Peter Salmon. Tony Wood, a producer in Young&#x27;s department, who previously worked at Granada Television, recalled his former colleague Russell T Davies&#x27; enthusiasm for the programme and recommended him to Young as someone who might make a good writer of a new version. Davies had recently written for the Granada dramas &quot;The Grand&quot; and &quot;Touching Evil&quot; for the ITV network, and earlier in the decade had worked for the BBC, writing the well-received children&#x27;s science fiction serials &quot;Century Falls&quot; and &quot;Dark Season&quot;, which itself contained many &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-influenced themes.

A meeting was arranged between Davies and Mal Young&#x27;s development producer, Patrick Spence. In 1999 the media took hold of the story following the success and critical acclaim surrounding Davies&#x27; Channel 4 drama, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. Although various sources claimed that a provisional title of &quot;Doctor Who 2000&quot; had been given to the proposed new series, in reality very little work had been done, as Peter Salmon had been informed by BBC Worldwide that a new series would upset the tentative plans they were making for a new film version of the series. Thus, plans for the television revival were shelved for the time and seemed to become even less likely in 2000 when Salmon was replaced as controller of BBC One.

==2000s==

===40th Anniversary Doctor===

However, Salmon&#x27;s successor, Lorraine Heggessey, proved to be equally enthusiastic about the idea of new &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, often commenting to the press that she would like to pursue the idea but that &quot;rights difficulties&quot; prevented it. Similarly positive comments were made by the corporation&#x27;s overall Head of Drama, Jane Tranter. Heggessey had received several new series proposals since she had taken over control of BBC One, the highest-profile being from producer Dan Freedman – who had produced a full-cast, official, audio &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story, entitled &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;, for the BBCi website in 2001. Another came from actor and writer Mark Gatiss, who in 2002 drew up and submitted a proposal in collaboration with writer Gareth Roberts and then &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; editor Clayton Hickman.

In the meantime, BBCi, the interactive media arm of the corporation, who had scored successes with their &quot;Doctor Who&quot; webcasts (beginning with the aforementioned &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Real Time&quot; in 2002 and a re-make of the uncompleted &quot;Shada&quot; in 2003), decided on a more ambitious project to celebrate the programme&#x27;s upcoming 40th anniversary. In July 2003, BBC announced the production of &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;, a fully animated adventure adapted for webcasting with Richard E. Grant as the Doctor and Sir Derek Jacobi as the Master. As there were no concrete plans for producing a new series, BBC announced &quot;Shalka&quot; as the official continuation of the programme, and that Grant was the official Ninth Doctor. However, events were soon to overtake that.

===Ninth Doctor===
In September 2003, Heggessey managed to persuade Worldwide that as several years had now passed and they were no nearer to producing a film, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. The other proposals notwithstanding, Tranter and Heggessey elected to approach Davies once again, who had often told the BBC when approached for other projects that he would only return to them to take charge of a new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He quickly accepted, and on 26 September 2003 it was officially announced that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; would be returning to BBC One, produced in-house at BBC Wales in 2004 for transmission in 2005.

Davies was made the chief writer and executive producer of the new series (called Series 1 instead of continuing the numbering with Season 27, although the narrative thread continued from the old series rather than starting afresh), and other writers included Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat, Paul Cornell and Rob Shearman. The producer was Phil Collinson and the other executive producers were Mal Young (although he subsequently left the BBC midway through production at the end of 2004), and BBC Wales Head of Drama, Julie Gardner. A new arrangement of the theme tune was composed by Murray Gold. Gardner later commented that the choice of Cardiff as the base for filming the series was the result of a combination of factors. She and Davies, who had worked together on the BBC drama series &quot;Casanova&quot; starring David Tennant, were both from Wales; the BBC was looking to move more of its productions away from London, and there was a good variety of filming locations in the area.

The new series would comprise thirteen 45-minute-long episodes, with the first story titled &quot;Rose&quot; after the Doctor&#x27;s new companion Rose Tyler. Unlike past seasons which used serial-style storytelling, the new series would have mainly standalone or two-part episodes. Filming of the first season began in Cardiff on 18 July 2004. With the new series confirmed, when &quot;Shalka&quot; was webcast in November 2003, the further adventures of Grant&#x27;s Ninth Doctor were in doubt. In February 2004, plans for sequels to &quot;Shalka&quot; were indefinitely shelved, although Grant&#x27;s version of the character, now dubbed the &quot;Shalka Doctor&quot;, would return in a short story entitled &quot;The Feast of the Stone&quot; published on the BBC website.

After much speculation in the press about possible candidates, BBC announced that Christopher Eccleston would be the Ninth Doctor, accompanied by former pop singer Billie Piper as Rose. In the April 2004 issue of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, Davies announced that Eccleston&#x27;s Doctor would indeed be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Grant&#x27;s Ninth Doctor to non-official status.

In April 2004, Michael Grade returned to the BBC, this time as the Chairman of the Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he was quoted as being generally indifferent to the new series, he eventually wrote an e-mail to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity.

&quot;Rose&quot; finally saw transmission on 26 March at 7 pm on BBC One, the first regular episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for over 15 years. To complement the series, BBC Wales also produced &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, a 13-part documentary series with each episode broadcast on BBC Three immediately after the end of the weekly instalment on BBC One. &quot;Rose&quot; received average overnight ratings of 9.9 million viewers, peaking at 10.5 million. The final figure for the episode, including video recordings watched within a week of transmission, was 10.81 million, No. 3 for BBC One that week and No. 7 across all channels. The success of the launch saw the BBC&#x27;s Head of Drama Jane Tranter confirming on 30 March that the series would return both for a Christmas Special in December 2005 and a full second series in 2006.

The series was well received by both critics and the public. The 2005 TV Choice/TV Quick Award went to Eccleston for Best Actor, and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was nominated for Best Series. Eccleston, Piper, and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; were all winners in their categories at the UK&#x27;s National Television Awards, announced on 25 October 2005. The series did go on to win two BAFTA awards in May, including the Best Drama Series category.

Due to an initial lack of interest by networks in the United States, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; debuted on the Sci Fi Channel on 17 March 2006, one year after the Canadian and UK showings.

Although the new series clearly continues the storyline of the originalwith Eccleston identified in publicity materials as the Ninth Doctor, and the appearance of original series elements such as UNIT and Sarah Jane Smiththe BBC is officially treating the series as a new programme, calling the 2005 season &quot;Series 1&quot;. This has led to controversy between fans who wish to follow the BBC&#x27;s numbering and those who consider the 2005 series to be Season 27 (and so on).

Concurrent with the new series, BBC Books revamped its line of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; original fiction, retiring, for now, its Eighth Doctor and Past Doctor paperback line (the last such volume appearing in late 2005) and launching a new series of hardback novels featuring the Ninth and, later, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors (see New Series Adventures).

===Tenth Doctor===
Hours after the announcement of a second series, tabloid newspapers &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; reported that Eccleston had quit the series. Eccleston then apparently released a statement through the BBC, saying that he would be leaving the role at Christmas for fear of being typecast.

Fan reaction to the news ranged from disappointment to sadness to irritation to outright anger. Some did point out, however, that the series is uniquely suited to deal with cast changes. The number of angry postings on the popular &quot;Outpost Gallifrey&quot; fan forum was to force Shaun Lyon, the owner of the website, to close down the forum for two days to allow tempers to cool.

Speculation arose as to how long the production team had been aware of Eccleston&#x27;s decision. Eventually, it transpired that the departure had been planned and the scripts were written to accommodate Eccleston&#x27;s departure, but it was not meant to have been announced until after the first series had concluded. The BBC said that they had falsely attributed the statement to Eccleston, and released it in violation of an earlier agreement not to reveal his departure publicly. The statement had been made after journalists made queries to the press office.

On 16 April 2005, the BBC confirmed that David Tennant would be the Tenth Doctor. The regeneration from Eccleston to Tennant took place in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, the season finale. Tennant and Piper next starred in a 7-minute mini-episode for Children in Need. Tennant&#x27;s first full story as the Doctor was the 2005 Christmas special, &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;, and Piper joined him for the whole of Series 2.

At a BAFTA screening of &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, the finale of the 2005 series, on 15 June 2005, Jane Tranter announced that both a second seasonal episode (later titled &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;) and third series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had been commissioned. Piper left the programme at the end of Series 2, and a new companion, Martha Jones (played by Freema Agyeman), joined Tennant at the start of Series 3 on 31 March 2007.

Series 2 aired in the UK and US in 2006 and finished airing in Canada on 12 February 2007. The third series aired in the UK in the spring of 2007 and began airing in Canada and the US during the summer of that year. A 2007 Christmas Special &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; was broadcast on 25 December 2007 in the UK, featuring Kylie Minogue as a waitress named Astrid Peth.

The fourth series aired in the UK in 2008 featuring two companions; Donna Noble, who first appeared in &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; and Martha Jones, who returned to the series for five episodes of series four. Billie Piper also returned to the show to reprise her original role as Rose Tyler.

Following broadcast of the fourth series, the BBC announced that the show would not return as a weekly series in 2009, due to a number of factors. Instead, four specials would be broadcast in 2009, with a full series returning in 2010. It was later announced that when the full series returned in 2010, Tennant would no longer be the Doctor. Playing the role would be the 26-year-old actor Matt Smith.

The return of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has led to the BBC launching a number of spin-offs and related programmes. The first of these was the behind-the-scenes series &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; which began airing on BBC Three in conjunction with the 2005 series and returned for a new set of episodes in 2006; each episode focuses on elements of that week&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode and the series has continued alongside all stories since 2005. In 2006, the first full &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, debuted on BBC Three; it did not air in the United States until BBC America debuted it in September 2007, while the Canadian CBC aired it in October 2007. A second behind-the-scenes series, &quot;Totally Doctor Who&quot;, which aired on BBC One, also debuted in 2006. After the appearance of Sarah Jane Smith in the 2006 episode &quot;School Reunion&quot;, it was announced that Elisabeth Sladen would reprise the role in a new series entitled &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, the first episode of which aired on BBC One on 1 January 2007, followed by its debut as a weekly series in September 2007. Following Sladen&#x27;s death, the programme came to an end after its fifth series in autumn 2011. Yet another spin-off series, &quot;K-9&quot;, was announced for 2007, but this series was not being produced by the BBC. In addition, Tennant and Agyeman provided voice acting work for &quot;The Infinite Quest&quot;, an animated serial that aired as part of the 2007 series of &quot;Totally Doctor Who&quot;.

==2010s==
===Eleventh Doctor===

On 20 May 2008, it was announced that Russell T Davies would step down as executive producer and head writer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2009; Steven Moffat was confirmed as his replacement.

On 29 October 2008, during his acceptance speech via live feed at the National Television Awards, David Tennant publicly announced his intention to exit the series at the end of the 2009 specials, making way for a new actor to portray the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in the 2010 series. 26-year-old actor Matt Smith was announced as his successor in a special edition of &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, broadcast on BBC One on 3 January 2009. Production on Moffat and Smith&#x27;s first series began in July 2009, and the first episode was broadcast on 3 April 2010.

The new series was accompanied by a new logo, unveiled on 6 October 2009, and a new title sequence. The series featured a completely redesigned TARDIS interior, a slightly altered TARDIS exterior, and a new companion – Amy Pond – portrayed by Karen Gillan. Gillan was joined on a recurring basis by Arthur Darvill, playing Amy&#x27;s boyfriend (later husband) Rory Williams, and Alex Kingston as the mysterious River Song.

The Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s first series concluded on 26 June 2010 with the transmission of the series finale &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, followed by another Christmas Special, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and a pair of Comic Relief mini-episodes, &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Time,&quot; broadcast on 18 March 2011.

A second full series of 13 episodes was commissioned for 2011, with Smith and Gillan both returning as the Doctor and Amy respectively (making it the first time since the show&#x27;s relaunch in 2005 that both the Doctor and main companion had remained the same from one series to the next). The series was broadcast in two halves, with the first seven episodes broadcast between April and June 2011, and the final six beginning on 27 August 2011. With the new series, Darvill was upgraded to series regular and full-time companion as Rory, and Kingston continued to appear on a recurring basis as River Song.
Due partly to budget restrictions at the BBC, the expected 2012 series, Smith&#x27;s third, was split into 5 episodes transmitted from September 2012 and a further 8 transmitted from April 2013, with the now traditional Christmas special between these 2 groups of episodes. Gillan and Darvill departed from the show at the end of the first group of episodes; new companion Clara Oswald debuted in the 2012 Christmas special, played by Jenna Coleman.

The advent of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary in November 2013 meant that instead of starting to film an 8th series, the BBC started work on a feature-length special, to be transmitted on 23 November 2013, the precise date of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. As well as being made in 3D for presentation at selected cinemas, the episode was also announced to be co-starring David Tennant and Billie Piper, reprising their roles of the Tenth Doctor and Rose, though ultimately Billie Piper played The Moment, a Gallifreyan Weapon that took the form of Rose.

Smith stepped down as the Eleventh Doctor with his last episode being the 2013 Christmas special.

===Twelfth Doctor===
It was announced on 4 August 2013 on a live BBC special entitled &quot;Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor&quot; that Peter Capaldi would portray the twelfth incarnation of the Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. During his appearance in the special, he said that he had been a fan of the series; a letter that he had written to the Radio Times at the age of 15 about the show was read aloud. Capaldi had already appeared in the series 4 episode &quot;The Fires of Pompeii&quot; as Caecilius, the father of the family that the Doctor saves from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. He had also appeared in &quot;&quot; as the civil servant John Frobisher.

Series 8 was once again broadcast weekly in one continuous block, albeit with a reduced length of 12 episodes in total. Jenna Coleman remained as a main cast member in the role of Clara. The series premiere &quot;Deep Breath&quot; was first broadcast on 23 August 2014. The 2014 Christmas special &quot;Last Christmas&quot; was originally intended to be Clara&#x27;s exit from the show but was rewritten following Coleman&#x27;s decision to stay for an additional series.

Series 9 was again commissioned for 12 regular episodes, starring Capaldi as the Doctor and Coleman as Clara. The series premiered on 19 September 2015 with the episode &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. Most of the series consisted of two-part stories, with the exception of the ninth episode &quot;Sleep No More&quot; acting as a standalone story and the final three episodes forming a loose three-parter. Coleman departed from the show in the series finale &quot;Hell Bent&quot;, broadcast 5 December 2015. The 2015 Christmas special, &quot;The Husbands of River Song&quot;, saw Alex Kingston return for the character River Song&#x27;s final appearance.

On 22 January 2016, the BBC announced that Moffat would be stepping down as showrunner after series 10 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and would be replaced by Chris Chibnall as lead writer and executive producer. In addition, series 10 would debut in Spring 2017, with a Christmas special airing in 2016. On 30 January 2017, Peter Capaldi announced he would be stepping down as the Twelfth Doctor in the 2017 Christmas special.

Series 10 once again starred Peter Capaldi as the Doctor and introduced Pearl Mackie as a new companion Bill Potts. Matt Lucas as the recurring guest character Nardole was also promoted to series regular. The twelve-episode series premiered on 15 April 2017 with &quot;The Pilot&quot;. Cast members Capaldi, Mackie and Lucas, as well as showrunner Moffat and composer Murray Gold, all departed from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the 2017 Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, which also guest-starred David Bradley as the First Doctor.

==2020s==
===Thirteenth Doctor===
It was announced on 16 July 2017 that Jodie Whittaker would portray the Thirteenth Doctor in the eleventh series. She is the first woman to be cast in the role. The series introduced a new set of companions, including Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole, and Mandip Gill as Graham O&#x27;Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin &quot;Yaz&quot; Khan, respectively. A new logo was unveiled at the BBC Worldwide showcase on 20 February 2018. This logo was designed by the creative agency Little Hawk, who also created a stylised insignia of the word &quot;who&quot; enclosed in a circle with an intersecting line. A new opening title sequence was also introduced; however, it did not debut until the second episode of the series. Segun Akinola took over as the series composer, creating a new rendition of the theme music along with an assortment of original music cues.

Series 11 premiered on 7 October 2018 with &quot;The Woman Who Fell to Earth&quot;. The episode count was again reduced to ten regular episodes. In place of the traditional Christmas special that had aired annually over 2005–2017, a New Years special, &quot;Resolution&quot;, was broadcast on 1 January 2019.

No regular episodes were broadcast throughout 2019. Series 12 was commissioned for another ten-episode run in 2020, with all the main cast from the previous series returning. Rather than having a dedicated Christmas or New Years special, 1 January 2020 instead saw the broadcast of the series premiere &quot;Spyfall, Part 1&quot;; the series then took up its regular timeslot on 5 January with &quot;Spyfall, Part 2&quot;. The series concluded with &quot;The Timeless Children&quot;, which saw the Doctor learning of her true origins as an alien lifeform from another universe, rather than a Time Lord as she had always believed. The episode received 4.69 million views upon its airing, the lowest view count of any episode in the modern series. It was followed by the special &quot;Revolution of the Daleks&quot;, which was broadcast on New Years Day 2021, and was the second episode produced in 4K Ultra HD, alongside Twice Upon a Time.

On 29 July 2021, Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall announced that they would both step down as The Doctor and showrunner respectively, after the thirteenth series in 2021 and a trio of specials in 2022.

Series 13, also entitled Flux premiered on 31 October 2021 with &quot;The Halloween Apocalypse&quot;. This was the first time in the revived series, and the second overall time, that all the episodes in the series would be one story. The last time this happened was in &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;. The episode count for this series was reduced from the original eleven, to a six chapter series, with three additional specials that followed in 2022, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first special aired on 1 January 2022 entitled &quot;Eve of the Daleks&quot;, the second special aired on 17 April 2022 entitled &quot;Legend of the Sea Devils&quot; and the third special aired on 23 October 2022 entitled &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; as part of the BBC&#x27;s Centenary Celebrations, which was Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s final appearance as the Doctor.

===Fourteenth Doctor===
On 24 September 2021, the BBC announced that Russell T Davies would be returning as programmed showrunner for the 60th anniversary in 2023, and the series beyond. It was also announced that the show would be co-produced by BBC Studios and Bad Wolf, founded by production staff of Doctor Who. On 8 May 2022, Ncuti Gatwa was announced to play the Doctor. The following week it was announced that David Tennant and Catherine Tate would be returning to the show to reprise their role as The Doctor and Donna Noble in a series of three specials for the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

On 23 October 2022, Tennant made his return to the role at the end of &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. It was then announced that Tennant would be playing the Fourteenth Doctor, and Gatwa would be playing the Fifteenth Doctor.

On 25 October 2022, it was announced that the BBC agreed a partnership to stream the series on Disney+ outside of the UK and Ireland alongside introducing the new logo for the 60th anniversary specials and beyond.

The Show is produced and mastered in 4K HDR from the 60th anniversary Specials onwards.

On 10 October 2023, as part of the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who, the BBC announced that they have cleared the rights to allow more than 800 episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; programming — including episodes from the classic and revival series, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, &quot;Class&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; — as part of its iPlayer offering from 1 November 2023. Episodes included new accessibility options, including subtitles, audio description, and sign language. The release of these episodes excluded the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; (1963), due to a lack of agreement between the BBC and the son of the serial&#x27;s late writer Anthony Coburn.

On 30 October 2023, the BBC announced it would be using the term &quot;Whoniverse&quot; in an official capacity to describe all shows within the orbit of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and specifically their home on BBC iPlayer, including documentary programming.

&quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot; was released on 1 November on the BBC iPlayer as the first Whoniverse exclusive release. A Whoniverse ident was also introduced to unify content within the Whoniverse collection. This series sees the return of several Doctors and companions from the classic series as a celebration of the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

On 17 November 2023, a special five-minute minisode starring Tennant as the Fourteenth Doctor titled &quot;Destination: Skaro&quot; was broadcast during the 2023 &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon. It also featured the return of Julian Bleach as Davros.

On 24 November 2023, Tennant appeared in-character as the Fourteenth Doctor for the CBeebies Bedtime Story.

The 60th anniversary specials premiered on 25 November 2023 with &quot;The Star Beast&quot; directed by Rachel Talalay. It features the first full adventure of David Tennant as the Fourteenth Doctor, and the return of Catherine Tate as Donna Noble. They are also joined by returning cast members Jacqueline King, and Karl Collins, and new cast member Yasmin Finney. The second special &quot;Wild Blue Yonder&quot; features the return of, and the final acting performance of actor Bernard Cribbins as Wilfred Mott. This episode is dedicated to his memory. 
The specials conclude with &quot;The Giggle&quot;, which featured the return of The Toymaker from the 1966 story &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot;, this time played by Neil Patrick Harris. This episode also feature the return of Bonnie Langford as Mel Bush after her brief cameo at the end of &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. The episode also introduces the concept of the &quot;bi-generation&quot;, which sees the first appearance of the Fifteenth Doctor played by Ncuti Gatwa splitting from the Fourteenth Doctor, resulting in both incarnations existing at the same time. As a result, for the first time, this regeneration story and post-regeneration story is also a multi-Doctor story.

===Fifteenth Doctor===
On 8 May 2022, Ncuti Gatwa was announced to play the Doctor.

On 18 November 2022, during Children in Need, Millie Gibson was announced as the new companion Ruby Sunday.

Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson debut as the Fifteenth Doctor and companion Ruby Sunday in the 2023 Christmas Special &quot;The Church on Ruby Road&quot;. This marks the return of the annual Christmas specials.

It was confirmed that the new series starring Ncuti Gatwa will be called Season 1 instead of Series 14 as a result of a season numbering reset.

On 7 June 2023, Bonnie Langford was announced to be reprising her role as Mel Bush for the series.

On 23 October 2023, it was announced that filming for the second season has started, marking the first time the second season of a new Doctor has entered production even before the first episode of their predecessor had aired.

<text>Ronseal is a British wood stain, paint and preservative manufacturer, known for the phrase &quot;Does exactly what it says on the tin&quot;. The advertising slogan, which was created by agency HHCL, has since entered popular culture.

The company is based in Chapeltown, Sheffield, and has been owned by Sherwin-Williams since 1997.

==History==
In 1792, the Newton Chambers Group was founded. In 1896 Ronuk was founded in Portslade, Brighton. Ronuk was purchased by Izal Ltd in 1960, itself owned by the Newton Chambers Group in Sheffield. In 1956, Ronseal launched into the DIY market with Ronseal - Floor and Wood Seal. In 1964, the company moved to Chapeltown, Sheffield, where it still resides today.

Known as Roncraft, it became a separate sales division of Izal in 1970 and was bought three years later by the Sterling Drug Company.

In 1989, Sterling was bought by Eastman Kodak until the multinational photographic company sold all of its do it yourself business to the New York-based investment bank Forstmann Little &amp; Co. in 1994. Forstmann Little &amp; Co. included Ronseal within its Thompson Minwax Holding Corp. business, which it sold in 1997 to Sherwin-Williams.

Sherwin-Williams purchased the Polish woodcare company Altax in February 2009, and integrated it into the Ronseal unit.

<doc id="959756" wikidata="Q6418891" url="?curid=959756" title="Kiwi International Air Lines">
<text>Kiwi International Air Lines was a Part 121 American airline that operated from September 21, 1992 to March 24, 1999. It had its headquarters in the Hemisphere Center in Newark, New Jersey adjacent to Newark Liberty International Airport.

Kiwi International Air Lines was founded by a group of Eastern Air Lines pilots in a plan to re-employ former Eastern pilots, flight attendants, managers, and other contract and non-contract employees who had lost their jobs when Eastern Air Lines went into bankruptcy in 1989. The former airline pilots originally formed a group and called themselves Kiwis because they were no longer flying, just like the flightless Kiwi birds. In its brief history, the airline flew 8 million passengers without incident.

==History==

Originally, the intent of the Kiwi Founders (known as the Kiwi Acquisition Group) was to purchase the Pan Am Shuttle (which flew exclusively between New York LaGuardia, Boston Logan, and Washington National) out of the Pan Am bankruptcy. The group presented a Kelso and Company-backed $100 million offer to Pan Am for the Shuttle. Its offer was rejected in favor of Delta Air Lines offer for Pan Am including its shuttle operation. With advice from the United States Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Kiwi Acquisition Group decided to start a new airline from scratch rather than buy a failing carrier. To do this, the Kiwi Acquisition Group raised approximately $2 million from a group of 40 out-of-work, primarily Newark-based Eastern Air Lines pilots. Each pilot invested $50,000 with a promise of employment as a captain in any new airline the Kiwi Acquisition Group was able to certify - preferably based out of Newark International Airport. When it came time to name the new airline, the Kiwi Acquisition Group decided to keep Kiwi in the name of their new airline.

Kiwi flew its first revenue flights on September 21, 1992, using two refurbished Boeing 727-200s from Lufthansa on routes between Newark and Atlanta, Chicago and Orlando. Kiwi offered gourmet meals and expanded legroom with a 36-inch pitch in their airplanes. At start-up, ownership of KIWI was divided among Kiwi&#x27;s founders and certain of its employees. According to the DOT (Docket #48056 July 1992) at Start-Up, Founders and brothers Dr. Codie Bell and David Bell owned approximately 47% of the airline&#x27;s stock. The remainder of Kiwi&#x27;s stock was spread among a number of other individuals.

In his 2005 book &quot;Competition Demystified: A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy&quot; Columbia Professor Bruce Greenwald described Kiwi&#x27;s initial winning operating strategy as:

# Not to get so big as to directly antagonize established carriers. Kiwi started with 3 routes from Newark International Airport to 3 different hubs with different incumbent competitors. The amount of traffic Kiwi planned was unthreatening enough that it would cost the airline&#x27;s incumbents more to eliminate Kiwi than to let it survive. Kiwi&#x27;s east-west Newark-to-Chicago route (Kiwi flew into Midway Airport in Chicago and did not challenge United at its O’Hare hub) incurred minimally into United&#x27;s and also American&#x27;s business out of O&#x27;Hare. Kiwi&#x27;s Newark to Atlanta route (into Hartsfield) again put minimal pressure on Delta. Kiwi&#x27;s north–south routes to Florida from Newark were also designed to cherry pick a small portion of the leisure business from Delta and Continental.
# Avoid challenging the established carriers on price. Kiwi pegged its ticket prices to the lowest restricted fare the competition was already offering. Where it challenged its competitor was by providing somewhat enhanced service.
# Avoid poaching pilots, flight attendants, or other personnel from established carriers. A large part of its reason for being was to put Eastern employees back to work in an industry they loved and in a company they believed in. So Kiwi did not encroach on its competitors&#x27; employee bases.

The early Kiwi niche strategy was to focus its business on a single main hub (Newark – with access to the large NY-NJ metropolitan flying public), a simple route structure, an identifiable target business and large leisure markets. Being in the NY-NJ media capital of the world gave cash-poor Kiwi a distinct benefit – tremendous amounts of free national and local TV and radio coverage in its target markets which the airline made good use of.

Early on the airline secured a passenger sharing agreement from Richard Branson to feed between Kiwi and Virgin Atlantic flights. Branson helped out by promoting Kiwi and calling it his &quot;favorite&quot; U.S. airline. Kiwi did its share and enjoyed a flawless safety record and a near perfect dispatch reliability rate of 99.6%, as it expanded.

In 1993, Chairman Iverson committed Kiwi to placing an order for 11 BAC One-Eleven aircraft with five options. This involved selling a 14 percent stake in KIWI to a Romanian company (Romaero S. A.). Kiwi, which had only five 727-200 long haul jets at the time, reported that the BAC One-Eleven planes would be made by Romaero S.A. under a license from British Aerospace P.L.C. Kiwi committed to spending $20 million for each aircraft, which were primarily a short-haul jet. Under Chairman Iverson, Kiwi ordered 6 jets with 90 seats which were to be equipped with modern Rolls-Royce Tay engines. Kiwi had options to buy another five jets. The British-designed aircraft were to be built in Romania. However, Romaero failed to find any funding to develop and manufacture the aircraft. Kiwi ultimately scrapped the ill-conceived plan, but not before Romaero had invested approximately $1 million in Kiwi and received one seat on the Kiwi Board of Directors.

During 1994, Kiwi&#x27;s employee investors organized against Kiwi&#x27;s Chairman/CEO/President Robert Iverson&#x27;s mismanagement of the air line. Iverson&#x27;s employee owners (especially the majority shareholding pilots) were very concerned about the December FAA grounding of the entire KIWI fleet over pilot training irregularities which reportedly cost the air line over $2 million in losses. Iverson later instituted a drastic pay reduction for all employees in January 1995. By February 1995, the Kiwi Board of Directors (which was controlled by a Voting Trust of Kiwi&#x27;s employee shareholders) had learned of Kiwi&#x27;s precarious financial condition and forced removal of Iverson. &quot;Inc. Magazine&quot; reported that Kiwi under Iverson&#x27;s management accumulated operating losses of nearly $40 million in less than two and a half years of flying. This turned his employee investors (who had invested their life savings in the airline) and his own outside KIWI Board of Directors against him.

Iverson, for his part blamed his own employees and shareholders for the failure of the airline. &quot;One of the stupidest things I ever did was call everybody owners,&quot; Iverson told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in an interview. According to &quot;Inc&quot;., Iverson alleged Kiwi&#x27;s employee shareholders (who owned a controlling interest in the airline) were &quot;insubordinate and meddling&quot;, &quot;decision making was belabored&quot;, &quot;financial discipline impossible&quot;, and &quot;(his) efforts were subverted&quot;. Former KIWI Chairman John Anderson told &quot;Inc.&quot;, &quot;We didn&#x27;t have a leader in Bob Iverson.&quot;

&quot;Inc.&quot; reporter Anne Murphy wrote that Iverson could easily be criticized for poor business judgment. Iverson selected many of Kiwi&#x27;s top management from cronies of his who were fellow pilot investors who had no practical management experience. Iverson himself had previously been an Eastern Air Lines pilot. &quot;Inc.&quot; reported at the time: &quot;The CEO (Iverson) himself had never managed so much as a baggage carousel&quot;. As a result of his lack of business experience, Iverson expanded his management team to an unwieldy 11 vice-presidents. They were hand-picked by Iverson his fellow pilot investors. All reported directly to him. Iverson candidly admitted later, when interviewed for the &quot;Inc.&quot; article &quot;Taking the Fall&quot;, &quot;(I) ran the company like a little pilots&#x27; union or a flying club, not like a business.&quot; Bruce Greenwald in &quot;Competition Demystified&quot; concluded that Iverson&#x27;s &quot;quest for growth at all costs led it (Kiwi) to abandon a strategy that seemed to be working...&quot;.

After being fired by Kiwi, Iverson subsequently started another air carrier which focused on charter flying operations, rather than scheduled service like Kiwi had. According to the DOT/Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Air Carrier Financials: Schedule P-1.1&#x27;s filed by Sky Trek, this new venture promptly lost nearly $8 million in less than 2 years. At this point, Iverson was forced out of Sky Trek which filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter.

After his removal from Kiwi, the Kiwi Board of Directors was reconstituted and attempted to hire more professional (non-pilot) management. Jerry Murphy (formerly of MGM Grand Air and Pan Am) was eventually hired as the President and CEO of Kiwi in June 1995. Murphy served in that capacity until November 1998. At the time Murphy was brought on board, former Kiwi Chairman John Anderson explained: &quot;He (Iverson) never showed himself capable of running this airline profitably.&quot;. According to the &quot;Inc.&quot; reporter Anne Murphy, another insider told her, &quot;He (Iverson) had a tendency to throw gasoline on fires,&quot; The new CEO Jerry Murphy lamented to the press that Iverson created &quot;make-work&quot; positions that overstaffed the airline which raised its costs per seat mile which made profitability impossible.

Later in 1996 under Murphy&#x27;s reorganization, Kiwi appeared to get a lifeline when it announced it had secured a $20 million financing package from Recovery Equity Partners, a California based private equity fund through the efforts of Conexus. However, at the time Kiwi received the first tranche of the financing package, the ValuJet and Trans World Airlines accidents in May and July 1996 occurred. Following these unrelated accidents, the FAA increased its surveillance of the airline industry. But, more specifically, the FAA targeted the smaller carriers in the industry, like Kiwi. Because of alleged maintenance documentation issues found during this period by the FAA, Kiwi was directed by the FAA to temporarily ground 25% of its fleet.

Subsequently, Kiwi, which was once called &quot;one of the best of the recent start-up lines&quot; by &quot;Consumer Reports Travel Letter&quot;, filed for bankruptcy on September 30, 1996, and after failing to find additional financing, stopped scheduled service on October 15, 1996. After several fits and starts, in July 1997, a Federal bankruptcy judge in Newark agreed to liquidate Kiwi in a $16.5 million deal for Kiwi&#x27;s assets with Joe Logan (Aviation Holdings) and Dr. Charles C. Edwards (an orthopedic surgeon and entrepreneur from Maryland) who had led 30=plus business enterprises over his 33-year career. The deal included a Huntington Station, New York investment firm called &quot;NJS Acquisitions&quot;, which invested $3.5 million for its 20% stake. In its first five months under Edwards&#x27; hands-on leadership, Kiwi ended service from Atlanta to Palm Beach and Orlando, and added service from Newark to Boston and Tampa, from Boston to West Palm Beach, from Chicago to Tampa, from Atlanta to Tampa, and (on a seasonal basis) from Orlando to San Juan, Puerto Rico.

By the end of 1998, the &quot;new&quot; Kiwi had an operating loss of $19.8 million. By February 19, 1999, Kiwi owed more than $750,000 to the airports it served. Subsequently, on March 23, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced plans to revoke Kiwi&#x27;s operating certificate for failing to meet federal fitness standards for air carriers. Kiwi was also the subject of two separate USDOT investigations - one concerning the airline&#x27;s financial and managerial fitness and another concerning its safety. At the time, Kiwi was on the verge of receiving a $3 million bailout from the reconstituted Pan Am (to address the USDOT concerns about its financial and managerial situation). But the termination of Kiwi&#x27;s operating certificate for safety reasons meant it would be months before the airline could fly again if ever.

In March 1999, Kiwi tried becoming a simple charter carrier with four leased jets flying to six cities, 500 employees and 11 months of paid advance reservations for about 80,000 seats. However, by December 1999, the Federal bankruptcy judge in Newark approved the total liquidation of the airline.

Ed Perkins, editor of &quot;TheTravel Letter&quot;, noted that other members of the travel press blamed the Kiwi bankruptcy on chronic undercapitalization, problems with the FAA, and the &quot;media&#x27;s indiscriminate innuendos about the safety of all low-fare airlines following the Valujet crash&quot;. Perkins suggested a fourth problem for Kiwi: the &quot;pervasive power of the giant lines&#x27; frequent-flyer programs,&quot; noting that Kiwi had deliberately targeted business travelers on some of its routes. Perkins pointed out that Kiwi&#x27;s major competitors&#x27; approach was to match Kiwi&#x27;s fares. But, Kiwi&#x27;s competitors matched prices only around the times of the more limited Kiwi flight schedules. Basically, Kiwi&#x27;s competitors bracketed the Kiwi flights with similar competitive pricing; for the rest of their schedules, Kiwi&#x27;s major airline competitors returned their prices to levels they could make a profit at. And, more importantly, in its business markets, the major carriers were able to compete with Kiwi by using their frequent-flyer miles (worth about $12–15 per one-way trip) as loss leaders. This resulted in a loss of customers for Kiwi, particularly its business customers, even though it belatedly established its own Frequent Flyer program.

== Destinations ==


According to its spring/summer 1998 route map, the airline also served Niagara Falls, New York via the Niagara Falls International Airport. This same route map depicts nonstop routes flown the Kiwi hub located at Newark Liberty International Airport to Aguadilla, Atlanta, Chicago Midway, Orlando and West Palm Beach.

<text>Larix laricina, commonly known as the tamarack, hackmatack, eastern larch, black larch, red larch, or American larch, is a species of larch native to Canada, from eastern Yukon and Inuvik, Northwest Territories east to Newfoundland, and also south into the upper northeastern United States from Minnesota to Cranesville Swamp, West Virginia; there is also an isolated population in central Alaska.

== Description ==
&quot;Larix laricina&quot; is a small to medium-size boreal deciduous conifer tree reaching tall, with a trunk up to diameter. The bark of mature trees is reddish, the young trees are gray with smooth bark. The leaves are needle-like, long, light blue-green, turning bright yellow before they fall in the autumn, leaving the shoots bare until the next spring. The needles are produced in clusters on long woody spur shoots. The cones are the smallest of any larch, only long, with 12-25 seed scales; they are bright red, turning brown and opening to release the seeds when mature, 4 to 6 months after pollination.

Key characteristics:

* The needles are normally borne on a short shoot in groups of 10–20 needles.
* The larch is deciduous and the needles turn yellow in autumn.
* The seed cones are small, less than long, with lustrous brown scales.
* Larch are commonly found in swamps, fens, bogs, and other low-land areas.

== Distribution and ecology ==
Tamaracks are very cold tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to at least , and commonly occurs at the Arctic tree line at the edge of the tundra. Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in swamps, bogs, or muskegs, in wet to moist organic soils such as sphagnum, peat, and woody peat. They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on calcareous soils, it is not abundant on the limestone areas of eastern Ontario.
Tamarack is generally the first forest tree to grow on filled-lake bogs. In the lake states, tamarack may appear first in the sedge mat, sphagnum moss, or not until the bog shrub stage. Farther north, it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage. Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns, so it is one of the common pioneers on sites in the boreal forest immediately after a fire.

The central Alaskan population, separated from the eastern Yukon populations by a gap of about , is treated as a distinct variety &quot;Larix laricina&quot; var. &quot;alaskensis&quot; by some botanists, though others argue that it is not sufficiently distinct to be distinguished.

=== Damaging agents ===
Tamaracks are easily susceptible to fires, as they have shallow roots and thin bark. The tamarack&#x27;s shallow root system also leaves it susceptible to being knocked over by high-speed winds. It has also been discovered that abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands. Flooding, mainly caused by beaver dams and newly constructed roads, can kill off stands and damage adventitious roots.

Tamaracks are targeted by many species of insects. One of the most prominent damaging insects is larch sawfly, which is non-native. It causes damage across its range and causes defoliation which can kill the trees within 6 to 9 years. To lessen the problem, parasites have been imported to kill the larch sawflies in parts of Minnesota and Manitoba. Another serious defoliator is the larch casebearer (&quot;Coleophora laricella)&quot;. All tamaracks are susceptible to being killed by the larch casebearer, however recently the outbreaks of larch casebearer have been less severe.

There are some other insects that can harm Tamaracks, including spruce budworm (&quot;Choristoneura fumiferana&quot;); the larch-bud moth (&quot;Zeiraphera improbana&quot;); the spruce spider mite (&quot;Oligonychus ununguis&quot;); the larch-shoot moth &quot;(Argyresthia laricella&quot;); and the eastern larch beetle (&quot;Dendroctonus simplex&quot;). Healthy trees are left mostly unaffected by eastern larch beetles. Defoliation by the larch casebearer makes infestation of the eastern larch beetle more likely.

Only one of the many pathogens that affect Tamarack causing diseases serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture, is the &quot;Lachnellula willkommii&quot; fungus. It is a relatively new pathogen in Canada, first recorded in 1980 and originating in Europe. The fungus causes the formation of large cankers and a disease known as larch canker which is particularly harmful to the tamarack larch, killing both young and mature trees. Rust is the only common foliage disease amongst Tamaracks, and causes minimal damage to the trees. The needle-cast fungus &quot;(Hypodermella laricis)&quot; is also a cause for concern in Tamaracks.

=== Associated forest cover ===
Tamarack forms extensive pure stands in the boreal region of Canada and in northern Minnesota. In the rest of its United States range and in the Maritime Provinces, tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands.

Black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;) is usually tamarack&#x27;s main associate in mixed stands on all sites. Other commonly associated overgrowth species include balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;), white spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;), and quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) in the boreal region. In the better organic soil sites in the northern forest region, the most common associates are the northern white-cedar (&quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot;), balsam fir, black ash (&quot;Fraxinus nigra&quot;), and red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;). In Alaska, quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together. Additional common associates are American elm (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;), balsam poplar (&quot;Populus balsamifera&quot;), jack pine (&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;), paper birch (&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;), Kenai birch (&quot;B. papyrifera&quot; var. &quot;kenaica&quot;), and yellow birch (&quot;B. alleghaniensis&quot;).

There are a vast number of shrubs associated with Tamarack due to their range, some of the common ones are dwarf and swamp birch (&quot;Betula glandulosa&quot; and &quot;Betula pumila&quot;), willows (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), speckled alder (&quot;Alnus rugosa&quot;), and red-osier dogwood (&quot;Cornus stolonifera&quot;) bog Labrador tea (&quot;Ledum groenlandicum&quot;), bog-rosemary (&quot;Andromeda glaucophylla&quot;), leather leaf (&quot;Chamaedaphne calyculata&quot;), blueberries and huckleberries (&quot;Vaccinium spp.)&quot; and small cranberry (&quot;Vaccinium oxycoccos&quot;). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes sedges &quot;(Carex&quot; spp.), cottongrass &quot;(Eriophorum&quot; spp.), three-leaved false Solomonseal (&quot;Maianthemum trifolium&quot;), marsh cinquefoil (&quot;Potentilla palustris&quot;), marsh-marigold (&quot;Caltha palustris&quot;), and bogbean (&quot;Menyanthes trifoliata&quot;).

== Uses ==

The wood is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and was used by the Algonquian people for making snowshoes and other products where toughness was required. The natural crooks located in the stumps and roots are also preferred for creating knees in wooden boats. Currently, the wood is used principally for pulpwood, but also for posts, poles, rough lumber, and fuelwood; it is not a major commercial timber species. Tamarack wood is also used as kickboards in horse stables. Older log homes built in the 19th century sometimes incorporated tamarack along with other species like red or white oak. The hewn logs have a coarse grainy surface texture.

It is also grown as an ornamental tree in gardens in cold regions. Several dwarf cultivars have been created that are available commercially. Tamarack is commonly used for bonsai.

Tamarack poles were used in corduroy roads because of their resistance to rot. Tamarack posts were used before 1917 in Alberta to mark the northeast corner of sections surveyed within townships. They were used by the surveyors because at that time the very rot-resistant wood was readily available in the bush and was light to carry. Their rot resistance was also why they were often used in early water distribution systems.

The aboriginal peoples of Canada&#x27;s northwest regions used the inner bark as a poultice to treat cuts, infected wounds, frostbite, boils and hemorrhoids. The outer bark and roots are also said to have been used with another plant as a treatment for arthritis, cold and general aches and pains.

Wildlife use the tree for food and nesting. Porcupines eat the inner bark, snowshoe hares feeds on tamarack seedlings, and red squirrels eat the seeds. Birds that frequent tamaracks during the summer include the white-throated sparrow, song sparrow, veery, common yellowthroat, and Nashville warbler.

== Reaction to competition ==

Tamarack is very intolerant of shade. Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years, it must become dominant to survive. When mixed with other species, it must be in the over story. The tree is a good self-pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length.

Because tamarack is very shade-intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor bog sites, whereas northern white-cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good swamp sites. Recurring sawfly outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably sped the usual succession to black spruce or other associates.

Various tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment.

The shade-intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management. Some adaptation of clear cutting or seed-tree cutting is generally considered the best silvicultural system because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open, and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually wind-firm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and herbicide spraying.

== Names ==

The names &quot;tamarack&quot; and &quot;hackmatack&quot; appear to derive from Algonquian but have undergone contamination with the word &quot;tacamahac&quot;, from Nahuatl, so the precise words that underlie them are unclear. The word &quot;akemantak&quot; meaning &quot;wood used for snowshoes&quot; has been cited as a name for the species, but the Proto-Algonquian &quot;*a·kema·xkwa&quot; this appears to represent was the name for the white ash.

<doc id="959763" wikidata="Q3071471" url="?curid=959763" title="Fido (wireless carrier)">
<text>Fido Solutions Inc. is a Canadian mobile network operator owned by Rogers Communications. Since its acquisition by Rogers in 2004, it has operated as a Mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) using the Rogers Wireless network.

Fido pioneered the concept of providing unlimited service in select Canadian cities. Fido was the first carrier in Canada to launch a GSM-based network and the first wireless service provider in North America to offer General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) on its network.

==History==
Fiso Solutions was founded in 1996 by Microcell Telecommunications. Fido was the first provider in Canada to offer a network with the GSM standard. The original development of Fido was funded in part by Voicestream, now T-Mobile US.

=== Logo ===
Fido&#x27;s logo is a yellow doghouse. The name, &quot;Fido,&quot; was suggested to Microcell Telecommunications, the first importer of GSM technology from Europe to Canada, on the recommendation of its marketing-communications agency at the time, BOS (Beauchesne, Ostiguy, Simard) of Montreal (now DentsuBos). The agency had been searching for a name that would appeal to both French- and English-speaking consumers.
The brand name &quot;Fido&quot; inevitably led to the use of dogs in its commercials, which became the brand&#x27;s informal trademark in TV advertising, starting in 1995. During the 2000s it ran ads where the narrator finished by catching a jumping dog and saying &quot;regrettably, only from Fido&quot;. As of 2017, the tagline is &quot;Go get it.&quot;

===Acquisition by Rogers===
In November 2004, Microcell was acquired by the other competing GSM carrier, Rogers Communications, for an estimated . At the time of acquisition, Fido had 1,275,094 customers. The company&#x27;s name was changed to Fido Solutions shortly thereafter. Fido has retained its data roaming service with T-Mobile. Shortly thereafter, Rogers Communications also bought Sprint Canada, a telecom services reseller that was an MVNO partner with Microcell. As of May 2013, Fido had a customer base of 3,372,763 customers, making it Canada&#x27;s fourth-largest wireless carrier.

Within Rogers Communications, Fido has been re-positioned as a mid-range brand, with Rogers Wireless as the full-service brand having the widest coverage and longest service hours, and Chatr as the entry-level offering that offers mostly prepaid plans and has the smallest coverage. Although there is some overlap between Fido and Rogers Wireless, Fido tends to offer a greater selection of Bring your own device plans, while offering less subsidies for devices on contracts, and having a delayed launch of the latest phones. Fido&#x27;s subscriber base appeals largely to millennials, whereas Rogers Wireless caters to traditional clients including corporate customers. Fido&#x27;s direct competitors are the flanker brands Virgin Mobile Canada and Koodo Mobile, which complement full-service providers Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility

=== 2022 outage ===

In July 2022, during the Rogers Communications outage, many Fido customers experienced issues with mobile services. The issue was eventually resolved on July 8 and compensation was promised to customers.

==Network==

Fido now operates as an MVNO of Rogers. Fido customers will see &quot;Fido&quot; as the network name, and Rogers customers will see &quot;ROGERS&quot; as the network name.

Since its inception, the Fido network ran on GSM. This GSM compatibility continues to exist today. The current result is the integration of the Fido network into the Rogers Wireless network after the acquisition by Rogers. Fido is phasing out older technologies (1900 MHz) on their 2G and 3G networks; despite this matter, Fido network continues to support 2G devices on 850 MHz band only. 

==Services==
Since the company&#x27;s inception, Fido offered unique services to differentiate itself from its competitors. Notably, its CityFido plans include either multiple or unlimited local calling minutes in certain zones throughout Canada. Fido was also the country&#x27;s first and last mobile service provider to bill postpaid airtime by the second, while other companies round up calls to the next minute except for some grandfathered customers. The FidoDOLLARS program offers a selection of rewards to loyal customers. (FidoDOLLARS are equal to 4 percent of a customer&#x27;s invoice before service charges (NSF, re-activation fee, administrative fees and taxes). As of April 2016, Fido phased out the FidoDOLLARS program. Fido also offers several plans and add-ons for mobile Internet access.
===Voice plans===
On November 4, 2008, Fido announced a re-branding and subsequent relaunch of their services due to competition from Koodo Mobile. This re-positioned the company as a discount wireless brand, offering postpaid plans virtually identical to those of Koodo with no system access fee or carrier-charged &quot;911 fee&quot;. Clients using legacy plans, however, may keep them only if they continue to pay both fees. Current plans include 100, 200, 300, 500 or unlimited minutes incoming and outgoing calls (Canada-wide calls). The $50 unlimited plan replaces the previously available CityFido plans.

All current plans include the Caller ID, a basic voicemail service (mini voicemail), call waiting and conference call features, plus unlimited outgoing and incoming text (SMS) and picture/video (MMS) from the Fido network to standard numbers worldwide, at no extra cost. The Rogers-pioneered WhoCalled feature is available for an additional monthly fee with the &quot;Value Pack&quot; add on. &quot;Circle Calling&quot; is also included, which allows &quot;free calls between people on the same account&quot;, with a maximum beds of five people per account. They also offer a minute tracker, similar to the one used by Virgin Mobile Canada, to remind customers when they have used 75% and 100% of their monthly minutes.

The CityFido Prepaid plan is now called the &quot;in zone plan&quot;. It includes unlimited local calling while in the city of activation, plus unlimited text messages sent to standard Canadian numbers. The plan is now only available in Gatineau, London, Ontario, Ottawa and Toronto. It was previously offered in Quebec City, Montreal, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Victoria. Customers in these cities must now pay a $10 monthly surcharge to obtain a nearly identical &quot;with no zone restrictions plan&quot;. Fido discontinued the CityFido plan for new postpaid customers.

Fido Wireless Home Phone service was launched in mid-2013. Designed as an alternative to landline telephony, the service uses a ZTE access point to provide a connection between wired phones and Fido&#x27;s network. The monthly plan features unlimited calling to and from Canada, Caller ID and voicemail. It costs on its own, but Fido postpaid customers pay instead. In the midwestern provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and in Quebec, the Wireless Home Phone is offered at a discounted rate of .

Starting in 2018, Canadian wireless carriers, including Fido, changed the way they offer plans and devices, by separating the cost of each aspect. Previously, plan and device costs were bundled together as one price. This reduced transparency for consumers and made it difficult to understand. However, this new idea of &quot;device financing&quot; is currently being reviewed by the CRTC.

December 5, 2018, Fido confirmed customers are able to purchase wireless plans with eSIM. Customers with the eSIM enabled smartphones and devices can purchase the eSIM voucher online and connect to the network. 

As of November 2019, Fido&#x27; allows customers to pick a rate plan with different usage limits for talk, text and data. After which the user can choose a new device if interested as well as how much of the device cost they like to pay upfront. Device costs are spread out over a 2-year term. This means that user has to pay a fixed amount for their new device over the term. Once the term expires, monthly payment will decrease to the rate plan portion of the payment that has been made.

===Mobile Internet===
Fido offers several plans and add-ons for customers wishing to access Internet content via its mobile network using a BlackBerry, feature phone, mobile broadband modem, or smartphone.

Unlimited mobile Internet access is only available on feature phones. It is no longer possible to pay per month for such access, as only daily and weekly Internet add-ons are unlimited. Smartphone add-ons, except for those BlackBerry-related, can be used on a feature phone.

Smartphones can browse the Internet with a tiered add-on. This includes for and for . If this allowance is exceeded, usage-based billing begins, costing for an amount equivalent to that initially included with the add-on.

Unique BlackBerry Internet Service options are available for BlackBerry smartphones. Unlimited BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) is included on all plans or more, such as CityFido Unlimited. For all plans, it is also possible to pay an additional fee to add or of data. Note that the option for BlackBerry devices costs more than the regular smartphone add-on.

Fido has been heavily criticized for discontinuing its unlimited Internet access plans and add-ons for devices other than feature phones. In response, the company occasionally releases a popular add-on, providing of data for . It requires a voice plan and hence cannot be used with an Internet access stick.

=== Home internet ===
In November 2015, Fido began to offer cable internet services in selected markets. The service is a re-branded Rogers Hi-Speed Internet, offering a 30 Mbit/s package with a bandwidth cap, with discounts as part of bundles with Fido post-paid mobile services. Fido internet is available to markets in Ontario that are served by Rogers&#x27; internet. The service is primarily aimed at millennials.

===Loyalty program=== 
Fido had a loyalty rewards program known as FidoDOLLARS. For every Fido monthly bill or prepaid top-up, a customers received 4% (previously 5% before September 6, 2012) of the pre-tax total in FidoDOLLARS. This currency would be used towards the purchase of a new device, purchase add-ons such as premium voicemail to text (), name display () or #auto () for a total of two months. As well as they were used to purchase travel packs as long as you had the full amount of fido dollars to do so. Prepaid customers would also use their FidoDOLLARS to purchase top-up credits. FidoDollars had no cash value and were non-transferable, except when transferring the responsibility of a number/contract from an account with only one line.

With the release of Fido&#x27;s new Pulse plans, FidoDOLLARS are no longer accumulated but existing FidoDOLLARS will remain on your account. However, if you are not on a Pulse plan you will continue to accumulate FidoDOLLARS as normal. To make up for the lack of FidoDOLLARS, Spotify Premium and Daily Vice are offered free of charge for 2 years ( value) in all new Pulse plans.

In January 2016, Fido announced a winddown and termination of the FidoDOLLARS program. See the next section for more details.

=== Perks ===
As the FidoDOLLARS program was wound down, July 2017 saw the introduction of Fido&#x27;s +5 Hours of Data, allowing customers on a pulse plan to enable 1 free hour of data, 5 individual times during each billing cycle. In May 2018, Fido introduced Fido XTRA which provides customers with perks from various retailers every Thursday, but Fido XTRA discontinued in 2023 .

===Discontinued services===

Fido once offered a wide range of services which it no longer offers. These have been discontinued either following the purchase of Fido by Rogers, or during &quot;The New Fido&quot; rebranding era.

Unlimited mobile broadband while in Canada or the United States, older CityFido plans and Sprint Canada bundles were some of the plan options removed after Rogers purchased Microcell. The unlimited mobile Internet access plans were replaced by tiered and rationed Internet access options, although feature phones were still eligible for unlimited access until early 2012. Only some legacy CityFido plans were grandfathered, and Fido now has new CityFido offerings. Sprint Canada bundles with Fido were temporarily replaced by &quot;Better Choices Bundles&quot; after Rogers purchased both companies.

Better Choices Bundles, couples plans, Danger Hiptop service, fax messaging, FullFido plans and mobile TV were all discontinued after &quot;The New Fido&quot; re-branding. Only some existing FullFido customers were grandfathered. The Better Choices Bundles program once offered up to 15% off a pre-tax Fido monthly bill when combined with one or more Rogers services, but Fido is now listed as a &quot;service[] that do[es]n&#x27;t qualify for the Better Choices Bundles Program&quot;. Couples plans were replaced by Circle Calling in 2011. Fax messaging was discontinued on September 22, 2007, but fax numbers could be ported out until December 22 of that year, and a similar service is still available at competitor Mike. The Mobile TV service offered up to 25 channels, but was discontinued due to a lack of subscribers. Competitors Bell Mobility and its MVNO Virgin Mobile Canada both offer a very similar feature called Bell Mobile TV.

Per-second billing on Fido&#x27;s postpaid monthly plans was discontinued on July 4, 2012. Customers with plans created and activated before that date are kept on per-second billing until they change to a newer plan.

The company changed their plan offerings, now bundling data with their Smart plans, and Max Plans. CityFido plans had a cost of $35 per month and are available in ten select CityFido zones throughout Canada. Unlimited features included incoming calls, outgoing local calls, international SMS text messages and BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) service while inside any CityFido zone.
In January 2016, Fido announced the termination of the FidoDOLLARS program. The earning of FidoDOLLARS ends on or shortly after April 6, 2016, for non-term monthly plans, and ends at the end of the current term for those FidoDOLLARS-earning plans that are on a contracted term. The non-term monthly customers were then told to use up (redeem) their FidoDOLLARS by July 6, 2016, whereas customers on a FidoDOLLARS-earning contracted term could redeem their FidoDOLLARS by July 6, 2018 (or else lose the FidoDOLLARS balance in both cases). Fido customers with multiple lines are deemed to be in the second category if at least one line is on a FidoDOLLARS-earning contracted term that goes beyond April 6, 2016. Many users in their community expressed dissatisfaction at the &quot;scam&quot; that their value had been arbitrarily taken by the company, or the only viable redemption option required a further contract.

In October 2024, Rogers announced that all Rogers and Fido prepaid services will be discontinued effective December 16, 2024, with customers directed to postpaid products and Chatr.

==Retail presence==
Fido has its own corporate retail stores, and also allows third parties to become exclusive dealers. For example, Best Buy, Costco, Tbooth, Walmart and WirelessWave sell Fido products along with prepaid and postpaid services. Additionally, Loblaw Companies and Zellers stores sold prepaid feature phones and top-up vouchers. Loblaw stores have a special booth, called The Mobile Shop, where the phones are displayed.

===Former retailers===
While Shoppers Drug Mart carried only Rogers Wireless prepaid phones at one time, the stores temporarily partnered with Rogers. As a result, Shoppers stores added both prepaid and postpaid products and services for Rogers and its two other brands, Fido and Chatr. Customers could also try out the iPhone 4. As of March 2011, however, Shoppers Drug Mart stores ended their partnership. They now only sell prepaid top-up vouchers for these providers.

<text>American Chopper is an American reality television series that airs on Discovery Channel, produced by Pilgrim Films &amp; Television. The series centers on Paul Teutul Sr. (frequently called &quot;Senior&quot;), and his son Paul Teutul Jr. (also known as &quot;Paulie&quot; or simply &quot;Junior&quot;), who manufacture custom chopper-style motorcycles. Orange County Choppers is in Newburgh, New York. The contrasting work and creative styles of the father-and-son team and their resulting verbal arguments were the series&#x27; hallmark until 2008 when an explosive argument led to Paul Jr.&#x27;s termination and departure to start a competing chopper company, Paul Jr. Designs.
The series originally aired on Discovery Channel beginning in March 2003. In December 2007, the series moved to Discovery&#x27;s sister channel TLC, starting off with an 18-hour marathon. Its first TLC season premiered in January 2008. Season 6 began in April 2009 but the series was canceled by TLC in February 2010. In July 2010, TLC announced that the Teutuls would return in a new series, &quot;American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior&quot;. Senior vs. Junior premiered on TLC but was soon moved to Discovery halfway through the first season. Discovery Channel announced that the show would end with &quot;The Chopper Live: The Revenge&quot; show on December 11, 2012 after 10 years.

== Featured staff ==
The OCC fabricators and mechanics such as Paul Teutul Jr., Rick Petko, Nick Hansford, Christian Welter, and former employees Vincent DiMartino (who left OCC to start V-Force Customs in 2007), and Cody Connelly (a BOCES student intern who has since joined DiMartino&#x27;s business), create dozens of custom motorbikes. Michael Teutul, usually referred to as &quot;Mikey&quot;, serves as the shop&#x27;s custodian and webmaster, and provides comic relief to the show. He has been seen doing metal work occasionally, as one of his early jobs was working at Orange County Ironworks. Also featured occasionally is Danny Teutul, the second oldest child, who succeeded Paul Sr. as the owner of Orange County Ironworks. Danny visits to do contracted work for the OCC facilities. The show also documents their personal and promotional activities ranging from magazine photo shoots to family holidays and custom bike shows.

== Original series (2002–2010) ==
=== Series overview ===


=== Fantasy Bike Contest === 
During season 3, Discovery Channel sponsored a contest in which four winners received OCC motorcycles. Custom bike features were specified by the winning fans, who sent in videos expressing their reasons for wanting a bike. The contest winners were (in episode order): Jeff Clegg (&quot;Corporal Punishment&quot;), Susan Morisset (&quot;Female Snake Bike&quot;), Joseph McClendon (&quot;Custom Hog&quot;), Bryan King (&quot;Vertebrate Trike&quot;).

=== Paul Jr. leaves Orange County Choppers ===
Following regular disagreements with his father, Paul Jr. was fired from the shop in late 2008. In January 2009, TLC served a notice of default due to Paul Jr.&#x27;s absence. Paul Jr. then returned to OCC briefly as a contractor, but left finally in April 2009 in order to start his own design firm, Paul Jr. Designs. Paul Sr. then exercised a contractual option to purchase Paul Jr.&#x27;s 20% share in OCC, and subsequently filed a lawsuit to force the buyout. The case remained ongoing while a valuation of OCC was performed.

On December 14, 2010, Paul Jr. won his appeal of a lower court ruling forcing him to sell his 20% ownership of OCC to Paul Sr. Paul Jr.&#x27;s appeal asked that the agreement to sell be ruled invalid, so Paul Jr. will continue to own 20% of OCC until a fair selling price is agreed to. Paul Jr. has also filed a counter-suit laying out massive fraud on Paul Sr.&#x27;s part in dealing with Paul Jr.&#x27;s interests at OCC. The suit seeks $100 million in damages along with court-ordered controls over the company&#x27;s finances to prevent further fraud.

After a one-year non-compete clause ended, Paul Jr. opened a motorcycle design company in April 2010. TLC then commissioned a 7th season titled &quot;American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior&quot; which features both OCC and Paul Jr. Designs.

=== Other legal issues ===
As of May 26, 2009, OCC is the defendant in a legal action filed by artist Justin Barnes, who alleges that his original designs were copied on merchandise without his permission and appropriate compensation.

In July 2009, Cody Connelly sued OCC and Paul Teutul Sr., seeking damages for misappropriation of likeness, breach of contract and fraud. He claimed the show used his likeness in posters, coloring books and other merchandise after he left it in 2007. Connelly also claimed that he never received &quot;the old school chopper&quot; that he helped design, though Paul Teutul Sr., said it would be his in one episode of the show.

=== Cancellation and Senior vs. Junior ===
On February 6, 2010, TLC announced that American Chopper&#x27;s season finale scheduled for February 11 would also mark the end of the series, stating, &quot;The Teutuls will always be a part of the Discovery family and we congratulate them on a tremendously successful series run.&quot; On April 7, TLC announced the Teutuls would return for a new series.

The new series, &quot;American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior&quot;, chronicles the aftermath of Paul Jr.&#x27;s departure from OCC and his construction of a new custom chopper company across the street from younger brother Dan&#x27;s Orange County Iron Works. It premiered August 12, 2010 on TLC.

In December 2010, &quot;Senior vs. Junior&quot; was moved to the Discovery Channel, the network &quot;American Chopper&quot; originally debuted on. In Canada &quot;American Chopper&quot; started on January 8 on TLC and moved to Saturday nights at 10 p.m.

On February 7, 2011, Paul Teutul Jr. announced that &quot;American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior&quot; had been renewed for a second season and would return spring 2011.

<text>The King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, is a ceremonial unit of the British Army, quartered at Woolwich. It is a mounted unit and all of its soldiers are trained to care for and drive teams of six horses, each team pulling a First World War-era QF 13-pounder gun; six teams are used in the unit&#x27;s Musical Drive. The Troop&#x27;s duties include firing salutes on royal and state occasions, participation in parades, and the duties of the King&#x27;s Life Guard at Horse Guards for one month each year. The unit provides the gun carriage and team of black horses for state funerals. The unit is most often seen providing gun salutes on state occasions in Hyde Park, and Green Park.

==History==

After the Second World War, King George VI expressed the view that, following the mechanisation of the last batteries of horse-drawn artillery, a troop of horse artillery should be retained to take part in the great ceremonies of state. Accordingly the Riding Troop was reformed on 17 April 1946 at Shoeburyness as a six-gun Royal Horse Artillery battery for the Household Division.

At the suggestion of Brigadier John Anquetil Norman, the King declared that the Riding Troop would be known as &#x27;The King&#x27;s Troop&#x27;. The King issued his proclamation on 24 October 1947 by amending the page on the visitors&#x27; book by striking out the word &quot;Riding&quot; and inserting &quot;King&#x27;s&quot;. On her accession, Queen Elizabeth II declared that the name &#x27;The King&#x27;s Troop&#x27; would remain in honour of her father.

On 6 September 1997, members of the King&#x27;s Troop Royal Horse Artillery carried the coffin of Diana, Princess of Wales on a gun carriage to her funeral.

On 14 September 2022, members of the King&#x27;s Troop Royal Horse Artillery carried the coffin of Elizabeth II on a gun carriage from Buckingham Palace to lie in state at Westminster Hall.
The King&#x27;s Troop was for 65 years stationed at St John&#x27;s Wood Barracks before it was relocated to Napier Lines (also known as King George VI Lines) at the traditional Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich in February 2012. Because of the greater distance from central London, the troop can no longer ride to many ceremonial events. Horses are transported by vehicle to stables in central London for appearances at Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and elsewhere.

The King&#x27;s Troop has about 140 members. Women were able to apply from 1996, and eventually made up about 40% of the Troop.

==Role==


===Musical Drive===
The King&#x27;s Troop Royal Horse Artillery performed their Musical Drive at every Royal Tournament from its formation in 1947 to the final Royal Tournament on 2 August 1999. The Musical Drive can be seen at shows around the United Kingdom and always at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in May every year.

Many of the manoeuvres of the Musical Drive have remained unchanged since it was first performed in 1897. The start, known as the Big Drive, features the Scissors, where the whole team criss-cross at gallop, displaying choreography, teamwork and discipline. Another manoeuvre, the Wagon Wheel, depicts an inner wheel, spokes, and an outer wheel.

For a &quot;Hero&#x27;s Welcome&quot; event in Windsor in May 2008 there were six gun teams, each of ten horses and seven riders. Women, first admitted to the King&#x27;s Troop in 1996, made up one-third of the display team. Major Erica Bridge was the first female officer commanding the King&#x27;s Troop.

===Trooping the Colour===
Together with the Household Division the King&#x27;s Troop has appeared every June since 1997, when it made its first appearance, at Trooping the Colour, on Horse Guards Parade to celebrate the King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Official Birthday. At the end of the event, the King&#x27;s Troop ranks past the King.

After the ceremony, the King&#x27;s Troop moves to Green Park, adjacent to Buckingham Palace, firing a 41-gun salute, which is a 21-gun salute with an additional 20 rounds fired because the gun position is in a Royal Park.

===King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Life Guard===
One of the regular duties undertaken by the King&#x27;s Troop is to mount the King&#x27;s Life Guard on Horse Guards Parade. Although this is primarily the role of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, every summer this unit goes away for 2–3 weeks for summer training (and to provide a break for their horses) to Norfolk. During this period, the King&#x27;s Troop takes over responsibility for providing the mounted sentries.

==Order of precedence==
In the British Army Order of Precedence, the Household Cavalry is listed first and normally parades at the extreme right of the line. However, when the Royal Horse Artillery is on parade with its guns, they take on the honour of taking right of the line.

==Film &quot;The Troop&quot;==
A 35mm CinemaScope film, &quot;The Troop&quot;, was filmed in Windsor Great Park and at &#x27;The Wood&#x27; barracks. The film had a royal premiere before the Princess Royal at BAFTA in September 1999. The Glory Film Co. production was produced and directed by Marcus Dillistone, the associate producer was Paul-Anthony Viollet (a former Troop Officer) and the introduction was spoken by Sir John Mills. Music was composed by Julian Scott and performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

<doc id="959782" wikidata="Q6847856" url="?curid=959782" title="Mike May (skier)">
<text>Michael G. May (born 1953) is an American business executive, skier and enthusiast of other sports who was blinded by a chemical explosion at the age of three, but regained partial vision in 2000, at the age of 46, after cornea transplants and a pioneering stem cell procedure by San Francisco ophthalmologist Daniel Goodman. In 1999, May founded the Sendero Group in Davis, California, United States, which employs many individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Sendero has assisted those with sight disabilities by producing the first accessible GPS solution for blind persons. The Sendero Group&#x27;s GPS technology received the Consumer Electronics Show&#x27;s &quot;Innovation Honoree&quot; title in 2004 and 2009.

Among his many accomplishments, May holds the record for downhill skiing by a person who is completely blind (racing at 65 mph). He competed in the alpine skiing event at the 1984 Winter Paralympics and won three bronze medals in the downhill, giant slalom, and combination events.

==Restoration of sight==
In 2003, three years after May&#x27;s eye operation, the results were mixed. May was unable to grasp three-dimensional vision or recognize members of his family by their faces alone.

Siu and Morley (2008) propose that following seven days of visual deprivation, a potential decrease in vision may occur. They also found an increasing degree of visual impairment following thirty-day and 120-day periods of deprivation. The Siu and Morley study suggests that the function of the brain is dependent upon visual input. The effect of visual loss affects the development of the visual cortex of the brain—the visual impairment causes the occipital lobe to lose its sensitivity in perceiving spatial processing. 

May lost his eyesight at the age of three when his vision was not fully developed; he was unable yet to distinguish shapes, drawings, or images clearly. Consequently, it was anticipated that he would experience difficulty describing the outside world in comparison to a normal-sighted person, for example, it would be difficult for May to differentiate between complex shapes, dimensions, and the orientation of objects. Hannan (2006) hypothesized that the temporal visual cortex uses prior memory and experiences to make sense of shapes, colors, and forms. Hannan proposed that the long-term effect of blindness in the visual cortex is an inability to recognize spatial cues. Cohen et al. (1997) suggest that early blindness causes poor development of the visual cortex, with a resulting decrease in somatosensory development. Cohen&#x27;s study proposes that May&#x27;s long term blindness affects his ability to distinguish between faces of males and females, and to recognize pictures and images. In spite of the surgery on May&#x27;s right eye, his regained vision is not fully recovered after forty years of blindness. Thinus-Blanc and Gaunet (1997) suggest that people who are blind early in life show a limited ability in the area of spatial representation. May&#x27;s early blindness resulted in visual cortex cells unaccustomed to the new stimuli in his surroundings.

Cohen et al. (1997) propose that, during their early years, blinded subjects develop a strong inclination for tactile discrimination tasks. May has developed very precise senses of hearing and touch.

==Personal life==
May and his ex-wife, Jennifer, had two sons, Carson and Wyndham. Carson died while skiing, likely due to an avalanche, in January 2016.

==Biography==
In 2006, journalist Robert Kurson wrote a book on May that was expanded from an article Kurson wrote for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. The book, &quot;Crashing Through: A True Story of Risk, Adventure and the Man Who Dared to See&quot;, was released on May 15, 2007.

==Film adaptation==
Interest was expressed within the film industry regarding the translation of May&#x27;s story into a motion picture, and, as of July 2011, Stone Village Productions and DRO Entertainment owned the rights to the film adaptation of Kurson&#x27;s book. Emmy Award-winning screenwriter, Adam Mazer, had been employed to write the script.

<doc id="959784" wikidata="Q492184" url="?curid=959784" title="Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms">
<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Body Guard of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms is a bodyguard to the British Monarch. Until 17 March 1834, they were known as The Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners.

==Formation==

The corps was formed as the Troop of Gentlemen in 1509 by King Henry VIII to act as a mounted escort, armed with spear and lance to protect the sovereign, in battle or elsewhere. Henry decided to have &quot;this new and sumptuous Troop of Gentlemen composed of cadets of noble families and the highest order of gentry as his personal Body Guard or &#x27;Nearest Guard&#x27;&quot;, cadets being the younger sons of nobles.

As his bodyguard, it accompanied Henry to France in 1513 and took part in the Battle of Guinegate (1513) (better known as the Battle of the Spurs) and then at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. In 1526, they became a dismounted bodyguard armed with battleaxes. They last saw service in battle during the English Civil War, during which a Gentleman Matthews saved the Prince of Wales at the Battle of Edgehill (1642) from one of the Earl of Essex&#x27;s troopers. They were always intended as a primarily ceremonial unit, but were on regular duty until the 19th century.

Under Henry VIII, the Troop of Gentlemen varied in size, according to funding available. As the &quot;Nearest Guard&quot; to the Monarch, the unit attracted an aristocratic and aspiring membership, which could be utilised as a cadre of young officers when levies were raised for overseas service.

==Duties==

Today, the duties are purely ceremonial: the Gentlemen accompany and attend the sovereign at various events and occasions, including state visits by heads of state, the opening of parliament, and ceremonies involving the various orders of chivalry, including the Order of the Garter. The Gentlemen now parade for the State Opening of Parliament, state visits, royal garden parties, the Garter service, receptions of the diplomatic corps, royal weddings, coronations, the Investiture of the Prince of Wales, lyings in state and State Funerals. They also have three mess dinners annually.

==Officers and administration==

The Corps today consists of five Officers (the Captain, the Lieutenant, the Standard Bearer, the Clerk of the Cheque and Adjutant and the Harbinger) and 24 Gentlemen. The senior Officer is the Captain, a political appointee who is now always the Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords. The senior permanent officer is the Lieutenant. The Clerk of the Cheque and Adjutant issues all orders to the Corps. The Harbinger runs the Mess and assists the Clerk. The Mess, at St. James&#x27;s Palace, is run by a permanent Axe Keeper and Butler. All Officers (except the Captain) must have served in the Corps prior to promotion to officer rank. In the 17th century, there was also the office of Paymaster of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms and Co-Paymaster of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms.

==Membership and age limits==
All subordinate officers, and all Gentlemen, must be under the age of 55 years on joining, and are on average 52. The Gentlemen retain their prior military ranks (currently most rank between major and colonel). They must retire at 70 years.

Although all Gentlemen are retired officers, uniquely one recent member is also a clergyman. Colonel the Reverend Richard (&quot;Dick&quot;) H. Whittington joined the Corps in 1999 after retiring from the Corps of Royal Engineers. He was ordained a deacon in 1993 and a priest in 1994. He was Chaplain of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 2001 to 2013.

Another notable Gentleman was Major Walter Clopton Wingfield, one of the pioneers of lawn tennis, who served from 1870 to 1909.

==Uniform==

The uniform is that of a Dragoon Guards officer of the 1840s. It has a skirted red coatee with Garter blue velvet cuffs and facings embroidered with the Tudor royal badge of the portcullis. Helmets with white swan feather plumes are worn when on duty, even in church. Officers wear, in addition, gold aiguillettes, and carry sticks of office—gold for the Captain, silver for the Lieutenant, Standard Bearer and Clerk of the Cheque, and ivory for the Harbinger—which they receive from the Sovereign on appointment. Cavalry swords are worn, and long ceremonial battle-axes, over 300 years old, are carried by all the Gentlemen.

The uniforms are produced by the royal warrant holder Gieves &amp; Hawkes from Savile Row in London, with the helmets handcrafted and maintained by the royal warrant holder Thomas Lyte at their goldsmithing and silversmithing workshops, also in London.

==Standard==
The corps carries a standard, similar to that carried by cavalry and infantry regiments of the British Army, upon which is mounted the corps&#x27; various accoutrements and a selection of its battle honours. In the case of the Gentlemen at Arms, this is a swallowtailed standard of crimson edged in gold. The cross of St George is at the hoist. Next to this is the Royal Cipher of the reigning monarch, with the name of the corps (&quot;Gentlemen at Arms&quot;) put diagonally from top to bottom. Between the two pieces of text is the corps&#x27; portcullis badge, while at the end of the standard are a selection of battle honours. In 2009, at a celebration of the Corps&#x27; 500 years of personal service to the Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II presented a special riband to be displayed on the Standard.

==Battle honours==

* 1520 Field of Cloth of Gold
* 1544 Siege of Boulogne
