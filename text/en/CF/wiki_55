<text>Mountmellick or Mountmellic () is a town in the north of County Laois, Ireland. It is on the N80 road, 6 km north of Portlaoise. The town is within Mountmellick Roman Catholic parish.

==Name==

&quot;Mountmellick&quot;, sometimes spelt &quot;Montmellick&quot; or &quot;Montmellic&quot;, is an anglicisation of the Irish name &quot;Móinteach Mílic&quot;, which means &quot;(the) bog of/by (the) land bordering a river&quot;. Older anglicisations include &quot;Mointaghmeelick, Montaghmelick, Montiaghmeelick&quot; and &quot;Monteaghmilick&quot;.

==History==
Mountmellick was a 15th-century settlement on the narrow Owenass River (&#x27;River of the Falls&#x27; in Irish) with an encampment on its banks at Irishtown. Overlooking this valley with its trees and wildlife was a small church called Kilmongan (Ivy Chapel) which was closed by the Penal Laws in 1640.

English Quakers settled in the area from about 1657, led by William Edmundson. They saw a future for this settlement and built it into a town, which was to grow to 8,000 people, with 27 industries which included breweries, a distillery, woollen mills, cotton, tanneries and glass. It was a boomtown in the late 19th century. One of its earliest Quaker settlers (circa 1680) was Richard Jackson, who, with his brother Anthony, had been converted to Quakerism in Eccleston, by the missionaries George Fox and Edmundson. Jackson&#x27;s older brother Anthony settled at Oldcastle in County Meath at about the same time that Jackson and his wife, Margaret Keete, came to Mountmellick. Nicholas Jackson, who may have been a son of Richard Jackson, and had been born in Lancashire, married an Anne Mann in Mountmellick in about 1702. Descendants of Nicholas and Anne Jackson emigrated to New Garden Township, Pennsylvania in the 1710s. Isaac Jackson, Nicholas&#x27;s uncle, also settled near New Garden Township, in 1725, in an area the family later called Harmony Grove. There is still a Quaker population in the town, and a Friends meeting house. The town has numerous examples of Georgian architecture and one of the finest examples of a Georgian square in Ireland.

===The Manchester of Ireland===

Such was the level of industrial activity in the area in the late 18th century that Mountmellick became known as &quot;The Manchester of Ireland&quot;. Its role as a textile producer during the industrial revolution of the mid-1700s brought favourable comparisons to Manchester, the industrial centre of England at the time.

Deciduous woodlands, which once covered Laois, provided a source of bark for a tanning industry, which converted animal hides into leather. William Edmundson (1627–1712), the first Quaker to settle in Mountmellick, owned a tannery, and the Goodbodys and Pim families also owned tanneries in the 19th century. Towards the end of the 18th century, the textile industry grew significantly. A number of large mills were opened in the 1780s. These produced the necessary raw materials to develop weaving as an important cottage industry, providing farming households with a secondary source of income. By 1837, it was estimated that 4,000 people were employed in the cotton and woollen industry in the Mountmellick area.

The three main centres of this industry were established at New Mills in Drinagh, Barkmills, near Ballyfin and Anngrove in Irishtown. Initially these mills were powered by water, but steam engines were gradually introduced during the 19th Century.

In 1801, there were five breweries in Mountmellick and these supplied beer to towns within a 25-mile radius. These breweries declined as larger breweries elsewhere developed their distribution on the railways and canals. As the temperance movement grew in the second half of the 19th century, there was a shift from brewing to malting. Two malting enterprises in Irishtown were developed by the Codd family in the early 20th century and malt production still takes place in Mountmellick today.

The first bank in the town was opened 1824 and the first modern sugar factory in Ireland was opened in Mountmellick in 1852. It was situated behind the present MDA building in Irishtown. Despite its aspirations, economic factors led to its closure in 1862.

===The Great Famine===

The population of the town declined by 35% during the Great Famine, seeing a drop from 4,800 to 3,120 inhabitants between 1845 and 1850. A further 3,000 people lived in close proximity to the town in 1841, many of whom were also affected. Up to this time, Mountmellick had been an extensive manufacturing town, but as the famine took grip, employment plummeted and money became very scarce. Food prices increased by 300%. People caught in a poverty trap became hungry and destitute. Diseases such as typhus and cholera appeared and more people in Mountmellick died from a fever epidemic at the time than from the famine itself.

Aid relief was sent from various parts of the world during this period. The Quakers were among the most active in famine relief initiatives and they opened soup kitchens throughout Ireland. The Poor Law Union built a workhouse in Mountmellick in 1839. The workhouse was situated on the site where St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital now stands. It was built to feed and accommodate 800 paupers, but at the height of famine in 1847 (known as &quot;Black &#x27;47&quot;) there were 1,500 people there. To deter people, the workhouses were designed to be as unattractive as possible. Husbands, wives and children were separated on entry and often never saw each other again.

Mass burial sites were dug to bury the victims. A cart of famine victims was brought daily from the workhouse to pit graves in the townland of Derryguile, one mile outside Mountmellick. A field, now known as &quot;Reilig&quot; (the Irish language word for grave) in the townland of Graigue is also known to have been a famine burial site.

Local families who left during this time, or earlier, during the late 17th century, included the Newlins (who went to Chester County, Pennsylvania), Pims, Bewleys, and Dennys. Many of the earlier Quakers emigrated from Mountmellick to Pennsylvania.

===Mountmellick lace===
According to tradition, in 1825 a Quaker named Joanna Carter introduced what later became known as Mountmellick embroidery. The first known sale of this type of lacework was to the Earl of Dunraven (Lord Adare) of Limerick in 1847.

Although Carter is credited with its introduction, little is known about her. She ran a small school in a thatched house and taught at least 15 girls. Her annual income was £9 per year. Although the precise location of her home is not known, the &#x27;Primary Valuation of Tenements&#x27; indicates that a John Carter lived in a house in Pond Street, Mountmellick in 1850. In the report on the Irish Industrial Exhibition of 1853, Joanna Carter was referred to as, &#x27;Carter, J Mountmellick, Queen&#x27;s County, Designer and Manufacturer, embroidered quilt, toilet cover and doileys&#x27;. The report also stated that she was responsible for the design and execution of a richly embroidered quilt exhibited by the Countess of Eglinton. Another woman associated with the early development of Mountmellick embroidery was Margaret Beale (1809–1877). Originally from Enniscorthy, County Wexford, she was married to Joseph Beale, a prominent manufacturer in the town.

Mountmellick was a significant industrial town before the Great Famine of the mid-19th century, when it was known as &#x27;The Manchester of Ireland&#x27; or &#x27;little Manchester&#x27;. This was partly thanks to the Grand Canal, the Mountmellick branch of which is now filled in. Mountmellick embroidery, also known as Mountmellick Lace, became one of the most popular forms of needlework during the 19th century, and early examples fetch high prices on the international market. The local museum displays original pieces of this craftwork.

The history of needlework in Mountmellick before the 19th century is unclear. However, when the Society of Friends opened its school in Mountmellick in 1786, the girls were instructed in needlework to earn money for their textbooks. There appear to have been strong links between Mountmellick embroidery and the Quaker Leinster Provincial School in the town. They fostered the tradition of embroidery by both teaching it and adapting their own designs. A government school report of 1858 recorded that plain and fancy needlework was being taught at the school. The same report also noted that plain and fancy needlework was taught to girls at the Church of Ireland School Mountmellick. The Presentation order was heavily involved in the promotion of the craft. In 1920 when the Quaker school closed, the Presentation Sisters moved into the school and continued its embroidery tradition.

In about 1880, a Mrs Milner started an industrial association in Mountmellick to provide a livelihood &#x27;for distressed Irish gentlewomen&#x27;. By 1890, it is known to have had 50 women employed in producing the embroidery. This seems to have led to an upsurge in interest in it. It was taken up by women throughout the country; as a consequence, it ceased to be just a local craft. A Mrs Florance Patterson, an architect from Craigivad, County Down, was an expert in needlework, including Mountmellick embroidery. At this time it seems that Mountmellick embroidery was gaining international recognition. For example, in 1885, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, visited Ireland and the industrial association presented her with a dressing-table cover in Mountmellick embroidery. Between 1890 and 1898, Weldon, a London publisher, produced four volumes called &#x27;Weldon&#x27;s Practical Mountmellick embroidery&#x27;. Altogether, Weldon published eight volumes on the subject and helped to make the embroidery more popular. Barour&#x27;s Prize Needle-Work series, published in the 1890s Boston, USA, included a section on Mountmellick embroidery. One consequence of its increased popularity was that the emphasis changed from its being a source of income for the poor to being a middle-class social pastime.

The production of Mountmellick embroidery and other forms of needlework began to decline during the 19th century. By 1907, the number of people employed in the production of the embroidery had fallen from 50 to eight. Despite this, it maintained an international reputation for quality, style and durability. In 1963, US President John F. Kennedy was presented with a white Mountmellick embroidery quilt by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.

The tradition of Mountmellick embroidery is maintained through weekly classes which are held in the Mountmellick Development Association building.

==Coat of arms==
The chief herald of Ireland assigned a coat of arms to Mountmellick Town Commission on 16 December 1998.

The motto, displayed on the town&#x27;s coat of arms, translates as &quot;friendship through partnership&quot;. The fretted design represents Mountmellick Work, an embroidery craft unique to the town. The diagonally-running wave represents the Owenass river, which embraces much of the town. The crosses reflect the foundation of the town by the Society of Friends or Quakers. These heraldic elements are &#x27;crosses moline&#x27;, and derive from the mill-rind, the iron centre of a millstone. They reflect a former Mountmellick industry. The sprigs of &quot;Andromeda polifolia&quot;, or bog rosemary, are representative of the name place, Mointech Milic. Mointeach means &quot;mooreland,&quot; reclaimed bogland, and Milic means wetland.

==Education==
Mountmellick has four primary schools: St Joseph&#x27;s Girls&#x27; National School and St Patrick&#x27;s Boys&#x27; National School, built in 1973, which share a building; St Paul&#x27;s National School on the Portlaoise Road, and The Rock National School, St Patrick&#x27;s Boys School one mile out on the Dublin road. There is also a community school in the town square, serving secondary-age pupils. Until its closure in the early 21st century, the nearby Patrician College secondary school in Ballyfin, had a portion of its pupils travel from Mountmellick by bus each day.

==Economic activity==
The town&#x27;s main industries are agriculture, light manufacturing and brewing. It serves as a dormitory town for nearby Portlaoise and for Dublin, with easy access to the M7 motorway and the Dublin-Cork railway line. This has led to the population of Mountmellick expanding rapidly in the years between 2004 and 2012 and also to an increase in new houses and several new housing estates during the Celtic Tiger era and beyond until the Irish financial crisis.

==Sport==
Mountmellick GAA is the town&#x27;s club for Gaelic football and hurling, while other nearby Gaelic games clubs are The Rock GAA and Kilcavan.

Sarsfields Ladies football club is the town&#x27;s club for Ladies gaelic football.

Mountmellick Athletic Club, an athletics club based in the town, was accepting new members as of January 2020, but was reportedly &quot;not active&quot; by mid-2021.

==Transport==
===Road===
Mountmellick is on the N80 national secondary road, and also the R422 and R423 regional roads. 

===Bus===
Mountmellick is served by Bus Éireann as part of its route between Athlone and Waterford, with three daily services in each direction. It is also on the local Townlink route, with daily connections to Portlaoise and Tullamore.

===Rail===
Mountmellick railway station opened on 2 March 1885, at the end of a short branch from Portlaoise. It was originally planned that the line would be extended to Geashill but this never happened leaving it as a dead end. It closed to passengers on 27 January 1947, but the branch remained open for sugar beet and special trains until 1 January 1963. The station building is now a private residence.

===Canal===
The Mountmellick branch of the Grand Canal became operational in March 1831 and closed in 1960.

== Notes ==
:1.The house that Isaac Jackson&#x27;s grandson built in Pennsylvania still stands there, and is a Pennsylvania Historical site, as it was used as a way-station on the Underground Railroad during the civil war by Jackson descendants. Isaac sired a long line of Quaker families down to William Miller Jones (b. Philadelphia, 1852) who converted to Catholicism and hyphenated his middle and last names as Miller-Jones. To this day his heirs continue to use the Miller-Jones surname.

<text>Simon Green (born 30 March 1976), known by his stage name Bonobo, is an English musician, producer, and DJ based in Los Angeles. He debuted with a trip hop aesthetic and has since explored more upbeat approaches as well as jazz and world music influences. His electronic sound incorporates the use of organic instrumentation and is recreated by a full band in live performances.

==Career==
===1999–2009===
Green debuted in 1999 on the Tru Thoughts compilation &quot;When Shapes Join Together&quot;. His stage name Bonobo is a reference to the great ape species. Following the release of the EP &quot;Scuba&quot;, on the Brighton-based label Fly Casual Recordings, and the single &quot;Terrapin&quot;, Bonobo was offered label deals with XL Recordings and Mute Records, but he chose to remain with Tru Thoughts.

His first album, &quot;Animal Magic&quot;, was published on the same label in 2000, to mixed reviews. Paul Cooper of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that it &quot;breaks no new ground for chill-out&quot;, while &quot;PopMatters&quot; said Bonobo &quot;[showcases] smooth breakbeat loops, synth sounds, and aforementioned dub effects. [And his] electronic music draws on live playing.&quot; Reviewer Dean Carlson also said that the album &quot;slowly takes shape as a solid debut of narcoleptic downtempo&quot;. In spite of these reactions, &quot;Animal Magic&quot; has gained Bonobo a cult following. Its accompanying compilation album, titled &quot;One Offs...&quot;, was issued in 2002 and contains reworked songs and rarities.

In 2001, Bonobo was signed to Coldcut&#x27;s label Ninja Tune, and in 2003, he released &quot;Dial &#x27;M&#x27; for Monkey&quot;. John Bush of AllMusic stated in a review that Bonobo&#x27;s influences were drawn more towards alternative rock and world music rather than hip hop or trip hop. The album tracks &quot;Pick up&quot; and &quot;Flutter&quot; were featured in the snowboarding game &quot;SSX on Tour&quot;.

In 2005, Bonobo contributed to the &quot;Solid Steel&quot; series with &quot;It Came from the Sea&quot;. The mix features several exclusive tracks as well as remixes and re-edits. His third album, entitled &quot;Days to Come&quot;, was released on 2 October 2006. An AllMusic review states that &quot;[Bonobo] breathes new life into a well-worn genre.&quot; With the album as well as his future work, he featured vocalists such as Bajka, thus &quot;adding [an] organic and vibrant musicality that&#x27;s rare in electronic music.&quot; &quot;Days to Come&quot; was voted Best Album of 2006 by Gilles Peterson&#x27;s listeners. The song &quot;Nightlite&quot; appeared on &quot;UEFA Champions League 2006–2007&quot;, and &quot;Recurring&quot; was used in a surfing film broadcast on Fuel TV.

===2010–2015===
The song &quot;The Keeper&quot;, featuring vocals by Andreya Triana, was issued in September 2009 as the lead single from Bonobo&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Black Sands&quot;, released in March 2010. A BBC review by Paul Clarke stated that &quot;Green has progressed from predominantly sample-based production to more live instrumentation [and] has become equally adept at mastering [...] multi-layered atmospheres.&quot; In the same review, Clarke also commented that the song &quot;We Could Forever&quot; &quot;saddles an Afro-inflected guitar and skittish flute to deep sub-bass&quot; and &quot;Kiara&quot; combines &quot;oriental strings with cut-up beats&quot;. After their collaboration for &quot;Black Sands&quot;, Green produced Triana&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Lost Where I Belong&quot;. The Bonobo song &quot;Kong&quot; was used during a scene in an artist&#x27;s studio in the eighth episode of the second season of &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

In February 2012, &quot;Black Sands Remixed&quot; was released on Ninja Tune, featuring tracks from the original &quot;Black Sands&quot; record remixed by electronic producers such as Machinedrum, Lapalux, Floating Points, and Mark Pritchard.

The first single off the next Bonobo album, &quot;Cirrus&quot;, was given its worldwide debut on Gilles Peterson&#x27;s BBC Radio 6 program on 19 January 2013. The album, titled &quot;The North Borders&quot;, was set for release on 1 April 2013 but came out early in its digital format after a promotional copy was leaked prior to the planned launch date. &quot;The North Borders&quot; marked Bonobo&#x27;s first UK and US album chart entries, where they respectively reached numbers 34 and 122. &quot;Cirrus&quot; was featured as the closing song of the pilot episode for the AMC show &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;.

Bonobo produced the song &quot;Pulls&quot; by DELS for his 2014 album, &quot;Petals Have Fallen&quot;, which was released under Big Dada—a sister label of Ninja Tune.

===2016–present===
Bonobo released his sixth album, &quot;Migration&quot;, in January 2017. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, he stated that he conceived the album from &quot;living and being in various locations&quot;, as he toured extensively and did not &quot;have a home base for about a year&quot;. The album and the track &quot;Bambro Koyo Ganda&quot; were nominated at the 2018 Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronic Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively. The record peaked at number 5 on the UK chart and 59 in the US. In 2018, it won Album of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards, and the artist was nominated for Live Act of the Year.

On 1 July 2019, Bonobo released a new song, &quot;Linked&quot;, online. The track was later nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 62nd Grammy Awards but lost to &quot;Got to Keep On&quot; by the Chemical Brothers.

The following year, Bonobo remixed Michael Kiwanuka&#x27;s song &quot;Final Days&quot;.

Bonobo&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Fragments&quot;, was released on 14 January 2022, with five singles issued ahead of its release. The first one, &quot;Rosewood&quot;, debuted on 6 October 2021, followed by &quot;Tides&quot;—a collaboration with Jamila Woods—on 20 October. &quot;Otomo&quot;—a collaboration with O&#x27;Flynn—came out on 10 November, followed by &quot;Shadows&quot;, with Jordan Rakei, on 1 December. The fifth and final single, &quot;From You&quot;, with Joji, was released on 3 January 2022.

Bonobo was nominated for the Brit Award for British Dance Act in 2023.

Bonobo is set to produce music for the upcoming Japanese anime television series &quot;Lazarus&quot;, directed by Shinichirō Watanabe.

==Musical style==
Bonobo&#x27;s sound is oriented on beats and samples but typically &quot;soothing&quot;, combining influences ranging from club to world music. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named him a key figure in the 2000s downtempo electronica scene, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; associated him with the recent popularity of &quot;ambient world electronica&quot;. While his earliest work was firmly based in trip hop, his style soon became more upbeat and delved into genres such as jazz (which has led him to be described as a nu jazz artist) and traditional Indian music. He has collaborated with various artists, including Bajka, Andreya Triana, Erykah Badu, and Rhye, who have contributed vocals to songs on several of his albums.

Green has also performed with Robert Luis of the Tru Thoughts label under the aliases Nirobi and Barakas.

Whilst often touring solo and performing DJ sets and residencies, in 2010, Bonobo opted to start touring with a full band for the &quot;Black Sands&quot; tour. The group plays live renditions of studio material, with a singer, keyboardist, guitarist, saxophonist, string section, electronics, and drummer, often with improvisations and solos.

<text>Novgorod () was a monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1870s. She was one of the most unusual warships ever constructed, and still survives in popular naval myth as one of the worst warships ever built. However, a more balanced assessment shows that she was relatively effective in her designed role as a coast-defence ship. The hull was circular to reduce draught while allowing the ship to carry much more armour and a heavier armament than other ships of the same size. &quot;Novgorod&quot; played a minor role in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and was reclassified as a coast-defence ironclad in 1892. The ship was decommissioned in 1903 and used as a storeship until she was sold for scrap in 1911.

==Background==
In 1868, the Scottish shipbuilder John Elder published an article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area that needed to be protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a ship with a narrower beam, as was the typical practice of the day. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder&#x27;s conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder&#x27;s concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder&#x27;s convex hull, to minimise its draught.

Popov designed &quot;Novgorod&quot; to meet an 1869 requirement to defend the Dnieper-Bug Estuary and the Kerch Strait. The requirement was for four very heavily armoured ships of draught and armed with rifled guns, for which the total programme cost should not exceed four million rubles. The met all of the requirements except that their armament was not powerful enough, so General-Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich selected Popov&#x27;s circular design in late December 1869. A model was built with a circular hull and performed well during tests in the Baltic Sea at St. Petersburg in April 1870; when Tsar Alexander II received reports of the trials, he nicknamed the ship a &quot;popovka&quot;, a diminutive form of the designer&#x27;s name.

Popov submitted several designs to the General-Admiral who selected the largest of these for a ship that displaced , in diameter, and armed with four 11-inch guns on 7 June. This ironclad was estimated to cost 4.14 million rubles, more than the total cost of the entire programme, and Popov was forced to scale down his design. On 24 October, the Tsar approved his design for a ship in diameter, armed with two 11-inch guns, and protected by of armour. It was estimated to cost 1.94 million roubles per ship and the total cost of the programme, including improvements to the shipyards, would cost 8.5 million rubles. For further testing, the &quot;Kambala&quot; (&quot;Flounder&quot;), a circular ship in diameter, was built in 1871. Equipped with two engines producing a total of 3,360 nominal horsepower, her trials during that summer were considered a success.

==Description==

While under construction, Popov&#x27;s design was modified by the addition of wood and copper sheathing to reduce biofouling, which increased &quot;Novgorod&quot;″s diameter to . She had a maximum draught of and displaced at normal load. Freeboard was only and the deck curved upwards to the gun barbette in the center. The ship had an unarmoured superstructure forward of the barbette that housed some of the crew&#x27;s quarters. Despite initial concerns about her sea-keeping ability, &quot;Novgorod&quot; was a stable gun platform and had an easy roll that rarely exceeded 7–8°. Her bluff hull form meant that she lost speed in heavy weather and, on one occasion in 1877, lost all during a Force eight storm. In some conditions the ship could pitch enough to lift her propellers out of the water. The biggest drawback to her hull shape was that it greatly reduced the rudder&#x27;s ability to turn the ship by masking much of the flow of water so much that it took 40–45 minutes to make a full circle and the ship was almost unsteerable in a severe storm. The solution adopted was to use the engines for steering and leave the rudder fixed, even though this reduced the ship&#x27;s speed. She had a crew of 151 officers and ratings.

The ship had six horizontal compound-expansion steam engines built by the Baird Works, each driving a single propeller, using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers. The engines produced a total of which gave her a speed of around . &quot;Novgorod&quot;″s propulsion machinery proved problematic throughout her life as a result of defective workmanship and poor-quality materials. Her blunt hull form was not conducive to efficient steaming and she proved to be a prodigious consumer of coal as her capacity of only gave her range of at full speed. The ship had ventilation problems throughout her career, despite later fitting a large ventilation cowl over the central hatch of the barbette.
&quot;Novgorod&quot; was armed with two 28 cm L/20 M67. This was a 279 mm (11-inch) calibre rifled muzzle-loading gun that was 20 calibers long. The guns could penetrate 11 inches of armour at a range of ; their shells had a muzzle velocity of . Their rate of fire was very slow, about one round every 10 minutes. The guns were mounted on separate revolving turntables that could be moved independently or locked together. Each turntable took about two or three minutes to rotate 180°. Gunnery trials in November 1874 showed that the locks for the turntables were too weak; so much so that the gun&#x27;s recoil could cause them to rotate, leading to the persistent myth that the whole ship rotated when a gun fired. Reinforcement of the locks solved the problem, but the myth persisted.

===Protection===
The ship had a waterline belt of wrought iron that completely covered the hull and extended from above the waterline to below it. The armour was configured in two strakes, each high. The upper plates were thick and the lower ones . The armour was backed by 9 inches of teak reinforced by interlocking channel irons. The navy considered this backing to be the equivalent of another of armour. &quot;Novgorod&quot; was the first Russian ironclad to place her armament in a barbette mounting. It was high and was built in the same manner as the upper strake of the belt.

The rounded deck was protected by a total of of armour, made up of three layers of plates ranging in thickness from . The lower portion of the funnels and the base of the engine room skylight had armour plates thick.

==Construction and career==
The Treaty of Paris that ended the Crimean War of 1854–56 limited the Imperial Russian Navy to only six corvettes in the Black Sea, so the royal shipyard in Sevastopol was leased to the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company. This meant that any ironclads built for Black Sea service would have to be built in Saint Petersburg, disassembled, and then shipped to a port there for reassembly. The long-dormant facility at Nikolaev was chosen and the navy began ordering machinery and tools from Britain to re-equip the shipyard in 1870, when Russia abrogated those clauses of the treaty.

A temporary slipway was built at the New Admiralty Shipyard in January 1871 and construction of &quot;Novgorod&quot;, named after the city, began on 13 April. Using two shifts to speed construction, her hull was completed by 29 December, when the official keel-laying ceremony was held. Within two weeks it was disassembled, and the first shipment of parts arrived at Nikolaev on 2 April 1872. Reassembly began on a specially-prepared slipway eight days later. As there was no rail line between Saint Petersburg and Nikolaev, the components had to be railed to Odessa, where they were transshipped onto river barges and steamers. The boilers were too large and had to be shipped by freighter from the Baltic Sea to Odessa for transshipment. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of parts and the workforce&#x27;s lack of experience; the ship was finally launched on 2 June 1873, with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in attendance. &quot;Novgorod&quot;″s guns were mounted in September, and she entered service the following year, at a cost of 2,830,000 rubles.

During the winter of 1873–74, a small superstructure was built aft of the barbette and an enclosed wheelhouse was built atop it. In addition, the shape of the forward superstructure was modified so that it overhung the bow, and prominent bridge wings were added. A telescoping boom for a spar torpedo was fitted at the same time. In 1875, the ship made a port visit to Taganrog, and hosted Sir Edward Reed during a cruise along the Crimean coast that October. During the Russo-Turkish War, she was assigned to the defense of Odessa, and her armament was reinforced by a pair of 4-pounder guns mounted on her aft superstructure to protect her against torpedo boats. These guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of . During this time, the navy realized that the ship&#x27;s outermost engines contributed little to her speed, and with steam capacity insufficient for all of her engines, the outer engines were removed in 1876–77. This reduced &quot;Novgorod&quot;″s total power to and her speed to about .

The ship made a cruise to the Romanian town of Sulina on the Danube after the war, and she received armoured covers for her engine room skylight and the central barbette hatch to protect against plunging fire. In July 1879 she ran aground off Odessa and was damaged. &quot;Novgorod&quot; was stationed in Sevastopol throughout the 1880s and made short cruises every summer. She received the refurbished boilers from &quot;Vice Admiral Popov&quot; after that ship was reboilered in 1883. She was reclassified as a coast-defence ironclad on 13 February 1892, by which time her armament had been augmented by two quick-firing Hotchkiss five-barreled revolving cannon. These guns had a range of and a rate of fire of 32 rounds per minute. By the following year her hull and machinery were in poor condition. The ship was turned over to the Port Authority of Nikolaev for disposal on 1 May 1903 and stricken from the navy list on 3 July, after which she was used as a storeship. &quot;Novgorod&quot; was offered for sale to Bulgaria in 1908, but the offer was not taken up. The ship was sold for scrap in December 1911.

==Myths and reality==

In his book, &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Warships&quot;, naval historian Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But in other respects, they were a dismal failure. They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn out of control and even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.

The design of these ships was very controversial while they were being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that &quot;Novgorod&quot; made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing a time when the ship&#x27;s engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: &quot;The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the &quot;Novgorod&quot; can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed.&quot; It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: &quot;On a trial cruise, they (&quot;Novgorod&quot; and ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo.&quot; The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults – were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.

A detailed review of Russian circular ironclads has been made by Roffey in 1974 with photos and information available at that time.

<text>Sir Robert Edward Jones (born 24 November 1939) is a property investor, author and former politician in New Zealand. 

==Biography==
Jones was born in Lower Hutt on 24 November 1939, the son of Edward L. Jones. He is the older brother of author Lloyd Jones.

Growing up in a Lower Hutt state housing suburb, Jones attended Naenae College from 1953 to 1957. He was one of the 200 foundation pupils, and one of the ten who stayed to the sixth form (most pupils left as soon as they turned 15 to work) where he recalled a brilliant history teacher, Guy Bliss. He went on to attend Victoria University of Wellington, where he earned a blue in boxing, won the New Zealand Universities lightweight boxing title in 1957, and contributed to a boxing column in the university&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Salient&quot;. He remained a fan of boxing and sometimes commented on TV on big matches.

Jones earned his wealth through investments in commercial property via his company Robt. Jones Holdings Ltd, and was worth $550 million according to the 2013 NBR rich list, and $600 million a year later.

Jones formed the short-lived libertarian New Zealand Party in 1983, just before Robert Muldoon&#x27;s snap 1984 election. Jones explicitly stated his disgust that the supposedly pro-free-enterprise New Zealand National Party had implemented socialist policies like price and wage freezes, and a top tax rate of 66%. His party acted as a spoiler, helping to deliver the government to the New Zealand Labour Party. Then the party implemented free market reforms under Finance Minister Roger Douglas (hence Rogernomics). When the election was over, Jones disbanded the party, seeing that Labour had implemented many of his policies. He and Muldoon had a legal feud, where Muldoon unsuccessfully sued Jones for defamation. But Jones had great respect for Muldoon in other areas. Jones even chaired the farewell dinner on the occasion of Muldoon&#x27;s retirement from Parliament.

In the 1984 election Jones stood for the Ohariu seat, held by cabinet minister Hugh Templeton. Templeton distributed a speech to journalists, which included the statement &quot;Mr Jones despises... bureaucrats, civil servants, politicians, women, Jews and professionals...&quot;. Jones successfully sued Templeton for defamation. Templeton conceded the comment Jones despised Jews was untrue, but claimed to have a number of defences such as qualified privilege; all were rejected by the court, which found in Jones&#x27; favour. Templeton v Jones became an important precedent in defamation law.

In 1985, Jones was located by reporters in a helicopter while out fishing in a remote valley in Taupō. Jones, incensed at the intrusion when the helicopter landed on the adjacent bank, famously punched TVNZ reporter Rod Vaughan, with the whole incident recorded on tape. Jones was convicted of four charges of assault and fined $1,000. Jones asked the judge if he could pay $2,000 to do it again.

Jones attempted to remove the Fijian Embassy from one of his properties during the time of the 1987 Fijian coup and succeeded two years later.

In 2015, Jones was removed from an Air New Zealand flight by security staff for failing to follow crew instructions. Jones&#x27; company subsequently bought a jet for Jones and other company executives to use for NZ travel.

In 2018 Jones sued filmmaker Renae Maihi for defamation after she presented a petition to NZ Parliament calling for his knighthood to be revoked. The petition had garnered more than 90,000 signatures but was not accepted for consideration. The petition objected to comments Jones had written for the National Business Review. In one of Jones&#x27; newspaper columns, Jones suggested that the country&#x27;s national holiday Waitangi Day, should be replaced by a Māori Gratitude Day, a suggestion he claimed was satirical. The defamation trial began in February 2020 and was due to last 2 weeks. Ultimately, Jones withdrew the case after five days.

==Honours==
Jones was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1989 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services to business management and the community.

<text>A Time of Changes is a 1971 science fiction novel by American writer Robert Silverberg. It won the Nebula Award for that year, and was also nominated for the 1972 Hugo and Locus Awards.

== Plot introduction ==
The novel is set in a culture where the first person singular is forbidden, and words such as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot; are treated as obscenities or social errors. A powerful new drug enables protagonist Kinnall Darival to attain telepathic contact with others, and this sharing brings him the courage to lead a revolution against his repressive culture.

The novel is presented in the style of an autobiography, written by Kinnall while he awaits impending capture and imprisonment for his cultural crimes.

The theme of &quot;I&quot; being a forbidden word is shared with Ayn Rand&#x27;s 1938 novella &quot;Anthem&quot;. However, Silverberg stated that he did not know of Rand&#x27;s book until after his own was published, and that his aim in depicting such a society was completely different from hers.

== Plot summary ==
Life in Velada Borthan is ruled by the Covenant, of which the most conspicuous trait is the denial of the self. Referring to oneself in the first person is forbidden. A selfbarer is someone who exposes his soul to others and as a result is ostracized.

The protagonist of the story is Kinnall Darival, a prince of the province of Salla, tormented by existential doubts and by his forbidden passion for his bondsister, Halum. (Bond siblings are an important institution of this society; though not biologically related, the incest taboo among them is as strong as among actual siblings). After his brother Stirron becomes Prime Septarch of Salla, Kinnall exiles himself to the neighboring province of Glin to avoid a direct clash with him. Following a more than cold reception in Glin, his monetary savings are sequestered by the Grand Treasurer of Salla, and he is declared an illegal alien, leaving him as a penniless fugitive. He finds a nice man who employs him for a year in a logging camp, but he is eventually recognized as the fugitive prince by a woman from Salla. On the road again, Kinnall takes shelter in Klaek, a miserable village in Glin, with a family of peasants. Longing for news from the &quot;real world&quot;, Kinnall goes to Biumar and is engaged as a seaman on a merchant boat headed to the province of Manneran. Once there, he turns to his bondfather, Segvord, for a job which allows him an honest living in Manneran.

While becoming a powerful bureaucrat in Manneran, Kinnall marries Halum&#x27;s look-alike and cousin Loimel - however, it turns out to be a loveless and unhappy relationship, as Loimel looks like Halum but has a different personality, and she could sense she is being used as a surrogate for somebody else.

Kinnall then meets the Earthman Schweiz with whom he begins to freely discuss his alienation from his own culture. Schweiz tells him about the wonderful drug available in the wild southern country of Sumara Borthan. Finally, both go to a country lodge and share the secret drug, causing their minds to become open to one another and creating a strong connection between them. Kinnall and Schweiz organize a small expedition to Sumara Borthan where they share the drug with the natives in a kind of social magic ritual.

Smuggling a large amount of the drug into Manneran, Kinnall starts to be the apostle of a new selfbaring cult, convincing many people to share the telepathic drug with him. Among them is his bondbrother Noim. Finally, betrayed and revealed, he seeks escape to Noim&#x27;s estate in Salla. There he is visited by his beloved Halum, and they share the drug. She is so disturbed by the experience that she enters the pen of the voracious stormshields, who shred her to pieces. 
This is taken as evidence of drug being dangerous, and of Kinnall being a criminal for spreading it. Kinnall takes his last flight to the Burnt Lowlands where he ultimately is captured by the royal guards.

The book ends ambiguously. One possibility is that though Kinnal himself was executed or imprisoned for life, what he started developed into a widespread movement or cult, of which the book itself is in effect the Scriptures or basic document, and which eventually succeeded in overthrowing the established order. The other possibility is that all this was nothing more than a hallucination which Kinnal experienced under the influence of his drug, and that what he started ended with him. Both possibilities are left open—which evidently was Silverberg&#x27;s deliberate intention.

==Characters, places and concepts==
===Characters===
*Kinnall Darival - A prince of Salla, second son of the septarch. Tall and muscularly sportive.
*Stirron - Older brother of Kinnall. A hulk like his brother. Eventually becomes septarch of the province of Salla.
*The septarch - Father of Stirron and Kinnall. A man of slender body and modest height. Killed by a hornfowl - a large bird of prey - which caused Stirron to become the new septarch.
*Noim Condorit - Kinnall&#x27;s bondbrother. Son of Luinn Condorit from the northern frontier of Salla.
*Halum Helalam - Kinnall&#x27;s bondsister and his forbidden love interest. Daughter of Segvord Helalam from Manneran.
*Schweiz - An earthman. A merchant who develops a strong relationship with Kinnall.
===Concepts===
*Bonding - A personal alliance between individuals arranged by the families since early childhood. These bond-kin are intended to become very close friends.
*Drainers - Throughout the story, Kinnall seeks relief in the drainers - much like Catholic confessors. The drainers are supposed to keep these revelations secret; however, at least one eventually uses the information he learns for political revenge.
===Places===
*Planet Borthan - An Earth colony orbiting around a golden-green sun. There are five continents: Velada Borthan, Sumara Borthan, Umbis, Dabis and Tibis.
*Burnt Lowlands - Arid place in the middle of Velada Borthan, flanked by two immense mountain ranges: the Huishtors in the east and the Threishtors in the west.
*Velada Borthan - &quot;The Northern World&quot;. Most important continent and home of the first-world human civilization. Divided into eastern and western portions by the Burnt Lowlands. Western portion is divided into nine unnamed provinces. The eastern portion has four provinces: Salla, Glin, Manneran and Krell.
*Sumara Borthan - &quot;The Southern World&quot;. In the early days of the planet&#x27;s settlement, those who defied the Covenant were exiled to this southern continent, covered largely by a tropical jungle. Their society has devolved to a more or less primitive state, based around the ritual use of the selfbaring drug. Though not explicitly stated, the name may in some ways be derived from Sumatra.
*Salla - A province of Velada Borthan. The capital, Salla City, is the home of Kinnall and Stirron.
*Glain - Capital of the Glin province. Ugly, miserable, dismal. The folk of Glain are described as having dark clothes, dark frowns, dark souls, closed and shrunken hearts.
*Biumar - Glin&#x27;s main seaport and second most populous city. A greasy gray sprawl of an oversized town, backed up against a gray and menacing ocean.
*Manneran Province - Province favored by the gods. The air is mild and sweet, filled all the year through with the fragrance of flowers.
*Manneran - Prosperous, hot and beautiful capital city of Manneran Province. Its site is the finest natural harbor in all Velada Borthan. Manneran has established itself as the holy of the holies with the famous Stone Chapel, and a powerful center of commerce.

<text>The pasture day moth (Apina callisto) is a species in the moth family Noctuidae which is active during the day, as its common name implies, making it unlike most other noctuid species. It is found in most southern areas of Australia, ranging from lower Queensland to Tasmania. The species was first described by George French Angas in 1847. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Apina, erected by Francis Walker in 1855.

The pasture day moth lays its eggs in pastures, and they hatch after heavy rains in early spring. When the larvae are fully grown, measuring about , they burrow down before becoming pupae. They have striking coloration; two yellow stripes run down their mottled-black back, interspersed with blue spots. Their bodies are covered with white spines. They feed on various broad leaved plants (see list below).

The adult moth&#x27;s wings are black with cream and chestnut markings, with a wingspan of approximately . Its thorax is black and the abdomen is orange, ringed with black.

<doc id="957301" wikidata="Q573774" url="?curid=957301" title="Battle of Cynwit">
<text>The Battle of Cynwit or Countisbury Hill took place between West Saxons and Vikings in 878. The location of the fortress the battle is named for is not known with certainty but probably was at Countisbury Hill or Wind Hill, near Countisbury, Devon. A possible alternative site for the siege and battle is Cannington Camp in the Parrett estuary near Combwich.

==Prelude==
The Viking army was said to have been led by Ubba, brother of Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan Ragnarsson, and sailed from Dyfed (where they had overwintered) to land on the coast at Countisbury with 23 ships and 1200 men. On landing, the Viking army discovered that the West Saxons had taken refuge in a stronghold at &quot;Cynuit&quot;, possibly Countisbury. According to the 10th century chronicler Æthelweard, the West Saxons were led by Odda, the ealdorman of Devon. The Vikings perceived that the stronghold was unprepared for battle and decided to besiege it, as it did not seem to have any food or water supply.

==Battle==
According to Alfred&#x27;s biographer Asser, the West Saxons burst out of the fortress one day at dawn and were able to overwhelm the Viking forces, killing their leader and over eight hundred of his men. They also captured the fabled &quot;raven banner&quot;. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded: 

==Aftermath==
At the time of the battle, Alfred the Great of Wessex was on the run from the Vikings in the marshes of Somerset. It was therefore an important victory for the West Saxons won by someone other than Alfred, who was then leading English resistance to the Viking invasions. In addressing the year 878, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle claimed that &quot;all but Alfred the King&quot; had been subdued by the Vikings&#x27; Great Heathen Army:
The Battle of Cynwit was one of several triumphant stories recorded by Asser and the Chronicle in 878, ultimately culminating in the English victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Edington.

==In fiction==
The battle appears in &quot;The Marsh King&quot;, a children&#x27;s historical novel by C. Walter Hodges, where its location is called &quot;Kynwit&quot;. Although this novel is about King Alfred, it gives due credit to Ealdorman Odda for this victory, although the description of the battle may not be very accurate, showing the Vikings as making a landing at night and being defeated immediately on the landing ground.

The battle also features in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;. Cornwell ascribes the victory, as well as the killing of Ubba, to his hero Uhtred, though he is supported by forces commanded by Odda.

The battle is featured in BBC&#x27;s and Netflix&#x27;s presentation of &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;. Like the novel that the show is based on, the battle culminates with the show&#x27;s protagonist Uhtred of Bebbanburg slaying the Viking warlord Ubba in a duel, before Odda&#x27;s reinforcements arrive to continue and ultimately win the battle.

<text>Downward to the Earth is a 1970 science fiction novel by American writer Robert Silverberg. It is a tale of the quest for transcendence (a frequent Silverberg theme) set on another planet, and includes references to &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, Joseph Conrad&#x27;s classic tale of colonialism,
including the name of Kurtz. Its title references Ecclesiastes 3:21 in the Bible (&quot;Who knows if the spirit of people rises upward and the spirit of animals goes downward to the earth?&quot;).

&quot;Downward to the Earth&quot; was originally published as a four-part serial publication, starting in the November 1969 edition of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. It was nominated for a Locus Award in 1971.

== Plot summary ==

Edmund Gunderson was the Terran administrator of the colony world of Belzagor, and he returns to it after it has gained independence, feeling a sense of guilt for the way he has treated its dominant species, the elephant-like Nildoror, whose animalistic appearance had kept Gunderson from taking them seriously as sentient beings. On his return, he feels a new sense of kinship with the natives, perhaps more than for the Terran tourists. The Nildoror undergo a process of rebirth, and Gunderson&#x27;s greatest guilt comes from having denied rebirth to seven Nildoror to make them help him repair flood damage. He encounters his old colleague Jeff Kurtz (an addict of Naggiar venom), who had undergone the rebirth ceremony only to be turned into something monstrous. Nevertheless, Gunderson dares to subject himself to the rebirth ceremony, which brings him a new understanding of the native creatures and new powers by which he can heal Kurtz and impart his new-found knowledge to others.

<text>Society for the Protection of Unborn Children is an anti-abortion organisation in the United Kingdom which also opposes assisted suicide and abortifacient birth control.

== History and support ==
SPUC was formed in 1966 amid parliamentary debates over the Abortion Act, which came into law one year later. Although it is not officially faith-based, SPUC and the more conservative anti-abortion charity Life mainly draw upon Catholic and evangelical Protestant support.

Between 2020 and 2022 the group received over £72,000 from US donors who used an agency to disguise their identity.

==Resignation of Bowman==
SPUC founder Phyllis Bowman resigned from her post in July 1999, with nearly half of the 12-person national executive resigning in sympathy. This was believed to be because of a rift with SPUC national director John Smeaton over the organisation&#x27;s strategies.

The Pro-Life All-Party Parliamentary Group, headed by the then-Shadow Home Secretary, Ann Widdecombe, met with SPUC to discuss concerns that following Bowman&#x27;s resignation, the organisation may divert resources from the political arena and seek greater realignment with the Catholic Church, alienating Protestant, Muslim and atheist supporters of SPUC.

==Tony Nicklinson right-to-die case==
SPUC opposed locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson&#x27;s legal battle for a right to assisted death.

==Marriage==
SPUC has opposed same-sex marriage.

On 18 June 2019, the media reported that the organisation did a leaflet drop in Sneinton, Nottingham alongside a letter for parents asking for their child to be withdrawn from Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) lessons. This backfired as some residents in the area condemned the action and, in an interview on BBC Radio Nottingham, the leader of Nottingham City Council confirmed that no letters had been handed in at any school.

<text>Abrud (; ; ) is a town in the north-western part of Alba County, Transylvania, Romania, located on the river Abrud. It administers three villages: Abrud-Sat (&quot;Abrudfalva&quot;), Gura Cornei (&quot;Szarvaspataktorka&quot;) and Soharu (&quot;Szuhár&quot;).

==Population==
At the 2021 census, Abrud had a population of 4,360. According to the census from 2011, the town had a total population of 4,944; of those, 96.66% were ethnic Romanians, 0.86% ethnic Hungarians, and 0.53% ethnic Romani.

==Name==
The name came from the ancient name of the Abrud river. Although first recorded only in 1271 in the form &quot;terra Obruth&quot;, the name of the town might have derived from a hypothetical Dacian word for gold: &quot;obrud&quot;. The Hungarian name is &quot;Abrudbánya&quot; (&quot;bánya&quot; means mine in Hungarian). According to Hungarian linguists, the town&#x27;s modern name reflects a characteristic vowel shift in the medieval Hungarian language which occurred in the 14th century. The Romanian name &quot;Abrud&quot; was borrowed from the Hungarian form, the transformation of &quot;Obruth&quot; to &quot;Abrud&quot; reflects the typically Hungarian vowel shift (from o to a) as in the case of the &quot;Szamos&quot; and &quot;Maros&quot; rivers. If the ancient form had survived directly in the Romanian language, then according to the Romanian linguistic rules it would have produced &quot;Aurud.&quot; According to Romanian linguist Nicolae Drăganu, the earlier form of the Hungarian name was &quot;Obruth&quot; and &quot;Obrudbania&quot; which was a Greek variant of a Thracian word. He states that the Romanian form (a) came from the romanized Dacians, while the Hungarian form (o) came from the Daco-Romans through Slavic mediation.

==History==
===Antiquity===

The Romans erected a small fortification here in the 2nd century AD. It was part of the defence system of the gold mines nearby, in &quot;Alburnus Maior&quot; (nowadays, Roșia Montană), but it was abandoned in the 3rd century.

===Middle Ages===
Abrud was first recorded in 1271 in as &quot;terra Obruth&quot;. It gained town status in 1427.

===18th-century revolts===
In 1727, the leaders of a revolt gained control of the town. Another serfs&#x27; revolt began in the area in 1784 with Horea, Cloșca and Crișan as leaders fighting the Austrian Imperial forces. Abrud was captured by the uprising&#x27;s members on 6 November, before the revolt was crushed by the Austrian army.

===1848 revolution===
During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, negotiations took place in Abrud between the leaders of the Romanian peasants, led by Avram Iancu and Ion Dragoș, the envoy of Lajos Kossuth, deputy of Bihar County in the Parliament of Budapest, regarding the conciliation of the Romanian and Hungarian revolutionary forces. On 6 May, in violation of the negotiated armistice, Major Imre Hatvani conducted a one-way action without any compliance by attacking and occupying Abrud which triggered the Abrud massacre. Hatvani embarked also on unnecessary killings, hanged Romanian lawyer Ioan Buteanu, while his drunken soldiers massacred prefect Petru Dobra. In the next two weeks 88 Romanians were killed in the central square, and around 2,500 Hungarians were killed in revenge by Iancu&#x27;s army in Abrud and in Roșia Montană; Dragoș was also killed, being considered a traitor. The escalated conflict could not be settled, Abrud was conquered and lost several times by the Hungarian troops, until 18 May when they retreated to Arad.

<doc id="957314" wikidata="Q5077278" url="?curid=957314" title="Charles Edward Horsley">
<text>Charles Edward Horsley (16 December 1822 – 28 February 1876), English musician, was the son of William Horsley, and the grandson of John Wall Callcott. Horsley was depicted as the composer Auchester in Elizabeth Sara Sheppard&#x27;s novel &quot;Charles Auchester&quot; (1853).

==Early career==
He received his first musical training from his father and from Ignaz Moscheles. Family friend Felix Mendelssohn advised that he study music in Germany, where his teachers included Moritz Hauptmann in Kassel. There followed three years in Leipzig from 1841, where there was further contact with Mendelssohn and his circle, and where Horsley began composing, including a Symphony in D minor.

On his return to England Horsley established himself as a teacher while continuing to compose. Around 1850, while living in Liverpool, he composed two oratorios for the Philharmonic Society and the anthem &quot;I was glad&quot;. He returned to London in 1853 to become organist of St John the Evangelist, Notting Hill, where he stayed until 1857. In 1856 he was passed over by William Sterndale Bennett for the Cambridge professorship. Bennet subsequently asked him to become a founder member of the Bach Society. In 1860 he was appointed to arrange the music for the 1862 International Exhibition in London, and composed his third oratorio, &quot;Gideon&quot;, for the first Glasgow Festival.

==Australia and America==
In 1861 Horsley emigrated to Australia, where he worked as a choral and orchestral conductor. A string quartet in C major, the manuscript of which is dated March 1861, was completed shortly after his arrival and is probably the first work for this combination to have been written on Australian soil. He was appointed as the organist at Christ Church, South Yarra, but resigned after six months, frustrated by Bishop Perry&#x27;s injunctions against music (Perry being an extreme Evangelical). While there he was commissioned to compose a cantata &quot;Euterpe&quot; to a poem by Henry Kendall, performed for the opening of Melbourne Town Hall in 1876, and also performed at the Crystal Palace in London the same year.

In 1872 Horsley went to America. Three weeks after his arrival he was appointed organist of St John&#x27;s Chapel, New York at a salary of £500 a year, which position he filled to the day of his death. In the United States he wrote sentimental and patriotic songs, which continued to appear until the last year of his life. His wife, Georgina, to carry out his wishes, returned his body to London, placing him to rest near and with his own people in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

==Music==
Horsley&#x27;s music is heavily influenced by Mendelssohn. He initially composed chamber music, including multiple sonatas for flute, violin and cello, trios, string quartets and piano quartets, as well as around 40 piano pieces. But (as with his older contemporaries T.A. Walmisley and Sterndale Bennett) he soon found himself expected to compose choral music. There are three oratorios: &quot;David&quot;, Op.30 (1850), &quot;Joseph&quot;, Op.39 (1853) and &quot;Gideon&quot; (1860), two odes (&quot;Comus&quot;, 1874 and &quot;Euterpe&quot;, 1876), four anthems and various songs. The orchestral works include his Symphony in D, Op.9 (1842-4), a Piano Concerto (1848), and the overtures &quot;Genoveva&quot; (1853) and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1857). The world première of his Violin Concerto, Op. 29, composed in 1849, was performed on October 11, 2016, in Fayetteville, Arkansas by violinist Selim Giray and University of Arkansas Symphony Orchestra under the direction of conductor Robert K. Mueller.

<doc id="957315" wikidata="Q202212" url="?curid=957315" title="Cal Hubbard">
<text>Robert Calvin Hubbard (October 31, 1900 – October 17, 1977) was an American professional football player and Major League Baseball (MLB) umpire. After playing college football at Centenary College and Geneva College, Hubbard played in the National Football League (NFL) between 1927 and 1936 for the New York Giants, Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Pirates, playing the bulk of his career with the Packers. Hubbard is credited as being one of the inventors of the football position of linebacker.

He was also an umpire in the American League (AL) from 1936 to 1951, then worked as an umpire supervisor until 1969. George Halas affectionately called Hubbard the &quot;Big Umpire.&quot;

To date, Hubbard is the only person to be enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Baseball Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life and college==
Cal Hubbard was born in Keytesville, Missouri to parents Robert P. and Sarah &quot;Sallie&quot; (Ford) Hubbard. He grew up in modest means as the son of a small family farmer. Cal graduated from Keytesville High School, but because the school had no football team he also attended one year at Glasgow High School in nearby Glasgow, which did offer football. Already tall and weighing 200 pounds as a 14-year-old, Hubbard displayed natural athletic gifts. He aspired to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York; however a physical discovered he had flat feet, eliminating him from eligibility.

From an early age Hubbard was involved with sports. He umpired pickup baseball games at the age of 18. Hubbard chose to attend a college or university that offered football, selecting Chillicothe Business College in Chillicothe, Missouri while also continuing to work around his family farm. A chance meeting in 1922 with Bo McMillin, the new football coach at Centenary College in Shreveport, Louisiana, led Hubbard to enroll and play football there from 1922 to 1924. Hubbard was the school&#x27;s first All-American. Georgia Tech coach Bill Alexander once watched Centenary when it was in town to play Oglethorpe. &quot;Bo, this Oglethorpe bunch has fast backs, but the line is light and green. If you turn that Hubbard loose, he might kill some of them. Have Cal &#x27;hurt his knee&#x27;, why don&#x27;t you, and let him sit on the bench?&quot;

When McMillin moved on to suburban Pittsburgh&#x27;s Geneva College, Hubbard followed him and played there in 1926 (after a year of ineligibility for switching schools in 1925). Geneva opened the season with an upset of Harvard.

In an era when 6-foot players were considered tall, Hubbard was noted for remarkable speed for a player of his size, listed officially at 6-foot-2, 253 pounds but as high as 6-foot-5 in Packers&#x27; sources. He starred as a tackle and end, playing off the 7-man line in a style similar to that of a modern linebacker. Hubbard completed his college education in 1927, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from Geneva College.

==Professional career==

===Football career===
Hubbard moved on to the National Football League in 1927, signing with the New York Giants for a salary of US$150 per game. Playing alongside Steve Owen his rookie year, he helped the Giants defense allow opponents to score just 20 total points all season as they won the league championship. For his efforts Hubbard won all-league honors by the press the following year. But with a lifelong dislike for big cities, he didn&#x27;t feel comfortable in New York and a 1928 road game in Green Bay led him to request a trade to the Packers, threatening to retire otherwise.

Under Packers coach Curly Lambeau, Hubbard and the team won the NFL title in each of his first three years there (1929–1931). The 1929 team surrendered just 22 points. Lambeau had Hubbard play in the line, ending his &quot;linebacker&quot; days. The NFL named its first official All-League team in 1931 with Cal Hubbard being one of that inaugural list. He was chosen for the honor again in 1932 and 1933. Mel Hein said Hubbard was &quot;probably the greatest tackle I ever played against.&quot;

Once while playing the Chicago Bears with Ukrainian fullback Bronko Nagurski, the Bears prepared to punt. Hubbard went to the halfback Red Grange and said: &quot;I promise not to try to block the kick, Red, but get out of the way so I can get a shot at that Polack.&quot; Grange, glad not to try to block Hubbard for once, obliged. Cal tore through the line, slammed into Nagurski and bounced off. Rising slowly, he turned to Grange and said: &quot;Hey, Red, don&#x27;t do me any more favors.&quot;

Hubbard stepped away from professional football following the 1933 season, taking a job as the line coach at Texas A&amp;M in 1934. However, he was persuaded to return to play after that one year on the sidelines, returning to Green Bay in 1935. The Giants wooed him back to start 1936 with them, but he played only six games the entire season, five for the Giants and a final game for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the future Steelers. Hubbard returned to football coaching briefly, serving as head coach of his alma mater Geneva College in 1941 and 1942. He was among the initial class of inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. In a 1969 poll by the Hall of Fame committee, Hubbard was voted the NFL&#x27;s greatest tackle of all time.

===Baseball career===

Even while Hubbard&#x27;s football career was going full-force, he began to focus on a second career in baseball officiating. From 1928 onward he spent his football off-season umpiring in minor league baseball. By 1936 Hubbard had been called up to the major leagues, umpiring in the American League from 1936 to 1951, a contemporary with the likes of Yogi Berra. Soon recognized as one of the game&#x27;s best officials, he was selected to work in the 1938 World Series, followed by Series appearances in 1942, 1946 and 1949. In addition, he umpired in the All-Star Game in 1939, 1944 and 1949, behind the plate for half of the 1939 and 1944 midsummer classics.

Hubbard found the then-common practice of officials moving to different positions on the field during a game to be confusing and hampered accuracy when making calls. Applying his football experience to baseball, he devised a system where each official had clearly defined duties and also added an additional official to the crew. This was the foundation on which MLB established new officiating standards in 1952.

While he was hunting during the 1951 off-season, a ricocheting pellet from a friend&#x27;s shotgun blast accidentally struck Hubbard in the right eye. The damage was extensive enough to force his retirement from baseball officiating. However, the American League soon hired him as an assistant supervisor for league officiating crews, and in 1954 he became the top supervisor, a position he would hold until retiring for good in 1969.

==Final years==
Never a fan of big cities, Hubbard had moved to Milan, Missouri, in 1944. He left in 1945 but moved back in 1948 for good. Milan was a small town much like his native Keytesville, which is about 50 miles to the south on Missouri Route 5. A lifelong avid fisherman and hunter, the rural areas of Sullivan and neighboring counties offered ample opportunity. Hubbard stayed involved in community affairs, especially children&#x27;s sports, as much as his schedule would allow. In honor of his efforts the football field at Milan High School is named Cal Hubbard Field.

Hubbard developed emphysema in the last few years of his life, so doctors suggested that he move away from the cold weather in Missouri. He relocated in 1976 to St. Petersburg, Florida. In recognition of his contributions to the game as an umpire and supervisor, Cal Hubbard was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in , only the fifth umpire to be so honored up to that time.

Hubbard died due to cancer October 17, 1977, in St. Petersburg. He is buried in the Oakwood Cemetery, Milan, Missouri. He was survived by wife Mildred and two sons, Dr. Robert Hubbard, and William &quot;Bill&quot; Hubbard.

<doc id="957316" wikidata="Q281782" url="?curid=957316" title="Default (computer science)">
<text>A default, in computer science, refers to the preexisting value of a user-configurable setting that is assigned to a software application, computer program or device. Such settings are also called presets or factory presets, especially for electronic devices. 

Default values are standards values that are universal to all instances of the device or model and intended to make the device as accessible as possible &quot;out of the box&quot; without necessitating a lengthy configuration process prior to use. The user only has to modify the default settings according to their personal preferences. In many devices, the user has the option to restore these default settings for one or all options. Such an assignment makes the choice of that setting or value more likely, this is called the default effect.

==Examples==

===Application software preferences===
One use of default parameters is for initial settings for application software. For example, the first time a user runs an application it may suggest that the user&#x27;s delivery address is in the United States. This default might be appropriate if more users of that application were in the US than any other country. If the user selected a new country, it would override the default, and perhaps become the default for the next time the application is used on that computer or by that user. Changing the default for the next run would involve storing user information in some place, such as in cookies on the user&#x27;s computer for an Internet application. In Microsoft Windows, default file associations associate applications with file types.

===Television or computer monitor===
A TV or computer monitor typically comes with a button to &quot;restore factory presets&quot;. This allows the settings for brightness, contrast, color, etc., to be returned to the defaults recommended by the manufacturer. This button may be used when the settings get badly adjusted (say by a toddler playing with the controls). Some &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of the settings may still be needed from the factory settings, but they will likely be closer to the desired settings than random settings.

==In application software==
Using a default involves two goals which sometimes conflict:

*Minimal user interaction should be required. Setting defaults to the most commonly selected options serves this purpose.
*Panel entry errors should be minimized. Using defaults will tend to increase errors, as users may leave incorrect default settings selected. In cases where the value can be verified, this is not a severe problem. For example, the delivery country can be checked against the street address or postal codes and any mismatch can generate an error panel displayed to the user, who will then presumably make the correction.

In cases where there is no clear majority and the results cannot easily be verified by other available information, such as the gender of the individual, no default should be offered. Some software applications, however, require that default values be supplied.

A 1982 Apple Computer manual for developers warned: &quot;Please do not ever use the word default in a program designed for humans. Default is something the mortgage went into right before the evil banker stole the Widow Parson&#x27;s house. There is an exhaustive list of substitutes (previous, automatic, standard, etc.)&quot;.

==In computer languages==
Many languages in the C family (but not C itself, as of C11) allow a function to have &quot;default&quot; parameters or default arguments, that are used if the function is called with omitted parameter specifications.

In C and programming languages based on its syntax, the codice_1 statement (which dispatches among a number of alternatives) can make use of the codice_2 keyword to provide a case for when no other case matches.

In Fortran, the INIT parameter on a declaration defines an initial default value for that variable.

In Rust, types that implement the codice_3 trait can produce a default value. For example, the primitive integer types in Rust implement the codice_3 trait by returning 0.

==In operating systems==
In operating systems using a command line interface, the user types short commands often followed by various parameters and options.

<doc id="957317" wikidata="Q1581696" url="?curid=957317" title="Second Reality">
<text>Second Reality (originally titled Unreal ] [ - The 2nd Reality) is an IBM PC compatible demo created by the Finnish demogroup Future Crew. It debuted at the Assembly 1993 demoparty on July 30, 1993, where it was entered into the PC demo competition, and finished in first place with its demonstration of 2D and 3D computer graphics rendering. The demo was released to the public in October 1993. It is considered to be one of the best demos created during the early 1990s on the PC; in 1999 Slashdot voted it one of the &quot;Top 10 Hacks of All Time&quot;. Its source code was released in a GitHub repository as public domain software using the Unlicense on the 20th anniversary of the release on 1 August 2013.

== Demo description ==
Many techniques used by other demos, including Future Crew&#x27;s own earlier work, were refined and reused in Second Reality. The demo had a soundtrack of Techno music composed by Skaven and Purple Motion using ScreamTracker 3. The degree of synchronization of the visuals with the music was highly impressive for its time.
=== Hidden part ===
The demo can be started with a single character command line argument &quot;2&quot; through &quot;5&quot; to start from any of the later four parts.

For another part that its introductory text calls &quot;just an experiment&quot; start the demo with a command line argument of &quot;u&quot;. The screen will start filling with ever more stars warping towards the screen.

== Technical characteristic ==
In 2013, a reverse engineering analysis of SR with the now-available source code revealed a design which is built around two characteristic demoscene paradigms: teamwork and obfuscation.

Internally, the demo consists of 23 separated parts which allowed independent, parallel development and free selection of programming language (assembly, C and Turbo Pascal) and development tools.

The analysis of the source code also disproved the long-standing and popular speculation that SR uses its own memory manager that accesses the MMU directly; in fact, SR uses standard DOS memory management functions.

=== Running the demo ===
The demo runs best on an Intel 80486 PC with a Gravis Ultrasound or a Sound Blaster Pro (or register-compatible clone). In the original version which was released, the demo had a bug which caused a slow down. A patch was later released to rectify this problem.

While the demo code remains freely available on numerous Internet sites and is now hosted on GitHub, it is difficult or impossible to run Second Reality directly on a modern PC. The demo accesses video and sound hardware directly (using its own built-in device drivers) which is incompatible with modern operating systems, and many of the timings in the demo do not scale up to modern CPU speeds. Therefore, the only way to run the demo on a modern PC with few glitches is by running it under an emulator such as DOSBox. DOSBox is capable of emulating the exotic video modes and the Gravis Ultrasound card preferred by Second Reality, and can be configured to the 33 MHz recommended on the demo&#x27;s configuration screen for optimal viewing.

==Legacy==

=== Later uses of soundtrack ===
* Children of Bodom used the introduction music for the first track of &quot;Ubiquitous Absence Of Remission&quot; when they were known as Inearthed.
* The introduction music was used in the &quot;Tripomatic Remix By Sels &quot;Franky Jones&quot; F.&quot;, of &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; by &quot;Overdog&quot;, released on Bonzai Records in 1996.
* The soundtrack of the demo was licensed for SHMUP, an iOS game.
* This song is featured in the album &quot;Metropolis&quot; (2011) in the tracks 2, 3 and 4.
* The soundtrack of this demo is used in the song &quot;Persian Synthesizer&quot; by Space (2018).

=== Remixes ===
* Second Reality C64 (pouët.net) by Smash Designs – Probably the most well-known and most impressive remix, being a faithful adaptation of the original demo for the Commodore 64 platform.
* Final Reality (pouët.net) by Remedy Entertainment – Although this is a commercial benchmarking software, one of the video scenes pays homage to the original demo&#x27;s &quot;3D spacecraft fly-through&quot; part.
* Real Reality (pouët.net) by N.E.V.E.R. - A remix, which shows all parts of the demo being played in real life.
* Zecond Re@lity (pouët.net) by Zon@ Neutr@ - Also a &quot;real life&quot; remix, however, this one also features the original soundtrack being performed a cappella.
* Flash Reality (pouët.net) by The Scampers – A Macromedia Flash remix, with many scenes recreated using the Actionscript programming language.
* SHizZLE (Team Pokeme) – A demo on the Pokémon Mini, which contains some parts of Second Reality.
* Second Reality 2013 (pouët.net) by Checkpoint – remix for Atari ST
* 8K Reality (pouët.net) by Fulcrum – a remix done in 8 kilobytes of executable PC code. Released at Revision 2015 demoparty where it was ranked second. The two-dimension drawings were modelled using metaballs.
* Rocky Reality (pouët.net) by Bedrock Bros. - a port done for the Pebble Smartwatch. Released at Evoke 2016 demoparty where it was ranked second in the alternative platform category.
* Holo Reality (pouët.net) by Bedrock Bros. - a demake for the Looking Glass holographic display. Released at Demosplash 2018 demoparty where it was ranked first in the category &quot;modern.&quot;
*Second Realipony (pouët.net) by Equestrian Alicoders - remake with characters from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and original music.
*First Reality (pouët.net) by Holo Sapiens - 3d argumented reality.
*Second Reality X16 (pouët.net) by Team FX - an adaptation of the original demo for the Commander X16 platform.

<text>Amichai &quot;Ami&quot; Ayalon (, born 27 June 1945) is an Israeli politician and a former member of the Knesset for the Labor Party. He was previously head of the Shin Bet, Israel&#x27;s secret service, and commander-in-chief of the Navy. He came in second to Ehud Barak in a Labor party leadership election in June 2007, and was appointed a Minister without Portfolio in September 2007. He is one of the recipients of Israel&#x27;s highest decoration, the Medal of Valor.

==Military and security career==

Ayalon served his entire military service in the Israeli Navy. Ayalon enlisted in 1963 and volunteered for the Shayetet 13 navy commando unit. In 1969, he participated in Operation Bulmus 6—the assault on fortified Green Island, Egypt (jointly with Sayeret Matkal). During the operation, he threw a grenade into one of the radar positions, and provided cover for other soldiers in the force. While climbing to the roof, he was hit in the forehead by a ricochet, but continued fighting. He stormed the position from which he was fired upon and injured as a result, killing two Egyptian soldiers and neutralizing the post. After which he continued along with another soldier, and managed to take control of at least two more key positions on the island. While trying to take over the third position, he was injured in the leg by a grenade, kept on fighting, only to be hit by another grenade in the neck and arm. Even so, he continued firing, only reported his injuries when the island was in full control, and was able to evacuate himself into a boat, where he injected himself with morphine. For these actions, Ayalon received the Medal of Valor, Israel&#x27;s highest decoration.

In 1979, Ayalon was appointed commander of Shayetet 13, and was decorated for carrying out a long list of operations without casualties.

Between 1986 and 1988 he was Defence Attache to South Africa. Ayalon, receiving the rank of major general, served as commander of the Israeli Navy from 1992 through 1996.

Following Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s assassination in 1995, Ayalon was appointed head of the Shin Bet (Israel&#x27;s internal security service). Rabin himself suggested the appointment a year before his murder. Ayalon retired in 2000.

==Peace activism==
On 25 June 2003, Ayalon launched, together with Palestinian professor Sari Nusseibeh, a peace initiative called &quot;The People&#x27;s Voice&quot;. The goal of the initiative is to collect as many signatures of Israelis and Palestinians as possible for the peace plan guidelines supporting a two-state solution without the right of return for Palestinian refugees.

On 14 November 2003, Ami Ayalon with three other former heads of the Israeli Security Agency (ISA), Avraham Shalom, Yaakov Peri and Carmi Gillon gave an interview to Yedioth Ahronoth (one of the leading tabloid newspapers in Israel) based on the paper prepared by Ami Ayalon and Sari Nusseibeh. The interview was conducted by Alex Fishman and Sima Kadmon. In that interview, the former Security Chiefs warn of an impending &quot;catastrophe&quot; for Israel and urge the public to rally behind a document created which sets out the principles of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. The blunt language and statements of grave concern are particularly striking because the ISA is the non-political nerve center of Israeli intelligence, and is the agency responsible both for gathering intelligence and for preventing terrorist attacks—including by such controversial means as targeted killings and other preventive measures. While the interview has been widely quoted, rough translations have only appeared on isolated list servers and websites, and the full power of the meeting—called &quot;historic&quot; by its participants—has often been diluted.

Although Ayalon promotes traditional left-wing ideas, he insists he is not a part of the Israeli left, and spurns the Israeli peace camp for its hostility toward the Israeli public and especially toward the settlers. Ayalon managed to outrage many left-wing activists when he said that only Ariel Sharon and the Likud could bring peace.

He took part in the &quot;Mateh HaRov&quot; demonstration in support of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and made a very critical speech against the Israeli peace camp. He said:

We, who protest here, did not succeed in sinking through to the majority of the people. The majority is silent and therefore has no influence. I will tell you why the majority is not here. They are not here because we didn&#x27;t manage to settle in the hearts [Hebrew: להתנחל בלבבות, originally a phrase invented by the settlers] of this true majority, the majority that makes the difference. We didn&#x27;t manage to talk and perhaps we didn&#x27;t even want to. We turned the settlers of Yesha into enemies and in an overbearing manner we banished them to the outskirts. We will only succeed when the grief of the evacuees will overcome the joyous cry of the evacuators. We claimed the desire for peace solely as our own. The majority sits at home and is quiet, although it wants out of Gaza the same as we do. The majority doesn&#x27;t care, and shouldn&#x27;t care, which person signs the accords to end the [Israeli–Palestinian] conflict. In order to get out of Gaza, the majority of the people must not be silent. 

==Political career==
In 2006, Ayalon was elected to the Knesset on the Israeli Labor Party&#x27;s list, but was not given a position in the cabinet when Labor entered a coalition with Kadima.

At the end of May 2007, Ayalon was one of two candidates for the leadership of the Labor Party in the party primaries. In January 2007, public opinion polls showed Ayalon leading the race, followed by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Ophir Pines-Paz. He retained this lead, and just four days before the poll, on 25 May, was four points ahead of his closest rival, Ehud Barak, with 35% to Barak&#x27;s 31%.

However, Ayalon finished second in the 28 May 2007 round of voting with 30.6% to Barak&#x27;s 35.6%, with Amir Peretz trailing in third. With neither Ayalon nor Barak having received 40 percent of the vote, the two faced each other in a runoff on 12 June 2007, which Barak won, receiving 51.3% of the vote.

In September 2007, Ayalon was appointed to the Israeli cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio and later became a member of the security cabinet. He was also appointed chairman of the Knesset State Control Committee, which is responsible for implementing the recommendations outlined in the state comptroller&#x27;s report on the performance of the Home Front Command during the 2006 Lebanon War.

On 16 November 2008, Ayalon announced he would be leaving the Labor Party for the left-wing religious Meimad party. Ultimately he did not join Meimad, and lost his seat in the 2009 elections.

In an interview with Charlie Rose, Ayalon agreed that &quot;contingent occupation&quot;, and the lack of a &quot;two-state solution&quot;, could lead to &quot;a kind of ... apartheid&quot;, by saying, &quot;Totally right. I think that we are heading directly into this destiny.&quot;

In 2012, Ayalon featured in a documentary film &quot;The Gatekeepers&quot; directed by Dror Moreh and discussed the main events of his tenure in the Shin Bet.

Ayalon is a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.

==Personal life==
Amihai (Ami) Ayalon was born in Tiberias, and grew up in kibbutz Ma&#x27;agan. His parents moved to the British Mandatory Palestine in the 1930s. His mother, born in Cluj, Transylvania, Romania, came as a young girl to study in Jerusalem; his father, Yitzhak, emigrated illegally also from Transylvania, Romania, and was one of the founders of Ma&#x27;agan, where he worked until retirement as a carpenter. Ayalon graduated from Bar-Ilan University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1980. In 1992, he received a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. In 2010, he received a Master of Studies in Law from Bar-Ilan University. He is the chairman of the Executive Committee of the maritime policy &amp; strategy research center (HMS). He is married, and the father of three. Ayalon lives in Kerem Maharal, in one of the houses of the ethnically cleansed former Palestinian village Ijzim.

==Interviews==
In 2024, in an interview, Ayalon said: &quot;If I were a Palestinian, I would fight those who occupied my land&quot;. The former head of Shin Bet (Israel&#x27;s secret service) said that &quot;if he were a Palestinian, he would fight with strength against those who took his land&quot;.

Ayalon has emphasized several times in interviews with Arabic and other foreign media: &quot;Israelis cannot blame the Palestinians for their resistance to the occupation, and if I were a Palestinian, I would fight endlessly against those who are looting my land&quot;.

Ayalon, who headed the Shabak &quot;(Shin Bet, Israel&#x27;s secret service)&quot; between 1996 and 2000, explained that in 1948, Israel was established in the occupied Palestinian territories, which displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Israel later occupied more land and always rejected the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

Ayalon also said: &quot;Palestinians have lost their land. Therefore, when they ask me, what would you do if you were a Palestinian? In response, I say: If someone plundered my land, I would fight him without limit.&quot; He continued: &quot;Palestinians consider themselves a single nation, but one of our troubles is that we see them as individuals, some of whom are good and some who are bad.&quot;

According to report of Al Jazeera Mubasher, he said: &quot;&quot;If he were a Palestinian, he would fight a &quot;borderless&quot; battle against those who occupied his land&quot;&quot;.

Ayalon also said in an interview with the Hebrew newspaper Maariv: &quot;They (Palestinians) have lost their land, so when people ask me: What would you do if you were a Palestinian? I say: If a person comes and takes my land, the land of Israel, as a hostage, I will fight him without limits&quot;. Ayalon continued: &quot;We think that if we provide them with ways of livelihood and food for their children, the problem will be solved, but it is not the case. They are willing to kill and be killed, but not for food. They say we need the end of occupation and return of our independence.&quot; &quot;Ayalon&quot; clarified: &quot;They (Palestinians) do not want what we propose. They only care about the formation of a Palestinian state.&quot;

Ayalon, who was a former member of the Knesset, added: &quot;&quot;In 1923, Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky wrote the essay &quot;Iron Wall&quot;. He says the same thing as me. He says: &#x27;We cannot blame Palestinians. Their land has been taken away and they will fight with us&#x27;.&quot;&quot;

Earlier, Ayalon, in response to a question about the situation of Palestinians who are exposed to Israeli attacks, said: &quot;This is the life of people who have dream of freedom but cannot see it. Whether we like it or not. &#x27;We control the lives of millions of people&#x27;.&quot; Ayalon also stressed: &quot;The only way the Israelis will achieve security is when the Palestinians have hope.&quot;

<doc id="957322" wikidata="Q461682" url="?curid=957322" title="The Scorpion King">
<text>The Scorpion King is a 2002 action adventure film directed by Chuck Russell. The film stars Dwayne &#x27;The Rock&#x27; Johnson as the lead, with Steven Brand, Kelly Hu, Grant Heslov, and Michael Clarke Duncan in supporting roles. It is both a prequel and spin-off of &quot;The Mummy&quot; franchise and launched &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; film series. The film was Johnson&#x27;s first lead role. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $180.6 million worldwide against the production budget of $60 million.

The events of &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; take place 5,001 years before the events of &quot;The Mummy&quot; and &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, revealing the origins of Mathayus and his rise to power as the titular Scorpion King. This name is a reference to a historical king of the Protodynastic Period of Egypt, King Scorpion. The film was released on April 19, 2002.

== Plot ==
Before the time of the pyramids, a horde of warriors from the East, led by Memnon, conquers most of the local tribes. No tribe is willing to fight Memnon, as his sorceress Cassandra can foresee any attack. Mathayus, along with his half-brother Jesup and their friend Rama, are the only surviving Akkadians. The trio is hired by King Pheron of the free tribes to kill Cassandra.

The Akkadians sneak into Memnon&#x27;s camp but are ambushed by guards, who were warned by Pheron&#x27;s own son, Takmet, who had already betrayed and killed his father. Rama is killed and Jesup is captured. Mathayus finds Cassandra but spares her life before he is captured. After witnessing his brother&#x27;s execution, Mathayus is buried up to his neck in the desert to be devoured by fire ants. He escapes with help from a fellow prisoner (the horse thief Arpid) and vows to avenge his brother by finishing the job.

Mathayus sneaks into Memnon&#x27;s stronghold, Gomorrah, with the help of a street urchin. Memnon&#x27;s sympathetic court magician, Philos, helps direct Mathayus to the courtyard where Memnon is training. Mathayus&#x27; plan is interrupted, as he has to backtrack and rescue the urchin, and barely escapes Gomorrah. However, he abducts Cassandra along the way.

Memnon sends his warrior, Thorak, and a group of his men to retrieve Cassandra and kill Mathayus with scorpion venom. Mathayus leads his pursuers into a nearby cave during a sandstorm. Mathayus kills Thorak and his men, but Thorak poisons him. 
Cassandra cures Mathayus with her magic, believing that he is the world&#x27;s best chance to kill Memnon and bring about peace. Although unsaid, Cassandra has secretly fallen in love with Mathayus since he had spared her and rescued her from Memnon, having been his prisoner since she was a child.

Mathayus, Arpid, and Cassandra find Philos, who has perfected an explosive powder. However, they are ambushed by the free tribes, who are now under the rule of the Nubian King Balthazar. Mathayus defeats Balthazar in a fight and earns his reluctant respect and sanctuary, but Cassandra gives Mathayus two visions: one where Memnon and his army slaughter the entire rebel camp, and another where Mathayus dies facing Memnon. Mathayus reassures her that he will make his own destiny and the two have sex.

The next morning, Cassandra returns to Memnon to kill him and prevent her visions. Mathayus, with help from Balthazar, Arpid, Philos, and the army of rebels, launches an assault on Memnon&#x27;s stronghold at the same time. Balthazar kills Takmet during the battle, avenging Pheron. The battle continues until a guard shoots Mathayus as predicted by Cassandra. As Memnon is about to claim victory, Cassandra kills the guard while Mathayus retrieves his bow and pulls the arrow from his back. He fires the arrow at the exhausted Memnon, sending him off the roof to his death. Philos and Arpid use the explosive powder to destroy the palace&#x27;s foundation. With the battle over, the remnants of Memnon&#x27;s army bow before Mathayus, who (by their law) is proclaimed the Scorpion King.

In the aftermath, Mathayus and Balthazar share a peaceful farewell as the latter returns to his kingdom. Cassandra warns Mathayus that this period of peace and prosperity is only temporary. Undeterred, Mathayus claims that he will continue to make his own destiny.

== Production ==
The production of &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; began as a spin-off of &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001), centering on the character Mathayus, portrayed by Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson. Recognizing the character&#x27;s popularity, Universal Pictures decided to develop an origin story set in a distinct historical era, aiming to expand &quot;The Mummy&quot; franchise. The film marked Johnson&#x27;s first lead role in a feature film, where he reprised the titular character introduced in &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. Johnson was paid $5.5 million for his performance, setting a record for the highest salary paid to a first-time lead actor, a substantial increase from the $500,000 he earned for his brief role in the preceding film.

==Release==
Produced on a budget of $60 million, the film was positioned as a major action release for Universal Pictures. Recognizing Johnson&#x27;s global popularity as a professional wrestler, the studio adopted an international release strategy, launching the film simultaneously in 11 overseas markets. Johnson&#x27;s established appeal in over 130 countries was a key factor in the production&#x27;s global marketing efforts.

The film was released on April 19, 2002 in the United States and Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.
===Home media===
&quot;The Scorpion King&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on October 1, 2002. It was released on Blu-ray on July 22, 2008, and was one of the first Universal titles released on the format. &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; was released on 4K on June 18, 2019.

===Video games===
The film inspired two video games: &quot;The Scorpion King: Rise of the Akkadian&quot; for the Nintendo GameCube and the PlayStation 2, which was a prequel to the film&#x27;s events, and a sequel, &quot;The Scorpion King: Sword of Osiris&quot;, for the Game Boy Advance, in which Cassandra is abducted by the ruthless sorcerer Menthu and his lackey, the witch Isis (not to be confused with Queen Isis from the film), prompting Mathayus to undergo a quest to uncover the legendary Sword of Osiris to defeat Menthu and Isis and rescue Cassandra.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Scorpion King&quot; grossed $12,553,380 on its opening day and $36,075,875 in total over the weekend, from 3,444 theaters in the United States and Canada for an average of $10,475 per venue, ranking at number one at the US box office. The film had the largest April opening weekend at that time, beating &quot;The Matrix&quot;. This record would only last for a year before being surpassed by &quot;Anger Management&quot; in 2003. Internationally, it grossed $10 million in its first five days from 1,097 screens, and was number one in nine of the 11 territories it opened in, including setting a record non-holiday opening in Singapore with a gross of $591,000. Grosses in the United States and Canada dropped 50 percent in the second weekend, but the film remained at number one, grossing another $18,038,270. Internationally, it expanded to 35 markets and grossed $12 million. The film closed on June 27, 2002, with a total domestic gross of $91,047,077, and an additional $87,752,231 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $178,799,308, against a budget of $60 million, making it a moderate box office success.

===Critical response===

&quot;The Scorpion King&quot; holds a 41% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 137 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Action adventure doesn&#x27;t get much cheesier than &quot;The Scorpion King.&quot;&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 30 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B, on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert, film critic of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing &quot;Here is a movie that embraces its goofiness like a Get Out of Jail Free card. The plot is recycled out of previous recycling jobs, the special effects are bad enough that you can grin at them, and the dialogue sounds like the pre-Pyramidal desert warriors are channeling a Fox sitcom... For its target audience, looking for a few laughs, martial arts and stuff that blows up real good, it will be exactly what they expected. It has high energy, the action never stops, the dialogue knows it&#x27;s funny, and The Rock has the authority to play the role and the fortitude to keep a straight face. I expect him to become a durable action star.&quot;

James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave the film two stars (out of four), saying: &quot;It&#x27;s possible to make an engaging action/adventure picture of this sort, but &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; isn&#x27;t it.&quot;
Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a positive review, saying the film &quot;rouses excitement mostly from stuntwork and [actors&#x27;] agility rather than CGI excess.&quot; Nathan Rabin of The Onion&#x27;s &quot;A.V. Club&quot; gave the film a mildly positive review, calling it &quot;prototypical summer-movie fare, designed to be consumed, enjoyed, and forgotten all at once.&quot;
Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a score of C+, calling it &quot;plodding and obvious&quot; but adding that The Rock &quot;holds it together.&quot;
Jonathan Foreman of the &quot;New York Post&quot; gave a negative review, saying that &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; &quot;has none of the qualities—epic sweep, relative originality and heartfelt bloodthirstiness—that made &quot;Conan&quot; so trashily entertaining.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for Best Fantasy Film at the Saturn Awards but lost to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

== Historical accuracy ==
&quot;The Scorpion King&quot; blends historical inspiration with imaginative storytelling, resulting in a fictionalized portrayal of ancient Egypt. While the film draws from mythological and historical elements, it prioritizes adventure and fantasy over historical accuracy.

The character Mathayus, played by Dwayne Johnson, is loosely inspired by King Scorpion, a ruler from ancient Egypt&#x27;s Predynastic Period. King Scorpion is believed to have played a key role in consolidating power in southern Egypt before the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, which marked the beginning of the First Dynastic Period (3150–2613 BCE). Some historians associate King Scorpion with King Narmer, credited with uniting Egypt, though this connection remains speculative. Archaeological findings, such as the Scorpion Tableau discovered at Gebel Tjauti in 1995, provide evidence of King Scorpion&#x27;s existence. The film&#x27;s story of uniting Egypt&#x27;s tribes echoes Narmer&#x27;s historical unification of Upper and Lower Egypt but remains largely fictional, prioritizing myth and adventure.

In the film, Mathayus is depicted as an Akkadian assassin tasked with defeating Memnon, a tyrant attempting to control the fragmented tribes of Egypt. This portrayal significantly diverges from historical accounts of King Scorpion. While the historical figure&#x27;s association with scorpions comes from depictions on artifacts like the Narmer Palette, the film invents a fictional backstory involving scorpion venom to symbolize Mathayus&#x27;s connection to the creature.

Other elements in the film are entirely fictional. Cassandra, a sorceress with prophetic powers, and Memnon, the primary antagonist, have no historical counterparts. While ancient Egyptian rulers are known to have consulted oracles, Cassandra&#x27;s supernatural abilities were created to enhance the film&#x27;s fantasy elements. Similarly, there is no historical evidence of a ruler named Memnon opposing King Scorpion.

Director Chuck Russell acknowledged that the film prioritized visual appeal over historical accuracy. Modern elements, such as bikini waxing for characters, were included to enhance aesthetics, aligning with some ancient Egyptian grooming practices. Egyptians often wore transparent clothing suited to the climate and removed body hair using methods such as plucking, though specific details remain uncertain.

The release of &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; coincided with increased public interest in the historical King Scorpion. This was further fueled by the History Channel documentary &quot;The Real Scorpion King&quot;, which aired in April 2002. A spokesperson for Universal Pictures clarified that the film&#x27;s story was unrelated to the historical King Scorpion or archaeological discoveries.
== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack to &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; was released on March 26, 2002, just before the film. It contains tracks from various bands performing either previously released tracks or their B-sides. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA.&lt;br&gt; The 14-track score for the film, composed by John Debney, was released separately.

==Legacy==
===Prequel and sequels===
Following the film&#x27;s release, there were plans for a sequel with Johnson to return as Mathayus and go up against a new villain, Sargon, but these plans eventually fell through and the project was shelved. A direct-to-video prequel, &quot;The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior&quot;, was released in 2008 with Michael Copon as Mathayus and Randy Couture as Sargon.

A sequel, &quot;The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption&quot;, was released in 2012 with Victor Webster as Mathayus and Billy Zane as the villain, King Talus. The fourth film in the franchise, &quot;The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power&quot;, was released in 2015. Webster reprised his role, while Michael Biehn, Rutger Hauer, Lou Ferrigno, and former WWE wrestler Eve Torres joined the cast. Will Kemp portrayed the villain, Drazen.

A fifth and final film, &quot;Scorpion King: Book of Souls&quot;, was released in 2018. Zach McGowan played Mathayus, while Peter Mensah portrayed the villain, Nebserek.

===Reboot===
In November 2020, a reboot of &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; film series was announced to be in development. Jonathan Herman will serve as screenwriter, with the plot taking place in the modern-day, involving a contemporary adaptation of the Mathayus of Akkad / Scorpion King character. Dwayne Johnson will serve as producer alongside Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia. The project will be a joint-venture production between Universal Pictures and Seven Bucks Productions.

<doc id="957326" wikidata="Q113135" url="?curid=957326" title="Italy national rugby union team">
<text>The Italy national rugby union team represents the Italian Rugby Federation in men&#x27;s international rugby union. The team is known as &quot;gli Azzurri&quot; (the light-blues). Savoy blue is the common colour of the national teams representing Italy, as it is the traditional colour of the royal House of Savoy which reigned over the Kingdom of Italy from 1860 to 1946.

Italy has played international rugby since 1929, and for decades was considered one of the best European teams outside the Five Nations Championship. Since 2000, Italy has competed annually in the Six Nations Championship with England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In 2013, they were holders of the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy which is played annually between Italy and France. Italy is ranked 8th in the world by the IRB as of the 15th of July 2024.

Italian rugby rose to prominence in 2000 when it was added to the Five Nations, creating the Six Nations. Initially on the receiving end of some heavy defeats, the side grew in competitiveness, recording a fourth-place finish in 2007 and 2013, and one-sided defeats became less frequent. The Azzurri showed respectable results when playing at home in the early 2010s: they defeated France 22–21 in the 2011 Six Nations Championship; and during the 2013 Six Nations Championship, they again beat France 23–18, also securing a 13-13 draw in 2024 and defeating Ireland 22–15. Italy has beaten Wales in 2003 Six Nations Championship, 2007 Six Nations Championship, 2022 Six Nations Championship, 2024 Six Nations Championship and 2025 Six Nations Championship, and securing a 18-18 draw in 2006 Six Nations Championship at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.
In 2022 Six Nations Championship Edoardo Padovani scored a last minute try against Wales, to earn Italy their first win in 36 games, as well as their first away win against Wales and third away win in the tournament. Italy has also defeated Scotland in 2000 Six Nations Championship, 2004 Six Nations Championship, 2008 Six Nations Championship, 2010 Six Nations Championship, 2012 Six Nations Championship and 2024 Six Nations Championship at Stadio Olimpico, and in 2007 Six Nations Championship and in 2015 Six Nations Championship at Murrayfield. 
As of 2024 they have defeated at least once each 6 nations team, except England, for now.

Italy have competed at every Rugby World Cup since the first tournament in 1987, where Italy played the inaugural game against New Zealand, but they are yet to progress beyond the first round. The team has developed a reputation for being a consistent middle man at the tournament. Italy&#x27;s results, since the inception of a new group stage formula in 2003, have consistently followed a pattern of two wins against Tier 2 teams and two losses against Tier 1 ones (although in 2019, the match against New Zealand was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis and a draw was awarded as result). The current head coach is Gonzalo Quesada and the captain is currently Michele Lamaro.

== History ==
=== Early history: 1911–34 ===
The first match played by an Italian XV was in 1911 between US Milanese and Voiron of France. On 25 July of the same year the &quot;Propaganda Committee&quot; was formed which in 1928 became the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR) (Italian Rugby Federation).

In May 1929, Italy played their first international losing 0–9 against Spain in Barcelona. In 1934, Italy was one of the founder members of FIRA, today&#x27;s Rugby Europe; the others were France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Catalonia, Romania, Holland and Germany.

=== 1945–85 ===

World War II meant a hiatus for Italian rugby union, as it did in other rugby-playing nations. Post-war, there was a desire to return to normal and Italian rugby union entered a new dimension thanks to the help of Allied troops in Italy.

In the 1970s and 1980s rugby union made enormous progress thanks to great foreign players (John Kirwan, Naas Botha, David Campese, Michael Lynagh) and coaches (Julien Saby, Roy Bish, Greenwood, Nelie Smith) in the Italian championship. Even foreign coaches were and continue to be chosen for the national team, like Bertrande Fourcade and Georges Coste. In 1973, the national team went on a tour of South Africa, coached by ex-Springbok prop Amos Du Plooey. Tours of England and Scotland followed, as well as games against Australia and New Zealand, the masters of their day. In 1978, Italy first played Argentina at Rovigo, winning 19–6.

=== 1986–99 ===

Since the mid-1980s, Italy had been pursuing the ambition of playing in an expanded Five Nations Championship. Consistently winning against nations that now play in the European Nations Cup (Romania, Spain, Georgia, etc.), and good results against the major nations such as France, Scotland, Wales and Ireland meant that they were often talked as strong candidates.

In 1986, Italy hosted an England XV squad in Rome, drawing 15–15. The Azzurri took part in the first-ever Rugby World Cup match against New Zealand on 22 May 1987. The match proved a one-sided affair with New Zealand convincing 70–6 winners against a young Italy side. John Kirwan, later to become the Italy national coach, scored one of the tournament&#x27;s greatest-ever tries for the All Blacks. Italy beat Fiji but lost to Argentina and finished third in their pool, failing to make the finals. In 1988, they played Ireland for the first time.

At the 1991 World Cup, Italy were grouped in a tough pool with the likes of England and the All Blacks. They lost both of these games but beat the USA. Italy first played Wales in 1994. At the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, Italy came close to beating England; losing 20–27, but recovered to beat Argentina. They finished third in their pool again below England and Western Samoa, but above the Argentines.
The late 1990s saw the Italians build a formidable side and record Test victories over Five Nations opposition. In 1996, a deal between British Sky Broadcasting and the Rugby Football Union meant that England home games were exclusively shown on Sky. England were threatened with being expelled from the Five Nations to be replaced by Italy. This threat was never carried out as a deal was worked out.

In 1996, Italy toured England, Wales and for the first time Scotland, losing all matches. The team recorded two consecutive victories over Ireland in 1997; 37–29 on 4 January, at Lansdowne Road, and 37–22 on 20 December, in Bologna. On 22 March 1997 they recorded their first win over France, 40–32, (in Grenoble). In January 1998, Scotland were the victims with Italy winning 25–21 (in Treviso); in the same year in the Rugby World Cup Qualifiers, they narrowly lost 15–23 against England at Huddersfield, but they argued for a try by Alessandro Troncon disallowed by the referee.

At the 1999 World Cup, Italy were drawn with New Zealand for the third time and lost again. They did not win a single pool match and went home before the knock-out stage.

=== Six Nations era: 2000–present ===

Italy finally joined the Six Nations Championship in 2000 but their admission coincided with the departure of some of their best players. Nevertheless, they won their opening game against the reigning champions Scotland 34–20. Thereafter they struggled to compete against the other nations and their participation was called into question. The 2001 and 2002 tournaments were particularly disappointing as they did not win a single game. Coach Brad Johnstone was sacked in 2002 after an alleged show of &#x27;player power&#x27;.

John Kirwan was then appointed coach. They managed to win their second Six Nations game in 2003, a 30–22 victory over Wales, thus avoiding the wooden spoon. They followed up by winning two games at the World Cup, another first. The tournament was, however, ultimately disappointing as the Welsh gained revenge with a 27–15 success. This, coupled with defeat against New Zealand, that meant that Italy were the only Six Nations country not to advance to the knock-out stage. Their third Six Nations win came against Scotland in 2004.

Italy, along with other nations, had made good use of IRB rules which allowed them to select foreign-born players if they had Italian ancestry or had lived in Italy for a qualifying period of three years. From 2004 they announced that they would only pick three such &#x27;non-Italians&#x27; per team in order to develop their own domestic players.

In the 2005 Six Nations Italy finished bottom of the table again and failed to win a single game. Kirwan was sacked and replaced with Pierre Berbizier. Italy then went on a tour of Argentina where they surprised many by beating the Pumas 30–29 and drawing the series 1–1 (the only 2005 victory of a Northern Hemisphere team visiting a Southern Hemisphere team). However, the Pumas had their revenge when they visited Genoa and beat Italy 39–22.
In the 2006 Six Nations Championship Italy performed strongly against every team, leading against both England and France in the first half, but lost their first three games. They did, however, get a creditable 18–18 draw away to Wales, their first away point in the tournament, and were unlucky not to draw with Scotland in Rome in the final game, losing 10–13 courtesy of a late Scottish penalty.

In the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Italy started poorly, losing to France 3–39. However, Italy&#x27;s performance improved, and they held England to a 20–7 result at Twickenham. Italy followed with a stunning start to their match at Murrayfield against Scotland, scoring three quick tries to give Italy a 21–0 lead after seven minutes, and the &quot;Azzurri&quot; went on to a 37–17 victory; their first-ever away win in the Six Nations. Italy&#x27;s next match was against Wales in Rome, with Italy winning 23–20, for their first consecutive victories in the competition and help them achieve their highest-ever position in the competition. The domestic interest in rugby reached new heights with Italy&#x27;s new success front page media coverage and the sport being held up as a model of fair play. Media and public interest in the national team was very high during the side&#x27;s newfound success and on the final day a win could have seen them win their first ever six nations tournament. They needed a large win over ireland and other results to go their way. Italy were only 1 point behind at half time before they fell away in the 2nd half eventually losing 24-43. Despite losing their last game 10,000 fans later greeted the national team at Rome&#x27;s Piazza del Popolo.

The 2008 Six Nations Championship saw Italy again finish in last place, albeit by only a three-point margin. They took part in close matches against Ireland, Wales England and France respectively and managed a sole victory, defeating Scotland 23–20 in Rome in the last round of matches. In the summer tests they lost to South Africa but again managed to surprise 3rd ranked Argentina with a 13–12 victory. At the 2008 end of year tour Italy pushed the Wallabies in their clash in Padova, but the Australians eventually went on to win 30–20. A week later Italy were defeated by Argentina, 14–22.

Italy&#x27;s 2009 Six Nations campaign was ill-fated almost from the beginning, with both scrum-halves ruled out of the competition before a ball was kicked, and a third alternative ruled out of the opener at England due to injury. Head coach Nick Mallett tried flanker Mauro Bergamasco at scrum-half. Mallett&#x27;s gamble failed in epic fashion, with Bergamasco&#x27;s mistakes leading to three England tries before he was replaced at half-time; England went on to win 36–11. In week two Italy also put in a poor performance against Ireland losing 9–38. The two poor performances were followed by another loss to Scotland. The Azzurri were competitive in their 15–20 loss at the Flaminio to a Wales side resting many of its key players for the championship decider against Ireland the next week. Italy finished in last place for the second straight year after losing to France on the final weekend of the tournament.

In the 2010 Six Nations Championship, Italy were well beaten by Ireland 11–29 before narrowly losing to England and defeating Scotland. Italy were defeated in their last two matches against France and Wales.

Italy finished the 2011 Six Nations with a 1–4 record. In the opening match of the 2011 Six Nations, Italy was beaten by Ireland 11–13 at home, with Ireland scoring a drop goal less than two minutes before the final whistle. The Azzurri claimed a 22–21 home victory over the reigning Six Nations champions, France, gaining Italy&#x27;s first win over France in a Six Nations game. At the final whistle, the English language commentator declared it the greatest win in Italian rugby history thus far.

Italy finished the 2012 Six Nations in fifth place with a 1–4 record, following a 13–6 win over Scotland before over 72,000 fans at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Italy&#x27;s 15–19 loss to England was their smallest margin of defeat. The championship also saw Italy lose to Wales, Ireland and France.

Italy played three matches in the 2012 November internationals, losing two and winning one. Italy lost to New Zealand and Australia 19–22, with Italian fly half Luciano Orquera missing a penalty in the last minute which would have secured Italy&#x27;s first draw against Australia. Italy did manage a win in the series, beating Tonga 28–23.

Italy gained their second Six Nations win over France when they beat them 23–18 on their opening match of the 2013 Six Nations Championship. Three defeats by Scotland, Wales and England followed. On their final game of the championship Italy won against Ireland 22–15 for the first time in a Six Nations match in front of 75,000 fans at the Stadio Olimpico. Overall Italy finished fourth, behind Scotland in third on points difference, to make it one of their most successful Six Nations. In November 2013, Italy hosted Australia at Turin for a 20–50 loss, then defeated Fiji 37–31 at Cremona and was defeated by Argentina 14–19 at Rome.

Italy were whitewashed at the 2014 Six Nations Championship, including a 20–21 home loss to Scotland, a 7–46 loss to Ireland and an 11–52 loss to England. In June the team made an Asia-Pacific tour, where they were defeated by Fiji, Japan and Samoa. In November they scored a home win to Samoa, a two-point loss to Argentina and another loss to South Africa.

In the 2015 Six Nations Championship, Italy took a 22–19 away win over Scotland to avoid the wooden spoon, but suffered heavy home losses to France and Wales. At the 2015 Rugby World Cup, they defeated Romania and Canada but lost to Ireland and France, repeating their performance of the previous three editions.

After another poor performance in 2016, losing all their Six Nations matches, Italy hired former Ireland international and Harlequin F.C. coach Conor O&#x27;Shea to coach the team; with him they also hired IRFU developmental director Stephen Aboud to direct youth programs aimed at strengthening the level of rugby in the country. In June, Italy lost to Argentina and won over the United States and Canada. On 19 November, Italy achieved a famous upset victory by defeating South Africa 20–18 which was Italy&#x27;s first win against the Springboks in 13 attempts at Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence. This victory also marked their first win over one of the three big Southern Hemisphere nations (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa).

Italy lost all their matches in the 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Six Nations tournaments.

Finally in their final match of the 2022 Six Nations Championship Italy earned an historic victory over Wales snapping a 36 match losing streak. They scored a try in the 80th minute with the conversion the final act in the match to win by 22–21 at the Principality Stadium on 19 March 2022.

During the autumn tour in November 2022, Italy claimed 2 victories over 3 matches, defeating both Samoa and Australia (28–27), claiming their first ever victory over the Wallabies.

Italy put in a fine performance in the 2024 Six Nations Championship, pulling off a remarkable 13–13 draw away from home against France in round three. Italy narrowly missed out on victory when Paolo Garbisi&#x27;s penalty hit the post after the ball had accidentally fallen off the kicking tee. The following round, Italy beat Scotland 31–29. This was Italy&#x27;s first victory against Scotland in nine years. The 2024 campaign was Italy&#x27;s best performance since the 2013 tournament during which they won two matches, against the French and then the Irish. Italy rounded off their tournament with a victory over Wales (24–21), as they did 2 years ago, and for the first time since 2015 avoided last place at the expense of their victim of the day, who inherited the wooden spoon. The win also represents the Italians&#x27; 4th away victory in the history of the competition, the 2nd time at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium, but above all it gives Gonzalo Quesada&#x27;s men their best result since the integration of Italy 24 years earlier (2 wins and a draw for only 2 defeats).

==Wins against &#x27;tier-one&#x27; teams==
Wins against Tier 1 nations have included:

Furthermore, Italy drew 18–18 with Argentina in Lourdes, France on 22 October 1997, 18–18 with Wales in Cardiff on 11 March 2006, and 13–13 with France in Villeneuve d&#x27;Ascq on 25 February 2024.

== Stadium and attendance ==
Before joining the Six Nations in 2000 Italy did not have a set stadium and played their home matches in various stadiums around Italy. From 2000 to 2011 Italy played all of their home Six Nations matches at the Stadio Flaminio in Rome. The Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) announced, in January 2010, that the stadium would undergo an expansion, that will increase its capacity to 42,000. Continued delays to the start of construction meant that the revamp could not be completed in time for the 2012 Six Nations so all of Italy&#x27;s home Six Nations games were moved to the Stadio Olimpico, also in Rome. The expansion of the Stadio Flaminio was originally promised to be complete by 2014. It was planned that upon completion of the renovation, the team would move back to the Stadio Flaminio, however little was achieved and as of September 2016 the stadium was still in a state of abandoned disrepair. More Italians are attending rugby union games and whereas before most of the fans at the Stadio Flaminio were away fans. Since moving to the Stadio Olimpico attendances have increased by huge numbers. Italy has drawn large crowds since 2008, particularly for Six Nations matches and for matches against New Zealand:


== Strip ==
Italy traditionally plays in blue jerseys, white shorts and blue stockings at home. Its away uniform consists of a uniform with the inverted colours. Both uniforms have on the chest the Scudetto, even if until the 1990s the non-test Italian teams had the coat of arms of the Maritime republics on the jersey.

=== Overall ===

Below is a table of the representative rugby matches played by an Italy national XV at test level up until 23 February 2025.

=== Six Nations ===
Italy entered the International Championship in 2000 when it became the Six Nations, and made a positive start by winning their debut match 34–20 against Scotland. They finished fifth in 2003 above Wales in the final standings, having defeated them 30–22, and were again fifth the following year above Scotland, after beating them 20–14. In 2006, Italy drew with Wales 18–18 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

Italy&#x27;s first three Six Nations match victories, in 2000, 2003, and 2004, had been in front of a home crowd at the Stadio Flaminio in Rome. However, on 24 February 2007, they defeated Scotland 37–17 at Murrayfield for their first away win in the competition. Two weeks later, they defeated Wales for the second time, 23–20 back in Rome. This was the first time that Italy had won two of their five games in the championship, and they finished the 2007 Six Nations Championship in fourth place.

Italy won the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy for the first time in 2011 with a close-fought 22–21 victory over France. Two years later, they lifted the trophy for a second time by defeating France 23–18. Italy also recorded a first Six Nations victory over Ireland in 2013, beating them 22–15, and equalling their best finish of fourth place in the final standings. On 28 February 2015, Italy achieved their second away win against Scotland, a tight 22–19 victory, and after a 36-match losing streak they won in Wales for the first time on 19 March 2022 by 22–21. Italy put in their best performance of the 2024 6 Nations tournament, with 2 wins (31–29 at home against Scotland, to win the Cuttitta Cup, and 24–21 away against Wales) and a draw (13–13 away against France).

, Italy have won 16 Six Nations matches: 8 of these against Scotland, 5 against Wales, two against France and one against Ireland. England is the only team that Italy have yet to beat in the championship.


=== Rugby World Cup ===

Italy have competed at every Rugby World Cup since the competition&#x27;s inception in 1987. Italy finished third in their pool at their first World Cup, defeating Fiji, but not making the finals. They did not make the finals in 1991, grouped in a tough pool with England and the All Blacks. At the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, they finished behind England and Western Samoa, but above Argentina in their pool.

In 1999 they did not make the finals, with their defeats by the All Blacks and Tonga. Italy won two pool games at the 2003 World Cup, defeating both Canada and Tonga, but lost to the All Blacks and Wales.
Italy played the 2007 Rugby World Cup in Pool C, against New Zealand, Scotland, Romania and Portugal (who had been beaten 83–0 by Italy in the qualifiers), with the goal of reaching the quarter finals for the first time. However, in the crucial group match against Scotland, Italy were undone by indiscipline. Chris Paterson kicked all of Scotland&#x27;s points in an 18–16 victory, despite Italy crossing the line for the game&#x27;s only try.

=== European championships ===
Before 2000, Italy was one of the leading European teams outside the Five Nations, along with Romania, and for a while the USSR.

Italy competed in the original European Championships from 1936 to 1938, but World War II meant that the tournament would not resume until 1952. Italy then competed in these tournaments from 1952 to 2000. Italy achieved only one victory, the 1995–97 FIRA Trophy.

<text>Said ( ), also spelled Saeid, Said, Saïd, Sid, Saeed, Saed, Saied, Sayeed or Sayid, is a male Arabic given name which means &quot;blessed (in Quranic Classical Arabic), good luck, joy&quot; or &quot;happy, patient&quot;. The name stems from the Arabic verb &quot;sa‘ada&quot; (سَعَدَ – &#x27;to be happy, fortunate or lucky&#x27;).

The lesser uncommon form of the name Said is &quot;Suid (سُعِيد &quot;suīd&quot;)&quot; and the feminine form of the name is Saida (Sa&#x27;idah, سَعِيدة &quot;saīdah&quot;) or Suida (Su&#x27;idah, سُعِيدة &quot;suīdah&quot;). Said is another variant from the Arabic given name Saad.

The written form of the name in Turkish is Sait and in Bosnian is Seid. Said or Sid is the spelling used in most Latin languages.

==In Christendom==
The Maltese surname &quot;Saïd&quot; has the same origin but has been borne by Latin Catholics for over seven centuries. Most Maltese surnames are of Italian origin, but this (with &quot;Abdilla&quot;) is one of the very few authentically Arabic given names that have survived in the islands as family names. It is a variant of the medieval Sicilian Christian surname &quot;Saido&quot; or &quot;Saito&quot; (&quot;Saidu&quot;), which was derived from the Siculo-Arabic given name &quot;Sa&#x27;īd&quot; used by both Muslims and Christians. In Sicily and Malta, this surname was sometimes Italianized as &quot;(De) Felice&quot;. 

The surname was established in Malta by 1419, appearing mostly as &quot;Sayd&quot; in the militia list of that year. In the 1480 militia list it is spelt mostly &quot;Said&quot;, but was later variously written &quot;Said&quot;, &quot;Sayd&quot;, &quot;Sajt&quot;, &quot;Sait&quot; in the Catholic church census of 1687. The anachronistic and undocumented claim that &#x27;Nicolò Sayd&#x27;, a grandson of Cem (1459–1496, the renegade son of Turkish Sultan Mehmet II) settled in Malta and became the ancestor of all Maltese bearing the surname &quot;Said&quot; is a fantasy inspired by the writings of historical novelists Maurice Caron and John Freely and recently promoted by amateur genealogists.

Today, francophone countries use transliterations of that name. These include the name Seydou, which is common in West Africa.

<text>Moritz Hauptmann (13 October 1792, Dresden – 3 January 1868, Leipzig), was a German music theorist, teacher and composer. His principal theoretical work is the 1853 &quot;Die Natur der Harmonie und der Metrik&quot; explores numerous topics, particular the philosophy of music.

==Biography==
Hauptmann was born in Dresden, and studied violin under Scholz, piano under Franz Lauska, composition under Grosse and Francesco Morlacchi (who was a rival in Dresden of Carl Maria von Weber). He completed his education as a violinist and composer under Louis Spohr, and until 1821 held various appointments in private families. In addition, he studied mathematics and acoustics.

Hauptmann was initially employed as an architect before finding success as a musician. Notable in his early musical output is a grand tragic opera, &quot;Mathilde.&quot; He joined the orchestra of Kassel in 1822 under Spohr&#x27;s direction. There, he first taught composition and music theory. His pupils included Ferdinand David, Friedrich Burgmüller, Gustav Graben-Hoffmann, Charles Edward Horsley, Friedrich Kiel, Ernst Naumann, Oscar Paul, Isidor Seiss and others.

In 1842, Hauptmann became Thomaskantor in Leipzig (a post once held by Johann Sebastian Bach) as well as professor of music theory at the newly founded conservatoire at the invitation of Felix Mendelssohn. In this capacity, his unique gift as a teacher developed and it was readily acknowledged by his enthusiastic and quite-often distinguished pupils.

==Compositions==
Hauptmann&#x27;s compositions are marked by symmetry and craftsmanship rather than spontaneous invention. His vocal output includes two masses, choral songs for mixed voices (Op. 32, 47) and numerous part songs.

==Literary work==
He was a founding member and editor of the Bach Gesellschaft edition of the complete works of Bach, where he edited the first two volumes of church cantatas and the Lutheran Masses.

His musical philosophy is embodied in his book &quot;Die Natur der Harmonie und der Metrik&quot; (&quot;The Nature of Harmony and Meter&quot;, 1853), in which he attempted a philosophic explanation of musical form. His theory is described as &quot;Hegelian&quot; and he emphasized concepts of unity, opposition, and reunion, which he finds in chords, scales, key relationships, and meter. He conceived of minor and major triads as opposite. This theory influenced &quot;harmonic dualists&quot; including Hugo Riemann. He also advocated just intonation and considered enharmonic progressions unnatural. In this sense, he could be considered a conservative in relation to the compositional trends of his time. He displayed a taste for classical proportion, formal order, metrical clarity, and tonal logic. Unlike the Romantic trends of continuous legato, he considered any &quot;metrical first&quot; (i.e. downbeat – implied or actual) to be automatically accented.

<text>The Mummy Returns is a 2001 American fantasy action-adventure film written and directed by Stephen Sommers. It is the sequel to the 1999 film &quot;The Mummy&quot;, and the second film in &quot;The Mummy&quot; film series starring Brendan Fraser as Rick O&#x27;Connell.

Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, and Patricia Velásquez reprise their roles from the previous film, starring alongside Freddie Boath, Alun Armstrong, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Dwayne Johnson in his film acting debut. Most of the crew from the first film also return, though composer Jerry Goldsmith was replaced by Alan Silvestri. 

The film was released on May 4, 2001 by Universal Pictures. Like its predecessor, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $435 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2001 and the highest-grossing film of the film series. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a 2002 prequel film &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, a spin-off that is set 5,000 years prior and whose eponymous character, played by Johnson was introduced in this film. A sequel starring Fraser and Hannah, &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot;, was released in 2008.

==Plot==

In 3067 B.C., a warrior known as the Scorpion King leads an army to conquer the world. However, they are eventually defeated and he is exiled to the desert of Ahm Shere. Dying, the King vows to give Anubis his soul in return for the power to defeat his enemies. Anubis accepts, conjuring an oasis and golden pyramid, and giving the King an army of jackal-like warriors to conquer Egypt. However, once his task is finished, Anubis claims his soul, and the army is returned to the Underworld.

In 1933 A.D., seven years after the defeat of Imhotep, Rick O&#x27;Connell and his wife, Evelyn, explore ancient ruins with their son, Alex, finding the Bracelet of Anubis. In London, Alex plays with the bracelet, which locks onto his wrist, showing him visions that lead to Ahm Shere. Evelyn is kidnapped by a cult who resurrect Imhotep with the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, wishing to use his power to defeat the King; this would give them command of Anubis&#x27;s army. 

The cult, led by museum curator Baltus Hafez, includes enforcer Lock-Nah and Meela Nais, the physical reincarnation of Imhotep&#x27;s love Anck-su-namun. Rick and Alex set out to rescue Evelyn with the help of her brother Jonathan, who had gotten his hands on a golden scepter, and the Medjai Ardeth Bay, who has returned to help them.

Rick frees Evelyn before she is sacrificed and they fight against Imhotep. Meanwhile, Alex is kidnapped and forced to lead the cult with the bracelet. The O&#x27;Connells pursue them with Rick&#x27;s associate Izzy. En route, Alex secretly leaves clues for his parents, who follow in Izzy&#x27;s dirigible. 

Imhotep uses the &quot;Book&quot; to restore Anck-su-namun&#x27;s soul into Meela&#x27;s body. By doing so, he unwittingly allows Evelyn to unlock the memories of her previous life as Princess Nefertiri, the bracelet&#x27;s keeper.

At the edge of the Oasis, Imhotep realizes that they are being pursued and uses his powers to attack the dirigible. The dirigible eventually crashes into the oasis&#x27;s jungle, and Izzy chooses to stay behind to repair it. The O&#x27;Connells, Ardeth, Alex, and the cult are eventually attacked by pygmy mummies. Rick retrieves Alex while Ardeth kills Lock-Nah. 

They escape from the pygmies, who kill all of the cult members except for Hafez, Imhotep, and Anck-su-namun. Rick and Alex race to the pyramid before the sun light reaches it, saving Alex&#x27;s life and allowing the bracelet to release his hand. Anck-su-namun, Imhotep, and Hafez then arrive and kill Evelyn before entering the pyramid.

Inside the pyramid, Imhotep loses his powers and is forced to face the King as a mortal. Hafez uses the bracelet to conjure Anubis&#x27;s army, which appears in the desert outside of the Oasis. Rick finds Imhotep summoning the King and attacks him. The King, now an enormous scorpion monster, interrupts the fight. Imhotep tricks him into attacking Rick. Outside, Ardeth and the Medjai battle Anubis&#x27;s resurrected army. While Rick and the King fight, Hafez is caught in the melee and dies. 

Meanwhile, Jonathan and Alex steal the &quot;Book&quot; from Anck-su-namun and use it to resurrect Evelyn. Rick discovers hieroglyphs explaining that Jonathan&#x27;s scepter is the mystic Spear of Osiris, the only weapon capable of killing the King. Meanwhile, Evie fights with Anck-su-namun. Aided by Jonathan, Rick gets the spear and uses it to slay the King, sending him and the army of Anubis back into the Underworld.

As the oasis begins to implode and the pyramid crumbles, Rick and Imhotep cling to the ledge of a pit that leads to the underworld. Rick implores Evelyn to escape, but she risks her life to pull him to safety. Seeing this, Imhotep pleads for Anck-su-namun to do the same, but she abandons him. Heartbroken, Imhotep lets go and plummets into the underworld. While fleeing, Anck-su-namun inadvertently falls into a pit of scorpions and dies.

Izzy then arrives with the repaired dirigible and rescues the O&#x27;Connells just before the oasis and the pyramid are destroyed—though not before Jonathan swipes a diamond. They depart into the sunset, with Ardeth saluting them before riding away.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
Following the success of &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999), Universal Pictures quickly moved forward with plans for a sequel. Writer-director Stephen Sommers was approached by Universal after the film&#x27;s opening weekend, and within a day, he began developing ideas for &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. Sommers had already been contemplating a sequel during the production of the original film, aiming to expand the story with a larger scale, enhanced special effects, and fresh adventures for the familiar characters. He wanted to create a new adventure without repeating the same formula, aiming to &quot;outdo&quot; his previous work.

Sommers chose to set &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; in 1933, nine years after the events of the first film. This allowed the characters to evolve, with Rick and Evelyn now married and living comfortably in London. They have a son, Alex, who embodies the best traits of both parents. The story intertwines multiple timelines, exploring the ancient past of the Scorpion King, Imhotep, and the O&#x27;Connells&#x27; present-day life. Sommers also sought to delve deeper into the fascination with ancient Egypt that was central to the original film.

=== Casting ===
Sommers was eager to reunite the original cast, including Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and John Hannah, for the sequel. The returning actors were enthusiastic about the script, which combined elements of horror, visual effects, comedy, and romance. Weisz and Patricia Velasquez trained extensively in ancient Japanese martial arts to portray more physically demanding roles. Freddie Boath accepted the role of the O’Connell’s son Alex after he turned down the part for &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. New to the cast was Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, who played the Scorpion King. Although Johnson was new to acting, Sommers felt his natural charisma was well-suited for the role of a fearsome warrior who made a pact with the god Anubis. Johnson embraced the physical demands of the role, which involved extensive makeup and hours of preparation.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began in the deserts of Morocco, with additional second-unit work filmed in Jordan, including locations like the gorges at Petra. In Morocco, filming took place in Erfoud, which had also been used for &quot;The Mummy&quot;, and Ouarzazate. The production then moved to Shepperton Studios in England, where sets for ancient pyramids and temples were constructed. Filming also took place in various locations around London, including the British Museum and Tower Bridge. Despite challenges posed by the weather, the crew adapted quickly.

=== Visual effects ===
The visual effects team, led by John Berton at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), aimed to surpass the effects of the first film. Advances in computer-generated imagery (CGI) allowed for more intricate and realistic creatures, such as Imhotep. The filmmakers focused on creating a seamless integration between the live-action sequences and CGI, utilizing detailed camera tracking and motion-capture technology.

Berton highlighted the challenge of animating creatures with organic realism and developing characters like Imhotep, whose interactions with other characters were more detailed than in the original film. Arnold Vosloo, who reprised his role as Imhotep, faced the challenge of acting alongside these digital elements, often reacting to creatures and environments that were only added in post-production.

Despite advancements in CGI, the Scorpion King&#x27;s appearance was widely criticized for its awkward facial features and uncanny valley effect. The visual effects team faced challenges due to limited reference material of Dwayne Johnson, as his WWE commitments prevented detailed facial scans. As a result, the digital representation of Johnson lacked accuracy, standing out as one of the film&#x27;s most criticized visual effects, despite improvements in other characters like Imhotep.

== Music ==
The Mummy Returns: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on May 1, 2001 by Decca Records.

The score was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri, who did not reuse any of Goldsmith&#x27;s themes from the first film. It was performed by the Sinfonia of London and orchestrated by William Ross.

The soundtrack contains Silvestri&#x27;s as well as a version of the song &quot;Forever May Not Be Long Enough&quot; by the rock band Live, which slightly differs from the song&#x27;s album version.

A 2-CD expansion was released by Intrada Records in 2018.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; earned $23.4 million on its first day of release, then made $26.8 million the day after. This made it the highest Friday and Saturday grosses, surpassing both &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; respectively. Later that year, those records were simultaneously given to &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. During its opening weekend, the film made $68.1 million, making it the second-highest opening weekend of all time, only behind &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. Moreover, it surpassed &quot;Hannibal&quot; to have the highest opening weekend for a 2001 film, joining &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; to become one of the only four films of that year to make $60 million in their first three days of release. The film also became one of four consecutive Universal films of the year to cross the $40 million in an opening weekend, with the others being &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. Upon opening, the film reached the top of the box office, beating out &quot;Driven&quot;. For its second weekend, it collected a total of $33.7 million, outgrossing &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; in the process. &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; would remain in the number one spot at the box office for a total of two weeks until &quot;Shrek&quot; took it.

The film grossed $202 million in the United States and Canada box offices and $233 million internationally, grossing over $435 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2001.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes holds a 46% rating based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;In &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, the special effects are impressive, but the characters seem secondary to the computer-generated imagery.&quot; On Metacritic it has an average rating of 48 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, who awarded the first film three stars, gave the second film only two, saying that &quot;The mistake of &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; is to abandon the characters, and to use the plot only as a clothesline for special effects and action sequences.&quot; James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two and a half stars (out of four), calling it &quot;hollow, lightweight entertainment—not unpleasant, but far from the summer&#x27;s definitive action/adventure flick.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, praising its &quot;constant plot turns, cheeky sensibility and omnipresent action sequences.&quot; Todd McCarthy of Variety praised &quot;the nonstop action of the final hour&quot;, saying that it &quot;bursts with visual goodies.&quot; Rene Rodriguez of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; said, &quot;Twelve-year-olds weaned on Nintendo may not mind, but anyone who remembers the tactile thrill of an alarmingly real boulder rolling down on &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; will be left cold.&quot;

Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; gave the film a negative review, saying that it &quot;has all of the clank but none of the swank of the previous version.&quot; Charles Taylor of Salon.com was also not impressed, calling &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; &quot;everything the first &quot;Mummy&quot; was fun for not being.&quot;

==Accolades==
==Home media==
&quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; debuted on VHS and DVD on October 2, 2001. It became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the United States, selling 2 million copies after its first week of release, while also surpassing &quot;Gladiator&quot;. The film would briefly hold this record for two weeks until it was taken by &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; when it sold 2.2 million copies during its first week. There are two separate versions of this DVD release either in widescreen or fullscreen formats.

The film was subsequently released on the high-definition Blu-ray format in July 2008, and on UHD Blu-ray in 2017.

==Video games==
Two video games based on the movie were released. The first was released on the Game Boy Color, developed by GameBrains, and was released within the film&#x27;s theatrical release. The other is for the PlayStation 2, developed by Blitz Games and was released in October 2001, to coincide with the film&#x27;s home media release. Both titles were published by Universal Interactive.

== Subsequent works ==

=== Spin-off ===
A spin-off/prequel film centering on Dwayne Johnson&#x27;s character, the Scorpion King, was released on April 19, 2002. It focuses on the King&#x27;s origins, as he rises to power before the events of &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;&#x27; prologue. The film received mixed reviews but was only a moderate commercial success. It spawned &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; film series, with direct-to-video sequels and with different actors playing the title role.

=== Sequel ===
A sequel to &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; was released on August 1, 2008. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah both reprised their roles, while Rachel Weisz was replaced by Maria Bello as Evelyn, and Luke Ford played the now-adult Alex O&#x27;Connell. The film received generally negative reviews, and was the lowest-grossing film of the trilogy.

<text>The RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) is a small, lightweight, infrared homing surface-to-air missile in use by the German, Japanese, Greek, Turkish, South Korean, Saudi Arabian, Egyptian, Mexican, UAE, and United States navies. It was originally intended and used primarily as a point-defense weapon against anti-ship missiles. As its name indicates, RAM rolls as it flies. The missile must roll during flight because the RF tracking system uses a two-antenna interferometer that can measure phase interference of the electromagnetic wave in one plane only. The rolling interferometer permits the antennas to look at all planes of incoming energy. In addition, because the missile rolls, only one pair of steering canards is required. , it is the only U.S. Navy missile to operate in this manner.

The Rolling Airframe Missiles, together with the Mk 49 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) and support equipment, make up the RAM Mk 31 Guided Missile Weapon System (GMWS). The Mk-144 Guided Missile Launcher (GML) unit weighs and stores 21 missiles. The original weapon cannot employ its own sensors prior to firing, so it must be integrated with a ship&#x27;s combat system, which directs the launcher at targets. On U.S. ships, it is integrated with the AN/SWY-2 Ship Defense Surface Missile System (SDSMS) and Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS) Mk 1 or Mk 2-based combat systems. SeaRAM, a launcher variant equipped with independent sensors derived from the Vulcan Phalanx CIWS, is being installed on Littoral Combat Ships and certain s.

==Development==
The RIM-116 was developed by General Dynamics Pomona and Valley Systems divisions under a July 1976 agreement with Denmark and West Germany (the General Dynamics missile business was later acquired by Hughes Aircraft and is today part of Raytheon). Denmark dropped out of the program, but the U.S. Navy joined in as the major partner. The Mk 49 launcher was evaluated on board the destroyer in the late 1980s. The first 30 missiles were built in FY85, and they became operational on 14 November 1992, onboard .
SeaRAM was developed in response to concerns about the performance of gun-based systems against modern supersonic sea-skimming anti-ship missiles. It was designed as a companion self-defense system to Phalanx.

==Service==
The RIM-116 is in service on several American and 30 German warships. All newly laid German Navy warships will be equipped with the RAM, such as the modern s, which mount two RAM launchers per ship. The Greek Navy has equipped the new Super Vita–class fast attack craft with the RAM. South Korea has signed license-production contracts for their navy&#x27;s KDX-II, KDX-III, and s.

===U.S. Navy===
The U.S. Navy plans to purchase a total of about 1,600 RAMs and 115 launchers to equip 74 ships. The missile is currently active aboard s, s, s, s, ships, s, s, and littoral combat ships (LCS).

==Variants==

=== Block 0 ===

The original version of the missile, called &quot;Block 0&quot;, is based on the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile, whose rocket motor, fuze, and warhead are used. Block 0 missiles were designed to initially home in on radiation emitted from a target (such as the active radar of an incoming anti-ship missile), switching to an infrared seeker derived from that of the FIM-92 Stinger missile for terminal guidance. In test firings, the Block 0 missiles achieved hit rates of over 95%.

===Block 1===
The &quot;Block 1&quot; (RIM-116B) is an improved version of the RAM missile that adds an overall infrared-only guidance system that enables it to intercept missiles that are not emitting any radar signals. The Block 0&#x27;s radar homing capabilities have been retained.

===Block 2===
The &quot;Block 2&quot; (RIM-116C) is an upgraded version of the RAM missile aimed at more effectively countering more maneuverable anti-ship missiles through a four-axis independent control actuator system, increased rocket motor capability to 6.25–inch diameter, an improved passive radio frequency seeker and upgraded components of the infrared seeker, and advanced kinematics. On 8 May 2007, the U.S. Navy awarded Raytheon Missile Systems a $105 million development contract. Development was expected to be completed by December 2010. LRIP began in 2012. 

51 missiles were initially ordered. On 22 October 2012, the RAM Block 2 completed its third guided test vehicle flight, firing two missiles in a salvo and directly hitting the target, to verify the system&#x27;s command and control capabilities, kinematic performance, guidance system, and airframe capabilities. Raytheon was scheduled to deliver 25 Block 2 missiles during the program&#x27;s integrated testing phase. The Block 2 RAM was delivered to the U.S. Navy in August 2014, with 502 missiles to be acquired from 2015 to 2019. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the Block 2 RAM was achieved on 15 May 2015.

In early 2018 the U.S. State Department approved the sale of RIM-116 Block II to the Mexican Navy for use on their future Sigma-class design frigates, the first of which was jointly built by Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding and launched in November 2018.

===HAS mode===
In 1998, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the defense departments of Germany and the United States to improve the system so that it could also engage so-called &quot;HAS&quot;, Helicopter, Aircraft, and Surface targets. As developed, the &quot;HAS&quot; upgrade just required software modifications that can be applied to all Block 1 RAM missiles.

===SeaRAM weapon system===

The SeaRAM combines the radar and electro-optical system of the Phalanx CIWS Mk-15 Block 1B (CRDC) with an 11-cell RAM launcher to produce an autonomous system—one which does not need any external information to engage threats. Like the Phalanx, SeaRAM can be fitted to any class of ship. Due to the common mounting, SeaRAM inherits the relatively easy installation characteristics of its gun-based sibling, with Raytheon stating that SeaRAM &quot;fits the exact shipboard installation footprint of the Phalanx, uses the same power and requires minimal shipboard modification&quot;. In 2008, the first SeaRAM system was delivered to be installed on &quot;.&quot; 

, one SeaRAM is fitted to each &quot;Independence&quot;-class vessel. In late 2014, the Navy revealed it had chosen to install the SeaRAM on its Small Surface Combatant LCS follow-on ships. Beginning in November 2015, the Navy will complete installation of a SeaRAM on the first of four s patrolling within the U.S. 6th Fleet. The SeaRAM will equip the Royal Saudi Navy&#x27;s multi-mission surface combat (MMSC) based on the s.

<text>MicroMV is a proprietary videotape format introduced in October 2001 by Sony. It is the smallest videotape format — 70% smaller than MiniDV or about the size of two US quarter coins; it is also smaller than a Digital8 or DV cassette and slightly smaller than an audio microcassette. It was the first helical scan tape system using MR read head introduced to the market. Each cassette can hold up to 60 minutes of video.

==Overview==
The MicroMV format does not use the &quot;DV25&quot; codec used by the highly popular DV &amp; MiniDV videocassette formats. Instead, it uses 12 Mbit/s MPEG-2 compression, like that used for DVDs and HDV. Footage recorded on MicroMV format initially could not be directly edited with mainstream DV editing software such as Adobe Premiere or Apple Final Cut Pro; instead Sony supplied its own video editing software MovieShaker (for Windows PCs only). Later versions of Ulead Video Studio and several freeware applications however could capture and edit from Sony MicroMV Camcorders.

MicroMV was unsuccessful. Sony was the only electronics manufacturer to sell MicroMV cameras. In 2006, Sony stopped offering new MicroMV camcorder models. In November 2015, Sony announced that shipment of MicroMV cassettes would be discontinued in March 2016.

==MicroMV camcorders==

* Sony DCR-IP7 (2001)
* Sony DCR-IP5 (2001)
* Sony DCR-IP45 (2002)
* Sony DCR-IP55 (2002)
* Sony DCR-IP210 (2002)
* Sony DCR-IP220 (2002)
* Sony DCR-IP1 (2003)

NTSC models only can play NTSC recordings, while PAL models can play both PAL and NTSC. PAL models end with an &quot;E&quot; (e.g. DCR-IP7E).

==Software supporting MicroMV==
* MovieShaker—Sony&#x27;s own video editing software originally supplied with MicroMV camcorders.
* Vegas Movie Studio-Supports capturing video from MicroMV camcorders (in HDV mode).
* CapDVHS-Supports capturing video from MicroMV camcorders.

<text>Euro1080 was the first commercial broadcaster in Europe to broadcast full-time high-definition television (HDTV) content. It was founded by Gabriel Fehervari in 2004 and is owned by Alfacam, of which declared bankrupt in 2013.

The name originates from the 1080 lines of vertical resolution in the signal broadcast, which is 1080i50 - 1920 x 1080 at an interlaced frame rate of 50 Hz. The signal uses Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.

The headquarters and studios are located in Belgium at the Eurocam Media Center. The parent company of Euro1080 is the Belgium-based Alfacam Group.

Euro1080 began broadcasting on 1 January 2004 from the Astra 1H satellite at 19.2° east and was free to air during its first few months. Thereafter, a €200 conditional access card was required to watch the flagship channel HD1.

In addition to HD1, whose content is primarily HDTV showcasing for regular users, a second channel was soon created, HD2 focusing on live and recorded HDTV broadcasts of special event for selected theatres. Euro1080 currently broadcasts HD1 and HD3 on the following satellite:

* Eutelsat W3A at 7°E, 10.880 MHz, DVB-S2, QPSK, Symbol rate 13.333 Mbit/s, Vertical, FEC 4/5, MPEG4.

It is also possible to receive it from a growing number of cable operators.

Two channels have been temporarily removed recently:
* HD2 (previously HDevents or Hde): broadcasts premium events in pay-per-view.
* HD5 (timesharing with HD2): promotional channel, broadcasting a six-minute informative video about HDTV and what Euro1080 is, as well a brief glimpse of the previous day&#x27;s footage.

A new channel was launched in 2008:
* HD3: Culture with music. (HD1 then became a sports channel.)

In October 2005, HD1 and HD2 simulcast in both MPEG-4 and MPEG-2. This dual encoding lasted until 2007.

Telenet, the main cable operator in Flanders, confirmed as part of its launch announcement of &quot;Telenet Digital TV&quot; on 16 June 2005 that it would sell HDTV set-top-boxes from June 2006.

Since July 2005, the cable operator Integan has broadcast HDTV in the outskirts of the city of Antwerp, in partnership with Euro1080.

On 1 October 2006 Euro1080 started a new digital culture channel named EXQI. The first target audience was the Flemish and Dutch market, but the channel has expansion plans to more than 10 channels for the major European countries.

On 7 January 2007 Euro1080 switched to MPEG-4 AVC for its satellite broadcasts. MPEG-2 broadcasts for HD1 were switched off on 1 January 2008.

<text>The Caistor Canal was a 4-mile (6.4 km) canal in Lincolnshire, England, constructed between 1793 and 1798. It fell into disuse sometime after 1850 and was legally abandoned in 1936. It ran from the River Ancholme, near South Kelsey toward Caistor through six locks, terminating at Moortown, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) away from its intended terminus at Caistor. Parts of it were dredged in 2010, to aid flood defences in South Kelsey.

==History==

Water transport in the vale of the River Ancholme was improved as a result of work carried out between 1767 and 1769. The Caistor Canal was conceived in July 1792 as a feeder to the river, enabling boats to reach the market town of Caistor, some to the east. An initial meeting was called by a Mr Hall on 3 July 1792, at which it was decided to ask the canal engineer William Jessop to prepare a report. This was considered by the Ancholme Navigation Commissioners in order to assess the risks of flooding caused by the proposal. As they did not oppose the plan, the canal was authorised by an act of Parliament passed on 3 June 1793, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 114), which created the Caistor Canal Navigation Company, with powers to raise £15,000 in £100 shares to construct the canal, and an additional £10,000 by loan if required. The potential for flooding was to be mitigated by routing the local springs into the head of the canal, and Robert Dickinson acted as engineer for the scheme.

There were six locks, which lowered the level of the canal by . The act of Parliament authorised the building of the canal to a point near Caistor where a basin was to be built. Under the Caistor enclosure award, being prepared at the same time, a new road was laid out to the site of the proposed basin, but the basin and canal to it were never constructed. Instead, the canal ended 3.5 miles short at the Brigg to Market Rasen road. An entirely new settlement grew up here called Moortown. The canal opened to that point, probably in 1797/8. It is likely that financial problems were the reason for the shorter canal, as the company borrowed £4,600 from Francis Foljambe, one of the principal promoters of the canal and the major landowner on its route. Income from the tolls was not sufficient even to pay the interest, for there were £574 of arrears on the loan by 1813. The treasurer at the time stated that there was no money available to pay £60 for some work which had recently been completed, and there are no records that the loan was repaid.

Soon after it opened, there were proposals to extend the canal to Market Rasen. In May 1801 the canal company announced their intentions to build a canal from the terminal basin at Moortown to Hambleton Hill in Tealby, on the Market Rasen to North Willingham turnpike road. The squire of Holton, William Dixon, paid for a survey of the route, and estimated that it would cost £6,500 to build. A meeting held at the White Hart Inn in Market Rasen was attended by 26 local gentlemen, and they agreed to proceed with the plans. They agreed to meet again in July, but there is no evidence that they did so, and no further action was taken.

The canal appears to have become disused in the 1850s, a few years after the opening of the Market Rasen branch of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway, which came nearer to Caistor than the canal. However some traffic may have continued to South Kelsey, the village at its midpoint, until later in the century. The South Kesley estate was sold by Mr. Foljombe a few years after the canal opened. The new owner, Mr. Skipworth, and his descendants, were resident owners throughout the nineteenth century. Although the canal company continued to legally exist the canal appears latterly to have been managed as if part of the Skipworth estate, but the nature of the legal arrangement for this, if any, is not recorded. Following the cessation of traffic sometime in the latter half of the nineteenth century, parts of the canal were used for other purposes. Mill Lock, the fourth lock up was used as the site for a watermill, with the wheel occupying the lock chamber. It was built in the 1870s, and was no longer used by 1914. All traces of it have since been removed. The canal became dry above the fifth lock and the stonework of the sixth lock removed entirely before 1883. At some date after all traffic had ceased weirs were built across the locks below South Kelsey. Following the sale of the estate by the Skipworth family in the early years of the twentieth century the canal and its associated drainage system fell entirely out of repair.

In order to restore proper drainage to the surrounding land, the canal was taken over by the Ancholme drainage authority in 1936, after a formal abandonment order, the Caistor Canal Act Revocation Order 1936, had been obtained for the navigation under the Land Drainage Act 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. 44).

The canal was a broad canal, with locks long and wide, and so would have been suitable for the Humber Keels which were used on many of the waterways connected to the Humber.

==Today==

The canal is no longer navigable, and is maintained by the Environment Agency as a main drainage channel. The remains of the lower five lock chambers and the abutments of the tow-path bridge where the River Ancholme towpath crossed the canal are now grade II listed structures. Despite being closed, two narrowboats successfully reached the first lock in 2002.

As a response to the flooding of homes in South Kelsey during the summer of 2007, the Environment Agency dredged part of the canal to return it to its original depth in March 2010. Around of the bed, between the locks either side of South Kelsey village, was affected by the work, which increases the capacity of the watercourse and reduces the risk of future flooding. The channel had been impeded by several sand bars that had developed, and these were removed as part of the project. Environmental consultants assisted with the work, to ensure that the resident population of water voles were not harmed by the operation.

<doc id="957374" wikidata="Q298729" url="?curid=957374" title="Gaius Lucilius">
<text>Gaius Lucilius (180, 168 or 148 BC – 103 BC) was the earliest Roman satirist, of whose writings only fragments remain. A Roman citizen of the equestrian class, he was born at Suessa Aurunca in Campania, and was a member of the Scipionic Circle.

==Problem of his birthdate==

The dates assigned by Jerome for Lucilius&#x27; birth and death are 148 BC and 103 BC. But it is impossible to reconcile the first of these dates with other facts recorded of him, and the date given by Jerome must be due to an error, the true date being about 180 BC. His sister was Lucilia, being the mother of Roman Politician Sextus Pompeius and the paternal grandmother of Roman Triumvir Pompey.

According to Velleius Paterculus, he served under Scipio Aemilianus at the siege of Numantia in 134 BC. Horace notes that he lived on the most intimate terms of friendship with Scipio and Laelius (Satire ii.1), and that he celebrated the exploits and virtues of the former in his satires.

Fragments of those books of his satires which seem to have been first given to the world (XXVI–XXIX) clearly indicate that they were written in the lifetime of Scipio. Some of these bring the poet before us as either corresponding with, or engaged in controversial conversation with, his great friend. 621 Marx, &quot;Percrepa pugnam Popilli, facta Corneli cane&quot; (&quot;Scream about Popillius&#x27; battle, and sing the exploits of Cornelius&quot;) in which the defeat of Marcus Popillius Laenas, in 138 BC, is contrasted with the subsequent success of Scipio, bears the stamp of having been written while the news of the capture of Numantia was still fresh.

It is in the highest degree improbable that Lucilius served in the army at the age of fourteen; it is still more unlikely that he could have been admitted into the familiar intimacy of Scipio and Laelius at that age. It also seems an impossibility that between the ages of fifteen and nineteen—i.e. between 133 BC and 129 BC, the year of Scipio&#x27;s death—he could have come before the world as the author of an entirely new kind of composition, and one which, to be at all successful, demands especially maturity of judgment and experience.

It may further be said that the well-known words of Horace (&quot;Satires&quot;, ii. 1, 33), in which he characterizes the vivid portraiture of his life, character and thoughts, which Lucilius bequeathed to the world, &quot;&quot;quo fit ut omnis Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella Vita senis&quot;,&quot; (&quot;Whereby the whole life of the old (great) man may be laid out as upon a votive tablet&quot;) lose much of their force unless senis is to be taken in its ordinary sense—which it cannot be if Lucilius died at the age of forty-six.

==Life and satire==
Lucilius spent the greater part of his life at Rome and died, according to Jerome, at Naples. He belonged to the equestrian order, a fact indicated by Horace&#x27;s notice of himself as &quot;infra Lucili censum&quot;. Though not himself belonging to any of the great senatorial families, he was in a position to associate with them on equal terms. As an equestrian, he was &quot;one of the few outstanding poets of the period not of lowly birth&quot;. This circumstance contributed to the boldness, originality and thoroughly national character of his literary work. Had he been a semi-Graecus, like Ennius and Pacuvius, or of humble origin, like Plautus, Terence or Accius, he would scarcely have ventured, at a time when the senatorial power was strongly in the ascendant, to revive the role which had proved disastrous to Naevius; nor would he have had the intimate knowledge of the political and social life of his day which fitted him to be its painter. Another circumstance determining the bent of his mind was the character of the time. The origin of Roman political and social satire is to be traced to the same disturbing and disorganizing forces which led to the revolutionary projects and legislation of the Gracchi.

The reputation which Lucilius enjoyed in the best ages of Roman literature is proved by the terms in which Cicero and Horace speak of him. Persius, Juvenal and Quintilian vouch for the admiration with which he was regarded in the first century of the empire. The popularity which he enjoyed in his own time is attested by the fact that at his death, although he had filled none of the offices of state, he received the honour of a public funeral. His chief claim to distinction is his literary originality. He may be called the inventor of poetical satire, as he was the first to impress upon the rude inartistic medley, known to the Romans by the name of &quot;satura&quot;, that character of aggressive and censorious criticism of persons, morals, manners, politics, literature, etc. which the word satire has ever since denoted.

In point of form, the satire of Lucilius owed nothing to the Greeks. It was a legitimate development of an indigenous dramatic entertainment, popular among the Romans before the first introduction of the forms of Greek art among them; also, it seems largely to have employed the form of the familiar epistle. But the style, substance and spirit of his writings were apparently as original as the form. He seems to have commenced his poetical career by ridiculing and parodying the conventional language of epic and tragic poetry, and to have used the language commonly employed in the social intercourse of educated men. Even his frequent use of Greek words, phrases and quotations, reprehended by Horace, was probably taken from the actual practice of men, who found their own speech as yet inadequate to give free expression to the new ideas and impressions which they derived from their first contact with Greek philosophy, rhetoric and poetry.

Further, he not only created a style of his own, but, instead of taking the substance of his writings from Greek poetry, or from a remote past, he treated of the familiar matters of daily life, of the politics, the wars, the administration of justice, the eating and drinking, the money-making and money-spending, the scandals and vices, which made up the public and private life of Rome in the last quarter of the 2nd century BC. This he did in a singularly frank, independent and courageous spirit, with no private ambition to serve, or party cause to advance, but with an honest desire to expose the iniquity or incompetence of the governing body, the sordid aims of the middle class, and the corruption and venality of the city mob. There was nothing of stoical austerity or of rhetorical indignation in the tone in which he treated the vices and follies of his time.

His character and tastes were much more akin to those of Horace than those of either Persius or Juvenal. But he was what Horace was not, a thoroughly good hater; and he lived at a time when the utmost freedom of speech and the most unrestrained indulgence of public and private animosity were the characteristics of men who took a prominent part in affairs. Although Lucilius took no active part in the public life of his time, he regarded it in the spirit of a man of the world and of society, as well as a man of letters. His ideal of public virtue and private worth had been formed by intimate association with the greatest and best of the soldiers and statesmen of an older generation.

The literary remains of Lucilius extend to about eleven hundred, mostly unconnected lines, most of them preserved by late grammarians, as illustrative of peculiar verbal usages. He was, for his time, a voluminous as well as a very discursive writer. He left behind him thirty books of satires, and there is reason to believe that each book, like the books of Horace and Juvenal, was composed of different pieces. The order in which they were known to the grammarians was not that in which they were written. The earliest in order of composition were probably those numbered from xxvi. to xxix., which were written in the trochaic and iambic metres that had been employed by Ennius and Pacuvius in their &quot;Saturae&quot;.

In these he made those criticisms on the older tragic and epic poets of which Horace and other ancient writers speak. In them too he speaks of the Numantine War as recently finished, and of Scipio as still living. Book i., on the other hand, in which the philosopher Carneades, who died in 128, is spoken of as dead, must have been written after the death of Scipio.

Most of the satires of Lucilius were written in hexameters, but, so far as an opinion can be formed from a number of unconnected fragments, he seems to have written the trochaic tetrameter with a smoothness, clearness and simplicity which he never attained in handling the hexameter. The longer fragments produce the impression of great discursiveness and carelessness, but at the same time of considerable force. He appears, in the composition of his various pieces, to have treated everything that occurred to him in the most desultory fashion, sometimes adopting the form of dialogue, sometimes that of an epistle or an imaginary discourse, and often to have spoken in his own name, giving an account of his travels and adventures, or of amusing scenes that he had witnessed, or expressing the results of his private meditation and experiences.

Like Horace he largely illustrated his own observations by personal anecdotes and fables. The fragments clearly show how often Horace has imitated him, not only in expression, but in the form of his satires (see for instance i. 5 and ii. 2), in the topic which he treats of, and the class of social vices and the types of character which he satirizes.

<doc id="957381" wikidata="Q706305" url="?curid=957381" title="Gaius Laelius">
<text>Gaius Laelius was a Roman general and statesman, and a friend of Scipio Africanus, whom he accompanied on his Iberian campaign (210–206 BC; the Roman Hispania, comprising modern Spain and Portugal) and his African campaign (204–202 BC). His command of the Roman fleet in the attack on New Carthage and command of the Roman cavalry at Zama contributed to Scipio&#x27;s victories.

==Background==
According to some Roman historians, including Polybius (Book 10), Laelius was a friend of Scipio from childhood; however, his family background is obscure. This obscurity unfortunately extends to how he became acquainted with Scipio in the first place. Livy suggested that he was not from a rich family, since he wanted command of the campaign against Antiochus the Great in 190 BC to repair (or more likely make) his family fortunes.

Polybius suggests that Laelius was a companion of Scipio from their earliest days in the army together, since Laelius was apparently a witness to Scipio&#x27;s rescue of his father in a skirmish that was probably the Battle of Ticinus in late 218 BC.

Laelius accompanied Scipio on various expeditions from 210 BC to 201 BC but did not begin his political career until after he returned to Rome. This lack of recognition may have been due to his relatively low social status and/or family&#x27;s lack of wealth and political influence. However, given that the name &#x27;Laelius&#x27; only begins to appear with the retelling of the Second Punic War, it may be the case that he (and his family, none of whom are mentioned before this time) is even more lowborn than is assumed.

==Military career: Laelius in Hispania (210–206 BC)==
In the Iberian campaign, lasting from 210 BC to about 206 BC, Laelius was a loyal second-in-command, the only man to whom Scipio confided the entirety of his plans to take Iberia. He commanded the fleet of thirty ships in the assault on Carthago Nova in 209 BC. Laelius was in charge of some important hostages after the capture of New Carthage, and he was dispatched, along with those hostages, by Scipio to Rome in a quinquereme with the news of this important victory. The Senate gave Laelius further orders for Scipio, which Laelius conveyed back to Scipio while the troops were still in their winter quarters at Tarraco. The time was therefore around early 208 BC.

According to Polybius, Laelius then commanded the left wing of the army, attacking Hasdrubal&#x27;s right wing, at the Battle of Baecula (near Bailen) in 208 BC, where Scipio inflicted a defeat on Hasdrubal who then retreated to northern Iberia and Italy. The following year, 207 BC, was spent consolidating their position, though Scipio sent Silanus to deal with the newest Punic commander in Iberia, and had his younger brother, Lucius, capture Orongis (thought to be modern day Jaen). Laelius&#x27; involvement in the events of this year is largely unknown.

Laelius&#x27; role in the decisive Battle of Ilipa (206 BC) is similarly unclear. In its direct aftermath, though, he was dispatched to convince the Berber (or Masaesylian) King Syphax to renew his allegiances to Rome, but failed, owing to the king&#x27;s refusal to ratify any treaty except with Scipio himself; accordingly, Scipio went personally to the Masaesylian court to secure the alliance. Shortly after this diplomatic success, Gades showed discontent with Carthaginian rule, and, catching word of this, Scipio sent Laelius by sea and Marcius by land to capture the city. On the way, the city&#x27;s defectors were apprehended but the squadron on which they were to be deported to Africa was defeated by Laelius at Battle of Carteia. The Romans were then troubled by a rebellion among the soldiers and insurrections among the local tribes in late 206 BC when Scipio fell ill. Laelius&#x27;s role during the insurrection is not clear, but he is noted as having commanded Africanus&#x27; cavalry when the latter marched to subdue the Ilergetean revolt.

==Laelius in Africa (204–202 BC)==
In Scipio&#x27;s consulship year (205 BC), Laelius went with him to his designated province, Sicily, where he conducted an expedition or raid to northern Africa while Scipio was readying his troops and supplies for a full-scale invasion. The purpose of this expedition was to assess the situation in Africa. Both princes having previously been won over, Syphax broke his alliance with Scipio and joined the Carthaginians when he was offered a marriage alliance with Sophonisba, a famous Carthaginian beauty, the daughter of Hasdrubal Gisco. Subsequently, Syphax drove his bride&#x27;s former fiance, Masinissa—who remained loyal to Scipio, having confirmed an alliance with him shortly after the battle of Ilipa—out of his own territories. Masinissa, now effectively a fugitive, came to Laelius during his raid, thought to be in the area of Hippo Regius, to apprise him of his circumstances. Laelius was then able to convey the urgency of the invasion to Scipio.

In about 204 BC, Scipio was ready to invade Africa. After several skirmishes, and a period of contrived truce, the Romans assaulted the allied camp at the battle of Utica in which Scipio and Laelius set fire to the Carthaginian camp. The Romans nevertheless failed to detach Syphax from his marital and political alliance with the Carthaginians; nor was a complete victory possible over the Carthaginian army, with Scipio fearing for his fleet.

Finally, in 203 BC, Laelius defeated Syphax, captured the city of Cirta, and took Syphax alive. He then conducted the captured prince and his son Vermina and some other leading men to Rome.

At Zama (202 BC), Laelius rendered considerable service in command of the cavalry, which was again placed originally on the left wing with Masinissa on the right wing; without the cavalry intervening at a crucial time and falling upon the Carthaginians from the rear, Scipio may well have been defeated. 

==Political career==
Laelius was elected quaestor after Scipio&#x27;s decisive victory in 202 BC. In 197 BC, he was elected plebeian aedile and in 196 BC made praetor of Sicily, both times apparently with the aid of his former commander and old friend. Scipio&#x27;s influence, however, did not serve to win Laelius the consulship in 192 BC. Finally, in 190, he was elected consul along with Scipio&#x27;s younger brother Scipio Asiaticus but failed to win leadership of the campaign against Antiochus III the Great, which would have enriched him. One version has Laelius himself nobly offering the Senate the choice instead of the traditional drawing of lots to decide the allocation of provinces. When his friend Scipio Africanus announced that, if his brother Lucius was chosen to lead the campaign against Antiochus, he would accompany his brother as a legate, the decision was inevitable - Lucius would be preferred. Laelius&#x27;s decision, if this version is correct, was a triumph of friendship, but not for his personal finances.

He was given Gaul as his province, and was employed in organizing the recently conquered territory in Cisalpine Gaul. Placentia and Cremona were repopulated.

==Later life==

Like other superannuated Roman generals, Laelius later served on embassies to King Perseus of Macedon (174-173 BC) and to Transalpine Gaul (170 BC).

Laelius&#x27;s wife is not known, but c. 188 BC, he fathered a legitimate son who would become consul in 140 BC - Gaius Laelius Sapiens. His son&#x27;s relationship with Scipio Aemilianus would, in many ways, mirror Laelius the Elder&#x27;s own friendship with Scipio Africanus, Laelius the Younger fighting in the Third Punic War as Aemilianus&#x27; subordinate, and being his political ally and client as well, as part of the Scipionic Circle.

It was also in 160 BC, when the aged Laelius (probably then in his mid-seventies) met the author Polybius in Rome during his last years, and gave him much first-hand information about Scipio Africanus. Polybius was a client of Scipio&#x27;s brother-in-law Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus (who died suddenly in the same year, 160 BC), and became a friend to both his sons, notably Scipio Aemilianus (Africanus&#x27;s adoptive grandson).

Laelius appears to have died some years after 160 BC, but his year of death is mentioned by neither Livy nor Polybius.

==In popular culture==

As a relatively minor figure in Roman history, media does not portray much of Gaius Laelius. George Handel&#x27;s opera &quot;Scipione&quot;, about the romantic episode &#x27;the Continence of Scipio&#x27;, is one of the few cases. It has Laelius (Italianised to &#x27;Lelio&#x27;) assume, in addition to his historic role as Scipio&#x27;s subordinate, an intermediary role between the Iberian princess Berenice and his friend, along with providing him with his own love interest.

Recently, however, he has had a fairly prominent, albeit largely negative, role in Ross Leckie&#x27;s &quot;Scipio&quot; and a minor role (though comparatively large next to the remainder of the Roman cast) in David Anthony Durham&#x27;s &quot;Pride of Carthage&quot;. A self-published book &quot;Imperator: Italia&quot; by Erich &#x27;B&#x27; Hartmann, presumably part of a trilogy or series, has Laelius as a second narrator charting events of the Second Punic War while he converses (or recollects) with the first narrator, Polybius, who is collecting materials for his eponymous &quot;Histories&quot;.

<doc id="957382" wikidata="Q240510" url="?curid=957382" title="Osing people">
<text>The Osing or Using (Osing: ; ) are sub-ethnic group of Javanese native to easternmost part of the Java island (especially in Banyuwangi), Indonesia. They are the descendants of the people of the ancient Kingdom of Blambangan. The population of Osing people are approximately 400,000 which concentrated in the Banyuwangi Regency of East Java Province.

==Demography==
The Osing people are settled in several districts in the central and northern regions of Banyuwangi Regency especially in Banyuwangi district, Rogojampi district, Sempu district, Glagah district, Singojuruh district, Giri district, Kalipuro district and Songgon district. The Osing community or also commonly known as Laré Osing by some circles and as a result of research, are considered as the natives of Banyuwangi Regency, including an area at the easternmost tip of the Java island that is also known as Blambangan Peninsula. This community of people are spread throughout fertile farming villages in the central and eastern regions of Banyuwangi Regency, administratively includes districts such as Giri, Kabat, Glagah, Belimbing Sari, Rogojampi, Sempu, Singojuruh, Songgon, Cluring, Banyuwangi (city), Genteng and Srono. In the four later districts, integration with non-Osing people occurs usually with migrants from western East Java, Central Java including Jogjakarta; which the Osing people refer them as &quot;Wong Jawa Kulon&quot; (Western Javanese people).

==Language==

The native language of Osing people is the Osing language, it is categorized as part of the Javanese language family. Linguistically speaking, this language has been influenced heavily by its neighbour notably the Standard Javanese (mainly eastern dialects) and Balinese. The main factor is probably due to Osing&#x27;s cultural land which located between the two cultural lands of Javanese and Balinese people.

==History==
The history of the Osing people dates back to the end of the 15th century, at the time of the fall of Majapahit; to resist conversion to Islam, many of them fled east to Banyuwangi, Bali and Lombok. Much of Java were converted to Islam by the Muslim Makassarese in the 16th century. The remaining Hindu princes from Majapahit established the Kingdom of Blambangan, which stretched from the Blambangan peninsula right up to the Tengger mountains of East Java. Blambangan held sway for slightly more than two hundred years before they finally surrendered to the second Mataram Sultanate in 1743, and the eventual Islamization of the Osing people. However, the conversion process wasn&#x27;t complete until the mid-19th century, though small communities of Muslims do pre-exist this date. The cause of the Osing&#x27;s conversion is that, during the 18th century, when Banyuwangi was still unscathed by the Dutch colony, but knowing that by launching an attack on Banyuwangi, they will lose out in the battle as the Hindu principal puputan was a fight-to-death, (as occurred previously in the Puputan Bayu War or Blambangan War in 1771–1773) the Dutch sent Muslim and Christian missionaries to tame the fighting spirit. Only then Banyuwangi was captured, a long and ambitious dream toward further occupation on Bali was launched by the Dutch.

After the Dutch East India Company conquered the region in 1767, the Dutch settled many central Javanese group, Madurese and other Muslim migrants to the area.

==Religion==
The Osings are mostly adherents of Islam, although there are some who still follow Hinduism. Elements of animism can be seen in their religion too. The Osings share a similar culture and spirit with the Balinese. Just like the Balinese people, the Osing people also share the puputan tradition. It is not uncommon to see mosques and puras (Balinese Hindu temples) to be built nearby to each other in Banyuwangi.

==Vocation==
The main profession of the Osing people are farmers with a small number of them are traders and officers in formal areas of employment such as teachers and local government officials.

==Culture==
===Social stratification===
The Osing people differ from the Balinese people in terms of social stratification as the majority of the Osing are Muslims but even the Hindu Osing do not practice the caste system like the Balinese people, even though they are Hindus. This is because of the Islamic influences that is practiced by a significant number of Muslims in their community.
===Art===
The Osing people&#x27;s various art forms are unique and contains mystical elements just like their Balinese and Javanese relatives. The main art form is their popular version of Gandrung traditional dance., Patrol, Seblang, Angklung, Barong dance, Kuntulan, Kendang Kempul, Janger, Jaranan, Jaran Kincak, Angklung Caruk and Jedor.

Other art forms that are still preserved is the nursery rhyme, especially among school children such as &quot;Jamuran&quot; and &quot;Ojo Rame-Rame&quot;. These short poem nursery rhymes in general are used to accompany during children&#x27;s play. Apart from adding a cheerful atmosphere when children are playing in groups, these nursery rhymes can work to teach positive values in early childhood. &quot;Jamuran&quot; nursery rhyme teaches about communal work, while &quot;Ojo Rame-Rame&quot; teaches patriotism.

==Customary village==
The government of Banyuwangi Regency sees great potential in the culture of the Osing people by establishing Kemiren village in Glagah district as a customary village that preserves the cultural values of the Osing people. Kemiren village is also a tourist destination that is popular among the Banyuwangi people and its surrounding communities. Cultural festivals and annual artistic events are often held in the village.

<text>Ian William Rilen (12 August 1947 – 30 October 2006) was an Australian musician. He was bass guitarist and songwriter with rock and roll band Rose Tattoo, and led punk rock group X on guitar and vocals. Rilen was born in Bendigo, Victoria, started his musical career in Sydney and later lived in Melbourne.

Rilen was a member of 1970s progressive blues group Band of Light and other bands, including Space, Blue Aliens, Blackfeather, Sardine v, Hell to Pay, Skindiver and Illustrated Men. Rilen wrote one of Rose Tattoo&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot;, and co-wrote &quot;Stuck on You&quot; with his first wife Stephanie Falconer, which was covered by Hunters &amp; Collectors. Rilen was diagnosed with bladder cancer early in 2006 and died on 30 October, aged 59.

==Biography==
Ian William Rilen was born on 12 August 1947 in Bendigo, Victoria to Jean and William Rilen. He grew up in Torquay and became a surfer.

After various jobs including window dresser, screen printer and sign writer, Rilen turned to a career in music. He played in progressive rock band, Lotus including at the Myponga Festival in January–February 1971. He then joined Space during 1971–1972.

Rilen was bass guitarist for Band of Light during 1972–1974. The progressive blues group formed in Sydney but relocated to Melbourne, and released two albums, &quot;Total Union&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Archer&quot; (1974) (both on WEA Records). They had a No. 18 hit single on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; top 40 with &quot;Destiny Song&quot; in July 1973. &quot;Total Union&quot; peaked at No. 14 on &quot;Go-Set&quot;&#x27;s top 20 albums chart in September. Rilen left in mid-1974 and the band broke up by year&#x27;s end.

During 1975, he teamed with former bandmate, slide guitarist, Norm Roue (ex-Lotus, Band of Light), in the short-lived Blue Aliens with Roy Johnson. Late in 1975, he joined Blackfeather which previously had hits with &quot;Seasons of Change&quot; (No. 15, 1971) and &quot;Boppin&#x27; the Blues&quot; (No. 1, 1972).

===Rose Tattoo===
Rose Tattoo was formed in Sydney in 1976 with Leigh Johnston on rhythm guitar, Tony Lake on lead vocals. and led by Peter Wells, who had just departed as bass guitarist of heavy metal band Buffalo. Drummer Michael Vandersluys completed the line-up. Rilen joined on bass guitar to allow Wells to concentrate on his slide guitar. Rhythm guitarist Mick Cocks soon replaced Johnston; Lake and Vandersluys were substituted by former Buster Brown members Angry Anderson and Dallas &quot;Digger&quot; Royall respectively.

Rose Tattoo&#x27;s hard-rocking sound quickly earned a devoted following in the Sydney area. Members of AC/DC were fans and recommended them to their label, Albert Productions. The band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot; was written by Rilen, who left to form punk rock group, X, prior to its release in October 1977. &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot; was produced by Vanda &amp; Young (ex-The Easybeats, AC/DC&#x27;s producers) and peaked at No. 19 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Cocks switched to bass guitar to cover Rilen&#x27;s departure, then Chris Turner (ex-Buffalo) was brought in.

&quot;I hope I haven&#x27;t done all the things people have told me I&#x27;ve done the night before.&quot; -Ian Rilen 

===X===
Ian Rilen on bass, playing his unique fast down stroke style, formed X with Steve Lucas on guitar and vocals, Ian Krahe on guitar (who used to literally have blood on his hands from his thrashing playing style without a pick, by the end of a show), and Steve Cafiero on drums in the late 1970s.

During X&#x27;s history the lineup changed twice. The first was caused by the death of Ian Krahe, which reduced the band to three members before they recorded their first album &quot;X-Aspirations&quot; (1979) in five hours at Trafalgar Studios in Sydney. The lineup changed a second time on their first Melbourne tour when the band reformed in the early 1980s. The tour was organised by then manager Nick Chance with booking agent Gerard Schlaghecke at Premier Artists in Melbourne, another long time fan of X. Cafiero had always said he would not go to Melbourne; when advised of tour dates, he stuck to his word and would not go, citing family commitments and the fact that his career choice of real estate would be in the balance if he did.

When told by Nick Chance of Cafiero&#x27;s decision not to go, booking agent Gerard suggested drummer Cathy Green, who was based in Canberra. Gerard knew Green was a huge fan of X, and thus knew the songs, and was a great drummer in her own right who could fill in to save the Melbourne tour. Luckily Cathy agreed to do it, on a few days&#x27; notice. There were two hastily organised rehearsals prior to the Melbourne shows, which turned out to be a huge success. Cathy brought a new fresh yet solid feel to the band. Tragically, not long after that, Cafiero died when injected with a dye prior to an X-ray for a back complaint and Cathy became a permanent final member of X.

The &quot;At Home With You&quot; (1985) album recorded in Melbourne, which included new songs inspired in part by Cathy, was made at Richmond Recorders, and engineered by Tony Cohen.

The &quot;X And More&quot; (1989) followed. This, along with its two predecessors, was produced by Lobby Loyde, who was briefly a member of Rose Tattoo in 1979–1980.

===Sardine v===
During X&#x27;s first hiatus (1980–1983), he formed the post punk outfit Sardine v, with his then wife, Stephanie Rilen (née Hancock) on keyboards and lead vocals. According to Rilen, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know [Stephanie] played until I bought a keyboard for the kids and I was writing songs in my room at the house. She just walked by and played a line on the keyboards. I said: &#x27;Do that again&#x27;&quot;.

Sardine v&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1981), was followed by &quot;Sudan&quot; (written by Falconer) which was shown on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; in 1982 with Rilen on guitar, Falconer on keyboards and lead vocals, and Johanna Pigott (ex-XL Capris) on bass guitar. &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, co-written by Rilen and Falconer, was covered by Hunters &amp; Collectors on their 1986 album, &quot;Human Frailty&quot;; Stephanie Rilen later married Doug Falconer from the band.

===Later career===
Rilen reinstated X in 1983, which included drummer Cathy Green from 1984, with whom he later formed a domestic partnership.

During 1984–1985, Rilen also joined with ex-Rose Tattoo members, Cocks, Georgie Leach, Royall and Wells to form Illustrated Man. This was followed in 1990 by The Big Rider (with Green), then Hell to Pay (1991–1993) and a return to X thereafter.

Rilen worked with Ian Moss (Cold Chisel) during recording of &quot;Petrolhead&quot; (1996), playing bass and co-writing songs for the album and later also toured for a short time with Moss.

Rilen rejoined Rose Tattoo in 1998 for the All Hell Breaks Loose Tour with fellow Australian band, The Angels.

Rilen&#x27;s solo album was &quot;Love is Murder&quot; (2001), while &quot;Passion, Boots &amp; Bruises&quot; (2004) is credited to Ian Rilen &amp; the Love Addicts. A second album with the Love Addicts, &quot;The Family from Cuba&quot;, was recorded shortly before his death and released in 2007.

==Death==

Rilen was diagnosed with bladder cancer early in 2006. Rilen was invited to the Jack Awards in 2006, to play in an all-star tribute band for his departed Rose Tattoo bandmate Pete Wells who had died of prostate cancer on 27 March. He left his hospital bed to attend Rose Tattoo&#x27;s ARIA Hall of Fame induction on 16 August. Two tribute concerts were held for him on 5 and 6 October. 

Rilen died at the age of 59 on 30 October 2006. Three other Rose Tattoo members have died of cancer, besides Rilen and Wells: Royall in 1991, Loyde (also producer for X) in 2007, and Cocks in 2009.

==Personal life==
He was married twice, first to Stephanie Falconer and second to Sofia Fitzpatrick. His domestic partners included Cathy Green and Brigitte.

Rilen had five children: Alicia Ann Macfarlane, Jai Jai Rilen, Gentilla, Tallulah (with Falconer) and Romeo (with Brigitte).

<text>Christopher Franklin Boucher (15 February 1943 – 11 December 2022) was an English television screenwriter, script editor and novelist. He is known for his frequent contributions to two genres, science fiction and crime fiction, and worked on the series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, &quot;Shoestring&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot;, and &quot;The Bill&quot;. He also created the series &quot;Star Cops&quot;.

==Early life==
Boucher was born on 15 February 1943 in Maldon, Essex, the only child of Simpson and Alexandra Boucher (née Wheeler). He was educated at Maldon Grammar School. Prior to becoming a television writer, Boucher worked at Calor Gas as a management trainee and gained a Bachelor of Arts in economics at the University of Essex.

==Career==
Boucher began his work in television science fiction for the series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, writing the serials &quot;The Face of Evil&quot;, &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; and &quot;Image of the Fendahl&quot; (all broadcast in 1977). Prior to his death in 2022, he was the last remaining living &quot;Doctor Who&quot; scriptwriter from prior to Season 18 in 1980. One of his contributions to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was the creation of the companion Leela (Louise Jameson), the savage who featured in the series from 1977 to 1978. The character was inspired by the Palestinian terrorist Leila Khaled. Boucher was commissioned for the programme by script editor Robert Holmes, who suggested that Boucher should be appointed in that role for the science fiction series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (1978–81). He served in this role for the entirety of its four-series run, and also wrote several episodes himself, including the final episode.

Boucher was the script editor of the second series of the TV drama &quot;Shoestring&quot; in 1980, which followed the investigations of private detective and radio show host Eddie Shoestring (Trevor Eve). Following the end of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, Boucher script-edited and wrote for the third series of the police drama &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; in 1982. He then moved on to script-edit another detective show, &quot;Bergerac&quot;, working on the programme from 1983 to 1987.

All of the above programmes were produced in-house by the BBC and broadcast on the BBC1 network. For the ITV network, he worked on Thames Television&#x27;s police drama series &quot;The Bill&quot; as script editor in 1987. In that year he also returned to the BBC to create his own series, &quot;Star Cops&quot;, which combined the science fiction and crime genres. The series encountered several production problems and was not a ratings success, lasting only nine episodes on BBC2, but has maintained a cult following among fans of science fiction.

Later works included several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels for BBC Books, all featuring the character of Leela, and a series of straight-to-CD full-cast audio dramas entitled &quot;Kaldor City&quot;, which combine elements from his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; with his &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; work.

==Views and advocacy==
Boucher was an avowed atheist. He disapproved of the introduction of religion into government policy and the education of children.

== Personal life and death ==
Boucher married Lynda Macklin in 1966. They had three sons: Luke, Nathan and Daniel.

Boucher died on 11 December 2022, at the age of 79. He was the last surviving &quot;Doctor Who&quot; scriptwriter from prior to the 1980s.

<doc id="957421" wikidata="Q2357073" url="?curid=957421" title="Baduy people">
<text>Baduy people (; ) (sometimes spelled as Badui or Kanékés) are an indigenous Sundanese ethnic group native to the southeastern part of Banten, specifically Lebak Regency, Banten, Indonesia.

==Etymology==
The term is a short form derived from in the Baduy language. It is a native Sundanese term that refers to an endemic vine plant of western Java (&quot;Trichosanthes villosa&quot;), used as a herbal medicine since ancient times. As part of the Sundanese family, &quot;baduyut&quot; also bears the same meaning in Old and Modern Sundanese. It is likely that in ancient times, there was a river called Baduyut, as the term () itself literally means &quot;Baduyut River&quot; in the Sundanese language, thus it is possible that this tribe was named after the river. The Baduy people sometimes prefer to be called ( &quot;Kanekes people&quot;) or ( &quot;Cibeo people&quot;) instead, as these are the names of their cultural regions or villages.

There is also a theory suggesting that the word &quot;baduy&quot; was initially an exonym used by outsiders to refer to these tribal groups, stemming from the idea that the Dutch equated them with Bedouin Arabs.

==Sub-groups==
The Baduy are divided into three sub-groups:
# &quot;Tangtu&quot; ( &quot;Inner Baduy&quot;; )
# &quot;Panamping&quot; ( &quot;Outer Baduy&quot;; )
# &quot;Dangka&quot; ( &quot;Dangka Baduy&quot;; )
No foreigners are allowed to meet the Inner Baduy, though the Outer Baduy do foster some limited contacts with the outside world. Dangka Baduy have sustained contacts with the outside world and no longer live in the Kanekes area.

==Settlement area==
The Baduy region is geographically located at 6°27’27&quot; – 6°30’0&quot; south and 108°3’9&quot; – 106°4’55&quot; east. The Baduy population of 11,700 is centered at the foothills of the Kendeng mountains at the Kanekes settlement, Leuwidamar district, Lebak Regency, Banten, a distance of 40 km (25 miles) from Rangkasbitung. This region, part of the Kendeng mountains, with an elevation of 300–500 meters (975&#x27;-1,625&#x27;) above sea level, consists of hilly topography with surfaces that reach up to an average of 45% slope, with volcanic (in the north), precipitate (in the center), and mixed soil (in the south). The average temperature is 20 °C (70°F). The Baduy homeland in Java is contained in just of hilly forest area, from Jakarta, Indonesia&#x27;s capital. The three main settlements of the Kanekes people are Cikeusik, Cikertawana, and Cibeo.

==Language==
The native language of the Baduy people, Baduy, is most closely related and sometimes considered to be a dialect of Sundanese. Native speakers are dispersed in regions around the Mount Kendeng, Rangkasbitung district of Lebak Regency, Pandeglang Regency, and Sukabumi, West Java. It is estimated that there are 11,620 speakers as of 2010. In order to communicate with outsiders, the Baduy people tend to speak Sundanese proper and sometimes Indonesian to some degree of fluency. The Inner Baduy in Kanekes village are mostly illiterate, hence their customary, religious belief system and ancestral folk tales are preserved in a form of oral tradition.

===Education===
Formal education for Baduy children is seen by Baduy people as a violation of their traditional customs, and they have so far refused the Indonesian government&#x27;s proposals to build educational facilities in their villages. As a result, few Baduy people are educated or able to read or write.

==Origins==

===Mythology===
According to their belief system, the Kanekes people regard themselves as descendants of Batara Cikal, one of seven deities, or gods, that was sent to Earth. This origin story is often associated with the biblical first man, Adam. According to the Kanekes, Adam and his descendants have been given the task to meditate or practice asceticism in order to preserve the harmony of the world.

===History===
The Kanekes origin story differs from the opinions of historians, who base their theories on the synthesis of historical evidence in the form of inscriptions, written records of Portuguese and Chinese sailors, as well as the &#x27;Tatar Sunda&#x27; folklore, very little of which still remains. Some people believe that the Baduy are the descendants of the aristocracy of the Sunda Kingdom of Pajajaran, who lived near Batutulis, in the hills around Bogor, but there is no strong evidence to support this belief. The domestic architecture of that region follows most closely the traditional Sundanese architecture. Pakuwan Pajajaran port, known as Sunda Kelapa, was destroyed by invading Faletehan (Fatahillah) Muslim soldiers in 1579, and Dayeuh Pakuan, the capital of Pajajaran, was invaded by the Banten Sultanate some time later. Before the establishment of the sultanate, the western tip of Java island played an important role for the Sunda Kingdom, with Banten being a large trading port. Various types of vessels entered the Ciujung River, and most of them were used to transport crops that were harvested from the interior regions. Therefore, the ruler of the region, Prince Pucuk Umun, believed that the sustainability of the river needed to be maintained. An army of highly trained royal troops was commanded to guard and to manage the dense and hilly jungle areas in the region of Mount Kendeng. The troops, with their specific duties to that area, came largely from the Kanekes community, which still inhabits the upper part of Ciujung River at Gunung Kendeng.

The discrepancy between the two theories led to the notion that in the past, the identity and historicity of the Kanekes had been intentionally concealed, in order to protect the community from attacks by the Sunda Kingdom&#x27;s enemies. Van Tricht, a doctor who had done medical research in the area in 1928, denied this theory, however. According to him, the Kanekes people are natives of the region and have strongly resisted external influences. The Kanekes people themselves also refuse to acknowledge that they originate from the fugitives of Pajajaran, the capital of the Kingdom of Sunda. According to Danasasmita and Djatisunda, the Baduy people are local to the settlements that are officially mandated by the king, because the people are obliged to preserve the &quot;kabuyutan&quot; (ancestral or ancestral worship).

==Religion and beliefs==


The religion of the Baduy is known as &quot;Agama Sunda Wiwitan&quot; and is rooted in ancestral worship and honoring or worshiping spirits of natural forces. According to the &quot;kokolot&quot; (elders) of Cikeusik village, Kanekes people are not adherents of Hinduism or Buddhism. However, in its development, this faith is influenced by and has incorporated elements of Hinduism, and to some extent, Islam.

The form of respect for the spirits of natural forces is carried out by guarding and preserving the natural environment, such as the mountains, hills, valleys, forests, gardens, springs, rivers, and all the ecosystems within them, as well as giving their highest gratitude to nature by treating and protecting the jungle as part of an effort to maintain the balance of the universe. The core of this belief is shown by the existence of &quot;pikukuh&quot;, or the absolute customary provisions practiced in the daily lives of the Kanekes people. The most important principle of the Kanekes people&#x27;s &quot;pukukuh&quot; (adherence) is the concept of &quot;no changes of whatsoever&quot;, or the slightest change possible: &quot;Lojor heunteu beunang dipotong, pèndèk heunteu beunang disambung&quot; (meaning &quot;What&#x27;s long cannot be cut [to shorten], and what&#x27;s short cannot be attached [to lengthen]&quot;).

The Baduy also observe many mystical taboos. They are forbidden to kill, steal, lie, commit adultery, get drunk, eat food at night, take any form of conveyance, wear flowers or perfumes, accept gold or silver, touch money, or cut their hair. In agriculture, they practice &quot;pukukuh&quot; by not changing the contour of the land for their fields, so much so that the way of farming is very simple; not cultivating the land using plows or forming terraces, but only using hoe-farming methods, that is, with sharpened bamboo. In the construction of houses, the contouring of the soil surface is also left as is, therefore the poles of the Kanekes houses are often not of the same length. Words and actions of the Baduy people are expected to be honest, innocent, without beating around the bush, and devoid of bargaining in trade. Other taboos relate to defending Baduy lands against invasion: they may not grow sawah (wet rice), use fertilizers, raise cash crops, use modern tools for working &quot;ladang&quot; soil, or keep large domestic animals.

The most important religious object for the Kanekes people is the Arca Domas, whose location is kept secret and is considered sacred. The Kanekes people visit the site to worship once a year in the month of Kalima, which, in 2003, coincided with the month of July. Only &quot;Pu&#x27;un&quot;, or the highest customary chairman and several elected members of the community, will follow the entourage to worship. Rainwater is stored in a mortar container in the Arca Domas complex. If it is found to be clear at the time of worship, then it is a sign for the Kanekes people that there will be plenty of rain that year, and the harvest will be bountiful. Conversely, if the mortar container is dry, or the water is turbid, then it is a sign of crop failure.

A certain amount of Islamic influence has also penetrated into the religion of a few of the Baduy Luar in recent years (especially in Cicakal Girang village), with the addition of some original ideas. The ultimate authority is vested in &quot;Gusti Nu Maha Suci&quot;, who according to the Baduy sent Adam into the world to lead the life of a Baduy.

==Social classes==


The Kanekes people have a shared history and language with the Sundanese people. Some differences include their respective beliefs and lifestyles. The Kanekes people isolate themselves from the outside world and strictly preserve their traditional lifestyle, while the Sundanese are much more open to outside influences, and the majority of them embrace Islam.

Generally, the Baduy are divided into three groups, namely &quot;Tangtu&quot;, &quot;Panamping&quot;, and &quot;Dangka&quot;. The community of villages in which they live are called &quot;mandalas&quot;, derived from the Hindu/Buddhist concept but referring in the Indonesian context to places where religion is the central aspect of life.

The first group is &quot;Tangtu&quot;, or &quot;Kajeroan&quot;, also known as &quot;Baduy Dalam&quot; or &quot;Kanekes Dalam&quot; (meaning &quot;Inner Kanekes&quot;), with a population of about 400 consisting of forty families (&quot;Kajeroan&quot;) who live in the three villages of Cibeo, Cikertawana, and Cikeusik in Tanah Larangan (forbidden territory), where no stranger is permitted to spend the night. A characteristic of the Kanekes Dalam people is the color of their clothing—white and dark blue, as well as the wearing of a white headband. They follow the rigid &quot;buyut&quot; taboo system very strictly, (see § Religion and beliefs) and thus have made very little contact with the outside world. The priests of this community, known as &quot;pu&#x27;un&quot;, are the only ones allowed to visit the most sacred ground of the Baduy, which lies on Gunung Kendeng, in a place called Arca Domas. Unlike their Kanekes Luar counterparts, the Kanekes Dalam people are not influenced by Islam.

Some of the rules observed by the community include:
* No vehicles are allowed.
* No footwear is allowed.
* The door of the house should face north or south (except the house of the &quot;pu&#x27;un&quot;, or the customary chairman).
* Usage of electronic devices is prohibited.
* No modern clothing is allowed. Only hand-woven black or white fabrics are allowed.

The &quot;Panamping&quot;, also known as &quot;Baduy Luar&quot; or &quot;Kanekes Luar&quot; (meaning &quot;Outer Kanekes&quot;), make up the remainder of the Baduy population, living in 22 villages and acting as a barrier to stop visitors from contacting the more reclusive community. They also follow the rigid taboo system but not as strictly as the Kanekes Dalam, and they are more willing to accept modern influences into their daily lives. For example, some Kanekes Luar wear the colorful sarongs and shirts favored by their Sundanese neighbors. In the past, the Baduy Luar only wore their homespun blue-black cloth and were forbidden to wear trousers. Other elements of civilization (toys, money, batteries) are rapidly infiltrating, especially in the villages to the north, and it is no longer unusual for an Outer Baduy person to make a journey to Jakarta or even to work outside as a hired hand during the rice planting and harvest seasons. Some even work in big towns and cities like Jakarta, Bogor, and Bandung. Meat is eaten in some of the outer villages, where dogs are trained for hunting, though animal husbandry is still forbidden.

Some Kanekes Dalam have become Kanekes Luar, either through intermarriage or as a result of breaking Kanekes Dalam customary laws.

Characteristics of the Kanekes Luar include:
* They are familiar with technology such as electronic devices.
* Construction of houses in the Kanekes Luar permits the use of modern tools, such as saws, hammers, nails, etc.
* Wearing modern clothing like T-shirts and jeans is permitted.
* The use of modern home appliances, such as mattresses, pillows, plastic or glass plates and cups, etc, is allowed.
* A significant number have converted to Islam and been influenced by the outside world.

There are two Kanekes Luar settlements, namely Padawaras (Cibengkung) and Sirahdayeuh (Cihadam), which function as a buffer between the Kanekes Dalam and the outside world.

==Governance==
The Kanekes community recognizes two governing systems: the national system, which is in accordance with the laws of Indonesia, and the customary system, which abides by the customs of the community. Both are combined or acculturated in such a way that there is no conflict. Conventionally, the Kanekes people are led by a head of settlement, who is referred to as &quot;jaro pamarentah&quot;. Customarily, the Kanekes people fall under the leadership of the &quot;pu&#x27;un&quot;, who can be found in three settlements, or &quot;tangtu&quot;. The position is passed down through generations, but not necessarily from a father to his children; it can also be handed down to other relatives. The governing term of a &quot;pu&#x27;un&quot; is not specified; instead, it depends on a person&#x27;s ability to hold on to the position.

==Livelihood==
As it has been the case for hundreds of years, the main livelihood of the Kanekes people is rice farming. Apart from that, they also earn extra income from selling the fruits they gather from the jungle, such as durian and tamarind-plum, as well as wild honey.

==External interactions==
The Kanekes community, who until the present have adhered strictly to their customs, has not been entirely isolated from the developments of the outside world. They became aware of the establishment of the Sultanate of Banten, which automatically annexed the Kanekes people into the kingdom&#x27;s territory of power. As a sign of obedience to and recognition of these authorities, the Kanekes community routinely perform the &quot;seba&quot; ceremony each year, which involves delivering crops such as rice and fruit to the Governor of Banten (and formerly to the Governor of West Java) through the regent of Lebak. In agriculture, the Kanekes Luar people interact closely with outsiders in affairs such as leasing of land and laborers.

In the past, trading was done by barter, but nowadays, the community uses the national currency, the rupiah. The Kanekes people sell fruits, honey, and sugar palm through middlemen. They also purchase necessities that they do not produce themselves from markets.

Today, visitors to the Kanekes customary region are increasing, with a large number consisting of high school or college students. These are welcomed into the community and can even spend the night there, provided that they abide by local rules. These include a ban on taking pictures within the Kanekes Dalam areas as well as a prohibition on the use of soap or toothpaste in the rivers. The customary region of the Kanekes people remains forbidden to non-Indonesians, however, including journalists.

<text>A keep is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word &quot;keep&quot;, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England, Portugal, south Italy and Sicily. As a result of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, use spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries, including Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take a decade or more to build.

During the 12th century, new designs began to be introduced – in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. By the end of the century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without keeps. In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall fighting towers called &quot;bergfriede&quot; were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. In the second half of the 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. In France, the keep at Vincennes near Paris began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Meanwhile, tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period.

In the 15th century, the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery. For example, in 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, the keep of Bamburgh Castle on the Northumberland coast, previously considered to be impregnable, was defeated with bombards. By the 16th century, keeps were slowly falling out of fashion as fortifications and residences. Many were destroyed in civil wars between the 17th and 18th centuries or incorporated into gardens as an alternative to follies. During the 19th century, keeps became fashionable once again, and in England and France, a number were restored or redesigned by Gothic architects. Despite further damage to many French and Spanish keeps during the wars of the 20th century, keeps now form an important part of the tourist and heritage industry in Europe.

==Etymology and historiography==
 Since the 16th century, the English word &quot;keep&quot; has commonly referred to large towers in castles. The word originates from around 1375 to 1376, coming from the Middle English term &quot;kype&quot;, meaning basket or cask, and was a term applied to the shell keep at Guînes, said to resemble a barrel. The term came to be used for other shell keeps by the 15th century. By the 17th century, the word keep lost its original reference to baskets or casks and was popularly assumed to have come from the Middle English word &quot;keep&quot;, meaning to hold or to protect.

Early on, the use of the word &quot;keep&quot; became associated with the idea of a tower in a castle that would serve both as a fortified, high-status private residence and a refuge of last resort. The issue was complicated by the building of fortified Renaissance towers in Italy called &quot;tenazza&quot; that were used as defences of last resort and were also named after the Italian for &quot;to hold&quot; or &quot;to keep&quot;. By the 19th century, Victorian historians incorrectly concluded that the etymology of the words &quot;keep&quot; and &quot;tenazza&quot; were linked and that all keeps had fulfilled this military function.

As a result of this evolution in meaning, the use of the term &quot;keep&quot; in historical analysis today can be problematic. Contemporary medieval writers used various terms for the buildings we would today call keeps. In Latin, they are variously described as &quot;turris&quot;, &quot;turris castri&quot; or &quot;magna turris&quot; – a &quot;tower&quot;, a &quot;castle tower&quot;, or a &quot;great tower&quot;. The 12th-century French came to term them a donjon, from the Latin &quot;dominarium&quot; &quot;lordship&quot;, linking the keep and feudal authority. Similarly, medieval Spanish writers called the buildings &quot;torre del homenaje&quot;, or &quot;tower of homage&quot;. In England, &quot;donjon&quot; turned into &quot;dungeon&quot;, which initially referred to a keep, rather than to a place of imprisonment.

While the term remains in common academic use, some academics prefer to use the term &quot;donjon&quot;, and most modern historians warn against using the term &quot;keep&quot; simplistically. The fortifications that we would today call keeps did not necessarily form part of a unified medieval style, nor were they all used in a similar fashion during the period.

==History==

===Timber keeps (9th–12th centuries)===
The earliest keeps were built as part of motte-and-bailey castles from the 10th century onwards – a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence places the first such castle, built at Vincy, in 979. These castles were initially built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries, in particular Fulk III and his son, Geoffrey II, who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060. William the Conqueror then introduced this form of castle into England when he invaded in 1066, and the design spread through south Wales as the Normans expanded up the valleys during the subsequent decades.
In a motte-and-bailey design, a castle would include a mound called a motte, usually artificially constructed by piling up turf and soil, and a bailey, a lower walled enclosure. A keep and a protective wall would usually be built on top of the motte. Some protective walls around a keep would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight – this was called a &quot;garillum&quot;. Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander keep. Many wooden keeps were designed with a &quot;bretasche&quot;, a square structure that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design. These wooden keeps could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them from being easily set alight during a siege.

One contemporary account of these keeps comes from Jean de Colmieu around 1130, who described how the nobles of the Calais region would build &quot;a mound of earth as high as they can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible. The space on top of the mound is enclosed by a palisade of very strong hewn logs, strengthened at intervals by as many towers as their means can provide. Inside the enclosure is a citadel, or keep, which commands the whole circuit of the defences. The entrance to the fortress is by means of a bridge, which, rising from the outer side of the moat and supported on posts as it ascends, reches to the top of the mound.&quot; At Durham Castle, contemporaries described how the keep arose from the &quot;tumulus of rising earth&quot; with a keep reaching &quot;into thin air, strong within and without&quot;, a &quot;stalwart house...glittering with beauty in every part&quot;. As well as having defensive value, keeps and mottes sent a powerful political message to the local population.

Wooden keeps could be quite extensive in size and, as Robert Higham and Philip Barker have noted, it was possible to build &quot;...very tall and massive structures.&quot; As an example of what these keeps may have comprised, the early 12th-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres described the wooden keep on top of the motte at the castle of Ardres, where the &quot;...first storey was on the surface of the ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils. In the storey above were the dwelling and common living-rooms of the residents in which were the larders, the rooms of the bakers and butlers, and the great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept...In the upper storey of the house were garret rooms...In this storey also the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the house took their sleep.&quot;

In the Holy Roman Empire, tall, free-standing, wooden (later stone), fighting towers called &quot;Bergfriede&quot; were commonly built by the 11th century, either as part of motte-and-bailey designs or, as part of &quot;Hohenburgen&quot; castles, with characteristic inner and outer courts. &quot;Bergfriede&quot;, which take their name from the German for a belfry, had similarities to keeps, but are usually distinguished from them on account of &quot;Bergfriede&quot; having a smaller area or footprint, usually being non-residential and being typically integrated into the outer defences of a castle, rather than being a safe refuge of last resort.

===Early stone keeps (10th–12th centuries)===

During the 10th century, a small number of stone keeps began to be built in France, such at the Château de Langeais: in the 11th century, their numbers increased as the style spread through Normandy across the rest of France and into England, South Italy and Sicily. Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep usually amongst the first parts to be upgraded, while in other cases new keeps were built from scratch in stone. These stone keeps were introduced into Ireland during the 1170s following the Norman occupation of the east of the country, where they were particularly popular amongst the new Anglo-Norman lords. Two broad types of design emerged across France and England during the period: four-sided stone keeps, known as Norman keeps or great keeps in English – a &quot;donjon carré&quot; or &quot;donjon roman&quot; in French – and circular shell keeps.

The reasons for the transition from timber to stone keeps are unclear, and the process was slow and uneven, taking many years to take effect across the various regions. Traditionally it was believed that stone keeps had been adopted because of the cruder nature of wooden buildings, the limited lifespan of wooden fortifications and their vulnerability to fire, but recent archaeological studies have shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as sophisticated as their stone equivalents. Some wooden keeps were not converted into stone for many years and were instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen. Nonetheless, stone became increasingly popular as a building material for keeps for both military and symbolic reasons.

Stone keep construction required skilled craftsmen. Unlike timber and earthworks, which could be built using unfree labour or serfs, these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to the limitations of the lime mortar used during the period – a keep&#x27;s walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. The number of such keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.
Norman keeps had four sides, with the corners reinforced by pilaster buttresses; some keeps, particularly in Normandy and France, had a &quot;barlongue&quot; design, being rectangular in plan with their length twice their width, while others, particularly in England, formed a square. These keeps could be up to four storeys high, with the entrance placed on the first storey to prevent the door from being easily broken down; early French keeps had external stairs in wood, whilst later castles in both France and England built them in stone. In some cases the entrance stairs were protected by additional walls and a door, producing a forebuilding. The strength of the Norman design typically came from the thickness of the keep&#x27;s walls: usually made of rag-stone, these could be up to 24 feet (7.3 metres) thick, immensely strong, and producing a steady temperature inside the building throughout summer and winter. The larger keeps were subdivided by an internal wall while the smaller versions had a single, slightly cramped chamber on each floor. Usually only the first floor would be vaulted in stone, with the higher storeys supported with timbers.

There has been extensive academic discussion of the extent to which Norman keeps were designed with a military or political function in mind, particularly in England. Earlier analyses of Norman keeps focused on their military design, and historians such as R. Brown Cathcart King proposed that square keeps were adopted because of their military superiority over timber keeps. Most of these Norman keeps were certainly extremely physically robust, even though the characteristic pilaster buttresses added little real architectural strength to the design. Many of the weaknesses inherent to their design were irrelevant during the early part of their history. The corners of square keeps were theoretically vulnerable to siege engines and galleried mining, but before the introduction of the trebuchet at the end of the 12th century, early artillery stood little practical chance of damaging the keeps, and galleried mining was rarely practised. Similarly, the corners of a square keep created dead space that defenders could not fire at, but missile fire in castle sieges was less important until the introduction of the crossbow in the middle of the 12th century, when arrowslits began to be introduced.
Nonetheless, many stone Norman keeps made considerable compromises to military utility. Norwich Castle, for example, included elaborate blind arcading on the outside of the building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony, rather than for defence. The interior of the keep at Hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower, Colchester, and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style, often reusing Roman materials and sites, and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people. The political value of these keep designs, and the social prestige they lent to their builders, may help explain why they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century, beyond the point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted.

The second early stone design, emerging from the 12th century onwards, was the shell keep, a &quot;donjon annulaire&quot; in French, which involved replacing the wooden keep on a motte, or the palisade on a ringwork, with a circular stone wall. Shell keeps were sometimes further protected by an additional low protective wall, called a chemise, around their base. Buildings could then be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard at the centre. The style was particularly popular in south-east England and across Normandy, although less so elsewhere. Restormel Castle is a classic example of this development, as is the later Launceston Castle; prominent Normandy and Low Country equivalents include Gisors and the Burcht van Leiden – these castles were amongst the most powerful fortifications of the period. Although the circular design held military advantages over one with square corners, as noted above these really mattered from only the end of the 12th century onwards; the major reason for adopting a shell keep design, in the 12th century at least, was the circular design of the original earthworks exploited to support the keep; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that found at Windsor Castle.

===Mid-medieval keeps (late 12th–14th centuries)===
During the second half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, breaking the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.

Through most of the 12th century, France was divided between the Capetian kings, ruling from the Île-de-France, and kings of England, who controlled Normandy and much of the west of France. Within the Capetian territories, early experimentation in new keep designs began at Houdan in 1120, where a circular keep was built with four round turrets; internally, however, the structure remained conventionally square. A few years later, Château d&#x27;Étampes adopted a quatrefoil design. These designs, however, remained isolated experiments.

In the 1190s, however, the struggle for power in France began to swing in favour of Philip II, culminating in the Capetian capture of Normandy in 1204. Philip II started to construct completely circular keeps, such as the Tour Jeanne d&#x27;Arc, with most built in his newly acquired territories. The first of Philip&#x27;s new keeps was begun at the Louvre in 1190 and at least another twenty followed, all built to a consistent standard and cost. The architectural idea of circular keeps may have come from Catalonia, where circular towers in castles formed a local tradition, and probably carried some military advantages, but Philip&#x27;s intention in building these new keeps in a fresh style was clearly political, an attempt to demonstrate his new power and authority over his extended territories. As historian Philippe Durand suggests, these keeps provided military security and were a physical representation of the &quot;renouveau capétien&quot;, or Capetian renewal.
Keep design in England began to change only towards the end of the 12th century, later than in France. Wooden keeps on mottes ceased to be built across most of England by the 1150s, although they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Welsh Marches. By the end of the 12th century, England and Ireland saw a handful of innovative angular or polygonal keeps built, including the keep at Orford Castle, with three rectangular, clasping towers built out from the high, circular central tower; the cross-shaped keep of Trim Castle and the famous polygonal design at Conisborough. Despite these new designs, square keeps remained popular across much of England and, as late as the 1170s, square Norman great keeps were being built at Newcastle. Circular keep designs similar to those in France really became popular in Britain in the Welsh Marches and Scotland for only a short period during the early 13th century.

As with the new keeps constructed in France, these Anglo-Norman designs were informed both by military thinking and by political drivers. The keep at Orford has been particularly extensively analysed in this regard, and although traditional explanations suggested that its unusual plan was the result of an experimental military design, more recent analysis concludes that the design was instead probably driven by political symbolism and the need for Henry to dominate the contested lands of East Anglia. The architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur or Constantinople, then the idealised versions of royal and imperial power. Even formidable military designs such as that at Château Gaillard were built with political effect in mind. Gaillard was designed to reaffirm Angevin authority in a fiercely disputed conflict zone and the keep, although militarily impressive, contained only an anteroom and a royal audience chamber, and was built on soft chalk and without an internal well, both serious defects from a defensive perspective.

During most of the medieval period, Iberia was divided between Christian and Islamic kingdoms, neither of which traditionally built keeps, instead building watchtowers or mural towers. By the 12th century, however, the influence of France and the various military orders was encouraging the development of square keeps in Christian castles across the region, and by the second half of the century this practice was spread across into the Islamic kingdoms.
By contrast, the remainder of Europe saw stone towers being used in castles, but not in a way that fulfilled the range of functions seen in the western European keeps. In the Low Countries, it became popular for the local nobility to build stand-alone, square towers, but rarely as part of a wider castle. Similarly, square stone towers became popular in Venice, but these did not fulfil the same role as western keeps. In Germany, rectangular stone castles began to replace motte-and-bailey castles from the 12th century onwards. These designs included stone versions of the traditional &quot;Bergfriede&quot;, which still remained distinct from the domestic keeps used in more western parts of Europe, with the occasional notable exception, such as the large, residential &quot;Bergfried&quot; at Eltville Castle.

Several designs for new castles emerged that made keeps unnecessary. One such design was the concentric approach, involving exterior walls guarded with towers, and perhaps supported by further, concentric layered defenses: thus castles such as Framlingham never had a central keep. Military factors may well have driven this development: R. Brown, for example, suggests that designs with a separate keep and bailey system inherently lacked a co-ordinated and combined defensive system, and that once bailey walls were sophisticated enough, a keep became militarily unnecessary. In England, gatehouses were also growing in size and sophistication until they too challenged the need for a keep in the same castle. The classic Edwardian gatehouse, with two large, flanking towers and multiple portcullises, designed to be defended from attacks both within and outside the main castle, has been often compared to the earlier Norman keeps: some of the largest gatehouses are called gatehouse keeps for this reason.

The quadrangular castle design that emerged in France during the 13th century was another development that removed the need for a keep. Castles had needed additional living space since their first emergence in the 9th century; initially this had been provided by halls in the bailey, then later by ranges of chambers alongside the inside of a bailey wall, such as at Goodrich. But French designs in the late 12th century took the layout of a contemporary unfortified manor house, whose rooms faced around a central, rectangular courtyard, and built a wall around them to form a castle. The result, illustrated initially at Yonne, and later at Château de Farcheville, was a characteristic quadrangular layout with four large, circular corner towers. It lacked a keep, which was not needed to support this design.

===Late medieval keeps (14th–16th centuries)===
The end of the medieval period saw a fresh resurgence in the building of keeps in western castles. Some castles continued to be built without keeps: the Bastille in the 1370s, for example, combined a now traditional quadrangular design with machicolated corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls, innovatively, were of equal height to the towers. This fashion became copied across French and in England, particularly amongst the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, for example at Nunney. The royalty and the very wealthiest in France, England and Spain, however, began to construct a small number of keeps on a much larger scale than before, in England sometimes termed tower keeps, as part of new palace fortresses. This shift reflected political and social pressures, such as the desire of the wealthiest lords to have privacy from their growing households of retainers, as well as the various architectural ideas being exchanged across the region, despite the ongoing Hundred Years War between France and England.

The resurgence in French keep design began after the defeat of the royal armies at the battles of Crécy in 1346 and Poitiers in 1356, which caused high levels of social unrest across the remaining French territories. Charles V of France attempted to restore French royal authority and prestige through the construction of a new range of castles. The Château de Vincennes, where a new keep was completed under Charles by 1380, was the first example of these &quot;palace fortresses&quot;. The keep at Vincennes was highly innovative: six stories high, with a &quot;chemin de ronde&quot; running around the machicolated battlements; the luxuriously appointed building was protected by an &quot;enceinte&quot; wall that formed a &quot;fortified envelope&quot; around the keep. The Vincennes keep was copied elsewhere across France, particularly as the French kings reconquered territories from the English, encouraging a style that emphasised very tall keeps with prominent machicolations. No allowance for the emerging new gunpowder weapons was made in these keeps, although later in the century gunports were slowly being added, as for example by Charles VI to his keep at Saint-Malo.
The French model spread into Iberia in the second half of the century, where the most powerful nobles in Castile built a number of similar tall keeps, such as that at Peñafiel, taking advantage of the weakness of the Castilian Crown during the period. Henry IV of Castile responded in the 15th century by creating a sequence of royal castles with prominent keeps at the Castle of La Mota, Portillo, and Alcázar of Segovia: built to particular proportions, these keeps became known as a key element of the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Smaller versions of these keeps were subsequently built by many aspiring new aristocracy in Spain, including many converted Jews, keen to improve their social prestige and position in society. The French model of tall keeps was also echoed in some German castles, such as that at Karlštejn, although the layout and positioning of these towers still followed the existing &quot;bergfried&quot; model, rather than that in western castles. An other impressive 15th century metiterenian castle keep is the keep of the Kolossi Castle, in Cyprus, a three floor square keep, 21 meters high. 

The 15th and 16th centuries saw a small number of English and occasional Welsh castles develop still grander keeps. The first of these large &quot;tower keeps&quot; were built in the north of England during the 14th century, at locations such as Warkworth. They were probably partially inspired by designs in France, but they also reflected the improvements in the security along the Scottish border during the period, and the regional rise of major noble families such as the Percies and the Nevilles, whose wealth encouraged a surge in castle building at the end of the 14th century. New castles at Raby, Bolton, and Warkworth Castle took the quadrangular castle styles of the south and combined them with exceptionally large tower keeps to form a distinctive, northern style. Built by major noble houses, these castles were typically even more opulent than the smaller castles like Nunney, built by the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;. They marked what historian Anthony Emery has described as a &quot;...second peak of castle building in England and Wales,&quot; following on from the Edwardian designs at the end of the 14th century.

In the 15th century, the fashion for the creation of very expensive, French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps spread, with new keeps being built at Wardour, Tattershall, and Raglan Castle. In central and eastern England, some keeps began to be built in brick, with Caister and Tattershall forming examples of this trend. In Scotland, the construction of Holyrood Great Tower between 1528 and 1532 drew on this English tradition, but incorporated additional French influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable keep, guarded by a gun park. These tower keeps were expensive buildings to construct, each built to a unique design for a specific lord and, as historian Norman Pounds has suggested, they &quot;...were designed to allow very rich men to live in luxury and splendour.&quot;
At the same time as these keeps were being built by the extremely wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps but rather as a form of fortified house.

As the 16th century progressed, keeps fell out of fashion once again. In England, the gatehouse also began to supplant the keep as the key focus for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken the keep as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new keeps were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further move away from the use of keeps. Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces by the middle of the century, and this style was impossible to fit into a traditional keep. The keep at Bolsover Castle in England was one of the few to be built as part of a Palladian design.

===Later use and destruction of keeps (17th–21st centuries)===
From the 17th century onwards, some keeps were deliberately destroyed. In England, many were destroyed after the end of the Second English Civil War in 1649, when Parliament took steps to prevent another royalist uprising by slighting, or damaging, castles so as to prevent them from having any further military utility. Slighting was quite expensive and took considerable effort to carry out, so damage was usually done in the most cost-efficient fashion with only selected walls being destroyed. Keeps were singled out for particular attention in this process because of their continuing political and cultural importance, and the prestige they lent their former royalist owners – at Kenilworth, for example, only the keep was slighted, and at Raglan, the keep was the main focus of parliamentary activity. There was some equivalent destruction of keeps in France in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as the slighting of Montaiguillon by Cardinal Richelieu in 1624, but the catalogue of damage was far less than that of the 1640s and early 1650s in England.

In England, ruined medieval castles became fashionable again in the middle of the 18th century. They were considered an interesting counterpoint to Palladian classical architecture, and gave a degree of medieval allure to their owners. Some keeps were modified to exaggerate this effect: Hawarden, for example, was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed, the better to produce a good silhouette. The interest continued and, in the late 18th and 19th century, it became fashionable to build intact, replica castles in England, resulting in what A. Rowan has called the &quot;Norman style&quot; of new castle building, characterised by the inclusion of large keeps; the final replica keep to be built in this way was at Penrhyn between 1820 and 1840.
Where there was an existing castle on a site, another response across 19th-century Europe was to attempt to improve the buildings, bringing their often chaotic historic features into line with a more integrated architectural aesthetic, in a style often termed Gothic Revivalism. There were numerous attempts to restore or rebuild keeps so as to produce this consistently Gothic style: in England, the architect Anthony Salvin was particularly prominent – as illustrated by reworking and heightening of the keep at Windsor Castle, while in France, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc reworked the keeps at castles in locations like Pierrefonds during the 1860s and 1870s, admittedly in a largely speculative fashion, since the original keep had been mostly destroyed in 1617.

The Spanish Civil War and First and Second World Wars in the 20th century caused damage to many castle keeps across Europe; in particular, the famous keep at Coucy was destroyed by the German Army in 1917. By the late 20th century the conservation of castle keeps formed part of government policy across France, England, Ireland, and Spain. In the 21st century in England, most keeps are in ruins and form part of the tourism and heritage industries, rather than being used as functioning buildings – the keep of Windsor Castle being a rare exception. In Germany, large numbers of the &quot;bergfried&quot; towers were restored as functional buildings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often as government offices or youth hostels, or the modern conversion of tower houses, which in many cases have become modernised domestic homes.

<doc id="957428" wikidata="Q1137753" url="?curid=957428" title="Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental was an award presented at the 31st Grammy Awards in 1989 to honor quality hard rock/metal works (albums or songs). The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&quot;

==Overview==
The Academy recognized hard rock music artists for the first time in 1989 with the category Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, combining two of the most popular music genres of the 1980s. Metallica, who were expected to win the inaugural award for their album &quot;...And Justice for All,&quot; lost to Jethro Tull whose album &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; won, also beating out Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Iggy Pop, as well as AC/DC.

This choice led to widespread criticism of the Academy, as journalists suggested that Jethro Tull&#x27;s music did not belong in either the hard rock or heavy metal genres. In response, the Academy separated the genres creating the categories Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance. This incident is often considered an example of the Grammy Awards being out of touch with popular sentiment, and was named the biggest upset in Grammy history by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

In 2012, the combined Hard Rock/Metal category returned following a major overhaul of Grammy Award categories. The separate Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance categories were merged into the slightly renamed Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category. However, in June 2013, it was announced that the combined category was being discontinued in favor of reinstating Best Metal Performance. Beginning in 2014, quality hard rock performances were recognized under the category Best Rock Performance.

==Award==
In 1988, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences added a Hard Rock/Metal Performance category for the 31st Grammy Awards. Nominated works for the award were &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; by AC/DC, &quot;Cold Metal&quot; by Iggy Pop (from the album &quot;Instinct&quot;), &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; by Jane&#x27;s Addiction, &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; by Jethro Tull, and &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; by Metallica. Jethro Tull&#x27;s lead singer Ian Anderson was surprised by the band&#x27;s nomination, as both Anderson and music critics did not consider the group&#x27;s music to be part of the heavy metal music genre.
Metallica&#x27;s performance at the ceremony, held in February 1989 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, marked the first time a heavy metal group had performed during the Grammy Awards. Metallica was expected to win the award, and members of Jethro Tull were told by their record label Chrysalis Records not to bother attending the ceremony because they &quot;weren&#x27;t likely to win.&quot; However, Jethro Tull won the award (recipients included members Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, and Dave Pegg), and when presenters Alice Cooper and Lita Ford announced the result, booing could be heard from the crowd. Anderson, who assumed that the band was being recognized for their twenty-year history, as opposed to a single album, later stated that he was &quot;lucky&quot; not to have attended the ceremony, as &quot;there&#x27;s no way I could have accepted it under those circumstances.&quot;

==Controversy and aftermath==

The result, considered an &quot;embarrassment&quot; for the Academy, generated much controversy. In response to the criticism they received over the award, Jethro Tull&#x27;s record label took out an advertisement in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine with a picture of a flute (part of their trademark sound) lying amid a pile of iron rebars and the line, &quot;The flute is a heavy, metal instrument!&quot; Metallica also added a sticker to subsequent releases of &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, reading: &quot;Grammy Award LOSERS&quot;.

Separate awards for Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance were introduced in 1990. Beginning that year, Metallica won three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance for the song &quot;One&quot; from &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, their cover of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, and their eponymous album in 1992. When Metallica won the Grammy in 1992, drummer Lars Ulrich referenced the previous award by facetiously &quot;thanking&quot; Jethro Tull for not putting out an album that year, though they actually had released the album &quot;Catfish Rising&quot; in 1991. A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: &quot;I&#x27;d be lying if I didn&#x27;t tell you I was disappointed. Human nature is that you&#x27;d rather win than lose, but Jethro Tull walking away with it makes a huge mockery of the intentions of the event.&quot; As of 2010, Metallica holds the record for the most wins in the metal category, with a total of six.

This incident is often cited as an example of the Grammy Awards selection committee being out of touch with popular sentiment, and was named the biggest upset in Grammy history by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Other publications that have included the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance upset in their lists of top Grammy moments include Cracked.com (number one), &quot;Time&quot; (number ten), and the &quot;Ventura County Star&quot; (number twenty).

<text>The Sasak (Balinese script: ᬲᬸᬓᬸ​ᬲᬲᬓ᭄, &quot;Wång Sâsak&quot;) people live mainly on the island of Lombok, Indonesia, numbering around 3.6 million (85% of Lombok&#x27;s population). They are related to the Balinese in language and in ancestry, although the Sasak are predominantly Muslim while the Balinese are predominantly Hindu. Sasak people who practice pre-Islamic beliefs are also known as Sasak Boda in reference to the name of the Sasak people&#x27;s original religion, Bodha.

== Etymology ==
There is a possibility that the origin of the name &quot;Sasak&quot; came from the word &quot;sak-sak&quot;, which means &quot;boat&quot;. In the Nagarakretagama, the word &quot;Sasak&quot; is mentioned together as one with Lombok Island, namely &quot;Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi&quot;. According to local tradition, it is believed that the word &quot;Sasak&quot; came from &quot;sa&#x27;-saq&quot; which means &quot;the one&quot;. Followed by the word &quot;Lombok&quot; which originates from the word &quot;Lomboq&quot;, meaning &quot;straight&quot;. Hence by combining the words together &quot;Sa&#x27;-saq Lombok&quot;, it means &quot;something that&#x27;s straight&quot;. Other translations also includes &quot;a straight road&quot;. &quot;Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi&quot; is taken from the Nagarakretagama (Desawarnana) literature, a scripture written by Mpu Prapanca that records the power and rule of the Majapahit kingdom. The word &quot;Lombok&quot; in Kawi means &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;Mirah&quot; means &quot;gem&quot;, &quot;Sasak&quot; means &quot;statement&quot;, and &quot;Adhi&quot; means &quot;something that&#x27;s good&quot; or &quot;utmost&quot;. Therefore &quot;Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi&quot; means &quot;honesty is the gem that states out goodness&quot;.

== History ==

Little is known about Sasak history except that Lombok was placed under direct rule of the Majapahit prime Minister, patih Gajah Mada. Islam arrived into the area around the 15th century. The Sasaks converted to Islam between the late 16th century to early 17th century under the influence of Pangeran Prapen (Sunan Prapen), the son of Raden Paku (Sunan Giri) or Sunan Giri himself and the Muslim Makassarese, frequently mixing basic Islamic beliefs with Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, thus creating the Wetu Telu religion. Lombok was conquered by the Gelgel Balinese kingdom in the early 16th century, thus bringing a large population of Balinese to Lombok. The Balinese population of Lombok today is about 300,000, 10–15% of Lombok&#x27;s population. The Balinese have also strongly influenced the Wetu Telu religion of Lombok.

== Language ==

The Sasak language is an Austronesian language that belongs to the group of Indonesian type language. Specifically, Sasak belongs to the languages of Western Indonesia which also means it is closely related to the languages of Java and Bali. There are also a number of Sasak dialects in various regions such as Kuto-Kute (North Sasak), Meno-Mene (Central Sasak), Meriak-Meriku (Central South Sasak), Ngeno-Ngene (Central East Sasak, Central West Sasak), Ngeto-Ngete (Northeast Sasak) and so on.

== Religion ==
Most of the Sasaks today are adherents of the Lima Waktu version of Islam. Lima Waktu or Five Times signifies the five daily prayers which Muslims are required to do. The term Lima Waktu is used to distinguish them from the Sasaks who are practitioners of Wetu Telu or Three Symbols who only pray three times a day. Orthodox Islamic teachers generally instruct adherents to pray five times a day. Large numbers of people adhering to the Wetu Telu faith can be still found throughout the island, especially in the village of Bayan, where the religion originated. Large Wetu Telu communities can be still found in Mataram, Pujung, Sengkol, Rambitan, Sade, Tetebatu, Bumbung, Sembalun, Senaru, Loyok and Pasugulan. 

A small minority of Sasaks called the Bodha (estimated population: 8,000) are mainly found in the village of Bentek and on the slopes of Gunung Rinjani. They are totally untouched by Islamic influence and worship animistic gods, incorporating some Hindu and Buddhist influences in their rituals and religious vocabulary. This group of Sasak, due in part to the name of their tribe, are recognized as Buddhists by the Indonesian government. The Bodha have the same magico-religious officials and institutions as the Wetu Telu (with the exception of course of the Kiyai, the Wetu Telu religious official dealing with all aspects of the Wetu Telu religion which mixes Islam and animism). The Bodhas recognize the existence of five main gods, the highest of which is Batara Guru, followed by Batara Sakti and Batara Jeneng with their wives Idadari Sakti and Idadari Jeneng, though they also believe in spirits and ghosts. The Bodha religion is also to some extent influenced by both Hindu and Buddhist concepts. Of late, many of them have embraced Theravada Buddhism due to the effort and support from Buddhist missionaries.

<text>Sardine v (Sardine) were an Australian post-punk band, formed in 1980 by Ian Rilen (X, Rose Tattoo) on guitar and vocals, and his then-wife, Stephanie Rilen (a.k.a. Stephanie Falconer) on lead vocals and keyboards. They released a single, &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1982), and an extended play, &quot;I Hate You&quot; (1983). Other members included Johanna Pigott on bass guitar and Andrew Garton on saxophone. Sardine v disbanded in 1983.

== History ==
According to Ian Rilen, Sardine v formed in 1980 in Sydney, Australia after he bought a keyboard for his children and his then-wife Stephanie Rilen (now Falconer). He had been unaware that Stephanie played piano until an incident when he was writing songs, and she began to play along with him.

Ian was on the guitar and vocals and Stephanie on lead vocals and keyboards. Sardine v soon recruited Phil Hall (Dropbears, Lime Spiders) on bass guitar and Greg Skehill on drums. Their first show, at the Rockgarden on 13 December 1980, was a sell out, sharing the bill with Machinations and Love Mum and the Urgent Ring Me&#x27;s. An invitation, promotional card for the show was included in the Powerhouse Museum&#x27;s &quot;Real Wild Child&quot; exhibition from 1994.

Sardine v were managed by SCAM (Suss City Artist Management), which also looked after the Sunnyboys, Machinations, Tablewaiters and Local Product. Lobby Loyde, part owner of SCAM, was co-producer on Sardine v&#x27;s single, &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1981), with Damien Lovelock of the Celibate Rifles. 

Alan Lefebvre of &quot;Tharunka&quot; opined that it &quot;starts off like another boring pop song – count to 8 and oh but it comes on like a speed rush... Through blurry eyes in the pits of a sleazy pub or early morning Manzil Room is where the &#x27;Sabotage&#x27; started... Wonderful stuff, and pass the whisky laced speed, whilst we wait for the album!&quot;

Although the band was popular live (performing for crowds of 800-1000), their music sales did not match this. 

A music video of the band performing &quot;Sudan&quot; was broadcast on ABC-TV&#x27;s pop music show &quot;Countdown&quot; and showed Ian Rilen on guitar, Stephanie Rilen on keyboards and lead vocals, Johanna Pigott on bass guitar, and Barton Price on drums. 

After the group broke up in 1983, Ian Rilen went back to playing with X. Clinton Walker later recalled that they were &quot;inner city modern and looked like a million bucks with Ian in a powder blue suit and his hair all slicked back like a gangster and Steph in an evening gown, but it just fizzled out.&quot;

Hunters &amp; Collectors covered their track &quot;Stuck on You&quot; on their 1986 album &quot;Human Frailty&quot; and added it to their set. Mark Seymour of Hunters &amp; Collectors described the track &quot;A Darlinghurst love triangle. Sardine V, the band... first witnessed at the Trade Union Club, 1983.&quot;

Stephanie Rilen later married Doug Falconer, the drummer of that band. Both tracks from the single appeared on compilation albums by various artists. The Deadly Hume covered &quot;I Hate You&quot; on the Phantom Records tenth anniversary compilation, &quot;Assorted Desecrations and Magnificent Mutations&quot; (1988).

<doc id="957465" wikidata="Q1507776" url="?curid=957465" title="George Long (scholar)">
<text>George Long (4 November 1800 – 10 August 1879) was an English writer and classical scholar. He is best known for his books Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (1862) and Discourses of Epictetus (1877). Alongside Charles Knight, he was the editor of the Penny Cyclopaedia, and he was widely known throughout England.

==Life==
Long was born at Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, the son of James Long, West India merchant.

 He was educated at Macclesfield Grammar School, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and later Trinity College, Cambridge.

He was Craven university scholar in 1821 (bracketed with Lord Macaulay and Henry Maiden), wrangler and senior chancellor&#x27;s medallist in 1822 and became a fellow of Trinity in 1823. In 1824 he was elected professor of ancient languages in the new University of Virginia at Charlottesville, but after four years returned to England as the first professor of Greek at the newly founded University College in London. Long owned (or possibly hired) a slave named Jacob while he was at the University.

In 1842 he succeeded T. H. Key as Professor of Latin at University College; in 1846–1849 he was reader in jurisprudence and civil law in the Middle Temple, and finally (1849–1871) classical lecturer at Brighton College. Subsequently, he lived in retirement at Portfield, Chichester, in receipt (from 1873) of a Civil List pension of £100 a year obtained for him by Gladstone.

He was one of the founders (1830), and for twenty years an officer, of the Royal Geographical Society; an active member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, for which he edited the quarterly &quot;Journal of Education&quot; (1831–1835) as well as many of its text-books; the editor (at first with Charles Knight, afterwards alone) of the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot; and of &quot;Knight&#x27;s Political Dictionary&quot;; and a member of the Society for Central Education instituted in London in 1837.

He contributed the Roman law articles to &quot;Smith&#x27;s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities&quot;, and wrote also for the companion dictionaries of Biography and Geography. He is remembered, however, mainly as the editor of the &quot;Bibliotheca Classica&quot; series—the first serious attempt to produce scholarly editions of classical texts with English commentaries—to which he contributed the edition of Cicero&#x27;s orations (1851–1862).

==Works==
Among his other works are:
*&quot;Summary of Herodotus&quot; (1829)
*edition of Herodotus (1830–1833)
*edition Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; (1831)
*revised editions of Rev Arthur Macleane&#x27;s Juvenal and Persius (1867) and Horace (1869)
*the &quot;Civil Wars of Rome&quot;
*a translation with Aubrey Stewart and notes of thirteen of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; (1844–1848)
*translation of the &quot;Meditations&quot; of Marcus Aurelius (1862)
*translation of the &quot;Discourses of Epictetus&quot; (1877)
*&quot;Decline of the Roman Republic&quot; (1864–1874), 5 vols
See HJ Matthews, in &quot;Memoriam&quot;, reprinted from the &quot;Brighton College Magazine&quot;, 1879.

== Family ==

During his time in Virginia, Long married Harriet Selden (nee Gray), the widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Selden, a judge of the Supreme Court of Arkansas. When the Longs returned to England in 1828, they took with them their Virginia-born slave, Jacob Walker. As slavery was no longer legal in England, Jacob is listed as a manservant on the 1841 census. The Longs had four children together, along with two daughters from Harriet&#x27;s previous marriage. Harriet died from cancer in 1841, and when Jacob Walker died two months later from smallpox following an inoculation, he was interred in the same grave, which is now listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England.

<text>Thomas Hewitt Key, FRS (20 March 179929 November 1875) was an English classical scholar.

==Life==

He was born in London and educated at St John&#x27;s and Trinity Colleges, Cambridge, and graduated 19th wrangler in 1821. From 1825 to 1827 he was the founding professor of Pure mathematics in the University of Virginia; Key owned at least one slave during his time there. After his return to England was appointed in 1828 professor of Latin in the newly founded University of London.

In 1832 he became joint headmaster of the school founded in connection with that institution (the University College School); in 1842 he resigned the professorship of Latin, and took up that of comparative grammar, together with the undivided headmastership of the school. These two posts he held until his death. A few years before his death, he also took the position of secretary to the College of Preceptors in London (later known as the College of Teachers).

Key is best known for his introduction of the crude-form (the uninflected form or stem of words) system, in general use among Sanskrit grammarians, into the teaching of the classical languages. This system was embodied in his &quot;Latin Grammar&quot; (1846). In &quot;Language, its Origin and Development&quot; (1874), he upheld the onomatopoeic theory.

Key was prejudiced against the German Sanskritists, and the etymological portion of his &quot;Latin Dictionary&quot;, published in 1888, was severely criticized on this account. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and president of the Philological Society, to the &quot;Transactions&quot; of which he contributed largely.

Key was the great-grandfather of British authors Rumer Godden and Jon Godden.

He was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="957474" wikidata="Q1607302" url="?curid=957474" title="Henry Taylor (dramatist)">
<text>Sir Henry Taylor (18 October 1800 – 27 March 1886) was an English dramatist and poet, Colonial Office official, and man of letters.

==Early life==
Henry Taylor was born on 18 October 1800 in Bishop Middleham. He was the third son of George Taylor Sr and Eleanor Ashworth, who died when he was an infant. His father remarried Jane Mills in 1818, and the family then moved to Witton-le-Wear. George Taylor Sr&#x27;s friend Charles Arbuthnot found vocational positions in London for Henry Taylor and his elder brother, George Taylor Jr. In 1817, the pair along with their second brother, William, a medical student, went to London. Soon afterwards, all three siblings contracted typhus fever, and both his brothers died within a fortnight. 

Following this tragedy, Henry Taylor then accepted work in the Colonial administration of Barbados. Taylor&#x27;s place in Barbados was abolished in 1820, subsequent to which he returned to his father&#x27;s house.

==At the Colonial Office==
Taylor obtained a clerkship in the Colonial Office, where he subsequently worked from 1824 until 1872, through Henry Holland. In this position Taylor served under the permanent secretary Robert William Hay. Taylor was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1869 Birthday Honours.

Hay&#x27;s successors included James Stephen, Herman Merivale and Frederic Rogers. Hay, Stephen, Taylor and James Spedding, who also worked in the Office, each proposed reform. During the 1830s, Taylor and Stephen endorsed the abolitionist contentions of Viscount Howick, as a consequence of which Stephen replaced Hay.

Taylor died on 27 March 1886.

==Literary connections==

Taylor wrote Byronic poems and an article on Thomas Moore, which in 1822 was accepted for the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; by William Gifford. Returning to London in October 1823, he found that Gifford had printed another article of his, on Lord John Russell. Taylor had also contributed to the &quot;London Magazine&quot;, and had an offer of the editorship.

His father George was a friend of William Wordsworth. In 1823, on a visit to the Lake District, Henry Taylor made the acquaintance of Robert Southey, and they became friends. Jane Taylor had a first cousin, Isabella Fenwick (1783–1856), whom he introduced to the Wordsworth family. She became a close friend of Wordsworth in later life, as she had been of Taylor up to the time of his marriage. Though Fenwick was not herself a writer, her friendship left an enduring impression on the writings of Taylor and Wordsworth. In his autobiography, Henry Taylor wrote, “There is a good deal of her mind in my writings. I wish there was more; and I wish that she had left her thoughts behind her in writings of her own.” 
Taylor&#x27;s work also brought him literary friends: the circle of Thomas Hyde Villiers, and his colleague James Stephen. Through Villiers he became acquainted with Charles Austin, John Stuart Mill, and some of the Benthamites. He made speeches in opposition to their views, in the debating society documented by Mill. He also invited them to personal meetings with Wordsworth and Southey. Mill introduced Taylor to Thomas Carlyle in November 1831, initiating a long friendship. Carlyle&#x27;s opinion of the &quot;marked veracity&quot; of Taylor was printed wrongly by the editor James Anthony Froude as &quot;morbid vivacity&quot;. He also knew John Sterling, and made the acquaintance of Fanny Trollope whilst attending the court of Louis Philippe of France.

Taylor aspired to become the official biographer of Southey. The family row over Southey&#x27;s second marriage, to Caroline Anne Bowles, found him with the Wordsworths and others hostile to Bowles. He did become Southey&#x27;s literary executor.

==Works==
In Witton, Taylor wrote &quot;The Cave of Ceada&quot; which was accepted for the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. Taylor wrote a number of plays, including &quot;Isaac Comnenus&quot; (1827), &quot;and Philip van Artevelde&quot; (1834). This latter brought him fame and elicited comparisons with Shakespeare. In 1845 there followed a book of lyrical poems. His essay &quot;The Statesman&quot; (1836) caused some controversy, as a &quot;supposedly&quot; satirical view of how the civil service worked.

Taylor published his &quot;Autobiography&quot; in 1885, which contains portraits of Wordsworth, Southey, Tennyson and Walter Scott. In it, on his own account, he gave Richard Whately&#x27;s opinion of him as a &quot;resuscitated Bacon&quot;, who had better things to do than write verse (which could be left to women).

His poem &quot;Edwin the Fair&quot; depicted Charles Elliot as Earl Athulf. Thomas Frederick Elliot, Charles&#x27;s brother, was a Colonial Office colleague.

==Literary reputation==
In his own time, Taylor was highly esteemed as a poet and dramatist. For example, J.G. Lockhart claimed that &quot;Philip Van Artevelde&quot; secured Taylor &quot;a place among the real artists of his time&quot;, and, as late as 1868, J.H. Stirling ranked &quot;Philip&quot; higher than anything produced by Robert Browning.

Modern literary historians, however, tend to overlook Taylor&#x27;s accomplishments in verse and drama and emphasize his importance as a literary critic, pointing out that he was a strong advocate for stylistic simplicity, subject matter rooted in common life, and intellectual discipline in poetic composition, placing special importance on clear and reasoned structure.

==Marriage and family==
Taylor married Hon. Theodosia Alice Spring Rice, daughter of Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon, on 17 October 1839. They had five children, including the biographer Ida Alice Ashworth Taylor.

<text>Walter Hugo Stockmayer (April 7, 1914, in Rutherford, New Jersey – May 9, 2004, in Norwich, Vermont) was an internationally known chemist and university teacher. A former member of the National Academy of Sciences, he was recognized as one of the twentieth century pioneers of polymer science. His specific interest was in theory and experiment for the structure and dynamics of polymer molecules, including various uses of the light scattering method.

Stockmayer became interested in the mathematical aspects of physical chemistry as an undergraduate at MIT. A Rhodes Scholarship brought him to Jesus College, Oxford, where he undertook gas kinetics research with D. L. Chapman. He introduced the Stockmayer potential.

Stockmayer returned to MIT for Ph.D. research and pursued his study of statistical mechanics, which he later continued at Columbia University. He returned again to MIT in 1943 to study the theory of network formation and the gelation criterion. Stockmayer increasingly directed his attention to theories of polymer solutions, light scattering and chain dynamics.

After a Guggenheim Fellowship for the academic year 1954/1955 in Strasbourg, France, he returned once more to MIT, then moved to Dartmouth College in 1961. There, he worked primarily on copolymers in dilute solution, established the journal &quot;Macromolecules&quot;, and collaborated with many Japanese scientists.

Stockmayer is mentioned as a friend of the author in the novel &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut, and is described as a distinguished pianist and a good skier. A fellowship in honor of Professor Stockmayer was established at Dartmouth College in 1994.

<text>Valentin Petrovich Glushko (; ; born 2 September 1908 – 10 January 1989) was a Soviet engineer who was program manager of the Soviet space program from 1974 until 1989. 

Glushko served as a main designer of rocket engines in the Soviet program during the heights of the Space Race between United States and the Soviet Union, and was the proponent of cybernetics within the space program.

==Biography==
Valentin Glushko was born on 2 September 1908 (21 August according to the old calendar) in Odesa to a Ukrainian cossack father and a Russian peasant mother.

At the age of fourteen he became interested in aeronautics after reading novels by Jules Verne. He is known to have written a letter to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1923. He studied at an Odessa trade school, where he learned to be a sheet metal worker. After graduation he apprenticed at a hydraulics fitting plant. He was first trained as a fitter, then moved to lathe operator.

During his time in Odessa, Glushko performed experiments with explosives. These were recovered from unexploded artillery shells that had been left behind by the White Guards during their retreat. From 1924 to 1925 he wrote articles concerning the exploration of the Moon, as well as the use of Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s proposed engines for space flight.

He attended Leningrad State University where he studied physics and mathematics, but found the specialty programs were not to his interest. He reportedly left without graduating in April, 1929. From 1929 to 1930 he pursued rocket research at the Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL), where a new research section was set up for the study of liquid-propellant and electric engines. He became a member of the Reactive Scientific Research Institute, founded in Moscow in 1931 when GDL merged with the Group for the Study of Reactive Motion (GIRD)

On 23 March 1938 he became caught up in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge and was rounded up by the NKVD, to be placed in the Butyrka prison. By 15 August 1939 he was sentenced to eight years imprisonment; however, Glushko was put to work on various aircraft projects with other arrested scientists. In 1941 he was placed in charge of a design bureau for liquid-fueled rocket engines. He was finally released in 1944. In 1944, Sergei Korolev and Glushko designed the RD-1 kHz auxiliary rocket motor tested in a fast-climb La-7R for protection of the capital from high-altitude &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attacks.

At the end of World War II, Glushko was sent to Germany and Eastern Europe to study the German rocket program. As part of this he attended an Operation Backfire launch as Colonel Glushko. In 1946, he became the chief designer of his own bureau, the OKB 456, and remained at this position until 1974. This bureau would play a prominent role in the development of rocket engines within the Soviet Union.

His OKB 456 (later NPO Energomash) would design the 35-metric ton (340 kN) thrust RD-101 engine used in the R-2, the 120-ton (1,180 kN) thrust RD-110 employed in the R-3, and the 44-ton (430 kN) thrust RD-103 used in the R-5 Pobeda (SS-3 Shyster). The R-7 (&quot;Semyorka&quot;) would include four of Glushko&#x27;s RD-107 engines and one RD-108. In 1954, he began to design engines for the R-12 Dvina (SS-4 Sandal), which had been designed by Mikhail Yangel. He also became responsible for supplying rocket engines for Sergei Korolev, the designer of the R-9 Desna (SS-8 Sasin). Among his designs was the powerful RD-170 liquid propellant engine.

In 1974, following the six successful American Moon landings, premier Leonid Brezhnev decided to cancel the troubled Soviet program to send a man to the Moon. He consolidated the Soviet space program, moving Vasily Mishin&#x27;s OKB-1 (Korolev&#x27;s former design bureau), as well as other bureaus, into a single bureau headed by Glushko, later named NPO Energia. Glushko&#x27;s first act, after firing Mishin altogether, was to cancel the N-1 rocket, a program he had long criticized, despite the fact that one of the reasons for its difficulties was his own refusal to design the high-power engines Korolev needed because of friction between the two men and ostensibly a disagreement over the use of cryogenic or hypergolic fuel.

In 1965, after the UR-500 booster began flying, the Chelomei Bureau offered a counterproposal to Korolev&#x27;s N-1 in the UR-700, a Saturn V-class booster with nine F-1 sized engines powered by dinitrogen tetroxide and UDMH. Korolev was an outspoken opponent of hypergolic propellants due to their toxicity, often citing the 1960 Nedelin catastrophe as evidence of the danger posed by them, and had also objected to the UR-500 for the same reason.

Glushko meanwhile was an advocate of Vladimir Chelomei&#x27;s UR-700 as well as an even more powerful UR-900 with a nuclear-powered upper stage. When Korolev continued protesting about the safety risk posed by hypergolic propellants, Glushko responded with the counterargument that the US was launching the crewed Gemini spacecraft atop a Titan II rocket with very similar propellants and it was not a safety issue for them. He also argued that the N-1 was not a workable solution because they could not develop RP-1/LOX engines on the scale of the Saturn F-1. When Korolev suggested developing a liquid hydrogen engine for the N-1, Glushko said that LH2 was completely impractical as a rocket fuel.

The UR-700, Glushko said, could enable a direct-ascent trajectory to the Moon, which he considered safer and more reliable than the rendezvous-and-dock approach used by the Apollo program and Korolev&#x27;s N-1 proposals. He also imagined the UR-700 and 900 in all sorts of applications, from lunar bases to crewed Mars missions to outer planet probes to orbiting battle stations.

When Korolev died in January 1966, his deputy Vasily Mishin took over the OKB-1 design bureau. Mishin succeeded in getting the Kremlin to terminate the UR-700/900 project and the RD-270 engine Glushko planned for the launch vehicle family. His main arguments were the tremendous safety risk posed by a low-altitude launch failure of the UR-700 and the waste of money by developing two heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLV) families at once.

After the complete failure of the Soviet crewed lunar effort, uncrewed Mars missions, and the deaths of four cosmonauts, Mishin was fired in 1973 and the Kremlin decided to consolidate the entire Soviet space program into one organization headed by Glushko.

One of Glushko&#x27;s first acts was to suspend the N-1 program, which, however, was not formally terminated until 1976. He then began work on a completely new HLV. During this time, the US was developing the Space Shuttle.

Glushko decided that the new HLV, Energia, would use entirely liquid-fueled engines, with an LH2 core stage taking the place of the Shuttle main engines, and the Shuttle&#x27;s solid-propellant strap-on boosters with liquid boosters using LOX/RP-1 RD-170 engines.

While the RD-120 engine used for the Energia core stage was developed quickly and with little difficulty, the RD-170 proved harder to work out. Glushko instead decided to use an engine with four combustion chambers fed from a single propellant feed line. The RD-170 powered strap-on boosters designed for Energia became the basis for the Zenit booster family which began flying in 1985. Since the Buran space shuttle was not ready for operations, Energia&#x27;s maiden flight in May 1987 carried aloft a prototype space station module called Polyus. Ultimately, Buran did fly the following summer, a few months before Glushko&#x27;s death.

While Energia and Buran fell victim to loss of funding after the collapse of the USSR, the RD-170 engines and its derivatives are still flying today and the experience in LH2 engines made during the Energia project would be used in later upper stages such as Briz.

Glushko&#x27;s team was part of the Soviet Ministry of General Machine Building headed by Minister Sergey Afanasyev. Before his death, he appointed Boris Gubanov to become his successor.

Glushko died on January 10, 1989. His obituary was signed by multiple Communist Party of the Soviet Union leaders, including Mikhail Gorbachev. He was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

His most significant engineering failure, as noted by division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen fuel was unsuitable for use as a rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing using hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko&#x27;s design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F-1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic propellants which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse when compared to the F-1 engine. In addition, the RD-270 used the very advanced full-flow, staged, closed-cycle combustion concept instead of the simple open-cycle gas generator design used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N-1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion since Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket engines using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia super heavy-lift launch vehicle, and is probably the finest example of Glushko&#x27;s technical abilities when he was at his best.

<text>Chelsea is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 30 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Chelsea recorded a population of 8,347 at the .

Chelsea is located on Port Phillip and is the most important bayside suburban centre between Mordialloc and Frankston. Chelsea is very popular with beachgoers during summer. Also popular is Bicentennial Park, located about 1 km inland on the site of a former rubbish tip. It has recently been redeveloped with modern barbecue and play equipment, most notably the Mount Chelsea adventure playground.

The Frankston railway line first cut through the Chelsea area in 1882 and Chelsea station was opened during 1907, as was the Chelsea Post Office. These facilities served a modest slowly growing population before most of the Chelsea area was developed post-World War II. Many houses were demolished to make way for single storey units in the 1960s and 1970s. Chelsea has smaller households, fewer families with children and more elderly people than most other Melbourne suburbs.

The Chelsea Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985.

Chelsea has its own railway station on the Frankston line.

Chelsea is also home to many church, community and sporting organisations. The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League. AFL legend Leigh Matthews played his junior football at the Chelsea Football Club.

Golfers play at the Australasian Golf Club&#x27;s Chelsea Public Golf Course on Fraser Avenue in neighbouring Edithvale.

Chelsea Yacht Club provides competitive sailing and was formed in 1938.

<text>The Ancestor&#x27;s Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life is a science book by Richard Dawkins and Yan Wong that delves into the topic of evolution. The book adopts a unique approach, retracing the path of humans in reverse chronological order through evolutionary history. Along the way, it introduces readers to various species, referred to as humanity&#x27;s cousins, as they converge on shared common ancestors. Drawing on scientific principles and research, &quot;The Ancestor&#x27;s Tale&quot; offers an accessible and thought-provoking exploration of life&#x27;s origins and the intricate relationships that connect all living beings.

==Synopsis==
The book follows a path backwards in time through evolution and meets different groupings of organisms. In this backward chronology, the ancestors of any set of species must eventually meet at a particular moment. The last common ancestor is the one that they all share which the authors call a &quot;concestor&quot;. The oldest concestor, LUCA, short for Last Universal Common Ancestor, is the ancestor of all surviving life forms on Earth. The evidence for this is that all organisms share the same genetic code and it is not thought that this code was invented twice. There is no sign of other independent origins of life, and as the book explains, if new life did now arise, its organisms would probably be quickly eaten by existing lifeforms.

&quot;The Ancestor&#x27;s Tale&quot; follows what it calls a &quot;pilgrimage&quot;, to discover our ancestors and meet other &quot;pilgrims&quot; (i.e. groups of species) who join as the book reaches a common ancestor that humanity shares with them. The reader reads of 40 rendezvous before hitting the origin of life itself.

The book&#x27;s structure is inspired by Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s late-14th century work &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; and its pilgrims. For instance, how new species come about, how the axolotl never needs to mature, how hard it is to classify animals, and why our fish-like ancestors moved to the land.

==Concestors==
The authors use the term &quot;concestor&quot;, coined by Nicky Warren, for the most recent common ancestor at each rendezvous point. At each rendezvous point, we meet the concestor of ourselves and the listed species or collection of species. The concestor does not have to have been much like those creatures. After the &quot;rendezvous&quot;, our fellow &quot;pilgrims&quot; have had as much time to evolve and change as we have. Along the way, the authors introduce new pilgrims who join us on the trip backwards through time.

==Chapters==
===Prologue===
===Primates===

=== Non-primate mammals ===
===Non-mammal chordates===

===Non-chordate animals===

From the lancelets onward, the authors provide dates under duress stating that &quot;dating becomes so difficult and controversial that my courage fails me&quot;.

=== Non-animal eukaryotes ===

There are essential differences between the 1st and 2nd editions of the book in this section. Another rendezvous has been added (#33), and the unknown rendezvous has been partially resolved.

===Great Historic Rendezvous===
This is a significantly shorter section in the second edition. The authors describe the critical beginnings of eukaryotic cells and describe the endosymbiotic theory proposed by Lynn Margulis.

=== Prokaryotes ===
Prokaryotes can move genetic material between unicellular and multicellular organisms other than by the (&quot;vertical&quot;) transmission of DNA from parent to offspring by way of horizontal gene transfer.

===Origin of life===
The authors elaborate at length about the possible origins of life through the RNA world, enterobacteria phage Qbeta, the Miller–Urey experiment, Spiegelman&#x27;s Monster and the possible hypercycle of DNA, RNA, and enzymes which work together to support each other in a primordial world.

==Reception==
On Metacritic, the book received a 82 out of 100 based on 14 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In the January/February 2005 issue of &quot;Bookmarks&quot;, the book was scored four out of five. The magazine&#x27;s critical summary reads: &quot;Overall, it’s a grand celebration of life on earth&quot;.

Carl Zimmer of the &quot;New York Times&quot; stated that the book is one of the best to understand evolutionary trees.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; thought it was awkward to move backward in time starting from humans and thought this required linguistic gymnastics with new definitions of before and after a certain evolutionary point. Matt Ridley at &quot;The Guardian&quot; liked the approach of a Chaucer Pilgrim traveling backwards and the perspective of not seeing other animals as failures.

<text>USS &quot;Stribling&quot; (DD-96) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and the years following. She was the first ship named in honor of Cornelius Stribling.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Stribling&quot; was laid down at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 14 December 1917 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company. The ship was launched on 29 May 1918, sponsored by Miss Mary Calvert Stribling. The destroyer was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 16 August 1918.

==Service history==
On 31 August 1918, &quot;Stribling&quot; departed New York to escort a convoy across the Atlantic Ocean. However, machinery trouble forced her back into New York the following day. After almost three weeks in port, she got underway again on 18 September 1918, this time as an escort to a Gibraltar-bound convoy. She fueled at Ponta Delgada in the Azores and made Gibraltar in early October 1918. From there, she sailed with a convoy for Marseilles on 10 October 1918. For the next month, she made several Gibraltar-to-Marseilles circuits with Allied convoys.

After the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I, &quot;Stribling&quot; steamed to Venice, Italy, to investigate post-armistice conditions there and at various other ports on Italy&#x27;s Adriatic coast and in Dalmatia. At the completion of that duty, she headed back to the United States, arriving home in July 1919. &quot;Stribling&quot; entered the Portsmouth Navy Yard for and repairs before being placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia. There, she was converted to a light minelayer and, on 17 July 1920, she was redesignated DM-1.

In September 1921, she departed Philadelphia and teamed to the United States West Coast and, from there, proceeded on to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. After a series of maneuvers in the Hawaiian Islands, &quot;Stribling&quot; was decommissioned on 26 June 1922. On 1 December 1936, her name was struck from the Navy list. The following month, her hulk was towed to San Pedro, California, where she was sunk as a target in January 1937.

<doc id="957533" wikidata="Q7148453" url="?curid=957533" title="Patterson Lakes, Victoria">
<text>Patterson Lakes is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Patterson Lakes recorded a population of 7,793 at the 2021 census.

Patterson Lakes is a canal-rich suburb. It was built around the lower section of the Patterson River just upstream of the river mouth. The suburb consists predominantly of new housing developments, and is home to popular boat launching facilities. The Patterson River is a popular boating portal for Port Phillip Bay. It includes four public launching ramps; joins the Tidal Canal system to Port Phillip; and includes the Patterson Lakes Marina and its facilities in Middle Harbour and Inner Harbour.

==History==
===Early history===
After the melting of the last great ice age, sea levels were 1–2 metres higher than today. When sea levels subsided to their current levels, fresh water from the Dandenong Ranges flowed into low-lying regions. Carrum Carrum Swamp, an extensive coastal wetland, was created, encompassing an area some 5,000 hectares from present-day Mordialloc to Frankston and inland towards Dandenong.

Prior to European discovery, the Patterson Lakes area was populated by Indigenous Australians known as the Kulin people. Inhabitants in the area were from the Bunurong language group, of the Mayone-Bulluk clan. 
Both the Mayone-Bulluk and Ngaruk-Willam clans would meet in the area of Dandenong often to hold ceremonies and trade. These gatherings were often attended by guests from other Bunurong clans or from neighbouring tribes, such as the Wathaurung and the Wurundjeri clans from the Woiwurong. As with most indigenous people of the world, Mayone-Bulluk cultural, ceremonial and spiritual life was dictated by the seasonal availability of natural resources. Through thousands of years of observation Bunurong People were able to predict the availability of their seasonal resources by certain changes in plant growth and animal behaviour.

Europeans first set foot in nearby Frankston as early as 1803, thirty-two years before the founding of Melbourne (the first major European settlement in the then Port Phillip District). A commemorative plaque near the mouth of Kananook Creek marks the location of where Charles Grimes and his party went ashore searching for fresh water, and met with approximately 30 local inhabitants.

===The foundation of Patterson Lakes===
Early development was hampered by poor soils, distance from the Melbourne city centre, and the existence of a major swamp occupying much of the area between Mordialloc and Seaford.

In 1866 the Carrum Carrum Swamp was surveyed and the land between Mordialloc Creek and Keast Park in Seaford was divided into 18 allotments and sold by auction for around three pounds per acre. In 1871 the government opened it for selection. The swamp was an impediment to the settlers and there was much discussion on how to reclaim the land, the first contracts for drainage works commenced in 1873. Attempts to reclaim the lower swamplands were ineffective. In 1876 it was decided to cut a 10-metre wide channel to Port Phillip Bay. It was to be known as &#x27;Patterson Cut&#x27; and had been named after a State Parliamentarian and commissioner for public works - Sir James Brown Patterson.
In 1876 the area that is now occupied by Patterson Lakes was owned by Kate and Henry Woodward,(HRW Woodward and Sons) who used the area for holding pastures for livestock. In the early 1970s some 200 acres of this area was subdivided by the Woodward family into Melbourne&#x27;s first subdivision around artificial lakes.
Other occupants of the area were the Priestly family who had landholdings either side of the Patterson River and ran a marina just east of what is now Pier One Drive.
The Fitzgerald family ran a horse riding centre on the north-east corner of Thompsons Road and Old Wells Road on land that is now owned by Melbourne Water.
The Walker family also owned some of the southernmost land bordering Eel Race Creek at one stage.

The suburb of Patterson Lakes was to be located in Carrum on what was originally part of the Carrum Carrum Swamp. The Carrum Carrum Swamp was drained in 1879 when the Patterson Cut, and other drainage measures were undertaken to prevent flooding of the Eumemmering Creek, which overflowed into the Carrum Carrum Swamp. The mouth of the Patterson Cut was mostly only open during the winter months, so heavy spring and summer rains often caused flooding to properties on the edge of the swamp area. Flood damage as far north as Edithvale often occurred. The only remnants of the Carrum Carrum Swamp now form the Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands (a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance.)

===The Carrum Cowboys===
The Carrum Cowboys were a group of teenagers, who rode their horses around Carrum and the surrounding areas in the late 1950s and 1960s. The name was a tag given to the group by the local police. The Cowboys rode on footpaths and were often riding too fast at the beach, which would lead to a number of complaints from local residents. On several occasions members of the Cowboys were pursued by police, which led to court action and fines being imposed. The over 50s AFL team for Patterson Lakes and Carrum is called the Carrum Cowboys.

===The development of Patterson Lakes===
The decision to go ahead with what was originally going to be called Gladesville took place in 1973.
The development of residential areas adjacent to canals and waterways had been carried out successfully in many places. No-one had attempted to do this in Victoria unlike in other states. When Len Woodward looked closely at the land adjoining the Patterson River, he saw the possibility of a development. If it proved to be feasible and practicable, it would give home owners access to Port Phillip from their &quot;back door&quot;.
A large part of the area to the east of Carrum had flooded in the 1930s and 1950s, but to the engineers investigating the land, the important issues were why this occurred and how it could be prevented from occurring again. A common misconception was that the area was all swamp and mud. Extensive drilling found that only a surface layer of peat-like material was unsuitable. Underneath this layer was fine dense sand. The engineers realised that once the unsuitable material was removed (and used to strengthen levee banks and create landscaped areas and reserves) they would then be able to excavate to form lakes and canals, and use the excavated sand in forming residential sites. By using this fine, dense, carefully compacted sand, all the proposed residential sites would be brought to a level above that required by the authorities.
The first soil was turned in 1974 in the north-east corner of Patterson Lakes around Iluka Island (Lake Legana.) Originally the plans were to build high rise towers of up to 15 stories in height.
Patterson Lakes was rezoned from rural to residential.
Central sites were planned for a shopping centre and for a marina which would have a second access to the river via flood gates. Sites for housing and apartments overlooking the marina and the river were identified. Sites for a primary school and for community facilities were also incorporated into the overall plan. Also the project was &quot;different&quot;, in that more than a hundred non-lake, residential sites were created to further the concept of a new community having a mix of socio-economic groups.

===Regions===
Lake Carramar, Lake Illawong and Lake Legana, collectively known as the Quiet Lakes, are three interconnected (via pumps and underground drains) but tidally isolated ponds at the suburb&#x27;s northern neighbourhoods. The canal system that runs through most of Patterson Lakes is known as the Tidal Canal. Landmarks inside the Tidal Canal region include Clipper Island, Mariners Island, Staten Island, Rhode Island, Barellen Harbours and Schooner Bay.

Other landmarks of Patterson Lakes include Wannarkladdin Wetlands, Patterson River and Eel Race Drain (later becomes the Kananook Creek.) The Patterson Lakes Marina has facilities at the Town Centre (Inner Harbour), Runaway Bay (Middle Harbour) and Whaler&#x27;s Cove (Western Harbour). The
Patterson River is managed by Parks Victoria, while the Tidal Canal system and the Quiet Lakes are managed by Melbourne Water.

===Climate===
Patterson Lakes has a temperate climate similar to that of Melbourne, however it is usually 2°C cooler than the Melbourne CBD. In many cases, Patterson Lakes is one of the first suburbs of the Greater Melbourne area to feel the effect of the cool weather change that occurs during the summer season.

===Fishing===
The Patterson River abounds with fish. Considered that there have been several reports of illegal fishing over the last few years, the fish always seem to fight back in this popular waterway. A number of charter companies operate from Patterson River. Bream and a few other varieties of fish can be sourced from the Tidal Canal and Patterson River systems.

<doc id="957537" wikidata="Q3621850" url="?curid=957537" title="Richard Butler (white supremacist)">
<text>Richard Girnt Butler (February 23, 1918 – September 8, 2004) was an American engineer and neo-Nazi. After dedicating himself to the Christian Identity movement, a racist offshoot of British Israelism, Butler founded the National Socialist Aryan Nations and would become the &quot;spiritual godfather&quot; to the white separatist movement, in which he was a leading figure. He has been described as a &quot;notorious racist&quot;.

==Life and ideological career==
Butler was born in Bennett, Colorado, the only child to Winifred Girnt and Clarence Butler. His father was of English ancestry, while his mother was of German-English ancestry. He was raised in Los Angeles, California beginning in 1931, and after graduating from high school in 1938, he became an aeronautical engineering major at Los Angeles City College. He was a co-inventor of the rapid repair of tubeless tires.

Butler was a member of the Silver Shirts, an American fascist organization modeled on the Nazi Brownshirts, which was active until its suppression following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

While he was a member of a Presbyterian church, he married Betty Litch in 1941, with whom he fathered two daughters. Litch died on December 1, 1995. After Pearl Harbor, Butler enlisted in the Army Air Corps where he served stateside for the duration of World War II. During this time, he said he developed an admiration for Hitler.

In 1946, Butler organized and operated a machine plant for the production and precision machining of automotive parts and engine assemblies for commercial and military aircraft in the United States, Africa, and India. Butler was a marketing analyst for new inventions from 1964 to 1973. He later became a senior manufacturing engineer for Lockheed Martin in Palmdale, California.

In the 1960s, Butler lived in Whittier, California. He collaborated with William Potter Gale and Wesley Swift in the California Committee to Combat Communism. The three men later founded the Christian Defense League in 1964. Butler served as the organization&#x27;s executive director and ran the organization out of his Whittier home. Both organizations promoted white supremacy and antisemitism under the guise of preserving American heritage and opposing communism. He also lived in Montebello, California.

In the early 1970s, he moved with his family from Palmdale, California, to North Idaho, where he founded the Aryan Nations, a wing of the Church of Jesus Christ–Christian, whose ideology is a mixture of Christian Identity and Nazism. The organization operated from a compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho, a suburb of the tourist town Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, which became the center of a Neo-Nazi network with worldwide links. Beginning in the 1980s, Butler was implicated in plots to overthrow the United States government, and he had ties to the neo-Nazi group known as The Order. His group often blanketed the community with fliers and mass mailings, and held an annual parade in downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene; however, the group was condemned by the town of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, and locals responded almost immediately by forming the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, with legal battles often overshadowing the parades.

Butler organized yearly gatherings of white supremacists at his compound in Idaho which he termed the &quot;Aryan Nations World Congress.&quot; At their height in 1984–86, several hundred people would attend including most of the well known leaders of the American far right, such as Klansman Louis Beam, White Aryan Resistance leader Tom Metzger, Gordon &quot;Jack&quot; Mohr, Robert E. Miles, Posse Comitatus leader James Wickstrom, Thomas Robb, Grand Wizard Don Black, and John Trochmann, the leader of the Militia of Montana.

In 1987, Butler was among fourteen far right activists indicted for seditious conspiracy by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of the Fort Smith sedition trial. Their trial was held at a federal court in Arkansas. However, &quot;prosecutors failed to convince an Arkansas jury that Butler and several other prominent racists had conspired to start a race war.&quot;

In 2000, Victoria and Jason Keenan, a Native American mother and son who were harassed at gunpoint by Aryan Nations&#x27; members, successfully sued Butler. Represented by local attorney Norm Gissel and Morris Dees&#x27;s Montgomery, Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, they won a combined civil judgment of $6.3 million from Butler and the Aryan Nations members who attacked them. The couple also received his compound, which they later donated to North Idaho College, who turned it into &quot;Peace Park&quot;. In September 2000, fellow Sandpoint, Idaho millionaire Vincent Bertollini provided Butler with a new house in Hayden, Idaho. The house was troublesome for neighbors; police were forced to respond to at least one domestic disturbance call, in which two Aryan Nations members were engaged in an altercation on his lawn.

Butler&#x27;s 2002 World Congress drew fewer than 100 people, and when he ran for mayor of Hayden against incumbent Ron McIntire, he lost by 2,100 votes to 50.

Butler died in his home on September 8, 2004. A spokesman for Aryan Nations stated that he died in his sleep from congestive heart failure. At the time of his death, Aryan Nations had 200 members.

<text>Kim Hyong-jik (; 10 July 1894 – 5 June 1926) was a Korean independence activist during Japanese rule. He was the father of the North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, the paternal grandfather of Kim Jong Il, and a great-grandfather of the current leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.

==Biography==
Little is known about Kim. Born on 10 July 1894, in the small village of Mangyongdae, situated atop a peak called Mangyungbong (만경봉(萬景峰),&quot;All-Seeing Peak&quot;) just 12 kilometers downstream on the Taedong River from Pyongyang, Kim was the son of Kim Pohyŏn (1871–1955). Kim attended Sungshil School (), which was run by American missionaries, and became a teacher at the Sunhwa school () in Mangyongdae in 1913 and the Christian Myongsin school () in Ponghwa-ri, Kangdong County in 1916 and later worked as a herbal pharmacist. According to the North Korean official sources, he died as a result of numerous medical problems, including third-degree frostbite.

Kim and his wife attended Christian churches, and Kim even served as a part-time Protestant missionary. It was reported that his son, Kim Il Sung, attended church services during his teenage years before becoming an atheist later in life.

Kim Il Sung often spoke of his father&#x27;s idea of &quot;chiwŏn&quot; (지원(志遠), righteous aspirations).

Kim Jong Il&#x27;s official government biography states that his grandfather was &quot;the leader of the anti-Japanese national liberation movement and was a pioneer in shifting the direction from the nationalist movement to the communist movement in Korea&quot;. Kim Hyong-jik is claimed by North Korea to have convened an important meeting of independence activists in November, 1921 memorialized at the Sansong Revolutionary Site.

<text>The Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) is an annual film festival held over three weeks in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was founded in 1952 and is one of the oldest film festivals in the world following the founding of the Venice Film Festival in 1932, Cannes Film Festival in 1939 and Berlin Film Festival in 1951. 

Currently held in the month of August from 8th to 25th in 2024 and spanning events in the Melbourne CBD as well as inner-suburban and regional Victoria, MIFF screens films from both Australia and across the world to an audience of approximately 150,000. It is the largest film festival in both Australia and the Southern Hemisphere, and is the world’s largest showcase of new Australian cinema. The 2022 festival contributed A$9.7 million to the City of Melbourne’s economy.

Alongside its expansive and well-received film program, MIFF realizes its vision, “An enlightened, inclusive, engaged society through film”, via its renowned industry programs (the co-financing fund Premiere Fund, the talent incubator program Accelerator Lab and the film-financing market 37°South), its skill-building initiatives for youth (MIFF Schools and Critics Campus), and the MIFF Awards that recognize both short- and longform filmmaking talent.

==History==
MIFF was originally launched as the Olinda Film Festival in 1952 after a group of delegates to the 1951 Australian Council of Film Societies suggested that a film event be established in the eponymous tourist town. It was renamed the Melbourne Film Festival in 1953 and held this title over many decades before transforming into the Melbourne International Film Festival. Appointed in 1956, Erwin Rado was the festival’s first director, holding the role until 1979 and returning for a single-year stint in 1983; the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; notes that he shaped the film event’s character with his “uncompromising drive for excellence”. 

Following Rado, the festival was headed up by Geoffrey Gardner (1980–1982), Paul Seto (1984), Paul Coulter (1985), Santina Musumeci (1986–1987), Tait Brady (1988–1996), Sandra Sdraulig (1997–2000), James Hewison (2001–2006), Richard Moore (2007–2010), Michelle Carey (2011–2018) and current artistic director Al Cossar (2019–present).

==Film program==

MIFF’s annual program boasts around 300 titles spanning feature films, short films and XR (virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality), alongside a suite of galas, special events, activations and talks. In 2022, the festival screened 260 features, 111 shorts, 12 XR works, and 10 galas and special events, representing 82 countries of origin and 75 languages.

==Film competitions==
MIFF’s short film competition, established in 1962, is accredited by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts. Its inaugural award was ‘Best Short Film’, but the title was changed to ‘Grand Prix for Best Short Film’ in 1965. Since 1985, the Grand Prix has been presented by the City of Melbourne.

In 2022, this was complemented by a feature-length competition for first- and second-time directors, the Bright Horizons Award (presented by VicScreen), whose winner receives a A$140,000 prize; as well as the Blackmagic Design Australian Innovation Award, which recognizes an outstanding Australian creative with a A$70,000 cash prize. As of 2023, the MIFF Awards slate has been expanded to also include the First Nations Film Creative Award, which recognizes an outstanding Indigenous Australian creative with a prize worth $45,000; the Audience Award, as decided by public voting; and the MIFF Schools Youth Jury Award, crowning the best title from the student-focused MIFF Schools program.

The Shorts Awards are all accredited by Academy Awards, and the 2023 winners of the Best Short Film, Best Australian Short Film, Best Documentary Short Film, and Best Animation Short Film awards were eligible to submit their films for the 96th Academy Awards in 2024. The MIFF Shorts program is also BAFTA-Qualifying; any British film screened in the 2023 festival was eligible for entry in the British Short Film and British Short Animation categories of the 2024 BAFTA Film Awards.

===Winners of Grand Prix for Best Short Film===
==Controversies==
===Breakaway film festival (2000)===
In 2000, MIFF&#x27;s rejection of a feature film written and directed by Richard Wolstencroft led him to form the Melbourne Underground Film Festival (MUFF). In subsequent years, MUFF has attracted controversy by criticising the content of MIFF, as well as its management, specifically the leadership of former directors. MUFF sees itself as a space for exciting and edgy Australian cinema that may not be played at MIFF.

===&quot;Looking for Eric&quot; (2009)===
In June 2009, Ken Loach, Paul Laverty (writer) and Rebecca O&#x27;Brien (producer) pulled their film &quot;Looking for Eric&quot; from the festival because the Israeli Embassy was a sponsor and the festival declined to withdraw their sponsorship. Moore compared Loach&#x27;s tactics to blackmail, stating that &quot;we will not participate in a boycott against the State of Israel, just as we would not contemplate boycotting films from China or other nations involved in difficult long-standing historical disputes&quot;.

===Uyghur film (2009)===
During the 58th festival in 2009, the film &quot;The 10 Conditions of Love&quot; (2009), which documents the life of the exiled Uyghur leader Rebiya Kadeer, was screened despite many attempts by the Government of China to have the film withdrawn from the festival. Chinese filmmakers withdrew their films from the festival two days before it opened on 24 July 2009. Former MIFF director Richard Moore refused to remove the film from the festival program, despite the hacking of the festival website and attempts to hack its online ticketing system from IP addresses of Chinese origin. Later, both pro-Chinese and pro-Uyghur activists attempted to disrupt ticketing due to the media coverage. The Chinese Government contacted Robert Doyle, the Lord Mayor of Melbourne asking him to intervene, but he refused. Australia&#x27;s Ambassador to China Geoff Raby was summoned by China&#x27;s Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun to express displeasure about Kadeer&#x27;s attendance at MIFF.

Victoria Police was placed on alert during the screening of the film and Pro-Uighur demonstrators also gathered outside the Melbourne Town Hall, and the Dalai Lama sent a message of support via Michael Danby, the MP for Melbourne Ports:

<text>Rome Laboratory (Rome Air Development Center until 1991) is a U.S. Air Force research laboratory for &quot;command, control, and communications&quot; research and development and is responsible for planning and executing the USAF science and technology program.

==Organization==
Rome Lab includes or included the following entities:
;Information Directorate: The Information Directorate develops information technologies for air, space and ground systems, partnering with other federal agencies, allied nations, state and local governments, and more than 50 major universities. The Rome Laboratory Technical Library is located at 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY.

;Sensors Directorate: Moved to Wright-Patterson AFB under the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission

Divisions and laboratories of the former Rome Air Development Center (RADC) included the Electronic Warfare Laboratory, High Power Laboratory, Photonics Laboratory, 1968 Electronics Laboratory (dedicated 25 October), RADC Systems Division, and the Communications and Control Division which moved from building 106 to building 3 in March 1976. (RADC computer facilities were in bldg 3, which in August 1974 had &quot;a new $2.8 million communications research laboratory&quot;.)

==History==
The Rome Air Depot established 5 February 1942 built USAAF versions of the Norden bombsights and tested/rebuilt large airplane engines, and Army Air Field, Rome, was established as a WWII USAAF airfield in New York on 4 Nov 1942. World War II technical squadrons included the &quot;600 Engrg Sq&quot; (10 Oct 44-30 Oct 44) and the &quot;1 Acft Assembly Sq&quot; (21 Aug 45-6 Nov 45). Renamed Griffiss Air Force Base on 23 Jan 1948, the World War II installation&#x27;s buildings were used as post-war offices and laboratories, e.g., for testing units that arrived beginning in 1948 from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Middletown Air Depot (Griffiss had the &quot;2 Msl Trpt Sq&quot; 26 Jan 48-3 Sep 48.)

The 3171st Electronics Research Group activated on 12 January 1949 under the 2751st Experimental Wing formed during World War II, and the 3180th Weapon Equipment Flight Test organization activated on 4 April 1949. On September 26, 1950, the Griffiss AFB Air Force Electronics Center was established—2 Griffiss radar units were established on 12 Oct 50 for less than a year, the 7th and 12th Radar Calibration Units. The entire Watson Laboratories, which was acquiring the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; Bendix AN/FPS-3 Radar for Air Defense Command, transferred to Griffiss from Camp Coles NJ, from 6 November 1950 until 2 April 1951, the date Griffiss AFB transferred to Air Research and Development Command. During the move the 3151st Electronics Group was activated on 14 March 1951.

===RADC===
The &quot;Rome Air Development Center&quot; headquarters officially opened on June 12, 1951, with the personnel of the headquarters for the 2751st Wing and 3171st &amp; 3151st groups, which were &quot;discontinued&quot;—the 6530th Air Base Wing with subordinate units, e.g., Maintenance and Support Group, activated on the same date for support through August/November 1952. RADC was for USAF &quot;applied research, development and test of electronic air-ground systems such as detection, control, identification and countermeasures, navigation, communications, and data transmission systems, associated components, and related automatic flight equipment&quot;. RADC constructed the Forestport Tower in 1951 for low-frequency communications experiments. On 1 January 1953, RADC reorganized into the Engineering Support Division, Electronic Warfare
and Techniques Division, Equipment Development Division, and Systems Division (a Plans and Operations Office at the HQ provided guidance.)

For ATC and SAC to score bombing accuracy, and based on the AN/MPQ-2; RADC integrated AN/MPS-9 radars with RBS plotting to create the AN/MSQ-1 (with OA-132 plotting computer/board)) and AN/MSQ-2 (OA-215)—RADC also developed SAC&#x27;s &quot;AN/GSA-19 Blanking System&quot; for safety at RBS radar stations. RADC began using a new intelligence and reconnaissance laboratory building on 27 May 1954, and an AN/GPA-37 &quot;developed by RADC [and] installed at the Verona Test Site&quot; conducted a 28 December 1955 ground-controlled interception test &quot;on an F-86D fighter interceptor aircraft&quot;. Also in 1955 RADC developed phased array radar technology, and the center contracted Bendix&#x27;s Radio Division in 1958 to build the Bendix AN/FPS-46 Electronically Steerable Array Radar (ESAR) for demonstration (1st &quot;powered up&quot; in November 1960.)

A prototype AN/FPS-43 BMEWS radar completed at Trinidad in 1958 went operational on February 4, 1959, the date of an Atlas IIB firing from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 11 (lunar reflection was tested January–June 1960.) On 20 January 1960 RADC accepted the Avco AN/FPS-26 Frequency Diversity Radar from Avco for use at SAGE radar stations (later modified into the 474N &quot;Fuzzy-7&quot; SLBM Detection Radar.)

====AFCCDD assignment====
On 1 July 1960, RADC was assigned to the Air Force Command and Control Development Division and , RADC conducted an &quot;Experimental Passive-Satellite Communication Link&quot; using the ECHO satellite and Philco terminals for reflecting voice transmissions through space from the Trinidad Space Communication Facility (with &quot;BMEWS type radar tracker&quot; using &quot;AN/FRC-56 type&quot; transmitter and &quot;84FT DISH&quot;) to the &quot;RADC Floyd Site&quot;. In August 1962, RADC established the &quot;AFLC Communications-Electronics Field Office&quot; to monitor missile tests.

A &quot;60-foot-diameter&quot; antenna at the Floyd site built by RADC &quot;particularly to communicate with ECHO II&quot; was dedicated on 30 August 1963. In 1965 based on the USMC AN/MPQ-14, the &quot;SKYSPOT RADC developmental program&quot; designed the AN/MSQ-77 with ballistic computer for Vietnam War high-altitude, low-visibility (e.g., nighttime, inclement weather) strategic bombing missions, and which was also used as a &quot;Close Air Support Bombing System&quot;.

====RTD assignment====
By June 1965, RADC was assigned to AFSC&#x27;s Research and Technology Division and had a Communications Research Branch (an early 1960s plan to rename RADC to the Air Force Electromagnetics Laboratory was not implemented.) RADC&#x27;s Program 673A research resulted in the 440L System Program Office for the Forward Scatter Over-the-Horizon network (AN/FRT-80 transmitters &amp; AN/FSQ-76 receivers) being established on 1 July 1965 (RADC&#x27;s &quot;Data Reduction Center&quot; processed 440L data transmitted to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

RADC developed a 1960s machine translation for Russian language documents and in the late 1960s, RADC coordinated the Ling-Temco-Vought AN/TRN-26 deployable TACAN development for the Vietnam War (1st units went to Israel and Camp David&#x27;s &quot;DVD&quot; site.) In the 1970s War On Drugs, RADC COMPASS TRIP research investigated &quot;multispectral reconnaissance techniques to locate opium poppy fields&quot;. By December 1977 RADC had developed the 322 watt &quot;solid state transmitter and receiver module&quot; while &quot;responsible for design, fabrication installation, integration test, and evaluation&quot; (through 1980).

====ESD assignment====

On 1 September 1975, RADC was reassigned to AFSC&#x27;s Electronic Systems Division (ESD). At Hanscom AFB on 1 January 1976, RADC&#x27;s Detachment 1 was activated for &quot;Electronic Technology&quot; with the personnel and equipment of the 1960 AFCRL&#x27;s Microwave Physics and Solid State Sciences divisions (&quot;RADC East&quot; colloq.)

In the 1980s and 1990s RADC funded a significant amount of research on software engineering, e.g., the Knowledge Based Software Assistant (KBSA) program.

===Rome Laboratory===
In 1990 RADC was redesignated Rome Laboratory which in October 1997 became part of the Air Force Research Laboratory.

<doc id="957559" wikidata="Q776938" url="?curid=957559" title="Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) is the professional head of the Royal Air Force and a member of both the Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Air Force Board. The post was created in 1918 with Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard as the first incumbent. The current and 30th Chief of the Air Staff is Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, who succeeded Sir Michael Wigston on 2 June 2023.

== Responsibilities ==
As the RAF progressively adopts responsibility for Air Capability planning and management from MOD Head Office, CAS will be responsible for commissioning RAF equipment, materiel and other support requirements. As a Service Chief of Staff, he has the right of direct access to the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister. CAS chairs the Air Force Board Standing Committee, and is a member of the Defence Council, the Air Force Board, the Armed Forces Committee, the Chiefs&#x27; of Staff Committee and the Senior Appointments Committee. Current responsibilities for CAS include:

* Managing the AIR Top-Level Budget to deliver the RAF&#x27;s Command Plan, in accordance with defence priorities and standing military tasks within the delegated funding;
* Ensuring the long-term health of the service, focusing on professional standards, ethos, welfare, career management and morale;
* Ensuring that the whole force, including civil servants and contractors, plays its part in delivering the required operational effects as components of a single team
* Advising on the development and maintenance of the optimum coherent set of requirements that UK defence requires;
* Providing CDS, MOD and the government with advice and recommendations on the operational employment of the RAF and contributing military experience and knowledge to assist in the development of defence policy.

==History==
The post of Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) was established in January 1918, just prior to the official formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF), and its first occupant was Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard. Following Trenchard&#x27;s resignation in March 1918 after disagreements with the first air minister, Lord Rothermere, his rival Major General Sir Frederick Sykes was appointed. For political reasons Trenchard&#x27;s resignation did not take effect until late April in order that he would be CAS when the RAF was formed. With Winston Churchill&#x27;s post-war appointment as Secretary of State for War and Air, Sykes was moved sideways to head up the nascent Civil Aviation ministry and Trenchard returned as CAS. In the early 1920s, Trenchard had to fight to keep the RAF from being divided and absorbed back into the Royal Navy and the British Army. After Lord Trenchard retired in 1930 there were still suggestions that the RAF should be broken up, but Trenchard&#x27;s foundations proved solid.

By the time the Second World War broke out in 1939, the then occupant of the post, Air Chief Marshal Sir Cyril Newall, had a service that had been undergoing the most rapid of expansions during the British rearmament programs of the late 1930s. Newall gave way in 1940 to Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, who led the service for the rest of the war. Portal was a tireless defender of the RAF and highly capable in administration and strategy. Postwar the RAF was reoriented to perform the dual roles of defending the shrinking British Empire and possibly fighting against the Soviet Union in a Warsaw Pact verses NATO war over Germany and the United Kingdom. The Chiefs of the Air Staff of the day had to fight a constant battle to keep the British aircraft industry alive. In the end only minimal success was achieved, with only a rump aviation industrial base left by the 1970s.

The first eight Chiefs of the Air Staff were originally commissioned in the British Army, with four coming from the infantry, two from the artillery and one each from the cavalry and the engineers. Of these both Lord Trenchard and Sir John Salmond each held the post over two separate periods. By the early mid-1950s sufficient time had elapsed for officers originally commissioned in the British air services of the First World War to have risen through the ranks to RAF&#x27;s senior post; Sir John Slessor had originally served in the Royal Flying Corps while Sir William Dickson was commissioned into the Royal Naval Air Service. In 1956 Sir Dermot Boyle became the first CAS to have originally been commissioned in the RAF.

Until 2023, every occupant of the post originally commissioned in the RAF was a qualified pilot. The first non-pilot to be appointed to the role is Sir Richard Knighton, who joined the RAF as an engineer, and who took up post in June 2023.

==Appointees==
The following list gives details of the chiefs of the air staff from 1918 to the present:

<text>Río Grande (&quot;English: Big River&quot;) is a city in Argentina, on the north coast of the eastern part of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. It has a population of 98,017, and is the industrial capital of the Tierra del Fuego Province. It is located north-east of Ushuaia, the capital of the province.

It is served by Hermes Quijada International Airport.

==History==

Sheep farming, as many other places in Patagonia, was the main impetus for population settlements beginning in the late 19th century.

Abundant rivers, the seacoast, and good pastures were some of the reasons that fueled population growth. Río Grande was founded on 11 July 1921, when the central government issued a decree recognising this locality as the &quot;Agricultural Colony of Río Grande&quot;.

In the beginning, the land was subdivided among a few families, owning large estates until the agrarian reform of 1925. Cattle raising became one of the most important economic activities in the area.

In 2014, the city came into international scrutiny after a mob of some 300 vehicles blocked the escape of the support staff for the BBC Television program &quot;Top Gear&quot; after they had already been attacked with eggs and stones in Tolhuin, on a protest that started after their car plate resembled the Falkland Islands dispute. Arriving at the river border crossing, the crew had to illegally cross the border with Chile, after the crew was temporarily expelled from the province, which their crossing was successful.

== Economy ==

To promote industrial development, Tierra del Fuego is excluded from VAT and federal income tax. As a result, several manufacturing companies, particularly those involving electronic products, have opened factories in this city. 

The city&#x27;s population has grown rapidly since 1980. Many people have relocated from the northern parts of Argentina and from other countries, such as Bolivia, to work in factories that offer higher wages than other provinces of Argentina and also as a result of the television set production and assembly plants opened by ITT.

One of the most rapidly growing sectors is the production of laptops and netbooks. These products were totally imported until 2006 but by 2010, and due to initiatives under the Kirchner administrations, 42% of the Argentine market for these goods was supplied by firms established in Río Grande and Vicente López. 

In April 2011, portfolio investments announced that they were planning to produce over 6.9 million units made in Tierra del Fuego Province, principally in Río Grande, which means more than a half of the sold netbooks in the country.

==Climate==

Rio Grande&#x27;s climate is strongly influenced by the ocean: generally quite cool, and sometimes very windy. It has a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;) bordering on a subantarctic climate very rare for the Southern Hemisphere, with cool temperatures year round. 
It also closely borders on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) and a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). Temperatures in the warmest months, January and February average while temperatures in the coolest month average . With a mean temperature of in the coldest month, Río Grande has the coldest mean monthly temperature among cities in Argentina. Precipitation is low at around . Also, due to its latitude, the length of the day varies tremendously across the year. Winter days can have as few as seven hours of sunlight, while summer days stretch to seventeen hours.
Frost occurs throughout the year, and winter temperatures can remain below freezing for relatively long periods of time. As such, the frost free period is very short with the first date of frost being 23 February and the last date of frost being 22 November. During the summer, conditions are generally very windy and cloudy, and nights remain cold. Freak snowfalls can occur even in midsummer. The highest recorded temperature was on 4 February 2019. It is believed that this is the southernmost recorded instance where temperatures exceed . The lowest recorded temperature was on 19 July 1984.

<text>Everything but the Girl are an English musical duo formed in Kingston upon Hull in 1982, consisting of lead singer, songwriter, composer and occasional guitarist Tracey Thorn and guitarist, keyboardist, songwriter, composer, producer and singer Ben Watt. The group&#x27;s early works have been categorized as sophisti-pop with jazz influences before undergoing an electronic music turn following the worldwide success of the 1994 hit single &quot;Missing&quot;, remixed by Todd Terry.

The duo have achieved four top 10 and 12 top 40 singles in the UK and received eight gold and two platinum album BPI certifications in the UK as well as one gold album RIAA certification in the US. Their cover of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot; reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart in 1988, a feat later matched by &quot;Missing&quot;, which charted high in several countries and reached No. 2 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1995 and spent over seven months on the UK Singles Chart for the &quot;Missing&quot; remix, which led to a Brit Award nomination for Best British Single.

Their ninth album, &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; (1996), entered the UK albums chart at No. 4, and spawned the top-10 singles &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; and &quot;Wrong.” The band went inactive in 2000, with Thorn declaring she would no longer perform live. Thorn and Watt, who did not publicise their romantic relationship while active, married in 2009, both released solo albums and said it was unlikely Everything but the Girl would be active again.

However, in November 2022, Thorn and Watt announced an album had been recorded for release in the second quarter of 2023. &quot;Fuse&quot;, the band&#x27;s first new material in 24 years, was released on 21 April 2023. It charted at No. 3 on the Official UK Album Chart, making it the highest charting album of their career. In a 5-star review, &quot;The Guardian&quot; said: &quot;Still staking out pop&#x27;s frontier after 40 years. It is audibly made by people with a deep love for and understanding of the music they&#x27;re inspired by … a comeback worth waiting for.&quot;

==History==
===Formation and early years===
When Thorn and Watt met, they were both attending the University of Hull and both had contracted with the independent record company Cherry Red Records as solo artists. Thorn was also a member of the trio Marine Girls. 

They formed a side-project as a duo and adopted the name Everything but the Girl from a slogan used by the Hull shop, &quot;Turner&#x27;s Furniture&quot; at 34-38 Beverley Road, between Norfolk Street and College Street.

Everything but the Girl&#x27;s debut EP, with a &quot;samba interpretation&quot; of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot;, was released in June 1982. After steady sales and exposure on the &quot;Cherry Red&quot; record label&#x27;s 99-pence promotional Christmas 1982 compilation album entitled &quot;Pillows &amp; Prayers&quot;, the single was reissued in August 1983.

Later, the pair, separately, each, had solo album releases through Cherry Red. Thorn&#x27;s 1982 LP was &quot;A Distant Shore&quot;, an eight-track mini-album. Watt&#x27;s 1983 debut LP, &quot;North Marine Drive&quot;, was the follow-up to his 1982 5-track EP &quot;Summer Into Winter&quot;, featuring Robert Wyatt.

On 5 January 1983, Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt, as &quot;Everything But the Girl&quot;, made their live debut at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and performed with Paul Weller.

Thorn and Watt, as &quot;Everything but the Girl&quot; signed to Blanco y Negro Records.

Recorded in September 1983, in May 1984, their debut album, &quot;Eden,&quot; was released, reaching No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart, spending 20 weeks on the chart. It featured the single &quot;Each and Every One&quot;, which reached No. 28 on the UK top 40. Thorn wrote in 2016 that her lyric was misunderstood as a lovelorn lament, when it was actually a response to the patronizing tone her earlier all-female band Marine Girls was written about by male music critics.

In spite of their early history as established independent artists, as newcomers Everything but the Girl were considered part of the &quot;lite-jazz/neo-jazz-pop&quot; music style, later known as &quot;sophisti-pop&quot;, alongside other British acts such as Carmel, a then-newly-solo Alison Moyet, Swing Out Sister, Sade, Matt Bianco and The Style Council. Both Watt and Thorn were guest musicians on the Style Council&#x27;s &quot;Café Bleu&quot; album, where Thorn&#x27;s vocals were featured on &quot;The Paris Match&quot;. Everything but the Girl worked with producer Robin Millar, who also produced Sade&#x27;s debut album in the same studio, alternating between recording and collaborating with the two bands.

A later version of the album, &quot;Everything but the Girl&quot;, was released in the United States on the Sire label, containing six tracks from &quot;Eden&quot;, two UK singles and four alternate tracks, the six substitutions replace the second side.

&quot;Love Not Money&quot;, released in 1985, was the band&#x27;s second studio album release, signaling a move away from jazz and Latin influences to more traditional electric guitar, bass and drums arrangements. The US edition included two songs not on the original UK release: a cover version of the Pretenders&#x27; song &quot;Kid&quot; and &quot;Heaven Help Me&quot;.

In 1986, the band released &quot;Baby, the Stars Shine Bright&quot;, recorded with an orchestra at Abbey Road Studios. They revealed the album&#x27;s inspiration by their choices of B-sides for the single releases: songs from Bacharach and Jimmy Webb on the 12&quot; versions (as well as a cover version of Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot;). The first single from the album was &quot;Come on Home&quot;, followed by &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Behind&quot;.

In 1988, Everything but the Girl released &quot;Idlewild&quot;. Blending acoustic instrumentation with sequenced drums and synthesisers, it reached No. 13 on the UK Albums Chart, spending 15 weeks on the chart. A cover version of Danny Whitten&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot;, previously a success for Rod Stewart, was released as a single shortly afterwards. It reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart and was added to the latter issues of the album. Around this time, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions asked Thorn to contribute vocals to the song &quot;Big Snake&quot; on their final studio album, &quot;Mainstream&quot;.

1990&#x27;s Los-Angeles-recorded &quot;slick, commercial&quot; album &quot;The Language of Life&quot; was produced by Tommy LiPuma and featured notable US west coast and US east coast session musicians, including Omar Hakim, Vinnie Colaiuta, Lenny Castro, Joe Sample and Michael Brecker. Stan Getz contributed a tenor sax solo on the song &quot;The Road&quot;. The single &quot;Driving&quot;. received heavy rotation on American adult alternative radio.

In 1991, they released the self-produced album &quot;Worldwide&quot;. It charted at No. 29 on the UK Albums Chart.

1992 saw the release of the acoustic &quot;Covers&quot; EP. It reached No. 13 on the UK top 40. The lead track was &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;. It also included cover versions of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Tougher Than the Rest&quot;; Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Time after Time&quot; and Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Alison&quot;. These four tracks were included on the US only album, &quot;Acoustic&quot;.

In the summer of 1992, the duo was forced to curtail recording and touring for several months when Watt became seriously ill. He was eventually diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, a rare autoimmune disease. Watt was hospitalised for 10 weeks, and endured several life-saving operations; he subsequently wrote a memoir, &quot;Patient&quot;, about his near-death ordeal.

In 1993, Everything but the Girl released two EPs in the UK. One featured a cover version of Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot;. The other spawned a subsequent top 10 UK hit, &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know I Was Looking for Love&quot;, for Karen Ramirez.

===Worldwide acclaim===
In 1994, Everything but the Girl released their seventh album, &quot;Amplified Heart&quot;, a hybrid of folk rock and electronica featuring contributions from guitarist Richard Thompson, double bassist Danny Thompson, drummer Dave Mattacks, and producer/programmer John Coxon. Producer Todd Terry remixed the track &quot;Missing&quot;, and when released as a single, it became an international success. It reached the top ten around the world, including the US, where it peaked at No. 2 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

While recording &quot;Amplified Heart&quot; Thorn and Watt wrote lyrics and music for two tracks – &quot;Protection&quot; and &quot;Better Things&quot; on Massive Attack&#x27;s second album &quot;Protection&quot;. Thorn sang lead vocals on both. The single &quot;Protection&quot; reached No. 14 on the UK top 40. The album reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart.

Buoyed by the recent successes and out of contract at WEA, Everything but the Girl released the self-produced &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; in 1996 exclusively licensed to Atlantic Records for the United States and Canada and Virgin Records for the Rest of the World. Featuring collaborations with Spring Heel Jack and Howie B it ushered in a new electronic sound for their own work. It charted at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned two top ten UK singles – &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; and &quot;Wrong&quot;. Two further singles – &quot;Single&quot; and &quot;Before Today&quot; – reached No. 20 and No. 25 respectively.

In 1999, the duo followed it up with their ninth studio album, &quot;Temperamental&quot;. It charted at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart.

The duo performed their final show at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2000.

===Extended hiatus===

Between 2000 and 2022, there were no new recordings from Everything but the Girl. In 2002, 2004, and 2005, the duo curated compilations of their material. The 2004 compilation, &quot;Like the Deserts Miss the Rain&quot;, was a DVD release that included footage of a 1999 performance at the Forum venue in London, UK, for which John McKenzie and long-time collaborator Martin Ditcham performed alongside the pair as session musicians.

From 1999, Watt concentrated on DJ and production/remix work, finding success as one half of Lazy Dog, with partner Jay Hannan, and collaborating with Beth Orton on her 1999 album &quot;Central Reservation&quot; and her 2002 album &quot;Daybreaker&quot;. Watt then proceeded with a new angle on his solo career that included launching the Buzzin&#x27; Fly record label in 2003, and becoming the part-owner-founder of the Neighbourhood and Cherry Jam nightclubs from 2002–2005. Watt released a string of club-oriented productions including the &quot;Bright Star&quot; EP, with producer Stimming and British singer Julia Biel, on Buzzin&#x27; Fly in 2010.

In 2005, Thorn co-wrote and recorded vocals for the song &quot;Damage&quot;, a collaboration with German band Tiefschwarz that appeared on their &quot;Eat Books&quot; album. Thorn&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Out of the Woods&quot;, was then released in 2007, followed by her third solo album, &quot;Love and Its Opposite&quot;, in 2010. In October 2011, Thorn released a cover version of The xx&#x27;s &quot;Night Time&quot;, on which Watt played guitar and sang backing vocals. This was their first recording together in over a decade, although it was not an Everything but the Girl release.

In an April 2011 interview, Thorn was asked whether she would ever work again with Watt as Everything but the Girl. Thorn responded, &quot;Yes, we do keep saying we are nearly ready to maybe do some work together again. There are certain obstacles, some practical, some psychological, that we would need to overcome. But it may well happen.&quot; A collection of Christmas songs, &quot;Tinsel and Lights&quot;, for which Thorn recorded cover versions of Christmas songs with two new original songs, was released in October 2012 on Buzzin&#x27; Fly&#x27;s sister record label Strange Feeling. Watt and the couple&#x27;s children provided backing vocals on the original song &quot;Joy&quot;.

In 2012, the band&#x27;s first four albums were reissued by Edsel Records as &quot;deluxe&quot; double CDs, with demo recordings and other additional material. At the time, Watt explained that Warner Music Group still maintained control over their back catalogue: &quot;our big fear was that one day we&#x27;d wake up and they&#x27;d have reissued them, without telling us.&quot;; when the representative from Edsel, a company that specialises in reissued material, made contact, the couple decided that the time was appropriate. Additionally, Thorn stated that the thought of reforming the band and playing live filled her &quot;with cold dread&quot;—upon re-listening to the early Everything but the Girl records, Thorn experienced a sense of &quot;Gosh, well, I&#x27;m not really that person any more.&quot;

A second tranche of Demon/Edsel reissues, covering the four albums released between 1990 and 1994, was announced in September 2013. According to the Everything but the Girl website, &quot;Once again, Ben and Tracey have helped at every stage of the process, sourcing demos, rarities and memorabilia for the releases.&quot;

The band&#x27;s final two albums, &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; and &quot;Temperamental&quot; were given the deluxe treatment and were reissued by Demon/Edsel on 4 September 2015.

Watt paused his association with record labels and DJ activities to return to his folk-jazz singer-songwriter roots in 2014. His first solo album since 1983, &quot;Hendra&quot; was released on 14 April 2014. It featured collaborations with Bernard Butler, formerly of the band Suede, Berlin-based producer Ewan Pearson and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. The album won the &#x27;Best &#x27;Difficult&#x27; Second Album&#x27; category at the AIM Independent Music Awards 2014. It was included at No 27 in &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Top 75 Albums of 2014. He followed it up in 2016 with &quot;Fever Dream&quot;. It continued his relationship with Bernard Butler, and added guest cameos from MC Taylor of North Carolina folk-rock band, Hiss Golden Messenger, and Boston singer-songwriter Marissa Nadler. It received a 9/10 review in &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine. In a four-star review, &quot;The Guardian&quot; said: &#x27;In his early 50s, he is making some of the best music of his career.&#x27;

In addition to solo music projects, both Thorn and Watt have written books. Thorn&#x27;s 2013 memoir, &quot;Bedsit Disco Queen&quot;, covers a significant portion of the history of Everything but the Girl as a band.

In July 2017, Everything but the Girl reclaimed the rights to eight of their albums, plus the American rights to &quot;Temperamental&quot; and &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; from Warner Music Group; this catalogue will now be distributed through Chrysalis Records under licence from Watt&#x27;s Strange Feeling label.

===Comeback and &quot;Fuse&quot;===
On 2 November 2022, Thorn announced on Twitter that a new Everything but the Girl album had been recorded and would be released in spring 2023.

The first single from their 11th album &quot;Fuse&quot;, &quot;Nothing Left to Lose&quot; premiered on BBC Radio 6 Music on 10 January 2023. &quot;Fuse&quot; was released on 21 April 2023 and features &quot;Nothing Left to Lose&quot; along with nine more original songs, both electronic and acoustic. 

On 9 August, they released &quot;Live at Maida Vale&quot;, a four-track EP featuring live in-studio performances of three &quot;Fuse&quot; songs and 1996&#x27;s &quot;Single&quot;.

The band has no plans to play live.

<text>John Frederick Wolfenden, Baron Wolfenden, (26 June 1906 – 18 January 1985) was a British educationalist probably best remembered for chairing the Wolfenden Committee whose report, recommending the decriminalisation of homosexuality, was published in 1957. He was headmaster of Uppingham and Shrewsbury public schools.

== Early life ==
Wolfenden was born on 26 June 1906 in Swindon, Wiltshire, England. He was the son of George Wolfenden and Emily Hannah Gaukroger, both born in Halifax, Yorkshire. George Wolfenden became an official of the West Riding Local Education Authority based in Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, where John attended Queen Elizabeth Grammar School. He won a scholarship to Oxford.

== Professional life ==
Having studied in Oxford, Wolfenden became a don at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1929.

John Wolfenden was the headmaster of Uppingham School (1934–1944) and Shrewsbury School (1944–1950) and chairman of various government committees which mostly focused on education and problems with youth.

In 1950 he became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Reading and found time to write two books, &quot;Family Affair&quot; and &quot;The Steele Age&quot;, both part of the series of &#x27;Take Home Books&#x27;.

From 1954 to 1957 he was Chairman of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution, known in shorthand as the Wolfenden Committee after himself, whose report was published in 1957. Wolfenden had been appointed to head the committee by the then Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe to consider whether the existing laws on these should be changed. Maxwell Fyfe would later come to oppose the liberalisation of gay rights while sitting as Lord Kilmuir in the House of Lords. Geraldine Bedell noted the irony of this, and commented: &quot;Perhaps he [Maxwell-Fyfe] thought, by handing over to a committee, to shelve the issue. Perhaps he assumed Wolfenden would find against, in which case, he chose a curious chairman, because Wolfenden had a gay son, Jeremy.&quot;

In 1957, Wolfenden chaired an independent committee initiated by the Central Council of Physical Recreation which investigated the role of various statutory and voluntary groups in sport in the United Kingdom. The committee published its report in 1960, and fifty years later it was still an influential work in its field.

In 1962, the Privy Council appointed Wolfenden as Chairman of the Council for the Training of Health Workers and the Council for the Training in Social Work, two bodies established by the Health Visiting and Social Work (Training) Act 1962.

Wolfenden was director of the British Museum from 1969 to 1973, became President of Chelsea College in 1972, Chairman of the Chelsea Building Society and Metropolitan Association of Building Societies in 1978.

==Personal life==
Wolfenden married Eileen Spilsbury in 1932, they had two sons and two daughters. His elder son was Jeremy Wolfenden, a foreign correspondent for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and a British spy.

He died aged 78, on 18 January 1985 in Guildford, Surrey, England.

== Thoughts and ideas ==
In his essay &quot;The Gap—The Bridge&quot;, Wolfenden discusses the problems with institutional dichotomy.

His memoirs were published by The Bodley Head in 1976, under the title of &quot;Turning Points&quot;.

== Titles ==
Wolfenden was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1942, and was knighted in 1956.

He was created a life peer on 12 July 1974 with the title Baron Wolfenden, &quot;of Westcott in the County of Surrey&quot;.

<doc id="957588" wikidata="Q1395400" url="?curid=957588" title="Family First Party">
<text>The Family First Party was a conservative political party in Australia which existed from 2002 to 2017. It was founded in South Australia where it enjoyed its greatest electoral support. Since the demise of the Australian Conservatives into which it merged, it has been refounded in that state as the Family First Party (2021), where it contested the state election in 2022, but failed to win a seat.

Family First had three candidates elected to the Senate during its existence—Steve Fielding (2005–2011), Bob Day (2014–2016), and Lucy Gichuhi (2017; elected on a countback following Day being declared ineligible). At state level, the party won a seat in the South Australian Legislative Council across four consecutive state elections (2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014). It also briefly had representatives in the New South Wales Legislative Council and Western Australian Legislative Council, as a result of defections from other parties.

The party was generally considered to be part of the Christian right. Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the Pentecostal church in South Australia, and nationally from smaller Christian denominations. Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-Liberals via Robert Brokenshire and Day. Originally advocating a moral and family values agenda, Day, who would become Family First&#x27;s major donor, later reoriented Family First to begin to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and smaller government, which brought Family First closer to Cory Bernardi&#x27;s Australian Conservatives. Family First and its two state parliamentarians Dennis Hood and Brokenshire joined and merged with Bernardi&#x27;s Australian Conservatives on 25 April 2017.

Newly appointed Family First senator Lucy Gichuhi did not join the Conservatives, and became an independent senator when Family First was disbanded. Gichuhi was invited to join the Australian Conservatives&#x27; voting bloc in the Senate, but ultimately chose to join the Liberal Party. Brokenshire was not re-elected at the 2018 state election, and Hood left the Conservatives to join the Liberal Party on 26 March 2018.

==History==
The party was founded 2002 in South Australia, in time to contest the 2002 state election, when former Assemblies of God pastor Andrew Evans became its first elected member, winning a seat in the South Australian Legislative Council. A second party member, pharmaceutical executive Dennis Hood, was elected to the Legislative Council at the 2006 state election. Robert Brokenshire replaced Evans following the latter&#x27;s retirement in 2008.

At the 2004 federal election, Family First contested seats all over Australia, generally exchanging preferences with Liberal candidates, although in some seats it exchanged preferences with the Australian Labor Party. In Queensland, the party refused to direct preferences to Liberal candidate Ingrid Tall on the grounds she was openly gay, also refusing to preference Liberal candidate Warren Entsch for his support for same-sex marriage. At that election, Steve Fielding was elected as a senator for Victoria for the party. Fielding, along with independent Nick Xenophon and the five Australian Greens, shared the balance of power in the Senate from July 2008 to July 2011. He lost his seat at the 2010 federal election.

In June 2008, sitting MP and former Liberal Party member, Dan Sullivan, joined the Western Australian state branch of Family First as an executive member. When three former One Nation MPs attended the public launch of the branch, it fuelled media speculation that they might try to influence the West Australian branch.

During the 2009/10 financial year, party chairman Bob Day made two loans totalling $405,000 to Family First. After gaining 4% of the vote in several House of Representatives seats in the 2010 federal election, the party also received around $400,000 in Commonwealth election funding.

Family First returned to the Australian Senate at the 2013 federal election, when Day was elected as a senator for South Australia. He was re-elected at the 2016 double dissolution federal election. A few months later, his family-owned building company, Home Australia Group, ran into financial difficulties and was wound up. Day announced immediately that he would resign from the senate as a consequence, however he did not resign immediately, allowing time for the party to develop a process for selecting a replacement. He resigned on 1 November 2016 creating a vacancy in the senate. In April 2017 the high court ruled that he was invalidly elected in July 2016 and had been ineligible to sit in the senate since February 2016. The vacancy created by Day&#x27;s resignation was filled by another Family First senate candidate, Lucy Gichuhi. Gichuhi was declared by the court of disputed returns on 13 April 2017 to be elected instead of Day, after a special recount of South Australian senate votes.

===Merger with the Australian Conservatives===
On 26 April 2017, a merger between the Australian Conservatives and the Family First Party was announced, with Family First to be absorbed into the Conservatives. Newly appointed Family First senator Lucy Gichuhi did not join the Conservatives, and became an independent senator when the Family First Party was disbanded. The party formally relinquished its registration with the Australian Electoral Commission on 30 August 2017.

Psephologist Antony Green suggested the merger could in part be attributed to the abolition of group voting tickets, which makes it more difficult for like-minded parties to swap preferences without a certain amount of &quot;leakage&quot; to other parties.

According to John Macaulay, an executive of the Australian Conservatives Board, and the dissolution document of Family First, the Party did not merge with the Australian Conservatives. The Family First executive voted to dissolve the party, and in accordance with Australian law, they donated all their assets to the Australian Conservative Party.

== Religious affiliation ==
Although officially eschewing religious labels, many of its candidates and members were from conservative Christian backgrounds. Family First co-founder Pastor Andrew Evans was the General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God in Australia for twenty years. In the 2002 South Australian election and the 2004 federal election, a number of Family First candidates were church members. In New South Wales, 11 of their 23 candidates for the 2004 federal election were from an Assemblies of God church, the Hawkesbury Church in Windsor.

South Australian Family First Member of the Legislative Council Dennis Hood, the party&#x27;s state parliamentary leader, is a member of the Rostrevor Baptist Church. When &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; columnist Peter Goers stated that Hood was an anti-evolution Creationist, Hood did not deny this in his response, while he did attempt to set the record straight on issues of policy.

Family First&#x27;s preferencing agreement with the Coalition in the 2004 federal election led Barnaby Joyce, the National senate candidate for Queensland, to publicly slam the party the day before the election, calling them &quot;the lunatic Right&quot;, and stating that &quot;these are not the sort of people you do preference deals with&quot;. Joyce&#x27;s comments came in response to a pamphlet published by one of the party&#x27;s Victorian Senate candidates, Danny Nalliah who in his capacity as a church pastor had criticised other religions and homosexuality.

In September 2004, party leader Andrea Mason said that Family First is not a Christian party and Family First Federal Secretary Dr Matt Burnet issued a press release stating:

The party is not a church party or an Assembly of God party, nor is it funded by AOG churches. It does see itself as socially conservative, with Family Values based on Christian ethics. Like any mainstream party we do not have on record the religious affiliations of any of our members. The Board of Reference in South Australia includes business-people, members of the medical profession, as well as ministers and people from Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Uniting and other church groups. The rapid national growth of the party leading into this election and the late decision to contest in all seats possible, has meant that in some states there are candidates, with strong family values, who have been introduced to the party through the personal relationships they have from their involvement in community/church networks.

A 60-minute documentary was made for the ABC-TV Compass program in 2005 and called &quot;Family First – A Federal Crusade&quot;. It was produced by Dr Bruce Redman from The University of Queensland.

By August 2010, the party maintained its non-denominational stance and affirmed its affinity towards Christianity in stating &quot;Family First in 2010 is independent of any church or denomination...like so many other Australian institutions, at Family First our Christian
heritage is something we are both proud of and grateful for.&quot;

==Elections and results==
===Federal elections===

====2004 federal election ====
The party agreed to share House of Representatives preferences with the Liberal–National Coalition at the 2004 election (with some exceptions discussed below).

Family First picked up 1.76% of the vote nationally. Steve Fielding, the lead candidate in Victoria, was successful in picking up the last Senate seat. Although he received a primary vote of only 1.88% (56,376 votes), he achieved the 14.3% quota required by a run of preferences including those from the Australian Labor Party. The typically apolitical psephologist Malcolm Mackerras stated &quot;The outlandish result occurred in Victoria in 2004 where the Family First party was able to gather tickets from just about everywhere... this is a fluke. And I’ve always referred to Senator Steve Fielding as the Fluke Senator&quot;.

The party also came close to picking up other Senate seats in Tasmania (largely due to preferences from surplus Liberal votes) and in South Australia where the then party leader Andrea Mason narrowly missed out (polling 3.98% and receiving Liberal preferences).

====2007 federal election====
Family First contested the 2007 federal election, in particular seeking to increase its Senate representation. Nationwide, the party received 1.62% of the primary vote in the Senate, and 1.99% in the House of Representatives, both down slightly on the 2004 result. In Victoria, however, both the lower and upper house vote increased by 0.64%, to 2.52 and 3.02% respectively. No Family First candidates were elected. Sitting senator Steve Fielding&#x27;s term did not expire until 2011.

Before the 2007 federal election, Fred Nile criticized Family First for giving preferences (in some states) to the Liberty and Democracy Party, a libertarian political party one of whose policies was to legalize recreational drug use, stating &quot;They gave their preferences to the enemy, the anti-Christian party.&quot; This was suggested as a reason for their poor election result. Fred Nile&#x27;s own Christian Democratic Party had also preferenced the Liberty and Democracy Party before any other major party in the Senate.

In 2008, some newspapers claimed that Fielding wanted to &quot;relaunch himself as a mainstream political player, beyond Family First&#x27;s ultra-conservative evangelical Christian support base.&quot; The reports indicated that Fielding had tried to recruit Tim Costello and others around the beginning of 2008 with a view to forming a new party, but had failed to convince them. The revelations came after Fielding changed his position on abortion, after being rebuffed by his party for taking a softer approach. Fielding denied the claims.

====2010 federal election====
At the 2010 federal election, Family First contested the Senate in all states, but were not successful, with the national vote remaining at around 2%. Fielding&#x27;s term ended on 30 June 2011, after which the Family First Party no longer had federal parliamentary representation.

The Queensland Family First Senate candidate Wendy Francis created controversy when she compared allowing same-sex marriage to the stolen generations and to &quot;legalising child abuse&quot;.

====2013 federal election====

Bob Day ran as a Family First Party South Australia Senate candidate at the 2013 federal election and was successful. The South Australian Senate Family First vote was 3.8% (down 0.3%), getting to the 14.3% quota through Glenn Druery&#x27;s Minor Party Alliance from 19 group voting ticket party preferences: Australian Independents Party, Australian Stable Population Party, Liberal Democratic Party, Smokers&#x27; Rights Party, No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics, Building Australia Party, Rise Up Australia Party, Katter&#x27;s Australian Party, One Nation, Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party, Australian Christians, Shooters and Fishers, Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, Democratic Labour Party, Animal Justice Party, Australian Greens, Palmer United Party, HEMP Party, Australian Labor Party. The nationwide Family First Senate vote was 1.1% (down 1.0%). Day assumed his seat on 1 July 2014.

====2016 federal election====

As Family First&#x27;s sole incumbent, Bob Day was unexpectedly successful at the 2016 federal election, despite having unsuccessfully mounted a High Court challenge against newly implemented Senate voting reforms which included the removal of group voting tickets, a feature which was crucial to the election of Day at the previous election. Though the South Australian Senate Family First vote was reduced to just 2.9% (down 0.9%), as the election was a double dissolution, the quota to be elected was halved. Day got to the 7.7% quota largely from Liberal preferences when the Liberal&#x27;s 5th candidate Sean Edwards was eliminated from the count, largely due to the fact the Liberal how-to-vote card recommended Liberal voters to preference Family First. Electing only six Senators per state at a non-double dissolution election, the 12th and last spot in South Australia at this election came down to a race between Day and Labor&#x27;s 4th candidate Anne McEwen. McEwen solidly led Day for the overwhelming majority of the count, until count 445 of a total 457. However, upon Edwards and then One Nation candidate Steven Burgess being eliminated at count 445 and 455 respectively, leaving only McEwen and Day remaining, Day had collected enough preferences to overtake and narrowly defeat McEwen − by just a couple of thousand preference votes. The nationwide Family First Senate vote was 1.4% (up 0.3%). Elected to the 12th and final South Australian Senate spot, he was entitled to a three-year term. Due to the failure of his home construction business, Day resigned from the Senate on 1 November 2016 and a replacement was expected to be selected in the following two to three weeks. In April 2017, the High Court found that he had been invalidly elected to the Senate at the 2016 election because the leasing arrangements for his electoral office had breached section 44 of the Constitution making him ineligible for the Senate, leading to a special recount of South Australian senate ballots to find a replacement.

On 13 April 2017 Lucy Gichuhi was declared the new South Australian senator in place of Day, following a recount of ballots. Her appointment was challenged by the Australian Labor Party but the High Court rejected the challenge as to whether she has renounced her Kenyan citizenship or retained a dual Kenyan and Australian citizenship.

====Federal by-elections since 2004====
Following the resignation of Mark Latham and their acquisition of a Senate seat in 2004, Family First contested the 2005 Werriwa by-election and in the absence of a Liberal candidate received 2,890 first preference votes. They had not contested Werriwa in 2004.

As a result of their relatively poor form in the 2007 election, Family First did not contest the 2008 Gippsland by-election, but in a later by-election for the seat of Mayo they won 11.40% of the vote but only ran fourth in the absence of a Labor candidate, a total that was only 4% above their vote in the 2007 general election.

Family First did not stand a candidate in any of the 2008 Lyne, 2009 Bradfield or 2009 Higgins by-elections.

===State elections===

====2002 South Australian election====
The first election Family First contested was the 2002 South Australian state election. Dr Andrew Evans received a primary vote of 4.02% which, along with preferences from other parties, was sufficient to obtain the 8.3% quota and get elected to one of the 11 seats in the South Australian Legislative Council.

====State elections from 2004 until 2017====
In the 2005 Western Australian election, Family First polled 21,701 votes in the Legislative Council where it contested 34 candidates compared to 57 candidates in major parties.

In the 2006 South Australian election, Family First&#x27;s vote increased to 4.98% in the Legislative Council, and a second Member of the Legislative Council was elected – former pharmaceutical executive Dennis Hood. In several rural and outer metropolitan seats, Family First&#x27;s vote approached 10% – and in the seat of Kavel, Tom Playford, a descendant of former premier Tom Playford, achieved a vote of 15.7%. In the Legislative Council, Family First shares the balance of power with the other minor parties and independents.

In the 2006 Queensland state election, Family First received a primary vote of 7% in contested seats (many seats were not contested), with a high of 14.5% and several other seats posting results of 10%. Queensland does not have an upper house, and these results were insufficient for any candidates to be elected.

In the 2006 Victorian state election, Family First&#x27;s vote increased from 1.9% to 4.3% of first preferences. However, no candidates were elected.

In the 2012 Queensland state election the party unsuccessfully contested 38 seats.

In the 2017 Western Australian state election, Family First fielded 2 candidates in each of the six Legislative Council regions, and three candidates for Legislative Assembly seats. Voting for the Legislative Council uses group voting tickets. At the 2017 election, Family First participated with four other parties in a set of preference deals orchestrated by Glenn Druery. The other parties were Fluoride Free WA, Liberal Democrats, Flux the System and the Daylight Saving Party. The deals were arranged so that the ticket votes for these five parties would roll up to a different party in each region. The system collected votes so that Family First&#x27;s best chance was in the North Metropolitan region. However, the party did not gain any seats at the election.

==Defections from other parties==
The party has benefited from a series of high-profile defections.
*Former South Australian state Liberal minister Robert Brokenshire contested the 2007 federal election for the party, and subsequently won preselection to replace retiring founder Evans in the state Legislative Council. At the 2010 South Australian Election, Robert Brokenshire was re-elected as a Family First candidate for a Legislative Council seat.
*In June 2008, former Western Australian deputy Liberal leader Dan Sullivan announced that he would become the parliamentary leader of the state branch of the party. Three former One Nation MPs have expressed support for the new party. On 14 August 2008, independent (former Liberal) Western Australian MP Anthony Fels joined the Party. At the 2008 Western Australian state election both Sullivan and Fels stood for seats in the Western Australian Legislative Council, but neither was successful. Fels remained a member of the Legislative Council until his term expired in May 2009.
*Also in June 2008, Bob Randall, a former South Australian Liberal MP and party president joined the party, complaining that the Liberal Party had drifted too far to the &quot;left&quot;, and that &quot;Family First is the only truly conservative political force now left in Australia&quot;.
*On 3 August 2008 Bob Day, a prominent Coalition fundraiser and Liberal candidate for Makin in the 2007 federal election announced that he was joining Family First. He contested the 2008 Mayo by-election for the party, gaining 11.4 percent of the primary vote, but was not elected.
*In New South Wales, former Christian Democratic Party MLC Gordon Moyes became an independent in 2009 for a few months before joining Family First. He was defeated at the 2011 state election.
*In June 2013, former Katter&#x27;s Australian Party candidate and national director Aidan McLindon joined Family First and was the lead Senate candidate for Family First in Queensland in the 2013 federal election.

== Political ideology ==

=== Environment and climate change ===
* Opposition to any emissions trading scheme or &#x27;carbon tax&#x27; and government subsidies to renewable energy.
* Support for an independent enquiry which is prepared to hear scientists who disagree with climate change.

=== Education ===
* Support for independent (private) school funding.
* Allow principals and school councils to choose staff based on &#x27;values&#x27;.
* Allow schools to direct their own building improvement works, rather than relying on governments.

=== Bioethics and family policy ===
* Opposition to late term abortion in most cases.
* Opposition to voluntary euthanasia.
* Support for retention of the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others (i.e opposition to same-sex marriage). 
* Opposition to surrogacy in all forms (including altruistic surrogacy).
* Support for programs which encourage families to be &#x27;self-reliant&#x27; and reduce the need for government assistance.

=== Economy ===
* Support for a 20/20/20 tax system ($20,000 tax-free threshold, 20 percent flat income tax and 20 percent flat company tax).
* Opposition to payroll and mining taxes.
* Abolition of the Commonwealth Grants Commission.
* Support for lowering small business taxes.

=== Employment and workplace relations ===
* Belief in workplace deregulation and that legislation designed to protect workers rights is bad for the economy and morally wrong.
* Removal of workplace regulations and awards to combat the &quot;welfare reliance&quot; of Australians.
* Support for the freedom of those who choose to work differently by moving out of the regulated world of &#x27;traditional employment&#x27;.
* Family First was opposed to some aspects of the Howard government&#x27;s Australian Workplace Agreement measures. In his maiden speech, Senator Steve Fielding argued for a fairer work, rest and &#x27;family time&#x27; (or leisure balance) in opposing the measures.

=== Immigration ===
* Support for fast on-shore processing for asylum seekers and opposition to the Pacific Solution.

=== Indigenous affairs ===
* Opposition to the Native Title Act as it currently stands, as Native Title rights do not confer the right to sell, lease, develop or offer the land as security for economic development.
* Belief that &#x27;the only long-term solution is for Aboriginal Australians to move into the modern world and connect with the modern economy&#x27;.
* Repeal of any law which distinguishes between any Australian on the basis of race or colour.

=== Housing and property development ===
* Support removal of urban growth boundaries and zoning restrictions.
* Privatisation of planning approvals and removal of up-front infrastructure charges.
* Opposition to the &#x27;progressive erosion&#x27; of property owners&#x27; rights through legislation, heritage listing, water restrictions, native vegetation, rising sea levels, zoning and court decisions.

=== Poverty ===
* Support for education and training to take people out of poverty.
* Support for foreign aid.

=== Drugs ===
* Support for rehabilitation and recovery programs and for prison-based programs to address drug use.
* Opposition to injecting rooms as &#x27;expensive and ineffective&#x27;.

== Structure ==
Family First was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee and managed by an executive committee comprising the board of directors. Decision making was tightly held within the executive group, including the capacity to elect new members to the executive, determine party policy and ratify candidate pre-selection.

A National Conference occurred every two years, with delegates from state party licensees. Federal and State branches held Annual General Meetings that were open to all members.

==Political relations==
David Leyonhjelm of the Liberal Democratic Party and Day announced their intention to vote as a bloc in the Senate on economic issues, but separately on social issues.

Family First and the Australian Greens were often at odds, with Family First often referring to the Greens as &quot;extreme&quot; in their media statements. The two parties were in competition for Senate preferences, particularly from the Labor Party, and were ideologically opposed on many issues. In the 2006 Victorian election, Family First&#x27;s limited television advertising campaign specifically singled out the Greens for criticism.

<text>Maximilian Joseph Johannes Eduard Schuler (5 February 1882 in Zweibrücken – 30 July 1972) was a German engineer and is best known for discovering the principle known as Schuler tuning which is fundamental to the operation of a gyrocompass or inertial guidance system that will be operated near the surface of the Earth.

Schuler&#x27;s cousin Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe founded a firm near Kiel, Germany, to manufacture navigational devices using gyroscopes in 1905, and Schuler joined the firm in 1906. For many years they struggled with the problem of maintaining a vertical reference as a craft moved around on the surface of the Earth.

In 1923 Schuler published his discovery that if the gyrocompass was tuned to have an 84.4 minute period of oscillation (the &quot;Schuler period&quot;) then it would resist errors due to sideways acceleration of the ship or aircraft in which it was installed.

Later, Schuler served as a professor of dynamics at the University of Göttingen. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project he supervised one dissertation there, that of Kurt Magnus (whose other supervisor was Ludwig Prandtl).

<doc id="957596" wikidata="Q7498737" url="?curid=957596" title="Shirley Dinsdale">
<text>Shirley Dinsdale Layburn (October 31, 1926 – May 9, 1999), better known by her maiden name of Shirley Dinsdale, was an American ventriloquist and television and radio personality of the 1940s and early 1950s.

She is best remembered for her dummy &quot;Judy Splinters&quot; and for the early 15-minute children&#x27;s television show that bears that name. In 1949, she received the first Emmy award (first award in the first presentation) for Outstanding Television Personality when she was a student at UCLA. After her television career, she also achieved success in a second career as a cardiopulmonary therapist.

==Early life==
Dinsdale was born in San Francisco, California in 1926. After being badly burned in a household accident when she was 5 years old, she was given a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy by her father, who manufactured dummies for department stores, as part of her recovery. That dummy, which she named Judy Splinters, inspired her to make her break into radio. Lawrence Johnson, a ventriloquist, helped Dinsdale improve her natural talent for throwing her voice.

Dinsdale was an A student at Drew School in San Francisco. By the time she was 16, she had received a Distinguished Honor Citation from the United States government for her promotion of war bonds. During the war, she was student chairman for Southern California Schools at War.

==Career==

===Radio===
Dinsdale made her start in radio in 1941 with &quot;Judy in Wonderland&quot; on KGO in San Francisco. The program later moved to KPO in San Francisco.

In 1942, she and her family moved to Los Angeles and she was given a spot on Eddie Cantor&#x27;s program. She was called &quot;radio&#x27;s most refreshing discovery in years.&quot; A successful season on Nelson Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Electric Hour&quot; program on CBS in 1945 led to a tour lasting almost 11 months, during which she visited patients in military hospitals under the auspices of the United Service Organizations and participated in more than 500 USO shows during that span.

===Television===
During World War II, she was an active member of the Hollywood Victory Committee. After the war, she made her break into the budding television industry on KTLA (also in Los Angeles) doing show announcements, birthday greetings, and small spots. These spots, while not initially prominent, garnered her critical acclaim and her Emmy award. (The award was given jointly to both her and her puppet.)

After receiving the award, Dinsdale was given her own weekly children&#x27;s show (entitled simply &quot;Judy Splinters&quot;), which ran from June 13, 1949, to June 30, 1950, on NBC. It originated at KNBH in Los Angeles and was shown in the Midwest and East via Kinescope. In the years following, she had shows in both Chicago and New York City.

==Post-ventriloquism career==
In 1953, she embarked on the second phase of her life: retiring from show business, getting married and having two children. She remained married till her death.

In 1958, she appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

In 1970, Dinsdale enrolled at the State University of New York at Stony Brook to study respiratory and cardiopulmonary therapy. She graduated class of 1972. Dinsdale served as the head of the Respiratory Therapy Department at John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson, New York, from 1973 to her second retirement in 1986.

==Family==
On July 14, 1953, Dinsdale married Frank Layburn, a field engineer, in Springfield, Massachusetts.

==Death==
She died from cancer on May 9, 1999, at her home in Stony Brook, New York. Survivors included her husband, a son, a daughter, and two grandchildren.

<doc id="957598" wikidata="Q1461865" url="?curid=957598" title="Linda (coordination language)">
<text>In computer science, Linda is a coordination model that aids communication in parallel computing environments. Developed by David Gelernter, it is meant to be used alongside a full-fledged computation language like Fortran or C where Linda&#x27;s role is to &quot;&quot;create&quot; computational activities and to support communication among them&quot;.

== History ==
David Gelernter wrote the first version of Linda as a Ph.D. candidate in 1979, naming it after Linda Lovelace, who appeared in the pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. At the time, the main language for parallel processing was Ada, which Gelernter considered an &quot;inelegant and bulky&quot; language.

It was widely released in 1986, when Gelernter, along with his Yale colleague Nicholas Carriero and Sudhir Ahuja at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, published &quot;Linda and Friends&quot; in an IEEE journal. 

By the early 1990s, Linda was widely used by corporations to more efficiently conduct big data analyses, including Wall Street brokerages as well as AT&amp;T, Boeing, and United Technologies. There were even companies that specialized in creating specialized parallel computing applications based on Linda, the largest of which was Scientific Computing Associates, a New Haven-based company founded by several Yale computer scientists (Gelernter occasionally consulted for them but did not work there). Interest in Linda dropped in the mid-1990s, only to make a comeback in the late 1990s with several corporations implementing Linda in Java, including Sun Microsystems and IBM.

== Overview ==
=== Model ===
The Linda model provides a distributed shared memory, known as a tuple space because its basic addressable unit is a tuple, an ordered sequence of typed data objects; specifically in Linda, a tuple is a sequence of up to 16 typed fields enclosed in parentheses&quot;. The tuple space is &quot;logically shared by processes&quot; which are referred to as workers that store and retrieve tuples.

=== Operations ===
One of Linda&#x27;s main advantages is that it&#x27;s simple, with only six operations that workers perform on the tuples to access tuplespace:
* codice_1: Puts a tuple into the tuplespace
* codice_2: Takes out a tuple that matches a given pattern from the tuplespace (if there&#x27;s no match, the operation is blocked)
* codice_3: Copies a tuple that matches a given pattern from the tuplespace (if there&#x27;s no match, the operation is blocked)
* codice_4: Creates a new process to evaluate tuples
* codice_5: A non-blocking version of codice_2 (if there&#x27;s no match, an error message is returned)
* codice_7: A non-blocking version of codice_3 (if there&#x27;s no match, an error message is returned)

== Comparison ==
Compared to other parallel-processing models, Linda is more orthogonal in treating process coordination as a separate activity from computation, and it is more general in being able to subsume various levels of concurrency—uniprocessor, multi-threaded multiprocessor, or networked—under a single model. Its orthogonality allows processes computing in different languages and platforms to interoperate using the same primitives. Its generality allows a multi-threaded Linda system to be distributed across multiple computers without change.

Whereas message-passing models require tightly coupled processes sending messages to each other in some sequence or protocol, Linda processes are decoupled from other processes, communicating only through the tuplespace; a process need have no notion of other processes except for the kinds of tuples consumed or produced. Criticisms of Linda from the multiprocessing community tend to focus on the decreased speed of operations in Linda systems as compared to Message Passing Interface (MPI) systems. While not without justification, these claims were largely refuted for an important class of problems. Detailed criticisms of the Linda model can also be found in Steven Ericsson-Zenith&#x27;s book &quot;Process Interaction Models&quot;.

Researchers have proposed more primitives to support different types of communication and co-ordination between (open distributed) computer systems, and to solve particular problems arising from various uses of the model. Researchers have also experimented with various means of implementing the virtual shared memory for this model. Many of these researchers proposed larger modifications to the original Linda model, developing a family of systems known as Linda-like systems and implemented as orthogonal technology (unlike original version). An example of this is the language Ease designed by Steven Ericsson-Zenith.

Linda&#x27;s approach has also been compared to that of flow-based programming.

== Linda-calculus ==

The Linda-calculus is a formalisation of the above model with the difference that in the following formula_1 subsumes both out and eval operations.

=== Syntax ===

We abstract the concrete representation of tuples.
We just assume that we have a set of tuples formula_2 and
we are allowed to form and apply a substitution function formula_3 on tuples substituting variables for terms that yields a tuple.
For example, given we have a tuple formula_4, then
applying a substitution formula_5 on formula_6 yields formula_7

The Linda-calculus processes are defined by the following grammar.

formula_8

The syntax includes the aftermentioned Linda operations, non-deterministic choice, and recursion. The substitution function is extended to processes recursively.

=== Semantics ===

A tuple space is represented as a multiset of the processes. We write formula_9 for formula_10 where formula_11 is a multiset, formula_12 a singleton multiset, and formula_13 is the multiset union operation. The semantics is then defined as a reduction relation on a multiset formula_14 as follows.

formula_15

Note that (input) consumes the tuple formula_16 from the tuple space whereas (read) only reads it.
The resulting operational semantics is synchronous.

== Implementations ==
Linda was originally implemented in C and Fortran, but has since been implemented in many programming languages, including:

<text>James Hervey (26 February 1714 – 25 December 1758) was an English clergyman and writer.

==Life==
He was born at Hardingstone, near Northampton, and was educated at the grammar school of Northampton, and at Lincoln College, Oxford. Here he came under the influence of John Wesley and the Oxford Methodists, especially since he was a member of the Holy Club. Ultimately, however, while retaining his regard for the men and his sympathy with their religious aims, he adopted a thoroughly Calvinistic creed, and resolved to remain in the Anglican Church.

Having taken orders in 1737, he held several curacies, and in 1752 succeeded his father in the family livings of Weston Favell and Collingtree. He was never robust, but was a good parish priest and a zealous writer.

==Works==
His style is often bombastic, but he displays a rare appreciation of natural beauty, and his simple piety made him many friends. His earliest work, &quot;Meditations and Contemplations&quot;, said to have been modelled on Robert Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Occasional Reflexions on various Subjects&quot;, within fourteen years passed through as many editions.

&quot;Theron and Aspasio, or a series of Letters upon the most important and interesting Subjects&quot;, which appeared in 1755, and was equally well received, called forth some adverse criticism even from Calvinists, on account of tendencies which were considered to lead to antinomianism, and was strongly objected to by Wesley in his &quot;Preservative against unsettled Notions in Religion&quot;. Besides carrying into England the theological disputes to which the &quot;Marrow of Modern Divinity&quot; had given rise in Scotland (the Marrow controversy), it also led to what is known as the Sandemanian controversy as to the nature of saving faith.

A new and complete edition of his &quot;Works&quot;, with a memoir, appeared in 1797. See also &quot;Collection of the Letters of James Hervey&quot;, to which is prefixed an account of his &quot;Life and Death&quot;, by Thomas Birch (1760).
==Influence==
Hervey had a lasting impact on art through William Blake, who was an admirer of his. Blake painted &quot;Epitome of James Hervey&#x27;s Meditations among the Tombs&quot; between 1820 and 1825.
Hervey is also mentioned in Blake&#x27;s work as one of the holy guards to the &#x27;four-fold gate&#x27;, and his influence on Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Tyger&quot; has also been noted.

In addition to this, the sombre and sweeping tone of his &quot;Meditations Among The Tombs&quot; (for example, &quot;the dreadful pleasure inspired by gazing at fallen monuments and mouldering tombs&quot;) has led to his being placed amongst the 18th century &quot;Graveyard School&quot; of poets, rendering his work an important influence on Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; of 1764 and consequently, the entire genre of Gothic literature and the later Romanticism which the genre fuelled.

<text>The Henry Street Settlement is a not-for-profit social service agency in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City that provides social services, arts programs and health care services to New Yorkers of all ages. It was founded under the name Nurses&#x27; Settlement in 1893 by progressive reformer and nurse Lillian Wald.

==Description==
The Settlement serves about 50,000 people each year. Clients include low-income individuals and families, survivors of domestic violence, youth ages 2 through 21, individuals with mental and physical health challenges, senior citizens, and arts and culture enthusiasts who attend performances, classes and exhibitions at Henry Street&#x27;s Abrons Arts Center.

The Settlement&#x27;s administrative offices are still located in its original (c. 1832) federal row houses at 263, 265 and 267 Henry Street in Manhattan. Services are offered at 17 program sites throughout the area, many of them located in buildings operated by the New York City Housing Authority.

The Settlement&#x27;s buildings at 263, 265 and 267 Henry Street became New York City designated landmarks in 1966. These buildings, along with the Neighborhood Playhouse building at 466 Grand Street, were collectively added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1974 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. The buildings at 265 and 267 Henry Street were re-added to the NRHP in 2022 under the name Lillian Wald House.

==History==
In 1892, Lillian Wald, a 25-year-old nurse then enrolled in the Women&#x27;s Medical College, volunteered to teach a class on home health care for immigrant women at the Louis Down-Town Sabbath and Daily School on the Lower East Side. One day, she was approached by a young girl who kept repeating &quot;mommy ... baby ... blood&quot;. Wald gathered some sheets from her bed-making lesson and followed the child to her home, a cramped two-room tenement apartment. Inside, she found the child&#x27;s mother who had recently given birth and in need of health care. The doctor tending to her had left because she could not afford to pay him. This was Wald&#x27;s first experience with poverty; she called the episode her &quot;baptism by fire&quot; and dedicated herself to bringing nursing care, and eventually education and access to the arts, to the immigrant poor on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. The next year she founded the Nurses&#x27; Settlement, which later changed its name to the Henry Street Settlement.

Two years later, in 1895, Jacob Schiff, a banker and philanthropist purchased the Federal style townhouse at 265 Henry Street for the new organization to use. The building was expanded upwards with an additional story to provide more space, and Schiff donated the building to the Settlement in 1903. The year before, the Settlement had added new facilities, including a gymnasium at 299, 301 and 303 Henry Street.
The organization expanded again in 1906, when Morris Loeb bought the building at 267 Henry Street for it to use. This Greek Revival townhouse was purchased from the Hebrew Technical School for Girls, which had previously employed the architectural firm of Buchman &amp; Fox in 1900 to redo the facade in Colonial Revival style. Alice P. Gannett served as Associate headworker in 1912.

In 1915, the Neighborhood Playhouse, one of the first &quot;Little Theatres&quot;, was created by the sisters Alice and Irene Lewisohn at the corner of Grand and Pitt Streets, offering classical drama for the people of the area. The theater still operates, as the Harry De Jur Playhouse.

In 1927, the Henry Street Music School began operation. It had its formal opening in November 1928. Early supporters of this addition to the settlement included Aaron Copland and Walter Damrosch. In 1937, the school premiered the play-opera &quot;The Second Hurricane&quot;, which featured music by Copland, libretto by Edwin Denby, direction by Orson Welles, and orchestral conduction by Lehman Engel. The director at the time, Grace Spofford, initially suggested the idea of a play-opera for school performers, and was largely responsible for bringing the production together. Alumni of the music school include violinists Berl Senofsky, Stuart Canin, Isidor Lateiner, and Helen Kwalwasser (who later became a faculty member); pianists Martin Canin and Jacob Lateiner; and singer Billie Lynn Daniel. Faculty have included violinist Ivan Galamian, pianist Isabelle Vengerova, bassoonist Stephen Maxym, conductor Arnold Gamson, and composers Paul Creston, Roy Harris, and Robert Starer.

The Settlement began leasing the townhouse at 263 Henry Street, on the other side of its original building, in 1938, using it for classrooms and residences, and in 1949 it purchased the building, which was originally built in the Federal style but had been extensively altered. This combining of the three townhouse – 263, 265 and 267 – had the consequence of preserving part of the 1820s streetscape amid what later became a crowded tenement district. The block of Henry Street between Montgomery Street and Grand Street, which also includes St. Augustine&#x27;s Church, gives an impression of uptown Manhattan as it would have looked in the 1820s and 1830s. #263 Henry Street was restored in 1989 and #265 in 1992.

Henry Street is known for its pioneering efforts in social service and health care delivery. Its innovations included the establishment of one of New York City&#x27;s first off-street playgrounds (1902); funding the first public school nurse (1902); starting the Visiting Nurse Service, which became independent as the Visiting Nurse Service of New York in 1944; opening one of the nation&#x27;s first mental health clinics (1946), one of the first transitional housing facilities for the homeless (1972), the first Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) in public housing (1994) and the city&#x27;s first Safe Haven shelter for homeless women (2007).

In 2018, Sylvia Bloom, a secretary at Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton for 67 years, donated $6.24 million to the settlement&#x27;s Expanded Horizons College Success Program, which helps disadvantaged students prepare for and complete college.

In honor of Henry Street&#x27;s 125th anniversary, American artist, KAWS, collaborated with the Settlement to hold an interactive workshop for art students from the Lower East Side community.

At his passing, actor and comedian Jerry Stiller, bequeathed an undisclosed sum to Henry Street Settlement&#x27;s Abrons Arts Center and Boys &amp; Girls Republic, community programs that aid in the educational and artistic development of Lower Ease Side youth.

In 2021, the New York State Historic Preservation Office approved Henry Street Settlement&#x27;s headquarters at 265–267 Henry Street as an LGBT historic site. The designation is founded upon Lillian Wald&#x27;s romantic and platonic relationships with the women she affectionately called &quot;The Family&quot; (a concept commonly used in women-run settlement houses), who provided an essential support network for her from the 1890s until her retirement in the 1930s.

<text>Samuel Birch (3 November 1813 – 27 December 1885) was a British Egyptologist and antiquarian.
==Biography==
Birch was the son of a rector at St Mary Woolnoth, London. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. From an early age, his manifest tendency to the study of out-of-the-way subjects well suited his later interest in archaeology. After brief employment in the Record Office, he obtained, in 1836, an appointment to the antiquities department of the British Museum. The appointment was due to his knowledge of Chinese, which was unusual at that time. He soon broadened his research to Egyptian. When the cumbrous department came to be divided, he was appointed to head the Egyptian and Assyrian branch.

In the latter language he had assistance, but for many years there was only one other person in the institution, in a different department, who knew anything of ancient Egyptian. The entire arrangement of the department devolved upon Birch. He found time nevertheless for Egyptological work of the highest value, including a hieroglyphical grammar and dictionary, translations of &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; and papyrus Harris I, and numerous catalogues and guides.

He further wrote what was long a standard history of pottery, investigated the Cypriote syllabary, and proved by various publications that he had not lost his old interest in Chinese. Paradoxical in many of his views on things in general, he was sound and cautious as a philologist; while learned and laborious, he possessed much of the instinctive divination of genius.

His grandfather, also named Samuel Birch, was a renowned dramatist and Lord Mayor of London (1814).

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1869.

He died on 27 December 1885 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="957613" wikidata="Q387771" url="?curid=957613" title="Lechuguilla Cave">
<text>At , Lechuguilla Cave is the eighth-longest explored cave in the world and the second deepest () in the continental United States. It is most famous for its unusual geology, rare formations, and pristine condition.

The cave is named for the canyon through which it is entered, which is named for &quot;Agave lechuguilla&quot;, a species of plant found there. Lechuguilla is in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico, United States. Access to the cave is limited to approved scientific researchers, survey and exploration teams, and National Park Service management-related trips.

==Exploration history==
Lechuguilla Cave was known until 1986 as a small, insignificant historic site in the park&#x27;s back country. Small amounts of bat guano were mined from the entrance passages for a year under a mining claim filed in 1914. The historic cave contained a entrance pit known as Misery Hole, which led to of dry, dead-end passages.

The cave was visited infrequently after mining activities ceased. However, in the 1950s, cavers heard wind roaring up from the rubble-choked cave floor. Although no route was obvious, people concluded that cave passages lay below the rubble. Led by Dave Allured, a group of cavers from the Colorado Grotto gained permission from the National Park Service and began digging in 1984. Since the breakthrough into large walking passages occurred on May 25, 1986, explorers have mapped over of passages, making Lechuguilla the eighth-longest cave in the world and fourth-longest in the United States. Lechuguilla was also the deepest known cave in the continental United States at until the exploration of Tears of the Turtle Cave in 2014. Drawn by the cave&#x27;s pristine condition and rare beauty, cavers come from around the world to explore and map its passages and geology.

In May 2012, a team led by Derek Bristol of Colorado climbed over into a dome and discovered several new, unexplored passages, pits, and large rooms. This new section was named &quot;Oz&quot;, and many of its features were named after items from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The discovery included a large room measuring long, up to wide, and up to high. It was named &quot;Munchkinland&quot;. A pit, named &quot;Kansas Twister&quot;, at over from floor to ceiling, is the deepest pit discovered in the park. The team spent eight days mapping Oz, adding the largest distance to the survey since 1989, and bringing the total length to .

==Geology==

Lechuguilla Cave offers more than extreme size. It holds a variety of rare speleothems, including lemon-yellow sulfur deposits, gypsum chandeliers, gypsum hairs and beards, soda straws, hydromagnesite balloons, cave pearls, subaqueous helictites, rusticles, U-loops, and J-loops. Lechuguilla Cave surpasses nearby Carlsbad Caverns in size, depth, and variety of speleothems, though no room has been discovered yet in Lechuguilla Cave that is larger than Carlsbad&#x27;s Big Room.

For the first time, a Guadalupe Mountains cave extends deep enough that scientists may study five separate geologic formations from the inside. The profusion of gypsum and sulfur lends support to speleogenesis by sulfuric acid dissolution. The sulfuric acid is believed to be derived from hydrogen sulfide that migrated from nearby oil deposits. Therefore, this cavern formed from the bottom up, in contrast to the normal top-down carbonic acid dissolution mechanism of cave formation.

Lechuguilla Cave lies beneath a park wilderness area. The cave&#x27;s passages may extend out of the park into adjacent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land. A major threat to the cave is proposed gas and oil drilling on BLM land. Any leakage of gas or fluids into the cave&#x27;s passages could kill cave life or cause explosions.

==Microbiology==
Rare chemolithoautotrophic bacteria are believed to occur in the cave. These bacteria feed on the sulfur, iron, and manganese minerals and may assist in enlarging the cave and determining the shapes of unusual speleothems. The claim in the BBC documentary series &quot;Planet Earth&quot; that these bacteria do not derive any energy from the sun is incorrect, in that sulfur-oxidizing bacteria found in the cave use atmospheric oxygen (derived from sunlight-driven photosynthesis) as an electron acceptor, with the electron donor (source of energy) derived from dissolved groundwater hydrogen sulfide gas.

Other studies indicate that some microbes may have medicinal qualities that are beneficial to humans. Some of the bacterial strains isolated from the cave have been found to harbor novel pathways for antibiotic resistance. A 4 million year-old strain of &quot;Paenibacillus&quot; isolated from soil samples in Lechuguilla Cave was found to be naturally resistant to many modern antibiotics, including daptomycin.

==Filming==
The Denver Museum of Nature and Science filmed one of the first documentaries in the cave, titled &quot;Lechuguilla Cave: The Hidden Giant&quot;, in 1987, featuring many of the cavers responsible for the breakthrough and initial survey work. The video was broadcast on the Denver PBS station KRMA-TV in 1989.

The 1992 National Geographic Society program titled &quot;Mysteries Underground&quot; was also filmed extensively in Lechuguilla Cave.

Lechuguilla Cave was also shown in the BBC documentary series &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. The fourth episode, titled &quot;Caves&quot;, airing on April 22, 2007, documented scientists and filmmakers exploring Lechuguilla Cave, including the Chandelier Ballroom, which has high-quality crystals. The team took two years to get permission to film.

In October 2016, crew members from London-based production company Nutopia descended into Lechuguilla Cave with microbiologist Hazel Barton to film a sequence for season 1, episode 4 (titled &quot;Genesis&quot;) of the National Geographic series &quot;One Strange Rock&quot;.

<text>Hermann Franz Joseph Hubertus Maria Anschütz-Kaempfe (3 October 1872 – 6 May 1931) was a German art historian and inventor. He was born in Zweibrücken and died in Munich.

In his quest to navigate to the North Pole by submarine, he became interested in the concept of the gyrocompass. In 1905 he founded, with Friedrich Treitschke, the company Anschütz &amp; Co (today Anschütz GmbH) in Kiel, Germany. Anschütz was the first firm to manufacture gyroscopic navigation instruments, which Anschütz-Kaempfe designed. One of his staff was Maximilian Schuler, who made the fundamental discovery of Schuler tuning.

<text>The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ironclads were a class of two warships built for the Royal Navy between 1859 and 1862, the first ocean-going ironclads with iron hulls ever constructed. The ships were designed as armoured frigates in response to an invasion scare sparked by the launch of the and her three sisters in 1858. They were initially armed with a mix of rifled breech-loading and muzzle-loading smoothbore guns, but the Armstrong breech-loading guns proved unreliable and were ultimately withdrawn from service.

The ships spent their first commission with the Channel Fleet before being rearmed with new rifled muzzle-loading guns in the late 1860s. rejoined the Channel Fleet after her refit while joined the 1st Class Reserve and joined the fleet during its annual manoeuvres. The two ships exchanged roles after another refit in the mid-1870s. Both ships spent most of the last two decades of the 19th century in . &quot;Warrior&quot; was hulked in 1902 and survived to be restored in 1979 as a museum ship. &quot;Black Prince&quot; became a training ship in 1896 and was hulked in 1910 before being sold for scrap in 1923.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships have been described as revolutionary, but in truth they were more evolutionary than not as everything except their wrought iron armour had been in use by ocean-going ships for years. The naval architect and historian David K. Brown commented, &quot;What made [Warrior] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world.&quot; They were designed in response to &quot;Gloire&quot;, which started an invasion scare in Britain, but they had a very different concept of operation to the French ship which was meant as a replacement for wooden ships of the line. They were designed by Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates largely based on the fine lines of the large frigate . &quot;Warrior&quot; and her sister &quot;Black Prince&quot; were not intended to stand in the line of battle as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two and three-deck ships of the line. Rather they were designed to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought for their own advantage.

===General characteristics===
The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships were long between perpendiculars and long overall. This was longer than the &quot;Mersey&quot;, the longest wooden-hulled ship in the Royal Navy. They had a beam of and a draught of . The ships displaced . The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 92 compartments and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms.

Two bilge keels were fitted (the first used by the Royal Navy), which significantly reduced the roll of the ships. Because of their length the ships proved to be very sluggish while manoeuvring, as &quot;Warrior&quot; proved when she collided with in 1868. The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships down by the bow, not least because they were fitted with a iron knee placed at the bow to give it a traditionally pleasing shape. This also prevented the ships from ramming any other ships. The bowsprit was shortened after completion in an effort to reduce the trim, but it was not noticeably successful.

===Propulsion===

The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships had one 2-cylinder trunk steam engine made by John Penn and Sons driving a single propeller. Ten rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of . The engine produced a total of and was the most powerful thus far built for a warship. On sea trials in October 1861 &quot;Warrior&quot; had a maximum speed around ; &quot;Black Prince&quot; was about a half knot slower. The ships carried of coal, enough to steam at .

The ironclads were ship rigged and had a sail area of . The lower masts were made of wood, but the other masts were iron. &quot;Warrior&quot; made under sail, but &quot;Black Prince&quot; could only do . Under both sail and steam &quot;Warrior&quot; once logged . Both funnels were semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone. The ships&#x27; propellers could be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail. They were the largest hoistable propellers ever made and required about 600 men to be raised.

===Armament===

The armament of the &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships was intended to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading 40-pounder guns as saluting guns. The 40-pounder guns were to have been replaced by 70-pounder guns, but these failed their tests and were never issued. Both breech-loading guns were new designs from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Four of the 110-pounder guns were installed on the main deck amidships and the other two became chase guns; all of the 68-pounder guns were mounted on the main deck. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–1864 forestalled plans to completely equip the ships with the 110-pounder gun.

The solid shot of the 68-pounder gun weighed approximately while the gun itself weighed . The gun had a muzzle velocity of and had a range of at an elevation of 12°. The shell of the 110-pounder Armstrong breech-loader weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and, at an elevation of 11.25°, a maximum range of . The shell of the 40-pounder breech-loading gun was in diameter and weighed . The gun had a maximum range of at a muzzle velocity of . The 110-pounder gun weighed while the 40-pounder weighed . In 1863–1864 the 40-pounder guns were replaced by a heavier version with the same ballistics. All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells.

Both ships were rearmed during their 1867–1868 refit with a mix of 7- and rifled muzzle-loading guns. &quot;Warrior&quot; received twenty-eight 7-inch and four 8-inch guns while &quot;Black Prince&quot; received four fewer 7-inch guns. Both ships received four 20-pounder breech-loading guns for use as saluting guns. The shell of the 15-calibre 8-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The 16-calibre 7-inch gun weighed and fired a shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate armour.

===Armour===

The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships had a wrought-iron armour belt, thick, that covered amidships. The armour extended above the waterline and below it. 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads protected the guns on the main deck. The armour was backed by of teak. The ends of the ship were left entirely unprotected which meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable.

==Construction==
The gun ports of the &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships were built wide, which allowed the 68-pounders to traverse 52°. While the ships were being built the directing bar was developed which consisted of an iron bar that fastened to a pivot bolt in the sill of the gun port. After the gun carriages were modified, this allowed them to pivot much closer to the gun port than had previously been possible and meant that the gun ports could be narrowed to a width of while retaining the same arc of fire. The gun ports were narrowed to the new width by of wrought iron. Another delay was the modification of the armour plates with tongue and groove joints to lock the plates together and increase their resistance to armour-piercing shells. All together these modifications delayed the completion of &quot;Warrior&quot; by a year past her contract completion date.

==Service==
HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; joined the Channel Fleet in July 1862 and was placed in ordinary from 1864 to 1867, during which time she was refitted. The ship rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1867 and towed a floating drydock to Bermuda in 1869 with her sister &quot;Black Prince&quot;. &quot;Warrior&quot; was placed in ordinary again from 1872 to 1875 and was modified with a poop deck. She was recommissioned into the 1st Class Reserve in 1875 and made periodic training cruises until 1883. The ship was formally reclassified as an armoured frigate in 1884, but was disarmed and mastless. &quot;Warrior&quot; was hulked as a depot ship in Portsmouth Harbor in 1902 and renamed &quot;Vernon III&quot; in 1904 when she became part of , the Royal Navy&#x27;s Torpedo School. The ship regained her original name in 1923 and was converted once more into an oil pipeline pier in 1927. &quot;Warrior&quot; was towed to Pembroke Dock in 1929 and was renamed &quot;C77&quot; in 1942 to release her name for the new aircraft carrier . In 1979 &quot;C77&quot; was moved to Hartlepool and was restored as HMS &quot;Warrior (1860)&quot; as the Fleet Headquarters in Northwood, London had assumed the name of HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; in the early 1960s. The ironclad can now be seen near at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.

&quot;Black Prince&quot; capsized while in dock at Greenock, damaging her masts. She arrived in Spithead in November 1861 with only jury-rigged fore and mizzenmasts. The ship was assigned to the Channel Fleet upon her completion and in 1867–68 she was rearmed and then assigned to the 1st Class Reserve. She was refitted in 1874 and given a poop deck, and rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1875 as the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, second in command of the fleet. &quot;Black Prince&quot; was placed in reserve in 1878 in Devonport until she was converted to a training ship in 1896 in Queenstown, Ireland and renamed &quot;Emerald&quot; in 1903. The ship was hulked and renamed &quot;Impregnable III&quot; in 1910 when she was assigned to the training school before she was sold for scrap on 21 March 1923.

<text>Leptines () was an Athenian orator. He is known as the proposer of a law that no Athenian, whether citizen or resident alien (with the sole exception of the descendants of Harmodius and Aristogeiton), should be exempt from the public charges (&quot;leitourgiai&quot;) for the state festivals.

The object was to provide funds for the festivals and public spectacles at a time when both the treasury and the citizens generally were short of money. It was further asserted that many of the recipients of immunity were really unworthy of it. Against this law Demosthenes delivered (354 BC) his well-known speech &quot;Against Leptines&quot; in support of the proposal of Ctesippus that all the cases of immunity should be carefully investigated. Great stress is laid on the reputation for ingratitude and breach of faith which the abolition of immunities would bring upon the state.

Besides, the law itself had been passed unconstitutionally, for an existing law confirmed these privileges, and by the constitution of Solon no law could be enacted until any existing law which it contravened had been repealed. The law was probably condemned. Nothing further is known of Leptines.

See the edition of the speech by JE Sandys (1890).

<text>Marie Elisabeth Zakrzewska (6 September 1829 – 12 May 1902) was a Polish-American physician who made her name as a pioneering female doctor in the United States. As a Berlin native, she found great interest in medicine after assisting her mother, who worked as a midwife. Best known for the establishment of the New England Hospital for Women and Children, she opened doors to many women who were interested in the medical field and provided them with hands-on learning opportunities. Within the New England Hospital, she established the first general training school for nurses in America. Her drive and perseverance made the idea of women in medicine less daunting. She also initiated the creation of the first sand gardens for children in America.

== Early life ==

During the final partition of Poland, Ludwig Martin Zakrzewski and his wife, Caroline Fredericke Wilhelmina Urban, fled to Berlin, Germany, after losing much of his land to Russia. After settling into their new life in Germany, Marie Elizabeth was born on September 6, 1829. She was the eldest of six children&quot;.&quot; Marie Zakrzewska was a bright child and excelled during grade school. Here she exhibited traits that portrayed her as an exceptional student. Her teachers would applaud her for her great successes in school. However, her father did not plan on allowing her to continue in school past the years of acquiring basic skills. Zakrzewska left school at the age thirteen.

After moving to Berlin, Ludwig Zakrzewski first worked as an army official and then as a government official in later years. When he lost his position in the government, he was forced back into the army, reducing his family to poverty. In the years of crisis, Marie&#x27;s mother enrolled in the government school of midwives in Berlin. Once her mother&#x27;s practice became successful, Marie accompanied her as she made rounds to her patients. Zakrzewska learned novel lessons and kept a record of these experiences in her diary. She read any medicinal book that she could get her hands on. Zakrzewska became increasingly interested in the field of nursing and eventually decided to become a midwife.

Zakrzewska applied for admission to the government midwifery school, Royal Charité Hospital in Berlin. She applied at age nineteen and again at twenty, only to be repeatedly rejected. Dr. Joseph Schmidt, a professor at the school, was impressed with her persistence. He was also fascinated with Zakrzewska as he watched her work with her mother. After several applications, Zakrzewska was admitted into the midwifery school when Dr. Schmidt secured her a spot. She was the youngest woman to attend the school, which made her highly visible in the classroom. Regardless of the obstacles that came in her way, she outperformed her fellow classmates and graduated from the program in 1851. Dr. Schmidt was so impressed with Zakrzewska&#x27;s success that he attempted to appoint her a chief midwife with the rank as a professor at the college. No woman had ever held this position and debates arose surrounding this appointment. Many believed that because men would surround her, she would fall in love, thus ending her career. Despite the challenges, Zakrzewska was appointed to the position at age twenty-two. She was responsible for more than two hundred students, men included. Zakrzewska&#x27;s mentor died only a few hours after she assumed the position. Without Dr. Schmidt supporting her role as chief midwife, protests led to her early dismissal after only six months in the position.

== Moving to America ==
After her resignation from the role as chief midwife at the Royal Charité Hospital in Berlin and studying medicine there, Zakrzewska set off to start a new life in America with her sister, Anna Zakrzewska. Marie yearned to find vast opportunities to practice medicine as a woman in America. In 1853, Marie and her sister reached New York. After connecting with a family friend, a physician, she realized that female physicians faced considerable disadvantages in the United States. It was extremely difficult for Marie to find a job assisting a male physician, let alone establish her own practice. The Zakrzewska sisters&#x27; funds were dwindling and to survive, they settled for sewing embroidered worsted materials. They sold these materials in the marketplace and earned as much as a dollar per day.

Although her business was flourishing, Zakrzewska could not help but desire a life of practicing medicine. A year after arriving in New York, she visited the Home for the Friendless, which was well known for its support of immigrants. It was here that she was introduced to Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman in the United States to obtain her degree in medicine from a college established solely for men. Zakrzewska was excited to meet a fellow woman who shared the same passion for medicine. Following her meeting, Zakrzewska was invited to join the staff at the Blackwell&#x27;s dispensary.

Blackwell arranged for Zakrzewska&#x27;s entry into the Western Reserve University&#x27;s medical program that was unique in accepting female students. With her acceptance, she had to be willing to learn sufficient English. As she was planning to move out west to attend the program, she ran into further obstacles. She was one of only four women out of two hundred students attending the medical school. Two of the other women, Dr. Cordelia A. Greene, of Castile, New York  and Dr. Elizabeth Griselle, of Salem, Ohio, would become life-long friends. No one wanted to share an apartment with a female doctor, so Blackwell arranged for temporary housing at the home of Caroline Severance. The men on campus welcomed her with disgust and hostility. They petitioned the institution to refuse to enroll the women after the winter term. Despite the bumpy road, she obtained her medical degree in March 1856 at the age of twenty-seven.

After receiving her degree in medicine, she returned to New York to find a job. Though it was difficult to find a job as a midwife, she hoped that the search would be easier with a medical degree. She quickly found out that it was no different as a woman. As a lady &quot;doctor,&quot; her presence in public received scornful looks and Zakrzewska was quickly ostracized by the public. Eventually, Elizabeth Blackwell used the back parlor of her house as a doctor&#x27;s office where Zakrzewska hung her physician&#x27;s shingle for the first time. The tiresome rejections and repeated obstacles to practicing medicine that Blackwell and Zakrzewska encountered sparked the idea of creating their own infirmary to meet the medical demands of women and children. They traveled together and held events to raise money for their grand idea. On May 1, 1857, the New York Infirmary for Women and Children was in business. By 1859, the New York Infirmary stood on a solid foundation of funds with a growing number of patients. A typical day for Zakrzewska began at 5:30 a.m. and did not end until 11:30 p.m.

Zakrzewska traveled to Boston as her desire for a greater challenge grew. She fell in love with the city and was offered an appointment as Professor of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children as well as to serve as head of a new clinical program at the Boston Female Medical College. Zakrzewska found that the people of Boston were more supportive of a female physician than those whom she encountered in New York. When the founder of the college, Samuel Gregory, insisted that graduating female physicians would be addressed as &quot;doctresses&quot; instead of doctor, Zakrzewska resigned from her position in 1861.

=== The New England Hospital for Women and Children ===
Reflecting on the many obstacles she encountered in her life, Zakrzewska decided that she wanted to aid aspiring female doctors in some way. She believed that women were in desperate need of a hospital in which they were not denied the facilities for clinical instruction and could practice medicine. The New England Hospital for Women and Children opened its doors on July 1, 1862. The goals of this college were to provide women with medical treatment from physicians of their own sex, to provide women with the opportunity to experience the clinical application of medicine, and to train nurses. She stressed her intentions to prove that women were just as capable as men to run a hospital and practice medicine.

The New England Hospital was not the only hospital in Boston that offered care for women and children. However, it was unique in that it offered clinical practice to female physicians. For Zakrzewska, it was one thing to study information and be lectured to in the classroom. However, many females were denied the opportunity to practice medicine from a hands-on perspective, which to Zakrzewska, is key to becoming an extraordinary physician. It was also the first hospital in Boston to offer gynecological and obstetrical care and the first hospital in America to offer a general training school for nurses. They offered most of their care to the poor for free or little cost by accepting donations from their supporters.

Her staff grew over the years and included such notable physicians as Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, Lucy E. Sewall, Dr. Anita Tyng, and Dr. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch.

== Later life ==
Marie Zakrzewska sought admission into a professional medical society. One of the primary goals for women physicians was to gain acceptance by their peers and society. Admittance into a medical society was a vital way to achieve this because it would signal their social acceptance amongst their male colleagues, and thus the public. Her fellow male physicians encouraged her to apply to the Massachusetts Medical Society. Zakrzewska soon after applied for the honor. Even with the encouragement from the colleagues, they were unable to outvote her opponents. She was rejected from the professional medical society based on her gender.

Hoping to open medical schools to women, Zakrzewska, along with Emily Blackwell, Lucy Sewell, Helen Morton, Mary Putnam Jacobi, and many other women, sent a letter to Harvard University. They offered $50,000 to establish a medical program for women. The university denied this offer. Their hopes were not shaken. This offer was accepted by Johns Hopkins University and opened its doors to women the successive year.

After many hard-fought years practicing medicine and establishing accessible medical education for women, Zakrzewska retired in 1890. She spent the rest of her life consulting on projects and arranging affairs. In 1899, the main building of the hospital would be renamed the &quot;Zakrzewska Building.&quot; Marie Zakrzewska died a few years later on May 12, 1902 in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts due to what was thought to be a heart attack. During her service, her colleagues and friends gathered to pay their respects, reading farewell letters that Zakrzewska had written for the occasion. Her home is a site on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail and

Zakrzewska lived a successful life, breaking barriers that hindered women in practicing medicine in the United States, founded hospitals for women, and pioneered the movement that opened the nursing profession to black women with the first black nurse in America graduating from the school in 1879. As a feminist and abolitionist, she became friends with William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and Karl Heinzen.

== Role in early playground movement ==
Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska introduced to America the German idea to build sand gardens for children, starting in the city of Boston, inspired by the German sand gardens she observed while visiting Berlin in the summer of 1885.

<text>The United Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (, PSTU) is a Trotskyist party in Brazil. It is the largest section of the International Workers&#x27; League (Fourth International) (LIT), an international body of groups in the Morenoist tradition.

==History==

===Early history===
The origins of the PSTU can be traced to 1972 when a number of Brazilian militants from a variety of political backgrounds contacted the reunified Fourth International (FI). These militants formed the Starting Point group in Salvador Allende&#x27;s Chile, only to find themselves dispersed in 1973 when Allende&#x27;s government was overthrown. Some members of Turning Point fled to Argentina and founded the Workers League.

Returning to Brazil in 1974, the Workers League commenced publication of the magazine &quot;Workers Independence&quot; and recruited new members from within the student movement. By 1977 the group had grown to 300 members. At that point, Nahuel Moreno of the Argentinian Socialist Workers Party (PST) organised the &quot;Bolshevik Faction&quot; within the FI, to which the Workers League adhered.

In 1978, the Workers League formed the Movimento Convergência Socialista (CS) as part of a tactic aimed at the establishment of a new mass socialist party. The Workers League also renamed itself the Socialist Workers Party (PST). Later in the year a number of members were jailed, alongside them Nahuel Moreno. An international campaign for their release won the support of Gabriel García Márquez.

By 1979, CS was part of a growing campaign for a new Workers&#x27; Party and played an important role in the metal working strikes that took place in the ABC region that year. In January the PST fully integrated itself into the CS ending its separate organisational form. The following year again saw CS taking a role in the important 40-day strike in the ABC region. Its own growth was marked by the attendance of 3,000 people at a rally of the CS and Moreno&#x27;s international tendency, then linked to Pierre Lambert&#x27;s France-based tendency. By 1982 Moreno and Lambert had parted company and the former organised the International Workers&#x27; League (Fourth International) to which CS affiliated.

In the early 1980s, CS took part in the founding of the Central Unica dos Trabalhadores (CUT) union centre as strikes spread through Brazil along with other forms of social unrest. They were also to form part of the Workers&#x27; Party when it was founded in 1980 and recognised officially by the state in 1982. As an officially recognised platform or faction of the PT, the CS saw a number of its members elected to national, state and local legislative bodies during the 1980s.

===Recent history===
The affiliation of CS with the PT was not to last and by late 1991 the leadership of the latter was concerned at the activities of some PT factions particularly CS. This situation arose due to the involvement of CS in extra-parliamentary struggles and deepened in 1992 as the CS campaigned against the government of Fernando Collor de Mello and the International Monetary Fund. The situation continued to deteriorate and in June CS was expelled from PT. In response the CS formed the Revolutionary Front which at a Congress in April 1993 became the PSTU with the fusion of CS into the new party alongside a number of smaller groups including Democracia Operária (RS), the PFS, MSR (PE), Liga and the CS. 21 of April Movement.

Since then the PSTU has continued as a persistent presence in the Brazilian labour and social movements to the left of the PT. It has lost a number of members in splits, most recently to the newly formed PSOL, which it refused to become a part of. It contests national and local elections and is involved in social movements, particularly the labor movement and student movement. The PSTU publishes the weekly newspaper &quot;Opinião Socialista&quot; (&quot;Socialist Opinion&quot;) and is the main group contributing to the journal &quot;Marxism Alive/Marxismo Vivo&quot;.

The PSTU is the Brazilian section of the International Workers League – Fourth International (Lit) with which the Italian Progetto Comunista - Rifondare l&#x27;Opposizione dei Lavoratori (PC-ROL) has for a long time had a close political relationship and mutual collaboration. The PSTU is also the main force of the Brazilian extreme left and first took part in elections in the Third Pole that supported the candidacy of Heloísa Helena Lima de Moraes Carvalho, former member of the PT (the party of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva) expelled from the PT with others for her opposition to the reform of pensions (in 2008 she became leader of the Socialism and Liberty Party with Ivan Valente and Luciana Genro).

In the 2010 presidential election, the PSTU candidate received 0.08% of votes (88,000).

<text>The Democratic Labour Party (, PDT) is a political party in Brazil.

==History==
The Democratic Labour Party (PDT) was founded in 1979 by left-wing leader Leonel Brizola as an attempt to reorganise the Brazilian left-wing forces during the end of the Brazilian military dictatorship. Many of its members, including Brizola, had been active in the historical Brazilian Labour Party prior to the 1964 coup, which drove into exile or assassinated a number of its prominent members including ousted President João Goulart. Returning from exile in Uruguay, Brizola originally wanted to reclaim the PTB name for his party, but the military government awarded it to a more moderate grouping led by Ivete Vargas, leading to PDT being formed by a large majority of historical PTB members a week later. The PDT joined the Socialist International in 1986. It was the major left-wing party in Brazil until the rise of the Workers&#x27; Party (PT) in 1994.

The Socialist Youth, founded in 1981, was originally called Labour Youth. Its name had been changed twice: in 1984, to Socialist Labour Youth, and then to Socialist Youth in 1985. The intention was to support the group that defended the participation of the party in the Socialist International as well as the change of the party&#x27;s name to Socialist Party. The latter never happened, partly due to the founding of the Brazilian Socialist Party.

PDT enjoyed wide, but regionalized electoral success in the 1980s and 1990s, with Brizola winning the governorship of the Rio de Janeiro state, becoming the first and only Brazilian to have governed two different states, previously his native Rio Grande do Sul before the coup and while leading a civil resistance campaign which had successfully delayed an earlier coup attempt in 1962. Meanwhile, it also elected Alceu Collares for the latter&#x27;s governorship, the first Black Brazilian governor in history. 

The best result of the party in a presidential election was reached by historical leader Brizola, with 17% of the votes in the first round of the 1989 presidential elections. However, Brizola lost to rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva by a margin of 0.5%, stopping him from facing the right-wing candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, in the runoff. Brizola lost two more additional bids in 1994, and 1998, as Lula&#x27;s running mate. In 2002 it launched Ciro Gomes, but later supported Lula in the runoffs as he won in his fourth presidential attempt. 

In the 2002 legislative elections, the party won 21 out of the 513 seats of the Chamber of Deputies and five out of the 81 seats of the Senate. Its candidate also won the gubernatorial election in Amapá. Differences with PT, which had accumulated over the 90s as they disputed for similar voter bases, led to an early breakway from the Lula administration, and PDT entered the opposition. 

In the local elections of October 2004, the party elected 300 mayors, 3252 city councilors, earning 5.5 million votes. Brizola&#x27;s death in June that year resulted in a decade of stagnation.

After the political crisis involving the government of Lula, the PDT has received the affiliation of several left-wing leaders from the president&#x27;s party, the Workers&#x27; Party (PT), that disagree with the government policies, including the former Minister of Education, Cristovam Buarque. Cristovam faced president Lula in the first round of the 2006 National Elections, reaching 4th place (with 2.538.834 or 2.64% of the votes). At the legislative elections of October 1, 2006, the party experienced slight gains, winning 24 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The PDT held onto the governorship of Amapá, and won a surprising victory in the gubernatorial election in Maranhão, which however was overturned due to electoral irregularities in 2009. At the 2010 elections, the PDT made gains in Parliament, winning 28 representatives, and it will have 4 Senate seats. It did not win any governorships, however, and only made it to one gubernatorial runoff, in Alagoas.

The PDT was the first party of president Dilma Rousseff (now in PT). Although the PDT voted against the impeachment of Rousseff, six deputies voted in favor, resulting in the suspension of five deputies and the expulsion of the sixth, Giovani Cherini.

In 2018, the party announced Ciro Gomes, former Minister of Finance (1994-1995) and governor from the state of Ceará (1991-1994), to run for the presidency, receiving 12.47% of the votes in the first round, the second highest by a PDT candidate, second only to Leonel Brizola&#x27;s bid, in 1989. Despite being against the winner of the first round, and the eventual president elected, Jair Bolsonaro, he did not formally endorse Fernando Haddad. It launched Gomes for president again in 2022.

==Ideology==

The PDT combines a pro-labour, democratic socialistic and social-democratic orientation with nationalism. Apart from a small truce in 1998, the PT and PDT had a rivalry for more than 20 years for the leadership of Brazilian left. The PDT eventually lost the battle and became an ally of the PT on the national level. The alliance, however, was always uneasy; the party always had a strong dissident wing led by the former Federal District governor, former &quot;petista&quot; and senator for the Federal District Cristovam Buarque. This internal movement was always ousted and disenfranchised by the national chairman of the party, Carlos Lupi, who was always loyal to the PT government. However, many dissidents left the PDT for other parties, such as the Brazilian Socialist Party, Popular Socialist Party, Brazilian Social Democracy Party or Socialism and Liberty Party.

With the arrival of Ciro Gomes and the crisis within the PT, PDT sought to regain the leadership of the left in the post-2014 elections. The move was partially successful: the PDT made significant gains in the municipal elections of 2016 and won more mayoral races than any party of the left apart from the PSB, while PT&#x27;s own seats fell by 60%. Ciro Gomes, despite having a comparatively much smaller campaign and multiple deals on PT&#x27;s part to sway other parties, mainly PSB, away from PDT, managed to finish in third place. In the runoff, Fernando Haddad, supported by former President Lula, then in jail, expected support from Ciro but this was ignored, and PDT instead assumed a position of neutrality. From 2019 onwards, PDT kept struggling with PT for leadership of the left.
==Logo==
The current logo is the fist and rose, based on the version created by José María Cruz Novillo for the Spanish Socialist Workers Party in 1977. In the logo introduced in 2021, the leafs and stem bear the main colours of the flag of Brazil (yellow, blue and green): party president Carlos Lupi stated that this was in response to the political use of the national flag by President Jair Bolsonaro.

<doc id="957641" wikidata="Q7654891" url="?curid=957641" title="Swedish Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry">
<text>The Swedish Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry (Sif, formerly &quot;Svenska Industritjänstemannaförbundet&quot;) was the largest trade union for white-collar workers in Sweden.

Founded on 21 June 1920 at a conference in Jönköping, the union set up headquarters in Malmö, but moved to Stockholm in 1932. It stated its primary goal as being &quot;to guarantee a good working life for its members&quot;. A main priority was taking part in the collective bargaining process. Workplace health and safety issues, competence and career issues were other major concerns. The organization also played an active part lobbying politicians in the interest of its members.

On formation, the union had just 653 members. It grew steadily, absorbing the Association of Stockholm Technicians in 1930, the Association of Timber Industry Employees in 1937, the National Association of Oil Employees in 1938, and the Swedish Association of Works Employees in 1940. It had 36,500 members in 1945, 107,136 in 1960, and a peak of 305,297 in 2001. The members worked in the private sector, in companies that operated in areas including IT, telecom, construction, manufacturing and research and development. A small number was self-employed. Membership was also open to students. Around 40 percent of the members were women, as was the final President, Mari-Ann Krantz, who after the fusion with HTF became the first President of Unionen.

The organization was not only one of the largest labour unions in Sweden, it was also one of the wealthiest. It had funds worth several hundred million dollars, allowing the union to set aside substantial money for large ad campaigns with the object of recruiting new members.

The organization had in the end of its existence 20 Regional Divisions with 23 local offices around Sweden and approximately 2.500 local union branches in the workplaces. About half the members did not belong to a local branch but could turn to a workplace representative acting as a point of contact and a channel for information.

The highest decision-making body was the Congress, held every four years. It consisted of 180 elected representatives from the workplaces. The Congress elected the 11 representatives of the Sif Executive.

The Swedish Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry maintained independence from party politics. The organization was an affiliate of the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees. It was also a member of several international industrial federations, such as Union Network International, a federation of unions in the IT, telecom, media &amp; entertainment and graphics sector.

In 2008, the union merged with the Swedish Union of Commercial Salaried Employees to form Unionen.

<doc id="957647" wikidata="Q1141350" url="?curid=957647" title="Invisible Touch">
<text>Invisible Touch is the thirteenth studio album by the English rock band Genesis, released on 6 June 1986 by Atlantic Records in the United States and on 9 June 1986 by Charisma/Virgin Records in the United Kingdom. After taking a break in 1984 for each member to continue his solo career, the band reconvened in October 1985 to write and record &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; with engineer and producer Hugh Padgham. As with their previous album, it was written entirely through group improvisations and no material developed prior to recording was used.

&quot;Invisible Touch&quot; was a worldwide success and reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It remains the band&#x27;s highest selling album after it was certified multi-platinum for over 1.2 million copies sold in the UK and 6 million sold in the US. Genesis became the first band and foreign act to have five singles from one album reach the top five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; being their first and only song to reach No. 1 on the charts. The album received mixed reviews upon its release and retrospectively, with its more pop-oriented approach and perceived similarities to lead singer Phil Collins&#x27; solo work receiving both praise and criticism. In 2007, the album was re-released with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes.

==Background==
In February 1984, the band completed their 1983–1984 tour in support of their previous album &quot;Genesis&quot; (1983), which became their biggest selling album at the time of release and spawned the UK top five hit &quot;Mama&quot;. The group followed this with a period of inactivity to allow each member to continue their respective solo careers; Mike Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics and had success with their debut album, Tony Banks concentrated on film scores and released &quot;Soundtracks&quot; (1986), and Phil Collins released his third solo album &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; (1985), which was a major worldwide commercial hit. In the summer of 1985, towards the end of his solo tour, Collins confirmed that Genesis had agreed to start work on a new album that October. This put an end to a false announcement that aired on BBC Radio 1 suggesting the three had split. Rutherford felt that the break affected the group&#x27;s musical style: &quot;We had done so much work outside the band, it seemed we had gone through a lot more musical changes, although the development is largely unconscious.&quot;

==Writing and recording==
&quot;Invisible Touch&quot; was recorded between October 1985 and February 1986 at The Farm, the band&#x27;s private recording studio in Chiddingfold, Surrey. They were joined by engineer and producer Hugh Padgham, who had worked with the band since &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981) and produced the album with the group, with Paul Gommersall as assistant engineer. Earlier in 1985, the studio was upgraded to a plan supervised by Masami &quot;Sam&quot; Toyishima.
The group approached the writing sessions for &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; with a greater sense of confidence, as they had now become a big live act in the US and had reached a new level of commercial success worldwide. As with &quot;Genesis&quot;, they entered the studio with no preconceived ideas and developed songs from recorded jams and improvisations, a process Collins compared to as &quot;close to jazz&quot;. The group considered their strongest songs were those arranged in this way, so they repeated this approach for &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;. Collins said: &quot;You never quite know what&#x27;s going to happen. It&#x27;s just the three of us chopping away, fine-tuning and honing down all these ideas.&quot; A typical session saw the trio work from 11am to as late as 2am the following morning, and start with Collins setting up a drum pattern on the drum machine so Banks and Rutherford could jam ideas. Collins would then sing vocal lines, which created an atmosphere and the basis for a song. Collins recalled his impetuous attitude during the writing sessions and suggested bits of songs be pieced together as early as possible, but Banks and Rutherford were reluctant to do so. Many of the songs on the album evolved from Banks using the recording function on his E-mu Emulator to capture sounds in the studio, and listening back for potential sounds and rhythms that could be used in a song. The keyboard allowed just 17 seconds to be recorded.
The album features Collins playing on a Simmons electronic drum kit. In order to capture more of a sound from the Simmons kit rather than feeding it directly into the mixing desk, Padgham also fed the tracks through a mixer and into a PA system before playing it &quot;very, very loud&quot; in the studio. Padgham later said that the Simmons sounded &quot;a bit thin and toneless.&quot; Collins also used a Roland Pad-8, an electronic pad that triggers percussion sounds from the MIDI instruments used on the album, including a Roland TR-727 drum machine with Latin-inspired samples and Collins&#x27; own E-mu Emulator.

After several jams had been put down on tape, the band listened back to them and picked out the strongest moments with the aim of arranging them into a song. A drum machine was used to create a guiding rhythm, before the guitar and keyboard parts were fully arranged and re-recorded before Collins would replace the drum machine with his own drums last. The band discussed a song&#x27;s potential length, and whether to write lyrics for it or keep it as an instrumental. The lyrics to a track were written after the music was recorded, and were penned by a single member as the group considered the individual had a strong enough direction to carry the song&#x27;s message through. Collins wrote the words for &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight&quot;, and &quot;In Too Deep&quot;; Rutherford wrote for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; and &quot;Throwing It All Away&quot;; Banks wrote &quot;Domino&quot; and &quot;Anything She Does&quot;.

The group arranged a greater number of songs for &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; than before, which required additional time to select which tracks to release. This was not the case with &quot;Genesis&quot;, where strong enough ideas were more scarce; Banks said that &quot;if a song was around, we put it on&quot;. Rutherford noted that &quot;Genesis&quot; had a dark mood to it, yet &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; had a bigger energy. During the writing sessions Collins realised the band were coming up with fresh and unique material that it had not done before, &quot;which is not easy after 15 albums&quot;, and considered them stronger than those on &quot;Genesis&quot;. Banks maintained this view, thinking the shorter tracks on &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; were stronger than the previous album.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;Invisible Touch&quot; originated as the band were working on &quot;The Last Domino&quot;, the second part of &quot;Domino&quot;. During the session Rutherford began to play an improvised guitar riff with an added echo effect, to which Collins replied with the off-the-cuff lyric, &quot;She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah&quot;. This led to Collins writing the lyrics to the song, with his improvised line becoming its chorus hook. He wrote the lyrics based around a person who gets under one&#x27;s skin which he had &quot;Known a few. You know they’re going to mess you up, but you can&#x27;t resist&quot;. Collins later said that &quot;large chunks&quot; of the lyrics are about his first wife Andrea Bertorelli, to whom he was married from 1975 to 1980. The group wanted to keep the song simple in structure, but thought an eight-bar bridge with a key change and using a sequenced keyboard part complemented the arrangement. Banks produced eight different versions in step time, some ideas for which he had thought of ahead of time while others were a rough improvisation. The chosen version was the &quot;most random&quot; one. As the band performed &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; in a lower key on tour, Banks had to produce a new sequenced section which was &quot;a real drag&quot; as he was unable to make one as strong as the one on the album. Rutherford expressed a desire for the band to explore different musical themes for the song, but later felt the lyric had &quot;always felt so comfortable&quot; to him and saw no reason to change it. Collins rates the track highly and picked it as his favourite Genesis song. He added: &quot;It&#x27;s a great pop song. It encapsulated the whole record and it pushed Genesis into a bit of an R&amp;B area, a little like a Prince thing&quot;, and also compared his drumming on the track to American singer Sheila E, of whom he is a fan.

The basis for &quot;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight&quot; came about from Banks, who spent some time improvising with different keyboard sounds over a rhythm Collins and Rutherford were playing. Similar to that of &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, Collins then came out with the word &quot;monkey&quot; and explored it vocally which led to the song&#x27;s working title to be &quot;Monkey/Zulu&quot;. The rest of the lyrics were then written around the word. Rutherford thought the track resembled the &quot;old-style Genesis&quot; as it covers more ground musically with a &quot;fairly involved&quot; instrumental section in the middle. Banks agreed with Rutherford&#x27;s view on the song, pointing out its complexity.

The lyrics to &quot;Land Of Confusion&quot; were written by Rutherford, and they were the last set of words written for the album. Rutherford was behind schedule to get the lyrics to the song finished, but thought the &quot;time was right&quot; for him to write a protest song. He was struck with the flu when it was time for Collins to record the song&#x27;s vocals. He recalled Collins &quot;came over to my house ... he sat on my bed like a secretary ... I was in a kind of delirious state with a very high temperature and I dictated it to him and I remember thinking, &#x27;I think I told him the right thing ... Was it all rubbish or was it any good?.

The lyrics to &quot;In Too Deep&quot; were written by Collins after he was approached to write a song for the soundtrack of the British crime drama film &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986). He wrote the chorus during some spare time at a hotel in Sydney, Australia, but he was unable to write verses for it until the band were recording the song in the studio. They had difficulty in writing a chorus, so Collins suggested the part that he had written.

=== Side two ===
Banks gained inspiration for &quot;Anything She Does&quot; from pictures of scantily clad women the band would cut out and place on the wall of their recording studio. It features a brass sound that Banks sampled from &quot;some tape&quot; that he had; he clarified that the brass was not from the Phenix Horns, the brass section for Earth, Wind and Fire that were previously used on &quot;Abacab&quot;.

&quot;Domino&quot; is a track split into two sections—&quot;In the Glow of the Night&quot; and &quot;The Last Domino&quot;. Banks wrote the lyrics based on the idea that politicians often fail to think through their ideas and the consequences of their actions. Rutherford thinks &quot;Domino&quot; is &quot;one of the best things&quot; the band has done. He was aware that due to the popularity of MTV and the increased pressure to deliver hit singles, people would often forget about their longer songs like &quot;Domino&quot; in favor of the shorter, more commercial hits.

&quot;Throwing It All Away&quot; developed from a guitar riff from Rutherford, who also wrote the lyrics. Collins described it as like a &quot;one-note samba&quot;. It was a heavy guitar song in its original form, with Collins &quot;drumming in a John Bonham style&quot;. As the chorus developed, its mood changed to that of a softer one &quot;matched by the single love-song lyric&quot;.

&quot;The Brazilian&quot; is an instrumental based around a sample that Banks had recorded on his E-mu Emulator playing throughout the track, which he achieved by sticking a knife onto the keyboard. He realised he could have done it electronically, but the knife &quot;looks better that way.&quot; Collins recalled it was put together when the group were &quot;fooling around&quot; in the studio, and he had been experimenting with sounds that could be programmed into his Simmons kit.

===Additional material===
Three additional songs - &quot;Do the Neurotic,&quot; &quot;Feeding The Fire,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be You&quot; - were recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions but were cut from the album&#x27;s final track selection. They were subsequently released as B-sides across the five singles released from the album. The tracks were included in the 2007 box set &quot;Genesis 1983–1998&quot; as well as the 2000 box set &quot;Genesis Archive 2: 1976–1992&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover art was designed by 26-year-old David Baker (known as &quot;Baker Dave&quot;) of Assorted iMaGes, who had previously designed the sleeve for &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; and several of Collins&#x27;s singles. The band had no music prepared and no title at the time of the first briefing, but wanted a design that combined the personality of each member and the outer sleeve to not contain a group photograph. Baker produced several rough designs and presented them to the band for feedback, by which point some music had been put down and the album&#x27;s title had been agreed upon. Baker took the themes suggested by the title and produced fifteen ideas, one of which was a graphical representation of how the inner ear takes in sound. Another was the image of a transparent hand which all three members liked, and Baker used that with a schematic design of a sound wave pattern with an image of a nuclear family in the background.

==Release==
&quot;Invisible Touch&quot; was first released on 6 June 1986 in the US by Atlantic Records; its release in the United Kingdom followed on 9 June 1986 by Charisma and Virgin Records. The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart for three weeks from 21 June 1986 during a 96-week stay on the chart, and peaked at No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during an 85-week stay.

Genesis released five singles from &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; from 1986 to 1987—&quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, &quot;Throwing It All Away&quot;, &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;, &quot;In Too Deep&quot;, and &quot;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight&quot;. Each one reached the top five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, making Genesis the first group and foreign act to achieve this feat, equalling the five singles record set by Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Madonna.

In 1987, Genesis received an American Music Award nomination for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group. At the Brit Awards in 1987 co-producer Hugh Padgham was nominated for British Producer, while Collins was nominated for British Male Artist for his contribution to the album. In 1988, the band received one of the only two Grammy Awards issued for the short-lived Best Concept Music Video category for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;. It was also nominated for MTV&#x27;s Video of the Year Award, but lost to their former lead vocalist Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;. &quot;The Brazilian&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, but lost to the instrumental rock piece &quot;Top Gun Anthem&quot; by Harold Faltermeyer and Steve Stevens.

In 2007, the album was reissued with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix.

==Critical reception==

The album received a mixed reaction from music critics upon release. J. D. Considine gave it a positive review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, stating that &quot;every tune is carefully pruned so that each flourish delivers not an instrumental epiphany but a solid hook. Much of the credit for this belongs to Tony Banks, whose synth style has never seemed more appropriate; it&#x27;s his keyboards that set the mood for &#x27;In the Glow of the Night&#x27; and maintain the tension in &#x27;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight&#x27;.&quot; Daniel Brogan of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was not as impressed, saying the album had &quot;none of the inventiveness, illumination or power&quot; of former Genesis singer Peter Gabriel&#x27;s album &quot;So&quot;, released the prior month. He thought the contributions from Rutherford and Banks &quot;seem far less apparent than usual&quot;, and that the first side of the album &quot;could almost pass as outtakes from &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;&quot;. He concluded: &quot;Will the Free World ever tire of Phil Collins?&quot; Several of Brogan&#x27;s criticisms were mirrored in a review from Steve Hochman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Hochman asked &quot;Was this record really necessary?&quot; and stated the album &quot;could easily pass as a Collins album. His thin voice and familiar MOR&amp;B songwriting dominate, with only occasional evidence of input from Rutherford and Banks&quot;. He also suggested the record &quot;was made to provide material for the next season of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;&quot;. Associated Press writer Larry Kilman disagreed, who opened his review with &quot;Genesis have come up with an irresistible &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; ... This is far from a Collins solo effort. The band&#x27;s material is more complex than Collins&#x27; pop sound&quot;. He complimented the album&#x27;s &quot;great variety&quot;, picking out &quot;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight&quot; as a highlight which reminded him of &quot;the spare, art-rock sound of the early Genesis&quot;.

In a retrospective review from Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic, the album received three stars out of five. He commented that &quot;&quot;Invisible Touch&quot; was seen at the time as a bit of a Phil Collins solo album disguised as a Genesis album ... Genesis&#x27; poppiest album, a sleek, streamlined affair built on electronic percussion and dressed in synths&quot; and he said &quot;the heavy emphasis on pop tunes does serve the singer, not the band&quot;. He said that &quot;[the] songs had big hooks that excused their coldness, and the arty moments sank to the bottom&quot;. Mark Putterford of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; remarked on how the album showed &quot;new ideas, new sounds, but still very definitely Genesis&quot;. &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; describes &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; as &quot;calculated and oddly emotionless AOR&quot; and stated the hits were &quot;by now barely distinguishable from Collins&#x27; songs as a solo artist&quot;. In 2014, Stevie Chick, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said the album&#x27;s &quot;bright, polished pop title track, the baby boomer agit-rock of &#x27;Land of Confusion&#x27;, the genuinely affecting ballad &#x27;Throwing It All Away&#x27; – could have easily fitted on his [Collins&#x27;s] solo albums&quot;. Chick reserved particular praise for &quot;Domino&quot;, saying the track &quot;proved a final gasp of brilliance before the blandness of 1991&#x27;s &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; and 1997&#x27;s inexplicable, Collins-less &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; ranked &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; as the 13th best album by Genesis, stating &quot;On the dark day in Genesis history when this record was released, the band fully transitioned from art-rock glory to radio-ready piffle, replete with all the worst that &#x27;80s overproduction had to offer. The fact that just the tiniest bit of the &#x27;old&#x27; Genesis is discernible in a couple of tracks is the only thing that edges this album a notch ahead of &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;.&quot;

==Tour==
The Invisible Touch Tour consisted of 112 shows between September 1986 and July 1987. The core trio were joined by their longtime touring musicians, drummer Chester Thompson and guitarist/bassist Daryl Stuermer. Every song on &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; was performed live during the tour, except for &quot;Anything She Does&quot; which was used during the show&#x27;s introduction. The 1986 dates included a Genesis medley that included the final two sections of &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; from &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972). The stage production included 400 Vari-Lites which required five lorries to transport.

The tour opened with a sold out North American leg which included five nights at Madison Square Garden and also five at the Los Angeles Forum. Each date on the leg grossed an average of $300,000. The US legs were sponsored by Michelob beer. It was followed by the band&#x27;s first and only tour of Australia and New Zealand; the former dates saw Genesis perform &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; from &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (1976) with a string section. A Chinese leg was announced, but later cancelled. The tour ended with four sold out shows at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium, totalling 288,000 people in attendance, which set a new record. The final show was a benefit in aid of The Prince&#x27;s Trust and attended by Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales, a fan of the group.

Recordings from the tour were released on the live albums &quot;The Way We Walk, Volume One: The Shorts&quot; (1992) and &quot;Genesis Archive #2: 1976–1992&quot; (2000). The Wembley shows were filmed and released on home video in 1988 entitled &quot;Invisible Touch Tour&quot;. In 2003, it was reissued on DVD and renamed &quot;Genesis Live at Wembley Stadium&quot;.

<doc id="957653" wikidata="Q5288106" url="?curid=957653" title="Does exactly what it says on the tin">
<text>&quot;It does exactly what it says on the tin&quot; was originally an advertising slogan in the United Kingdom, which then became a common idiomatic phrase in that country. It colloquially means that the name of something is an accurate description of its qualities. It is akin to the previously existing phrases &quot;by name and by nature&quot; and &quot;it lives up to its name&quot;. It originated in a series of television advertisements by the woodstain and wood-dye manufacturer Ronseal, initiated in 1994 and still being broadcast in advertisements and online media .

The slogan was created by Liz Whiston and Dave Shelton at the London advertising agency HHCL. The idea of the phrase was to emphasise that the company&#x27;s products would act and last for the amount of time exactly as described on the tin can. The word &quot;tin&quot; is generally used even when the product is sold in a different type of container, although &quot;box&quot; is also sometimes used. The expression soon entered common usage in the UK.

The phrase is also commonly known and used in Ireland. The Ronseal advertising campaign has also been shown there, and UK television is widely available in Ireland. In 2004, toothpaste manufacturer Colgate began a similar advertising campaign in Ireland stating that its product &quot;does exactly what it says on the tube&quot;.

The phrase is a registered trademark of the Sherwin-Williams Company, the owner of Ronseal, across the European Community for products including paints, varnishes, and wood preservatives (E3085826).

== Cultural references ==
In 2007, a song titled &quot;What It Says on the Tin&quot; was released by the British singer Katie Melua. Although the song is about relationships, the phrase has a similar meaning.

<text>The Army Medical Services (AMS) is the organisation responsible for administering the corps that deliver medical, veterinary, dental and nursing services in the British Army. It is headquartered at the former Staff College, Camberley, near the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

On 15 November 2024, with the exception of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, the constituent corps of the AMS amalgamated to form a new Corps, the Royal Army Medical Service. The AMS long predates any of the four constituent Corps, with the term dating back at least to the Napoleonic Wars, and the new Corps will take the precedence formerly held by the RAMC in the British Army’s order of battle.

==Role==
AMS is responsible for administering the corps that deliver medical, veterinary, dental and nursing services in the British Army. These are:
* Royal Army Medical Service
* Royal Army Veterinary Corps
AMS contributes to the conservation of fighting strength and morale of the Army and advises commanders on matters of health and disease.

The Defence Medical Services, by contrast, is an umbrella adjectival term, and should not been seen as equivalent to a command or an Army Corps as constituted under the Armed Forces Act 2006.

==Administration and leadership==
The Army Medical Services are administered by Headquarters Army Medical Directorate at Andover, previously under the leadership of the Director General Army Medical Services (DGAMS), formerly Major General Jeremy Rowan.
The Director General answered to the Adjutant-General, and his role was to promote effective medical, dental and veterinary health services for the Army and provide a policy focus for individual medical training, doctrine and force development. The post was disestablished after 2016.

A Freedom of Information request identified that from 2018, &quot;day to day responsibility for medical policy and capability development&quot; would &quot;lie at Brigadier level,&quot; but did not indicate the title of that particular post. As of March 2019, a Brigadier is employed within the senior Army ranks as Senior Health Advisor, who &quot;Monitors and assesses the health of the Army to assist Director Personnel in the provision of Health Policy, provides policy oversight and assurance for Commander Field Army in the generation and delivery of medical operational capability, and is directly responsible for the provision of primary care services to the Army and community mental health services to Defence.&quot;

<doc id="957660" wikidata="Q2630321" url="?curid=957660" title="Ian MacDonald">
<text>Ian MacCormick (known by the pseudonym Ian MacDonald; 3 October 1948 – 20 August 2003) was an English music critic, journalist and author, best known for both &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, his critical history of the Beatles which borrowed techniques from art historians, and &quot;The New Shostakovich&quot;, a study of Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich.

==Education and career==
Ian MacDonald was born in London on 3 October 1948. He studied at Dulwich College before briefly attending King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, at first to study English, then archaeology and anthropology. He dropped out after a year; while at Cambridge, he was distantly acquainted with the singer-songwriter Nick Drake.

From 1972 to 1975 he served as assistant editor at &quot;NME&quot;. MacDonald began a songwriting collaboration as a lyricist with the band Quiet Sun, which included his brother Bill MacCormick and future Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera. The collaboration resumed in the late 1970s, with MacDonald providing lyrics for the album &quot;Listen Now&quot;. Later, Brian Eno assisted MacDonald in producing &quot;Sub Rosa&quot;, an album of his songs released on Manzanera&#x27;s label.

In his 1994 &quot;Revolution in the Head: The Beatles&#x27; Records and the Sixties&quot;, MacDonald carefully anatomised each recording by the Beatles, examining the broad themes and sources of inspiration. The book contains detailed song-by-song analysis, but is often subjective and critical. Paul McCartney has stated his dissatisfaction with its accuracy. Access to the original Beatles master tapes was allowed during research. The book also includes his essay &quot;Fabled Foursome, Disappearing Decade&quot;, an analysis of the social and cultural changes of the 1960s and their after-effects. The entries about the Beatles&#x27; singles that topped the singles chart were released in a separate book in 2002. The edit featured a new, shorter introduction and featured only the essays on the songs on the Beatles&#x27; chart-topping album, &quot;1&quot;.

His &quot;The New Shostakovich&quot; (1990) attempted to put the works of the Russian composer in their political and social context, leaning heavily on Solomon Volkov&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot;. MacDonald&#x27;s insistence on creating a cinematic scenario for every major piece polarised opinion sharply. In 2006 a heavily revised and updated version undertaken by the British pianist Raymond Clarke, also incorporating some of MacDonald&#x27;s later writings, addressed some of these issues.

The success of &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot; motivated MacDonald to resume popular music writing, and he began contributing to Classic CD, &quot;Mojo&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot; music magazines. &quot;The People&#x27;s Music&quot;, an anthology of these writings, was published in July 2003 just weeks before his death. He had been working on a book entitled &quot;Birds, Beasts &amp; Fishes: A Guide to Animal Lore and Symbolism&quot;, and another about David Bowie. Neither has been published.

==Death==
On 20 August 2003, MacDonald died by suicide at his home in Wotten-under-Edge, following a lengthy period of clinical depression; he was 54.

The track &quot;Wish You Well&quot; on Phil Manzanera&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;6PM&quot; is a tribute to MacDonald.

<doc id="957663" wikidata="Q80232" url="?curid=957663" title="Cyclobutane">
<text>Cyclobutane is a cycloalkane and organic compound with the formula (CH2)4. Cyclobutane is a colourless gas and is commercially available as a liquefied gas. Derivatives of cyclobutane are called cyclobutanes. Cyclobutane itself is of no commercial or biological significance, but more complex derivatives are important in biology and biotechnology.

==Structure==
The bond angles between carbon atoms are significantly strained and as such have lower bond energies than related linear or unstrained hydrocarbons, e.g. butane or cyclohexane. As such, cyclobutane is unstable above about 500 °C.

The four carbon atoms in cyclobutane are not coplanar; instead, the ring typically adopts a folded or &quot;puckered&quot; conformation. This implies that the C-C-C angle is less than 90°. One of the carbon atoms makes a 25° angle with the plane formed by the other three carbons. In this way, some of the eclipsing interactions are reduced. The conformation is also known as a &quot;butterfly&quot;. Equivalent puckered conformations interconvert:

==Cyclobutanes in biology and biotechnology==
Despite the inherent strain, the cyclobutane motif is indeed found in nature. One example is pentacycloanammoxic acid, which is a ladderane composed of 5 fused cyclobutane units. The estimated strain in this compound is 3 times that of cyclobutane. The compound is found in bacteria performing the anammox process where it forms part of a tight and very dense membrane believed to protect the organism from toxic hydroxylamine and hydrazine involved in the production of nitrogen and water from nitrite ions and ammonia. Some related fenestranes are also found in nature.

Cyclobutane photo dimers (CPD) are formed by photochemical reactions that result in the coupling of the C=C double bonds of pyrimidines. Thymine dimers (T-T dimers) formed in between two thymines are the most abundant of the CPDs. CPDs are readily repaired by nucleotide excision repair enzymes. In most organisms, they can also be repaired by photolyases, a light-dependent family of enzymes. Xeroderma pigmentosum is a genetic disease where this damage can not be repaired, resulting in skin discolouration and tumours induced by exposure to UV light.

Carboplatin is a popular anticancer drug that is derived from cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid.

==Preparation==
Many methods exist for the preparation of cyclobutanes. Alkenes dimerize upon irradiation with UV-light. 1,4-Dihalobutanes convert to cyclobutanes upon dehalogenation with reducing metals.

Cyclobutane was first synthesized in 1907 by James Bruce and Richard Willstätter by hydrogenating cyclobutene in the presence of nickel.
