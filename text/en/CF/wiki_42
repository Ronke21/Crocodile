<text>&quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; is the fourth season premiere of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the 60th episode overall. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 24, 1992. In the episode, the children of Springfield attend Kamp Krusty, a summer camp named after Krusty the Clown. The camp is extremely unpleasant, leading to the campers rebelling against the camp director. Meanwhile, with the kids away, Homer and Marge enjoy more time together, and Homer becomes physically and emotionally healthier.

The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Mark Kirkland. A direct sequel episode, &quot;Kamp Krustier&quot;, aired as part of the series&#x27; twenty-eighth season, on March 5, 2017.

==Plot==
Bart and Lisa attend the summer camp Kamp Krusty, leaving Homer and Marge to have some time alone for the summer. The camp&#x27;s director, Mr. Black, has licensed the camp&#x27;s name from Krusty the Clown. However, the camp turns out to be a dystopia; as Lisa explains in a letter to her parents, &quot;Our nature hikes have become grim death marches. Our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a Dickensian workhouse.” The camp counselors are bullies Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney, who feed the campers Krusty-Brand Imitation Gruel while enjoying deluxe accommodations themselves; the bullies sip brandy with Mr. Black, who intones: &quot;Gentlemen, to evil!&quot; Worst of all, Krusty himself is unaware of the camp&#x27;s conditions and is currently on a vacation in London.

To appease the restless campers, Mr. Black tells the children that Krusty himself is coming to visit. However, &quot;Krusty&quot; turns out to be a poorly disguised Barney Gumble, and the ruse does not fool Bart. Bart then leads the campers in revolt, driving out Mr. Black and the bullies and changing the camp&#x27;s name to Camp Bart. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge see a breaking news report of the campers&#x27; revolt. After learning that Bart is the leader of the rebellion, Homer instantly loses the hair he grew and regains the weight he lost since the children went to camp.

The real Krusty is informed of Kamp Krusty&#x27;s conditions, and returns from London to visit the camp. He apologizes to the campers for their ordeal and his ignorance of their plight; to gain full control of the camp, Mr. Black had bribed Krusty with a &quot;dump truck full of money&quot;. To make it up to the campers, Krusty takes them for &quot;two weeks at the happiest place on Earth: Tijuana!&quot;. As &quot;South of the Border&quot; (sung by Gene Merlino) plays, a montage is shown of Krusty and the campers vacationing in Tijuana, but Krusty misses the bus home at the end of the trip.

==Production==

The idea that the children should go to a camp run by Krusty was first suggested by David M. Stern. The animators were enthusiastic about making this episode because they had all gone to summer camps as children and thought it would be a fun episode to write for. The writers also thought that &quot;it would be fun if while the kids are gone Homer and Marge find that as the kids are miserable their marriage is better than ever.&quot; The layout for Bart and Lisa&#x27;s cabin was influenced by the director, Mark Kirkland, who as a child went to a Boy Scout camp that had exposed wires and other similar faults. Kirkland was also sure that the character Mr. Black would reappear later in the series, but he never did. Al Jean commented, &quot;I guess that the hydrofoil really got Mr. Black out of the show forever.&quot;

After he saw the completed episode, James L. Brooks called the writers and suggested that the &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; script be used as a plotline for a film. However, the episode ran very short, and to make it barely fit the minimum time the &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; song had to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season, further complicating matters. As Jean told Brooks, &quot;First of all, if we make it into the movie then we don&#x27;t have a premiere, and second, if we can&#x27;t make 18 minutes out of this episode how are we supposed to make 80?&quot;

Along with the following episode, &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; was a holdover from the previous season&#x27;s production run. It was the final episode to be produced in this run and so the last animated at Klasky Csupo, before the show&#x27;s producers Gracie Films moved its domestic production to Film Roman.

==Cultural references==
Bart’s dream sequence at the beginning of the episode ends with the students destroying Springfield Elementary School to Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out,” mirroring the ending of the 1979 film &quot;Rock ‘n’ Roll High School&quot;.

Some elements of the plot are borrowed from the Allan Sherman song &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;, a song about a kid who went to camp and hated it. The song was later used in &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot;, and inspired the title of a later episode. The idea for the song sung by the children was from a 1960s TV show called &quot;Camp Runamuck&quot;, which has a theme song that is similar to the &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; song.

The scene where Lisa gives a bottle of whiskey to a man on horseback (payment for delivering a letter) is a reference to Meryl Streep&#x27;s scene from the film &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. Some aspects of the episode are references to the novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (a pig&#x27;s head on a spear, kids using primitive weapons and wearing war paint, and a burning effigy).

The scene where Kearney beats a drum to make the campers work in the sweatshop is taken from the slave galley scene in the 1959 film &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. The episode ends with the song &quot;South of the Border&quot;. According to the DVD commentary, the song is not sung by Frank Sinatra but by another artist impersonating him.

When Krusty is confronted by the reporters, he is asked &quot;if him and Princess Di are just friends.&quot; A more cryptic reference was made when he is confronted by another reporter and retorts &quot;Where were you when I sang at Farm Aid?&quot; The reference was inspired by Jackie Mason making the remark &quot;Where were you when I marched in the civil rights movement?&quot; Mason had a recurring role in series as Krusty&#x27;s father.

While the plot of the episode is similar to that of the 1991 video game spin-off from the television series called &quot;Bart Simpson&#x27;s Escape from Camp Deadly&quot;, the two are unrelated as the video game was released well before the first airing of the &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; episode.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; finished 24th in ratings for the week of September 21–27, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 13.5, equivalent to approximately 12.6 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.

Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an A, ultimately saying the episode began &quot;the Simpsons&quot;&#x27; fourth season in an amazing way.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, had mixed views about the episode. They said that it is &quot;A bit baffling to non-Americans unfamiliar with the summer camp system. But top grade stuff nonetheless. Anyone who&#x27;s worked as a counsellor in such a place can testify to this episode&#x27;s authenticity.&quot;

The episode&#x27;s reference to &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was named the 31st greatest film reference in the history of the show by &quot;Total Film&quot;&#x27;s Nathan Ditum.

<text>Belcarra is a village on the shore of Indian Arm, a side inlet of Burrard Inlet, and is part of Metro Vancouver. It lies northwest of Port Moody and immediately east of the Deep Cove area of North Vancouver, across the waters of Indian Arm. Isolated by geography on a narrow peninsula, Belcarra is accessible by a single winding paved road or by water. Before incorporation it was commonly known as Belcarra Bay.

It is largely a residential bedroom community for Vancouver and its suburbs. Belcarra is one of the few communities in this area that is not growing substantially. While the small neighbouring Village of Anmore has grown and changed, Belcarra has remained a relatively small community. This is a result of small land area, relative inaccessibility, and zoning for single family residential homes. With a population of 687 as of 2021, it has one of the lowest populations of any independent settlement in the Vancouver area. Many residents in Belcarra have private docks and boats; even houses that are not on the water are sometimes able to procure a shared dock.

== Etymology ==
William Norman Bole, a successful criminal lawyer and later a judge in New Westminster, was an immigrant from Ireland in the 19th century. As payment for his defence of the Irishman John Hall, Belcarra&#x27;s first European settler, Bole acquired the land that would become the Village of Belcarra. He named it after a village in his native Ireland.

==History==

Belcarra was a traditional camping area for the Tsleil-Waututh, the First Nations people whose territory it is in. Its beach and exposed westerly view give it a fine outlook and afternoon sun. The site was abandoned sometime between 1858 and 1864 when smallpox ravaged the Indigenous population. The remaining people moved their main permanent village across the inlet. The site at Belcarra was pre-empted early by European settlers, who were involved in a murder in 1882. In turn, the land was deeded to the defending solicitor, William Norman Bole, who named the place Belcarra. A summer cabin was subsequently built. In time, more cabins were built, and the local ferry company built a pier, park, and campsite, for vacationers. Admiralty Point was a government naval reserve, and was thus saved from development. The area is now a regional park.

Belcarra&#x27;s adjacency to several islands makes it a desired spot for boaters. Bedwell Bay and Sasamat Lake also are nearby, increasing the appeal.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Belcarra had a population of 687 living in 262 of its 289 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 643. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The linguistic makeup of the village is English as the first language of 91.2% of the population, and 8.0% first learnt other languages. 94.2% of the population can speak only English, 5.1% can speak both English and French.

In the village the population is spread out, with 17.6% under the age of 14, 11.0% from 15 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 40.4% from 45 to 64, and 6.6% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 44 years. For every 100 females there are 101.5 males.

For every 100 females age 15 and over, there are 107.3 males. There are 260 households, out of which 26.9% had children living with them, 69.2% ware married couples living together, 4.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.2% of all households are made up of individuals. The average married-couple family size was 2.7.

Christians makes up 55.1% of the population, or 22.8% Catholic, 27.2% Protestant, 0.0% Orthodox, and 5.1% other Christian. Other religions in the village include 1.5% Jewish, and 1.5% other religions. 41.2% of the population claimed to have no religious affiliation.

The median income for a household in the village was $100,995, and the median income for a family was $105,016. Males had an average income of $61,200 versus $34,840 for females. About 3.7% of the labour force was unemployed. The largest occupation categories were 23.5% employed in social science, education, government service and religion occupations, 17.3% business, finance and administration occupations, 17.3% sales and service occupations, and 16.0% in management occupations.

&quot;Note: Percentages may not total 100 percent due to rounding of data samples.&quot;

==Emergency services==

Belcarra contracts out its police service to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, with the main police station at Coquitlam Town Centre. Since 1978, Belcarra has had its own volunteer fire service, known as the Sasamat Fire Department, with two main halls and five fire apparatuses shared between it and the neighbouring community of Anmore. Belcarra&#x27;s ambulance service is run by the British Columbia Ambulance Service.

In addition, Coquitlam Search and Rescue is responsible for urban and wilderness search and rescue for the area between Indian Arm and Pitt Lake, and encompasses the local communities of Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, Belcarra and Anmore.

==Transportation==
As part of Metro Vancouver, Belcarra is served by the TransLink public transit system, and is on bus route 182.

== Twinning ==

Belcarra in June 2007 was twinned with its namesake, Belcarra, County Mayo, Ireland.

<doc id="952466" wikidata="Q10266" url="?curid=952466" title="Raksha Bandhan">
<text>Raksha Bandhan is a popular and traditionally Hindu annual rite or ceremony that is central to a festival of the same name celebrated in South Asia. It is also celebrated in other parts of the world significantly influenced by Hindu culture. On this day, sisters of all ages tie a talisman or amulet called the &quot;rakhi&quot; around the wrists of their brothers. The sisters symbolically protect the brothers, receive a gift in return, and traditionally invest the brothers with a share of the responsibility of their potential care.

Raksha Bandhan is observed on the last day of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana, which typically falls in August. The expression &quot;Raksha Bandhan&quot; (Sanskrit, literally &quot;the bond of protection, obligation, or care&quot;) is now principally applied to this ritual. Until the mid-20th century, the expression was more commonly applied to a similar ritual, held on the same day, with precedence in ancient Hindu texts. In that ritual, a domestic priest ties amulets, charms, or threads on the wrists of his patrons, or changes their sacred thread, and receives gifts of money. This is still the case in some places. By contrast, the sister-brother festival, with origins in folk culture, had names which varied with location. Some were rendered as &quot;saluno&quot;, &quot;silono&quot;, and &quot;rakri&quot;. A ritual associated with &quot;saluno&quot; included the sisters placing shoots of barley behind the ears of their brothers.

Of special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village exogamy. The bride marries out of her natal village or town, and her parents by custom do not visit her in her married home. In rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents&#x27; homes every year for the ceremony. Their brothers, who typically live with their parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters&#x27; married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony. The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters&#x27; married and parental homes, as well as potential stewards of their security.

In urban India, where families are increasingly nuclear, the festival has become more symbolic but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with this festival have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration. Other factors that have played a role are: the movies, social interaction, and promotion by politicized Hinduism, as well as by the nation state. Among females and males who are not blood relatives, the act of tying the &quot;rakhi&quot; amulets has given rise to the tradition of voluntary kin relations, which has sometimes cut across lines of caste, class, and religion. Authority figures have been included in such a ceremony.

==Etymology, meaning, and usage== 
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, Third Edition, 2008, the Hindi word, rākhī derives from the Sanskrit rakṣikā, a join: rakṣā protection, amulet ( &lt; rakṣ- to protect + -ikā, diminutive suffix.)

==Traditional regions of observance==
Scholars who have written about the ritual have usually described the traditional region of its observance as north India; however, also included are central India, western India and Nepal, as well as other regions of India and overseas Hindu communities such as Fiji. It is essentially a Hindu festival; however, in addition to India and Nepal, Pakistan and Mauritius are two other countries where Hindus celebrate this occasion. Anthropologist Jack Goody, whose field study was conducted in Nandol, in Gujarat, describes Rakshabandhan as an &quot;annual ceremony ... of northern and western India&quot;. Anthropologist Michael Jackson writes, &quot;While traditional North Indian families do not have a Father&#x27;s or Mother&#x27;s Day, or even the equivalent of Valentine&#x27;s Day, there is a Sister&#x27;s Day, called Raksha Bandhan, ...&quot; Religious scholar J. Gordon Melton describes it as &quot;primarily a North Indian festival&quot;. Leona M. Anderson and Pamela D. Young describe it as &quot;one of the most popular festivals of North India&quot;. Anthropologist David G. Mandelbaum has described it as &quot;an annual rite observed in northern and western India&quot;. Other descriptions of primary regions are of development economist Bina Agarwal (&quot;In Northern India and Nepal this is ritualized in festivals such as raksha-bandhan.&quot;), scholar and activist Ruth Vanita (&quot;a festival widely celebrated in north India.&quot;), anthropologist James D. Faubion (&quot;In north India this brother-sister relationship is formalized in the ceremony of &#x27;Rakshabandhan.&#x27;&quot;), and social scientist Prem Chowdhry (&quot;... in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in North India&quot;.).

==Evolution of Raksha Bandhan==
Sociologist Yogendra Singh has noted the contribution of American anthropologist McKim Marriott to an understanding of the origins of the &quot;Raksha Bandhan&quot; festival. In rural society, according to Marriott, there is steady interplay between two cultural traditions, the elite or &quot;great&quot; tradition based in texts, such as the Vedas in Indian society, and the local or &quot;little&quot;, based in folk art and literature. According to Singh, Marriott has shown that the &quot;Raksha Bandhan&quot; festival has its &quot;origin in the &#x27;little tradition&#x27;&quot;. Anthropologist Onkar Prasad has further suggested that Marriott was the first to consider the limitations within which each village tradition &quot;operates to retain its essence&quot;.

In his village study, Marriott described two concurrently observed traditions on the full moon day of Shravana: a &quot;little tradition&quot; festival called &quot;Saluno&quot;, and a &quot;great tradition&quot; festival, &quot;Raksha Bandhan&quot;, but which Marriott calls, &quot;Charm Tying&quot;: On Saluno day, many husbands arrive at their wives&#x27; villages, ready to carry them off again to their villages of marriage. But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers. (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the Bhavisyottara Purana, ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held. The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel &quot;plums.&quot; Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.

Norwegian anthropologist Øyvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern Uttar Pradesh in the 1990s, noted that the &quot;great tradition&quot; festival was in retreat and the &quot;little tradition&quot; one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.

==Precedence in Hindu texts==
Important in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot;, in which the Hindu god Krishna describes to Yudhishthira the ritual of having a &quot;raksha&quot; (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the rajpurohit) on the &quot;purnima&quot; (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana. In the crucial passage, Krishna says, &quot;&quot;Parth&quot; (applied to any of the three sons of Kunti (also, Pritha), here with a particular empasis on Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month&#x27;s full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a Brahmin should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the &quot;shradh&quot; ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a Shudra should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the &quot;mantras&quot;. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the &quot;purohit&quot; should bind this packet on the king&#x27;s wrist with the words,&#x27;I am binding &quot;raksha&quot; (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound &quot;Mahabali&quot; King of the Asuras. Always stay firm in resolve.&#x27; In 
the same manner as the king, after offering prayers to the Brahmins, the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras should conclude their Raksha Bandhan ceremony.&quot;

==Relation to territorial exogamy==
Of special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village exogamy—in which a bride marries out of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home. Anthropologist Leo Coleman writes: Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the &quot;traditional&quot; form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse—at a crisis, or during childbearing—to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband&#x27;s home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister&#x27;s marriage.

In rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents&#x27; homes every year for the ceremony. Scholar Linda Hess writes: Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters&#x27; married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony. Folklorist Susan Snow Wadley writes: &quot;In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan. The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters&#x27; married- and parental homes, as well as potential stewards of their security.

==Urbanization and mid-20th century transformations==
In his 1955 village study, anthropologist McKim Marriott noted transformations of ritual that had begun to take place: A further, secondary transformation of the festival of Charm Tying is also beginning to be evident in Kishan Garhi, for the thread charms of the priests are now factory-made in more attractive form ... A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers&#x27; wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.

In urban India, where families are increasingly nuclear and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with these rites, however, have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration, According to anthropologist, Leo Coleman: In modern rakhi, technologically mediated and performed with manufactured charms, migrating men are the medium by which the village women interact, vertically, with the cosmopolitan center—the site of radio broadcasts, and the source of technological goods and national solidarity.

Hindi movies have played a salient role. According to author Vaijayanti Pandit, Raksha Bandhan traditionally celebrated in North India has acquired greater importance due to Hindi films. Lightweight and decorative rakhis, which are easy to post, are needed in large quantities by the market to cater to brothers and sisters living in different parts of the country or abroad. More social interaction among India&#x27;s population has played a role in the increased celebration of this festival. According to author Renuka Khandekar: But since independence and the gradual opening up of Indian society, Raksha Bandhan as celebrated in North India has won the affection of many South Indian families. For this festival has the peculiar charm of renewing sibling bonds.

The festival has also been promoted by Hindu political organizations. According to authors P. M. Joshy and K. M. Seethi, The RSS employs a cultural strategy to mobilise people through festivals. It observes six major festivals in a year. ... Till 20 years back, festivals like &#x27;Raksha Bandhan&#x27; were unknown to South Indians. Through &quot;shakha&quot;″s intense campaign, now they have become popular in the southern India. In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi&#x27;—the thread that is used in the &#x27;Raksha Bandhan&#x27;—has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres. Similarly, according to author Christophe Jaffrelot, This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood) Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival. as Leo Coleman states: ... as citizens become participants in the wider &quot;new traditions&quot; of the national state. Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.

More recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance. According to author Prem Chowdhry, Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this Act through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.

==Voluntary kin relations==

Among women and men who are not blood relatives, there is also a transformed tradition of voluntary kin relations, achieved through the tying of &quot;rakhi&quot; amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines, and Hindu and Muslim divisions. In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction. According to author Prem Chowdhry, &quot;The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation. The ritual thread is offered, though not tied and higher caste men customarily give some money in return.&quot;

==Regional variations in ritual==

While Raksha Bandhan is celebrated in various parts of India, different regions mark the day in different ways.

In the state of West Bengal, this day is also called Jhulan Purnima. Prayers and puja of Krishna and Radha are performed there. Sisters tie rakhi to brothers and wish immortality. Political parties, offices, friends, and educational institutions celebrate this day with a new hope for a good relationship.

In Maharashtra, among the Koli community, the festival of Raksha Bandhan / Rakhi Pournima is celebrated along with &quot;Narali Pournima&quot; (coconut day festival). Kolis are the fishermen community of the coastal state. The fishermen offer prayers to Varuna, the Hindu god of the sea, to invoke his blessings, and throw coconuts into the sea as offerings to him. The girls and women tie &quot;rakhi&quot; on their brother&#x27;s wrist, as elsewhere.

In many regions of North India, it is a common practice to fly kites on the nearby occasions of Janamashtami and Raksha Bandhan. The locals buy kilometres of strong kite string, commonly called &quot;gattu door&quot; in the local language, along with a multitude of kites.
In Nepal, Raksha Bandhan is referred to as Janai Purnima or Rishitarpani, and involves a sacred thread ceremony. It is observed by both Hindus and Buddhists of Nepal. The Hindu men change the thread they wear around their chests (&quot;janai&quot;), while in some parts of Nepal girls and women tie &quot;rakhi&quot; on their brother&#x27;s wrists. The Raksha Bandhan-like brother sister festival is observed by other Hindus of Nepal during one of the days of the Tihar (or Diwali) festival.

The festival is observed by the Shaiva Hindus, and is popularly known in Newar community as &quot;Gunhu Punhi&quot;.

In Odisha, Raksha Bandhan is also called Rakhi Purnima / Gamha Purnima. A sister ties rakhi around her brother&#x27;s wrist as a mark of love and honour and the brother promises to protect his sister from all the difficulties. The name &quot;Gamha Purnima&quot; refers to the celebration on the same day of the birthday of Lord Balabhadra, considered the god of farming; farmers in Odisha tie rakhis to cattle on this day.

==Depictions in movies and popular history==
The religious myths claimed as the basis of &quot;Raksha Bandhan&quot; are disputed, and some historians consider the historical stories associated with it to be apocryphal.

===&quot;Jai Santoshi Maa&quot; (1975 film)===
The 1975 film &quot;Jai Santoshi Maa&quot; tells a story in which Ganesha had two sons, Shubha and Labha. The two boys became frustrated that they had no sister to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with. They asked their father Ganesha for a sister, but to no avail. Finally, the sage Narada appeared, who persuaded Ganesha that a daughter would enrich him as well as his sons. Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named Santoshi Maa by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh&#x27;s wives, &quot;Riddhi&quot; (Amazing) and &quot;Siddhi&quot; (Perfection). Thereafter, Shubha Labha (literally &quot;Holy Profit&quot;) had a sister named Santoshi Maa (literally &quot;Goddess of Satisfaction&quot;), to tie rakhi on Raksha Bandhan. 

According to author Lawrence Cohen: [I]n Varanasi the paired figures were usually called Ṛddhi and Siddhi, Gaṇeśa&#x27;s relationship to them was often vague. He was their &quot;mālik&quot;, their owner; they were more often &quot;dasīs&quot; than &quot;patnīs&quot; (wives). Yet Gaṇeśa was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film &quot;Jai Santoshī Mā&quot;. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Gaṇeśa has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshī Mā. In the film, the role of Gaṇeśa as family man is developed significantly. Santoshī Mā&#x27;s genesis occurs on Rāksa bandan. Gaṇeśa&#x27;s sister is visiting for the tying of the &quot;rākhī&quot;. He calls her &quot;bahenmansa&quot;—his &quot;mind-born&quot; sister. Gaṇeśa&#x27;s wives, Ṛddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Śubha and Lābha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the &quot;rākhī&quot;. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Ṛddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshī Mā.

===&quot;Sikandar&quot; (1941 film)===
Film historian Anja Wieber describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie &quot;Sikandar&quot;:

In &quot;Sikandar&quot; a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25–0:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers&#x27; arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius&#x27;s (a.k.a. Dara&#x27;s) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32–35). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children&#x27;s book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.

===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===

Another controversial historical account is that of Rani Karnavati of Chittor and Mughal Emperor Humayun, which dates to 1535 CE. When Rani Karnavati, the widowed queen of the king of Chittor, realised that she could not defend against the invasion by the Sultan of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah, she sent a rakhi to Emperor Humayun. The Emperor, according to one version of the story, set off with his troops to defend Chittor. He arrived too late, and Bahadur Shah had already captured the Rani&#x27;s fortress. Alternative accounts from the period, including those by historians in Humayun&#x27;s Mughal court, do not mention the rakhi episode and some historians have expressed skepticism whether it ever happened. Historian Satish Chandra wrote, ... According to a mid-seventeenth century Rajasthani account, Rani Karnavati, the Rana&#x27;s mother, sent a bracelet as rakhi to Humayun, who gallantly responded and helped. Since none of the contemporary sources mention this, little credit can be given to this story ... Humayun&#x27;s own memoirs never mention this, and give different reasons for his war with Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat in 1535.

<text>The Jump River is a small rocky river in north-central Wisconsin. In the late 19th century it was used to drive logs down to the Chippewa River. Today it is recreational, rambling through woods and farmlands, used mostly by fishermen and paddlers.

==Geography==
The Jump is formed at the confluence of the North Fork Jump River and the South Fork Jump River in southwestern Price County, Wisconsin. From there it flows approximately 25 miles (40 km) through Rusk, Taylor and Chippewa counties, emptying into the Holcombe Flowage and joining the Chippewa River, and eventually the Mississippi.

Communities along the river are Sheldon, Jump River, and Prentice.

==History==
The origin of the river&#x27;s name is the source of minor local controversy. Some say that the name comes from the jumping water in the many rapids which mark nearly the upper half of its course. Others maintain that the river was so-named because a 19th-century forest fire jumped the river. Still others suggest that log drivers named it for the way the water level &quot;jumps&quot; up and down rapidly after rains and thaws. Its name in Ojibwe does not shed light on its present name either, since the Ojibwa call this stream &quot;Manidoons-ziibi&quot; (&quot;Little Spirit River&quot;).

Indians lived along the Jump in the early years, growing little plots of crops on the river bottoms.

Jump River Falls (Big Falls) was once thought the likely rapids where Father René Menard disappeared in 1661 while trying to reach a band of refugee Hurons near Lake Chelsea. Current thought is that he more likely disappeared at the dells of the Big Rib River, in the southeast corner of Taylor county.

Logging on the Jump had begun by 1858. Before that the Jump River valley was covered by heavy forest. The first surveyors in the mid-19th century found hemlock, yellow birch, sugar maple, white pine, black spruce, tamarack, white cedar, and other species, with hemlock most common. Crews cut the white pine first and stored the logs through the winter, then drove them down the river to mills at Chippewa and Eau Claire. Logs were driven from April to July. For the winter of 1888 to 1889, the Chippewa Logging Company and Mississippi River Logging Company estimated the cuts on various branches to be:

The last logs were driven down the Jump around 1903. The less buoyant species have been logged ever since, hauled out by rail and truck.

The first bridge across the Jump was the Wisconsin Central Railway&#x27;s trestle at Prentice, built in the 1870s. The &quot;Black Bridge&quot; above the village of Jump River&#x27;s swimming hole was built in 1899 and 1900. The SM&amp;P Railway bridge at Jump River was built in 1904. The Range Line wagon bridge in Jump River was built in 1909. It was wrecked by an ice jam in 1913 and repaired. The Albert bridge on what is now county H was built in 1912. The La Follette Bridge just east of Jump River opened in 1933. The worst flood on record occurred around Labor Day of 1941. Days of rain raised the river level about twelve feet, destroying the Black Bridge and La Follette Bridge and washing out the north approach to the Range Line Bridge.

==Recreation==
The Jump is good for canoeing when the water is high enough, with little rapids and boulders to dodge. The banks are largely undeveloped, though roads and farms are often just behind the trees. When the water level is medium to high, the stretch from the village of Jump River to County H or to Sheldon is fun. When the level is higher one can canoe from below Big Falls down to the village, and even above the Falls. Recent water levels at the gauging station at Sheldon are available here.

Fisherman angle in many holes along the river. Fish in the river include northern pike, smallmouth bass, musky, walleye, catfish, redhorse, and suckers. The areas below the North and South Forks are one of twelve areas in Wisconsin where lake sturgeon may be legally harvested.
Big Falls County Park, known locally as &quot;Jump River Falls,&quot; surrounds a small gorge where the river tumbles through boulders. It has a picnic area and walking trails along the river. Picnic areas are also at parks in the village of Jump River and Haley Park in Sheldon. Haley Park has a sandy swimming beach, as does &quot;the swimming hole,&quot; a mile above the village of Jump River.

In winter when the river is frozen, snowmobiles run along it on the ice.

<text>Egil &quot;Bud&quot; Krogh Jr. (; August 3, 1939 – January 18, 2020) was an American lawyer who became infamous as an official of the Nixon administration and who was imprisoned for his part in the Watergate scandal. He was a Senior Fellow on Ethics and Leadership at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress and Counselor to the Director at the School for Ethics and Global Leadership.

Krogh co-authored the book &quot;Integrity: Good People, Bad Choices, and Life Lessons from the White House&quot; with his son Matthew. The book is the basis for the HBO series &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;.

==Early life==
Krogh was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Josephine (Woolling) and Egil Einar Krogh, a Norwegian immigrant and a businessman. His mother was a homemaker while his father was an executive with the Marshall Field&#x27;s chain of department stores. His father&#x27;s frequent relocation had the family living in Chicago, Portland, Oregon, St. Louis, and eventually Seattle.

==Education==
Krogh graduated with the highest honors from Principia College in Elsah, Illinois in 1961. After service in the U.S. Navy as a communications officer aboard USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; (1962–1965), he received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Washington School of Law in 1968.

==Career==
Krogh was employed by Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts, and Hodge, the Seattle law firm of family friend John Ehrlichman, and joined Ehrlichman in the counsel&#x27;s office of Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign. After Nixon was elected, Krogh helped with the arrangements for the inauguration. He joined the Nixon White House as an advisor on the District of Columbia and later served as liaison to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. It was there that he met G. Gordon Liddy.

===Special Investigation Unit===
Ehrlichman made Krogh head of the &quot;Special Investigation Unit&quot; in the White House, charged with investigating information given covertly to the press by administration staffers. Krogh and his associates were known familiarly as the &quot;Plumbers&quot; — a secret team of operatives charged with fixing &quot;leaks.&quot; It was an unlikely choice: Krogh had a reputation as someone who obeyed the law so scrupulously that his friends gave him the ironic nickname &quot;Evil Krogh.&quot; Journalist Theodore White would write, &quot;to put Egil Krogh in charge of a secret police operation was equivalent to making Frank Merriwell chief executive of a KGB squad.&quot; Krogh brought Liddy into his new office.

When the administration decided to pursue the Pentagon Papers leakers, it was Krogh who approved the September 1971 burglary of the office of Lewis Fielding, the psychiatrist seeing Daniel Ellsberg. Liddy and E. Howard Hunt would commit the actual break-in. Ironically, Ehrlichman, who himself went to prison for Watergate-related crimes, would later write in his memoirs that this was an example of &quot;such doubtful personal judgment ... that it has to be said [Krogh] materially contributed to the demise of the Nixon administration.&quot;

Krogh&#x27;s employment with the SIU was terminated when he subsequently refused to authorize a wiretap. That reticence presaged his acceptance of responsibility for the part he played in the lawlessness of the Nixon White House. When the Watergate scandal broke, and Krogh was implicated, he approached the prosecutors without any request for leniency. On November 30, 1973, Krogh pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to violate Fielding&#x27;s civil rights and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. He was sentenced to six years in prison, though he served only four-and-a-half months. After his release from prison he wrote, &quot;In a country like America, where the rule of law is supposed to be paramount, we have to be able to believe in the integrity of our public officials, civil servants...without a commitment to living and acting with integrity, we can only expect more of the same problems, with good people placed in circumstances where bad decisions become all but unavoidable.&quot;

Krogh was disbarred by the Washington State Supreme Court in 1975.

In 1977, he petitioned to be readmitted to the practice of law, based on his recognition and acceptance of his wrongdoing. This petition was rejected. Finally, in 1980, his petition was granted and he was reinstated to the practice of law.

===Elvis Presley===
During his time in the White House, Krogh was in charge of the impromptu visit of Elvis Presley on December 21, 1970. Presley had arrived at the gate with a letter for President Nixon requesting a personal meeting to discuss how he could help the government fight the drug trade. Because of Krogh&#x27;s work regarding illegal drugs, he managed the visit. The meeting took place and Nixon gave Presley an actual narcotics agent badge. Krogh wrote a book about these events: &quot;The Day Elvis Met Nixon&quot;. Presley&#x27;s visit was also the subject of the 2016 film &quot;Elvis &amp; Nixon&quot;, in which Krogh was portrayed by Colin Hanks.

===Private sector===
In 1980, after being readmitted to the practice of law, Krogh became a partner at Krogh &amp; Leonard in Seattle and provided legal, consulting, and mediation services to energy and other clients.

In 2007, Krogh and his son Matthew wrote the book &quot;Integrity: Good People, Bad Choices, and Life Lessons from the White House.&quot; The HBO limited series &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;, starring Woody Harrelson and Justin Theroux, is partly based on &quot;Integrity&quot;. He was a frequent lecturer on the topic of legal ethics, having visited many schools, bar associations and other gatherings of lawyers and judges. As of 2014, he was a speaker at events where he talked about his experiences.
===Personal===
Krogh&#x27;s marriages to Suzanne Lowell, Laura Lee Carkener, and Ann Horton all ended in divorce. Survivors include his partner, Nancy Glenn Hansen of Washington; two sons from his first marriage, Peter, of Nevada City, California, and Matthew, of Bellingham, Washington; a stepdaughter from his second, Laura Dail, of Manhattan, New York; a son from his third, James, of Shelton, Washington; two sisters; and five grandchildren.

==Death==
Krogh died from heart failure in Washington, D.C., on January 18, 2020, at age 80.

<text>The cobalt blue tarantula or Cyriopagopus lividus is a species of tarantula which is in the family Theraphosidae which is native to Myanmar and over the border into Thailand. It was originally described as Haplopelma lividum.

==Description==
The cobalt blue tarantula is a medium-sized tarantula with a leg span around . It is noted for its iridescent blue legs and light gray prosoma and opisthosoma, the latter of which may contain darker gray chevrons. Males and females look the same until the ultimate (final) molt of the males. At this point, the male exhibits sexual dimorphism in the form of a light tan or bronze coloration and legginess. Additionally, males gain a palpal bulb on the pedipalps and tibial apophyses (mating hooks). The female eventually becomes larger than the male and lives years longer. The cobalt blue tarantula is a fossorial species and spends nearly all of its time in deep burrows of its own construction. The venom of the tarantula is not enough to kill a human, but it can badly sting them and be extremely painful. The venom contains glutamic acid, at 0.97% concentration. Histamine and adenosine were detected at 0.14% and 0.10% with the polyamine spermine noted in trace amounts at 0.002% (Moore et al., 2009).

==Habitat==
Cobalt blue tarantulas inhabit the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where they construct deep burrows, and generally only leave them to find food.

==Pets==
The cobalt blue tarantula is a mainstay in the pet trade, despite being a fast and defensive tarantula with potent venom. Bites from this species can result in severe muscle cramps and inflammation.

<text>A country estate of 438 acres, the heart of Heckfield Place is a Georgian Grade II listed manor house, located in Hampshire, United Kingdom. It was built between 1763 and 1766 for Jane Hawley (1744–1815), it was enlarged by the Shaw Lefevre family who lived in the estate from 1786 to 1895. In the 20th century, it was owned by the family of Col Horace Walpole before being sold to Racal Electronics plc. and converted to a conference and training centre in 1981–1982.

An additional wing was added to the north of the manor house, extending into the walled garden. From 2000 to 2002, Heckfield Place was run as a corporate training centre by the Thales Group. The building underwent major refurbishment from 2009 until 2018, when it opened as a luxury country house hotel and awarded The Sunday Times’ Hotel of the Year Award in 2018.

== Original house and Jane Hawley ==

Jane Hawley (1744–1815), the elder daughter of Revd John Baker of Ilton, Somerset (1713–1757), began the construction of the five-bay core of Heckfield Place manor house after the death of her husband, William Hawley of West Green House, Mattingley around August 1763. Jane had been orphaned (1757) and married (still a minor, in 1760), became a mother (1761) and then a widow (1763) all in around six years, and she was still not yet twenty years old.

She borrowed against the funds left in trust for her infant son Henry, and used some of the money to build herself a new house and amass a small estate. The choice of the site for Heckfield Place appears to have been influenced by the proximity of her uncle and guardian, William Baker (1716–1800) and aunt Sarah with whom lived Jane&#x27;s younger sister Catherine, at a house called The Grove (part of the Stratfield Saye estate of George Pitt), on Heckfield Heath. The site was also high, pleasant, and healthy, and afforded magnificent views to the north-east towards Windsor.

The architect of the house is not known. It was brick-built, three-storey (with a stone staircase), of five bays, with five rooms on the ground floor. To make the most of the views down a small valley, the garden front faced east, and the main entrance was on the west front. Late 18th-century maps suggest three outbuildings to the north and north-west. These included &#x27;a double coach-house, and good stabling for ten horses.&#x27; Advertisements for the letting of West Green, in July 1766 suggest that Heckfield Place was completed by this date.

In 1768 Jane married for a second time. Her husband was Revd. Mountague Rush (1731–1785), younger son of Sir John Rush of Streatley, a former High Sheriff of Berkshire. Jane had another nine (eight surviving) children. Rush was, from 1774, the rector of the neighbouring parish of Elvetham. Revd Rush died in February 1785, an event which triggered the sale of Heckfield Place. Contemporary sale notices confirm that the Heckfield Place estate, by this date, stretched to about 120 acres.

== The Shaw Lefevres ==

John Lefevre (1721/2-1790) of a successful Huguenot family of textile dyers, gin distillers and bankers established around Spitalfields and Stratford, East London, bought Heckfield Place in February 1786. He and his wife Helena (née Selman, d 1816) had an only daughter, also Helena, who in 1789 was married to Charles Shaw (1759–1823). John Lefevre died early the following year. Shaw, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, was of Yorkshire origin, his father, George Shaw, having been the rector of Kirk Smeaton. As a condition of marriage (and inheritance) Charles added the name &#x27;Lefevre&#x27; to his own.

Charles Shaw Lefevre became MP for Newtown (Isle of Wight, 1796–1802) and for Reading (1802–1820), was the Recorder for Basingstoke, and in the 1790s, raised a company of militia in North Hampshire. After the death of John Lefevre&#x27;s widow in 1816, the Shaw Lefevres enlarged the Rush house by the addition of identical wings to the north and south. Servants&#x27; quarters, walled gardens, an ice house, stables and coach houses were also built, and the upper lake created. The Grove (possibly used as their home while the works were on-going) appears to have been demolished by 1818.

By 1790, Shaw Lefevre had also acquired the present-day Home Farm acreage. Through land exchanges with neighbours (particularly Pitt and afterwards, the Dukes of Wellington), by purchase and through enclosure, Shaw Lefevre and his son greatly enlarged the estate, particularly to the south, until it extended to 2,388 acres.

The Shaw Lefevres had four (three surviving) sons: Charles (later Viscount Eversley 1794–1888), John (1797–1879, Clerk of the Parliaments) and Henry (1802–1880, banker). Charles married in 1817 Emma Laura Whitbread (1798–1857) youngest daughter of the leading Whig politician Samuel Whitbread II. They had six children, three daughters who survived to adulthood, and three sons, all of whom died. Charles Shaw Lefevre senior suffered badly with gout, and died in 1823. His widow, Helena, died in France in 1834.

The younger Charles Shaw Lefevre inherited from his father and entered Parliament as the (Whig) Member for Downton, Isle of Wight, in 1830. After the Reform of Parliament, he became the MP for North Hampshire to which he was returned unopposed from 1832 until his retirement in 1857. He showed an interest mainly in agricultural affairs, particularly the heated topic of corn prices, and he chaired a Commission on Agricultural Depression 1835–36.

Charles and Emma Shaw Lefevre undertook two further phases of work to the manor house: by 1840 square bay windows had been added to the east and west fronts, and outside, a formal Italianate balustraded terrace had been wrapped around the east and south fronts; by the 1850s, the whole of the south-east corner of the house had been thrown out to create a fine library (a scheme that possibly involved Edward Blore, whose diaries record visits to Heckfield Place in December and January 1846–47). Probably at the same time, French windows were inserted into the south front, giving direct access to the garden from the drawing room. Sicilian marble columns and fireplaces were added in the public rooms, the cast-iron firebacks displaying the quartered arms of Shaw Lefevre and Whitbread.

At the north end of the terrace, a conservatory was added, perpendicular to the house. Inserted into the terrace on the east side were steps giving access to the Pinetum and shrubberies, begun in the mid-1850s. A second lake was excavated below the first, with a waterfall, island and boat house.

In May 1839 Shaw Lefevre was elected Speaker of the House of Commons under the Whig government of Lord Melbourne. After the dissolution of Parliament in 1841, he retained the post – the first Speaker to do so after a change of governing party. Sir Robert Peel (with Shaw Lefevre, a co-founder of the Agricultural Society of England in 1838) assured Shaw Lefevre that &#x27;my own vote will be given with great satisfaction in favour of your Re-election as Speaker.&#x27; This is how Shaw Lefevre was able to &#x27;establish a powerful tradition of political neutrality for its future presiding officers to follow.&#x27;

As a director of Whitbread, it was also Shaw Lefevre who first used the dray horses of the firm&#x27;s City brewery to draw the Speaker&#x27;s Coach to State Openings of Parliament, a tradition maintained until Whitbread closed the Chiswell Street premises in 1976. He retained the post until he felt that his hearing was deteriorating, and retired in May 1857. Shaw Lefevre is the second-longest Speaker in the history of the Commons. Palmerston believed Shaw Lefevre to be &#x27;the best who ever filled the chair.&#x27;

Having no male heir, Shaw Lefevre negotiated a life peerage as Viscount Eversley and a pension of £4,000 per annum. Just as he was on the point of retirement, Shaw Lefevre was widowed; he survived his wife by thirty years. Two of their daughters married into the Mildmay family, Helena living at the nearby Dogmersfield estate; their eldest daughter, Emma Laura, did not marry and was chatelaine of Heckfield Place in her father&#x27;s retirement.

During these decades, Lord Eversley&#x27;s chief pleasures were his gardens and his game. Lord Eversley&#x27;s Head Gardener from 1865 was William Wildsmith (1837–1890). Wildsmith became one of the foremost men of his profession, leading the contemporary development of carpet bedding (for which the terrace at Heckfield Place was famous) from over-fussy floral patterns of annuals into looser, hardy, year-round planting. Wildsmith sat on fruit committees at Kew Gardens, wrote columns for contemporary journals and contributed a chapter on summer bedding to William Robinson&#x27;s &quot;English Flower Garden&quot;. He also won for Heckfield Place a reputation as a top training ground for outstanding gardeners.

At Heckfield Place, Wildsmith extended sub-tropical planting around the lower lake; the pinetum flourished in the native heathland soil, and included early sequoiadendron specimens; fifteen men tended the shrubberies; glass frames of every description enabled the unseasonal forcing of produce, for example of strawberries for the table in February; the walled gardens were legendary for fruit – for pears (the favourite fruit of Lord Eversley) and for grapes in particular. The grape room could preserve up to 2,000 bunches, enabling dessert grapes to be offered on the dining table every day of the year. The Heckfield Place garden was opened to the public, and in 1882 drew 2,000 visitors in five days. The &quot;Journal of Horticulture and Cottage Gardener&quot; that year described it as &#x27;a model garden both in design and execution. Surpassed by none and equalled by few.&#x27;

Lord Eversley bought himself a new shotgun for his ninetieth birthday and the woods were developed to supply fine driven shooting. Under Head Keeper Mr Martin, on a single day in 1887, five guns between them bagged 580 pheasant, 4 partridge, 16 hares and 24 rabbits. Eversley&#x27;s interest in agriculture was undiminished. He served as president of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1862 (the year after Prince Albert, who had died in office). A model home farm, today&#x27;s Home Farm, was built at Heckfield Place, with a state-of-the-art dairy to supply the manor house. Lord Eversley invested in subsoil draining on estate farms and enjoyed livestock breeding. His Smithfield Show entry of 1851, an &#x27;improved Heckfield Pig&#x27; was described simply as &#x27;astonishing&#x27;.

Heckfield Place remained a focus for the wider Shaw Lefevre family until Lord Eversley died, aged 94, on 28 December 1888. His daughter remained at Heckfield Place for a few years, but the Trustees put the estate up for sale in 1895.

== The Walpole family ==
Colonel Horace Walpole (1849–1919) bought the Heckfield Place estate by private treaty in July 1895. Walpole was a four-times great-nephew of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, but the illegitimate son of the 4th Earl of Orford as a result of his affair with Lady Susan Hamilton. As such, Col Walpole was barred from inheriting the title, but on his father&#x27;s death, in December 1894, he inherited considerable wealth and personal effects, enabling him to buy Heckfield Place. Improvements were made by Col Walpole to the house, including the installation of electricity, redigging the drains, and the building of a brick tower near the walled gardens, to distribute water pumped from a nearby spring, to the house, cottages and gardens.

Walpole and his wife Pauline (née Langdale, 1858–1944) had two daughters, Dorothy and Maude. Until the outbreak of war in 1914, life at Heckfield Place continued much as it had, the seasons punctuated by open gardens, shooting days, horse-racing and fox-hunting. The Walpoles were a Catholic family, and the contents of Heckfield Place included an extraordinary collection of Stuart portraits. Lord Eversley&#x27;s erstwhile conservatory was converted to a chapel, with a priest from Douai Abbey leading mass on Sundays, alternately with neighbouring Bramshill House.

When Walpole died in 1919 he left the house to his eldest daughter Dorothy (1895–1977). The same year she married Major Austin Scott Murray (1881–1943); they had one daughter, Anne. Dorothy Scott Murray steered Heckfield Place through the difficult years of the twentieth century. She sold a large proportion of the estate (including, in 1920 about 1300 acres around Mattingley) and many family artefacts.

Major Scott Murray died in 1943 and two years later Dorothy married Colonel Colin Kayser Davy (1896–1971). In the 1950s and 1960s Dorothy Davy sold off Walpole family pictures, books, manuscripts, miniatures, and silver. The management of the gardens was simplified, it being written of Dorothy that &#x27;If you want to find the lady of the manor in winter she will be in some bush with a billhook; in summer pursuing her little motor mower along the paths. You&#x27;ll find her with no difficulty, for as soon as you get anywhere near the dogs will come rushing and bawling blue murder.&#x27; Dorothy lived at Heckfield Place until her death in 1977 after which the estate passed to her daughter&#x27;s family and was sold.

== Conference and training centre ==
Heckfield Place and sixty-seven acres were bought by Patrick Hungerford and Toby Ward in 1981 and converted to a training and conference facility, acquired by Racal Electronics the following year.

Racal&#x27;s customers, particularly military radio users, attended training at Heckfield Place through the 1980s, resulting in an eclectic mix of international guests.

In the mid-1980s, Racal began the move into cellular radio, launching Vodafone in January 1985 after selling off much of Racal to Thales (formerly Thomson CSF).

Heckfield Place now became essentially a Vodafone staff training centre. Racal sold Vodafone in 1991 and in late 2000 Racal itself was bought for £1,300m by Thales. The house was run as Thales Commercial University until its sale to the current owner in 2002.

== Heckfield Place as it is today ==
From 2009 the manor house underwent extensive renovation prior to opening in September 2018 as a hotel with restaurants, a spa and screening room. The 220 acres of pleasure grounds, former site of The Grove, and the 180-acre Home Farm form a consolidated landholding, fringed by its own woodland, and by fishing on the River Whitewater. With a tagline of &#x27;Calling all Curious Minds,’ a programme of varied events, including workshops, screenings and talks, known as The Assembly, is staged at the property.
If the House is the heart of Heckfield, the certified-organic farm is its soul. In the process of achieving biodynamic status at the end of 2020, the farm provides much for the House: from flowers to rotating arable crops and honey.
In 2020 Heckfield Place opened its own micro-dairy, which generates raw milks, cream, butter and yogurts for the House. The milk from its 38 Guernsey cows is creating cheese with local cheesemaker Village Maid and there are 59 Suffolk as well as Hampshire and Southdown sheep. In terms of pigs, there are also 35 British saddlebacks – the closest match to the original Heckfield pig mentioned in the Spectator in 1850 bred by Lord Eversley – which supply the manor house and restaurants (called Marle and open-fired Hearth). They help control the grass and bring fertility to the soil, a vital part of the biodynamic closed circle.

The farm also has two flocks of 400 free-range Hyline chickens roaming the farm and providing eggs for the Kitchens, while 20 beehives buzz around the 500-strong orchard, where the blossoms of apple, pear, greengages, damsons, cherries, medlars and more help them create delicious honeycomb for the table.

Seven new glasshouses each set to different temperatures propagate everything that goes into the cut garden, nurturing lettuces, soft fruits, brassicas, squash and a variety of species of tomatoes, as well as providing for year-round fresh flowers including narcissi, tulips, ranunculi, roses, delphiniums, grasses, berries, and various edible blossoms surrounded by a living hedge of hawthorns, mulberries and blackberries. Everything grown on the farm forms the basis of the root-to-plate feasts served the table and the floral arrangements throughout the Estate.

The General Manager is Kevin Brooke and Skye Gyngell is the Culinary Director.

<doc id="952486" wikidata="Q959277" url="?curid=952486" title="Ali Boulala">
<text>Ali Boulala (born 28 January 1979) is a Swedish professional skateboarder, who has appeared in the Flip Skateboards videos &quot;Sorry&quot; and &quot;Really Sorry&quot;, Osiris&#x27; &quot;Subject to Change&quot;, and numerous Baker Skateboards videos.

==Early life==
Boulala was born in Stockholm, Sweden, and is of Finnish and Algerian descent.

==Professional skateboarding==
Boulala is sponsored by Flip Skateboards, Independent trucks and Flip wheels. In 2010, Boulala was invited to rejoin the Kr3w Clothing Team, but is no longer listed as a team member on the brand&#x27;s website as of 2014.

Boulala&#x27;s skateboarding concentrated on the unusual, as he preferred to skate in obscure locations and experiment with skateboard tricks. He is also well known for his attempt to ollie the Lyon 25, a twenty-five-stair stairwell in Lyon, France, as shown in the Flip 2002 video release &quot;Sorry&quot;. He is also famous for having a part in all of the Baker Skateboard Videos.

Boulala appeared on the front cover of &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; magazine and about 100,000 units of his signature skateboard decks have been sold since he became a professional skateboarder in 1997.

==Death of Shane Cross==
On 7 March 2007, Shane Cross died in a motorcycle crash in Melbourne, Australia — he was a passenger on a motorcycle driven by Boulala, who was seriously injured in the crash. Prior to the crash, both riders were affected by alcohol, and neither wore helmets as a safety precaution before embarking on the ride. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, published in Sydney, Australia, disclosed in a post-accident article:

Boulala had a blood alcohol concentration of .162 and Cross, who died in hospital, had a blood alcohol level of .18.

Boulala and Cross had earlier been at a city nightspot, the Cherry Bar. Then, they went to a friend&#x27;s house to drink beer. County Court Judge Sue Pullen said Boulala slammed into the hotel wall at an estimated 30 km/h about 1:05am after doing two to three laps around the block.
Following a four-month coma that left him unable to skate, Boulala was subsequently charged, found guilty of culpable driving, and spent two years in an Australian prison.

==Personal life==

Boulala is a member of a friendship group called the &quot;Piss Drunx&quot; (PD), together with Aaron Pearcy, Jim Greco, Andrew Reynolds, Erik Ellington, and Dustin Dollin. Dollin explained in a 2011 interview that the brand &quot;Shake Junt&quot; is the &quot;new Piss Drunx.&quot;

He returned to drug use after being released from prison, but eventually began attending a twelve-step program and has been sober since 2013. In 2022, he said that his primary pastime is music.

==Video game appearances==
Boulala is a playable character in the Electronic Arts video game: &quot;Skate&quot;.

<text>Gordon Korman (born October 23, 1963) is a Canadian author of children&#x27;s and young adult fiction books. Korman&#x27;s books have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide over a career spanning four decades and have appeared at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Early life==
Korman was born in Montreal, Quebec, where he lived until 1970. He grew up in Thornhill, Ontario (just north of Toronto) and attended German Mills Public School and public high school at Thornlea Secondary School.

He moved to the United States to attend university at New York University where he studied film and film-writing. Korman received a BFA from New York University in 1985; with a degree in dramatic visual writing and a minor in motion picture and television.

==Career==
Korman wrote his first book when he was 12 years old, as part of an English class taught by a PE teacher in 7th grade. This became the manuscript for &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Happening at Macdonald Hall&quot;, the first book in his Macdonald Hall series. Korman was the Scholastic Arrow Book Club monitor for the class; after completing the assignment, he mailed his manuscript to Scholastic. &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Happening at Macdonald Hall&quot; was published by Scholastic Press in 1978 when Korman was only 14 years old. Before graduating from high school in Thornhill, Ontario, Korman wrote and published five books.

Korman has written 105 books, with his hundredth being &quot;The Fort&quot;. His books have sold more than 35 million copies.

<text>John Doyle (born 1957) is a Canadian writer who was a television critic at &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; from 2000 until his retirement in 2022.

== Early life ==
John Doyle was born in 1957 in Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland, and came to Canada in 1980.

== Career ==
Doyle was first hired by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; to write for &quot;Broadcast Week&quot;, the paper&#x27;s weekly television listings, as a columnist. In 2000, he was appointed the newspaper&#x27;s daily television critic. Doyle also covers soccer for the paper. His writing on soccer has appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the ECW Press anthology &quot;Best Canadian Sports Writing&quot;, and the soccer magazine &quot;Eight by Eight&quot;.

In 2005, Doyle published his first book, the memoir &quot;A Great Feast of Light: Growing Up Irish in the Television Age&quot; about his early life in deeply conservative rural Ireland, and the book &quot;The World is a Ball: The Joy, Madness, and Meaning of Soccer&quot;. Doyle has covered multiple FIFA World Cup, Euro tournaments, and the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

In 2004 he was involved in a public disagreement with Bill O&#x27;Reilly, then of Fox News. O&#x27;Reilly complained about Doyle&#x27;s writing on his TV show. An article he published in 2010 argued that the Giller Prize and Gemini Awards were elitist. In a 2017 review of &quot;The Great Canadian Baking Show&quot;, Doyle called Dan Levy &quot;&quot;. Levy, and a CBC critic, argued that Doyle&#x27;s use of the term was homophobic.

<doc id="952514" wikidata="Q53842" url="?curid=952514" title="Kuroshio Current">
<text>The , also known as the Black Current or is a north-flowing, warm ocean current on the west side of the North Pacific Ocean basin. It was named for the deep blue appearance of its waters. Similar to the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, the Kuroshio is a powerful western boundary current that transports warm equatorial water poleward and forms the western limb of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Off the East Coast of Japan, it merges with the Oyashio Current to form the North Pacific Current.

The Kuroshio Current has significant effects on both physical and biological processes of the North Pacific Ocean, including nutrient and sediment transport, major pacific storm tracks and regional climate, and Pacific mode water formation. Additionally, the current&#x27;s significant nutrient transport results in a biologically rich ecoregion supporting an important fishing industry as well as diverse marine food webs. The South China Sea for example has relatively low nutrient concentrations in its upper waters, but experiences enhanced biological productivity due to the input from the Kuroshio Current Intrusion. Ongoing research centered around the Kuroshio Current&#x27;s response to climate change predicts a strengthening in surface flows of this western boundary current which contrasts the predicted changes in the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s Gulf Stream.

==History==

It was discovered in 1565 by Andrés de Urdaneta, a native of Guipuzcoa, colonial administrator, supervisor of nautical expeditions, corregidor, Augustinian monk and loyal navigator in the service of King Philip II, when, aboard the nao &quot;San Pedro&quot;, he was the first to open the &quot;tornaviaje&quot; between Cebu (Philippines) and the coasts of Old California (New Spain). The secret of the tornaviaje gave Spain absolute hegemony over the Pacific Ocean for centuries, a hegemony that was embodied in the so-called &quot;Manila Galleon&quot;.

== Physical properties ==
The Kuroshio is a relatively warm ocean current with an annual average sea-surface temperature of about , is approximately wide, and produces frequent small to meso-scale eddies. The Kuroshio originates from the Pacific North Equatorial Current, which splits in two at the east coast of Luzon, Philippines, to form the southward-flowing Mindanao Current and the more significant northward-flowing Kuroshio Current. East of Taiwan, the Kuroshio enters the Sea of Japan through a deep break in the Ryukyu island chain known as the Yonaguni Depression. The Kuroshio then continues northwards and parallel to the Ryukyu islands, steered by the deepest part of the Sea of Japan, the Okinawa Trough, before leaving the Sea of Japan and re-entering the Pacific through the Tokara Strait. It then flows along the southern margin of Japan but meanders significantly. At the Bōsō Peninsula, the Kuroshio finally separates from the Japanese coast and travels eastward as the Kuroshio Extension. The Kuroshio Current is the Pacific analogue of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, transporting warm, tropical water northward toward the polar region.

The Kuroshio&#x27;s counterparts associated with the North Pacific Gyre are the: east flowing North Pacific Current to the north, the south flowing California Current to the east, and the west flowing North Equatorial Current to the south. The warm waters of the Kuroshio Current sustain the coral reefs of Japan, the northernmost coral reefs in the world. The part of the Kuroshio that branches into the Sea of Japan is called .
Similar to the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current creates warm ocean surface temperatures, and significant moisture in the atmosphere along the western Pacific basin, and thus produces and sustains tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones, also known as typhoons, are formed when atmospheric instability, warm ocean surface temperatures, and moist air are combined to fuel an atmospheric low-pressure system. The Western North Pacific Ocean experiences an average of 25 typhoons annually. The majority of typhoons occur from July through October during northern hemisphere summer, and typically form where the Kuroshio Current is the warmest near the equator. Typhoons tend to track along the current&#x27;s warm water poleward until they dissipate in colder waters.

The strength (transport) of the Kuroshio varies along its path and seasonally. Within the Sea of Japan, observations suggest that the Kuroshio transport is relatively steady at about 25Sv (25 million cubic metres per second). The Kuroshio strengthens significantly when it rejoins the Pacific Ocean, reaching 65Sv (65 million cubic metres per second) southeast of Japan, although this transport has significant seasonal variability. The Kuroshio Current splits into Kuroshio Current extension and the Tsushima Current, as the currents wrap around Japanese Island and reconnects, changes in flow will impact the flows of the other currents.

The path of the Kuroshio may have been different in the geologic past based on historical sea level and bathymetry, however there is currently conflicting scientific evidence. It has been proposed that lower sea-level and tectonics may have prevented the Kuroshio from entering the Sea of Japan during the last glacial period, approximately c. 115,000 – c. 11,700 years ago, and remained entirely within the Pacific basin. However, other proxies and ocean models have alternatively suggested that the Kuroshio path was relatively unaltered, possibly as far back as 700,000 years ago.

=== Sediment transport ===
The magnitude of the Kuroshio Current and seafloor bathymetry results in deep sea erosion and sediment transport in multiple regions. Offshore of Southern Taiwan on the Kenting Plateau erosion is likely caused by the strong bottom currents which increase in velocity along the rise on this plateau. The bottom water accelerates as it travels from a depth of 3500 m to a depth around 400–700 m. The increase in current velocity exacerbates erosion revealing the Kuroshio Knoll, a 3 km × 7 km bean-shaped elevated flat area 60–70 m below surface levels in comparison to the rest of the Plateau which located at around 400–700 m. The Plateau is being uplifted and is balanced with erosion.

The granulometry of the Kenting Plateau and surrounding area demonstrates the eroding qualities of the Kuroshio Current. The sediment grain size of the sand varies along the edge of the Plateau. The deeper down the edge, the larger the grains as smaller grains are swept away by the current. Some of these fine sand particles have settled into a dune field while the remaining sediment is transported and deposited throughout the region by the Kuroshio Current.

The Kuroshio Current also transports Yangtze River sediment. The amount of sediment transport is highly dependent on the relationship between the Kuroshio Current intrusion, the China Coastal Current, and the Taiwan Warm Current. The Yangtze River sediment is being deposited on the East China Sea inner shelf rather than the deep sea due to the interaction of the three currents.
Distinct elemental characteristics of sediments from differing sources permits tracking sources of sediments within the Kuroshio. Taiwanese sediment notably contains illite and chlorite. These traceable compounds have been found all the way through the Kuroshio Current up into its branch through the Kuroshio Current Intrusion in the South China Sea. The South China Sea branch of the Kuroshio and the cyclonic eddy west of Luzon Island impact Luzon and Pearl River sediments. The Luzon sediment containing high levels of smectite is unable to travel northwestward. The Pearl River sediments contains high levels of kaolinite and titanium (Ti) and is trapped above the abyssal basin between Hainan Island and the Pearl River mouth. These compounds allow scientists to track sediment transport throughout the Kuroshio Current.

=== Eddies ===
There are indications that eddies contribute to the preservation and survival of fish larvae transported by the Kuroshio. Plankton biomass fluctuates yearly and is typically highest in the eddy area of the Kuroshio&#x27;s edge. Warm-core rings are not known for having high productivity. However, there is evidence of equal distribution of biological productivity throughout the warm-core rings from the Kuroshio Current, supported by the upwelling at the periphery and the convective mixing caused by the cooling of surface water as the rings move north of the current. The thermostad is the deep mixed layer that has discrete boundaries and uniform temperature. Within this layer, nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface, which generates a burst of primary production. Given that the water in the core of a ring has a different temperature regime than the shelf waters, there are times when a warm-core ring is undergoing its spring bloom while the surrounding shelf waters are not.
There are many complex interactions within warm-core rings and thus, lifetime productivity is not very different from the surrounding shelf water. A study from 1998 found that the primary productivity within a warm-core ring was almost the same as in the cold jet outside it, with evidence of upwelling of nutrients within the ring. In addition, there was discovery of dense populations of phytoplankton at the nutricline within a ring, presumably supported by the upward mixing of nutrients. Furthermore, there have been acoustic studies in the warm-core ring, which showed intense sound scattering from zooplankton and fish populations in the ring and very sparse acoustic signals outside of it.

=== Typhoons ===
Typhoons can produce intense winds which push on the surface layer of the ocean for brief periods of time. These winds induce the warmer surface layer of the ocean to mix with the deeper cooler layer of water that is situated below the pycnocline. This mixing introduces nutrients from deeper cooler water to the warmer surface layer of the ocean. Organisms such as phytoplankton and algae use these newly introduced nutrients to grow. In 2003, two typhoons induced significant surface layer mixing as they passed through the region. This mixing directly produced two algal bloom events in the North Western Pacific Ocean that negatively affected Japan.

==Nutrient transport==
The Kuroshio Current is considered a nutrient stream because of high nutrient flux from surrounding oligotrophic waters with primary production of 150 to 300 grams of carbon per square meter per year based on SeaWiFS global primary productivity estimates. The current transports significant amounts of nutrients to support this primary production from the East China Sea continental shelf to the subarctic Pacific Ocean. The maximum chlorophyll value is found around depth. Its importance in nutrient transport is demonstrated by the nutrient rich water in the Kuroshio Current is surrounded by ambient water of the same density with lower relative nutrient levels. The downstream of the Kuroshio Current receives large amounts of nutrients at rates of 100–280 kmol N*s-1. Nutrients are brought to the surface water from deeper layers where the Kuroshio Current flows over shallow areas and seamounts. This process occurs over the Okinawa Trough and the Tokara Strait. The Tokara Strait also has high cyclonic activity where the Kuroshio Current passes through. This in combination with the Coriolis effect causes intense upwelling along the continental shelf. This upwelling and nutrient transport into surface layers is essential for primary production because these vital nutrients would otherwise be inaccessible to phytoplankton which need to remain in upper layers where sunlight is available for them to perform photosynthesis. The constant transport of nutrient rich waters to regions with high levels of light therefore supports increased photosynthesis supporting the rest of the biologically diverse ecosystem associated with the Kuroshio current.

==Marine life==
The transportation of nutrients, heat and plankton by the Kuroshio Current and the current&#x27;s transection of multiple different waterbodies gives way to high species richness in and adjacent to this current. In addition, the Kuroshio is classified as a biodiversity hotspot, meaning the waters circulating through the region are host to many different species, yet many of its resident organisms are at risk of becoming endangered or are already at the brink of extinction as a result of local and/or global human activity. Overfishing and overharvest are the primary risks for many of the threatened or endangered species here.

=== Photoautotrophs ===

==== Phytoplankton ====
Phytoplankton are responsible for the aforementioned high rates of primary productivity within the current. Warm sea surface temperatures and low turbidity in the region lead to clearer waters which allows for deeper penetration of sunlight and an extension of the epipelagic zone. These particular characteristics, along with lower nutrient availability within the current, correspond well with the requirements of two specific cyanobacteria: &quot;Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus&quot;. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is the dominant species of picophytoplankton within the Kuroshio Current and these two species may be responsible for as much as half of the fixation of in the entire Kuroshio Current photic zone. Further, there are substantial dust deposition events in this region due to Asian Dust Storms from the Gobi desert. During these events, dust clouds transport and deposit phosphate and trace metals which subsequently stimulate growth in both &quot;Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus&quot; as well as diatoms.

Diatoms and Trichodesmium are speculated to play an important role in the redistribution of nitrogen and carbon in and out of the euphotic zone. Trichodesmium is an abundant diazotroph that directly correlates with overall nitrogen fixation within the current. This nitrogen fixation supplies a limiting nutrient (nitrate), to other photoautotrophs for growth and reproduction. Meanwhile, in areas influenced by upwelling with higher nutrient and carbon concentrations, diatoms are important contributors to carbon and nitrogen out of the euphotic zone due to the weight of their &quot;glass houses&quot; made of silica and their tendencies to sink.

====Macro-flora====
At least ten genera of seaweed reside in waters in and around the Kuroshio Current. &quot;Caulerpa&quot;, is a green algae that grows densely near shore on the periphery of the Kuroshio Current while brown and red algae also flourish adjacent the current, and like other photosynthesizing organisms, benefit from the nutrient transport and low turbidity of the region.

=== Invertebrates ===

==== Zooplankton ====
An increase in zooplankton biomass occurs in the significantly lower water temperatures of the upwelling sites within the Kuroshio Current due to high phytoplankton concentrations which are nourished by upwelling northeast of Taiwan. This upwelling event, the Kuroshio Current intrusion through the Luzon Strait and South China Sea, and summer monsoons, represent the convergence of a multitude of oceanic waters of different origin. These water convergence zones and subsequent circulation and mixing, have a major influence on the transport and distribution of many zooplankton species causing zooplankton communities to be more nutritious, unique and diverse. High diversity in copepods in waters adjacent the Kuroshio Current have also been reported. Two dominant copepod species of the current, &quot;C. sinicus&quot; and &quot;E. concinna&quot;, are transported northward in high concentrations by the current from the East China Sea in winter.

Like copepods and diatoms, tunicates, specifically salps and doliolids, also play an important role on the biogeochemical cycle as well as on the food web in the Kuroshio. Salps transport carbon to the region&#x27;s bottom water with their carbon-rich, fast-sinking fecal pellets and carcasses. &quot;Thaliaceans&quot; (salps and doliolids) are known to feed a minimum of 202 marine species, however, these animal&#x27;s blooms have been found to cause harmful feeding conditions for pelagic fishes in the region.

Many species of fish larvae are also found in zooplankton communities transported by the current. Fish larvae are important contributor to the Kuroshio Current system food chain. Baleen whales for instance, make use of the current&#x27;s transport of Japanese sardine and jack mackerel larvae to their feeding grounds in the north pacific. Climate change is reported to alter endemic fish larvae distribution. A fish species composition change analysis by Lu and Lee (2014) showed changes in fish larvae distribution have occurred during the region and suggest this altered clustering is associated with changes in the intensities and flow rates of the Kuroshio Current. These changes impacts the food chain below and above this trophic level. This can influence fish migration, fish population&#x27;s at large and major fisheries.

The Kuroshio Current has an influence of several species of foraminifera, including species &quot;G. ruber&quot; and &quot;P. obliquiloculate&quot;. &quot;G. ruber&quot; is normally a surface dweller and was found at depths of 1000 meters along the Kuroshio Current. &quot;P. obliquiloculate&quot; normally resides between 25 and 100 m, yet was found deep in the abyssal basin (&gt;1000 m). The distribution of these species in comparison to their standard dwelling depths observed by Gallagher (2015) demonstrates the ability of this intrusion and the overall Kuroshio Current&#x27;s to redistribute nutrients vertically making nutrients available many different species with differing requirements for prosperity.

==== Coral ====
The coral reefs within the Kuroshio Current reside at a higher latitude than any other tropical reef placement in the world (33.48°N). An important reef-building coral to this area, &quot;Heliopora coerulea&quot;, has been listed as threatened due to anthropogenic stressors to its environment such as: warming sea surface temperatures from climate change, ocean acidification from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and dynamite fishing. Studies confirming low genotypic diversity within the species further emphasizes this blue coral&#x27;s threatened status.

&quot;Acropora japonica&quot;, &quot;Acropora secale&quot;, and &quot;Acropora hyacinthus&quot; are 3 more reef-building corals in the region. These species utilize symbiotic relationships with zooxanthellae, peridinin and pyrrhoxanthin, as a source of carotenoids.

In addition to anthropogenic, threats, these corals also have predators in the region such as the Crown-of-thorns starfish, &quot;Acanthaster planci&quot;, and a regional sea snail, &quot;Drupella fragum&quot;. The Crown-of-thorns starfish feeds on corals. When conditions are favorable, the population of this native starfish can explode, resulting in significant damage on entire coral communities, as well as the ecosystems these coral reefs support. A Crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak in conjunction with anthropogenic stressors can cause irreversible reef-system damage.

The Kuroshio Current controls patterns of connectivity between coral reefs (as well as other marine organisms with a larval phase), transporting larvae from southerly coral reefs to downstream reefs along the Ryukyu Arc.

====Squid====
Western boundary currents are used by certain species of squid for rapid and easy transport, allowing mature squid to travel with minimum energy expenditure to exploit rich northern feeding grounds, while eggs and larvae develop in the warm current waters during winter. The Japanese flying squid (&quot;Todarodes pacificus&quot;), for example, has three populations that breed in winter, summer, and autumn. The winter spawning group is associated with the Kuroshio Current, because following spawning events in January to April in the East China Sea the larvae and juveniles travel north with the Kuroshio Current. They are turned inshore and are caught between the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido during the summer. The summer spawning is in another part of the East China Sea, from which the larvae are entrained into the Tsushima current that flows north between the islands of Japan and the mainland. Afterward, the current meets a southward flowing cold coastal current, the Liman Current. The group of squid spawned in the summer are traditionally found around the boundary between the two currents, sustaining rich fisheries. In fact, studies have reported that annual catches in Japan have gradually increased since the late 1980s and it has been proposed that changing environmental conditions have caused the autumn and winter spawning areas in the Tsushima Strait and near the Goto Islands to overlap. In addition, winter spawning sites over the continental shelf and slope in the East China Sea are expanding.

=== Vertebrates ===
==== Fish ====
The Kuroshio Current is home to thousands of fish species occupying nutrient rich and diverse waters in this region. This expansive biomass is influenced by elevated rates of primary production leading to large biomass in the lower trophic levels, facilitated by warmer local oceanic and atmospheric conditions. Resident fish of this area include reef fish like rabbitfish and parrotfish, pelagic fishes such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel, and sailfish, and higher trophic predators such as sharks.

Fisheries have a strong presence in this area and depend strongly on the changing oceanic conditions, largely dependent on the Kuroshio Current. To the north, the Oyashio Current contains subarctic water that is much colder and fresher than the resident water east of Honshu, and the intersection of these two currents is called the Kuroshio-Oyashio region. Here, local oceanographic conditions vary through the year and determine the species assemblage and thus the success of fisheries. For example, when the Oyashio current is well developed and protrudes southward, the cold waters are favorable for capturing sardines. Additionally, when larger meandering flow develops in the Kuroshio Current, sardine availability elevates due to the proximity of the Kuroshio to the southern spawning grounds of sardine. Thus, intrusion and flow paths of these currents affect presence, biomass, and catch of species such as pollock, sardine, and anchovy.

==== Marine reptiles ====
Five out of the seven sea turtle species on earth, loggerheads (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;), green (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;), hawksbill (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;), leatherbacks (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;), and Olive ridleys (&quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot;), utilize the Kuroshio Current to access warm waters. Female sea turtles utilize the transport potential of the current to access the warm nesting beaches of Japan&#x27;s shores, and adolescent green and hawksbill turtles utilize the current transport to access waters surrounding Japan.

==== Marine mammals ====
Marine mammals such as seals, sea lions and cetaceans also make use of the high biodiversity within the Kuroshio Current. Charismatic megafauna odontocetes in this region include the Spinner dolphin (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;), short-finned pilot whale (&quot;Globicephala macrorhynchus&quot;), common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;), Dall&#x27;s porpoise (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli&quot;), Risso&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;) and the killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;). Three types of whales of the same genus (&quot;Balaenoptera&quot;) also use this rich area for feeding grounds, including the common Minke (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata&quot;), the sei whale (&quot;Balaenoptera borealis&quot;) and Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera edeni&quot;). The availability of Japanese sardines and mackerel eggs, larvae, and juveniles are the baleen whales&#x27; primary food sources in these areas. Top-tier trophic predators can serve as units in developing conservation management in this region.

== Carbonate chemistry ==
The ocean absorbs approximately one third of the CO2 produced by fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and deforestation. One of the more significant oceanic sinks for atmospheric CO2 is the Kuroshio Current. In its highly biologically productive regions, this uptake of CO2 is carbon burial is facilitated by a strong biological pump. In the less productive northern current transition, the Kuroshio remains an important CO2 sink, through high CO2 solubility. The Kuroshio Extension region is classified as the strongest sink for atmospheric CO2 in the North Pacific. This is especially true in the winter when higher amounts of human-produced CO2 are taken up in the Kuroshio Extension region when compared with the summer. This is likely explained by cooler temperatures facilitating the solubility of CO2 in ocean water. As CO2 levels continue to increase in the atmosphere, so does CO2 uptake in the Kuroshio, making this seasonality more dramatic.

== Climate implications ==
Western boundary currents are integrated parts in the world&#x27;s climatic balance. The Kuroshio Current plays an important role in influencing regional climate and weather patterns mainly through the input of warm waters from lower latitudes northward into the western edge of the Pacific basin. Along with the other western boundary currents in the world, the Kuroshio Current is subject to seasonal changes that manifest in different flow rates, bifurcation latitudes, and water salinity. Circulation within the Pacific Ocean is largely influenced by this northerly transport of warm salty water north along the Western boundary, concurrently providing structure to the western edge of the North Pacific Gyre. The resulting heat fluxes in this area represent some of the largest heat exchanges from ocean to atmosphere within the entire Pacific Basin, being more pronounced during the winter season. Heat transfer from the surface ocean to the atmosphere creates unstable atmospheric conditions, which is to say that air parcels and clouds derived or influenced by this process are warmer than the surrounding air, ultimately rising and enhancing chances of precipitation or shifting weather. In this way, monsoonal rain events and common through the summertime and typhoon storms are enhanced as they pass over the current. The climate of many Asian countries has been affected by the distribution of heat by these processes for millions of years, changing wind patterns, precipitation, and mixing warm tropical waters into the Sea of Japan.

=== Mode water formation ===
As the Kuroshio Current separates from the equatorial current and flows northward, warm water from the Western Pacific Warm Pool segues into the northwest Pacific Ocean Basin. Principal heat flux in the Kuroshio occurs via the Kuroshio Extension between 132°E and 160°E and 30°N to 35°N, depending on the latitude where the extension splits off from the Kuroshio Current along the coast of Japan. The process of warm water injection into the open ocean plays an important role in the formation of North Pacific Subtropical Mode waters and the regulation of sea surface temperatures, affecting moisture transport across the western Pacific Basin. North Pacific subtropical mode waters are created when Kuroshio Extension waters lose large amounts of heat and moisture to the cold and dry northerly winds during boreal wintertime months, creating dense salty surface waters prone to sink and cause convection. The temperature range of the sinking North Pacific Subtropical Mode Waters characteristically falls between 16 °C and 19 °C, however exact temperatures and depths to which these waters sink varies annually depending on the efficiency of water transportation by the extension, which is a function of atmospheric and mesoscale eddy conditions. The resulting homogeneous water mass typically separates the seasonal pycnocline from the surface waters in the mid to late summer months, remaining stratified below the warmer surface waters until shoaling back towards the surface with the mixed layer due to storm perturbation in the fall and winter. The contrast between the temperatures of these stratified vertical layers can be discernable such that the lateral advection of mode water can be traced for thousands of kilometers. Mode water formation is variable and largely dependent on the flow intensity of the Kuroshio Extension and atmospheric heat flux efficiencies. Heat flux processes sometimes experience feedbacks that enhance water temperature contrasts and can cause sea surface temperature features to last well past the end of the boreal winter. For example, with residually cooled surface waters in the late spring and early summer months, warm moist air from the south can cause low cloud formation and reflection of solar radiation, extending temporal sea surface cooling.

The Kuroshio Extension is a dynamic but relatively unstable system, with variability in the associated bifurcation latitude occurring on interannual time scales. The cause of these variations and their effects on the surface flow and total transport of waters has been studied extensively, with recent advances in sea surface height satellite altimetry methods allowing for observational studies on larger timescales. Studies suggest that more northerly bifurcation latitudes have been historically correlated with greater surface water transport and mode water formation, associated with less meandering and more direct flow paths closer to the coasts of Japan and Taiwan during the wintertime months.

=== Climate change ===
Climate change, specifically with respect to increasing sea surface temperatures and decreasing salinity, has been predicted to strengthen the surface flow of the Kuroshio Current as well as other western boundary currents across the Pacific. The predicted effects of warming surface oceans may result in differing impacts between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans; the Atlantic is predicted to experience a slowing of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation while the Pacific western boundary currents, including the Kuroshio Current, may strengthen. These changes are thought to come as a product of wind stress and surface warming resulting from the increased stratification of the surface layers of future oceans. Specifically, predicted poleward shifting of westerly winds within the Hadley Cell is thought to create conditions in which the subtropical gyre wind stress curl would increase. This could cause an increased total geostrophic circulation and subsequently an intensification of the northern leg of the Kuroshio Current, in some predictions increasing flow velocities by almost double. The entire flow of the current is predicted to be strengthened however, from its point of bifurcation near the equator to the Kuroshio Extension. In addition, the general observed southward migration of both the NEC and SEC subcurrent bifurcation latitudes over the past thirty years has been consistent with a strengthening of western boundary currents. With shifting winds and increased gyre circulation in conjunction with a &quot;business as usual&quot; anthropogenic carbon input scenario, bifurcation latitudes are predicted to continue on poleward migrations into the future, contributing to the intensifying Kuroshio Current.

Predictions are made using methods that combine historical data with oceanic modelling output, and one such study used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to show the Kuroshio Current interacting with the northern extremity of the subtropical gyre, contrasting older predictions of simple gyre &quot;spin up&quot; forced acceleration. Modelling studies have also suggested that increasing stratification will occur with the strengthening of the surface layer current, creating conditions in which the opposite effect could occur in the deeper layer of the Kuroshio Current, which has been proposed to slow. The exact mechanisms causing this change are not well elucidated, however it is expected to be the result of wind stress changes within the gyre in addition to the increased stratification near the surface that may enhance surface and deep ocean layer separation and maintain different responses to warming oceans.

== Economic considerations ==
The Kuroshio Current can be useful as a shipping lane as the current can save time and fuel usage when underway with the current. However, ships that travel against the current will spend more time and fuel to compensate for the water flowing against the shipping vessel.

The Kuroshio supports many important fisheries. Jack Mackerel populations are one of the most important fishery resources in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. As the Kuroshio flows northeastward from northeast of Taiwan along the shelf slope of the Eastern China Sea, it carries Jack Mackerel eggs and larvae to southern Japan and Honshu Island. These larvae are caught and then raised in aquaculture through adulthood and harvested. Other important fisheries include pollock, sardine, and anchovy.

There are also many developing port cities along the Kuroshio Current. While the Kuroshio Current is historically known to support many fisheries where it meets with the Oyashio current, this region is still recovering from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. In 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami in 2011. This tsunami inundated more than 200 miles of Japan&#x27;s coastline and drastically altered the sea level in some coastal areas by meters. It killed more than 18,500 people and set off a nuclear disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant, releasing radiocesium into the surrounding waters. While local water bodies were the most severely affected, this radiocesium was transported as far as the entire North Pacific Ocean by the North Pacific Current which is formed by the collision of the Kuroshio and the Oyashio current. Local fisheries lost over 90% of their fleets and were unable to resume operations for up to a year after the accident. The local economy has been working to return to pre-tsunami levels but, even now, fishery yields have not reached nearly the levels they were before the accident. No catches are made within a 10 km radius to the accident site and even catches outside of that zone are subject to inspection for radioactive materials, costing fisheries both time and money. Minamisanriku had most of the town&#x27;s port and aquaculture facilities restored by 2014, and as of 2018, reconstruction of key infrastructure in the prefectures of Iwate and Miyagi was near completion. Local Japanese fishing fleets hauled 5,928 tons of seafood product valued at over 2.21 billion yen (19.342 million U.S. dollars) in 2021.

Changes in the Kuroshio Current and its warming conditions have impacted pilot whale migration. These animals are considered a delicacy but hunting is strictly regulated and transitions in migration timing is impacting those who depend on these animals as a source of income. Management practices must consider protecting these animals and recognizing the potential economic impacts on local hunters.

<doc id="952521" wikidata="Q171387" url="?curid=952521" title="Interlagos Circuit">
<text>The Autódromo José Carlos Pace, better known as Autódromo de Interlagos or simply Interlagos, is a motorsport circuit located in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. It was inaugurated on 12 May 1940, by the federal intervener of the São Paulo province, Adhemar de Barros. In 1985, the circuit was renamed to honor the Formula 1 driver José Carlos Pace, who died in a plane crash in 1977. Attached to its facilities there is a kart circuit named after Ayrton Senna. It runs counterclockwise.

It is internationally known for hosting the Lollapalooza music festival. It has hosted the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix since 1973. It also hosted the Brazilian motorcycle Grand Prix in 1992, the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft in 1996, the FIA GT1 World Championship in 2010, and the FIA World Endurance Championship from 2012 to 2014. As the major racetrack in the country it also hosted many previous and active national championships such as Stock Car Brasil, Campeonato Sudamericano de GT, Fórmula Truck, Copa Truck, Formula 3 Sudamericana, Brazilian Formula Three Championship, and Mil Milhas Brasil. In addition, the Prova Ciclística 9 de Julho road cycling race was held at the venue from 2002 to 2006 and from 2008 to 2013.

==History==

The land on which the circuit is located was originally bought in 1926 by property developers who wanted to build housing. Following difficulties partly due to the 1929 stock market crash, it was decided to build a racing circuit instead; construction started in 1938 and the track was inaugurated on 12 May 1940. Its design was inspired by tracks such as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Roosevelt Raceway in the United States, Brooklands in England, and Montlhéry in France.

The traditional name of the circuit, Interlagos (in Portuguese, &quot;between lakes&quot;), comes from its location on the neighborhood of the same name, a region between two large artificial lakes, Guarapiranga and Billings, built in the early 20th century to supply the metropolitan region of São Paulo with water and electric power. The name &quot;Interlagos&quot; was suggested by the French architect and urban planner Alfred Agache after the Interlaken region located in Switzerland. Interlagos was renamed in 1985 to &quot;Autódromo José Carlos Pace&quot; in honor of the Brazilian Formula One driver José Carlos Pace, who died in a plane crash in 1977.

Formula One started racing at Interlagos in 1972, when the event was run as a non-championship race (won by Argentinean Carlos Reutemann). The first World Championship Brazilian Grand Prix was held there in 1973, and it was won by defending Formula One World Champion and São Paulo local Emerson Fittipaldi. Fittipaldi won the race again the following year, and José Carlos Pace won his only race at Interlagos in 1975.

Due to safety concerns with the original layout, including a bumpy surface, the inadequate barriers, deep ditches and embankments, the last Formula One race held on the original Interlagos was in 1980, when it was nearly cancelled after protests by many Formula One drivers – including defending world champion Jody Scheckter. The safety concerns were directed towards the track surface, which BBC commentator Murray Walker described as &quot;appallingly bumpy&quot;. Most of the ground-effect cars of 1980 were designed in such a way that bumpy surfaces were barely tolerable for the drivers. These factors meant that Formula One would move back to the Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro, hometown of established star Nelson Piquet and where the Brazilian Grand Prix was held in 1978. After Formula One moved away, the only major race being held at Interlagos was the Mil Milhas Brasil, and the last major race on the original circuit was the 1989 Mil Milhas Brasil. Formula One returned to the circuit in 1990 after it had been shortened and modified at a cost of $15 million. The track layout, aside from the pit exit being extended along the &quot;Curva do Sol&quot; over the years has remained the same since 1990.
The circuit is often witness to dramatic results when it hosts the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix, especially since its move to an end of season slot in 2004. Fernando Alonso won both the 2005 and 2006 world titles in Brazil, with Renault also clinching the constructors&#x27; title in 2006. Kimi Räikkönen won the 2007 World Championship here after being seven points down and in third place in the championship entering the final race of the season. Felipe Massa almost won the 2008 Driver&#x27;s World Championship when he finished the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix as winner, but after he finished, Lewis Hamilton overtook Timo Glock and was crowned World Champion. Despite Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s pole position in 2009, Mark Webber won the race and Jenson Button won the championship for Brawn after starting 14th. Williams got their first pole since 2005 here at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix with Nico Hülkenberg. The race was won by Sebastian Vettel, and with Mark Webber coming second, Red Bull secured the constructors title; however the driver&#x27;s title was not confirmed until the last race of the season.

During the weekend of the 2023 race, one roof in the complex came off because of bad weather.

==Characteristics==

One of the main characteristics of Interlagos is that it was not built on flat terrain, but follows the ups and downs of hilly ground, which makes it harder to drive and demands more power from the cars&#x27; engines. The races therefore can be tough on the car and physically demanding on the drivers, especially since the circuit runs counterclockwise, where the centrifugal forces in the many hard left turns push the drivers&#x27; necks to the right, instead of left as in most of the circuits on the F1 calendar. The hilly course is also a good feature for road cycling races, which are usually held at the circuit.

Additionally to the physical aspects there is also a climate component to the venue, the region where the track is located is known for having rapid changes in weather with outbursts of rain being common, which can vary from a short lived drizzle to a torrential storm. This can add a degree of unpredictability to the races and it&#x27;s classically associated with the circuit. The city of São Paulo itself where the circuit is located is known by the nickname &quot;Land of the Drizzle&quot;.

===First reform===

In 1979 upgrading work was done and the pit lane was extended past the first left-hand turn (1), making the corner more narrow, and the pit lane ended right in the middle of turn 1 and 2. The present design of the track dates back to 1990, when the original circuit was shortened from to . As a consequence of the reduction, the track lost three long straight sections and nine fast curves (5 were lost forever, 4 were made slower and are still present). The original track was full of fast corners and it allowed cars to keep maximum speed for up for many seconds, it was considered dangerous, and in 1990 the old layout was mostly revised. The new track still had a very long top-speed section that contained bumps, high-speed turns and little run-off area though the track was very wide at this point.

===Improvement in 2007===
For the 2007 Brazilian Grand Prix, the largest-scale repairs in the last 35 years were carried out at the circuit, to fundamentally solve problems with the track surface. The existing asphalt was entirely replaced, resulting in a much smoother track surface. At the same time, the pit lane entrance was enhanced to improve safety and to add a new fixed grand stand. To facilitate the work, the circuit was closed and no events were held in the five months immediately preceding the race.

On 17 October 2007, Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) began to operate the new station of the Line C (currently called Line 9), &quot;Autódromo&quot;, near the circuit. The Line C had been extended to improve the access between the center of São Paulo and southern region of the Greater São Paulo including the circuit, improving circuit accessibility.

===Planned 2012 redevelopment===
Shortly before the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, FIA race director Charlie Whiting detailed several planned upgrades of the circuit, including a new pit entrance and expanded run-off at the final corner, as a response to several fatal accidents at the circuit in 2011. In June 2012, further details of the proposed plans emerged, calling for the construction of a brand new pit building and the relocation of the start line from its current position between Arquibancadas and the Senna &#x27;S&#x27; to Reta Oposta. However, later it was decided to keep start/finish straight at its current location along with the new pit building.

===Pit lane===
Interlagos has one of the longest pit-lanes ever used in Formula One, starting just before the start-finish straight and rejoining the main course after Curva do Sol. Entering the pits was originally not a trivial task, as the high speed and the left turning may force the car rightwards, out of the pits. The pit lane entrance received some changes to become safer for the 2007 Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix, and later for the 2014 Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix, when a chicane was added.

==Layout history==

==Track layout==
Race start is in the &quot;Tribunas&quot; section and features a long straight with an upward inclination, then comes &quot;S do Senna&quot; (the Senna S) [1,2], a pair of alternating downward turns (left then right) that exhibit different attack angles and inclinations.

&quot;S do Senna&quot; connects with &quot;Curva do Sol&quot; (Curve of the Sun) [3], a round-shaped large-radius left turn that leads to &quot;Reta Oposta&quot; (Opposite Straight) the track&#x27;s longest (but not the fastest) straight. Reta Oposta is succeeded by a pair of downhill left turns that are called &quot;Descida do Lago&quot; (Lake&#x27;s Descent) [4,5] into a short straight section that climbs up towards the back of the pit buildings.

This is followed by a slow section, with small, kart-like turns and elevation changes. The first of these turns is known as &quot;Ferradura&quot; (Horseshoe) [6,7] downhill and right into &quot;Laranjinha&quot; (Little Orange) [8], another right turn and the slowest point of the circuit; the next turn leads into &quot;Pinheirinho&quot; (Little Pine Tree) [9], left on a plain field; then comes &quot;Bico de Pato&quot; (Duck Bill) [10] a right turn with a tight hairpin like shape; and then &quot;Mergulho&quot; (Dive) [11], a constant-radius left-hand turn that slings the driver straight into a harder left at &quot;Junção&quot; (Junction) [12].

Turn [13] &quot;Café&quot; (Coffee), is a left up-hill kink and marks the start of the long top-speed section. Rising up through &quot;Subida dos Boxes&quot; (Up to the Pits) [14], the driver encounters a long uphill left turn with a gradient of 10% that demands a lot of power from the cars. At the end of it comes Arquibancadas (Bleachers) [15], a wide high velocity left turn that connects to the &quot;Tribunas&quot; straight to complete the final section of the track.

The series of left turns from the exit of &quot;Junção&quot; all the way to Turn 1 is typically taken at full throttle and treated as a long straight. This section is one of the longest full-throttle stretches on the Formula 1 calendar, and thus demanding of the engine&#x27;s reliability. Other notable stretches of this nature are the &quot;Rettifilo Tribune&quot; straight at Autodromo Nazionale di Monza and the Kemmel Straight at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps.

<doc id="952527" wikidata="Q1234289" url="?curid=952527" title="Dodge Magnum">
<text>The Dodge Magnum is a nameplate used by several Dodge vehicles, at different times and on various markets. The name was first applied to a large Chrysler B platform-based 2-door coupe marketed from 1978 to 1979 sold in the United States and Canada. From the 2005 to the 2008 model years, the nameplate was revived for a Charger-based station wagon on the rear-wheel drive Chrysler LX platform, produced in Canada and sold on the American and Canadian market.

In Brazil, the Magnum was a top-of-the-line version of the local Dodge Dart, produced from 1979 to 1981.

In Mexico, the Dodge Magnum was a sporty rear-wheel drive two-door car based on Chrysler&#x27;s M-body (American Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury). From 1983 to 1988 Dodge marketed a sporty two-door K-car as the &quot;Magnum&quot;, with an available turbocharger engine from 1984 on.

==US and Canada (1978–1979)==
The Magnum was introduced for 1978 to supplement the Dodge Charger. It was sold in two forms, the &quot;XE&quot; and the &quot;GT&quot; and was the last vehicle to use the long running Chrysler B platform. The appearance was somewhat of a rounded off Charger, and was in response to getting a car that would be eligible for NASCAR that would be more aerodynamic, something that the 1975–1978 Charger was not. Styling features included four rectangular headlights behind retractable clear covers, with narrow opera windows, and an optional T-bar or power sunroof. The Magnum was well-featured with power steering, brakes and seats; the suspension included Chrysler&#x27;s standard adjustable, longitudinal torsion bars, lower trailing links, and front and rear anti-sway bars. The base engine was the V8 with Lean-Burn, while two and four-barrel carbureted and V8s were optional; weight was nearly .

During the start of the 1979 model year, the 400 V8 engine was dropped from the options list as Chrysler stopped producing big-block V8 engines in production cars during the end of 1978 model year. A performance model, the &quot;GT&quot; had been available with the V8 during the previous model year (1978) and the &quot;E58&quot; police interceptor (360 V8-195 HP) engine was available during the 1979 model year along with HD suspension, special axle, special &quot;GT&quot; badging and a &quot;turned metal&quot; dash applique. Technology was advanced for the time with an onboard spark control computer from inception, electronic ignition, and a lockup torque converter. During the end of the 1979 model year, the mid-size B-body Dodge Magnum (along with its mid-size B-body based Chrysler Cordoba counterpart) was discontinued, as was with just the Magnum name itself, in favor of what would become a smaller, all newly designed, M-body platform based Mirada coupe (which also would be shared along with what would become its M-body platform based Chrysler Cordoba coupe counterpart as well) all during the next four model years (1980–1983). Only 3,704 1979 Dodge Magnum coupes included a T-Top.
===NASCAR===
The mid-size B-body 1978–1979 Dodge Magnum coupe in the United States and Canada was an addition to Chrysler&#x27;s line up that allowed Richard Petty to continue racing with a Mopar. For the 1978 NASCAR season, the 1974 Charger that Chrysler teams had continued to use was no longer eligible for competition. Chrysler worked on several car designs to smooth out the current 1975 bodied Charger into something that would be reasonably aerodynamic for the big racetracks and the Magnum design was settled on in the summer of 1977 for use in the 1978 racing season. While not as aerodynamic as the 1974 Charger body, the shape of the Magnum showed promise, and the &quot;Petty Enterprises&quot; built test cars reached on test runs. At first it seemed that out on the tracks the cars ran well with Petty almost winning his Daytona 125 (finishing second), and leading over 30 laps of the Daytona 500 until a blown front tire caused him to wreck. However, the lack of factory development support of the small-block Chrysler 360 V8 as a race engine was becoming more of a problem, and in high speed racing traffic the Magnum did not handle well. Petty was particularly harsh in his criticism of the car - before the season he declared, &quot;The Magnum is undriveable at 190 MPH.&quot;

By the latter half of the 1978 season, Petty and Neil Bonnett (the two top Mopar teams) gave up on the car&#x27;s inconsistent performance and switched to Chevrolets and Oldsmobiles, leaving independent drivers Buddy Arrington (who bought a few of Petty&#x27;s Magnums, along with some parts), Frank Warren, and Country singer Marty Robbins to soldier on without any substantial factory support (Chrysler did provide sheet metal and some engine parts to teams driving Magnums). From August 1978, two to five independent teams showed up with Magnums in NASCAR races, until January 1981, when NASCAR switched to smaller bodied cars. The Magnum never enjoyed the racing heritage of its predecessors, but it was not without its own achievements. Petty scored 7 top five finishes in his 17 races with the car, and Bonnett won three poles and scored 5 top five finishes with his. Petty recognized the Magnum with a commemorative decal, depicting his famous number 43 emblazoned on a Magnum for his 1992 Fan Appreciation Tour. Though Petty never won a race in a Magnum, his son, Kyle Petty drove one of his father&#x27;s year-old Dodge Magnums in his first race (1979 Daytona ARCA 200), and won. Kyle raced in five NASCAR races using the left-over Magnums in 1979, but wrecked them beyond reasonable repair by the 1980 Daytona 125. As of December 2012, only two NASCAR Magnums still existed; one (an ex-Petty car) resides in the Talladega NASCAR museum, and the other; (Marty Robbins&#x27; 1978 Magnum No. 42) has been restored and is owned by a private party in southern California.

Production Figures:

==Brazil (1979–1981)==

From 1969 until 1981 the Dodge Dart was produced in the old Simca Factory in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil. More than 92,000 cars were sold in this period. They were built with minor changes from the original model, starting in 1969, and were all largely based on the 1968 Dart GT (and GTS). For its last three years of production, a two-door upper trim level version of the Dart was sold as the &quot;Magnum&quot;, featuring the 318 cu in V8 engine used in all Dodge coupé and sedan models in Brazil. A unique fiberglass front fascia that included four headlights to give it a more modern look was used, while the rear end was very similar to the 1975 American Dart (the Dart model from the same year having been identical to the Swinger from USA). The Magnum (top of the line) was sold as a separate model from the Dart (bottom line), despite being technically almost identical to the Dart.

The Dodge was well received in Brazil. The coupe and sedan models in Brazil were (all variations from the Dart 1968 model): Dart [1969–1981] (as a 2-door coupé from 1970 until 1981 or as a four-door sedan from 1969 until 1981), sporting but lower priced Dart SE, better equipped Dart DeLuxo (two or four doors), Gran Coupé (more luxurious yet than the Dart DeLuxo, with two doors only), Gran Sedan (above the Dart DeLuxo model, with four doors only), Charger R/T [1971–1980] (coupé bodywork only, from 1971 to 1980 it was the top model in the sport segment), LeBaron (replacing the &#x27;Gran Sedan&#x27; with four-door sedan body, from 1979 to 1981) and Magnum (replacement for the Dart Gran Coupé, Brazil&#x27;s top model in the luxury segment from 1979 to 1981).
==Mexico (1981–1988)==
===First generation===
In 1980, the F-body cars were discontinued in Mexico, as well in the U.S., so the compact cars Dodge Dart (using the front of the Volaré and the rear of the Aspen), Valiant Volaré (using the front of the Aspen and the rear of the Volaré), and sporty Valiant Super Bee, were dropped for this year.

In 1979, Chrysler de México introduced the Chrysler LeBaron based on the M-body platform, and two years later it introduced the Dodge Diplomat as the Dodge Dart. These were very similar to the American Plymouth Gran Fury in appearance and trim, but had Chrysler&#x27;s Rallye wheels instead of deluxe wheel covers. Chrysler de México used a small platform and the Magnum name, equipping it with 360 CID (5.9 L) V8 engine (rated at , with a Carter ThermoQuad four barrel (four-choke) carburetor), Mopar oil cooler, a 3-speed A727 automatic transmission (A833 4-speed manual optional), heavy-duty suspension, power brakes, stabilizer bars in the front and rear and a Dana 44 differential with positive pass and posi-traction. All of the window trim was flat black; with only the bumpers and the grille chromed. Both the front fascia and the front fenders wore &quot;Magnum&quot; lettering, with a 5.9 L decal on the fenders as well. The Mexican Dodge Magnum was offered only for the 1981–1982 model years.
===Second generation===
The K-car based Mexican Dodge Magnum was a sporty 2-door compact, based on the Dodge Aries coupe body (with blackout 1982–1985 Dodge 400 grille in 1983–1985 and a blackout 1986–1988 Plymouth Caravelle grille in 1986–1988) offered from 1983 to 1988 with available turbocharger (&quot;TurboChrysler&quot; engine) from 1984 on. Four engines were offered for the Mexican Dodge Magnum K: a 2.2 L SOHC I-4 (K-Trans-4, 1983–86), a turbocharged 2.2 L SOHC I-4 (1984–86) and two 2.5 L SOHC I-4s, with and without turbocharger (1987–88).

When it was introduced, the Mexican Dodge Magnum 400 Turbo was advertised as &quot;Mexico&#x27;s fastest car&quot; in the TV commercials of the time, and it surely was in 1985, when the &quot;Fox&quot; (1979–84) 5.0 L Mexican Ford Mustang was dropped from the catalog of Ford Mexico. The Mexican front-wheel drive Magnum was officially called &quot;Dodge Magnum 400&quot; between 1983 and 1984, as it was a sporty Mexican variation of the American Dodge 400 of the early eighties (without the vinyl roof of the US version and with high output 2.2 L engine (available turbocharger from 1984 on), heavy-duty suspension, sporty wheels, tires, dash, steering wheel, console, shifter and seats). In 1984, the Mexican Magnum 400 Turbo was the closest thing to an American Dodge Daytona Turbo south of the border. For 1985, the &quot;400&quot; suffix was dropped. For the 1987 season, the turbocharger received an intercooler and the power from the turbo engine changed from 140 to . The K-car based Magnum was replaced by the Mexican Chrysler Shadow GTS for the 1989 model year.
==Chrysler LX platform (2005–2008)==
=== US and Canada ===

The Magnum name was revived in 2004 for the 2005 model year, as a station wagon based on the Chrysler LX platform. The Magnum had four engine options; the &quot;SE&quot; features the 190 hp 2.72 L LH V6, the &quot;SXT&quot; had the 3.5 L V6, and the &quot;RT&quot; had the new 340 hp 5.7 L Hemi V8. The SRT-8 has a 425 hp 6.1 L Hemi engine. All-wheel drive became an option in 2005 on SXT and RT models. The SRT8, AWD SXT, and the RT use a Mercedes-Benz-derived 5-speed automatic transmission, while all other models use a four-speed automatic.
The Magnum was built at the Brampton Assembly Plant, near Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from 2004 to the end of model year 2008.

The Dodge Magnum is based on the rear-wheel-drive Chrysler LX platform with Chrysler executives confirming that structural elements of the car&#x27;s foundation such as the toe board, safety cage architecture, as well as the load-path philosophy being utilized by then-partner, Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes executives also confirmed that several individual components of the car are derived from the Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W211) and S-Class of the era. Shared and or derived components from Mercedes-Benz included: the rear suspension cradle and 5-link independent rear suspension design derived from E-Class, a double-wishbone front suspension design with short-and-long arm front suspension geometry derived from the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220), the 5-Speed NAG1 W5A580 transmission (SRT8, AWD SXT, and the RT), rear differential, driveshaft, ESP &amp; ABS systems, steering system, the CAN Bus electrical architecture, cabin electronics including several other electronic modules, switchgear such as the cruise control and turn signal combination stalk, seat controls, seat frames, and the wiring harness. Later models also feature a Mercedes-Benz-derived laser key ignition system in place of the traditional metal key. AWD models also benefited from the use of Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s 4MATIC system, including transfer case components.

The Magnum was on &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; Ten Best list for 2005.

===SRT-8===

A higher performance SRT-8 version debuted at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show. The SRT-8 was based on a concept car that was displayed at the 2003 Los Angeles Auto Show. It went on sale in 2005 as a 2006 model. Like the 300C SRT-8, it featured the new Hemi engine, which produced 425 hp (317 kW). 20-inch wheels, firmer suspension, bigger Brembo brakes, new lower-body treatment, and a revised front and rear-fascia completes the transformation. The SRT-8 was named &quot;Best New Modern Muscle Car&quot; in the 2006 Canadian Car of the Year contest.
&quot;Motor Trend&quot; Test Results:
*0-60 mph: 5.1 seconds
*0-100 mph: 11.7 seconds
*Standing 1/4-mile: 13.1 sec at 
2007 and 2008 also saw the addition of the R/T &quot;Red Badge&quot; &quot;29R&quot; Road and Track package, which featured all of the SRT-8 options except the 6.1 Hemi engine and Brembo brakes.

=== Safety ===
NHTSA crash test ratings (2006):

* Rollover Rating: 

=== Europe and Australia ===
In Europe and Australia, the Magnum was sold as the Chrysler 300 Touring. It was essentially the same as the U.S.-market Magnum, but with the Chrysler 300C&#x27;s front end and interior, and right-hand-drive for Australia and the U.K. The 300C Touring added an available 3.0 L CRD Turbo Diesel version. The 300C Touring was assembled in Austria.

===2008 changes===
For the 2008 model year, the Magnum received a facelift as well as an updated interior in line with that of the Dodge Charger. The front fascia sported new aggressively squared off headlights and a smaller rectangular grille more reminiscent of the Charger. The Magnum SE, SXT, And RT models received two all new colors for the 2008 model year; Mineral Gray, and Light Sandstone. The SRT-8 variant gained a new hood scoop, more aggressive front fascia, a smaller, honeycomb mesh grille, and larger lower grille with brake cooling ducts. New colors such as TorRed and Steel Blue Metallic, originally introduced in 2007, were carried over to the face lifted 2008 SRT-8 Magnums as well as other trim levels. These new changes brought the car closer to its Charger platform mate, away from the Chrysler 300.

==Cancellation==
On November 1, 2007, Chrysler announced that, as part of its restructuring plans, the Dodge Magnum would be one of four models discontinued after the 2008 model year. In Chrysler&#x27;s words: &quot;The Magnum, along with the PT Cruiser convertible, the Crossfire, and the Pacifica were not earning their keep&quot;. Production ended on September 28, 2008. The Dodge Magnum (along with the short-wheelbase Dodge Caravan) has been replaced by the Dodge Journey.

=== Total U.S. sales ===

==Front end conversion==
A popular modification has been to change the front fascia of the Magnum to that of the 2005-2010 Chrysler 300; the commonality of parts and design of the LX cars means such a swap requires little to no custom fabrication. It&#x27;s also possible to swap on the Charger&#x27;s front fascia, but doing so is generally a more involved process. While the Magnum front fascia can be swapped with that of the Dodge Challenger, it is not a direct bolt-on swap, despite the cars sharing the same platform.

<doc id="952537" wikidata="Q1157614" url="?curid=952537" title="Chrysler LX platform">
<text>The LX platform was Chrysler&#x27;s full-size rear wheel drive automobile platform introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The LX was developed in North America to supersede the previous Chrysler LH platform, which had been designed to allow it to be easily upgraded to rear and all-wheel drive. The LD Charger, 300 and LA Challenger cars are built at Brampton Assembly in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. The European variant and all RHD models were built in Graz, Austria, by Magna Steyr from June 2005 until 2010, where they carried the platform designation of LE.

==LX==
Vehicles using the LX platform include:
* 2005–2010 Chrysler 300 sedan, station wagon (LE Only)
* 2005–2008 Dodge Magnum station wagon
* 2006–2010 Dodge Charger sedan

Concept vehicles using this platform include:
* Chrysler Nassau sedan
* Chrysler Airflite sedan

==LC==
The LC platform is a shortened LX platform designed for the Challenger.

Vehicles using the LC/LA platform include:

* 2008–2014, LC
* 2015–2023, LA
Dodge Challenger coupe

Concept vehicles using this platform include:
* Chrysler 200C EV sedan

== LD ==
The LD platform was introduced in 2011 for the second generation of the Charger. It is an entirely redesigned and updated platform but is closely related to the original LX.

Vehicles using the LD platform include:

* 2011–2023 Dodge Charger
* 2011–2023 Chrysler 300
* 2012–2015 Lancia Thema sedan

==LA==
The LA platform code has been used for the updated Dodge Challenger beginning in the 2015 model year. It was created primarily to allow the Challenger to use an eight speed automatic transmission.
* 2015–2023 Dodge Challenger coupe

==LY==
The LY platform is a lengthened LX platform used for:
* 2006 Chrysler Imperial sedan concept car

==Future LB Platform==

In June 2018, former FCA CEO, Sergio Marchionne stated that Dodge Challenger and Charger will retain the current LD platform which will be heavily revised for the next generation. Many thoughts suggesting the current LD Platform cars would hit the Giorgio platform, however this was later debunked by Marchionne stating that the Giorgio is more suited towards sports oriented European vehicles instead of American muscle cars. 

Upon the Merger with PSA with FCA, an evolution of Giorgio Architecture was developed while executing platform consolidation now named the STLA large. This Architecture already under the WLs and will eventually support KM, EJ, C6X, RU and RV along with all large segment cars for Europe, Maserati and Alfa. The Architecture will support multifuel BEV, PHEV, and ICE. The replacement in North America will be the LB29 for 2 Door possibly named Challenger and or Daytona, and LB49 4 Door Charger.

<text>A maritime emergency refers to any critical situation at sea where a vessel or its crew faces immediate distress, such as mechanical failure, fire, severe weather, medical emergencies, or collisions. These emergencies can trigger rescue operations involving specialized maritime safety measures and coordination between various maritime organizations.

Modern maritime emergency response include rapid alert systems like the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System GMDSS, which enables vessels to send distress signals and receive assistance. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) Convention set the framework for coordinated rescue operations, ensuring that distress situations are managed efficiently and that vessels provide assistance to those in need.

<text>W. T. Grant or Grants was a United States–based chain of mass-merchandise stores founded by William Thomas Grant that operated from 1906 until 1976. The stores were generally of the variety store format located in downtowns.

==History==
In 1906 the first &quot;W. T. Grant Co. 25 Cent Store&quot; (equal to $ today) opened in Lynn, Massachusetts. Modest profit, coupled with a fast turnover of inventory, caused the stores to grow to almost $100 million (~$ in ) annual sales by 1936, the same year that William Thomas Grant started the W. T. Grant Foundation. By the time Grant died in 1972 at age 96, his chain of W. T. Grant Stores had grown to almost 1,200. At the company&#x27;s end, headquarters were atop One Astor Plaza, a prominent building of New York City&#x27;s skyline on Times Square.

Like many national chain stores and some larger department stores, Grant arranged for a low price exclusive record label, Diva. Columbia Records produced this label which consisted of titles also issued on Columbia&#x27;s general sale Harmony label and it existed from 1925 through 1930. Based on the number of copies found, it appeared to be a good selling label. Grant continued to sell records after 1930, but they no longer had their own label.

Grant&#x27;s store-branded electronics and other goods were named &quot;Bradford&quot; after Bradford County, Pennsylvania, where William Thomas Grant was born. The in-store restaurants were named &quot;Bradford House&quot;, and their mascot was a pilgrim named &quot;Bucky Bradford&quot;. An alternative restaurant format, The Skillet, was used for in-store lunch counters.

The largest W. T. Grant store was located in Vails Gate, New York. It became a Caldor and several other stores, and later a Kmart, which closed in November 2017. 
 They also tried to convert existing stores to discount stores under the &quot;Diskay&quot; brand.
Canadian retailer Zellers concluded a deal with the W. T. Grant Company. The Grant Company was allowed to purchase 10% of Zellers common shares, and was given options that eventually translated into a 51% effective ownership of Zellers in 1959. In return for this, the &quot;Grant Company [was] making available to Zellers its experience on matters of merchandise, real estate, store development, and general administration&quot;. Zellers employees were sent to Grant stores and head office for training and together they made common buying trips to Asia, a practice that benefited both companies. By 1976, the Grant Company withdrew from Zellers.

=== Downfall and closure ===

Grant&#x27;s stores were slower than the Kresge stores to adapt to the growth of the suburb and the change in shopping habits that this entailed. The attempt to correct this was belated; in the 1960s and early 1970s, the company built many larger stores (later known as &quot;Grant City&quot;), but unlike Kresge&#x27;s Kmart they lacked uniform size and layout, so that a shopper familiar with one did not immediately feel &quot;at home&quot; in another. Grants&#x27; delay in building out its network of larger stores afforded rivals an opportunity to secure the most desirable building sites, leaving Grants with less preferable locations, often with inadequate selling space. After the company began to lose money, funds were borrowed to pay the quarterly dividend until this became impossible. A final tactic to stay in business involved requiring Grant&#x27;s clerks and cashiers to offer a Grant&#x27;s credit card application to customers to boost sales in the stores.

W. T. Grant&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1976 which was the then-second biggest in US history, was in part due to a failure to adapt to changing times but was probably accelerated by management&#x27;s refusal until it was too late to eliminate the shareholder dividend. While there is some argument over exactly which combination of decisions caused this, all these decisions were made by an unchecked management layer and the bankruptcy is considered the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; of the idea that US company directors had complete control over their company and no obligation to the company&#x27;s shareholders to make &#x27;the best&#x27; decisions to maintain the company value and survival.

The most apparent cause of the bankruptcy was the company&#x27;s decision to extend store credit to all customers, with no attempt made to assess the customer&#x27;s ability to repay. Each of the company&#x27;s stores had credit managers who authorized the opening of store credit accounts, which resulted in many customers having credit accounts with more than one of the company&#x27;s stores. In addition, there existed no centralized control or record-keeping of store credit accounts which resulted in noncollectable accounts. The credit was recovered in 1976 by Irwin Jacobs who, with the backing of Carl Pohlad, purchased their consumer accounts receivable account of $276.3 million for $44 million and 5% of first-year sales.

This initiative to extend credit to all customers was made in 1969, during a prosperous period in US history, when Grant was expanding into new areas of the US. W. T. Grant hoped to attract customers from rival Kresge and other department stores. The low number of defaults on small loans at this time meant that the credit arrangements seemed a good idea, but the absence of any credit check, and the low minimum repayment terms were extreme, even for the times. When the economic expansion slowed in 1970/1971 the balance shifted and the credit arrangement became more of a liability than an asset. No decision was made to change or halt this before 1974, by which time the company&#x27;s collapse was a certainty.

<text>Legacy of Kain is a series of dark fantasy action-adventure video games primarily developed by Crystal Dynamics and formerly published by Eidos Interactive. The first title, &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot;, was created by Silicon Knights in association with Crystal Dynamics, but, after a legal battle, Crystal Dynamics retained the rights to the game&#x27;s intellectual property, and continued its story with four sequels. To date, five games comprise the series, all initially developed for video game consoles and later ported to Microsoft Windows. Focusing on the eponymous character of Kain, a vampire antihero, each title features action, exploration and puzzle-solving, with some role-playing game elements.

The series takes place in the fictional land of Nosgoth—a gothic fantasy setting—and revolves around Kain&#x27;s quest to defy his fate and restore balance to the world. &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot; introduced another antihero protagonist, Raziel; the adventures of both characters culminate in &quot;Legacy of Kain: Defiance&quot;. Themes of destiny, free will, morality, redemption and the hero&#x27;s journey recur in the storyline, which was inspired by ancient literature, horror fiction, Islamic art and culture, Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, Jewish mysticism and gnosticism. The &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; games have enjoyed critical success, particularly receiving praise for high-quality voice acting, narrative, and visuals, and, as a whole, had sold over 3.5 million copies by 2007. In 2022, Square Enix sold the rights of the series to the Embracer Group, who have expressed interest in developing sequels, remakes and remasters of &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot;.

Remastered versions of &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; were released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2024.

==Games==

Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain was created by Silicon Knights under the direction of Denis Dyack, with assistance from publisher Crystal Dynamics, and was released in 1996 on the PlayStation. In 1997, it was ported to Microsoft Windows. Dyack conceived the &quot;vampire project&quot; under the title &quot;The Pillars of Nosgoth&quot; in 1993, and Crystal Dynamics producer Lyle Hall chose this fantasy concept over two other proposals (one of which was &quot;Too Human&quot;). Pursued in hopes of bringing a strong narrative and artistic cinema to consoles, it was built as &quot;a game which adults would want to play&quot;, featuring an unconventional hero and gameplay that demanded thought as well as reflexes. Developed as a 2D action-adventure game with role-playing game elements, it debuted to positive critical and commercial reception. Selling points included its 50+ hour length and the wide array of items and abilities the player character commands. &quot;Blood Omen&quot; introduces Nosgoth, a fictional land designed with novel-like complexity, and gives the player control of Kain, a newly resurrected vampire seeking revenge against his murderers and a cure for his vampiric curse.

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was released in 1999 for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, and was ported to the Dreamcast in 2000. It originated as an independent concept inspired by Biblical themes called &quot;Shifter&quot;, devised by Crystal Dynamics&#x27; Amy Hennig and Seth Carus, but, at the request of company executives, was integrated into the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; universe in pre-production. Hennig, the game&#x27;s director, likened the technological advance from &quot;Blood Omen&quot; to &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; to the evolution of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series from the Super Nintendo to the Nintendo 64—bringing the franchise into 3D while maintaining a similar style. &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; was hailed as a technical achievement for its plane-shifting gameplay mechanics and its data-streaming game engine, which eliminated the loading pauses that were prevalent in PlayStation-era games. It was a commercial and critical success, selling 1.5 million units worldwide, but the strong reactions of players to its cliffhanger ending impelled the developers to allay concerns that it was released unfinished. The game elaborates on one of the two endings to &quot;Blood Omen&quot;, taking place in Nosgoth&#x27;s dark future where Kain rules an empire of vampires, and introduces a new protagonist, his lieutenant Raziel, who is executed by Kain and resurrected to exact revenge on his brethren and his master.

Soul Reaver 2 had an accelerated development cycle and was released after two years, despite a switch to sixth generation consoles early in the project. It was initially targeted for release in late 2000 on the PlayStation and Dreamcast, but was reworked and released in 2001 as a PlayStation 2 exclusive, and was ported to Microsoft Windows later that year. The developers&#x27; goal was to retain the elements that made its predecessor successful, but they decided to eschew the &quot;complete a level, fight a boss&quot; flow of the previous game in favor of a more narrative-driven approach. The plot serves as a direct sequel to &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;, picking up immediately after its ending. The player controls Raziel as he uncovers the mysteries surrounding Nosgoth&#x27;s distant past and his own destiny. Meanwhile, Kain attempts to subvert fate and restore the world by manipulating history. While &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; was still in development, Crystal Dynamics initiated another project - a successor to &quot;Blood Omen&quot; - and when the &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; team had started work on their follow-up in late 1999, two &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; games were in simultaneous development.

Blood Omen 2&#x27;s &quot;creative seeds were sown&quot; in 1999, and the finished product was released in 2002, six months after &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Microsoft Windows and GameCube. It was not produced with the involvement of the &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; crew, instead being created by a new team at Crystal Dynamics under the direction of Glen Schofield. A key point of focus for the developers was the main character, Kain; Crystal Dynamics had &quot;a huge investment in Kain as a character&quot;. Shifting the focus of gameplay towards action, gore and combat instead of puzzle-solving, it retains several of the qualities which made the previous games popular, but was criticized for lacking innovation. Despite middling critical reception, it was released on four platforms and sold well. The setting, an enormous industrial city, is a departure for the series. While the game was released after &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, the events of the game actually happen after &quot;Blood Omen&quot; but before the events of &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;, in an alternate timeline created from the &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; events. In &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; players control a younger Kain after an unsuccessful campaign to conquer Nosgoth, as he is opposed by traitorous vampires and a new enemy.

Legacy of Kain: Defiance, the most recent entry in the series, was released in 2003 on the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. First conceptualized as &quot;Soul Reaver 3&quot;, it represented a combined effort from the &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; and &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; teams to consolidate and re-balance the storytelling, puzzle-solving and combat aspects of its predecessors, fusing elements from the two sub-series into one game. They chose a new title under the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; banner to reflect this new focus. The player alternates between control of Raziel and the &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; incarnation of Kain in each of the game&#x27;s chapters, under the premise that only one of the two will survive—emphasis was placed on cinematic presentation. The story concludes on a hopeful note, but without full resolution; during production, Hennig departed Crystal Dynamics to work for Naughty Dog, and &quot;Defiance&quot; did not meet Eidos&#x27; sales expectations. Following its release, Eidos placed the series on hold. Former Eidos North America CEO Bill Gardner and Eidos Life President Ian Livingstone expressed interest in reviving the franchise, but Crystal Dynamics stated that they were not working on a continuation.

Nosgoth, a multiplayer game, was formally announced by Square Enix London Studios community manager George Kelion to be in development in June 2013, in response to a series of internet leaks and resultant speculation. According to Kelion, it was to be set in the same universe as previous &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; titles, but would not be &quot;a traditional or even single-player LoK experience&quot;. The game was intended to be viewed as &quot;very much on a separate branch to both the &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Blood Omen&quot; series&quot;, and Crystal Dynamics were not involved in its development. Kelion stated that &quot;Nosgoth&quot; would be more formally announced and revealed at a future date, sometime beyond the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013. &quot;Nosgoth&quot; however was never officially released, but began open beta in January 2015. The game officially shut down its servers on May 31, 2016.

=== &quot;Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered&quot; ===

&quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered&quot; is a video game compilation released in 2024, developed and published by Aspyr that comprises the second and third games in the series. The remastered collection includes new features such as toggleable high-fidelity graphics, a modern control scheme, improved camera controls, a map and compass, &quot;lost levels&quot;, a photo mode, and a day and night cycle which was cut from the original &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;. The release of &quot;Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered&quot; coincides with the 25th anniversary of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot;. The game follows a development philosophy similar to that of Aspyr&#x27;s &quot;Tomb Raider I-III Remastered&quot;, and builds upon the games&#x27; original source code and engine, provided to the team by Crystal Dynamics.

==Overview==
===Common elements===
The &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; games fall into the action-adventure genre, utilizing a balance of action, puzzle-solving and exploration. Starting from &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;, the series also features platforming elements from a 3D, third-person perspective. Whereas &quot;Blood Omen&quot; and &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; employ an open world system in the style of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; or &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, the latter three games are divided into chapters, and are more linear in progression. As the player solves pivotal puzzles or defeats bosses, they receive new weapons and abilities, such as telekinesis, shapeshifting, mind control and magical spells. The main character&#x27;s health constantly declines in each game—Kain must consume blood to sustain his strength, whereas Raziel requires souls—prompting combat, which focuses on hack and slash techniques, and allows the player to kill and feed from enemies.

&quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; and &quot;Defiance&quot; include experience point systems, and in the &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; games and &quot;Defiance&quot;, the player must shift between the material and spectral planes of existence to progress – both realms have unique physical laws, geometry and enemies. The Soul Reaver sword, a recurring ultimate weapon and soul-devouring blade inhabited by a ravenous entity, appears in all five titles. Dialogue in the series is florid and Elizabethan in style, inspired by period pieces such as &quot;Becket&quot;, &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, and each game was scripted in the manner of a stage play, with monologues, asides and cutscenes interspersing gameplay. During &quot;Blood Omen&quot;″s production, Silicon Knights hired classically trained actors to deliver voice talent, a precedent which Crystal Dynamics continued in successive games.

Simon Templeman and Michael Bell voice protagonists Kain and Raziel respectively. Supporting cast members include Paul Lukather as Vorador, Anna Gunn as Ariel, Richard Doyle as Moebius, and René Auberjonois as Janos Audron. Tony Jay played Mortanius in &quot;Blood Omen&quot;, and returned as The Elder God in subsequent games; in &quot;Defiance&quot;, Mortanius was recast as Alastair Duncan. Gordon Hunt and Kris Zimmerman provided voice direction from &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and onward. The developers coordinated the actors by ensuring they were involved as collaborators, recording their dialogue together rather than in isolation, and thus established techniques which would later carry over to Naughty Dog&#x27;s &quot;Uncharted&quot; series.

===Story===

The health of the land of Nosgoth is inextricably tied to nine edifices known as the Pillars of Nosgoth. The Pillars are preserved by an oligarchy of sorcerers known as the Circle of Nine, each of whom serves as the guardian of an individual Pillar. When a guardian dies, a new one is born to take their place. In the prologue of &quot;Blood Omen&quot;, Ariel, the guardian of balance, is killed, and the resulting chain of events leads to the spiritual corruption of the Pillars and their guardians. Thirty years later, Kain, a young nobleman, is murdered by brigands, and resurrected as a vampire by a necromancer, Mortanius. Directed by Mortanius and the specter of Ariel, he tracks down and kills the guardians in hopes of attaining revenge and a cure to his vampirism, but slowly begins to embrace his new powers. While hunting Moebius, the guardian of time, he defies the advice of Vorador (a senior vampire), and travels back in time. Using the Soul Reaver, he prevents a tyrant king from coming to power, but the temporal paradox which this causes results in a new timeline where Nosgoth&#x27;s humans have hunted the vampires to extinction. Kain discovers that Mortanius — the guardian of death —orchestrated his murder to purge the Circle and kills all but one of the remaining guardians. Kain realizes that he himself is the final corrupt guardian, born as Ariel&#x27;s successor, and is left to decide between sacrificing himself to restore the world (but destroying the vampire race), or ruling Nosgoth in its damnation. &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; establishes that Kain, disgusted by the humans&#x27; machinations, chose the latter option and embraced vampirism as a blessing. He raised a cadre of vampire lieutenants to conquer Nosgoth&#x27;s human kingdoms, establishing an all-powerful empire under his control while the land decays.

1500 years after the events of &quot;Blood Omen&quot;, Raziel, his first-born follower, transgresses against Kain, and is consequently executed. A demiurge-like entity known as The Elder God resurrects Raziel, who quickly confronts Kain. Kain strikes Raziel with the Reaver, but it shatters against him, and the captive spirit formerly within the blade binds itself to Raziel&#x27;s arm. Raziel murders his lieutenant brethren, and discovers that Kain resurrected them all from the corpses of the Sarafan, an ancient vampire-hunting spiritual brotherhood. Infuriated at this revelation, he pursues Kain to Moebius&#x27;s long-abandoned time machine, and Kain lures him into the past. In &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, Raziel conspires with Moebius to destroy Kain, but—after realizing that Kain wishes to restore the Pillars, and learning that Moebius secretly serves The Elder God—his lust for vengeance is tempered by a higher quest for enlightenment and freedom from the ensnarement of predestination. On advice from Vorador, he seeks Janos Audron, an infamous, long-dead vampire who holds the key to his destiny. Raziel assists Kain in triggering another paradox which changes Kain&#x27;s fate, prolonging his life, and travels Nosgoth&#x27;s history. Beginning to unearth the secrets of his past, he briefly meets with Janos in the era of the Sarafan, but realizes that his own, human former self murdered the ancient vampire. He slaughters the Sarafan lieutenants, and murders his former self, becoming the catalyst of Kain&#x27;s future empire and his own history. In a final epiphany, he discovers that he is the ravenous spirit destined to become imprisoned in the Reaver—that the cycle of his destiny will never end. At the last minute, Kain saves Raziel from this fate and takes the empty Reaver, but the paradox that this causes changes history for the worse.

&quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; and &quot;Defiance&quot; expand the backstory of the series. Initially, alongside the humans, two other major races existed in Nosgoth&#x27;s distant past: the ancient vampires and the Hylden. The Vampires exalted the spiritual and the wheel of fate, whereas the Hylden were technologically inclined beings. Though the vampires worshiped The Elder God, the Hylden rejected his doctrine, and the vampires declared war in response to this blasphemy. Using incredible magic, the vampires erected the Pillars, banishing the Hylden into another dimension, and forged the Reaver as a safeguard. The Hylden retaliated by afflicting the vampires with a blood curse, which transformed them into immortal, sterile predators of humankind. Divorced from the wheel of fate and their god, many vampires turned to suicide, and as their race died out, the humans of Nosgoth seized control of the Pillars. Over the centuries, the Hylden strained against the barriers of their prison, seeking to topple the Pillars. Kain&#x27;s spiritual corruption hinders him from realizing his role as the balance guardian—he seeks to somehow resolve the dilemma he faced at the end of &quot;Blood Omen&quot; by both restoring the Pillars and returning them to vampire rule. Raziel&#x27;s execution was necessitated—his unique, cyclic destiny affords him free will, enabling Kain to create paradoxes and defy history. &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; pursues a younger Kain in the altered timeline created at the end of &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, depicting his war against the leader of the Hylden. Eventually, Kain kills The Hylden Lord, and departs, to eventually establish his empire from &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;.

&quot;Defiance&quot; covers earlier points in the same timeline, directly after &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;. Kain and Raziel each discover evidence that the ancient vampires and Hylden had prophesied two champions—one representing each race—who would decide the fate of Nosgoth. Whereas Raziel is bent on resurrecting Janos to escape his destiny, Kain strives to stop him, and the two are drawn into battle. Raziel learns from Mortanius that Kain was raised using Janos&#x27; heart, and rips this from Kain&#x27;s chest in their last battle, ostensibly killing his former master. Though disillusioned, Raziel resurrects Janos, who guides him to a final trial. Though he succeeds, receiving spiritual powers, Raziel witnesses the collapse of the Pillars. The resulting breach enables The Hylden Lord to possess Janos (facilitating his invasion in &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot;), and Raziel is defeated in the ensuing battle, trapped by The Elder God. He concludes that the Elder, sustained by the souls of Nosgoth, is the ultimate cause of all the conflict and strife throughout history, and realizes that he, himself, was both the Vampiric and Hylden champions; Kain was neither. His free will, and his destiny to enter the Reaver (consuming himself), ensures that neither champion can win. Later, Kain miraculously awakes, despite the loss of his heart. He encounters Raziel, and they reconcile; Raziel enters the Reaver willingly, but first uses his spiritual powers to cleanse Kain of the corruption he had inherited at birth as a member of the Circle of Nine. Thus healed, Kain is able to perceive The Elder God for the first time. They skirmish briefly, and Kain wounds the Elder with the Reaver, but is unable to destroy him. As he looks out over Nosgoth, Kain contemplates Raziel&#x27;s sacrifice, and the first bitter taste of hope it has given him.

===Themes===
Each of the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; games concerns distinct themes and dilemmas, but their overarching philosophical topic involves fatalism and man&#x27;s struggle for free will. &quot;Blood Omen&quot; was intended to ask &quot;what is evil? Perhaps it is merely a perspective&quot;, and to &quot;address morals, evil and good, propaganda and fate in ways that have never been explored in a computer game before&quot;. Other latent issues included trust, manipulation and betrayal, which carried over into Crystal Dynamics&#x27; sequels. In &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, Amy Hennig identified &quot;the question of free will in a universe apparently ruled by fate&quot; as the core of the story. Gnosticism, in which &quot;the material world is an illusion, a lie perpetrated by a false and malignant god whose aim is to keep the human soul in darkness and ignorance&quot; and the hero&#x27;s goal is &quot;knowledge, enlightenment, and the exposure of the truth&quot;, helped to formulate Raziel&#x27;s arc. Themes of despair, hope and illumination in the works of T. S. Eliot and James Joyce influenced the story.

The developers also attempted to subvert the monomyth and other tropes within literature and gaming. Silicon Knights conceptualized Kain, a vampire antihero inspired by Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, as an atypical &quot;gray&quot; protagonist, neither good nor evil, despite being advised in 1993 that such a character would not appeal to gamers. Similarly, Hennig developed Raziel as a &quot;self-righteous little twit&quot; with villainy, seeking redemption and transcendence through knowledge, in contrast to an idealistic hero. Drawing from Joseph Campbell&#x27;s ideas, she felt it would be interesting to see how players interpret morality in this context, and argued that &quot;the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path. As long as he&#x27;s following a path laid out by someone else, ultimately he&#x27;s going to fail&quot;. &quot;Defiance&quot; portrayed Kain and Raziel as Sophoclean Oedipus-like figures, &quot;being railroaded by fate&quot;. Hennig said that &quot;they are heroes because they refuse to submit, even when all the odds are stacked against them&quot;.

==Development==

During and after the completion of &quot;Dark Legions&quot;, Silicon Knights spent several months working on the design of &quot;Blood Omen&quot; without a particular platform in mind. Major inspirations behind the project included &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;, &quot;Necroscope&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, while the concept of the Pillars of Nosgoth was derived from cover art for &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;. Crystal Dynamics agreed to publish the game in 1993, and although there was indecision as to whether it should be produced for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer or the Sega Saturn, both parties settled on the PlayStation once Sony announced its impending launch. The game took over three years to develop, undergoing a substantial expansion mid-process which required Silicon Knights to increase its workforce—Crystal Dynamics sent several staff to assist them, including Amy Hennig and Seth Carus. Following &quot;Herculean efforts&quot;, &quot;Blood Omen&quot; was released in late 1996. After its success, Silicon Knights contemplated creating a sequel in what they described as the &quot;Blood Omen&quot; series, but their relationship with Crystal Dynamics dissolved in 1997. Crystal Dynamics began developing &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; internally, and were acquired by Eidos Interactive during its production.

In 1998, Silicon Knights filed a suit against Crystal Dynamics for rights to the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; IP, requesting an injunction to prevent Crystal Dynamics from marketing the sequel. The two studios settled their legal dispute privately, and Crystal Dynamics and Eidos retained rights to the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; franchise, provided that &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; acknowledge Silicon Knights as the series&#x27; original creator. &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was the original inspiration behind the concept, and sources such as Rabbinic lore, vampire mythology, Eastern myth and mysticism were also key influences. Visual cues were borrowed from films such as &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; and &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;, and H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; was highly anticipated despite several delays, and was promoted on the covers of over ten game industry magazines, but schedule pressures forced Crystal Dynamics to cut content from the ending sequence. They intended to integrate the removed material into the sequel. &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; was inspired by time travel fiction and Kurt Rudolph&#x27;s research into Gnosticism. It was slated to include more of &quot;Blood Omen&quot;″s role-playing game aspects and a wider breadth of acquirable abilities, though the team was handicapped by the release of the PlayStation 2.

The &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; project was produced for the PlayStation for a short time, but, after creating a proof-of-concept demo, the developers were given approval to scrap their work and switch to the newer console. With &quot;remarkable dedication, and sickening hours&quot;, the game was developed in 17 months; as with &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;, several features were cut in order to meet the release deadline. &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; was concurrently developed by an independent Crystal Dynamics team with creative autonomy, extrapolating from the 19th century steampunk aesthetic of &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; to settle on a Victorian feel. Its crew was wary of relying too strongly on the original &quot;Blood Omen&quot; as an influence, and expanded on the franchise&#x27;s backstory in hopes of starting a new series, but inconsistencies raised by its plot left the &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; team to reconcile the storyline in the next game. &quot;Defiance&quot; represented &quot;a whole new approach&quot; to the franchise, with more focus on drama, an overhauled combat system, and scripted, cinematic camera angles.

In 2008, it emerged that a sixth game, &quot;Legacy of Kain: The Dark Prophecy&quot;, had briefly been in development at Ritual Entertainment in 2004 before being canceled. Later, in 2013, Square Enix confirmed allegations that Climax Studios had worked on another new &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; title, for the PlayStation 4—&quot;Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun&quot;—until this project&#x27;s cancellation in 2012.

==Other media==
Music from both &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001. For &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;, Amy Hennig selected Kurt Harland of synthpop band Information Society to compose the score. According to Harland, a colleague introduced the &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; team to his work through &quot;Ozar Midrashim&quot;, a track from Information Society&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot;. This track went on to feature in &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; as the opening theme. Harland worked with audio engineer Jim Hedges in the creation of an adaptive audio system for &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; which allowed the music to change based on in-game context. This approach became a mainstay of subsequent games in the series.

Following the release of &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;, action figures of the characters Kain and Raziel were created by Blue Box Interactive and the National Entertainment Collectibles Association in partnership with Eidos. A single-issue promotional comic by Top Cow Productions was released in October 1999 to promote the release of &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;, starring the vampire Raziel and serving as a prequel to the game&#x27;s events. Top Cow collaborated with Crystal Dynamics to produce a second comic in early 2004, recapitulating the series&#x27; backstory, to coincide with the release of &quot;Defiance&quot;. Both Kain and Raziel also feature as playable characters in downloadable content for 2010&#x27;s &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot;.

By June 2024, a graphic novel titled &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise&quot; was revealed to be in the works as a collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Bit Bot Media and is crowdfunded through Kickstarter. The graphic novel serves as a prequel to &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot; and flashes back to Raziel&#x27;s human past as a Sarafan warrior and reveals how he came to be a vampire serving under Kain. Later Bit Bot Media announced that Klayton of Celldweller is involved in the production.

==Reception==
By 2007, the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; series had collectively sold over 3.5 million copies, but its commercial success has varied with each game. &quot;Blood Omen&quot; surpassed Crystal Dynamics&#x27; expectations, with reported sales figures ranging from 320,082 units to 2 million copies, whereas &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; sold over 1.5 million copies, and was included on Sony&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; list. &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; and &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; also performed well, selling in excess of 500,000 copies each and becoming Greatest Hits titles. &quot;Defiance&quot; sold between 500,000 and 1 million units, but failed to live up to Eidos&#x27;s sales targets.

&quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; has been cited as one of the most popular video game intellectual properties associated with vampires. IGN&#x27;s Douglass C. Perry regarded the series as &quot;a strangely attractive, yet equally obscure one that [had him] torn between loving and hating it&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s Greg Kasavin was critical of &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot;, but praised the &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; games as &quot;great&quot; for their &quot;innovation and surprising drama&quot;, voice acting and technical feats. Matt Clemens of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; said that the series had engaging narrative, impressive cinematic sequences and fluid combat, calling &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; an &quot;absolute classic&quot;. The &quot;Houston Press&quot; described &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot;&#x27;s voice cast as &quot;the greatest unrecognized brilliance in video game acting&quot;, and compared the dialogue of the series to plays by William Shakespeare. Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar said that &quot;known for nuanced storytelling, unconventional protagonists, amazing boss fights and rich Shakespearean baritones, the series raised the bar for writing and acting in games&quot;. GameSpy&#x27;s Chuck Osborn complimented the games&#x27; storyline as &quot;deep&quot;, but described their mythology as convoluted.

Individually, each title has generally been received well by critics. Metacritic, a video game review aggregator website, determined that the PlayStation version of &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; received a &quot;critical acclaim&quot; score of 91/100, &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; scores of 80/100 and 77/100 for PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows, the Xbox version of &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; received a &quot;generally favorable&quot; score of 76/100 while the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows versions received &quot;mixed or average&quot; scores of 71/100, 67/100 and 66/100, and the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Defiance&quot; received a &quot;generally favorable&quot; score of 75/100 while the Xbox and Microsoft Windows versions received &quot;mixed or average&quot; scores of 74/100 and 70/100. &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; was also Amy Hennig&#x27;s self-proclaimed greatest achievement. Later games in the series were criticized for repetitive gameplay elements and review scores of subsequent titles trended downward.

== Legacy ==
In an October 2015 interview, Crystal Dynamics&#x27; senior designer, Michael Brinker, replied that there was &quot;a 50/50 chance&quot; of a sixth &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; single player game releasing during the eighth generation of video game consoles. The IP was also mentioned under Square Enix Collective. 

In May 2022, Embracer Group acquired the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; intellectual property alongside other assets of Square Enix Europe, including the development studio Crystal Dynamics for $300 million. Embracer Group expressed interest in sequels, remakes and remasters of the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; franchise among others. That November, Embracer, after sending a survey in October to gauge fan interest in the IP, said during an earnings call that they received more than 100,000 responses and hear the fans &quot;loud and clear&quot;. 

Two &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; collections were released in 2024: &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered&quot; in December for multiple platforms, and &quot;Legacy of Kain Collection&quot; for Evercade retro gaming device in September and includes &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot; and &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot;.

<doc id="952552" wikidata="Q21051525" url="?curid=952552" title="Dancing at Lughnasa">
<text>Dancing at Lughnasa is a 1990 play by dramatist Brian Friel set in County Donegal, Ireland in August 1936 in the fictional town of Ballybeg. It is a memory play told from the point of view of the adult Michael Evans, the narrator. He recounts the summer in his aunts&#x27; cottage when he was seven years old.

==Background==
This play is loosely based on the lives of Friel&#x27;s mother and aunts who lived in Glenties, a small town in the south-west of County Donegal. Set in the summer of 1936, the play depicts the late summer days when love briefly seems possible for five of the Mundy sisters (Maggie, Chris, Agnes, Rose, and Kate) and the family welcomes home the frail elder brother, Jack, who has returned from a life as a missionary in Africa. However, as the summer ends, the family foresees the sadness and economic privations under which they will suffer as all hopes fade.

The play takes place in early August, around the festival of Lughnasadh, the Celtic harvest festival. The play describes a bitter harvest for the Mundy sisters, a time of reaping what has been sown.

==Plot==
The five Mundy sisters (Kate, Maggie, Agnes, Rosie, and Christina), all unmarried, live in a cottage outside of Ballybeg. The oldest, Kate, is a school teacher, the only one with a well-paid job. Agnes and Rose knit gloves to be sold in town, thereby earning a little extra money for the household. They also help Maggie to keep house. Maggie and Christina (Michael&#x27;s mother) have no income at all. Michael is seven years old and plays in and around the cottage.

All the drama takes place in the sisters&#x27; cottage or in the yard just outside, with events from town and beyond being reported either as they happen or as reminiscence.

Recently returned home after 25 years is their brother Jack, a priest who has lived as a missionary in a leper colony in a remote village called Ryanga in Uganda. He is suffering from malaria and has trouble remembering many things, including the sisters&#x27; names and his English vocabulary. It becomes clear that he has &quot;&quot; and abandoned much of his Catholicism during his time there. This may be the real reason he has been sent home.

Gerry, Michael&#x27;s father, is Welsh. He is a charming yet unreliable man, always clowning. He is a travelling salesman who sells gramophones. He visits rarely and always unannounced. A radio nicknamed &quot;Marconi&quot;, which works only intermittently, brings 1930s dance and traditional Irish folk music into the home at rather random moments and then, equally randomly, ceases to play. This leads the women into sudden outbursts of wild dancing.

The poverty and financial insecurity of the sisters is a constant theme. So are their unfulfilled lives: none of the sisters has married, although it is clear that they have had suitors whom they fondly remember.

There is a tension between the strict and proper behaviour demanded by the Catholic Church, voiced most stridently by the upright Kate, and the unbridled emotional paganism of the local people in the &quot;back hills&quot; of Donegal and in the tribal people of Uganda.

There is a possibility that Gerry is serious this time about his marriage proposal to Christina. On this visit, he says he is going to join the International brigade to fight in the Spanish Civil War, not from any ideological commitment but because he wants adventure. There is a similar tension here between the &quot;godless&quot; forces he wants to join and the forces of Franco against which he will be fighting, which are supported by the Catholic Church.

The opening of a knitwear factory in the village has killed off the hand-knitted glove cottage industry that has been the livelihood of Agnes and Rose. The village priest has told Kate that there are insufficient pupils at the school for her to continue in her post in the coming school year in September. She suspects that the real reason is her brother Jack, whose heretical views have become known to the Church and have tainted her by association.

There is a sense that the close home life the women have known since childhood is about to be torn apart. The narrator, the adult Michael, tells us this is indeed what happens.

==Characters==
; Kate Mundy: Kate is the eldest of the Mundy sisters and behaves as a mother figure towards the others. As a schoolteacher, she is the only wage-earner in the house, but her reputation as &quot;The Gander&quot; in the schoolroom is seen to extend into the household. She is a fiercely devout Catholic, indicated by her distaste for the pagan practices at Lughnasa and Jack&#x27;s loss of faith. However, her sensitivity is evident throughout the play and through the narratives provided by Michael, who claims she was &quot;inconsolable&quot; when Father Jack died.

; Maggie Mundy: In place of a career, Maggie acts as the chief family homemaker. Throughout the play she is revealed as serving a deeper purpose as the &quot;joker&quot; of the family, defusing tensions as they arise. She cheekily challenges Kate&#x27;s authority by calling her &quot;Kitty&quot;, whilst being her confidant at the same time. Maggie is seen to have dreams of her own when she learns of her best friend&#x27;s success. Her sudden quiet contemplation in her monologue is deeply contrasted with her usual fun-loving way of speaking.

; Christina Mundy: At 26 years old, Chris is the youngest of the Mundy sisters, and, like Maggie, has no paid job. Gerry Evans fathered her son, Michael, seven years ago and is seen as walking in and out of their lives as he chooses. As a result, Chris fluctuates between falling into a deep depression when he leaves, yet being renewed with optimism that his next visit will be a permanent stay. Her lack of income can lead Chris to be defensive on the upbringing of her son, shown when Kate buys Michael a new spinning top at the beginning of the play.

; Rose Mundy: Rose is 32, but behaves much younger than her years, due to a developmental disability. This condition makes her particularly vulnerable to an unseen character, Danny Bradley, a married man, whom Rose believes is in love with her. However, her sisters believe that Bradley is exploiting Rose&#x27;s simple nature for his own gain. She is particularly close to her older sister, Agnes, with whom she knits gloves to sell in the town. We learn through Michael&#x27;s narrative that, after leaving home with Agnes, Rose eventually dies in a hospice for the destitute in Southwark, London, in the 1950s.

; Agnes Mundy: Agnes is quiet and contemplative, knitting gloves with Rose whilst also helping to keep the house in order, along with Maggie. She appears to be silently infatuated with Gerry and is quick to leap to his defence. However, Michael&#x27;s narratives reveal Agnes&#x27; future to be bleak. Her knitting fails to support her when the knitware factory opens. Due to her sense of parental regard for Rose, she emigrates with her to London, breaking off all contact with the family, and dies in dire circumstances in the 1950s.

; Michael Evans (main character): Michael does not appear onstage as a child, but his presence is alluded to by the other characters, while the adult Michael speaks his lines from the side of the stage. As a child, Michael is seen as being surrounded by love, since all five of the sisters dote on him. Michael also acts as a narrator, not only dictating the action as it goes on, but revealing the futures of the other characters in the play.

; Gerry Evans: Gerry is initially portrayed as an intensely negative character, particularly by Kate, for having left Chris after fathering her illegitimate son, Michael. However, upon his first appearance in the play, Gerry is shown to be charming and genuinely affectionate towards Chris. His current job as a gramophone salesman (like his former job as a ballroom dancing instructor) represents his freedom, in sharp contrast to the stagnant lives of the Mundy sisters. This is made all the more obvious by the fact that he is leaving Ireland to join the International Brigade and fight in the Spanish Civil War, something that is further disapproved of by Kate. Through Michael&#x27;s narration, we learn that Gerry is later left with a limp after falling off a motorbike in Barcelona. As well as having romantic feelings for Chris, Gerry seems particularly inclined towards Agnes, although the true state of their relationship remains in doubt. We learn later that he secretly has another family back in Wales, and that all his proposals of marriage to Christina have been false. Adult narrator Michael reveals that, after Gerry&#x27;s death in the 1950s, he had been contacted by a half brother in South Wales, who revealed that Gerry had had a wife and several sons there at the time depicted in the drama.

;Father Jack: Jack is in his late fifties. He had left home as a young man to work as a missionary in a leper colony in Uganda. Beyond this, he had been a Catholic chaplain in the British Army in East Africa during World War I. He is well respected in Donegal for his missionary work in a leper colony. However, his sudden return to Ballybeg for undisclosed reasons has paved the way for great changes. He has difficulty with his memory, often forgetting the names of his sisters or confusing them with his former house boy Okawa, with whom we are told he was very close. Jack professes a broad admiration for the pagan beliefs of the native people of Africa, and appears to have lost his Catholic faith, which may be the true reason his superiors have sent him back. This is a great worry for Kate, who is concerned about the family&#x27;s reputation. Jack refers to Michael as a love child rather than an illegitimate child and says they are common and accepted among the people of Uganda.

:In a scene near the close of the play he swaps his British colonial tricorn hat, a gift from a British governor, for a lesser hat worn by Gerry. Jack turns the swap into a non-catholic ceremony as well as referring to Uganda as his home. It is Gerry who is now to go abroad seeking adventure just as Jack settles back into his home country.

:Father Jack recovers from his malaria and confusion, but Michael as narrator tells us that he died of a heart attack soon after the events portrayed in the play.

<text>Kardinia Park (also known as GMHBA Stadium due to naming rights) is a sporting and entertainment venue located within Kardinia Park, South Geelong, in the Australian state of Victoria. The stadium, which is owned and operated by the Kardinia Park Stadium Trust, is the home ground of the Geelong Football Club, an Australian rules football club who compete in the Australian Football League (AFL). Kardinia Park can accommodate 40,000 spectators, making it the largest-capacity Australian stadium in a regional city, and the third largest-capacity stadium in Victoria behind the Melbourne Cricket Ground (100,024) and Docklands Stadium (56,347).

==Australian rules football==

===Early years===
Football has been played on Kardinia Park since the 19th century, and prior to the 1940s, Kardinia Park was the secondary football venue in the city of Geelong; Corio Oval was the primary venue, and the Geelong Football Club played its Victorian Football League games at that venue until 1940. Kardinia Park served as the home ground for the Geelong (A.) Football Club in the Victorian Football Association from 1922 until 1925, before that club moved to the Western Oval in Geelong West; local and district football was played regularly on the ground.

The Geelong Football Club began playing its home games at Kardinia Park in 1941 after Corio Oval was commandeered by the military during World War II, and it became its permanent home venue thereafter.

===Recent history===
On 23 May 2002, Kardinia Park hosted a visit from the Dalai Lama, who again visited the stadium in June 2007.

Kardinia Park is regarded as a proverbial graveyard for teams playing against Geelong, which has an especially good record at the ground. Geelong did not lose a single match played at the venue between 26 August 2007 and 27 August 2011. Geelong&#x27;s Jimmy Bartel credited the home-field advantage to the fact that Geelong is one of the few clubs which still practices on the same field that it plays on.

On 22 June 2011, it was announced the stadium would have a new name in 2012. After 10 years as naming rights sponsor of Skilled Stadium, Skilled Group decided to relinquish these rights as of 31 October 2011. Previous names of the stadium as results of sponsorship deals have been Skilled Stadium, Shell Stadium and Baytec Stadium; however it was only called Baytec Stadium for less than two months, and only one pre-season match was played there under the name. The stadium is nicknamed &quot;The Cattery&quot; by the club&#x27;s supporters.

On 30 July 2011, Geelong recorded its largest ever victory, and the second-largest victory in V/AFL history when it defeated by 186 points. The Cats&#x27; score of 37.11 (233) was their second-highest score in club history, and the highest ever score recorded at Kardinia Park.

Floodlights were installed prior to the 2013 AFL season, and the venue staged its first night match during the season.

On 7 September 2013, Kardinia Park hosted its first ever AFL Final, a qualifying final against Fremantle Dockers, with Geelong losing the game 87–72.

In its current layout Kardinia Park consists of the following seating areas: the Reg Hickey Stand, Players Stand, Premiership Stand, Brownlow Stand and the new Joel Selwood Stand, with the Gary Ablett Terrace standing room section located within the Selwood stand.

On 4 July 2021, the venue hosted its 689th V/AFL match, but its first ever AFL home and away fixture not involving Geelong, as Sydney Swans hosted West Coast Eagles due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales causing a lockdown in the Greater Sydney area. Sydney won 118–26 with the attendance posted of 9,520.

==Cricket==
In 2016, it was announced that international cricket would be played at the ground for the first time. The ground hosted second T20 International between Australia and Sri Lanka on 19 February. The ground witnessed memorable match between two nations, where Sri Lanka won the match by 2 wickets at the end. Sri Lanka chased 173 runs at the last ball of the match.

On 3 January 2018 the ground hosted a Women&#x27;s Big Bash League and Big Bash League double header with the Melbourne Renegades taking on the Sydney Sixers with the Renegades winning in both matches.

The ground was to be used in the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup. However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed to October 2021 with United Arab Emirates and Oman hosting instead of Australia who hosted the 2022 ICC T20 World Cup instead.

==Soccer==
In August 2019, it was announced that new A-League club Western United would play the majority of home matches at Kardinia Park for the upcoming 2019/20 season and for a further two or three years. The club had planned to play most home matches at Kardinia Park until moving into their proposed new stadium in Tarneit in Melbourne&#x27;s West. Their first game at the ground was a 1–1 draw with Perth Glory in front of 6,088 on 19 October 2019. Western United last played matches at Kardinia Park in December 2021.

Kardinia Park was included in the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, with a proposed upgrade to 44,000 seats analogous to the later proposed stage 5 of redevelopment, with the new multi tiered stand stretching all the way from the southern end, around the western side and the northern Ablett stand, however the bid lost out to Qatar.
After a seven-year gap between Melbourne Victory&#x27;s first match at the stadium, a 2007 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup match against Newcastle Jets and their second, a 2014 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off against Thai side Muangthong United, the ground hosted its first-ever A-League premiership match in 2015 when Victory played Perth Glory FC in round 14 of the 2014–15 A-League season with an attendance of 21,289 as the first match of a three-year deal to bring one Victory fixture per season to Geelong. The second match drew 14,268 fans to an exciting six-goal, come-from-behind draw by the Victory against Central Coast Mariners in January 2016, while the third was held on 2 January 2017 with Newcastle Jets as the visiting team, when a crowd of 14,081 witnessed Besart Berisha overtake Archie Thompson&#x27;s all-time A-League scoring record in a 4–2 win for the Victory. Victory and the stadium trust agreed to extend the deal by two more years in 2017.

European Champions League finalists Atlético Madrid played Melbourne Victory in a friendly match at the stadium on 31 July 2016. Melbourne Victory won 1–0.

The stadium has also played host to one full men&#x27;s international match on 30 December 2014, a pre-tournament friendly between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia prior to the 2015 AFC Asian Cup hosted by Australia, which ended as a 4–1 win for Bahrain.

The Australian women&#x27;s national team, the Matildas, won a friendly match against China 5–1 on 26 November 2017, attracting a crowd of 6,338 even with a thunderstorm which forced a delay to the match of half an hour.

==Other uses==
During the late 1920s and early 1930s when Motorcycle speedway was becoming popular throughout Australia, Kardinia Park was home to a dirt track speedway known as the Geelong Velodrome. The Velodrome hosted the inaugural Victorian Solo Speedway Championship in 1926/27 and followed up with the second championship held in 1927/28. Both championships were won by Billy Pilgrim.

On 4 March 2022, American band Foo Fighters performed at the venue marking the first stadium show in the country after the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.

==Redevelopments==

Over a twenty-year period between 2003 and 2023, Kardinia Park has undergone an extensive redevelopment of its grandstands, and spectator and interior facilities. A 28 million redevelopment of the stadium was announced in 2003, with A$13.5 million in funding from the Victorian Government, A$4.5 million from the Geelong Football Club, and A$2 million from the AFL. The redeveloped ground was opened on 1 May 2005 during the first home game of the 2005 season. It included a new western entry and membership area, as well as the five-level wing-side grandstand with a capacity of 6,098 spectators on the eastern side of the stadium.

A favourite for the honour of the naming of the new stand was Bob Davis, coach of the Cats&#x27; premiership side in 1963. On 15 June 2005, City of Greater Geelong councillors granted the club its wish to change the name of the new eastern stand to the Reg Hickey Stand, while the southern stand became the Doug Wade Stand. The northern terrace became known as the Gary Ablett Terrace while the western gate was renamed the Bob Davis Gate.

In September 2007, Kardinia Park received a further total of A$25 million towards the second stage of redevelopment in rebuilding the Ross Drew Stand on the south western side of the ground. Funding for the project included A$14 million from the federal government and A$6 million from the Victorian Government. The new stand, known as the 2009 Premiership Stand, features seating for 4,714 supporters, including up to 800 corporate guests on match days. The stand opened on 10 April 2010 and was officially unveiled in round four of the 2010 AFL season, coinciding with the unveiling of the 2009 premiership flag. A$50,000 was also spent on a new 600-seat temporary stand between the Reg Hickey and Doug Wade stands.

In May 2009 it was revealed that the stadium owners the City of Greater Geelong had approached a number of Melbourne-based AFL clubs discussing the financial advantages of playing home games at the ground. Though such a move never eventuated, the ground was capable of earning other clubs A$30 a patron, compared to the A$7 a patron earned at Docklands Stadium in Melbourne. The Geelong Football Club had first floated Skilled Stadium as a potential home game venue for Melbourne clubs in 2006.

In April 2011, plans for the third stage of redevelopment were revealed. Under the plans, the Doug Wade stand at the southern end of the stadium was pulled down at the end of the 2011 AFL season. The works included the demolition of the old Doug Wade stand and the construction of a new 9,340 seat Southern Grandstand. The new Grandstand also included improved spectator amenities, a purpose-built training facility for community sports and education groups, a &quot;past players&quot; function room, and four broadcast-compliant floodlit towers, allowing the stadium to host night events. The redevelopment saw the stadium increase in capacity to 33,500. The redevelopment cost $33 million, of which $11.7 million was spent on the new lighting.

Significant miscalculations were made with respect to the budget required for the stage 3 redevelopment and consequently several aspects of the original plans were scaled back by the Geelong Football Club in November 2011, including the removal of the proposed supporters lounge and decreasing capacity by 1,000 seats. The new grandstand was named the Players Stand in August 2012 and from 1 November 2011, the venue became known as Simonds Stadium, after homebuilding group Simonds Homes signed a five-year naming rights deal.

The new Players Stand was officially opened on 1 June 2013, prior to Geelong&#x27;s first proper home match of the 2013 AFL season against Gold Coast. The match was the first to be played under the new floodlights and was played in front of 30,082 fans, the largest crowd at the stadium at that time since the first stage of the re-development.

The fourth stage of redevelopment saw the Brownlow and the Jennings Stands demolished at the end of the 2015 AFL season to make way for a new state of the art grandstand. The new stand, eventually named the Charles Brownlow Stand (in honour of the club&#x27;s Brownlow Medal winners and Mr. Charles Brownlow) was opened on 18 May 2017. The new stand features seating for 6,500 people, improved media facilities, a new 1000-seat function centre, merchandise store, café, an enhanced football department and the &quot;Sunrise Centre&quot;, a community facility providing rehabilitation for people returning to the workforce following serious injury.

The total cost of the fourth stage of redevelopment was $91 million, of which $75m came from the Victorian Government, $6m from the City of Greater Geelong, $6 million from the Geelong Football Club and $4 million from the AFL. The total capacity of Kardinia Park after the stage 4 redevelopment was nominally 36,000; however, given the way the stadium is configured for AFL matches, its capacity was said to be unable to exceed 34,000.

During 2016 laws were passed by the Victorian Parliament for management of the stadium to be taken over by the government-appointed Kardinia Park Stadium Trust, in line with practices at other major venues in the state. Prior to this the venue had been owned and operated by the City of Greater Geelong, which now maintains and manages the broader Kardinia Park precinct, though not the actual stadium itself.

In April 2017, the Victorian Government announced an investment of $3.9 million in the upcoming state budget to fund the planning and design stage for Stage 5 of the redevelopment. This stage of redevelopment was the final part of the more than decade-long process to increase the capacity of Kardinia Park to 40,000 and resulted in the Ford Stand and Gary Ablett Terrace being removed to make way for a new grandstand to ring around the rest of the remaining open-air section of the stadium. In November 2020 the government revealed it had assigned $142 million to complete this final stage of redevelopment. The new grandstand holds 14,000 spectators and includes function rooms, administrative offices and broadcast studios, cricket warm-up facilities and standing room facilities for spectators. Construction on the project commenced in September 2021 following the conclusion of the AFL season. Due to the commencement of construction associated with Stage 5 of the stadium&#x27;s redevelopment, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was temporarily reduced to as low as 23,000 at times.

Despite being originally planned to be completed by mid-2023, the fifth stage of redevelopment was delayed to early 2024 due to defects with overseas-sourced steel. In November 2023, as the stand was nearing completion, the stadium trust announced that the stand would be named the Joel Selwood Stand, in recognition of former Geelong Football Club premiership captain Joel Selwood, who played 355 games with the club. The stand was completed shortly thereafter and was first used by spectators at a pre-season match between Geelong and on 1 March 2024. It was formally unveiled by the government and other parties at a press conference on 12 March 2024, a few days prior to the round 1 match between Geelong and .

The stadium currently contributes $3-4 million to the Geelong economy each Cats home game, and even more with the new redevelopment attracting events like the Foo Fighters, one of the world’s biggest rock bands, who performed before 30,000 fans at the stadium in 2022. The brand benefits for Geelong were enormous, with packed restaurants on Pako and Little Malop Street and hotels and Airbnbs booked out across the region. It wasn’t just travellers from Melbourne, as the City was buzzing with Foo Fighters fans from across Victoria and Australia, which was a sign that Geelong was going through a real renaissance.
The five stage redevelopment of the stadium, completed over two decades at a cost of $340 million, has given rise to the ground being given the nickname Pork Barrel Park, a reference to the practice of politicians spending money on local projects to win favour with voters. Although the stadium is in the safe federal Labor seat of Division of Corio, the neighbouring Division of Corangamite has been a marginal seat for close to two decades, leading to claims that the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia have both sought to win support from voters by continually upgrading the stadium. 

Since January 2018, the stadium has been commercially named GMHBA Stadium.

<text>Robert Frederick Bennett (May 23, 1927 – October 9, 2000) was an American lawyer and the 39th governor of Kansas from 1975 to 1979.

==Biography==
Bennett was born May 23, 1927, in Kansas City, Missouri. He married Joan Gregory, whom he met at Shawnee Mission Rural High School while participating in debate. They had four children: Robert F. (junior), Virginia L., Kathleen, and Patricia. He earned a B.A. in 1950 and a law degree in 1952 from the University of Kansas. He married a second time in 1971 to Olivia Fisher.

==Career==
Bennett served in the U.S. Marine Corps in China during World War II and he also served in the U. S. Marines again during the Korean War, was wounded and received a Purple Heart.

In 1952, Bennett began his own law firm with Robert Lytle. The firm continued for more than 40 years until it merged with Lathrop &amp; Gage in the mid-1990s. He was a council member from 1955 to 1957 in Prairie Village. From 1957 to 1965, Bennett served as mayor of Prairie Village, Kansas (a suburb of Kansas City).

A member of the Kansas State Senate from 1965 to 1975, Bennett was known for his classic cowboy boots, cowboy hat, and beard. He was an eloquent speaker and would often send reporters scrambling for dictionaries. He was president of the state senate when he was elected to the governorship in 1974. This was the first election that candidates for governor and lieutenant governor ran as a team as well as for a four-year term rather than a two-year term. During his tenure, he reformed operations in the governor&#x27;s office to make heads of state agencies more responsible to the governor. In 1978, he lost his re-election bid to John W. Carlin and returned to his own practice and home.

From 1982 to 1983, Bennett served as chair of the Kansas Republican Party.

==Death==
Bennett died October 9, 2000, of lung cancer at the St. Joseph&#x27;s Medical Center in Kansas City and was buried in Corinth Cemetery in Prairie Village, Kansas. An avid hunter and fisherman, he was also a member of the American Bar Association, the American Judicature Society, the Freemasons, and the Optimist Club.

<text>James Colebrooke Patterson, PC (1839 – February 17, 1929) was a Canadian politician. He served as a federal cabinet minister from 1892 to 1895 and as the sixth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1895 to 1900.

==Early life==
Patterson was born to a Protestant family in Armagh, Ireland, and was educated at Dublin. He moved to Canada in 1857 and entered the civil service, though he later resigned. He subsequently trained in law and was called to the bar in 1876.

==Political career==
Patterson settled in the Windsor area and held a number of local offices (including a ten-year term as reeve of Windsor). In 1875, he was elected to the Ontario legislature as a Conservative, defeating independent candidate L. Montreuil by 1209 votes to 755 in the riding of Essex North.

In 1878, Patterson resigned his provincial seat to run for the federal House of Commons. He was elected in the riding of Essex, defeating Liberal William McGregor by 2596 votes to 2318.

Patterson became a backbench supporter of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald&#x27;s government and was re-elected in the federal riding of Essex North in 1882 and 1887. On the former occasion, he defeated J.A. Kilroy by 1714 votes to 1022. On the latter, he defeated Liberal Francis Cleary by 2301 votes to 2165. He also served as president of the Ontario Conservative Union during a part of his time in parliament.

Patterson was defeated in the federal election of 1891, losing to William McGregor by 2892 votes to 2043. In spite of this, he was subsequently called into the cabinet of John Abbott, who became prime minister following Macdonald&#x27;s death following the 1891 election. He was sworn in as Secretary of State of Canada on January 25, 1892, and was re-elected to parliament on February 22 (defeating Liberal Malcolm Colin Cameron by 25 votes in a Huron West by-election).

When John S.D. Thompson replaced Abbott as prime minister in late 1892, Patterson was transferred to the Ministry of Militia and Defence. He held this position until March 26, 1895 (aside from a nine-day gap in December 1894), having been retained in the position when Mackenzie Bowell replaced Thompson in mid-1894. He sought to bolster Canada&#x27;s defensive capabilities and oversaw the construction of fortifications in Esquimalt, British Columbia. After stepping down from his ministry in March 1895, he served as a minister without portfolio.

Patterson resigned from cabinet entirely on September 1, 1895, to be sworn in as the new Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba. This was a period of upheaval in Manitoba&#x27;s political culture, as the Manitoba Schools Question was in the last stages of its ongoing legal challenges. Patterson was responsible for overseeing the end of most state funding for Catholic and francophone schools, although it is not clear that he played a significant role in the matter. The lieutenant governor&#x27;s position was largely ceremonial by this time. Patterson does not appear to have re-entered political life when his term ended in 1900.

In addition to his political career, Patterson was also involved in journalism. He was the founder of &quot;Canadian Magazine&quot;, a work meant to showcase Canada&#x27;s literary culture.

==Legacy==
Patterson is commemorated by Paterson Street in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

J. C. Patterson Collegiate Institute in Windsor, Ontario was named after him.

<text>Shut Up, Little Man! is the title of audio vérité recordings of two argumentative and violent alcoholics, Peter J. Haskett and Raymond Huffman in San Francisco. &quot;Bananafish&quot; magazine arranged for a commercial release of the tapes in 1992.

The recordings were made by &quot;Eddie Lee Sausage&quot; and &quot;Mitchell D.&quot;, who lived in a bright pink apartment building at 237 Steiner Street (dubbed the &quot;Pepto Bismol Palace&quot;) in San Francisco&#x27;s Lower Haight district. Eddie Lee and Mitchell moved into the apartment in 1987, and discovered that their neighbors, Haskett and Huffman, argued nearly constantly, with Peter often shouting &quot;shut up, little man!&quot; at Ray. Eddie and Mitchell began tape recording the arguments, and distributing copies among their friends. Eddie Lee and Mitchell sometimes goaded Ray and Peter with prank telephone calls.

In 1992, Huffman died of a heart attack brought on by colon cancer, pancreatitis, and alcoholism. Haskett died in 1996 of liver problems due to alcoholism.

==Reception==

The first &quot;Shut Up, Little Man!&quot; compact disc was released in early 1993. A number of other volumes were issued later. The recordings quickly gained a cult following, and were adapted into comic books, zines, a theatrical production and the 2001 independent film &quot;Shut Yer Dirty Little Mouth!&quot;, starring Gill Gayle and Glenn Shadix as Ray and Peter, respectively.

The recordings found fame far beyond San Francisco. Lee reports that: 

==Documentary film==
In 2011 a feature documentary called &quot;Shut Up Little Man! – An Audio Misadventure&quot; was selected for the 2011 Sundance Film Festival as part of the World Documentary section, where it had its world premiere. It was written and directed by Matthew Bate and produced by Sophie Hyde. According to Tony Newton—an on-and-off roommate of Haskett and Huffman—despite the near-constant vitriol and occasional physical violence, Peter and Ray were extremely close friends. They cooked for one another, took care of each other while they were sick, and one would often visit the other during hospital stays.

== Popular culture ==
* &quot;This American Life&quot; (then known as &quot;Your Radio Playhouse)&quot; featured the recordings in a 1995 program titled &quot;Quitting&quot;.
* The band Devo had a side project, the Wipeouters, and on their only album there is a track titled &quot;Shut Up, Little Man&quot; using many samples of Ray and Peter.
* San Francisco indie rock band the Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 sampled Peter and Raymond on their 1991 album &quot;Lovelyville&quot; and their song &quot;Raymond H&quot; appeared on their following album, &quot;Mother of All Saints&quot;.
* Boston indie rock band Swirlies excerpted a snippet of Peter and Raymond&#x27;s dialogue on their 1993 album &quot;Blonder Tongue Audio Baton&quot;.
* Judy Hopps&#x27; noisy neighbors in the film &quot;Zootopia&quot; are inspired by Peter and Raymond.
* An episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Banned in Bikini Bottom&quot;, features the phrases &quot;you are a nuisance to my community&quot;, &quot;…said this ninety times&quot;, and &quot;cops, I need you!&quot; In another episode, &quot;Porous Pockets&quot;, SpongeBob says, &quot;and I said, go ahead, let’s do it right now! I got too much hair, anyways.&quot; referring to what Raymond claims he told the police. In &quot;The Algae&#x27;s Always Greener&quot;, Mr. Krabs says to Plankton &quot;you&#x27;re just a dirty little man&quot;. In episode 17 of Season 5, Spongehenge Patrick says &quot;I wanna watch something decent, like...&quot; which may be a reference to the recording in which Raymond and Peter are arguing about what to watch on TV and Raymond says that exact line.
* Songwriter Red Label Catharsis featured samples of Ray and Peter in the song &quot;Black Label The Old Crow&quot;, which relates the dregs of alcoholism, from the 2006 release &quot;Chrystie&quot;.
* On a commentary track for the animated series &quot;Mission Hill&quot;, creators Josh Weinstein and Bill Oakley claim that the characters Gus and Wally were based on Ray and Peter.

<text>Iisakki Vihtori Kosola (10 July 1884 – 14 December 1936) was a Finnish politician, activist and a farmer who served as the leader of the fascist pro-German and anti-communist Lapua Movement, and later as the leader of the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement political party in Finland.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Kosola was born in Ylihärmä, Southern Ostrobothnia to a peasant family. He was the eldest of eight children from his father&#x27;s second marriage. His family&#x27;s farmhouse burnt down the next year, and the family moved to Lapua, buying a house at Liuhtarinkylä. His formative years were spent in farming and cattle-breeding following his father&#x27;s death when Kosola was 17 years old.

=== Political activism ===
During the conscription strikes, Kosola began to become politically active, joining a debate society called &quot;Lazy Society&quot; in 1902.

Kosola was an active recruiter of Finnish Jäger troops to Germany from Autumn 1915, and was incarcerated in 1916. He was imprisoned in Helsinki, then at the Shpalernaya prison in St. Petersburg among other Finnish activists. He was released after the Russian Revolution and eagerly took part in the Finnish Civil War against the Red Guards and the Russians. After the war Kosola led the Lapua White Guard. He also joined the Agrarian League.

In the 1920s he organized Vientirauha, a strikebreakers&#x27; organisation, in Southern Ostrobothnia. He made a speech at the first meeting of the anti-communist Lapua Movement as it was organized in 1929, and was chosen as its leader as the movement radicalized in the following year. He took part in the abortive Mäntsälä Rebellion of 1932 that ended with the dissolution and banning of the Lapua Movement and the brief imprisonment of Kosola.

Kosola was chosen as president of the Lapua Movement&#x27;s successor, the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (IKL), but as the Movement became more political, Kosola had less time to participate in its affairs in Helsinki. Kosola&#x27;s political career ended in 1936, when he was deposed from IKL&#x27;s leadership; he was considered more of a liability than an asset by IKL. Contemporary accounts describe Kosola after being freed from jail as a tired and sick man who drank alcohol to deal with the stress. He was also in excessive debt and his farm was subject to foreclosure and auction. He died of pneumonia in December 1936. Kosola&#x27;s first son, Niilo, bought the farm and was eventually elected as an MP and briefly as a government minister. Kosola&#x27;s second son, Pentti, was imprisoned for murdering a political opponent. Pentti fought in the Winter War (1939–40) as a fighter pilot, but was killed in action.

Kosola&#x27;s radical right-wing politics caused a common saying in the 1930s: &quot;Heil Hitler, meil Kosola,&quot; accented Finnish for &quot;They&#x27;ve got Hitler, we&#x27;ve got Kosola&quot;. Sometimes also a third stanza, &quot;muil Mussolini&quot; (the others have Mussolini) was added. Kosola had a sobriquet &quot;Kosolini&quot; after his charismatic and vivid style of speech similar to Benito Mussolini. According to some contemporaries, he was always conceived of as a fascist dictator of Finland.

<text>George Owen Squier (March 21, 1865 – March 24, 1934) was an American general, scientist, and inventor best known for inventing and popularizing what today is called Muzak.

==Life and military career==

Squier was born in Dryden, Michigan. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in the Class of 1887 and received a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1893. He wrote and edited many books and articles on the subject of radio and electricity. An inventor, he and Dartmouth professor Albert Cushing Crehore developed a magneto-optical streak camera &quot;The Polarizing Photo-chronograph&quot; in 1896 to measure the speed of projectiles both inside a cannon and directly after they left the cannon barrel. This was one of the earliest photonic programs. They also worked to develop synchronous AC telegraphic systems. His biggest contribution was that of telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910 for which he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1919. He was also an elected member of the American Philosophical Society.

In September 1900 Squier sailed from New York for Manila on the cable ship USAT &quot;Burnside&quot;. He was in command of a 25-man Signal Corps detachment that laid the first American telegraph cables in the Philippines.

As executive officer to the Chief Signal Officer, U.S. Signal Corps in 1907, Squier was instrumental in the establishment of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, the first organizational ancestor of the U.S. Air Force. He also was the first military passenger in an airplane on September 12, 1908, and, working with the Wright Brothers, was responsible for the purchase of the first airplanes by the US Army in 1909.

From May 1916 to February 1917, he was Chief of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, the first successor of the Aeronautical Division, before being promoted to major general and appointed Chief Signal Officer during World War I.

In 1922, he created Wired Radio, a service which piped music to businesses and subscribers over wires. In 1934, he changed the service&#x27;s name to &#x27;Muzak&#x27;.

Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; it was pronounced like the word &quot;square&quot;.

He was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution.

==Death==
He died in Washington, D.C., at George Washington Hospital on March 24, 1934 of pneumonia, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Awards==
* Distinguished Service Medal
* Spanish War Service Medal
* Philippine Campaign Medal
* World War I Victory Medal
* Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George
* Commander of the Legion of Honor (France)
* Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy

==Dates of rank==
==Legacy==

In 1943, the U.S. Navy named troopship in his honor. It was the lead ship of its class, which was known as of transport ships.

General Squier Park, a historic district and waterpark in his hometown of Dryden, Michigan, is named in his honor.

<doc id="952605" wikidata="Q4038829" url="?curid=952605" title="Floating Point Systems">
<text>Floating Point Systems, Inc. (FPS), was a Beaverton, Oregon vendor of attached array processors and minisupercomputers. The company was founded in 1970 by former Tektronix engineer Norm Winningstad, with partners Tom Prints, Frank Bouton and Robert Carter. Carter was a salesman for Data General Corp. who persuaded Bouton and Prince to leave Tektronix to start the new company. Winningstad was the fourth partner.

== History==
The original goal of the company was to supply economical, but high-performance, floating-point coprocessors for minicomputers. In 1976, the &quot;AP-120B&quot; array processor was produced. This was soon followed by a unit for larger systems and IBM mainframes, the FPS AP-190. In 1981, the follow-on &quot;FPS-164&quot; was produced, followed by the FPS-264, which had the same architecture. This was five times faster, using ECL instead of TTL chips.

These processors were widely used as attached processors for scientific applications in reflection seismology, physical chemistry, NSA cryptology and other disciplines requiring large numbers of computations. Attached array processors were usually used in facilities where larger supercomputers were either not needed or not affordable. Hundreds if not thousands of FPS boxes were delivered and highly regarded. FPS&#x27;s primary competition up to this time was IBM (3838 array processor) and CSP Inc.

Cornell University, led by physicist Kenneth G. Wilson, made a supercomputer proposal to NSF with IBM to produce a processor array of FPS boxes attached to an IBM mainframe with the name &quot;lCAP&quot;.

=== Parallel processing ===
In 1986, the &quot;T-Series&quot; hypercube computers using INMOS transputers and Weitek floating-point processors was introduced. The T stood for &quot;Tesseract&quot;. Unfortunately, parallel processing was still in its infancy and the software tools and libraries for the T-Series did not facilitate customers&#x27; parallel programming. I/O was also difficult, so the T-Series was discontinued, a mistake costing tens of millions of dollars that was nearly fatal to FPS. A few dozen T-series were delivered.

=== Celerity acquisition; acquisition by Cray ===
In 1988, FPS acquired the assets of Celerity Computing of San Diego, California, renaming itself as FPS Computing. Celerity&#x27;s product lines were further developed by FPS, the Celerity 6000 minisupercomputer being developed into the &quot;FPS Model 500&quot; series.

FPS was acquired by Cray in 1991 for $3.25 million, and their products became the &quot;S-MP&quot; and &quot;APP&quot; product lines of Cray Research.

The S-MP was a SPARC-based multiprocessor server (based on the Model 500); the MCP a matrix co-processor array based on eighty-four Intel i860 processors. After Cray purchased FPS, it changed the group&#x27;s direction by making them &quot;Cray Research Superservers, Inc.&quot;, later becoming the Cray Business Systems Division (Cray BSD). The MCP was renamed the Cray APP. The S-MP architecture was not developed further. Instead, it was replaced by the &quot;Cray Superserver 6400&quot;, (CS6400), which was derived indirectly from a collaboration between Sun Microsystems and Xerox PARC.

=== Acquisition by SGI and Sun ===
Silicon Graphics acquired Cray Research in 1996, and shortly afterward the Cray BSD business unit along with the CS6400 product line was sold to Sun Microsystems for an undisclosed amount (acknowledged later by a Sun executive to be &quot;significantly less than $100 million&quot;). Sun was then able to bring to market the follow-on to the CS6400 which Cray BSD was developing at the time, codenamed &quot;Starfire&quot;, launching it as the Ultra Enterprise 10000 multiprocessor server. This system was followed by the Sun Fire 15K and Sun Fire 25K. These systems allowed Sun to become a first tier vendor in the large server market. In January 2010, Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation.

<text>Jaret Samuel Wright (born December 29, 1975) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played all or parts of 11 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians, San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, and Baltimore Orioles, primarily as a starting pitcher.

==Early life and education==
Wright was born on December 29, 1975 in Anaheim, California, and is the son of Clyde Wright, who himself pitched for nine seasons in the major leagues and three seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball. Wright graduated from Katella High School in Anaheim, where he also played quarterback and linebacker for the football team. He was named league MVP and Orange County High School Player of the Year.

==Professional career==
The Cleveland Indians selected Wright in the first round, with the 10th overall pick, of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft. Following the draft, Wright began his professional career with the Burlington Indians, the team&#x27;s rookie league affiliate in the Appalachian League. The 18-year-old started in four games and had a 5.40 earned run average (ERA).

In 1995, Wright progressed to the Class A Columbus RedStixx in the South Atlantic League, where he went 5–6 with a 3.00 ERA in 24 games. In 1996, he moved up to the Kinston Indians, the team&#x27;s &quot;High-A&quot; affiliate in the Carolina League. He went 7–4 in 19 starts, with a 2.50 ERA. &quot;Baseball America&quot; rated Wright as its #22 prospect and was regularly mentioned by the Cleveland front office as one of the organization&#x27;s top prospects.

The following year, 1997, was a breakout season for Wright. He started with the Akron Aeros, the Double-A in the Eastern League, where he went 3–3 with a 3.67 ERA. He was quickly promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, going 4–1 in 7 starts and sported an impressive 1.80 ERA. On June 3, he pitched a 7-inning, 2-hit shutout against the Indianapolis Indians. That earned Wright a promotion to the big club when a spot opened up.

===Major leagues===
Wright made his major league debut in 1997 with the Indians. Wright found instant success. He posted an 8–3 record with a 4.38 ERA in 16 starts, and also pitched effectively in the postseason. In the deciding seventh game of the 1997 World Series, the Indians opted to start Wright over the more experienced Charles Nagy. Wright left the game after innings with a 2–1 lead; however, the Indians lost in 11 innings. Wright finished fifth in the American League Rookie of the Year Award voting.

Wright had a 12–10 record and a 4.72 ERA in 1998. He suffered from a shoulder injury in 1999, when he went 8–10 with a 6.06 ERA in 26 starts. The injury required two surgeries to repair, costing him parts of the following three seasons.

After Wright went 2–3 with a 15.71 ERA in 2002, the Indians decided not to re-sign him, and he became a free agent. Wright then signed with the San Diego Padres in early 2003. He went 1–5 with an 8.73 ERA in 39 games, all in relief and was traded to the Atlanta Braves in August. After going 1–0 with a 2.00 ERA and not allowing a run in 10 out of his 11 appearances, he was told that he was going to be made a starting pitcher again for the next season.

Wright started 2004 in the minors to build up arm strength, but was called up by the Braves when it was discovered pitcher Paul Byrd needed more time to rehab his arm (he had missed the entire 2003 season due to Tommy John surgery). Wright became the Braves best pitcher that season, going 15–8 with a 3.28 ERA in 32 starts while amassing 159 strikeouts in innings pitched.

In December 2004, Wright signed a three-year, US$21 million deal with the New York Yankees.

On November 12, 2006, the Yankees traded Wright to the Baltimore Orioles for Chris Britton and cash considerations. The Orioles were responsible for paying only $3 million of the $7 million left on Wright&#x27;s contract.

Wright&#x27;s shoulder problems returned in the 2007 season and caused him to spend time on the disabled list twice; he did make three starts in April, each five innings or less, but lost all three of them and accumulated a 6.97 ERA. Wright had started a rehab assignment in September and after 3 games he decided to go home ending the rest of the season. On October 1, 2007, the Orioles released Wright.

On January 23, 2008, Wright signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, which included an invitation to spring training. At the end of spring training, he declined his assignment to the minor leagues and elected to become a free agent. He went unsigned, and never pitched professionally again.

===Coaching===
In January 2023, Wright was named the Pitching Coach of the Windy City ThunderBolts of the Frontier League. It is his first professional coaching experience.

<text>PlayOnline is an online gaming service owned by Square Enix as the launcher application and Internet service for many of the online PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 games the company publishes. Launched on June 6, 2000, the service hosted games including &quot;Front Mission Online&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Earth: The Ring of Dominion&quot;, &quot;Tetra Master&quot;, and the Japanese releases of &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;JongHoLo&quot;. As of 2022, however, the PC version of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; is the only remaining game supported by the service.

PlayOnline was one of the first cross-platform gaming services, and hosted hundreds of thousands of players at its peak. It was shut down for twelve days during the 2011 earthquake in Japan. The platform was also subjected to denial of service attacks and players attempting to cheat were subsequently banned. Starting with &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, Square Enix began moving their online games off the service as membership declined. The termination date for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and PlayOnline on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 was March 2016, with only the PC version of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; still supported.

==History==
===Launch===
PlayOnline was originally conceived as an all-in-one solution to house multiple types of game content. At the &quot;Square Millennium&quot; event in Japan in January 2000, Square announced &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;XI&quot;, with the last scheduled to release in the summer of 2001, and that they had been working on an online portal called PlayOnline with Japanese telecom company NTT Communications, which would feature online games, chat, email, online comics, Internet browsing, online shopping, sports, and instant messaging. The service was first announced as costing ¥500 for monthly membership, and a ¥1000 monthly user fee. &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, then nicknamed &quot;Final Fantasy Online&quot;, was the first game to use the online service. The WonderSwan Color portable gaming system was also planned to be able to connect to PlayOnline through an adapter connected to one of the PlayStation 2&#x27;s USB ports.

PlayOnline opened on June 6, 2000, to both Japanese and English speaking countries with news about upcoming software titles, interviews, and wallpapers. The site&#x27;s merchandise included pieces from &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, &quot;Front Mission&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;.

To encourage early adoption prior to the release of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, Square partnered with BradyGames to publish a paperback strategy guide for &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. The guide became notorious for barely containing any actual guidance. Instead, it asked players multiple times on each page to visit PlayOnline to obtain the solutions to puzzles, etc. Initial plans to utilize PlayOnline with &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; were eventually scrapped.

===Service===
PlayOnline was seen as part of Sony&#x27;s strategy to turn the PlayStation 2 into an Internet set-top box. Accordingly, Sony brought broadband equipment and a hard drive to the PlayStation 2. The quality of the browser was noted in its &quot;clean&quot; graphics, excellent page layouts, and &quot;high quality sound&quot;. The browser was not a general purpose Internet tool, but only accessed Square content, such as news about Square products and a comic-strip walkthrough of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;.

Porting &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; to the Xbox proved difficult due to compatibility issues greater than was hoped for between Xbox Live and PlayOnline, likely because the latter was designed first. After negotiation, Xbox 360 players were able to play the game through PlayOnline&#x27;s servers exclusively, despite Microsoft&#x27;s initial wish that Square Enix would use its own platform. Downloadable content was also not available on the platform since the game played through PlayOnline. It was hoped that content would eventually be offered through the Xbox Live Marketplace. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; started out as a game designed for the PlayOnline game platform.

===Security and outages===
In February 2005, 800 players were banned from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and the card game &quot;Tetra Master&quot; for monopolizing areas where high level items and monsters would spawn, making it impossible for other players to become stronger.

On April 9, 2005, a distributed denial of service attack against PlayOnline&#x27;s servers shut down &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; access for players in North America and Europe for three hours: the attack continued for over a week, leading Square Enix to involve law enforcement. At the time, Square Enix did not reveal if the Japanese server which hosted &quot;Front Mission Online&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Earth&quot;, and Japanese players of &quot;EverQuest II&quot; were affected.

A new security system for players by Square Enix began on April 6, 2009, involving a security token that players could purchase for $9.99 and including an in-game bonus called a &quot;Mog Satchel&quot;.

After Japan&#x27;s 2011 earthquake, Square Enix disabled servers to conserve energy due to the incapacitated state of the region&#x27;s nuclear power plant. This led to a temporary halt of the &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, &quot;XI&quot; and PlayOnline games and services from March 13 to 25. During the power shortage, air conditioning and lighting was reduced, and the subscription fees for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; were waived for the month of April.

===Decline===
In June 2009, Square Enix decided not to use PlayOnline for &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they migrated to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. Two years later, Square Enix merged the account management portion of the PlayOnline service into Square Enix accounts from July and culminating on August 31. However, PlayOnline is still required in order to actually play &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. Square Enix replicated the idea of the friends list from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; in &quot;XIV&quot;. The termination date of service for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and PlayOnline for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 was March 2016.

==Reception==
In December 2001, Square Enix projected it would have 250,000 users by the end of the year, and 400,000 by the end of 2002. The service charged $10 per person, and thus needed 200,000 participants to break even.

By January 2004, PlayOnline had over 500,000 registered users, and slightly under one million active players. By September, the service had 1.2 million characters, with most players having two to three characters. In May 2005, &quot;Front Mission Online&quot; became the second game to utilize the service, retailing at ¥7,140 with a monthly subscription price of ¥1,344. In June 2009, a San Francisco resident sued Square Enix for &quot;deceptive advertising, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, and sought a $5 million settlement.

Composer Nobuo Uematsu said that Square&#x27;s efforts to push forward with online gaming was important to the video game industry&#x27;s development. The PlayOnline Viewer was criticized as being nothing more than a longer way to get to &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;″s content. The game also had unmoderated chat rooms that ended up with explicit content. The interface was also described as &quot;clunky&quot; with &quot;strange functional restrictions&quot;.

<doc id="952616" wikidata="Q1191955" url="?curid=952616" title="Hanaukyo Maid Team">
<text>is a Japanese manga series created by Morishige.

&quot;Hanaukyo Maid Team&quot; is about a young boy, Taro Hanaukyo, who has inherited a vast family fortune and, more importantly, the hundreds of employees working at the family mansion. While dressed and referred to nominally as &#x27;maids&#x27;, there are discrete albeit sometimes unusual departments for most of the employees (including Defence, Science, Catering, etc.). Presumably the various extensive projects in the house pay for most of its expenses.

The original anime, which aired as part of the omnibus program Anime Complex, was cut short when the series ran into production issues. Continuity was later rebooted for the new series &quot;Hanaukyo Maid Team: La Verite&quot; (&quot;Hanaukyō Maid Tai - La Verite&quot; in Japan). Many of the early episodes mirror each other closely, with some variations. Both anime versions use the same voice actors.

The English &quot;La Verite&quot; anime was originally licensed by Geneon Entertainment in North America, but Sentai Filmworks acquired the license in 2016 after Geneon&#x27;s license expired. Studio Ironcat licensed the manga in North America; Ironcat as of 2005 went out of business having only released the first three volumes of the manga in English. There are currently no plans for another company to pick up the license and release the remaining volumes.

==Characters==
:&quot;Voiced by&quot;: , Yuri Lowenthal (English)
:A short, quiet, patient and persuasive middle school boy who inherits his mysterious grandfather&#x27;s home at the age of 14. A common source of humor is his dealing with the overeager work ethic of the maids. He is put off by fawning women. (In the original anime series, this was exaggerated into a near-allergic reaction to any contact with a woman except one.) He thinks of his maids as friends and family rather than servants, and treats them as such, much to the consternation of some. He is rather blatantly attracted to Mariel. His name is spelled as &quot;Tarou Hanaukyo&quot; in the first English volume of the manga. As a point of interest, Tarou is shown cosplaying as Mahoro from &quot;Mahoromatic&quot;, even saying her catchphrase &#x27;I think all dirty thoughts are very bad&#x27;.
:&quot;Voiced by&quot;: , Karen Strassman (English)
:Mariel is informally seen as the &quot;head&quot; maid of the house. She is essentially the &quot;perfect&quot; maid—attentive, polite, demure, intelligent, and beautiful. Her devotion is alluded to border on obsessiveness and becomes a major plot point later. (In the original anime series, she had purple hair rather than blue). She is eventually revealed to have been the product of &quot;Project: Blue Silent Bell&quot;, a genetic engineering project aimed at creating the ideal maid for Tarou. Her true feelings and emotions are buried underneath layers of emotional programming, and at the end of the series Tarou commits himself to bringing them out. (At any rate, her devotion to and affection for Tarou appear to be sincere, despite the programming.) As a point of interest, in one episode, Mariel is shown cosplaying as Chi from &quot;Chobits&quot;, who was also voiced by Rie Tanaka.
:&quot;Voiced by:&quot; /Jessica Straus (English)
:One of Taro&#x27;s friends, a 17-year-old maid with thick glasses and often sporting a sly mischievous look. She is the head of the Technology Department, and specializes in mechanics and odd inventions, some of them blowing up or otherwise malfunctioning in rather hilarious ways. Rather oddly enough, she is also an otaku. In one episode rife with nods to other anime, she brings several other characters to the world-famous &quot;Comic Market&quot; (&quot;Komiketto&quot; for short in Japanese) in Tokyo with her self-made dōjinshi.
:&quot;Voiced by:&quot; /Michelle Ruff (English)
:The 21-year-old head of the Security department, she wears a military uniform under her maid apron. She has a severe personality but usually has everyone&#x27;s best interests at heart. She has a soft spot for dogs, one of the rare times she breaks her overserious visage. The &quot;we&quot; part of Konowe is actually the katakana character &quot;we&quot; (ヱ). She takes her job as both head of security and Taro&#x27;s personal bodyguard very seriously, which initially causes tensions between her and Taro due to his seeming lack of caution. Later she learns to &#x27;lighten up&#x27; but is still very protective of Taro.
:&quot;Voiced by:&quot; (original anime) and (La Verite)/Kate Higgins (English)
:A dark-skinned 15-year-old maid who serves as Konoe&#x27;s adjutant, she originally appears in the first series (with a different hair color, lighter skin and no name). She becomes a fully fleshed out character in the later Hanaukyo Maid series. She specializes in hand-to-hand combat but unfortunately is rarely taken seriously by the other maids who she reprimands often. She also has to constantly correct other people, insisting that Sanae (typically a first name for girls) is her last name. While Konoe sees her as a pupil, Yashima herself is hopelessly and rather blatantly in love with Konoe. This often has her daydreaming up various lesbian fantasies with Konoe returning her feelings, resulting in rather embarrassing moments.
:&quot;Voiced by:&quot;/Sandy Fox (English)
:A silent, 10-year-old blonde girl who was praised, exploited, and subsequently shunned for her genius. She seemed to develop another personality named &#x27;Grace&#x27;: a vocal, stubborn, and tougher personality to protect herself. They apparently take turns at being &#x27;aware&#x27; while the other sleeps, although they can speak to each other. It was later implied this arrangement is physically detrimental and exacerbated by Grace&#x27;s tendency to overwork. As Grace, she is in charge of the Computer Security department, and is in charge of Hanaukyo Mansion&#x27;s cyber-heart, the MEMOL supercomputer.
:&quot;Voiced by:&quot; /Wendee Lee (English)
:Would-be master of an equally wealthy rival house to the Hanaukyos, annoyed with the condition she would become master of her house if she married the head of the Hanaukyo family. She was even more enraged to find the current head to be a &#x27;whiny midget,&#x27; but later grows to like him somewhat. She is a military fan and later strikes up an obsessive competition to beat Mariel and prove herself, to the point of joining the household as a maid, and eventually taking over the Physical Health Department. Her bluntness and short temper sometimes comes in handy. Naturally, Ryuuka&#x27;s home seems to also have a vast staff, but of handsome men rather than cute maids.

:Identical triplets who work for the . Because of their questionable imaginations, this usually consists of them attempting various lewd acts on Taro around and during bedtime, which he nonetheless seems to avoid (in the first anime his attempts to dodge them are much less successful, the easiest example being the three of them cornering him in bed at the end of the first episode. In the manga, he managed to escape, in the anime, one of the girls shuts off the light and three hearts pop up, and we hear Taro calling for help). One possible explanation for this is the fact that all three are rather blatantly in lust with him.

<text>The Thorns were an American acoustic rock band formed in 2002 as a project of Matthew Sweet, Pete Droge, and Shawn Mullins.

The band toured the United States and Europe throughout 2003 in support of their eponymous debut album. The band toured supporting a number of acts, including The Jayhawks and The Dixie Chicks.

The band had scored radio airplay with their cover of The Jayhawks song &quot;Blue&quot;, and their only album charted at #62 on the Billboard charts. The album was later reissued the following year with a second disc of acoustic re-recordings of the album.

That same year, the band was featured on the television series &quot;American Dreams&quot; performing a cover of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Warmth of the Sun&quot;. The band broke up in 2004 with each member resuming their solo careers.

The band&#x27;s song &quot;Among the Living&quot; was featured in the 2019 Netflix series &quot;After Life&quot;.

<doc id="952624" wikidata="Q318305" url="?curid=952624" title="Germany men's national ice hockey team">
<text>The German men&#x27;s national ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team of Germany and is controlled by the German Ice Hockey Federation. It first participated in serious international competition at the 1911 European Hockey Championship. When Germany was split after World War II, a separate East Germany national ice hockey team existed until 1990. By 1991, the West and East German teams and players were merged into the United German team. The team&#x27;s head coach is Harold Kreis.

Germany has won several medals at the World Championships, including three silver medals in 1930, 1953 and 2023, as well as a silver medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics, the team&#x27;s biggest success in the 21st century.

==History==
===West Germany===
The West German team&#x27;s greatest success came in 1976 at the Winter Olympics, when the team went 2–3–0 and won the bronze medal. The Swedish and Canadian teams, traditionally two hockey powerhouses, had boycotted the 1976 Games in protest of the amateur rules that allowed Eastern Bloc countries to send their best players while keeping Western nations from doing the same.

West Germany&#x27;s wins in the 1976 Games came against the United States (4–1) and Poland (7–4).

In 1980, the team didn&#x27;t do as well and only won one game in the preliminary round, which kept them from advancing. They finished 10th out of 12.

In 1984, the team was invited to the Canada Cup. By 1991, the reunification of East and West Germany meant the inclusion of players from the former East Germany.

===Post-unification===
The team is not considered to be as elite as Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden or the United States; they are ranked 9th in the world (2022) by the IIHF. Since re-unification, their best recent results include finishing 6th place at the 2003 World Championships where they lost a close quarter-final match in overtime to Canada, and 4th at the 2010 World Championships where they lost to Sweden in the bronze medal game. Previously, they finished third in the European Group and qualified for the quarter-finals at the 1996 World Cup after a surprising 7–1 victory against the Czech Republic. In the 1992 Olympics, they lost to Canada 4–3 in an overtime shoot-out in the quarter-finals.

Germany has never won an international competition, and their most recent medal was silver in the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, when they lost to the Olympic Athletes From Russia 4–3 in overtime. It was the first time that Germany had reached the Gold Medal Game at the Winter Olympics. This was their best result, tied with a silver medal at the 1930 World Championships.

There are 25,934 registered players in Germany (0.03% of its population).

Team Germany finished in 4th place at the 2010 IIHF World Championship, their best placement since 1953.

<text>German Canadians ( or , ) are Canadian citizens of German ancestry or Germans who emigrated to and reside in Canada. According to the 2016 census, there are 3,322,405 Canadians with full or partial German ancestry. Some immigrants came from what is today Germany, while larger numbers came from German settlements in Eastern Europe and Imperial Russia; others came from parts of the German Confederation, Austria-Hungary and Switzerland.

==History==

===Historiography of Germans in Canada===

In modern German, the endonym is used in reference to the German language and people. Before the modern era and especially the unification of Germany, &quot;Germany&quot; and &quot;Germans&quot; were ambiguous terms which could at times encompass peoples and territories not only in the modern state of Germany, but also modern-day Poland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Austria, France, the Netherlands, and even Russia and Ukraine. For example, in the Middle Ages, the Latin term was used to refer to West Germanic languages in general, and in English, &quot;Dutch&quot; was sometimes used as a shorthand for any broadly Germanic people. Early Anglophone historians and contemporary travellers in Canada rarely mentioned the ethnic identity, primary language, or place of origin of early settlers at all, and even later historians in the 19th and 20th centuries were prone to using ambiguous terms such as &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot;. This term is sometimes described as a &quot;misnomer&quot; for Germans, but in its usage by English colonial authorities, &quot;Dutch&quot; was often an umbrella term which included people whose Germanic ancestry was in regions as widely separated as Switzerland, the Palatinate (and broader Rhineland), and Holland.

===Early history===

A few Germans came to New France when France colonized the area, but large-scale migration from Germany began only under British rule, when Governor Edward Cornwallis established Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1749. Known as the Foreign Protestants, the continental Protestants were encouraged to migrate to Nova Scotia between 1750 and 1752 to counterbalance the large number of Catholic Acadians. Family surnames, Lutheran churches, and village names along the South Shore of Nova Scotia retain their German heritage, such as Lunenburg. The first German church in Canada, the Little Dutch (Deutsch) Church in Halifax, is on land which was set aside for the German-speaking community in 1756. The church was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997.

====Loyalist migration====
In the late 18th century, British colonies in North America were significantly affected by the outbreak and subsequent loss of the American Revolutionary War. At the time, Great Britain and its overseas empire were ruled by the German-descended King George III, who was also the Prince-Elector of Hanover, a state in what is now northwestern Germany. Thousands of soldiers fighting for the British were members of regiments hired from various small German states. These soldiers were collectively known as &quot;Hessians&quot;, since many of them came from Hesse. Following the defeat of British forces, about 2,200 of them settled in Canada once their terms of service had expired or they had been released from American captivity. For example, a group from the Brunswick Regiment settled southwest of Montreal and south of Quebec City. In this, they formed part of a larger population movement composed of several waves of migration northward from the newly-founded United States to Upper and Lower Canada. In traditional Canadian historiography, these migrants are often grouped together under the broad label of United Empire Loyalists, obscuring particular ethnic and religious identities, as well as their exact motivations for migrating to Canada.

Another broad grouping of migrants were religious nonconformists, such as Quakers, Mennonites, and &quot;Dunkers&quot;, who preferred British rule for religious reasons. These groups were formed on the basis of belief rather than ethnicity, but a number had their origin in Germany or in ethnic German communities in places such as Pennsylvania. These people are sometimes referred to by the Anglicized term &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot;, which derives from the endonym . This term has led to their confusion with modern-day Dutch people. For this reason, some historiographers such as George Elmore Reaman use the term &quot;Pennsylvania German&quot;, in order to distinguish them from migrants originating in Holland. Another complicating factor in assigning definite ethnic identities or origins to many migrants is that a number spent sometimes as long as several generations living in intermediary places such as Pennsylvania, New York, Holland, or England, despite an ultimate origin in Germany. One example is the Irish Palatines, who originated in the Palatinate (today a part of Germany) but had been settled for a time in Ireland by the British Crown.

The largest group fleeing the United States was the Mennonites. Many of their families&#x27; ancestors had been from southern Germany or Switzerland. In the early 1800s, they began to move to what is now southwestern Ontario and settled around the Grand River, especially in Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener) and in the northern part of what later became Waterloo County, Ontario.

The same geographic area also attracted new German migrants from Europe, roughly 50,000 between the 1830 and 1860. Research indicates that there was no apparent conflict between the Germans from Europe and those who came from Pennsylvania.

===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===
By 1871, nearly of the population of Waterloo County had German origins. Especially in Berlin, German was the dominant language spoken. Research indicates that there was no apparent conflict between the Germans from Europe and those who came from Pennsylvania.

The German Protestants developed the Lutheran Church along Canadian lines. In Waterloo County, Ontario, with large German elements that arrived after 1850, the Lutheran churches played major roles in the religious, cultural and social life of the community. After 1914 English became the preferred language for sermons and publications. Absent a seminary, the churches trained their own ministers, but there was a doctrinal schism in the 1860s. While the anglophone Protestants promoted the Social Gospel and prohibition, the Lutherans stood apart.

In Montreal, immigrants and Canadians of German-descent founded the German Society of Montreal in April 1835. The secular organization&#x27;s purpose was to bring together the German community in the city and act as a unified voice, help sick and needy members of the community, and maintain customs and traditions. The Society is still active and celebrated its 180th anniversary in 2015.
Western Canada started to attract in 1896 and draw large numbers of other German immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe. Plautdietsch-speaking Russian Mennonites of Dutch-Prussian ancestry were especially prominent since they were persecuted by the Tsarist regime in Russia. The farmers were used to the harsh conditions of farming in southern Imperial Russia (now Ukraine) and so were some of the most successful in adapting to the Canadian Prairies. Their increase accelerated in the 1920s, when the United States imposed quotas on Central and Eastern European immigration. Soon, Canada imposed its own limits, however, and prevented most of those trying to flee the Third Reich from moving to Canada. Many of the Mennonites settled in the areas of Winnipeg and Steinbach, and the area just north of Saskatoon.

By the early 1900s, the northern part of Waterloo County, Ontario exhibited a strong German culture, and people of German origin made up a third of the population in 1911. Lutherans were the primary religious group. There were then nearly three times as many Lutherans as Mennonites. The latter, who had moved here from Pennsylvania in the first half of the 1800s, resided primarily in the rural areas and small communities.

===First World War===

Before and during World War I, there was some anti-German sentiment in the Waterloo County area and some cultural sanctions on the community, primarily in Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener). Mennonites in the area were pacifist and so would not enlist. Immigrants from Germany found it morally difficult to fight against a country that was a significant part of their heritage. Low enlistment rates fueled anti-Germany sentiment that precipitated the Berlin to Kitchener name change in 1916. The city was renamed after Lord Kitchener, famously pictured on the &quot;Lord Kitchener Wants You&quot; recruiting posters.

Several streets in Toronto that had previously been named for Liszt, Humboldt, Schiller, Bismarck, etc. were changed to names with strong British associations, such as Balmoral. There were anti-German riots in Victoria and in Calgary during the first years of the war.

News reports from Waterloo County, Ontario, indicate &quot;A Lutheran minister was pulled out of his house... he was dragged through the streets. German clubs were ransacked through the course of the war. It was just a really nasty time period.&quot; A document in the Archives of Canada makes the following comment: &quot;Although ludicrous to modern eyes, the whole issue of a name for Berlin highlights the effects that fear, hatred and nationalism can have upon a society in the face of war.&quot;

Across Canada, internment camps opened in 1915 and 8,579 &quot;enemy aliens&quot; were held there until the end of the war. Many were German-speaking immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Ukraine. Only 3,138 were classed as prisoners of war; the rest were civilians.

===Second World War and later===
The Second World War saw a renewal of anti-German sentiment in Canada. Under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, some 26 prisoner-of-war camps opened and interned those who had been born in Germany, Italy, and particularly in Japan if they were deemed to be &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. For Germans, that applied especially to single males who had some association with the Nazi Party of Canada. No compensation was paid to them after the war. In Ontario, the largest internment centre for German Canadians was at Camp Petawawa, which housed 750 who had been born in Germany and Austria.

Between 1945 and 1994, some 400,000 German-speaking immigrants arrived in Canada; approximately 270,000 of these arrived by the early 1960s. Around a third of postwar German immigrants were from various parts of Eastern Europe and formerly German or German-ruled territories which fell outside of the boundaries of the two postwar German states. Migration followed a sponsorship system predominantly led by churches, leading to an influx of German immigrants to existing German neighbourhoods in cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, as well as rural townships in the Prairies. Alexander Freund remarks that &quot;[f]or postwar Canadians [...] the great influx of German-speaking immigrants after the war posed, at least potentially, a personal confrontation with the recent past that could be difficult to navigate.&quot; There were also tensions between Germans and other European immigrants, some of whom had suffered under German occupation in Europe. Postwar Canadians &quot;did not distinguish between Germans and Nazis&quot;, and this perspective was bolstered by decades of American war films which portrayed Germans in an unsympathetic light. Pressure increased on Germans to assimilate. German-Canadians began to create advocacy organizations to promote their interests, such as the Trans-Canada Alliance for German Canadians, which was founded in 1951 by social democrats but was soon taken over by right-wing elements of the German community. In addition, the Canadian Baltic Immigrant Aid Society was founded in 1948 to provide information and aid to Baltic Germans immigrating to Canada.

Going into the 1960s, Canadian nationalism and ethnic politics revolved increasingly around the Anglophone-Francophone divide, leaving little place for other groups, including the Germans. As the war became more distant, the Canadian national narrative, guided by historians, journalists, and veterans&#x27; organizations, was formed with the exclusion of German or other inter-cultural perspectives on the war, emphasizing instead themes of heroism and sacrifice by Canadian soldiers. Some German-Canadians &quot;withdrew into a &#x27;culture of grievance.&#x27;&quot; As time went on, Canadian perspectives broadened around controversial Allied actions such as the bombing of Dresden, which some German-Canadians found encouraging.

==== Prairies ====

There are several German ethnic-bloc settlements in the Canadian Prairies in western Canada. Over a quarter of people in Saskatchewan are German-Canadians. German bloc settlements include the areas around Strasbourg, Bulyea, Leader, Burstall, Fox Valley, Eatonia, St. Walburg, Paradise Hill, Loon Lake, Goodsoil, Pierceland, Meadow Lake, Edenwold, Windthorst, Lemberg, Qu&#x27;appelle, Neudorf, Grayson, Langenburg, Kerrobert, Unity, Luseland, Macklin, Humboldt, Watson, Cudworth, Lampman, Midale, Tribune, Consul, Rockglen, Shaunavon and Swift Current.

In Saskatchewan the German settlers came directly from Russia, or, after 1914 from the Dakotas. They came not as large groups but as part of a chain of family members, where the first immigrants would find suitable locations and send for the others. They formed compact German-speaking communities built around their Catholic or Lutheran churches, and continuing old-world customs. They were farmers who grew wheat and sugar beets. Arrivals from Russia, Bukovina, and Romanian Dobruja established their villages in a 40-mile-wide tract east of Regina. The Germans operated parochial schools primarily to maintain their religious faith; often they offered only an hour of German language instruction a week, but they always had extensive coverage of religion. Most German Catholic children by 1910 attended schools taught entirely in English. From 1900 to 1930, German Catholics generally voted for the Liberal ticket (rather than the Provincial Rights and Conservative tickets), seeing Liberals as more willing to protect religious minorities. Occasionally they voted for Conservatives or independent candidates who offered greater support for public funding of parochial schools. Nazi Germany made a systematic effort to proselytize among Saskatchewan&#x27;s Germans in the 1930s. Fewer than 1% endorsed their message, but some did migrate back to Germany before anti-Nazi sentiment became overwhelming in 1939.

==Culture==
===Music===

The choral tradition is historically very prominent within German music in Canada. In the latter part of the 19th century, &quot;Turnvereine&quot; (Turner clubs) were active in both Canada and the United States, and were associated with communities of German continental immigrants in urban centres such as Cincinnati, Ohio; Buffalo, New York; and Erie, Pennsylvania. The &quot;Sängerfest&quot; (&quot;singer festival&quot;, plural ) movement, which began in Germany at the start of the 19th century, spread to the United States by the 1840s, and to Canada by 1862, when the first major was held in Berlin, Canada West (later Kitchener, Ontario) from August 6 to 9. This followed the format of a typical Turner event by also including theatrical and athletic events, as well as band concerts. Another festival was held the following year in the nearby community of Waterloo, which had an audience of 2000 people. It was followed in 1866 by an even larger event, organized by the German Club of Hamilton, which had 5000 attendees and featured choirs from both Ontario and the United States.

The continued success of these events led to the founding of the (German-Canadian Choir Federation) in Hamilton in 1873 and the Canadian Choir Federation in Berlin in 1893. Major song and music festivals were held by German communities throughout Ontario in Toronto, Hamilton, Waterloo, Bowmanville, Guelph, Sarnia, Port Elgin, Bridgeport, Elmira, and, most often out of all of these, in Berlin. Three of the most spectacular were organized by Berlin&#x27;s Concordia Club; one 1879 festival which was organized by the club attracted 12,000 visitors. Anti-German sentiment, which arose during the First World War, led to an interruption in the , along with other German cultural institutions, and attempts to re-establish the tradition during the mid-20th century postwar period were largely unsuccessful due to social changes. The last significant in Canada were held in the 1980s.

===Folklore===

The antiquarian, archaeologist, and folklorist William J. Wintemberg produced a number of works on folklore in Ontario during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including communities whose traditions and beliefs were based in the Pennsylvania German cultural milieu. With widespread social change in the 20th century, these traditional beliefs began to decline, though some persisted in reduced form. These communities were deeply religious, but also commonly had spiritual beliefs described by George Elmore Reaman as &quot;mystic&quot;. Their folkloric traditions included proverbs, rituals, and beliefs about the weather, luck, health and health problems, wild and domestic animals, crops, certain herbs and other plants believed to have special properties, witches and witchcraft, blessings, and particular times of the year, such as specific holidays. The moon and its phases were also important to them, as well as the signs of the Zodiac. They had a complex set of beliefs around thunder and lightning and their cause and avoidance, as well as particular beliefs around fires caused by lightning. The celt had some prominence as a cultural object, and was called the (&quot;lightning stone&quot;) or (&quot;thunder wedge&quot;); it was associated with the splitting of trees by lightning. People who were regarded as witches and witch doctors both existed in these communities. Accounts of witches sometimes associate them with curses. Accounts of witch doctors often associate them with charms, or healing of both people and livestock. The famous hex signs painted on barns in Pennsylvania were historically absent from German barns in Ontario, as barns were usually unpainted. There was, however, a strong belief in rituals and objects associated with both good and bad luck; good luck is associated with charms and symbols such as the sign of the cross, the four-leaf clover, and the finding of a horseshoe.

<doc id="952636" wikidata="Q15521623" url="?curid=952636" title="Francis Godschall Johnson">
<text>Sir Francis Godschall Johnson (January 1, 1817 – May 27, 1894) was a Canadian office holder. He was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba on April 9, 1872, but had his commission revoked before he was sworn in. In 1889, he was appointed the 4th chief justice of the Superior Court of Quebec.

==Early life==
Born New Year&#x27;s Day, 1817, at Oakley House in Bedfordshire. He was the son of Captain Godschall Johnson (1780–1859), formerly of the 10th Royal Hussars, and his wife Lucy (died 1823), daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp (1753–1828) 8th Bt., of Parham Park, West Sussex; 12th Baron Zouche. He was a nephew of Colonel Cecil Bisshopp. Francis Johnson was educated at Harrow and afterwards at Saint-Omer and Bruges. In his early life he had the reputation of an excellent athlete, and in later life he was remembered as a renowned wit.

Johnson moved to Montreal, Lower Canada, in the 1830s, where he studied law. From 1834 to 1836, he articled under Henry Pearce Driscoll of Montreal. He was called to the bar in 1839, and became known as a leading figure in criminal law. His career was undoubtedly helped by his bilingualism. On February 11, 1848, he was appointed a queen&#x27;s counsel (QC).

Politically, Johnson was a Conservative. He was elected a vice-president of the British American League in 1849, and opposed the Rebellion Losses Bill later in the same year. He also signed the Annexation Manifesto, for which he was stripped of his QC (which was not restored until 1853).

On March 4, 1856, at St John&#x27;s Church, Red River, he married Mary Louisa Mills, eldest daughter of Thomas Milliken Mills of Taunton, Somerset.

==Legal career==
In 1854, Johnson was commissioned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to work as a legal administrator in Assiniboia. He was soon recognized as one of the most competent figures in the Company, and became Assistant Governor of Assiniboia on July 19, 1855. On November 26, he succeeded William Bletterman Caldwell as governor, also retaining his legal portfolio. He appears to have been popular and respected during his time in the territory.

Johnson returned to Montreal in 1858, and resumed his legal practice. He was appointed a judge in 1865.

In 1870, he was commissioned by George-Étienne Cartier to become the first legal recorder in the new province of Manitoba. He was sworn in on October 19, and sought to develop a functioning legal system in the province.

==Political career==
On October 21, 1870, Lieutenant Governor Adams George Archibald appointed Francis as a legislative councillor in the North-West Territories. This appointment made him the first councillor and member of the Executive Council in the territory. The appointment to the Temporary North-West Council was quickly revoked by the federal government, however, which ruled that Archibald had overstepped his authority in granting it.

On April 9, 1872, Johnson reluctantly agreed to replace Archibald as lieutenant governor of the territories. This appointment was also revoked, following opposition in the House of Commons of Canada to a government appointee holding two paid positions. Johnson was never sworn into office, despite his continued popularity in the region.

==Judicial career==
Johnson returned to Montreal later in 1872, and was appointed a judge of the Superior Court of Quebec. On December 9, 1889, he was appointed its chief justice.

<doc id="952648" wikidata="Q711227" url="?curid=952648" title="Supercar (TV series)">
<text>Supercar is a British children&#x27;s science fiction television series produced by Gerry Anderson and Arthur Provis&#x27; AP Films (APF) for Associated Television and ITC Entertainment. Two series totalling 39 episodes were filmed between September 1960 and January 1962. Budgeted at £2,000 per episode, it was Anderson&#x27;s first half-hour series, as well as his first science fiction production.

The series uses Supermarionation puppetry and scale model special effects. Anderson would later claim that the whole point of having a series based on a vehicle was to minimise having to show the marionettes walking, an action which he felt never looked convincing. Though the series&#x27; creation was credited to Gerry Anderson and Reg Hill, it also incorporates elements of &quot;Beaker&#x27;s Bureau&quot;, an unmade series that scriptwriter Hugh Woodhouse had pitched to the BBC. The music was composed and conducted by Barry Gray. For the first series, the opening and closing theme song vocalist was Mike Sammes; for the second series, Sammes&#x27; vocal group The Mike Sammes Singers re-recorded the theme.

In the UK, the series premiered on 28 January 1961 in the London area and was later shown on other regional franchises of the ITV network. It was repeated in various regions until 1968, and again by Granada Television between 1971 and 1973. In Canada, it aired on CBC, and in the U.S. in syndication (the first Anderson series to be shown overseas), debuting in 1962. It eventually aired in more than 40 countries.

The series is available on DVD in the United Kingdom, Australia, and North America, where it has been issued twice. It was released on Blu-ray in 2021, its 60th anniversary year.

==Premise==
The star of the series was &quot;Supercar&quot;, a multi-environment craft invented by Professor Rudolph Popkiss and Doctor Horatio Beaker, and piloted by Mike Mercury. Airbreathing jet engines and retractable wings in the rear allowed it to fly like a vertical-takeoff-and-landing aeroplane; retrorockets on the side slowed it. On land it rode on a cushion of air rather than wheels. Non-airbreathing rocket engines allowed it to travel underwater like a submarine and fly in outer space. Its navigation system contained &quot;Clear-Vu&quot; to allow the pilot to see through fog and smoke. It was housed in and supported from a laboratory at Black Rock, Nevada.

In the first episode, &quot;Rescue&quot;, the Supercar&#x27;s mission is to save passengers of a downed private plane. Two of the rescued, young Jimmy Gibson and his pet monkey Mitch, are invited to live at the facility and share in subsequent adventures.

The series inaugurated what became an Anderson trademark: the launch sequence. With the exception of &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, all of his series until &quot;Terrahawks&quot; included these – in &quot;Supercar&quot;″s case, the charging and firing of port and starboard engines, the activation of an interlock, the opening of (overhead) hangar doors, and finally the vertical take-off.

==Characters==
=== Heroes ===
* Mike Mercury: test pilot of Supercar; voiced by Graydon Gould
* Professor Rudolph Popkiss: co-inventor of Supercar; voiced by George Murcell in series 1 and Cyril Shaps in series 2
* Doctor Horatio Beaker: co-inventor of Supercar; voiced by David Graham.
* Jimmy Gibson: kid brother of Mike&#x27;s pilot friend Bill Gibson, saved by Mike in episode 1; voiced by Sylvia Anderson
* Mitch: Jimmy&#x27;s pet monkey; voiced by David Graham.

=== Recurring villains ===

==Production==
After Granada Television declined to order a second series of &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, its creator Gerry Anderson approached Lew Grade of ATV with the idea for &quot;Supercar&quot;. Anderson proposed a budget of £3,000 per episode, which Grade demanded be cut in half. After working through the night, Anderson returned the next morning with the budget reduced by only a third. However, Grade still commissioned the series.

Anderson always claimed that he invented a futuristic vehicle as an excuse to reduce the amount of walking the marionettes had to do, which could never be made to look realistic. This was taken to its conclusion in &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;, in which the marionette puppets are almost never seen walking.

Scriptwriter brothers Hugh and Martin Woodhouse devised supporting characters Dr Beaker, Masterspy and Zarin to expand on Anderson&#x27;s original concept, which featured only Mike Mercury, Jimmy and Mitch. Before partnering with Anderson, the Woodhouses had been developing their own series about the Beaker character under the working title &quot;Beaker&#x27;s Bureau&quot;. The brothers wrote one complete &quot;shooting (camera-ready) script&quot; per week to accommodate Anderson&#x27;s (and Grade&#x27;s) cost and production schedule.

There were several working models of Supercar, which was designed by art director Reg Hill. The larger &quot;hero&quot; model was about long and cost £1,000 to build. Made of lightweight wood and Perspex, it was constructed by Laurie Barr of Aeronautical and General Modelmakers (now Mastermodels). A mid-sized model, around long and sculpted by Slough craftsman Bill James, as well as a smaller model, about , were used for the titles. One of the smaller models, used in distance shots, was about in length and was also sculpted by Bill James. John Peel likens Supercar&#x27;s appearance to that of the 1959 Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty.

===Voice casting===
The cast for &quot;Supercar&quot; was put together weeks before shooting was to commence. The lines were recorded in the rushes theatre, which was transformed into a recording studio. Lines were recorded on a Sunday (once every month), because the studio was on a trading estate, meaning Sundays were the quietest days of the week. The recording sessions typically took place between 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., during which time the cast, along with the sound engineers, would try to get through at least three scripts.

Canadian actor Graydon Gould (&quot;The Forest Rangers&quot;), who voiced Mike Mercury despite never auditioning for the part, was offered it whilst doing a stage production that was shown on television. In an interview Gould recalls that, without owning a car, getting to Slough was difficult because &quot;Sunday transport is about half of what it normally is&quot; but because he had a wife, a two-year-old child and a three-bedroom apartment, he was grateful for the money. Voice director Sylvia Anderson (credited as Sylvia Thamm on series 1) helped Gould with his accent; he recalls, &quot;she would point out when my Canadian accent was slipping through&quot;.

David Graham voiced three characters for the series: Doctor Beaker, Zarin, and Mitch the Monkey. He also voiced the recurring character of Bill Gibson. He had previously worked on the series &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; where he had shown his ability to provide a variety of different voices. Graham had based his voice for Dr Beaker on veteran actor Felix Aylmer, while he also spent a day at London Zoo watching monkeys at the Monkey House, trying get a good interpretation as to how Mitch should sound.

George Murcell voiced Professor Popkiss and Masterspy for the first series. He had previously worked for AP Films when playing the character Diamond in the low-budget B-Movie &quot;Crossroads to Crime&quot; alongside David Graham. Graham believes that because of his voice quality, Gerry thought he would make a good Masterspy, while Gould remembers Murcell doing &quot;all the European voices&quot;. Murcell left the series after 24 episodes, which explains why he and Popkiss do not appear in the last two episodes of the first series.

Sylvia Anderson voiced Jimmy Gibson and all the female characters. However she did not receive a cast credit for the first series. Originally Sylvia was not to voice Jimmy, but she was given the opportunity when Gerry was not happy with the original voice of Jimmy that had already been recorded. This marked Sylvia&#x27;s first involvement in voice acting.

===Filming===
Principal photography on the first 26 episodes began in September 1960, with the production filming at a rate of one episode every two weeks. By the end of December, 13 episodes had been completed; the 26th was finished in April 1961. During production, Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Thamm married. After a brief midday wedding, the couple returned to the studio to help complete the opening title sequence.

The series&#x27; scale model aerial photography effects were created by filming the miniatures in front of rear-projected footage of a cloud-filled sky, shot from an Airspeed Oxford flying at . This marked APF&#x27;s first use of rear-projection effects. Background footage for driving scenes was filmed on the M1 motorway. The shots of Supercar entering and exiting the sea were filmed on a shallow outdoor pool. The dive shot was achieved by splicing the footage of the model with a splash from a rock. To film the exit, the crew yanked the submerged model out of the water on a fishing line.

Other effects scenes were filmed using miniature models or painted backdrops. To create underwater sequences, a thin aquarium containing tiny fish was placed between the camera and the set; as the &quot;Supercar&quot; model was flown across the set on wires, the underwater effect was completed by connecting an air-line to the aquarium to produce bubble jets, and splashing the water to scatter the studio lighting and simulate refracted sunlight. Model sets featuring vegetation used cuttings from real trees for greater realism.

===Series 2===
After Grade ordered a further 13 episodes, filming on a second production block began in October 1961. For this second block, production time was shortened by splitting the crew into two units and filming episodes in pairs based on overlapping schedules, allowing two episodes to be completed in as many weeks. It also saw the introduction of a dedicated special effects unit (led by Derek Meddings and Brian Johnson).

With the departure of Murcell, Cyril Shaps was brought in to voice Professor Popkiss and Masterspy. David Graham was a friend of Shaps and suggested him for the part. At the time Shaps was performing in the West End play &quot;The Tenth Man&quot;, which Graham and the Andersons went to see.

Regarded as &quot;Series 2&quot; of &quot;Supercar&quot;, the final 13 episodes were the first APF productions to be credited as &quot;Filmed in Supermarionation&quot;. Production ended in December 1961.

==U.S. syndication==
&quot;Supercar&quot; debuted in the U.S. on WPIX, a local station in New York, on Saturday 6 January 1962 at 6:30 pm. The station&#x27;s EVP and general manager, Fred M. Thrower, reported to ITC that after four weeks the show &quot;has solidly established itself as the number one program in its time period and the number one weekend children&#x27;s show in New York among all local children shows in this market&quot; with an average ARB rating of 15.2. Sales revenue after eight weeks was $750,000.

By autumn 1962, more than 100 American stations were airing the series. By the following January, &quot;Supercar&quot; had been sold into 140 U.S. and 49 foreign markets for $1.9 million in total sales, guaranteeing production of a second series of shows.

==Reception==
According to Robert Sellers, while 21st-century audiences may find the series &quot;tame and a little infantile&quot; compared to APF&#x27;s later work, &quot;Supercar&quot; is sustained by good writing, characterisation and production design. Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping regard Mike Mercury as the template for later protagonists, writing that his &quot;square-jawed, mid-Atlantic&quot; bearing made him the &quot;prototypical&quot; Gerry Anderson hero.

Rating the series 8 out of 10, Rick Sanchez of IGN praises the writing and characters. However, he considers the plots &quot;a bit formulaic&quot; from a modern perspective, and suggests that recurring villain Masterspy is overused.

In a review for DVD Talk, Glenn Erickson gave the series the highest rating of &quot;Excellent&quot;, praising its puppet sets, scale model work, special effects and &quot;razor-sharp&quot; cinematography. He wrote that the production values were of a kind which &quot;simply weren&#x27;t seen in 1960 children&#x27;s programming, which made this peppy half-hour programme a sure bet for syndication.&quot; He also commented that the inclusion of Mitch the Monkey as an anthropomorphic character was a welcome departure from other children&#x27;s shows, which typically focused on &quot;Lassie-like genius animals&quot;.

By contrast, Matt Hinrichs of DVD Talk rated the series two out of five, describing it as a &quot;primitive precursor to &quot;Stingray&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;&quot;, and best skipped. Calling the production standards &quot;modest&quot;, he wrote that much of the series was &quot;repetitive, snail-paced and unimaginative&quot;, also arguing that it had &quot;too many awkward components [...] to meld into a satisfying whole&quot;. He believed that although the changes between production blocks made the second series superior to the first, ultimately they only turned &quot;a crude, boring time-waster into something that was merely passable&quot;.

Noting aspects such as the lack of female regular characters, Marcus Hearn describes &quot;Supercar&quot; as being &quot;squarely aimed at little boys of the Meccano era&quot;. Hearn also writes that the series&#x27; over-arching &quot;rescue theme&quot;, as well as its &quot;fetishisation&quot; of technology, make it comparable to APF&#x27;s later science fiction productions.

Jonathan Bignell writes that as in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the villains appear to operate &quot;outside geopolitical conflict&quot;, although Masterspy and Zarin and the plot of the episode &quot;Island Incident&quot; carry echoes of the Cold War. Bignell also notes that the heroes are a multinational &quot;British, European and American team&quot;.

==Comic book==
In the UK, comics based on the series appeared in &quot;TV Comic&quot; from 1961 to 1964, running from issue #483 (18 March 1961) until issue #667 (26 September 1964). These stories were drawn by Harold Tamblyn-Watts and Bill Mevin. Further &quot;Supercar&quot; comics were published in &quot;TV Century 21&quot;, from 23 January 1965 to 8 January 1966, drawn by Bruno Marraffa.

&quot;Supercar&quot; was the first Gerry Anderson series to be adapted as a comic book in America, with the Gold Key company releasing four issues between November 1962 and August 1963.

Misc!Mayhem Productions in the U.S. planned to release a five-issue &quot;Supercar&quot; licensed comic book mini-series &quot;picking up where the classic Gerry Anderson TV series left off&quot;. Only the first issue (Vol. 1. No.0) appeared in February 2003.

==Soundtrack==
In 1998, Fanderson issued a limited-edition album of Barry Gray&#x27;s music from the series, paired with his work on &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;. It was the first soundtrack album produced by the society.

In 2013, the society released a second limited-edition disc, this one completely devoted to the series.

<doc id="952655" wikidata="Q6797119" url="?curid=952655" title="Mayfair (magazine)">
<text>Mayfair is a British adult magazine published monthly by Paul Raymond Publications. Founded in 1966, it was designed as a response to US magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;, the latter of which had recently launched in the UK. For many years, it claimed the largest distribution of any men&#x27;s magazine in the UK. It is a softcore magazine, and thus is available in newsagents, although some larger retailers require a modesty bag to hide the cover.

==Fisk Publishing era==
&quot;Mayfair&quot; was launched by Fisk Publishing Ltd in 1966 with an August cover date. The company was controlled by Brian Fisk. Its first editor was David Campbell, and its first deputy editor was Graham Masterton. Its second editor was &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot; veteran Kenneth Bound. As well as nudes, &quot;Mayfair&quot; featured short stories and serious articles on such &quot;male&quot; interests as classic cars, trains, and military history. In its early years, one regular contributor of fiction and nonfiction was American author William S. Burroughs (who became an associate of Masterton&#x27;s; Masterton later gave Burroughs a posthumous co-author credit on his novel &quot;Rules of Duel&quot; ).

A regular feature for many years was Quest, &quot;the laboratory of human response&quot;, interviews purportedly with ordinary people (each issue featuring separate conversations with two women and one man, and occasionally couples) about sex matters, and graphic descriptions of sexual encounters. Graham Masterton initially wrote Quest as fiction, but later interviewed real people to inform the article. Another regular feature was a long-running cartoon strip featuring the misadventures of Carrie, a nubile blonde who lost her clothes in various embarrassing situations.

In 1968, &quot;Mayfair&quot; took over rival &quot;King&quot;, which had been launched in 1964, initially with backing from Paul Raymond.

The December issue of each year was usually double-sized, and featured a &quot;review&quot; of the models seen in previous issues. For many years, this was from the previous year, e.g. the review in Volume 16, Number 12 (December 1981) featured the models seen throughout Volume 15 (January to December 1980). In 1982, a separate and nominally annual &quot;Best of Mayfair&quot; supplement was introduced, reprinting the full photo sets and other items. This was followed in 1988 by a similar &quot;Girls of Summer&quot; supplement.

In August 1972, &quot;Mayfair&quot; featured the regular comic-strip adventures of &quot;Carrie&quot; with story and fully painted artwork by Don Lawrence. The strip ran for two pages a month for most issues over the next 17 years. Don Lawrence left at the end of 1975, and Mario Capaldi drew the strip from January 1976 to May 1977. In June 1977, Steve Kingston took over.

Most of the models featured were &quot;girl next door&quot; types whom the accompanying text claimed to be new to such work. Their pictures would be accompanied by descriptions of their everyday lives and jobs, including that of telephonists, secretaries, shopkeepers, etc. &quot;Page 3&quot; girls were also regular features. Some of the early ones would appear full frontal (tabloid papers such as &quot;The Sun&quot; only featured topless images), but in the late 1980s most such as Samantha Fox and Maria Whittaker would only do topless appearances.

Occasionally couples, male and female models and sets of two or more girls together (though lesbianism was usually implied rather than made obvious) were featured.

In March 1982, Robert Maxwell reached an agreement to buy &quot;Mayfair&quot; from Yvonne Fisk (widow of founder Brian). However, Bound persuaded Maxwell to let him mount a management buyout, instead.

Many aspects of the magazine changed when Kenneth Bound agreed to sell the magazine to Paul Raymond Publications. The last issue from Bound/Fisk was Volume 26 Number 1 (January 1991), at which time the magazine had a net paid circulation of 295,646 according to the UK Audit Bureau of Circulations.

==Paul Raymond Publications era==
The change of ownership and the appointment of Stephen Bleach as editor led to more explicitness, more girl-on-girl material, and a focus on established models, mostly with large-breasted figures. The detailed description of the girls&#x27; &quot;everyday lives&quot; gave way to explicit descriptions of their sex lives.

The serious content was gradually dropped in favour of an approach more akin to mainstream magazines such as &quot;Loaded&quot;, while the male interviewees in Quest were dropped in favour of more extreme female-only contributions, including lesbianism.

Today, &quot;Mayfair&quot; is published every four weeks along with fellow Paul Raymond adult titles such as &quot;Club International&quot;, &quot;Escort&quot;, &quot;Men Only&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s World&quot;, and &quot;Razzle&quot;.

Paul Chaplin, also known as Paul Baxendale-Walker, acquired ownership of the Paul Raymond Publications titles in August 2012.

&quot;Mayfair&quot; is also sold in digital format. Initially this was via the Paul Raymond digital newsstand from 2013 until that website closed. Subsequently it has been available digitally from the main Paul Raymond website.

==Bans==
In common with many soft-core publications, &quot;Mayfair&quot; was specifically banned in Ireland in 1968, and remained so until successfully appealed along with four other Paul Raymond titles on 21 November 2011.

The March 1987 issue featured a model named Tina Reid, stating she had only recently turned 17 when the pictures were taken. When it emerged that she was 15, all copies were withdrawn from UK shops. Nevertheless, Reid later appeared in a number of other glamour magazines (sometimes using the pseudonym of &quot;Trixie Buckingham&quot;), as well as acting under the name Louise Germaine, notably in Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;Lipstick on Your Collar&quot; and &quot;Midnight Movie&quot;.

==Contents==
Current issues of the magazine (2011) follow a common monthly format consisting of several regular sections and seven photo shoots, six of which are brand new to print in the UK and the last being a rerun of a classic photo shoot from yesteryear. The contents below is representative of this format:

# Mayfair Male – This section contains letters from readers.
# Mayfair Presents – A profile of a model or porn star, looking at how she got into the industry, and how (and who!) she has been doing since 
# 21st Century Toys – This is a light-hearted review of electronic gadgets and gizmos
# Mayfair Movies – A review of the latest batch of pornographic movies
# Mayfair Motors – A double-page review focusing on a new car – often featuring high-performance vehicles
# Quest – Stories about the sexual activities of a trio of young women, each following a general theme given in the previous month&#x27;s issue
# Scene – A section containing reviews and write-ups about various differing new releases – typically DVDs and books
# Gentlemen.. – A page of jokes, generally of a groan-inducing nature
# Mayfair Intelligencer – A round-up of weird and mysterious facts, coupled with askew glances at the world of celebrity and Hollywood and guides to modern etiquette

Nude photo shoots are scattered between these sections; each photo shoot generally consists of six or seven pages of photographs along with a short write-up about the model. Often, the model starts the set fully dressed and ends up fully naked.

The final photo shoot in the magazine is a classic shoot that is taken from a previous issue of the magazine, typically from the 1980s or early &#x27;90s.

A single-page comic strip, &quot;Ms. Fortune&quot; by Gabrielle Noble, has featured since 2011. 

Since acquiring ownership in August 2012, Paul Chaplin writes the monthly editorial column, complemented by his own photo shoot of current glamour models. Chaplin has also implemented an editorial change in bringing in more mainstream tabloid page 3 models for shoots.

<text>USS &quot;Daniel Webster&quot; (SSBN-626), a ballistic missile submarine (FBM), was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Senator Daniel Webster.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Daniel Webster&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 3 February 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 28 December 1961. She was launched on 27 April 1963, sponsored by Mrs. Mary Ernestine (Appleton) Goodrich, great-great granddaughter of Daniel Webster and wife of W. Osborn Goodrich, Jr., and commissioned on 9 April 1964, with Commander Marvin S. Blair in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Lloyd S. Smith in command of the Gold Crew.

&quot;Daniel Webster&quot; was originally built with diving planes mounted on a &quot;mini-sail&quot; near the bow, leading to her nickname &quot;Old Funny Fins&quot;. This configuration, unique to US submarines, was an attempt to reduce the effect of porpoising. While successful, the &quot;mini-sail&quot; required to contain the operating mechanism reduced hydrodynamic efficiency and lowered her overall speed.
During a mid-1970s overhaul, these unusual planes were removed and standard fairwater planes were installed.

==Operational history==

While in service, &quot;Daniel Webster&quot; was the last &quot;Lafayette&quot;-class submarine to be retrofitted to carry UGM-73 Poseidon missiles.

Patrol history includes:
Patrol 50 (Gold Crew) July, 1982 from Holy Loch, port calls Groton, CT, and Kings Bay, GA;
Patrol 52 Feb 1983 ERP Holy Loch;
Patrol 56 March 1984 from Holy Loch, port call Naples, Italy; port call Groton, CT in transit to the Naval Weapons Station, Charleston, SC, March 1985; ERP Charleston, April 1985; Patrol 60 June 1985;
Patrol 66 (Gold Crew) December 1986 - March 1987; port call Naples, Italy, March 1987; Patrol 68 June 1987 from Holy Loch, port call November 1987 Lisbon, Portugal.

==Decommissioning and conversion==
&quot;Daniel Webster&quot; was decommissioned on 30 August 1990 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She was converted to a moored training ship (MTS) and S5W reactor prototype training facility, by the Charleston Naval Shipyard at Charleston, South Carolina. Upon completion and designation as the MTS-626, she was towed up-river to her permanent berth at Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit Charleston.

<doc id="952657" wikidata="Q2468414" url="?curid=952657" title="USS Andrew Jackson">
<text>USS &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; (SSBN-619) was a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine. It was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Andrew Jackson (1767–1845), the seventh President of the United States (1829–1837).

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California on 23 July 1960 and her keel was laid down on 26 April 1961. She was launched on 15 September 1962 sponsored by Nancy Patterson Pigott, wife of Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, and commissioned on 3 July 1963, with Commander Alfred J. Whittle, Jr. in command of the Blue Crew and Commander James B. Wilson in command of the Gold Crew.

She was long, wide, and had a draft of . She displaced when surfaced, and when submerged. Her top speed was above , and she had a maximum depth of . She had a complement of around 120 men, and was armed with 16 Polaris missiles and four torpedo tubes. She was propelled by a S5W Pressurized Water Nuclear Reactor powering two turbines which generated , driving one propeller.

==Operational history==

Following commissioning, &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; sailed via the Panama Canal to the United States East Coast. On 1 October and 11 October 1963, during shakedown training out of Cape Canaveral, Florida, she successfully launched Polaris A-2 ballistic missiles. On 26 October 1963, she sent Polaris A-3X missiles into space in the first submerged launching of its type; she repeated the feat on 11 November 1963. On 16 November 1963, six days before his assassination, President John F. Kennedy—embarked in the missile range instrumentation ship —observed &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; launch another Polaris A-2 ballistic missile from a point off Cape Canaveral and congratulated Commander Wilson and his crew for &quot;impressive teamwork.&quot;

===USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident===
There is speculation amongst survivors of the 1967 Israeli attack on USS &quot;Liberty&quot; and their supporters that a U.S. Navy submarine observed and filmed the attack through their periscope. The working theory is that the submarine was either the &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; or . The &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 16, Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet from 1964 to 1973, where she conducted patrols out of the American naval base at Rota, Spain. This would mean she could, in theory, have been in the vicinity of the attack when it occurred. There is no confirmation of this theory and it remains speculative.

In 1988, the LBJ Presidential Library declassified and released a document from the &quot;Liberty&quot; archive with the “Top Secret—Eyes Only” security caveat (Document #12C sanitized and released 21DEC88 under review case 86–199). This &quot;Memorandum for the Record&quot; dated 10 April 1967 reported a briefing of the &quot;303 Committee&quot; by General Ralph D. Steakley. According to the memo, General Steakley &quot;briefed the committee on a sensitive DOD project known as FRONTLET 615,&quot; which is identified in a handwritten note on the original memorandum as &quot;submarine within U.A.R. waters.&quot; Further Freedom of Information Act requests returned no information on any project called “FRONTLET 615.” This has lent credence to the theory that a U.S. Navy submarine was present during the attack.

The 1981 book &quot;Weapons&quot; by Russell Warren Howe says that &quot;Liberty&quot; was accompanied by the &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;, which filmed the entire episode through its periscope but was unable to provide assistance.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; was decommissioned on 31 August 1989 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on the same day. Ex-&quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington. Recycling of Ex-&quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; was completed 30 August 1999.

<text>USS &quot;John Adams&quot; (SSBN-620), a &quot;Lafayette&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Founding Father John Adams (1735–1826), the second President of the United States (1797–1801), and his son John Quincy Adams (1767–1848), the sixth President of the United States (1825–1829). Both names were used with the captains of the Blue and Gold crews alternately using the names John Adams and John Quincy Adams.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;John Adams&quot; was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, on 23 July 1960 and her keel was laid down there on 19 May 1961. She was launched on 12 January 1963 sponsored by Abigail Adams Manny, great, great, great-granddaughter of John Quincy Adams, and wife of James C. Manny, and commissioned on 12 May 1964, with Commander Lando W. Zech, Jr. in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Paul J. Early in command of the Gold Crew.

==Operational history==
Following her commissioning, &quot;John Adams&quot; completed sixteen deterrent patrols while assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet After her sixteenth patrol, she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington for overhaul and modernization in August 1968. She completed overhaul on 10 August 1969 and returned to sea as a unit of the United States Pacific Fleet. Both the Blue Crew and the Gold Crew shot two Polaris ballistic missiles during a Demonstration and Shakedown Operation (DASO) following the overhaul. She conducted sixteen more deterrent patrols as a unit of the Pacific Fleet.

Upon completion of her thirty-second deterrent patrol, &quot;John Adams&quot; entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery for her second overhaul and conversion to the Poseidon missile system. She completed the overhaul and returned to sea once again as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet.

After completing an additional forty-three deterrent patrols from both her home port at Charleston, South Carolina, and from Holy Loch, Scotland, &quot;John Adams&quot; transited the Panama Canal to again enter the Puget Sound Navy Shipyard, this time in preparation for decommissioning after a long and distinguished career. At the time of her decommissioning she had completed 75 strategic deterrent patrols.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;John Adams&quot; was decommissioned on 24 March 1989 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She entered the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington. Recycling of Ex-&quot;John Adams&quot; was completed on 12 February 1996.

<text>USS &quot;James Monroe&quot; (SSBN-622), a ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Founding Father and U.S. president James Monroe. She served with the United States Navy from 1963 to 1990.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;James Monroe&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 3 February 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 31 July 1961. She was launched on 4 August 1962, sponsored by Mrs. Miriam Thorne Gilpatric, wife of Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell L. Gilpatric, and commissioned on 7 December 1963, with Commander William H. Sandford in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Warren R. Cobean, Jr., in command of the Gold Crew.

==Operational history==
Following shakedown off Florida&#x27;s Cape Kennedy, &quot;James Monroe&quot; spent the early months of 1964 in ballistic missile tests. She departed for her first deterrent patrol in June 1964. On 17 January 1967, &quot;James Monroe&quot; completed her twelfth deterrent patrol, having operated from both Holy Loch, Scotland, and Rota, Spain. Preparations for the arrival of the submarine squadron went forward with haste throughout the remainder of 1978 and into 1979. Commander Submarine Squadron 16 greeted the submarine tender , when she arrived at Kings Bay on 2 July 1979. Four days later, USS &quot;James Monroe&quot; entered Kings Bay and moored alongside &quot;Simon Lake&quot;″s starboard side to begin a routine refit in preparation for another nuclear weapons deterrence patrol.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;James Monroe&quot; was decommissioned on 25 September 1990 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Ex-&quot;James Monroe&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington. Recycling of Ex-&quot;James Monroe&quot; was completed on 10 January 1995.

<doc id="952660" wikidata="Q6138608" url="?curid=952660" title="USS Woodrow Wilson">
<text>USS &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; (SSBN-624), a ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Woodrow Wilson (1856–1924), the 28th President of the United States (1913–1921). She later was converted into an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-624.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 9 February 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 13 September 1961. She was launched on 22 February 1963 sponsored by Miss Eleanor Axson Sayre (Wilson&#x27;s granddaughter), and commissioned on 27 December 1963, with Commander Cleo N. Mitchell in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Walter N. Dietzen in command of the Gold Crew.

==Operational history==
&quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; departed Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 9 January 1964, bound for the United States East Coast. After stopping briefly at San Diego, she proceeded on to the Panama Canal, arriving on 19 January 1964 at its western end. Violent anti-American demonstrations and riots over a recent flag-displaying incident had resulted in an extremely tense atmosphere. As a result, she transited the canal in a record seven hours ten minutes while combat-ready United States Marines and United States Army soldiers guarded the locks.

Making port at Charleston, South Carolina, on 5 February 1964, &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise off the lower U.S. East Coast into March 1964 and underwent post-shakedown repairs and alterations into April 1964. She put to sea at the end of May 1964 upon the conclusion of these repairs and alterations and commenced her first deterrent patrol out of Charleston in June 1964.

&quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; subsequently operated in the Atlantic Ocean until the autumn of 1968, conducting patrols from forward bases at Rota, Spain and Holy Loch, Scotland. After undergoing a 13-month overhaul and conversion to the Polaris A3 ballistic missile at Newport News Shipbuilding, she was transferred to the United States Pacific Fleet via Charleston and the Panama Canal, arriving at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 19 November 1969. She then continued on to the western Pacific Ocean, was based at Guam, and conducted deterrent patrols from Apra Harbor through 1972.

In 1972, &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; shifted back to the Atlantic and another overhaul and conversion to the Poseidon C3 missile at Newport News Shipbuilding. She was then home-ported at Charleston for operations with the United States Atlantic Fleet.

On 4 June 1979, &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; ran aground in heavy fog at Race Rock while en route to New London, Connecticut. The submarine was able to free itself and proceed to port for inspection of the damage.

After several overhauls in the Charleston Naval Shipyard and 40 more deterrent patrols, &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for its final refueling overhaul in 1988. CDR Charles Peterson was relieved of both crews by CDR Glen Dilgren in August 1989. Hurricane Hugo struck on 21 September 1989 and resulted in a one-month shipyard shutdown. During the shutdown, crew members were assigned to help with recovery operations in the Charleston area, for which the ship was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal. During Alfa sea trials in June 1990 and as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; was directed to condense the crew, deactivate the missile systems and convert to an SSN. The ship was delivered for SSN Shakedown three months ahead of schedule.

During shakedown, the ship went 11-for-11 during AUTEC, WSAT and open ocean exercise torpedo firings against maneuvering targets.
The missile compartment was configured for support of Naval Special Warfare, and the ship passed its initial SSN Tactical Readiness Evaluation. Following shakedown, the ship was assigned to Submarine Squadron Four at Charleston, SC and won the White &quot;A&quot; for excellence in Anti-Submarine Warfare. &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; was assigned missions in Fleet and NATO Exercises, Atlantic SSN Operations and a primary tasking in the development of new submarine and Naval Special Warfare tactics. In September 1991, the ship was a key participant in Exercise Phantom Shadow, the largest ever Navy and Special Warfare exercise, which lasted a month in the Western Atlantic and Caribbean. In the spring of 1992, &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; conducted a successful MK 48 warshot SINKEX during her 30th underway since completion of overhaul two years before. CDR Glen Dilgren was relieved by CDR Marshall Page in April 1992. During her final years of service, the ship continued SSN operations in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Caribbean.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; was deactivated in September 1993. She was decommissioned on 1 September 1994 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Ex-&quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, on 26 September 1997. Recycling of Ex-&quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; was completed on 27 October 1998.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot;″s sail is preserved as part of the Deterrent Park monument at Naval Base Kitsap in Bangor, Washington.

<text>USS &quot;Henry Clay&quot; (SSBN-625), a ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Henry Clay (1777–1852), the American statesman and orator.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Henry Clay&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 3 February 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 23 October 1961. She was launched on 30 November 1962, sponsored by Mrs. Anna Gratz &quot;Nannie&quot; (Clay) Gibson, and commissioned on 20 February 1964, with Commander Thomas A Bryce in command of the Blue Crew and Commander John C. Lewis in command of the Gold Crew.

==Operational history==
&quot;Henry Clay&quot; conducted shakedown off the coast of Florida beginning on 28 February 1964. She completed her first submerged Polaris missile firing on 6 April 1964 and returned to Newport News on 29 May 1964. 

She then moved to her new home port, Charleston, South Carolina, and departed for her first deterrent patrol on 17 August 1964.

By January 1967, &quot;Henry Clay&quot; had completed 11 deterrent patrols. As of mid-1967, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 14.

During December 1986, &quot;Henry Clay&quot; made a port call at Plymouth, England, while being operated by her Gold crew, the only port call the Crew made between April 1985 and October 1987.

In 1987, &quot;Henry Clay&quot;″s Gold Crew underwent an unannounced Operational Reactor Safeguards Examination (ORSE). She received an EXCELLENT grade, the only submarine in the United States Atlantic Fleet other than the attack submarine up to that date to receive an EXCELLENT on an unannounced ORSE.

RECORD SETTING: In 1989, in preparation for its final deterrent patrol, the &quot;Henry Clay&quot; crew spent just three days in Holy Loch, Scotland for its refit (instead of the normal three week refit period), and onloaded 250,000 pounds of food. &quot;Henry Clay&quot; spent a record 121 days (April–August) beneath the North Atlantic waves on deterrent patrol. It made two, short back to back port calls in Plymouth and Portsmouth, England respectively. After its successful patrol, the &quot;Henry Clay&quot; pulled into Norfolk, VA for a brief rest and to pick up many of the crew&#x27;s (male) family members for a three-day, fun &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; to her home port of Charleston, South Carolina.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Henry Clay&quot; was decommissioned on 5 November 1990 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, for scrapping, which was completed on 30 September 1997.

<doc id="952672" wikidata="Q507854" url="?curid=952672" title="Karlstadt am Main">
<text>Karlstadt is a town in the Main-Spessart in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany. It is the administrative centre of Main-Spessart (&quot;Kreisstadt&quot;), and has a population of around 15,000.

==Geography==
Karlstadt lies on the River Main in the district (Landkreis) of Main-Spessart, roughly 25 km north of the city of Würzburg. It belongs to the Main-Franconian wine-growing region. The town itself is located on the right bank of the river, but the municipal territory extends to the left bank.

Since the amalgamations in 1978, Karlstadt&#x27;s &quot;Stadtteile&quot; have been Gambach, Heßlar, Karlburg, Karlstadt, Laudenbach, Mühlbach, Rohrbach, Stadelhofen, Stetten, and Wiesenfeld.

==History==
From the late 6th to the mid-13th century, the settlement of Karlburg with its monastery and harbor was located on the west bank of the Main. It grew up around the Karlsburg, a castle perched high over the community, that was destroyed in the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525.

In 1202, Karlstadt itself was founded by Konrad von Querfurt, Bishop of Würzburg. The town was methodically laid out with a nearly rectangular plan to defend Würzburg territory against the Counts of Rieneck. The plan is still well preserved today. The streets in the old town are laid out much like a chessboard, but for military reasons they are not quite straight.

In 1225, Karlstadt had its first documentary mention. In 1236, the castle and the village of Karlburg were destroyed in the Rieneck Feud. In 1244, winegrowing in Karlstadt was mentioned for the first time. From 1277 comes the earliest evidence of the town seal. In 1304, the town fortifications were finished. The parish of Karlstadt was first named in 1339. In 1369 a hospital was founded. Between 1370 and 1515, remodelling work was being done on the first, Romanesque parish church to turn it into a Gothic hall church. About 1400, Karlstadt became for a short time the seat of an episcopal mint. The former &quot;Oberamt&quot; of the Princely Electorate (&quot;Hochstift&quot;) of Würzburg was, after Secularization, in Bavaria&#x27;s favour, passed in 1805 to Grand Duke Ferdinando III of Tuscany to form the Grand Duchy of Würzburg, and passed with this to the Kingdom of Bavaria.

The Jewish residents of the town had a synagogue as early as the Middle Ages. The town&#x27;s synagogue was destroyed on &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (the Night of Broken Glass, 9 November 1938) by Nazi SA men, SS, and Hitler Youth, as well as other local residents. Its destruction is recalled by a plaque at the synagogue&#x27;s former site. The homes of Jewish residents were attacked as well, the possessions therein were looted or brought to the square in front of the town hall where they were burned, and the Jews living in the town were beaten.

==Governance==
The mayor of Karlstadt is Michael Hombach (CSU), elected in 2020.

The council is made up of 24 council members, excluding the mayor.

(as of 2 March 2008)

The town&#x27;s coat of arms might be described thus: Quarterly, first and fourth azure, second and third argent a fleur-de-lis gules. The town&#x27;s earliest seal, from 1277, showed an effigy of Charlemagne, who is said to have founded and named the town (Charlemagne is called &quot;Karl der Große&quot; in German). The next seal after this one also bore Charlemagne&#x27;s likeness, and this appeared on town seals until the 18th century. However, in 1544 the town began using a quartered shield as its arms. This is thought to have come from the banner of state borne by the Prince-Bishopric (Hochstift) of Würzburg, to which the town once belonged. The fleurs-de-lis were added in the early 19th century, and they refer to Charlemagne.

==Transport==
* Karlstadt lies at the junction of two &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot;, the B 26 and the B 27. On two road bridges, the Old Main Bridge (&quot;Alte Mainbrücke&quot;) built in 1953 and the more northerly New Main Bridge (&quot;Neue Mainbrücke&quot;) built in 2005, the river Main can be crossed.
* Through the municipal area runs the Hanover-Würzburg high-speed rail line, north-south. Within the municipal territory lie a section of the Mühlberg Tunnel and part of the Nantenbach Curve.
* Karlstadt has a small airfield east of the town.

==Economy==

Local industry includes Düker Ironworks, the Schwenk Cement Works, and the Kohl Wood Veneer Factory. Besides these three large industrial plants, many handicraft businesses have also set up shop in Karlstadt. Another big employer is the Main-Spessart &quot;Landratsamt&quot; (district administration). Many inhabitants commute to Würzburg, 25 km away, or Lohr am Main, 18 km away.

Winegrowing has only a small economic importance nowadays, but still has great cultural significance. Vineyards in Karlstadt are the Roßtal and Im Stein. There are also others in centres, especially in Stetten (Stettener Stein) and on the way from the main town out to Gambach.

==Education==
In 1999 the following institutions existed in Karlstadt:

* Kindergartens: 549 places with 548 children
* Primary schools: 5 with 63 teachers and 1,147 pupils
* Gymnasium: 1 with 60 teachers and 923 students
* Realschule with just under 600 students (in 2004)
* “Piranha” youth cultural centre: 1,000 visitors each year

<doc id="952677" wikidata="Q574291" url="?curid=952677" title="Backlight">
<text>A backlight is a form of illumination used in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) that provides illumination from the back or side of a display panel. LCDs do not produce light by themselves, so they need illumination (ambient light or a special light source) to produce a visible image. Backlights are often used in smartphones, computer monitors, and LCD televisions. They are used in small displays to increase readability in low light conditions such as in wristwatches. Typical sources of light for backlights include light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs).

Simple types of LCDs such as those used in pocket calculators are built without an internal light source, requiring external light sources to convey the display image to the user. Most LCD screens, however, are built with an internal light source. Such screens consist of several layers. The backlight is usually the first layer from the back. Light valves then vary the amount of light reaching the eye, by blocking its passage in some way. Most use a fixed polarizing filter and a switching one, to block the undesired light.

Many types of displays other than LCD generate their own light and do not require a backlight, for example, OLED displays, cathode-ray tube (CRT), and plasma (PDP) displays.

A similar type of technology is called a frontlight, which illuminates an LCD from the front.

A review of some early backlighting schemes for LCDs is given in a report &quot;Engineering and Technology History&quot; by Peter J. Wild.

== Light source types ==
The light source can be made up of:
* Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
* An electroluminescent panel (ELP)
* Cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs)
* Hot cathode fluorescent lamps (HCFLs)
* External electrode fluorescent lamps (EEFLs)
* Formerly, incandescent lightbulbs

An ELP gives off uniform light over its entire surface, but other backlights frequently employ a diffuser to provide even lighting from an uneven source.

Backlights come in many colors. Monochrome LCDs typically have yellow, green, blue, or white backlights, while color displays use white backlights that cover most of the color spectrum.

==Usage==
Colored LED backlighting is most commonly used in small, inexpensive LCD panels. White LED backlighting is becoming dominant. ELP backlighting is often used for larger displays or when even backlighting is important; it can also be either colored or white. An ELP must be driven by relatively high voltage AC power, which is provided by an inverter circuit. CCFL backlights are used on larger displays such as computer monitors, and are typically white in color; these also require the use of an inverter and diffuser. Incandescent backlighting was used by early LCD panels to achieve high brightness, but the limited life and excess heat produced by incandescent bulbs were severe limitations. The heat generated by incandescent bulbs typically requires the bulbs to be mounted away from the display to prevent damage.

===CCFL backlights===
For several years (until about 2010), the preferred backlight for matrix-addressed large LCD panels such as in monitors and TVs was based on a cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) by using two CCFLs at opposite edges of the LCD or by an array of CCFLs behind the LCD (see picture of an array with 18 CCFLs for a 40-inch LCD TV). Due to the disadvantages in comparison with LED illumination (higher voltage and power needed, thicker panel design, no high-speed switching, faster aging), LED backlighting is becoming more popular.

Many LCD models, from cheap TN-displays to color proofing S-IPS or S-PVA panels, have wide gamut CCFLs representing more than 95% of the NTSC color specification.

===LED backlights===

LED backlighting in color screens comes in two varieties: white LED backlights and RGB LED backlights. White LEDs are used most often in notebook computers and desktop screens, and make up virtually all mobile LCD screens. A white LED is typically a blue LED with broad spectrum yellow phosphor to result in the emission of white light. However, because the spectral curve peaks at yellow, it is a poor match to the transmission peaks of the red and green color filters of the LCD. This causes the red and green primaries to shift toward yellow, reducing the color gamut of the display. RGB LEDs consist of a red, a blue, and a green LED and can be controlled to produce different color temperatures of white. RGB LEDs for backlighting are found in high end color proofing displays such as the HP DreamColor LP2480zx monitor or selected HP EliteBook notebooks, as well as more recent consumer-grade displays such as Dell&#x27;s Studio series laptops which have an optional RGB LED display.

RGB LEDs can deliver an enormous color gamut to screens. When using three separate LEDs (additive color) the backlight can produce a color spectrum that closely matches the color filters in the LCD pixels themselves. In this way, the filter passband can be narrowed so that each color component lets only a very narrow band of spectrum through the LCD. This improves the efficiency of the display since less light is blocked when white is displayed. The actual red, green, and blue points can be moved farther out so that the display is capable of reproducing more vivid colors.

A method to further improve the color gamut of LED-backlit LCD panels is based on blue LEDs (such as gallium nitride (GaN) LEDs) that illuminate a layer of nanocrystal phosphors, called quantum dots (QDs). The quantum dots convert the blue wavelengths to the desired longer wavelengths as narrow-bandwidth green and red colors for optimal illumination of the LCD from behind. The manufacturer, Nanosys, claims that the color output of the dots can be tuned precisely by controlling the size of the nanocrystals. Other companies pursuing this method are Nanoco Group PLC (UK), QD Vision, 3M a licensee of Nanosys and Avantama of Switzerland.
Sony has adapted quantum dot technology from the US company QD Vision to introduce LCD TVs with an improved &quot;edge-lit&quot; LED backlight marketed under the term &quot;Triluminos&quot; in 2013. With a blue LED and optimized nanocrystals for green and red colors in front of it, the resulting combined white light allows for an equivalent or better color gamut than that emitted by a more expensive set of three RGB LEDs. At the Consumer Electronics Show 2015, a number of companies showed QD-enhanced LED-backlighting of LCD TVs, including Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, and the Chinese TCL Corporation.

There are several challenges with LED backlights. Uniformity is hard to achieve, especially as the LEDs age, with each LED aging at a different rate. The use of three separate light sources for red, green, and blue means that the white point of the display can move as the LEDs age at different rates; white LEDs are affected by this phenomenon, with changes of several hundred kelvins of color temperature being recorded. White LEDs suffer from blue shifts at higher temperatures varying from 3141K to 3222K for 10 °C to 80 °C respectively. Power efficiency may be a challenge; first generation implementations could potentially use more power than their CCFL counterparts, though it is possible for an LED display to be more power efficient. In 2010, current generation LED displays can have significant power consumption advantages. For example, the non-LED version of the 24&quot; Benq G2420HDB consumer display has a 49W consumption compared to the 24W of the LED version of the same display (G2420HDBL).

To overcome the aforementioned challenges with RGB and white LED backlights an &#x27;advanced remote phosphor&#x27; LED technology has been developed by NDF Special Light Products, specifically for high-end and long-life LCD applications such as cockpit displays, air traffic control displays, and medical displays. This technology uses blue pump LEDs in combination with a sheet on which phosphorous luminescent materials are printed for colour conversion. The principle is similar to quantum dots, but the phosphors applied are much more robust than the quantum dot nano-particles for applications that require long lifetime in more demanding operational conditions. Because the phosphor sheet is placed at a distance (remote) of the LED it experiences much less temperature stress than phosphors in white LEDs. As a result, the white point is less dependent on individual LEDs, and degrading of individual LEDs over lifetime, leading to a more homogenous backlight with improved colour consistency and lower lumen depreciation.

The use of LED backlights in notebook computers has been growing. Sony has used LED backlights in some of its higher-end slim VAIO notebooks since 2005, and Fujitsu introduced notebooks with LED backlights in 2006. In 2007, Asus, Dell, and Apple introduced LED backlights into some of their notebook models. , Lenovo has announced LED-backlit notebooks. In October 2008, Apple announced that it would be using LED backlights for all of its notebooks and new 24-inch Apple Cinema Display, and one year later it introduced a new LED iMac, meaning all of Apple&#x27;s new computer screens became LED-backlit displays. Almost every laptop with a 16:9 display introduced since September 2009 uses LED-backlit panels. This is also the case for most LCD television sets, which are marketed in some countries under the misleading name &quot;LED TV&quot;, although the image is still generated by an LCD panel.

Most LED backlights for LCDs are &quot;edge-lit&quot;, i.e. several LEDs are placed at the edges of a lightguide (Light guide plate, LGP), which distributes the light behind the LC panel. Advantages of this technique are the very thin flat-panel construction and low cost. A more expensive version is called &quot;full-array&quot; or &quot;direct&quot; LED and consists of many LEDs placed behind the LC panel (an &quot;array&quot; of LEDs), such that large panels can be evenly illuminated. Full-array local dimming is often abbreviated as &quot;FALD&quot;. This arrangement allows for &quot;local dimming&quot; to obtain darker &quot;black&quot; pixels depending on the image displayed.

====Backlight dimming====
LED backlight are often dynamically controlled using the video information (dynamic backlight control or dynamic &quot;local dimming&quot; LED backlight, also marketed as HDR, high dynamic range television, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan).

Using PWM (pulse-width modulation, a technology where the intensity of the LEDs are kept constant, but the brightness adjustment is achieved by varying a time interval of flashing these constant light intensity light sources), the backlight is dimmed to the brightest color that appears on the screen while simultaneously boosting the LCD contrast to the maximum achievable levels

If the frequency of the pulse-width modulation is too low or the user is very sensitive to flicker, this may cause discomfort and eye-strain, similar to the flicker of CRT displays. This can be tested by a user simply by waving a hand or object in front of the screen. If the object appears to have sharply defined edges as it moves, the backlight is strobing on and off at a fairly low frequency. If the object appears blurry, the display either has a continuously illuminated backlight or is operating the backlight at a frequency higher than the brain can perceive. The flicker can be reduced or eliminated by setting the display to full brightness, though this may have a negative impact on image quality and battery life due to increased power consumption.

==Diffusers==
For a non-ELP backlight to produce even lighting, which is critical for displays, the light is first passed through a lightguide (Light guide plate, LGP) - a specially designed layer of plastic that diffuses the light through a series of unevenly spaced bumps. The density of bumps increases further away from the light source according to a diffusion equation. The diffused light then travels to either side of the diffuser; the front faces the actual LCD panel, the back has a reflector to guide otherwise wasted light back toward the LCD panel. The reflector is sometimes made of aluminum foil or a simple white-pigmented surface.

==Reflective polarizers==
The LCD backlight systems are made highly efficient by applying optical films such as prismatic structure to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. These polarizers consist of a large stack of uniaxial oriented birefringent films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light. Such reflective polarizers using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic backlight control make today&#x27;s LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.

==Power consumption==
The evolution of energy standards and the increasing public expectations regarding power consumption have made it necessary for backlight systems to manage their power. As for other consumer electronics products (e.g., fridges or light bulbs), energy consumption categories are enforced for television sets. Standards for power ratings for TV sets have been introduced, e.g., in the USA, EU, and Australia as well as in China. Moreover, a 2008 study showed that among European countries, power consumption is one of the most important criteria for consumers when they choose a television, as important as the screen size.

<doc id="952682" wikidata="Q1150713" url="?curid=952682" title="Summer of Sam">
<text>Summer of Sam is a 1999 American crime thriller film about the 1977 David Berkowitz (Son of Sam) serial murders and their effect on a group of fictional residents of an Italian-American neighborhood in The Bronx in the late 1970s. It focuses on two young men from the neighborhood: Vinny (John Leguizamo), whose marriage is faltering due to his cheating, and Ritchie (Adrien Brody), Vinny&#x27;s childhood friend who has embraced punk fashion and music.

The murder investigation and other contemporary events, such as the New York City blackout of 1977 and the New York Yankees&#x27; winning season, provide a backdrop to the stories of Vinny, Ritchie, their families and friends. The film was directed and co-produced by Spike Lee, who also co-wrote the film with Michael Imperioli and Victor Colicchio. The film was a box-office disappointment.

==Plot==
It is the summer of 1977, and New York City lives in fear of the &quot;.44 Caliber Killer&quot;, who shoots young women and their male companions. The killer, David Berkowitz, later identifies himself as &quot;Son of Sam&quot; in a note left at a murder scene. Berkowitz lives in a messy apartment, where he is driven crazy by the barking of a neighbor&#x27;s large black labrador, Harvey, the dog of Sam Carr, and has a vision of the dog directing him to kill.

In an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx (likely Morris Park, Throggs Neck, or Pelham Bay), hairdresser Vinny and his pretty wife Dionna go disco dancing at a local nightclub, where they meet Dionna&#x27;s attractive cousin Chiara. Vinny offers to drive Chiara home while Dionna remains at the club. Vinny and Chiara then park on a residential street and have sex in the car. Son of Sam watches them, but when another couple pulls up behind their car, flashing their lights and honking their horn, Vinny and Chiara drive off, embarrassed. After they leave, Son of Sam kills the couple who had parked behind Vinny. When Vinny picks up Dionna back at the club, she notices the smell of vaginal lubrication on his face and realizes he had sex with Chiara but does not let on that she knows.

On the drive home, Vinny notices police near the location where he had parked with Chiara and sees the bodies of the slain couple. The religious and guilty Vinny, realizing he could have been a victim, decides that God spared him in order to give him a chance to reform his ways and stop cheating on his wife. Although Vinny loves Dionna, their sex life is suffering because Vinny enjoys anal sex, &quot;69&quot; and other sex acts that he considers kinky, but which he cannot bring himself to discuss or perform with his wife. He is also having an affair with Gloria, the owner of the hair salon where he works.

The next day, while Vinny is hanging out with neighborhood drug dealer Joey T and his friends, Vinny&#x27;s old friend Ritchie, who has been away for some time, reappears, sporting a punk spiked hairdo and clothing and affecting a British accent. Vinny, Joey T, and the others dislike the change in Ritchie and he soon finds himself unwelcome in the neighborhood. Ruby, a promiscuous local girl, is attracted to Ritchie and the two begin a relationship. Unlike other men, Ritchie takes an interest in Ruby as a person, not just as a sexual outlet. She learns that he makes money by erotic dancing and prostituting himself at a gay theater but remains loyal to him and begins to dress in punk fashion herself.

As the Son of Sam killings continue, tension rises in the neighborhood. A local police detective asks the local mob boss to help him find the killer; Joey T and his friends also make a list of possible suspects, including Ritchie whom they regard as &quot;a freak&quot;. Ritchie and Ruby invite Vinny and Dionna to come see their punk band perform at CBGB, but once there, Dionna feels intimidated by the punk crowd and refuses to go in. Vinny and Dionna instead go to Studio 54, where they are denied entry and finally end up at Plato&#x27;s Retreat where they take drugs and participate in an orgy. Vinny becomes upset when he sees Dionna appearing to enjoy the experience of having sex with another man, even though he himself is having sex with other women. He berates Dionna in the car on the way home, resulting in his angered wife revealing that she knows he cheated on her with Chiara. She storms off to stay at her father&#x27;s house. Vinny begins to drink, uses drugs and makes a scene at Gloria&#x27;s hair salon, causing her to angrily throw him out and then inform Dionna about their affair. Upon hearing from Gloria, Dionna leaves Vinny for good.

Joey T and his gang decide that the latest witness sketch of Son of Sam released by the police resembles Ritchie and attempt to track him down at CBGB. Joey persuades the unstable Vinny, who is high on drugs he has taken to dull the pain of his impending divorce, to help them lure Ritchie out of his house, since Vinny is the only local friend Ritchie still trusts. Unbeknownst to Vinny and his friends, the police have already arrested David Berkowitz, the real Son of Sam. Vinny goes to Ritchie&#x27;s family home, where Ritchie and Ruby are packing up to leave town, and lures Ritchie out on the pretext of talking about his failing marriage. Once Ritchie is outside, Vinny warns Ritchie under his breath to run, but Ritchie does not heed the warning and is attacked and severely beaten by Joey T and his gang. Ritchie&#x27;s stepfather, Eddie, emerges from the house brandishing his gun and rescues the badly injured Ritchie, telling the attackers that Ritchie is not the Son of Sam and that the TV news is reporting that the police have just arrested the real killer. Unable to face Ritchie, Vinny walks away.

==Cast==
==Production==
Spike Lee spent months trying to convince Leonardo DiCaprio to take the role of Ritchie. DiCaprio declined the role and Adrien Brody was cast as Ritchie. Lee later stated The role of Dionna was originally written with Jennifer Esposito in mind. A cast reshuffle ended with Mira Sorvino as Dionna and Esposito as Ruby. Journalist Jimmy Breslin, to whom the real Son of Sam sent letters during the time of the murders, appears as himself introducing and closing the film. Phil Rizzuto appears in the film as the Yankees&#x27; broadcaster and boxer Evander Holyfield makes a brief appearance as a man in a riot.

The film was largely shot during the summer of 1998 and set in the Italian-American neighborhoods of Country Club, Morris Park and Throggs Neck sections of the Bronx, with some scenes filmed in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Although most of the Son of Sam murders actually took place in Queens, the double shooting that Vinny narrowly escapes has been called an accurate depiction of the April 1977 killing of Alexander Esau and Valentina Suriani in the Bronx. Marie&#x27;s Beauty Lounge, the salon where Vinny works, was a real salon on Morris Park Avenue, between Williamsbridge Road and Bronxdale Avenue. The real CBGB club was also used; the band L.E.S. Stitches shown playing there was a contemporary punk band from New York&#x27;s Lower East Side.

Adrien Brody&#x27;s nose was broken during the climactic fight scene in which his character Ritchie is brutally beaten by his friends. The sex orgy scene at Plato&#x27;s Retreat included more explicit shots in the original cut but was edited after the MPAA threatened the film with an &quot;NC-17&quot; rating.

==Reception==
&quot;Summer of Sam&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 1999, and was released in the United States on July 2. It received mixed reviews from critics. The film has an approval rating of 50% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 104 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.50/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Spike Lee offers intense visuals but his storytelling feels crowded and overambitious&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade D− on scale of A to F.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated &quot;Lee is a powerful filmmaker who certainly knows how to have an impact on an audience, but those who survive his ministrations are likely to wonder if in this case the battle was worth the bruises&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a positive review, writing the film &quot;is the closest Lee has yet come to Scorsese territory.&quot; In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars and regarded the screenplay as more of &quot;an analytical outsider&#x27;s view&quot; of provincial scapegoating rather than &quot;the inside, autobiographical job of a Martin Scorsese film&quot;. He added &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; &quot;vibrates with fear, guilt and lust&quot;, and that the film is &quot;not about the killer, but about his victims—not those he murdered, but those whose overheated imaginations bloomed into a lynch mob mentality. There is a sequence near the end of the film that shows a side of human nature as ugly as it is familiar: the fever to find someone to blame and the need to blame someone who is different.&quot;

According to film academic R. Barton Palmer in 2011, &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; continues to be widely viewed as Spike Lee&#x27;s most controversial film, &quot;issuing a cynical appeal to trashy tastes&quot;, which has &quot;prevented some critics from according it more than cursory consideration&quot;. Many critics objected to its handling of sexual themes, its pervasive street language, and &quot;what some saw as [Lee&#x27;s] bitterly negative and even defamatory representations of white ethnic culture&quot;.

<text>Patricia Mauceri (born April 7, 1950) is an American actress. She is best known for playing the role of Carlotta Vega on the ABC soap opera, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Mauceri was born in Brooklyn, New York. She played Angie Perrini Frame on &quot;Another World&quot; in 1977. She has had small roles in films such as &quot;Saving Grace&quot; and &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, and appeared in television shows such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

Mauceri portrayed Carlotta Vega on the ABC soap opera, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1995 until March 25, 2009. She was reportedly replaced in the role after voicing personal religious objections to a planned storyline in which Carlotta would be supportive of a gay relationship.

Mauceri has served on the theatre faculty of the MasterWorks Festival since 2005.

A short documentary about Mauceri was filmed by Olive Tree Pictures. In 2017 she portrayed Jenny Sanchez in the faith-based movie &quot;Courageous Love&quot;.

<doc id="952699" wikidata="Q3047380" url="?curid=952699" title="Eddy Wally">
<text>Eduard Van De Walle (12 July 1932 – 6 February 2016), known by his stage name Eddy Wally, was a Belgian schlager singer and actor from Zelzate, East Flanders, and the once self-proclaimed &quot;Voice of Europe&quot;.

As a crooner and showman, Eddy Wally toured worldwide, including China, Australia, all of Europe, the United States, and the USSR. As Eddy Wally was short, he tended to use outside chairs in his act.

Eddy Wally was best known for his song &quot;Chérie&quot; which became a double-platinum hit. Wally was also known for &quot;Ik spring uit een vliegmachien&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll jump out of an aeroplane&quot;), and &quot;Dans Mi Amor&quot;.

==Attire and cultural iconography==
On and off stage, Wally usually wore flashy, shiny, expensive outfits, characterized by a camp and kitsch style reminiscent of Liberace. In 2004, Eddy Wally&#x27;s wardrobe was acquired by the Stedelijk Modemuseum van Hasselt, and was displayed under the title &quot;Eddy Wally&#x27;s Geweldige Garderobe&quot;. The exhibition comprised 115 custom made outfits, valued at up to $5,300 apiece.

In October 2009, famed Belgian artist Kamagurka proclaimed:

It&#x27;s still discussed whether or not Eddy Wally was a stereotype. Jan Van Rompaey, a former host of many human interest programs and talkshows on Belgian television, interviewed Wally many times. According to him, Wally had a limited vocabulary and was not a stereotype, although he exaggerated his eccentricity. Kamagurka reached a similar conclusion and insinuated Wally acted strange &quot;because people expected this from a famous person&quot;. Kamagurka also revealed Wally had some kind of dyslexia and wrote all of his lyrics in his own phonetic transcription language. Wally also had trouble learning scripted lines, even the most simple ones.

Wally was also known for a video posted on YouTube in 2007 by a person from the community of him exclaiming &quot;Wow&quot; and winking. This had gained worldwide recognition and had become a meme, which many other YouTube users began to use in their videos for comedy.

At some point in time, the novelist Deborah Bishop was writing a biography of Wally, entitled &quot;Wow!&quot;.

==Background==
Eddy Wally&#x27;s first job was a market trader selling handbags. In the 1960s, he became popular after his association with Dutch producer Johnny Hoes. He even had his own disco &quot;Chérie-Paris Las Vegas&quot;, first known as &quot;Eddy Wally&#x27;s Texas Bar&quot;.

Eddy Wally used to be a regular feature on the UK television programme &quot;Eurotrash&quot;, where he was renowned for his eccentric dress sense.

==Honours==
* A main-belt asteroid is named after Eddy Wally (9205 Eddywally). It is in orbit around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter.
* Knight of the Order of Leopold, by Royal Decree of 2005.

==Death==
Eddy Wally died on 6 February 2016, aged 83, following a stroke.

<text>The Luxembourg Grand Prix () was the name given to two races of the FIA Formula One World Championship, held in 1997 and 1998. Both races were held in Germany at the Nürburgring, which is located some from the Germany–Luxembourg border.

The Luxembourg title was chosen in 1997 despite the race being held in Germany and not in Luxembourg&#x27;s own territory as the Hockenheimring was already contracted to host the German Grand Prix. The Nürburgring had previously hosted the European Grand Prix in 1995 and 1996, but it was renamed due to other changes in the 1997 schedule. Following the cancellation of the Portuguese Grand Prix, a second race in Spain was added, with Jerez hosting the European Grand Prix along with the Spanish Grand Prix at Barcelona. Jerez was due to host the race again in 1998, but the rights to the European Grand Prix had been revoked from the organisers of the race after an incident on the podium in 1997. In 1999 the Nürburgring race returned to using the European Grand Prix title, which it held every year until 2007.

== History ==

=== 1997 ===
As it was, the Luxembourg Grand Prix provided a moment in history, as Renault-powered cars took the first four places at the finish with Jacques Villeneuve (Williams-Renault) taking first place. The race was also Villeneuve&#x27;s final Formula One victory.

For a long time it looked as if Mika Häkkinen would take his first Formula One win as he pulled away at the front from his McLaren teammate David Coulthard. However, in the space of one lap, both McLarens had pulled out of the race with blown engines allowing Villeneuve to move close to an eventual World Championship. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s race was over by the end of the first lap after his brother Ralf Schumacher collided with his teammate Giancarlo Fisichella at the first corner; this caused immediate retirement for three out of the four cars involved (Ralf, Fisichella, and Ukyo Katayama), and also caused suspension damage to the fourth car (Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari) which also led to its retirement two laps later.

=== 1998 ===
1998 saw Mika Häkkinen gain revenge for his engine failure at the previous race by taking victory at this one, with Michael Schumacher second despite qualifying on pole, and Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate Coulthard third. Häkkinen also, like Villeneuve the year prior, went on to win the World Championship in the final race of the season at Suzuka; this meant that every winner of the Luxembourg GP went on to win that year&#x27;s World Championship.

<doc id="952702" wikidata="Q239835" url="?curid=952702" title="Anthurium">
<text>Anthurium (; Schott, 1829) is a genus of about 1,000 species of flowering plants, the largest genus of the arum family, Araceae. General common names include anthurium, tailflower, flamingo flower, pigtail plant, and laceleaf.

The genus is native to the Americas, where it is distributed from northern Mexico to northern Argentina and parts of the Caribbean.

== Description and biology ==
&quot;Anthurium&quot; is a genus of herbs often growing as epiphytes on other plants. Some are terrestrial. The leaves are often clustered and are variable in shape. The inflorescence bears small flowers which are perfect, containing male and female structures. The flowers are contained in close together spirals on the spadix. The spadix is often elongated into a spike shape, but it can be globe-shaped or club-shaped. Beneath the spadix is the spathe, a type of bract. This is variable in shape, as well, but it is lance-shaped in many species. It may extend out flat or in a curve. Sometimes it covers the spadix like a hood. The fruits develop from the flowers on the spadix. They are juicy berries varying in color, usually containing two seeds.

The spadix and spathe are a main focus of &quot;Anthurium&quot; breeders, who develop cultivars in bright colors and unique shapes. &quot;Anthurium scherzerianum&quot; and &quot;A. andraeanum&quot;, two of the most common taxa in cultivation, are the only species that grow bright red spathes. They have also been bred to produce spathes in many other colors and patterns.

&quot;Anthurium&quot; plants are poisonous due to calcium oxalate crystals. The sap is irritating to the skin and eyes.

== Cultivation ==

Like other aroids, many species of &quot;Anthurium&quot; plant can be grown as houseplants, or outdoors in mild climates in shady spots, including &quot;Anthurium crystallinum&quot; and &quot;Anthurium clarinervium&quot; with its large, velvety, dark green leaves and silvery white venation. Many hybrids are derived from &quot;Anthurium andraeanum&quot; or &quot;Anthurium scherzerianum&quot; because of their colorful spathes. They thrive in moist soils with high organic matter. In milder climates the plants can be grown in pots of soil. Indoors plants thrive at temperatures of and at lower light than other house plants. Wiping the leaves off with water will remove any dust and insects. Plants in pots with good root systems will benefit from a weak fertilizer solution every other week. In the case of vining or climbing Anthuriums, the plants benefit from being provided with a totem to climb.

=== Propagation===
&quot;Anthurium&quot; can be propagated by seed or vegetatively by cuttings. In the commercial &quot;Anthurium&quot; trade, most propagation is via tissue culture.

== Species ==
For a full list, see the List of &quot;Anthurium&quot; species.
In 1860 there were 183 species known to science, and Heinrich Wilhelm Schott defined them in 28 sections in the book &quot;Prodromus Systematis Aroidearum&quot;. In 1905 the genus was revised with a description of 18 sections. In 1983 the genus was divided into the following sections:

* &quot;Belolonchium&quot;
* &quot;Calomystrium&quot;
* &quot;Cardiolonchium&quot;
* &quot;Chamaerepium&quot;
* &quot;Cordatopunctatum&quot;
* &quot;Dactylophyllium&quot;
* &quot;Decurrentia&quot;
* &quot;Digitinervium&quot;
* &quot;Gymnopodium&quot;
* &quot;Leptanthurium&quot;
* &quot;Pachyneurium&quot;
* &quot;Polyphyllium&quot;
* &quot;Polyneurium&quot;
* &quot;Porphyrochitonium&quot;
* &quot;Schizoplacium&quot;
* &quot;Semaeophyllium&quot;
* &quot;Tetraspermium&quot;
* &quot;Urospadix&quot;
* &quot;Xialophyllium&quot;

== Gallery ==
== Toxicity ==
* All plants within the Anthurium genus are toxic to cats, dogs, and even horses. Each part of the plant, including the root, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds, poses a risk of toxicity. The plant contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause oral irritation, pain, swelling, excessive drooling, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing. Keeping these plants away from your pets (and equines) is the best way to prevent a medical emergency.

<doc id="952703" wikidata="Q1197791" url="?curid=952703" title="Like Father, Like Clown">
<text>&quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; is the sixth episode of the third season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on October 24, 1991. In the episode, Krusty the Clown reveals to the Simpsons that he is Jewish and that his father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky, kicked him out for pursuing a career in comedy. Bart and Lisa try to reunite a heartbroken Krusty with his estranged father.

The episode was written by the duo of Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, and directed by Jeffrey Lynch and Brad Bird; as it was Lynch&#x27;s first credit as a director, Bird was assigned to help him. Krusty&#x27;s religion had not been part of the original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody the 1927 film &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and establish that Krusty is Jewish. The episode was carefully researched and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and Harold M. Schulweis, were credited as &quot;special technical consultants&quot;. Comedian Jackie Mason, who had once been an ordained rabbi, provided the voice of Hyman Krustofsky. Hyman later became an infrequently recurring character voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Mason returned to voice the character in several later episodes.

In its original broadcast, &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; finished 34th in ratings with a Nielsen rating of 12.7. Mason won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Hyman Krustofsky.

==Plot==
Krusty had agreed to have dinner with the Simpsons to repay Bart for helping exonerate him for charges of armed robbery. When he keeps canceling, an upset Bart writes him a letter saying he has lost faith in Krusty. Krusty&#x27;s secretary, Lois Pennycandy, is so moved by the letter that she threatens to quit if Krusty does not keep his promise to Bart, so Krusty reluctantly attends. When asked to say grace, Krusty recites a Hebrew blessing. Realizing that Krusty is Jewish, Lisa speaks of his heritage, making him break down in tears. He tells the family that saying the blessing reminds him of his troubled past.

Krusty reveals his real name is Herschel Krustofsky () and describes his upbringing on the Lower East Side of Springfield. His father, Hyman Krustofsky, is a rabbi who hated his son&#x27;s wish to become a comedian and wanted him to follow in his footsteps. At school, Krusty made the other students laugh and became a slapstick comedian behind his father&#x27;s back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbis&#x27; convention unknowingly attended by Hyman. A rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Recognizing Krusty, an outraged Hyman immediately disowned his son. They have not seen or spoken to each other in 25 years.

While filming an episode of &quot;The Krusty the Klown Show&quot;, Krusty is reduced to tears on-camera after showing a father-and-son themed episode of &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot;. Lisa says “A man who envies our family is a man who needs help” and she and Bart decide to reunite father and son. Hyman tells them: &quot;I have no son!&quot; and Bart says &quot;Great, we came all this way and it&#x27;s the wrong guy.&quot; He adds: &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean that literally!&quot; He refuses to reconcile with Krusty because he believes that his son had abandoned his faith and family. To outsmart Hyman, Lisa finds Judaic teachings that urge forgiveness, but he refutes her arguments. In a last-ditch effort, Bart convinces Hyman to abandon his stubborn ways by quoting Sammy Davis Jr. — a Jewish entertainer like Krusty — and making a passionate plea about the struggles that the Jewish people have overcome. Bart&#x27;s speech finally convinces Hyman that entertainers have a place in Jewish culture.

Krusty is feeling glum when he starts the live of his show, and then calls for &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; to roll. Bart and Lisa arrive backstage with Hyman, and he and Krusty joyously reconcile before the audience. Hyman accepts a cream pie from Bart and throws it in his son&#x27;s face.

==Production==
&quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; was written by the duo of Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Krusty&#x27;s religion had not been part of the original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and establish that Krusty is Jewish. They pitched the idea to co-executive producer Sam Simon, who rejected it, but it was approved by James L. Brooks. Krusty&#x27;s last name, Krustofsky, was established in this episode as pitched by Al Jean. The portion of the episode where characters quote the Bible in support or opposition of clowning were carefully researched. Cited passages from the Bible include Exodus 20:12 and Joshua 1:8. The quotations from the Talmud were also researched, and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and Harold M. Schulweis, were credited as &quot;special technical consultants&quot;. Schulweis was asked to take a look at a draft of the script. While not a fan of the show, he felt &quot;it was profound&quot; and added some corrections. He later commented, &quot;I thought it had a Jewish resonance to it. I was impressed by the underlying moral seriousness.&quot;

The episode was co-directed by Jeffrey Lynch and Brad Bird. It was Lynch&#x27;s first credit as a director, so Bird was assigned to help him out and &quot;usher [Lynch] into the world of directing things quickly&quot;. Krusty is one of Bird&#x27;s favorite characters, and he always tries to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.

Rabbi Krustofsky was voiced by Jackie Mason, who had once been an ordained rabbi, but had resigned to become a comedian. Mason recorded his lines in New York City, and Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Krusty, went there to record with him. In the script, Bart and Lisa try to trick Rabbi Krustofsky into meeting with Krusty by arranging a lunch date between him and Saul Bellow, the &quot;Nobel Prize-winning Jewish novelist&quot;. Originally, this was intended to be Isaac Bashevis Singer, but the writers change it when Singer died, and Mason had to re-record his lines to accommodate the alteration. Rabbi Krustofsky became an infrequently recurring character, and his occasional speaking parts were voiced by Castellaneta. Mason later returned to voice the rabbi in &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot; in the fifteenth season, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Springfield&quot; in the twenty-first season, and &quot;Clown in the Dumps&quot; in the twenty-sixth season, in which the character dies.

==Cultural references==
The episode is a homage to the film &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), about a son with a strict religious upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer. Krusty is partially based on Jewish comedian Jerry Lewis, who starred in the 1959 version of the film. A nod to the film is featured in dialogue when Rabbi Krustofsky says, &quot;Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive!&quot; In the Simpsons house, Krusty plays &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;. In Krusty&#x27;s studio, there are pictures of him with Alfred Hitchcock and The Beatles. Lisa tells Homer there are many Jewish entertainers, including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner and Mel Brooks. In Krusty&#x27;s flashback, he and his father walk down the street in a parody of a scene from &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. The scene of a young Krusty practicing comedy in the bathroom is a reference to Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;. Lisa and Bart try to trick Hyman into meeting Krusty, telling him that &quot;the Nobel-Prize winning Jewish novelist Saul Bellow&quot; wants to have lunch with him at Izzy&#x27;s Deli. They tell Krusty that he&#x27;s to be presented with the Legion of Honor and walks in humming &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, asking to be directed to François Mitterrand&#x27;s table. At the end of the episode, Krusty and his father sing &quot;O Mein Papa&quot;, a 1952 song originally by Eddie Fisher. Bart quotes a passage from Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s 1965 autobiography &quot;Yes, I Can&quot;.

==Reception==

In its original broadcast, &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; finished 34th in ratings for the week of October 21–27, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 12.7. It was the highest rated program on Fox that week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen ratings/Oct 21-27&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mason won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Hyman Krustofsky. He was one of six voice actors from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to win the award in its inaugural year.

He is one of three &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest stars to win the award; Marcia Wallace won in 1992 for voicing Edna Krabappel, and Kelsey Grammer won for voicing Sideshow Bob in 2006. In 1998, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed it in its list of top twelve &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes. The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode, &quot;a magnificent show, with Jackie Mason wonderfully over the top as Krusty&#x27;s long-lost pa, and Lois Pennycandy giving Krusty a good talking to about Bart.&quot;

Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; listed &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; as one of the ten episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that shows the &quot;comic and emotional scope of the show&quot;. They wrote, &quot;Most Krusty the Klown episodes go heavy on celebrity cameos, while playing up the character&#x27;s misanthropic greed. This one gave him a heart, as Bart and Lisa try to reunite him with his estranged rabbi father (voice of Jackie Mason), who has never forgiven his son for going into show biz.&quot; DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode &quot;lacks a surfeit of guffaws, but it manages to be sweet and heartfelt without becoming sappy. It&#x27;s more of a charming show than a laughfest, but it does the job.&quot;

In a retrospective review in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin writes &quot;Like most Borsht-Belt shtick-slingers, Krusty is prickly and hard on the outside but soft, tender and sweet on the inside. Shtick without sentimentality is like lox without bagels and &#x27;Like Father, Like Son&#x27; taps into a side of Krusty we seldom see: a lost little boy who never got over his father’s rejection and pines for what he sees as the domestic bliss of the Simpsons. As Lisa says with just the right note of sad, weary understanding, &#x27;A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.&#x27;”

In his 2018 memoir &quot;Springfield Confidential&quot;, &quot;Simpsons&quot; season 3 showrunner Mike Reiss named the episode as one of four that broke new ground, alongside &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot;, &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; and the original &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot;. Reiss noted how the episode established several new precedents for the show: it centered on a secondary character, it focused on a non-Christian religion and expert consultants were involved in the writing of the religious debate between the Rabbi and Bart.

<doc id="952705" wikidata="Q6540946" url="?curid=952705" title="Liberalism in North Macedonia">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[North Macedonia]]. North Macedonia was not an independent country before 1991, so the parties from Serbia and Yugoslavia were active before that year. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary for parties to label themselves as a liberal party.

==History==
In the years immediately following independence, liberalism became a major force but, since 2000, the major political grouping has split into the liberal democrats and mainline factions. Nowadays, the liberals are divided into the Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Liberalna Demokraticka Partija&quot;, member LI), part of the left of center government coalition, and the Liberal Party of Macedonia (&quot;Liberalna Partija na Makedonija&quot;, member ELDR), part of the right of center opposition coalition.

===From Union of Reformist Forces in Macedonia to Liberal Party of Macedonia===
*1990: The Macedonian followers of Ante Marković established the Union of Reformist Forces in Macedonia (&quot;Sojuz na Reformiskite Sili na Makedonija&quot;), led by Stojan Andov.
*1991: The party was renamed Reformist Forces of Macedonia-Liberal Party (&quot;Sojuz na Reformiskite Sili na Makedonija-Liberalna Partija&quot;) after the Young Democratic-Progressive Party joined the party.
*1994: The party was renamed Liberal Party of Macedonia (&quot;Liberalna Partija na Makedonija&quot;).
*1997: The party merged with the Democratic Party into the Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Liberalno-Demokratska Partija&quot;).
*2000: The LDP split and the Liberal Party of Macedonia (&quot;Liberalna Partija na Makedonija&quot;) was reconstituted with Andov as leader.

===From Democratic Party of Macedonia to Liberal Democratic Party===
*1993: Petar Gošev left the SDSM and founded the centrist Democratic Party (&quot;Demokratska Partija&quot;)
*1997: The party merged with the Liberal Party of Macedonia into the Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Liberalno-Demokratska Partija&quot;)
*2000: The LDP split and the Liberal Party of Macedonia was reconstituted. Most of the party continued as the Liberal Democratic Party, with Risto Penov as leader

<doc id="952709" wikidata="Q739756" url="?curid=952709" title="Ryan Smyth">
<text>Ryan Alexander Borden Smyth (born February 21, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played most of his career for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was especially known for playing in the style of a power forward. He has been one of the owners of the BCHL Spruce Grove Saints since 2017.

During his junior career, Ryan Smyth spent three years with the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL), scoring 105 points during the 1993–94 season. Smyth was then drafted 6th overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the Edmonton Oilers. That year he played only three games for the Oilers, as he stayed for the majority of the year in Moose Jaw. He spent 12 seasons with Edmonton before being traded to the New York Islanders in 2007 due to failed contract negotiations. Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the subsequent off-season, he signed a five-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche. After two seasons with the team, he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in July 2009. On June 26, 2011, he was re-acquired by the Edmonton Oilers for Colin Fraser and a seventh-round pick in 2012. He announced his retirement on April 11, 2014, after 19 seasons in the NHL. 

Smyth has represented Canada in international competition on numerous occasions. He has won gold medals at the 1995 World Junior Championship, 2002 Winter Olympics, 2003 and 2004 World Championships, and 2004 World Cup. Having served as captain of Canada&#x27;s World Championship team for a team record six years (2001–05 and 2010), he has earned the nickname &quot;Captain Canada.&quot; Smyth is also Canada&#x27;s all-time leader in games played at the tournament. He played a record 90 games for Hockey Canada while becoming the only player in hockey history to win gold in all of Olympics, World Cup, World Championships, World Juniors, and Spengler Cup. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Playing career==
===Moose Jaw Warriors (1992–1995)===
Smyth played in the junior ranks with the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Beginning in 1991–92, he debuted in two games with the team, recording no points. The following season, he notched 19 goals and 33 points over 64 games as a rookie. In 1993–94, he improved to 50 goals and 105 points over 72 games, becoming a top NHL prospect. During the subsequent off-season, he was selected sixth overall by the Edmonton Oilers in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Some Oilers&#x27; scouts wanted to draft Ethan Moreau (future Oilers captain), in part because he was a linemate of the Oilers&#x27; fourth overall selection, Jason Bonsignore (who only ended up playing 79 NHL games, 21 of those with the Oilers). Sather, however, went with the opinion of scout Lorne Davis and selected Smyth instead.

Following his selection, Smyth returned to the WHL for one more season with Moose Jaw, recording 41 goals and 86 points over 50 games in 1994–95. He helped the Warriors qualify for the playoffs for the first time in his tenure with the team and added 15 points over 10 post-season games. Smyth had his number 28 retired by the Moose Jaw Warriors in 2015.
===Edmonton Oilers (1994–2007)===
During his final junior season, Smyth was briefly called up to the NHL by the Oilers. He made his debut on January 22, 1995, in an away game against the Los Angeles Kings. Playing in three games total, he did not record any points. The following season, he tallied his first goal, on November 24, 1995, against Trevor Kidd of the Calgary Flames while on the power play. He went on to record two goals and 11 points over 48 games as a rookie, while also spending time in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Oilers&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Cape Breton Oilers. He recorded 11 points over 9 AHL games in 1995–96.

Smyth spent the entire 1996–97 season with the Oilers and improved to 39 goals (a career-high) and 61 points over 82 games. At the beginning of the season, on October 8, 1996, he recorded his first of five career hat tricks. With 20 power-play goals, he tied Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s team record, set in 1983–84. In the 1997 playoffs, he added 10 points in 12 games. Despite a strong second NHL season, he struggled in the next two campaigns with 33- and 31-point efforts. In 1999–2000, he returned to form with a 28-goal, 54-point year. The following season, he recorded a career-high 39 assists and 70 points, ranking second in team scoring to team captain and first-line centre Doug Weight.

As Weight was traded in the off-season to the St. Louis Blues, Smyth took on a larger role as offensive leader on the team. For the remainder of his tenure with the Oilers, he remained in the 50–60 point range. During the 2001–02 season, he ranked third in team scoring with 15 goals and 50 points to Mike Comrie and Anson Carter&#x27;s 60 points, despite playing in 21 games less than them due to injury. The following season, he appeared in 66 games and increased his offensive totals to 27 goals and 61 points. It marked the first time in his career that he led the Oilers in scoring, edging Todd Marchant by one point. During the off-season, Smyth filed for salary arbitration after initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Oilers. On August 14, 2003, both sides avoided arbitration by signing a two-year contract.

Playing a full 82 games in 2003–04, Smyth tallied 59 points (23 goals and 36 assists) to lead the Oilers in scoring for the second straight year. During that season, Smyth spent several games as the Oilers&#x27; captain while active captain Jason Smith was out with an ankle injury. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Smyth spent the season inactive. As NHL play resumed the next year, he approached career-high totals with 36 goals and 66 points. With several young players emerging on the team&#x27;s roster, Smyth ranked fourth in team scoring, behind Aleš Hemský, Shawn Horcoff and Jarret Stoll. His 19 power-play goals came within one of the team records he previously set in his second year with the Oilers. Although Edmonton entered the 2006 playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference, Smyth helped the team on a run to the Stanley Cup Finals with 16 points in 24 post-season games. During the second round against the San Jose Sharks, he was hit in the mouth with a puck as a result of a clearing attempt from defensive teammate Chris Pronger. After losing three teeth and needing stitches, Smyth returned in the third period and went on to set up Shawn Horcoff&#x27;s game-winning goal in triple-overtime. The win reduced San Jose&#x27;s series lead to 2–1, helping the Oilers eventually advance to the Conference Finals in six games. After eliminating the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the third round, the Oilers were ultimately defeated in seven games by the Carolina Hurricanes in the Finals. Had the Oilers won the Stanley Cup, Smyth would have joined the Triple Gold Club along with Chris Pronger and Jaroslav Špaček.

Early the following season, during a game against the San Jose Sharks on October 12, 2006, Smyth broke an Oilers record for the fastest three goals scored in one contest. With the Sharks leading 4–2 in the third period, he recorded a hat trick with two goals on the power play and one more on a 5-on-5 in two minutes and one second, breaking the previous team record set by Wayne Gretzky on February 18, 1981, by 17 seconds. It was Smyth&#x27;s fifth career hat trick as Edmonton went on to win the game 6–4. In the final year of his contract, Smyth was enjoying one of the most productive seasons of his career. As a result, he was chosen for his first NHL All-Star Game in 2007. With the Oilers unable to extend his contract before the NHL trade deadline, Smyth was dealt away to the New York Islanders in exchange for prospects Robert Nilsson and Ryan O&#x27;Marra, as well as a first-round selection in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. It was reported that Smyth was asking for a long-term deal worth at least $5 million a season to remain in Edmonton. The move was made to ensure the team did not lose Smyth for nothing, as he became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season. At the time of the trade, he was scoring at a point-per-game pace with 31 goals and 22 assists over 53 games.

Despite playing the remainder of the season with the Islanders, he finished tied for the Oilers lead in point-scoring that year; Petr Sýkora had 53 points in a full 82 games. Before boarding a flight for New York with his family, Smyth tearfully addressed the media at Edmonton International Airport, thanking the Oilers for his time with the organization and expressing regret for having to be traded. He stated he was going to win the Stanley Cup with the Islanders and bring it to Edmonton. Leaving the Oilers after 12 seasons, he ranked seventh on the team&#x27;s all-time list for points scored with 549 over 770 games.

===New York Islanders (2007)===
Smyth debuted with the Islanders on March 1, 2007, during a game against the St. Louis Blues. He notched his first point as an Islander with an assist on Mike Sillinger&#x27;s first-period power play goal; New York lost the game 3–2 in overtime. Two days later, he recorded his first goal as an Islander in a 6–2 win against the Washington Capitals. Playing in 18 games with the Islanders to close out the 2006–07 season, Smyth posted 15 points (5 goals and 10 assists). Combined with his stats from Edmonton, he finished with 36 goals and 68 points, the second-highest totals of his career. Smyth&#x27;s efforts helped the Islanders beat out the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens for the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2007 playoffs. Playing the first-seeded Buffalo Sabres in the opening round, the Islanders were defeated in five games. Smyth recorded one goal and three assists during the series.

===Colorado Avalanche (2007–2009)===

Becoming an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2007, Smyth signed a five-year, $31.2 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche. After debuting with the Avalanche on October 3, 2007, in a 4–3 win against the Dallas Stars, he scored his first goal with his new team four days later. Beating goaltender Evgeni Nabokov short-handed during the third period, he helped Colorado to a 6–2 win. Playing on the first line, Smyth found early chemistry with centre and team captain Joe Sakic. The duo was interrupted, however, as both players were sidelined with injuries for large portions of the season – Smyth&#x27;s included neck, ankle and head ailments. Limited to 55 games, he recorded 14 goals and 37 points, the lowest totals of his career since the 1998–99 season. During the 2008 playoffs, Smyth helped Colorado advance past the Minnesota Wild in the first round. They were, however, swept the following round by the Detroit Red Wings, who went on to win the Stanley Cup that year. Smyth missed the last two games of the playoffs with a foot injury, finishing with two goals and five points over eight games.

Smyth bounced back from an injury-filled first year with the Avalanche by remaining healthy for the majority of the 2008–09 season. During the campaign, Ryan Smyth and right winger Milan Hejduk scored their respective 300th career goals on January 18, 2009, against the Calgary Flames in a 6–2 victory at the Pepsi Center. He went on to record 26 goals and 33 assists for 59 points over 77 games, before fracturing his right hand on April 1, 2009, in a 3–0 home loss against the Phoenix Coyotes, ending his season five games early. He tied for the team lead in point-scoring with Hejduk, who played in five more games than Smyth. Dealing with long-term injuries to both Paul Stastny and captain Joe Sakic, the Avalanche struggled as a team and finished last in the Western Conference.

===Los Angeles Kings (2009–2011)===
With the Avalanche in the midst of a rebuilding process, Smyth was traded to the Los Angeles Kings on July 3, 2009, in exchange for Kyle Quincey, Tom Preissing and a fifth-round selection in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. During his Kings debut on October 3, 2009, he assisted on the team&#x27;s first goal of the season by Anže Kopitar. The Kings, however, lost the game 6–3 to the Phoenix Coyotes. His first goal with the Kings came five days later, scoring against Minnesota Wild goaltender Josh Harding in a 6–3 win. Playing regularly on a line with Jarret Stoll and Dustin Brown, he recorded 22 goals and 53 points over 67 games, ranking fourth in team scoring. Joining a team on a markedly different trajectory than Colorado, the Kings were an improving club. Smyth&#x27;s efforts helped them qualify for the playoffs for the first time in eight years. Playing the third-seeded Vancouver Canucks in the first round, they were defeated in six games.

A month into the 2010–11 season, Smyth played his 1,000th career NHL game on November 6, 2010. His teammates acknowledged the accomplishment by wearing mullet wigs during their morning skate, alluding to Smyth&#x27;s distinctive hairstyle. The Kings won the game 4–1 over the Nashville Predators, with Smyth scoring a goal in the second period. Playing in a full 82 games, Smyth finished the season with 23 goals and 47 points. The Kings qualified for the playoffs with the seventh seed and were eliminated in the first round by the San Jose Sharks.

During the off-season, it was reported that Smyth had informed Kings management he would prefer to play the last year of his contract with the Oilers.

===Return to the Oilers (2011–2014)===
On June 24, 2011, the day of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, it was reported that the Edmonton Oilers and the Los Angeles Kings had come to an agreement that Smyth would go to Edmonton in return for Gilbert Brulé and a fourth-round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Upon salary cap and injury concerns, the trade never went through due to the Kings&#x27; plan to buy out Brulé&#x27;s contract; however, the NHL prohibits teams from buying out injured players. Smyth wanted to leave the Kings and return to the Oilers, as he wanted to end his career where he started it. On June 26, 2011, the Kings officially traded Smyth back to Edmonton for Colin Fraser and a seventh-round draft pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.

In 2011–12, his first season back with the Oilers, Smyth was the only Oiler to play all 82 games and was fifth in scoring with 46 points. On February 27, 2012, he recorded his 800th career point, an assist, against the Winnipeg Jets.

On January 26, 2014, Smyth tied Wayne Gretzky for number two on the Oilers all-time power-play goal-scoring list in a 5–1 win over the Nashville Predators. On March 6, he overtook Gretzky and tied Glenn Anderson for the most power-play goals in franchise history with 126.

With the Oilers out of playoff position towards the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, on April 11, Smyth announced his retirement after 19 seasons from the National Hockey League aged . He served as the team captain in his final game and also received the game&#x27;s first star honours. Rexall Place had its ring that traditionally read &quot;WELCOME TO OIL COUNTRY&quot; changed to read &quot;THANK YOU SMYTTY&quot;.

==International play==





Smyth debuted with Hockey Canada with the country&#x27;s under-20 team at the 1995 World Junior Championships in Red Deer, Alberta. He recorded two goals and seven points as Canada went undefeated in seven games to win the gold medal. Four years later, Smyth was chosen to the Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s team for the 1999 IIHF World Championship in Norway. As a result of the Oilers&#x27; short playoff seasons (the team made the second round twice and the Finals once in his 12-year tenure), Smyth was a mainstay on Canada&#x27;s World Championship roster (the international tournament conflicted with the NHL&#x27;s playoff schedule). The 1999 tournament marked the first of seven consecutive appearances for Smyth. He recorded two assists over nine games as Canada finished in fourth place, losing the bronze medal game to Sweden.

The following year in Russia, Smyth improved to an international career-high three goals and nine points over nine games. Canada finished fourth for the second consecutive year as they lost the bronze medal game to Finland. In preparation for the 2001 IIHF World Championship in Germany, Smyth was named team captain for Canada; it marked the first of five years he served in that role, earning him the nickname &quot;Captain Canada.&quot; Smyth recorded two goals and five points over seven games, but Canada faced an early exit as they were eliminated by the United States in the quarter-final.

In December 2001, Smyth was selected to Canada&#x27;s team for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. It marked the first time he was selected to a national team when all NHL players were available (the league temporarily suspended play during the 2001–02 season to allow their players to participate). Smyth contributed one assist in six games, helping Canada win their first Olympic gold medal in ice hockey since 1952. It was also Smyth&#x27;s first gold medal at the men&#x27;s level. Later that year, he made his fourth consecutive appearance at the World Championship in Sweden. Canada was once again eliminated in the quarter-final, this time to Slovakia. Smyth had four goals and no assists over seven games.

After four years without a medal in World Championship competition, Smyth captained Canada to gold at the 2003 IIHF World Championship in Finland. He recorded two goals and four points over nine games, en route to a 3–2 win over Sweden in the final. Canada defended their gold medal in the following year in the Czech Republic. In a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s final, Canada beat Sweden 5–3. In nine tournament games, Smyth contributed two goals and four points.

In September 2004, the NHL and NHL Players Association held the first World Cup of Hockey in eight years. Held outside of the NHL schedule (although league play was suspended for the 2004–05 season due to a lockout), all players were eligible to participate. Smyth was named to the national team and contributed three goals and an assist over six games. Canada won the World Cup title with a win over Finland in the final. The following year, all NHL players were again available for international competition at the 2005 IIHF World Championship in Austria, due to the ongoing lockout. It marked the first time that this was the case in tournament history. Smyth retained his captaincy and helped Canada to the gold medal game for the third straight year. Facing the Czech Republic, they were shut out 3–0, earning the silver medal.

In December 2005, he was named to Canada&#x27;s Olympic team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Canada failed to defend their gold medal from 2002, however, and were eliminated in the quarterfinal by Russia. Smyth was held to one assist in six games. He was also selected for the 2010 Winter Olympics summer roster for Team Canada in August 2009, but did not make the final roster cut.

The 2010 IIHF World Championship tournament in Germany would mark Smyth&#x27;s last appearance for Canada, where he was named team captain for the sixth time, a Canadian record at the tournament. Early on in the tournament, he suffered an ankle injury during practice and was kept from the remainder of the competition. Canada lost the quarter-final to Russia that year. In 2012, he won the Spengler Cup playing for Canada, again serving as the team&#x27;s captain.

==Playing style==

Smyth played in the style of a power forward, depending largely on his size and strength to contribute offensively. By positioning himself in front of the net, he earned most of his goals by tipping pucks in past the goaltender or scoring on rebounds. He did not possess particularly good shooting, stickhandling, or skating skills. He had been known to use a two-piece stick (composite shaft with wooden blade) with a flat blade, both of which were trends that largely went out of date during or before Smyth&#x27;s career.

When the Oilers drafted him out of junior, Darryl Davis (son of scout Lorne Davis) said that General Manager Glen Sather was looking for someone with &quot;lots of guts.&quot; Smyth was also known as a leader, having served as captain for Canada&#x27;s World Championship teams on six occasions. He also served as an alternate captain on nearly all of the teams he played with in the NHL, save for his brief stint with the Islanders.

==Personal life==
Smyth is married with four children. 
His wife owns a clothing store called Four. 

His older brother, Kevin played 58 games in the NHL for the Hartford Whalers.

<text>The Bijlands Kanaal (Bijland Canal) is a canal in the Dutch province of Gelderland, near the Dutch-German border. It is currently by far the most important river-stretch of the Rhine when that major river enters the Netherlands.

It was dug between 1773 and 1776 to cut off a large bend in river Waal to improve water regulation. This bend, and comparable waters, are currently only minor streams. They are known as the minor Oude Waal and De Bijland, and the larger Oude Rijn. The, more or less, defunct flows now only serve one purpose: to function as a buffer zone between the free flowing Waal and Nederrijn on one side and the abandoned stream-beds on the other side. The defuncts streams are shallow waters for most of the time and serve as an important spawning ground for all kinds of fish (since they remained connected to the main river through small creeks).

However, in times of extreme high water-levels the &#x27;dead&#x27; waters spring to life again, as the result of artificial overflow-devices. From time to time, the Oude Waal and De Bijland can temporarily taste the freedom of a free-flowing river. The area surrounding the &#x27;dead&#x27; rivers is known for its historical significance and is a relic of a type of historical dyke landscape that is becoming more and more rare in the Netherlands.
The Bijlands Kanaal is part of the extensive reconstruction works that Gelderland, then a semi-independent state within the federation of the Dutch Republic, undertook to better regulate water flow around the Rhine-Waal fork. It is named after Castle De Bijland, which had been destroyed by the river Waal &quot;circa&quot; 1750. In addition to the Bijlands Kanaal, the Pannerdens Kanaal is part also part of the same river regulation system. Both canals cut off shallow and slow-moving bends in the river Rhine, now known as the Oude Waal and De Bijland. Although both waters are called &quot;Kanaal&quot; (English: canal) they are now an indistinguishable part of the river and both lost all characteristics of an artificial structure. The area surrounding both the main rivers Waal and Rhine, and the mostly defunct abandoned streams, are all part of the extensive nature restoration project known as the Gelderse Poort.

Nowadays, the canal is of enormous importance to Rhine navigation, being part of the main Rhine waterway and the first section of the Waal-Rhine fork.

<text>Herman Terrance Aubrey &quot;Boycie&quot; Boyce (born 31 January 1948) is a fictional character in the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, played by John Challis. His story is continued in the spin-off series &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; in which Boycie and his family flee to the countryside to escape from the Driscoll Brothers. A younger Boycie also appears in the prequel series &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. Along with Denzil, he is one of only two characters to appear in all three.

==Profile==
Boycie is a local second-hand car dealer from Lewisham; for a long time, he was the richest and most successful regular at the Nag&#x27;s Head pub. His drink of choice is a large cognac. 

Boycie, although materially successful and ostentatious in his spending, remains competitive with Del and other friends, enjoying their company, although he does enjoy revelling in his superiority. Despite this, it appears that he dearly loves his friends throughout the series. He generally wears clothes and carries accessories synonymous with 1980s yuppie success, such as trench coats and very early mobile telephones. In the episode &quot;Sickness and Wealth&quot;, in which the series regulars took part in a séance, the medium (Uncle Albert&#x27;s girlfriend, Elsie Partridge) asked for &quot;an Audrey. Audrey. No... Aubrey?&quot; When Boycie replied that his middle name was Aubrey, Trigger said &quot;You never told us your name is Aubrey.&quot; Boycie replied &quot;Nor would you if your name was Aubrey.&quot; The &quot;Peckham Archives&quot; book suggests that Boycie&#x27;s father was a Luftwaffe Officer.

Boycie and Del share a loose friendship, but prefer to play a long-standing game of one-upmanship. They play each other at poker, in which they both cheat and the stakes are high. Boycie is at pains to maintain the upper hand over Del in that he is a mason, a successful businessman and wealthier than the Trotters. One of his trademarks is his deep, mocking laugh, usually following a sarcastic, biting remark at the expense of other characters, as well as his distinctive South London nasal twang. Boycie made his first appearance in second episode of the first series; he made sporadic appearances from series 2–5 and appeared more frequently in series 6 and 7.

It is, however, usually Del, a character more street smart and popular with the Nag&#x27;s Head social group, who gains the upper hand, often trading on the fact that he has a long-standing, flirtatious friendship with Boycie&#x27;s wife, Marlene. Del has alluded to past sexual encounters with Marlene, and to her reputation among the Nag&#x27;s Head regulars as &quot;The Peckham Bicycle&quot;. He has also claimed to have inside knowledge, through Marlene, of Boycie&#x27;s marital secrets, and has alleged that Boycie has at times suffered from impotence; these rumours were not fully quashed even after the eventual birth – following many attempts – of Boycie and Marlene&#x27;s son, Tyler.

Boycie enjoys overt displays of wealth, formerly living in King&#x27;s Avenue, the most expensive street in south east London. He also owns a holiday cottage in Cornwall.

In &quot;The Green Green Grass,&quot; Boycie is portrayed with the same personality as in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; but he seems to be more respected by women. In one episode, &quot;Sex and the Country&quot;, he is seduced by Tyler&#x27;s English teacher, who admits she likes more mature men, and in another episode, &quot;Life Swap&quot;, Boycie&#x27;s swapped wife tries to seduce him.

In two episodes, there are allusions to Boycie having had at least two extramarital affairs. In &quot;Go West Young Man&quot;, he reveals he has a &quot;bit on the side&quot;, for whom he buys an E-type Jaguar, but it is later crashed into while Del is driving it. In &quot;Dates&quot;, Del blackmails Boycie into doing a favour for him by threatening to inform Marlene of an encounter Boycie had with a woman in Sheffield.

It is revealed in the episode &quot;From Prussia With Love&quot; that Boycie spent some time in prison in his youth. His criminal record includes convictions for perjury, embezzlement, conspiring to pervert the course of justice, the fraudulent conversion of traveller&#x27;s cheques and attempting to bribe the Mayor of Lambeth.

In &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;, Boycie is portrayed as a young man and a member of Del&#x27;s gang at school. He is still the tight person seen in the original stories, although he is much more amiable and humorous as a young man. Later in the series, after leaving school, he gets a job as a car cleaner for Alberto Balsam, a Spanish second-hand car dealer. Though Boycie is clean shaven throughout the prequel, Sullivan had reportedly intended Boycie to grow his trademark moustache in later episodes.

==First name==
Throughout &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;, Boycie is given many first names, including Aubrey, which he reveals is his middle name, as can be heard during the séance scene in the episode &quot;Sickness and Wealth&quot;. At his remarriage, after discovering his forty-year marriage to Marlene was unofficial because the registrar was unlicenced, the vicar names him as &quot;Herman Aubrey Boyce&quot;. However, in &quot;Strangers on the Shore&quot;, his first name is clearly seen as Terrance on the contract book towards the end of the episode. The &quot;Peckham Archives&quot; book has his full name as &quot;Herman Terrance Aubrey Boyce&quot;.

<doc id="952721" wikidata="Q2905391" url="?curid=952721" title="Carling Black Label">
<text>Carling Black Label is a lager distributed by Carling Brewing Company.

== History ==
Although its original focus was on ale, Carling has brewed lager-style beers since the 1870s. In 1927, as part of a corporate re-branding under new president J. Innes Carling, the company renamed its Black &amp; White Lager to Black Label. 

Three years later, Carling was purchased by Toronto business tycoon E. P. Taylor, who merged it into his Canadian Breweries Limited (CBL), which grew to be the world&#x27;s largest brewing company. Under Taylor, Black Label was promoted as CBL&#x27;s flagship brand and went on to become the first beer to be brewed on a mass international scale, becoming particularly popular in Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

=== Canada ===
In response to a shift in popular taste away from ale, Carling added a three-storey lager plant to their main London, Ontario, brewery in 1877. Carling&#x27;s Lager (later renamed Carling&#x27;s Bavarian Stock Lager, and then Carling&#x27;s Imperial Club Lager) was the company&#x27;s first lager. Carling&#x27;s Black &amp; White Lager was introduced in the 1920s and later renamed Black Label Lager, in contrast to their Red Cap Ale.

Around 1990, Black Label had an advertising campaign in Canada which used the phrase &quot;The Legend is Black&quot;.

=== United States ===

After the repeal of prohibition in 1933, the Peerless Motor Car Company, looking for a way to diversify in the car market of the Great Depression, purchased the American rights to Carling&#x27;s formulas, identifying labels and trademarks. Technicians and brewmasters were sent from Canada to convert a Peerless plant in Cleveland, Ohio, into the Brewing Corporation of America. They first tried just brewing Carling&#x27;s Red Cap Ale, but sales were too slow to maintain the brewery, and didn&#x27;t climb until the introduction of Black Label lager. The philosophy behind Black Label was to have a high quality lager that was available nationwide, but with a locally brewed budget price. The strategy worked, and the next several decades led to rapid growth and expansion for the brewery and the Carling Black Label brand. Carling Black Label was available to GIs in Vietnam, but still in steel cans, which were sometimes rusted when the troops got it there, and served warm.

When Carling stopped producing Black Label to focus on a more profitable lager, they found their sales plummeting. Carling re-introduced Black Label with a beautiful blonde named Mabel, portrayed by Jeanne Goodspeed, with the slogan &quot;Hey Mabel, Black Label!&quot;. The twenty-year marketing campaign cemented the name in the popular culture of America.

In 1979, after several years of intense pressure from Miller and Anheuser-Busch, Carling was bought out by the Heileman Brewing Co. of La Crosse, Wisconsin. Carling and the Black Label brand are currently owned by the Molson Coors Brewing Company. Though no longer widely distributed in the U.S., Black Label is still available in select markets (notably, metro Detroit), and remains the official beer of Beer Frisbee.

=== United Kingdom ===

Black Label was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1952. Originally only available in bottles, in 1965 the Hill Top in Sheffield became the first pub to pour Carling Black Label on draught.


In the 1970s and 80s, Carling Black Label sales were driven to great heights, due partly to increased advertising support, in particular the classic &quot;I bet he drinks&quot; series of advertisements, and partly with the launch of Carling Black Label in cans. Cans were important to Carling&#x27;s success as they helped open up the &quot;take home&quot; market. 

The &quot;I bet he drinks&quot; series of ads showed someone doing something cool, clever or difficult, and having a bystander say &quot;I bet he drinks Carling Black Label&quot;. With the help of this advertising campaign, it became Britain&#x27;s best-selling brand of beer in 1971. In the 1980s, many of the adverts featured comedians Mark Arden and Stephen Frost, also known as The Oblivion Boys, delivering the classic punchline. One of the advertisements in the series, &quot;Dambusters&quot; from 1989, was a parody of the 1955 film of the same name, and was ranked at number 12 on ITV&#x27;s list of the &quot;Best Ever Ads&quot; in 2005, and at number 17 on Channel 4&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest TV Ads&quot; in 2000. Campaign Live also ranked it at number 5 in their list of the &quot;Top 10 Funniest TV Ads of All Time&quot; in 2008.

Carling was Britain&#x27;s best selling draught beer between 1985 and 2024. Black Label has been dropped from the brand name and logo in Britain since 1997.

=== South Africa ===

In South Africa, Black Label began to take on a different tone with the anti-apartheid movement. This was partly due to the fact that, at 5.5%, it had more alcohol than the other brands of beer that generally had 5.0%, as noted in the popular advertising catch phrase &quot;only hard working students deserve an extra 0.5 percent&quot;.

Furthermore, the connotation of black to the racial issue became a point of pride to the native Africans. It used to be sold with the motto, &quot;America&#x27;s Lusty, Lively Beer&quot;, perhaps in reference to Canada, though it is seldom seen in the United States. The motto came from an older advertising campaign in the United States. Another famous Afrikaans slogan for Black Label in South Africa is &quot;Black Label sê die bybel&quot;, which means &quot;The Bible says (one should drink) Black Label&quot;.

The beer was parodied by South African T-shirt company Laughitoff. The slogan was changed to &quot;Black Labour, White Guilt&quot;, which led to an unsuccessful trademark infringement lawsuit from SABMiller.

The brand has the local nickname &quot;Zamalek&quot;, after the Egyptian soccer team Zamalek SC beat Kaizer Chiefs in the 1990s.

<doc id="952723" wikidata="Q1045147" url="?curid=952723" title="Assist (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player&#x27;s leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist.

If a pitcher records a strikeout where the third strike is caught by the catcher, the pitcher is not credited with an assist. However, if the batter becomes a baserunner on a dropped third strike and the pitcher is involved in recording a putout by fielding the ball and either tagging the runner out or throwing to first base for the out, the pitcher is credited with an assist just as any other fielder would be.

Assists are an important statistic for outfielders, as a play often occurs when a baserunner on the opposing team attempts to advance on the basepaths when the ball is hit to the outfield (even on a caught fly ball that results in an out; see tag up). It is the outfielder&#x27;s job to field the ball and make an accurate throw to another fielder who is covering the base before the runner reaches it. The fielder then attempts to tag the runner out. This is especially important if the runner was trying to reach home plate, as the assist and tag prevent the baserunner from scoring a run. Assists are much rarer for outfielders than infielders (with the exception of first basemen) because the play is harder to make, and also because outfielder assist situations occur less often than the traditional ground-ball assist for a shortstop, second baseman, or third baseman. However, as a result, outfield assists are worth far more than infield assists, and tell more about an outfielder&#x27;s throwing arm than infielder assists do.

In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills. Some sabermetricians are also using &quot;baserunner holds&quot; as a statistic to measure outfield arms. A baserunner hold occurs when the baserunner does not attempt to advance an extra base on an outfielder out of concern of being thrown out by a strong, accurate throw. This can be combined with baserunner kills for better accuracy, as runners often do not try for an extra base when an outfielder with an excellent arm is playing.

<doc id="952728" wikidata="Q487829" url="?curid=952728" title="Chagatai Khanate">
<text>The Chagatai Khanate, also known as the Chagatai Ulus, was a Mongol and later Turkicized khanate that comprised the lands ruled by Chagatai Khan, second son of Genghis Khan, and his descendants and successors. At its height in the late 13th century the khanate extended from the Amu Darya south of the Aral Sea to the Altai Mountains in the border of modern-day Mongolia and China, roughly corresponding to the area once ruled by the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty).

Initially, the rulers of the Chagatai Khanate recognized the supremacy of the Great Khan, but by the reign of Kublai Khan, Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq no longer obeyed the emperor&#x27;s orders. From 1363, the Chagatais progressively lost Transoxiana to the Timurids. The reduced realm came to be known as Moghulistan, which lasted until the late 15th century, when it broke off into the Yarkent Khanate and Turpan Khanate. In 1680, the remaining Chagatai domains lost their independence to the Dzungar Khanate. Finally, the Kumul Khanate, an autonomous division of China established during the Qing dynasty in 1696 and governed by descendants of Chagatai Khan, was abolished during the Republic of China in 1930, ending the dynasty.

==Name==
The Chagatai Khanate was also known as the Dumdadu Mongγol Ulus (the Middle Mongolian Empire). For example, Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli, who visited Yuan dynasty in the 1340s, referred to Almaliq (the capital of the Chagatai Khanate) as &quot;Almalek of the Middle Empire (Imperium Medium)&quot;. In addition, the Catalan Atlas of 1375 refers to the area corresponding to Chagatai Khanate as &quot;Imperium Medorum&quot;, a possible alternate name of &quot;Imperium Medium&quot;. In addition to the Latin sources mentioned above, Ibn Battuta records in Arabic that &quot;His country [is in] the middle between the four of the powerful kings on the earth, i.e., King of China, King of India, King of Iraq and King Özbeg&quot;. This description suggests that the Chagatai Khanate was called the &quot;Middle Empire&quot; because it was located exactly in the middle of Eurasia.

Matsui Dai introduced the expression &quot;[missing] -dadu mongγo[l] u(l)us&quot; in a Uighur script document excavated from Turfan, and based on the example of &quot;Middle Empire (Imperium Medium),&quot; argued that this should be read as &quot;Dumdadu Mongγol Ulus&quot;. Matsui proposed that &quot;it seems probable that Dua or his descendants took the brand-new official state name Dumdadu Mongol Ulus in order to affirm that their polity was renewed, as did the emperor Qubilai, who in 1271 adopted the official state name Dai Ön Yeke Mongol Ulus.

==History==
===Vassal of the Great Khan (1227–1266)===
When Genghis Khan died in 1227, his son Chagatai Khan inherited the regions roughly corresponding to the defunct Qara Khitai Empire: Issyk-Kul, Ili River, Chu River, Talas River, Transoxania, and the Tarim Basin. Chagatai was not fully independent in his khanate however and still received orders from Karakorum. When he dismissed the governor of Transoxania, Mahmud Yalavach, Ögedei Khan reinstated Mahmud, whose dynasty continued to administer the region even after the death of Chagatai. In 1238 there was a Muslim uprising in Bukhara, but Mahmud&#x27;s son Mas&#x27;ud crushed it the next year before Mongol troops were able to arrive, thereby saving the populace from Mongol vengeance.
Chagatai Khan died in 1242 and was succeeded by his grandson Qara Hülegü. He was too young to rule independently so the widowed khatun Ebuskun ruled as regent in his place. In 1246, Güyük Khan replaced him with one of his uncles, Yesü Möngke.

Yesü Möngke came to power because he was a personal friend of Güyük Khan. He was a drunkard who left the affairs of the state to his wife and minister Beha ad-Din Marghinani. In 1252 he was deposed by Möngke Khan, who installed Qara Hülegü again.

Qara Hülegü died on his way home and was succeeded by his son Mubarak Shah.

Mubarak Shah was too young to rule and state affairs were managed by his mother Orghana. In 1260, Ariq Böke replaced Mubarak Shah with Alghu, a grandson of Chagatai Khan. Alghu rebelled against Ariq Böke upon securing power and defected to Kublai Khan&#x27;s side in the Toluid Civil War. Ariq Böke attacked him and while Alghu experienced initial success in fending off Ariq Böke&#x27;s army, was forced to flee to Samarkand in 1263. Ariq Böke devastated the Ili region in his absence. Alghu was able to recruit a new army with the aid of Orghana and Mas&#x27;ud Yalavach. He then went on to defeat an invasion by Kaidu and drive out Ariq Böke, who surrendered to Kublai in 1264. Alghu died in 1265 and Orghana placed her son, Mubarak Shah, on the throne once again.

Mubarak Shah was the first Chagatai khan to be converted to Islam. His rule was cut short by his cousin Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq, who deposed him with the support of Kublai Khan.

===Reign of Kaidu (1266–1301)===
Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq came into conflict with Kublai Khan on the administration of the Tarim Basin. Baraq drove out an agent sent by Kublai to govern the region and when Kublai sent a detachment of 6,000 horsemen, Baraq met them with 30,000 men, forcing them to retreat. Baraq also came into conflict with Kaidu, who enlisted the Golden Horde khan Mengu-Timur in attacking Baraq. With a Golden Horde army of 50,000 at his back, Kaidu forced Baraq to flee to Transoxania. In 1267, Baraq accepted peace with Kaidu, and relinquished the territory east of Transoxania. Kaidu then coerced Baraq into invading the Ilkhanate. Baraq attacked first, defeating Prince Buchin, the governor of Khorasan, and brother of Abaqa Khan. Abaqa rushed from Azerbaijan and defeated Baraq near Herat on 22 July 1270, forcing him to retreat. On the way back he fell from his horse and was crippled so he spent the winter in Bukhara where he died not long after. He converted to Islam before his death.
Baraq&#x27;s four sons and two sons of Alghu rebelled against Kaidu in the wake of Baraq&#x27;s death, but they were continually defeated. Kaidu enthroned Negübei as the khan in Transoxania. When Negübei rebelled, he was killed and replaced with another khan, Buqa Temür in 1274. It is uncertain when Buqa Temür died, but after that, Baraq&#x27;s son Duwa was enthroned as khan. Meanwhile, Abaqa invaded Transoxania in 1272 and sacked Bukhara, carrying off 50,000 captives.

In 1275, Duwa joined Kaidu in the war against the Yuan dynasty but were repelled. In 1297, Duwa invaded the Punjab and devastated the region, but was defeated. Several invasions of the Delhi Sultanate also occurred but none were able to make any headway. In September 1298, Duwa captured Temür Khan&#x27;s son-in-law, Korguz, and put him to death, but immediately after that suffered a disastrous defeat by Yuan forces. In 1301 they were defeated again in an attack on Karakorum and Kaidu died during the retreat.

===Foreign wars (1301–1325)===

After Kaidu&#x27;s death in 1301, both Duwa and Kaidu&#x27;s son Chapar recognized Yuan authority in 1303. However Duwa threw off his allegiance to Chapar. Both the Yuan dynasty and Duwa attacked Chapar, forcing him to surrender his territory to Duwa in 1306. Meanwhile, Prince Turghai invaded the Delhi Sultanate in 1303 and looted the Delhi region. In 1304 they invaded again but suffered a crushing defeat. Duwa died soon after and was succeeded by his son Könchek, who ruled only for a year and a half before he died. One of Buqa Temür&#x27;s brothers, Taliqu, seized power, but Duwa&#x27;s family rebelled and killed him at a banquet. Duwa&#x27;s younger son Kebek became khan. Kebek invaded the Delhi Sutunate again in 1305, looting the Multan region, but suffered a defeat on the way back. Chapar took advantage of the political turmoil to attack Kebek but was defeated and fled to the Yuan dynasty. Another kuriltai was held in the Chagatai Khanate, which elected another of Duwa&#x27;s sons, Esen Buqa I, who took the throne ceded by Kebek. In 1315, Esen Buqa invaded the Ilkhanate in support of Duwa&#x27;s grandson, Dawud Khoja, who had set himself up in eastern Afghanistan. He defeated an Ilkhanate army on the Murgab and reached as far as Herat, but was forced to retreat when the Yuan dynasty attacked him from the east. The Yuan army devastated the Issyk-Kul region. In 1315 the Chagatayid prince Yasa&#x27;ur defected to the Ilkhanate, only to rebel, taking Khorasan. Both Chagatai and Ilkhanate forces attacked Yasa&#x27;ur. He was killed as he fled. Esen Buqa I died in 1318, at which point Kebek returned to power. He made peace with the Ilkhanate and the Yuan dynasty and reigned until 1325.

===Religious conflict (1325–1338)===

Kebek was succeeded by his three brothers in succession. Eljigidey and Duwa Temür each reigned for only a few months. Tarmashirin (1326–1334) converted to Islam and raided the Delhi Sultanate, reaching as far as Delhi. Tarmashirin was brought down by an anti-Muslim rebellion of the eastern tribes. A son of Duwa, Changshi, was enthroned in 1335. One of his sons was baptized.

Pope Benedict XII appointed the Franciscan bishop Richard of Burgundy to Almalik in 1339. But during the reign of &#x27;Ali-Sultan, Islam fully absorbed the Chagatai Mongols and &#x27;Ali persecuted non-Muslim religions. He is the one who ordered the extermination of the Franciscan congregation at Almaliq, and the killing of six Franciscan monks in 1339 (including bishop Richard of Burgundy, Pascal of Spain, Raymond of Provence and three others), as depicted in the 1342 painting &quot;The Martyrdom of the Franciscans&quot;, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti.

Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli, a papal legate, arrived in the Ili valley the following year on his way to the Yuan dynasty. He built a church and baptized some people during his stay, and the presence of Christianity lasted until the end of the Mongol era.

===Fragmentation and expansion (1338–1363)===

The khanate became increasingly unstable in the following years and split in two during the 1340s. Transoxania was ruled by Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur. In 1346 a tribal chief, Amir Qazaghan, killed Qazan and set up Danishmendji as puppet khan. Danishmendji was killed a year later and replaced with Bayan Qulï. Qazaghan made Herat a tributary in 1351. He was assassinated in 1357 and was succeeded by his son Abdullah, who killed Bayan Qulï in 1358. This aroused the anger of local lords such as Hajji Beg, the uncle of Tamerlane. Hajji drove out Abdullah to the Hindu Kush, where he died. From then on the Chagatayid khans of Transoxania served as nothing more but figureheads until it was annexed by the Timurid Empire. The Timurids likewise continued to portray descendants of Chaghatai khans as khans (i.e. rulers) but in reality they were confined in their castles with no authority. They were political prisoners in Samarkand.

In the east, the powerful Dughlats enthroned a son of Esen Buqa I, Tughlugh Timur as khan of Moghulistan in 1347. In 1350, Tughlugh converted to Islam. Hajji split Transoxania with Bayan Selduz but they were unable to stabilize the realm and it fell into disarray. In 1360, Tughlugh invaded Transoxania and conquered it. Hajji Beg fled in the face of overwhelming power. The future conqueror Timur entered Tughlugh&#x27;s service and was appointed ruler of Shahr-i Sebz. After Tughlugh left Transoxania, Hajji Beg returned in force, only to be driven away again by Tughlugh. Hajji Beg was killed near Sebzewar. Tughlugh expanded his territory into Afghanistan by defeating Amir Husayn. Thus the Chagatai Khanate was restored under Tughlugh.

Following Tughlugh&#x27;s death in 1363, Timur and Amir Husayn took over Transoxiana. Timur and Amir Husayn forced Tughlugh&#x27;s successor Ilyas Khoja out of Transoxania, and then Timur eliminated Amir Husayn as well, gaining mastery over Transoxiana (1369–1405). Like his predecessors, Timur maintained a puppet khan (Soyurgatmish) on the throne to legitimize his rule, but his khans were members of the house of Ögedei rather than descendants of Chagatai.

===Moghulistan (1363–1487)===

Ilyas Khoja attacked Timur in 1364 and defeated him on the north bank of the Syr Darya. He then besieged Samarkand but suffered harsh attrition due to an epidemic so that by the next year he was forced to retreat from Transoxania. The Dughlat Qamar-ud-din Khan Dughlat rebelled and killed Ilyas Khoja in 1368, taking the throne for himself. Ilyas Khoja&#x27;s brother Khizr Khoja fled to Turpan where he set up his own independent realm and converted the last Uyghurs there to Islam. In 1375, Timur invaded Moghulistan, looting the Ili region. Qamar retaliated by raiding Fergana until Timur put him to flight. Timur fell into an ambush and barely escaped, retreating to Samarkand. Timur attacked again in 1376 and 1383 but both times failed to capture the Moghul khan. In 1389 Timur attacked Khizr Khoja instead and forced him to flee into the Gobi Desert. In 1390 Timur invaded Moghulistan and once again failed to find Qamar, but Qamar, having fled, was never heard of again. Khizr Khoja returned to Moghulistan and assumed power once more. He gave his daughter in marriage to Timur and made peace with him in 1397. Khizr Khoja died in 1399 and was succeeded by his three sons in succession: Shams-i-Jahan (1399–1408), Muhammad Khan (1408–1415), and Naqsh-i-Jahan (1415–1418). Upon Khizr Khoja&#x27;s death, Timur took the opportunity to send another army to pillage Moghul lands.

Uwais Khan came to power in 1418. During his reign he waged war on the Oirats and was taken prisoner by their leader Esen Taishi. Due to Uwais&#x27; royal lineage, Esen Taishi treated him with respect and released him. Uwais suffered two more defeats against the Oirats and was captured a second time. He was let go after sending his sister as hostage to Esen Taishi&#x27;s family. Uwais died in 1429. Two factions supporting his two sons Yunus Khan and Esen Buqa II quarreled over the throne with Esen Buqa II emerging as the victor. Yunus fled to Samarkand. Under Esen Buqa II, the powerful Dughlat Sayyid Ali, who had helped him to the throne, became very influential and held both Kucha and Kashgar. In 1451, Esen Buqa II raided the northern border of the Timurid Empire.

The Timurid ruler Abu Sa&#x27;id Mirza schemed to split the Moghuls in two, so he summoned Yunus in 1456 and supported his authority in the Ili region. Yunus tried to conquer Kashgar but was repelled by Sayyid Ali and Esen Buqa II. Esen Buqa II died in 1462. His son Dost Muhammad was an inexperienced 17 year old. He plundered the territory of the Dughlats. By the time he died in 1469, his realm was in general revolt. Yunus took advantage of the situation to capture the Moghul capital Aksu. Dost Muhammad&#x27;s young son Kebek Sultan was taken to Turpan, where he was proclaimed khan. Four years later, he was put to death by his followers and brought to Yunus. Yunus thus became the sole ruler of Moghulistan in 1472.

Yunus&#x27; reign began with a raid by the Oirats under Esen Taishi&#x27;s son Amasanj, who forced Yunus to flee to the Syr Darya. Yunus returned after the Oirats left with their pillage. In 1465, Yunus faced a rebellion by Mirza Abu Bakr Dughlat, who seized Yarkand and Khotan. Yunus attempted twice to remove to Abu Bakr but was defeated both times in 1479 and 1480, after which Abu Bakr also seized Kashgar. In the west, Yunus captured Hami from Kara Del, which was then a tributary of the Ming dynasty. A Ming army evicted the Moghuls from the city but failed to catch them, and they soon returned to Hami afterwards. Yunus also took advantage of political infighting in the west to vassalize Umar Shaikh Mirza II&#x27;s realm in Fergana. Yunus moved to Tashkent in 1484 and settled down, giving up the nomadic way of life. His nomadic followers became alarmed by this action and departed for the steppes, taking with them Yunus&#x27; second son Ahmad Alaq. When Yunus died in 1486, his realm was divided between the Yarkent Khanate, ruled by Mahmud Khan in the west, and the Turpan Khanate, ruled by Ahmad Alaq in the northeast.

===Yarkent and Turpan Khanates (1487–1705)===
====Yarkent Khanate (1487–1705)====

In the west, Mahmud Khan ruled from Tashkent over the Yarkent Khanate. In 1488, the Timurids of Samarkand tried to recover Tashkent but were defeated by Mahmud. In 1487, Mahmud gave refuge to Muhammad Shaybani, who then seized Bukhara and Samarkand from the Timurids in 1500, making himself ruler of Transoxania. Muhammad immediately turned against Mahmud, who called his brother Ahmad Alaq for help, and defeated both the Moghul khans and took them prisoner. He released them soon after but kept Tashkent and Sairam. Ahmad died soon after. Mahmud was captured again in 1508 and put to death, marking the last time the Chagatayids were ejected from Transoxania.

In 1514, Mansur Khan&#x27;s brother Sultan Said Khan captured Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan from Mirza Abu Bakr Dughlat, who had ruled in Mahmud&#x27;s absence, and forced him to flee to Ladakh. This marked the final separation of Moghulistan into two realms, with Said situated in Kashgar, and Mansur in Turpan, otherwise known as Uyghuristan. In 1529, Said attacked Badakhshan, and in 1531, he invaded Ladakh. During the campaign, Said fell ill from altitude sickness and died in July 1533 on the homeward journey. He was succeeded by his son Abdurashid Khan. Abdurashid came into conflict with the Dughlats and persecuted one of their leaders, Sayyid Muhammad-mirza. Abdurashid spent his reign fighting the Kyrgyz people and the Kazakhs, who made incursions on the Ili region and Issyk Kul. He was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the Kyrgyz-Kazakhs from seizing the Ili region. Abdurashid was succeeded in 1565 by his son Abdul Karim Khan, who shifted the capital to Yarkand. Abdul was succeeded in 1590 by his brother Muhammad Sultan, who repelled an invasion by the Khanate of Bukhara under Abdullah Khan II. Muhammad died in 1610 and was succeeded by his son Shudja ad Din Ahmad Khan, who was assassinated in 1619, and replaced by Abd al-Latif (Afak) Khan. Abd al-Latif (Afak) Khan was succeeded by his nephew Sultan Ahmad Khan (Pulat Khan) in 1631. Pulat was overthrown by Abdallah (Moghul Khan) in 1636. Abdallah stabilized the court and exiled a number of old nobles to India. He repelled Oirat inroads in the Khotan and Aksu regions, and entered a tributary relationship with the Qing dynasty in 1655. Friendly relations were also established with Bukhara and the Mughal Empire. In 1667, Abdallah&#x27;s son Yulbars Khan removed his father from power.
From the late 16th century onward, the Yarkent Khanate fell under the influence of the Khojas. The Khojas were Muslims who claimed descent from Muhammad or from the first four Arab caliphs. By the reign of Said in the early 16th century, the Khojas already had a strong influence in court and over the khan. In 1533, an especially influential Khoja named Makhdum-i Azam arrived in Kashgar, where he settled and had two sons. These two sons hated each other and they passed down their mutual hatred down to their children. The two lineages came to dominate large parts of the khanate, splitting it between two factions: the Aq Taghliq (White Mountain) in Kashgar and the Qara Taghliq (Black Mountain) in Yarkand. Yulbars patronized the Aq Taghliqs and suppressed the Qara Taghliqs, which caused much resentment, and resulted in his assassination in 1670. He was succeeded by his son who ruled for only a brief period before Ismail Khan was enthroned. Ismail reversed the power struggle between the two Muslim factions and drove out the Aq Taghliq leader, Afaq Khoja. Afaq fled to Tibet, where the 5th Dalai Lama aided him in enlisting the help of Galdan Boshugtu Khan, ruler of the Dzungar Khanate.

In 1680, Galdan led 120,000 Dzungars into the Yarkent Khanate. They were aided by the Aq Taghliqs and Hami and Turpan, which had already submitted to the Dzungars. Ismail&#x27;s son Babak Sultan died in the resistance against them in the battle for Kashgar. The general Iwaz Beg died in the defense of Yarkand. The Dzungars defeated the Moghul forces without much difficulty and took Ismail and his family prisoner. Galdan installed Abd ar-Rashid Khan II, son of Babak, as puppet khan. The new khan forced Afaq Khoja to flee again, but Abd ar-Rashid&#x27;s reign was also ended unceremoniously two years later when riots erupted in Yarkand. He was replaced by his brother Muhammad Imin Khan. Muhammad sought help from the Qing dynasty, Khanate of Bukhara, and the Mughal Empire in combating the Dzungars. In 1693, Muhammad conducted a successful attack on the Dzungar Khanate, taking 30,000 captives. Unfortunately Afaq Khoja appeared again and overthrew Muhammad in a revolt led by his followers. Afaq&#x27;s son Yahiya Khoja was enthroned but his reign was cut short in 1695 when both he and his father were killed while suppressing local rebellions. In 1696, Akbash Khan was placed on the throne, but the begs of Kashgar refused to recognize him, and instead allied with the Kyrgyz to attack Yarkand, taking Akbash prisoner. The begs of Yarkand went to the Dzungars, who sent troops and ousted the Kyrgyz in 1705. The Dzungars installed a non-Chagatayid ruler Mirza Alim Shah Beg, thereby ending the rule of Chagatai khans forever.

====Turpan Khanate (1487–1570)====

Ahmad Alaq&#x27;s reduced nomadic realm (known as the Turpan Khanate) came into frequent conflict with the Oirats, Kyrgyz people, and Kazakhs. According to the &quot;Tarikh-i Rashidi&quot;, the Oirats called him &quot;Alasha&quot;, &quot;the Killer&quot;. In 1482, Hami was restored to Kara Del under Qanšin, but in 1488, Ahmad killed Qanšin and retook the city. The next year Ahmad was driven out of Hami. In 1493, Ahmad captured Kara Del&#x27;s ruler Šamba and held him prisoner. Šamba received support from the Ming dynasty, which closed its borders to Turpan and expelled its traders from their markets, which eventually forced Ahmad to give up his ambitions in Hami due to unrest in his realm. In 1499 Ahmad retook Kashgar and Yengisar from Mirza Abu Bakr Dughlat.
Around 1500, Muhammad Shaybani attacked Ahmad&#x27;s brother Mahmud Khan, who appealed to Ahmad for help. Muhammad defeated both Ahmad and Mahmud, seizing Tashkent and Sairam. Ahmad was captured but released soon after. He died of paralysis in Aksu a year later. His brother Mansur Khan succeeded him. His reign began with difficulties with the powerful Dughlat of Kashgar, Mirza Abu Bakr Dughlat, plundering the cities of Kucha and Aksu. In 1514, Mansur&#x27;s brother Sultan Said Khan captured Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan from Abu Bakr and forced him to flee to Ladakh. This marked the final separation of Moghulistan into two realms, with Said situated in Kashgar, and Mansur in Turpan, otherwise known as Uyghuristan.

In 1513, Kara Del submitted to Mansur and in 1517 Mansur moved to Hami permanently, where he launched raids against the Ming dynasty. Mansur was succeeded in 1545 by his son Shah Khan. Shah fought with his brother Muhammad, who seized part of Hami and allied with the Oirats. Shah died in 1560 and Muhammad succeeded him. Muhammad had to fight against a third brother, Sufi Sultan, who tried to enlist the Ming in support of his claim to the throne. After Muhammad&#x27;s death in 1570, the Turpan Khanate faded from historical texts. The last thing heard of them are embassies sent from Turpan to Beijing in 1647 and 1657. The Qing dynasty regarded them as embassies from a genuine Chagatayid.

==Government==

The Chagatai Mongols remained mostly nomadic in their mode of government and did not settle down in urban centers until the late 15th century. The Mongols of the Chagatai Khanate treated the urban dwellers of Transoxiana and the Tarim Basin as dependencies.

<doc id="952729" wikidata="Q569289" url="?curid=952729" title="Fluyt">
<text>A fluyt (archaic Dutch: fluijt &quot;flute&quot;; ) is a Dutch type of sailing vessel originally designed by the shipwrights of Hoorn as a dedicated cargo vessel. Originating in the Dutch Republic in the 16th century, the vessel was designed to facilitate transoceanic delivery with the maximum of space and crew efficiency. Unlike rivals, it was not built for conversion in wartime to a warship, so it was simpler and cheaper to build and carried twice the cargo, and could be handled by a smaller crew. Construction by specialized shipyards using new tools made it half the cost of rival ships. These factors combined to sharply lower the cost of transportation for Dutch merchants, giving them a major competitive advantage, particularly with bulk goods. The fluyt was a significant factor in the 17th-century rise of the Dutch seaborne empire. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping—about half the European total.

==Ship design==
The standard fluyt design minimized or completely eliminated its armaments to maximize available cargo space, and used block and tackle extensively to facilitate ship operations. Another advantage of its pear-shape (when viewed from the fore or aft) was a shallow draft which allowed the vessel to bring cargo in and out of ports and up and down rivers which other vessels could not reach. This ship class was credited for making the Dutch more competitive in international trade, and was widely employed by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, its usefulness caused the fluyt to gain such popularity that similar designs were soon developed by seagoing competitors of the Dutch. For example, the English shipbuilding industry began to adapt the design of the fluyt during the later part of the 17th century as English merchants, seeing how much cheaper Dutch shipping was, acquired Dutch-built ships captured in the Anglo-Dutch wars.

The design of the fluyt evolved from the early galleon, to which it bore a resemblance; the galleon, developed in Spain, was also built in the Netherlands, then under the same monarchs. Fluyts typically had a displacement of 200 to 300 tons and were approximately in length.

It is a persistent myth that the fluyt was developed to evade Sound Tolls. The toll registers, however, show that during the 70 years from 1562 to 1632 it was a well-established procedure in the Sound for the toll-officers to use the bills of lading to determine the loading-capacities of the vessels passing through. They did not employ any sort of measuring device to assess the width, length, and depth of the vessels and then calculate the size of the ships.

The fluyt was square rigged with two or three masts. When rigged with three masts, the fore and main (front two) masts were square rigged, with the mizzen (rearmost) mast often rigged with a triangular lateen sail, as pictured above. Masts were much higher than those of galleons to allow for greater speed. At times fluyts were also armed and served as auxiliary vessels, which was a common practice in the Baltic Sea.

== &quot;The Swan&quot; ==
In 2003, Martin Mattenik and Deep Sea Productions, using side scanning sonar, discovered a shipwreck lying on the floor of the Baltic Sea. The wreck was visited five times between 2003 and 2010. The Baltic is unusual in that there is a thick layer of fresh water inhospitable to saltwater-loving shipworms and shipwrecks are protected from the ravages of shipworms. The top of the wreck&#x27;s rudder is decorated with three flowers which is typical of Dutch-built ships of the era. This ship is believed to be named the Swan due to the sculpted body of a swan found in the wreckage. At the time it was customary to attach a figure depicting the name of the ship to the transom. Dutch fluyts were built and used in the 16th and 17th centuries as a contract-for-hire vessel. England had not yet established its own large-scale shipbuilding industry and the Dutch dominated the market. During the 17th century, English companies leased ships like the &quot;Swan&quot; to carry colonists to America.

==Replicas==

The &quot;Hector&quot;, constructed in Pictou, Nova Scotia, and launched in 2000, is a replica of an early 18th-century fluyt which, in the summer of 1773 carried 189 Scottish immigrants to Nova Scotia. The replica was constructed according to line drawings from the Maritime Museum Rotterdam, and built using traditional shipbuilding techniques. As of 2017, the &quot;Hector&quot; is operated by the Hector Quay Society and is open to the public.

<doc id="952748" wikidata="Q7357094" url="?curid=952748" title="Rodney Trotter">
<text>Rodney Charlton Trotter (also known as Dave by Trigger) is a fictional character in the long running BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, played by Nicholas Lyndhurst.

==Biography==
Rodney Charlton Trotter was born on 2 November 1960 to Joan Trotter (nee Hollins) and Freddie ‘ The Frog ‘ Robdal. His presumed father is Reg Trotter.
Rodney is the son of Joan Mavis Trotter, grandson of Edward Trotter, and great nephew of Albert Trotter.

His full name is Rodney Charlton Trotter. In &quot;Little Problems&quot; it is revealed that Rodney is named after &quot;handsome actor&quot; Rod Taylor and Charlton after Charlton Athletic, his mother&#x27;s favourite football team.

Rodney is the younger brother of Derek Trotter, who affectionately refers to him as &quot;Rodders&quot;. Rodney has supported Del with all his schemes, but is not as confident as his brother. Del&#x27;s comments whenever Rodney makes a mistake, including &quot;Plonker&quot;, &quot;Wally&quot;, &quot;Twonk&quot;, &quot;Dipstick&quot; and &quot;Tart&quot;, became notable catchphrases throughout the series. It is revealed in numerous episodes such as &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;The Long Legs of the Law&quot;, and &quot;A Royal Flush&quot; that Rodney is appalled by Del&#x27;s behaviour, including lying to girls they want to date.

Throughout the series, Rodney&#x27;s presumed father was Reg Trotter, although his actual paternity was occasionally called into question, such as in the 1987 Christmas special &quot;The Frog&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, due to the unavoidable fact that he shared little resemblance to either Del or Reg in terms of appearance or personality. In the final &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; episode, the 2003 Christmas special &quot;Sleepless in Peckham&quot;, Rodney discovered through an old photograph of the first Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing that he and Del did not actually share the same father. His biological father was revealed to be local gentleman thief, Freddie &quot;The Frog&quot; Robdal, who had an affair with Del and Rodney&#x27;s mother Joan in March 1960, and Rodney instantly deduced this due to Robdal&#x27;s striking resemblance to him. This is confirmed in the prequel series &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. In the episode&#x27;s final scene, Rodney asks Del if he is anything like Freddie Robdal, but Del denies it, labelling Robdal several derogatory terms such as &quot;thief&quot;, &quot;conman&quot;, &quot;liar&quot; and a &quot;cheat&quot;, none of which apply to Rodney.

===Age===
The BBC comedy guide for &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; clearly states that Rodney&#x27;s birthday is 26 February; however, this is contradicted in &quot;Sleepless in Peckham&quot;, when Cassandra mistakes Freddie the Frog in an old 1960s photo of the first Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing for Rodney. Rodney corrects her, claiming that the photo was taken in July 1960 before he was born (according to Rodney), thus making Rodney&#x27;s date of birth the date he reveals it to be in &quot;The Unlucky Winner Is...&quot;, 2 November. This is confirmed when Rodney&#x27;s birth is shown in &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;.

However, some episodes of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; do not support this; in &quot;Big Brother&quot;, 1981, Rodney states to Del that he is 23 years of age, which would make his year of birth 1957 or 1958. In the same episode Del Boy states that there is a thirteen-year age gap between himself and Rodney. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t be like any other little brother could you eh, and come along a couple of years later after me. Oh no no, not you. You had to wait thirteen years!&quot; In the following episode &quot;Go West Young Man&quot;, which was broadcast in September 1981 (and was the second episode of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; ever broadcast), Del Boy states that he (Del) is 35. In &quot;Big Brother&quot; since Rodney had said he was 23, Rodney must already have had his birthday that year with Del still to have his 36th birthday later that year. Therefore, Rodney must have been born during 1958. In &quot;Healthy Competition&quot;, which was broadcast in the November of 1983, Rodney says that he is twenty four years old. Therefore the year of his birth is either 1958 or 1959. In &quot;As One Door Closes&quot;, set in early 1985, Rodney tells Del that he is 24, making his year of birth 1960. In &quot;Yuppy Love&quot;, Del states that the Trotter family have been living at Nelson Mandela House since 1962, and that Rodney was born in the flat. Similarly, Rodney &amp; Cassandra&#x27;s wedding certificate shows that they were married on 25 January 1989 and gives Rodney&#x27;s age as 26 and Cassandra&#x27;s as 21. This would make Rodney born in 1962 (assuming he hadn&#x27;t yet had a birthday before his wedding in 1989) and during &quot;Modern Men&quot; (set around Christmas 1996), Mickey Pearce describes Rodney as a &quot;34-year-old paperboy&quot;, which would also back up a birth year of 1962. However, during &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;, set around Christmas 1992, Rodney states that he is 31, suggesting he was born in 1961.

=== Early life ===
Del claimed in &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot; that Rodney was still being breastfed until he was three and a half years old. As a child, Rodney was &quot;all snot and Marmite&quot; with a &quot;funny haircut&quot;. Unlike Del, Rodney went to grammar school, where he received GCEs in Art and Mathematics. Del often asks Rodney questions, saying &#x27;You&#x27;re the one with GCEs!&#x27;. He was subsequently expelled from art college in Basingstoke after three weeks for smoking cannabis in a fellow student&#x27;s room. He was fined £250 and given an eighteen-month suspended sentence for possession of cannabis.

===Career===
With only two GCEs and a criminal record, Del gave Rodney a job as an assistant market trader (or &quot;Financial Advisor&quot;) and dogsbody, knowing that he was unlikely to get a decent job anywhere else due to his past mistakes. Rodney&#x27;s main duty was checking for the police while Del would be illegally selling his merchandise in the market. In early episodes, Rodney was angered by this, and also by the fact that he had a menial job and lived in a shambolic flat.

Rodney took over from Del in 2001 when he was declared bankrupt, forbidding him from running a company. When &quot;Trotters Independent Traders&quot; was about to cease operating, Del knew that Rodney was not banned from managing a firm and so after two decades as an assistant market trader, Rodney finally got promoted to titular Managing Director, but this did not stop Del from trying to control the company.

For some time, Rodney worked as Financial Director of T.I.T.CO (a job which included such executive tasks as loading the van). Rodney has principles and is often disgusted by Del&#x27;s business activities, such as dealing in stolen goods. Despite his moral objections, Rodney is usually persuaded into Del&#x27;s money-making schemes by Del&#x27;s smooth-talking manipulation and the possibility of financial rewards.

===Marriage to Cassandra===
Rodney found a kindred-spirit in Cassandra, whom he met at a computer training course in &quot;Yuppy Love&quot;. He lied to her that he lived in the upmarket King&#x27;s Avenue in order to impress her; however, she later found out where he lived when she phoned Nelson Mandela House. When he met Cassandra, it gave him a chance to move on in life, which resulted in his leaving Del behind. They married in 1989 in the episode &quot;Little Problems&quot;.

Her father Alan employed Rodney at his company, Parry Print Ltd. (at least until Rodney accidentally quit that job), and, with some financial assistance from Del, he was able to buy a flat and finally move out of Nelson Mandela House. Their marriage suffered when Rodney assaulted Cassandra&#x27;s boss, and broke his nose, upon returning from Margate in &quot;The Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing&quot;. They separated in the 1990 Christmas special &quot;Rodney Come Home&quot;, and throughout the seventh series attempted to save their marriage; in &quot;The Chance of a Lunchtime&quot; Del played matchmaker, in order for them to re-unite. This worked, until Rodney was seen by Cassandra with one of Del&#x27;s ex-fiancées, when he was accompanying her to a taxi because she was drunk. In &quot;Three Men, a Woman and a Baby&quot;, Cassandra told Rodney that it was all over between them, until her mum insisted she should see their solicitor for advice, who told her that they should talk. He stayed the night but they were interrupted by Del phoning to say Raquel had gone into labour.

In &quot;Miami Twice&quot;, it was revealed that the two were living together on weekends as they tried to repair their relationship. In &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;, they were fully reconciled. They had been trying for a baby ever since, so when it was announced in &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; that Cassandra was pregnant, everyone was jubilant. However she miscarried at the end of the following episode; &quot;Modern Men&quot;. In the last episode, &quot;Sleepless in Peckham&quot;, Cassandra gave birth to a girl, whom Rodney named Joan after his late mother.

Rodney lives with Cassandra, their daughter Joan, Del, Del&#x27;s &quot;significant other&quot; Raquel and their son Damien at Flat 368 on the twelfth floor of the fictional Nelson Mandela House on the Nyerere Estate, Peckham, London in 2003, but Del&#x27;s autobiography states that barely a month after receiving their fortune from Uncle Albert&#x27;s will, Rodney and Cassandra had got their own flat.

===Personality===
Rodney&#x27;s personality was based on the experiences of series creator John Sullivan, who also had an older brother and claimed to have been, like Rodney, a slacker and an idealist in his youth, but struggled with confidence and was supported by his sibling.

===Catchphrases===
The only running phrase Rodney uses is the word &quot;cosmic&quot; to describe something good or impressive, either in a sentence or exclamation form. More often than not, he uses this expression sarcastically, such as when being caught in a downpour without a raincoat that fits (&quot;Yuppy Love&quot;), or upon hearing a set of wardrobe doors acquired by Del were stolen (&quot;As One Door Closes&quot;). However, he frequently calls Del a &quot;git&quot; in the same way as Del would call him a &quot;plonker&quot;, &quot;wally&quot; or &quot;dipstick&quot;.

===Dave===
The name &quot;Dave&quot; is bestowed upon him by Trigger, the only character to refer to him as such, and was born from a one-line joke in the very first episode, &quot;Big Brother&quot;. This became a long-running joke throughout the entire series.

No matter how many times Trigger was told Rodney&#x27;s name, he continued to call him Dave. One instance was in &quot;Three Men, a Woman and a Baby&quot;, Rodney tells Trigger that if Del and Raquel&#x27;s baby is a boy, they will name it Rodney after him. Trigger then tells Mike, the landlord of The Nags Head pub, who is holding a &quot;Guess the baby name&quot; competition, that &quot;If it&#x27;s a boy, they&#x27;re naming him Rodney, after Dave&quot;. Another instance was portrayed in &quot;Modern Men&quot;, when Mike announced a toast to future Mum and Dad &quot;Cassandra and Rodney&quot;; everyone said &quot;Cassandra and Rodney&quot;, but Trigger could be heard shouting &quot;Dave&quot; after everyone else stops talking. In &quot;Homesick&quot;, Rodney did tell Trigger to his face that his name was Rodney and not Dave. Trigger seemed to understand but almost immediately started calling him Dave again, and also refers to him as this when Rodney is not around.

===Personal life===
In the episode &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock And Roll&quot;, Rodney is a drummer in a band fronted by &quot;Mental&quot; Mickey Maguire. Despite their terrible musical abilities, Del convinces the band that by having him as their manager they will go on to become a big success. Having secured a booking at a local pub for St Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations, the night ends in disaster with a fight breaking out. Having convinced Rodney that the band is going nowhere, he finally quits, leaving the remaining four to continue without him. However, one evening back in their flat, Del turns on the TV to find Rodney&#x27;s old band performing on &quot;Top of The Pops&quot;.

Rodney had recurring nightmares about his nephew Damien. He was convinced that he was going to be the son of Satan.

It is implied in some episodes that Rodney is a Chelsea supporter. In &quot;The Long Legs of the Law&quot;, Del remarks that ICI have dropped a point, to which Rodney replies that &quot;Chelsea dropped three on Saturday!&quot; In a later episode, &quot;A Royal Flush&quot;, he takes Victoria to see a football match at Stamford Bridge.

==Reception==
&quot;Rise to Rebellion&quot; received generally positive reviews for its vivid portrayal of the historical events of the American Revolution. &quot;Booklist&quot; praised it as &quot;an exciting evocation of events leading up to the formation of America,&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; appreciated the book&#x27;s &quot;passion and vigor.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews,&quot; however, called the work &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;disappointing,&quot; saying that the characters were &quot;all so burdened by the task of providing the reader with huge dollops of sedulously digested information that Shaara neglects to give them any individual reality.&quot;

&quot;Rise to Rebellion&quot; spent six weeks on the New York Times fiction bestsellers list from July to August 2001. It peaked at No. 9 on the list in the week of July 22, 2001.

<doc id="952773" wikidata="Q5453399" url="?curid=952773" title="First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti">
<text>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978), is a U.S. constitutional law case which defined the free speech right of corporations for the first time. The United States Supreme Court held that corporations have a First Amendment right to make contributions to ballot initiative campaigns. The ruling came in response to a Massachusetts law that prohibited corporate donations in ballot initiatives unless the corporation&#x27;s interests were directly involved.

In 1976 several corporations, including the First National Bank of Boston, were barred from contributing to a Massachusetts referendum regarding tax policy and subsequently sued. The case was successfully appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in November 1977. On April 26, 1978, the Court ruled 5–4 against the Massachusetts law.

As a result of the ruling, states could no longer impose specific regulations on donations from corporations in ballot initiative campaigns. While the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision did not directly affect federal law, it has been cited by other Supreme Court cases such as &quot;McConnell v. FEC&quot; and &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;.

==Background==

===Corporate funds and federal elections===
Since the early 1900s, federal law has prohibited the use of corporate funds to influence federal elections. In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act, prohibiting corporations and national banks from contributing to federal campaigns. Forty years later, the Taft-Hartley Act banned direct election contributions by labor unions and corporations to federal elections.

In 1971, the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) initiated sweeping reforms by requiring full reporting of contributions to federal elections. In 1974, amendments to the FECA created the Federal Election Commission and enacted stricter limits on election contributions and expenditures.

That same year, &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; challenged the 1974 FECA amendments in the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that they violated the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantees of free speech. The Court, introducing the concept of spending money as a form of unrestricted political speech, overturned limits on campaign expenditures. However, it upheld contribution limits because such limits served the government&#x27;s interest in reducing election corruption.

===Before the Massachusetts Supreme Court===
In 1976, Massachusetts passed Massachusetts General Laws ch. 55 § 8, which expanded the 1974 FECA amendment&#x27;s prohibitions. The new criminal statute disallowed the use of &quot;corporate funds to purchase advertising to influence the outcome of referendum elections, unless the corporation&#x27;s business interests were directly involved.&quot;

That same year, Massachusetts proposed a constitutional amendment (to be voted upon in a referendum election) modifying income tax laws. The First National Bank of Boston, New England Merchants National Bank, the Gillette Co., Digital Equipment Corp., and Wyman-Gordon claimed that this amendment affected their business interests and that they should be allowed to spend corporate funds on relevant advertising. The Massachusetts Attorney General&#x27;s Office, applying Massachusetts General Laws. ch. 55 § 8, disagreed.

In response, the corporations sued Massachusetts Attorney General Francis Bellotti, the Coalition for Tax Reform, and United Peoples, Inc., contending that Massachusetts General Law ch. 55 § 8 was unconstitutional because it violated their right to free speech. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts heard &quot;The First National Bank of Boston &amp; others v. Attorney General &amp; others&quot; on June 8, 1976.

On February 1, 1977, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in favor of the defendants, stating that Massachusetts General Laws ch. 55 § 8 was constitutionally applied because of a failure to find a material effect on the corporations&#x27; business interests. The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court.

==Before the Supreme Court==
The U.S. Supreme Court heard &quot;First National Bank of Boston et al. v. Bellotti, Attorney General of Massachusetts&quot;, on November 9, 1977.

Francis H. Fox presented the oral arguments on behalf the appellant, the First National Bank of Boston in representation of national banking associations and business corporations. E. Susan Garsh joined him on the briefs. Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General Thomas R. Kiley spoke during oral argument for the appellee. The Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti and Assistant Attorney General Stephen Schultz joined him on the brief. Main issues addressed during oral arguments included corporations as persons, the scope of freedom of speech, and the power of the states.

The Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Inc. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed briefs of amici curiae supporting a reversal of the lower courts&#x27; ruling. The Federal Election Commission filed briefs of amici curiae supporting an affirmation of the constitutionality of the statue. The State of Montana, the New England Council, and the Pacific Legal Foundation also filed amicus briefs. The Northeastern Legal Foundation&#x27;s motion to file a brief was denied.

==Opinions of the Court==

===Overview===
The Supreme Court issued its decision on April 26, 1978, with a 5-to-4 majority vote in favor of the First National Bank of Boston. Justice Powell delivered the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Stewart, Blackmun, and Stevens, with Burger writing a separate concurring opinion. Justice White was joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall in his dissent, with Justice Rehnquist issuing a separate dissent. The Supreme Court ruled that corporations have First Amendment speech protections extending beyond material commercial interests, reversing the decision made by the Massachusetts Supreme Court.

===Majority opinion===
In opinion written by Justice Powell, the court held: 
# the case was not moot because it was one of a category of cases that is &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review;&quot;
# the statute was unconstitutional and the argument that a corporation&#x27;s speech regarding issues not relevant to the business loses its First Amendment protection is invalid.

In its ruling, the Court first considered whether the case was moot. The constitutional amendment that the appellants had opposed had been defeated by the time the case came to the Court&#x27;s attention. The Court used the scrutiny described in &quot;Weinstein v. Bradford&quot; in its determination that the case was not, in fact, moot. The Court&#x27;s rationale was twofold: first, the interval between the amendment&#x27;s proposal and its referendum was too short for complete judicial review to have occurred; and second, the Court found that there was a reasonable expectation that the appellants would be adversely affected by the statute again.

Then, the Supreme Court held that the Massachusetts statute in question violated corporate speech rights protected under the First Amendment. The majority wrote that &quot;commercial speech is accorded some constitutional protection not so much because it pertains to the seller&#x27;s business as because it furthers the societal interest in the &#x27;free flow of commercial information.&#x27;&quot;

The majority opinion asserted that &quot;the inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual.&quot; In deciding the case, the Court rejected the argument that the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to corporations. The Court overruled &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot;, which stated that corporations &quot;cannot claim for themselves the liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees,&quot; declaring the decision to be &quot;untenable under decisions of this Court&quot;. Instead, the Court asserted that the Due Process Clause extends freedom of speech and other First Amendment liberties to corporate entities.

The majority rejected the argument that the First Amendment rights of a corporation derive purely from their business and property interests. Furthermore, the Court asserted that &quot;the Court&#x27;s decisions involving corporations in the business of communication or entertainment are based not only on the role of the First Amendment in fostering individual self-expression, but also on its role in affording the public access to discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas&quot;. The Supreme Court cited &quot;Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council&quot;, in which the Court held that whether &quot;the advertiser&#x27;s interest in a commercial advertisement is purely economic does not disqualify him from protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Both the individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.&quot; The Court found that there was no evidence that corporations lost speech protections if their speech did not materially affect the business of the corporation. Thus, the Court held the statute violated the First Amendment rights of the corporation.

The Court also rejected the claim that the statute was &quot;necessitated by governmental interests of the highest order&quot;. Massachusetts had argued that the statute was necessary for two reasons: first, that the State had a compelling interest in maintaining the role of the individual in the electoral process and that corporate speech would diminish this; and secondly, to protect shareholders of the corporations whose views might differ from those of the corporate management. The majority asserted that neither of these justifications was apparent in the statute. Furthermore, the decision found that there was insufficient evidence that the law was necessary to satisfy the compelling state interest test. As to the latter claim, the Court held that the statute was both underinclusive and overinclusive in regards to shareholders interests.

===Concurrence===
Chief Justice Burger, wrote a separate concurring opinion in order &quot;to raise some questions likely to arise in this area in the future.&quot;

Burger wrote to emphasize the difficulty in differentiating media corporations from other corporate entities. He also pointed out that media conglomerates were a more likely threat than the appellants to the public interests raised by the state of Massachusetts, due to their immense influence. Thus, Burger concluded that &quot;no factual distinction has been identified as yet that would justify government restraints on the right of appellants to express their views without, at the same time, opening the door to similar restraints on media conglomerates with their vastly greater influence&quot;. Burger pointed out that as newspapers merged with global media conglomerates, separating corporations from media had become untenable. Therefore, Burger argued, restrictions on speech such as the Massachusetts statute necessitated a great deal of caution. &quot;In short,&quot; Burger wrote, &quot;the First Amendment does not &#x27;belong&#x27; to any definable category of persons or entities: it belongs to all who exercise its freedoms.&quot;

===Dissents===
A dissenting opinion by Justice White was joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall. In the dissent, White disagreed with the Court&#x27;s opinion that the statute abridges the speech rights of corporations. &quot;By holding that Massachusetts may not prohibit corporate expenditures or contributions made in connection with referendums involving issues having no material connection with the corporate business,&quot; White wrote, &quot;the Court not only invalidates a statute which has been on the books in one form or another for many years, but also casts considerable doubt upon the constitutionality of legislation passed by some 31 States restricting corporate political activity.&quot;

White wrote that the Court had erred in not recognizing that the &quot;state&#x27;s regulatory interests ... were themselves derived from the First Amendment.&quot; Specifically, White claimed that &quot;the state had a first amendment interest in &#x27;assuring that shareholders are not compelled to support and financially further beliefs with which they disagree.&#x27;&quot; The only purpose uniting all shareholders, White argued, is to make a profit. Any issue not related to business interests could diverge from the interests of individual shareholders.

White also argued that states have the ability to prevent threats from corporate entities to the political process. &quot;The State need not permit its own creation to consume it,&quot; White wrote. White noted that the nation had a history of recognizing the need to limit the influence of corporations in the political process, citing &quot;United States v. Auto Workers&quot;, in which the Court held that the primary purpose of a federal act was &quot;to avoid the deleterious influences on federal elections resulting from the use of money by those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital.&quot;

Justice Rehnquist, in a separate dissent, sharply criticized the Court&#x27;s decision. Rehnquist pointed out that, while the issue of whether corporations had the right to voice their opinions on political issues was new to the Court, the constitutional permissibility of restrictions on such speech had been considered and approved by Congress and over thirty states. He argued that this consensus by so many governmental institutionals should not be ignored in the Court&#x27;s decision.

Furthermore, Rehnquist claimed that corporate speech is only protected such as it connects to commercial interests. Rehnquist concluded, &quot;although the Court has never explicitly recognized a corporation&#x27;s right of commercial speech, such a right might be considered necessarily incidental to the business of a commercial corporation. It cannot be so readily concluded that the right of political expression is equally necessary to carry out the functions of a corporation organized for commercial purposes.&quot;

Rehnquist asserted that corporate liberties did not include the right to influence and engage in political issues:

I can see no basis for concluding that the liberty of a corporation to engage in political activity with regard to matters having no material effect on its business is necessarily incidental to the purposes for which the Commonwealth permitted these corporations to be organized or admitted within its boundaries. Nor can I disagree with the Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s factual finding that no such effect has been shown by these appellants. Because the statute as construed provides at least as much protection as the Fourteenth Amendment requires, I believe it is constitutionally valid.

From this conclusion, Rehnquist argued that the dissemination of information to the public is not diminished by restrictions on corporate speech on political topics. Therefore, in his view, &quot;all natural persons ... remain as free as before to engage in political activity.&quot;

==Further Supreme Court rulings==
In 1990, the Supreme Court in &quot;Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce&quot; upheld a state law prohibiting corporate independent expenditures, reasoning that the &quot;government has a strong interest in preventing the wealth of corporations from distorting elections for public office.&quot; The 2003, Supreme Court majority in &quot;McConnell v. Federal Election Commission&quot; &quot;relied on Austin&quot; to preserve new federal campaign restrictions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (2002). In 2010, the Supreme Court in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; overturned &quot;Austin&quot; and returned to the principle established in &quot;Buckley&quot; and &quot;Bellotti&quot; that &quot;the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker&#x27;s corporate identity.&quot;

===&quot;Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce&quot;===
In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce&quot; that even though the First Amendment did protect corporate expression, restrictions on independent expenditure were justified due to the compelling interest to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption in campaigns. The &quot;Austin&quot; majority quoted &quot;Bellotti&quot; in agreeing that political speech did not lose First Amendment protection &quot;merely because the speaker is a corporation.&quot; However, the &quot;Austin&quot; majority held that the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a non-profit corporation that wanted to publish a newspaper advertisement supporting a candidate, did not qualify for the non-profit exemption established in &quot;Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc&quot; (1986). The dissent in the &quot;Austin&quot; case cited the statement in &quot;Bellotti&quot; that &quot;the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue.&quot; The dissent found that Massachusetts&#x27;s law discriminated on the basis of the speaker&#x27;s identity, and argued that the precedents of the Supreme Court, such as &quot;Bellotti&quot;, condemn this type of censorship. Scholars agree that the &quot;Austin&quot; decision was inconsistent with precedent in that the Court had previously never upheld a statue that regulated corporate independent expenditure because of a state interest in preventing corruption.

===&quot;McConnell v. Federal Election Commission&quot;===

In 2002, the Supreme Court in &quot;McConnell v. Federal Election Commission&quot; upheld the two major provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which were the bans on unrestricted &quot;soft money&quot; donations to political parties and on electioneering communications, which are defined as any broadcast that refers to a federal candidate and is aired within a designated time frame of that candidate&#x27;s election. The &quot;McConnell&quot; majority moved away from the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision by allowing such restrictions on corporate donations. The majority accepted legislative judgment that corporate treasuries represent a threat of corruption when deployed directly in candidate elections.&quot; The &quot;McConnell&quot; dissent characterized the &quot;Austin&quot; argument concerning the &quot;corrosive and distorting effects&quot; of corporations as the notion that corporations &quot;will be able to convince voters on the correctness of their ideas.&quot; The dissent argued that using this reasoning, simply &quot;winning the marketplace of ideas&quot; could be considered evidence of corruption. They argued that this conclusion opposed the First amendment, citing the statement from &quot;Bellotti&quot; that &quot;the fact that advocacy may persuade the electorate is hardly a reason to suppress it.&quot;

===&quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;===

In 2010, the Supreme Court in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; overturned &quot;Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce&quot; (1990), portions of &quot;McConnell v. Federal Election Commission&quot; (2003), and Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (2002) that prohibited electioneering communications by corporations. The Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy described the reasoning of the &quot;Citizens&quot; majority as based on two propositions. The first was that the Court has recognized that &quot;First Amendment protections extend to corporations,&quot; for which the Court cited &quot;Bellotti&quot; as an example. The Court &quot;returned to the principle established in &quot;Buckley&quot; and &quot;Bellotti&quot; that the Government may not suppress political speech based on the speaker&#x27;s corporate identity.&quot; The Court cited &quot;Bellotti&quot; in arguing that political speech is &quot;indispensable to decision making in a democracy and [that] this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation.&quot; The second proposition addressed contribution expenditure and corruption. The Court ruled that independent expenditure limits were unconstitutional because, unlike campaign contribution limits, they fail to &quot;serve any substantial government interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process.&quot; The Court argued, &quot;&quot;Austin&quot; upheld a corporate independent expenditure restriction&quot; by recognizing a &quot;new governmental interest&quot; in preventing corruption to &quot;bypass &quot;Buckley&quot; and &quot;Bellotti&quot;.&quot; The Court rejected the anti-distortion reasoning argued in &quot;Austin&quot; and returned to the quid pro quo conception of corruption used in &quot;Buckley&quot;, stating that &quot;independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.&quot; In overruling &quot;Austin&quot;, the &quot;Citizens&quot; majority insisted, &quot;before &quot;Austin&quot;, the court had not allowed the exclusion of a class of speakers from general public dialogue.&quot; The Court did concede that the &quot;Bellotti&quot; case &quot;did not address the constitutionality&quot; of bans on &quot;corporate independent expenditures to support candidates.&quot; However, the court reasoned that such bans &quot;would have been unconstitutional under &quot;Bellotti&#x27;s&quot; central principle that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker&#x27;s corporate identity.&quot;

==Effects on policy==

===Effects on legislation===

While the &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; ruling set a precedent for allowing corporate spending in elections, it did not directly lead to federal campaign law changes because of its narrow focus. The &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision focused on state referendums, not the election of candidates.

In April 1978, when the Supreme Court decided &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,&quot; 31 states had laws regulating corporate spending on ballot initiatives. However, not all of these state laws were annulled by the Supreme Court ruling. Universal caps on donations for ballot initiatives as well as specific bans aimed to prevent &quot;undue&quot; corporate influence on referendums were still considered constitutional. Of these 31 states, 18 of them, including Massachusetts, had laws that would be considered unconstitutional after the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision.

In the aftermath of &quot;Bellotti&quot;, several states changed their laws relating to spending on referendums. In 1981, Iowa&#x27;s state legislature updated their campaign finance laws to state,

It is unlawful for any insurance company, savings and loan association, bank, and or corporation ... to contribute any money, property, labor, or thing of value, directly or indirectly, to any committee, or for the purpose of influencing the vote of any elector, except that such resources may be so expended in connection with a ballot issue, however all such expenditures are subject to the disclosure requirements of this chapter. 

Montana had previously banned all corporate donations for or against ballot issues. In October 1978, this law was overturned by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit citing &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti.&quot;

On December 23, 1986, the General Court of Massachusetts approved a series of changes to its campaign finance laws, and only then officially changed the law governing corporate spending on ballot initiatives. In &quot;An Act Further Regulating Political Campaign Financing,&quot; the General Court stated that they were &quot;striking out&quot; Chapter 55, Section 8, the law annulled by the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision. Furthermore, a new §8 law was written that in part stated,

No person or persons, no political committee, and no person acting under the authority of a political committee, or in its behalf, other than a political committee organized on behalf of a ballot question campaign ... shall solicit or receive from such corporation or such holders of stock any gift, payment, expenditure, contribution or promise to give, pay, expend or contribute for any such purpose. 

===Effects on referendums===

Scholars are split on whether the &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; decision has had an overall effect on the ballot initiative process. Some scholars believe that without any regulations on corporate spending on ballot initiatives, corporations have the potential to donate much more to these campaigns than individuals or citizen groups. Some scholars maintain that this advantage gives corporations undue influence over referendum campaigns and policy outcomes.

One such way corporations can use money to sway voters is through advertising and spreading information about propositions. For example, a California ballot initiative, Proposition 37 from 2012, attracted a disproportionately high level of spending from corporations. The proposition would mandate that all foods containing genetically modified organisms would have to be labeled as such. Corporations including Monsanto and DuPont spent $45 million against Prop 37 - five times more than the money spent by supporters of the proposition. The proposition was defeated by a margin of 51% to 48%, a result that left many pro-Prop 37 groups blaming unfair financing as the reason for the defeat.

Still, other political scientists disagree, believing that there is no definitive evidence that links corporation donations to referendum results. For example, the campaign around California&#x27;s Proposition 188, a ballot initiative aimed at lifting bans on smoking, is another example of unequal spending between corporations and others. Businesses spent over $19,000,000 in favor of Prop 188, while non-businesses spent less than $2,000,000 in opposition. Nevertheless, in this case, voters ultimately voted against Proposition 188.

Similarly, the gambling industry in California has spent tens of millions of dollars since 1912 on referendums regarding gambling rules. However, only 25% of the referendums they have supported monetarily have passed.

==Support and criticism==
&quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; (1978), referred to by Linda Greenhouse as &quot;the most important Supreme Court case no one&#x27;s ever heard of,&quot; did not elicit a very strong reaction from the media and the public. Most of the discourse pertaining to the case relates to the decision&#x27;s effects on the role of money in politics and corporate rights.

===Support===
Those who support the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision saw it as a culmination of constitutional thinking on the issue of corporate political speech. These scholars and lawyers praise the ruling for treating corporate speech as equal as individual speech and thus increasing the information provided to voters during elections.

According supporters, there is a long history of legislative and judicial decisions that justifies the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision. While pre-1900 Supreme Courts believed that corporations did not deserve any protection under the First Amendment, by 1970 some lower courts were beginning to recognize First Amendment protection to &quot;corporate speech.&quot; Lawyer Robert Prentice stated that First Amendment protection for corporations has worked its way into the decisions of the Supreme Court since the 1940s, in cases such as &quot;Valentine v. Chrestensen&quot; (1942), &quot;Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations&quot; (1973) and &quot;Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council&quot; (1976). From 1973 to Chief Justice Burger&#x27;s departure in 1986, &quot;the Burger Court ... invalidated every commercial speech ban considered,&quot; building up precedents for the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision.

Supporters also praise the increase in discourse and available surrounding information about ballot initiatives resulting from the &quot;Bellotti&quot; decision. Lawyer Francis H. Fox wrote, &quot;[the ruling] perceives that the First Amendment&#x27;s purposes are better served by allowing the [free] use of means of communication than by enacting legislation designed to foster equality of access to those means.&quot; Prentice also noted that the Court acted correctly by protecting the rights of listeners to hear all possible pertinent information. This is the &quot;right to receive&quot; doctrine, which interprets the First Amendment as protecting individuals&#x27; right to receive information as part of freedom of communication.

===Criticisms===
Critics condemned &quot;Bellotti&quot; for increasing the influx of corporate money into elections, claiming that this would drown out smaller voices and candidates. Academic George W. Scofield said that corporate speech unrelated to corporate property &quot;becomes the purely personal views of corporate management [and is] undeserving of the constitutional protection afforded by &quot;Bellotti&quot;.&quot;

Former Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit J. Skelly Wright said that the rulings in both the &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; and &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; cases have &quot;given protection to the polluting effect of money in financial campaigns.&quot; Wright advocates for &quot;one person, one vote,&quot; a concept that meshes with Scofield&#x27;s concept of aligning the speech of a corporation and of the individuals composing it.

Some critics point out that commercial interests and public interests are not always aligned, and that investment from corporations for commercial interests can be detrimental to the formation of public opinion. In an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Linda Greenhouse said, &quot;the court&#x27;s speech-protective instincts appear increasingly to serve a deregulatory agenda.&quot;

Additionally, scholar Carl E. Schneider wrote in the Southern California Law Review that the Court&#x27;s opinion agreed with previous opinions on the topic of &quot;legislature attempting to govern the political and social power of the business corporation.&quot; Schneider writes that the Court misinterpreted the First Amendment and had &quot;problems in understanding social reality.&quot;

<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, six swimming events were contested. These were the first Olympic Games in which a 100-metre pool had been especially constructed (inside the main stadium&#x27;s track and field oval). Previous Olympic events were swum in open water (1896: The Mediterranean Sea, 1900: The Seine River, 1904: an artificial lake). Only men participated in the swimming events. The competitions were held from Monday, July 13, 1908, to Saturday, July 25, 1908.

All six of the 1908 events became staples of the Olympic swimming programme, and have been contested at every edition of the Games since. The 50 m, 200 m, and 800 m freestyle events were dropped from the previous edition (though these would later return), the relay was lengthened from 4 × 50 yards to 4 × 200 m, and the 400 m breaststroke was shortened to 200 metres.

Canada and Finland made their first appearances in swimming, while Austria, Hungary, and the United States continued their streaks of appearing each time. Fourteen nations competed in all, with 100 swimmers entering the events.

<doc id="952786" wikidata="Q475704" url="?curid=952786" title="HMS Birkenhead (1845)">
<text>HMS &quot;Birkenhead, also referred to asHM Troopship &quot;Birkenhead or Steam Frigate &quot;Birkenhead&quot;, was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy. She was designed as a steam frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned.

While transporting troops and a few civilians to Algoa Bay, the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was wrecked on 26 February 1852 at Danger Point near Gansbaai, from Cape Town in the Cape Colony. There were insufficient serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood in ranks on board, allowing the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking.

Only 193 of the estimated 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers&#x27; chivalry gave rise to the unofficial &quot;women and children first&quot; protocol when abandoning ship, while the &quot;Birkenhead drill&quot; of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem came to describe courage in the face of hopeless circumstances.

==Description and history==
The &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was laid down at John Laird&#x27;s shipyard at Birkenhead as the frigate HMS &quot;Vulcan&quot;, but renamed &quot;Birkenhead&quot; soon afterwards after the town where she was built. She had two steam engines from Forrester &amp; Co that drove a pair of paddle wheels, and two masts rigged as a brig.

According to her designer, John Laird: 

The ship was divided into eight watertight compartments, while the engine room was divided by two longitudinal bulkheads into four compartments, making 12 watertight compartments in total. She had a round stern and a bow that ended in a large figurehead of Vulcan, holding a hammer in one hand, and some of &quot;the bolts of Jove&quot; that he had just forged in the other. Her armament was originally intended to be two 96-pounder pivot guns, one forward and the other aft, and four 68-pounder broadside guns.

=== Launch and early life ===
The &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was launched on 30 December 1845 by the Marchioness of Westminster. Her hull then weighed 903 tons and drew , although she was at this time missing approximately 15 tons of cabin fittings. Machinery, stores, and other fittings were expected to add an additional 1,000 or so tons, increasing her draught six more feet. She undertook her maiden voyage to Plymouth in 1846, averaging to for the journey.

She remained laid up for some time, before being put to varied use around England, Scotland and Ireland. In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s iron ship SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer, James Bremner. He was engaged and the &quot;Great Britain&quot; was re-floated on 27 August 1847 with the assistance of HMS &quot;Birkenhead&quot;.

The &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was never commissioned as a frigate, as two factors came into play while she was still under construction that resulted in her being converted into a troopship. Firstly, the Royal Navy&#x27;s warships were switched from paddle wheels to more efficient propeller propulsion, following an experiment by the Admiralty in 1845 in which the benefits of the propeller over the paddle wheel were dramatically demonstrated. Secondly, the Admiralty had doubts about the effects of cannon shot against iron hulls – in a number of trials carried out at the Royal Arsenal in 1845, at lower velocities shot made a jagged hole that was hard to plug.

On 15 September 1847, &quot;Birkenhead&quot; ran down and sank the brig &quot;Oratio&quot; in the English Channel off The Lizard, Cornwall. The owners of the brig sued for their loss in the Admiralty Court. &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was found to be to blame as she had no look-out posted, being nineteen short in her crew.

As part of her conversion to a troopship in 1851, a forecastle and poop deck were added to the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; to increase her accommodation, and a third mast was added, to change her sail plan to a barquentine. Although she never served as a warship, she was faster and more comfortable than any of the wooden sail-driven troopships of the time, making the trip from the Cape in 37 days in October 1850.

==Final voyage (1852)==

In January 1852, under the command of Captain Robert Salmond RN, the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; left Portsmouth conveying troops from ten different regiments, including the 2nd Regiment of Foot and the 74th Regiment of Foot, to the Eighth Xhosa War against the Xhosa in the Cape Colony. On 5 January, she picked up more soldiers at Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, and conveyed some officers&#x27; wives and families.
On 23 February 1852, &quot;Birkenhead&quot; docked briefly at Simon&#x27;s Town, near Cape Town. Most of the women and children disembarked along with a number of sick soldiers. Nine cavalry horses, several bales of hay and 35 tons of coal were loaded for the last leg of the voyage to Algoa Bay.

She sailed from Simon&#x27;s Bay at 18:00 on 25 February 1852 with between 630 and 643 men, women and children aboard, the exact number being in some doubt. In order to make the best possible speed, Captain Salmond decided to hug the South African coast, setting a course that was generally within of the shore. Using her paddle wheels, she maintained a steady speed of . The sea was calm and the night was clear as she left False Bay and headed east.
Shortly before 02:00 on 26 February, while &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was travelling at a speed of , the leadsman made soundings of . Before he could take another sounding, she struck an uncharted rock at with of water beneath her bows and at her stern. The rock lies near Danger Point (near Gansbaai, Western Cape). Barely submerged, this rock is clearly visible in rough seas, but it is not immediately apparent in calmer conditions.

Captain Salmond rushed on deck and ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the collision and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.

=== Sinking ===
The surviving soldiers mustered and awaited their officers&#x27; orders. Salmond ordered the senior military officer, Colonel Seton, to send men to the chain pumps. Sixty were directed to this task, sixty more were assigned to the tackles of the lifeboats, and the rest were assembled on the poop deck in order to raise the forward part of the ship. The women and children were placed in the ship&#x27;s cutter which lay alongside. Two other large boats (capacity 150 each) were manned, but one was immediately swamped and the other could not be launched due to poor maintenance and paint on the winches. This left only three smaller boats available.

The surviving officers and men assembled on deck, where Lieutenant-Colonel Seton of the 74th Foot took charge of all military personnel and stressed the necessity of maintaining order and discipline to his officers. As a survivor later recounted: &quot;Almost everybody kept silent, indeed nothing was heard, but the kicking of the horses and the orders of Salmond, all given in a clear firm voice.&quot;
Ten minutes after the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She instantly broke in two just aft of the mainmast. The funnel went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated for a few minutes before sinking.

Just before she sank, Salmond called out that &quot;all those who can swim jump overboard, and make for the boats&quot;. Colonel Seton, however, recognising that rushing the lifeboats would risk swamping them and endangering the women and children, ordered the men to stand fast, and only three men made the attempt. The cavalry horses were freed and driven into the sea in the hope that they might be able to swim ashore.

The soldiers did not move, even as the ship broke up barely 20 minutes after striking the rock. Some of the soldiers managed to swim the to shore over the next 12 hours, often hanging on to pieces of the wreck to stay afloat, but most drowned, died of exposure or were killed by sharks.

The next morning, the schooner &quot;Lioness&quot; discovered one of the cutters and, after saving the occupants of the second boat, made her way to the scene of the disaster. Arriving in the afternoon, she found 40 survivors still clinging to the rigging. It was reported that, of the approximately 643 people aboard, only 193 were saved. Captain Edward W.C. Wright of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment was the most senior army officer to survive; he was made a brevet major for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.

The number of personnel aboard is in some doubt, but an estimate of 638 was published in &quot;The Times&quot;. It is generally thought that the survivors comprised 113 soldiers (all ranks), 6 Royal Marines, 54 seamen (all ranks), 7 women, 13 children and at least one male civilian, but these numbers cannot be substantiated, as muster rolls and books were lost with the ship.

Of the horses, eight made it safely to land, while the ninth had its leg broken while being pushed into the sea.

===Aftermath===

A number of sailors were court martialled as a result of the accident. The court was held on 8 May 1852 on board HMS &quot;Victory&quot; in Portsmouth, and attracted a great deal of interest. However, as none of the senior naval officers of the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; survived, no one was found to be to blameworthy. Captain Wright told the court martial:

The order and regularity that prevailed on board, from the moment the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.
In 1895, a lighthouse was erected at Danger Point to warn shipping of the dangerous reef. The lighthouse is about tall and is visible for approximately . In 1936, a remembrance plate for the Birkenhead was affixed to its base by the Navy League of South Africa. A new Birkenhead memorial was erected nearby in March 1995. In December 2001, the plaque was moved closer to the lighthouse.

A memorial in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh, bears the following inscription:

Frederick William IV of Prussia was so impressed by the bravery and discipline of the soldiers that he ordered an account of the incident to be read at the head of every regiment in his army. Queen Victoria ordered the erection of an official Birkenhead monument at the Chelsea Royal Hospital. In 1892, Thomas M. M. Hemy painted a widely admired maritime depiction of the incident, &quot;The wreck of the Birkenhead&quot;. Prints of this painting were distributed to the public. In 1977, the South African mint issued a &quot;Heroes of the Birkenhead Medallion&quot; gold coin commemorating the 125 years since the sinking, featuring Hemy&#x27;s painting on one of the faces of the coin.

===&quot;Birkenhead&quot; drill===
The sinking of the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; is one of the earliest maritime disaster evacuations during which the concept of &quot;women and children first&quot; is known to have been applied. &quot;Women and children first&quot; subsequently became standard procedure in relation to the evacuation of sinking ships, in fiction and in life. The term &quot;&quot;Birkenhead&quot; drill&quot; became defined as courageous behaviour in hopeless circumstances and appeared in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1893 tribute to the Royal Marines, &quot;Soldier an&#x27; Sailor Too&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
To take your chance in the thick of a rush, with firing all about,
Is nothing so bad when you&#x27;ve cover to &#x27;and, an&#x27; leave an&#x27; likin&#x27; to shout;
But to stand an&#x27; be still to the Birken&#x27;ead drill is a damn tough bullet to chew,
An&#x27; they done it, the Jollies – &#x27;Er Majesty&#x27;s Jollies – soldier an&#x27; sailor too!
Their work was done when it &#x27;adn&#x27;t begun; they was younger nor me an&#x27; you;
Their choice it was plain between drownin&#x27; in &#x27;eaps an&#x27; bein&#x27; mopped by the screw,
So they stood an&#x27; was still to the Birken&#x27;ead drill, soldier an&#x27; sailor too!
&lt;/poem&gt;

===&quot;Birkenhead&quot; treasure===

There was a rumour that the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was carrying a military payroll of £240,000 in gold coins weighing about three tons, which had been secretly stored in the powder-room before the final voyage. Numerous attempts have been made to salvage the gold. In 1893, the nephew of Colonel Seton wrote that a certain Mr. Bandmann at the Cape obtained permission from the Cape Government to dive the wreck of the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; in search of the treasure. A June 1958 salvage attempt by a renowned Cape Town diver recovered anchors and some brass fittings but no gold. In 1986–1988, a combined archaeological and salvage excavation was carried out by Aqua Exploration, Depth Recovery Unit and Pentow Marine Salvage Company. Only a few gold coins were recovered, which appear to have been the possessions of the passengers and crew.

The rumour of treasure and the shallow depth of the wreck at have resulted in the wreck being considerably disturbed, despite its being a war grave. In 1989, the British and South African governments entered into an agreement over the salvage of the wreck, sharing any gold recovered.
===HMS &quot;Birkenhead&quot; as namesake===
Three placenames in the Canadian province of British Columbia were conferred in honour of the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; disaster by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company explorer Alexander Caulfield Anderson, a boyhood friend and cousin of Lt-Col. Seton of the 74th Regiment of Foot, on a traverse of uncharted country between the Fraser Canyon and the coastal Lower Mainland in 1846. Named after his cousin, Seton Lake cuts west through the Coast Mountains from the Fraser Canyon town of Lillooet, beyond which is its twin Anderson Lake.

A few miles southwest from the head of Anderson Lake is Mount Birkenhead, named by Anderson, on the north side of the low pass connecting the valley of those lakes to that of the Birkenhead River. The river, the valley area near Mount Birkenhead known as Birken, and Birkenhead Lake at the summit of the pass were in turn named after the mountain, and not directly by Anderson.

===Other name legacies===
According to local tradition, Salmonsdam Nature Reserve in the Overberg—a region in South Africa—is named after Captain Robert Salmond. Locals to this day refer to Great White Sharks as &quot;Tommy Sharks,&quot; after the Tommys that were taken by them in water.

<text>The English Renaissance was a cultural and artistic movement in England during the late 15th, 16th and early 17th centuries. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late 14th century. As in most of the rest of Northern Europe, England saw little of these developments until more than a century later within the Northern Renaissance. Renaissance style and ideas were slow to penetrate England, and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance. Many scholars see its beginnings in the early 16th century during the reign of Henry VIII. Others argue the Renaissance was already present in England in the late 15th century.

The English Renaissance is different from the Italian Renaissance in several ways. The dominant art forms of the English Renaissance were literature and music. Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less significant than in the Italian Renaissance. The English period began far later than the Italian, which was moving into Mannerism and the Baroque by the 1550s or earlier.

==Literature==

England had a strong tradition of literature in the English vernacular, which gradually increased as English use of the printing press became common by the mid-16th century. This tradition of literature written in English vernacular largely began with the Protestant Reformation&#x27;s call to let people interpret the Bible for themselves instead of accepting the interpretation of the Catholic Church. Discussions of how to translate the Bible so that it could be understood by laymen but remain faithful to God&#x27;s word became contentious, with people arguing how much license could be taken to impart the correct meaning without sacrificing its eloquence. The desire to let people read the Bible for themselves led William Tyndale to publish his own translation in 1526, giving way to Sir Rowland Hill&#x27;s publication of the Geneva Bible in 1560, marking the re-establishment of the Church of England at the accession of Elizabeth I. These would be predecessors to the King James Version of the Bible.

Another early proponent of literature in the vernacular was Roger Ascham, who was tutor to Princess Elizabeth during her teenage years, and is now often called the &quot;father of English prose.&quot; He proposed that speech was the greatest gift to man from God and to speak or write poorly was an affront. By the time of Elizabethan literature, a vigorous literary culture in both drama and poetry included poets such as Edmund Spenser, whose verse epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; had a strong influence on English literature but was eventually overshadowed by the lyrics of William Shakespeare, Thomas Wyatt and others. Typically, the works of these playwrights and poets circulated in manuscript form for some time before they were published, and above all the plays of English Renaissance theatre were the outstanding legacy of the period. The works of this period are also affected by Henry VIII&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Catholic Church and technological advances in sailing and cartography, which are reflected in the generally nonreligious themes and various shipwreck adventures of Shakespeare.

The English theatre scene, which performed both for the court and nobility in private performances and a very wide public in the theatres, was the most crowded in Europe, with a host of other playwrights as well as the giant figures of Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Elizabeth I herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote occasional poems such as &quot;On Monsieur&#x27;s Departure&quot; at critical moments of her life. Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method. The language of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, first published in 1549, and at the end of the period the Authorised Version (&quot;King James Version&quot; to Americans) of the Bible (1611) had enduring and profound impacts on the English consciousness.

==Visual arts==
England was very slow to produce visual arts in Renaissance styles, and the artists of the Tudor court were mainly imported foreigners until after the end of the Renaissance; Hans Holbein was the outstanding figure. The English Reformation produced a huge programme of iconoclasm that destroyed almost all medieval religious art, and all but ended the skill of painting in England; English art was to be dominated by portrait painting, and then later landscape art, for centuries to come.

The significant English invention was the portrait miniature, which essentially took the techniques of the dying art of the illuminated manuscript and transferred them to small portraits worn in lockets. Though the form was developed in England by foreign artists, mostly Flemish like Lucas Horenbout, the somewhat undistinguished founder of the tradition, by the late 16th century, natives such as Nicolas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver produced the finest work, even as the best producers of larger portraits in oil were still foreigners. The portrait miniature had spread all over Europe by the 18th century. The portraiture of Elizabeth I was carefully controlled and developed into an elaborate and wholly un-realist iconic style, that has succeeded in creating enduring images.

==Music==
English Renaissance music kept in touch with continental developments far more than visual art, and managed to survive the Reformation relatively successfully, though William Byrd (c.1539/40 or 1543 – 1623) and other major figures were Catholic. The Elizabethan madrigal was distinct from, but related to, the Italian tradition. Thomas Tallis ( –1585), Thomas Morley (1557 or 1558 – 1602), and John Dowland (1563–1626) were other leading English composers.

The colossal polychoral productions of the Venetian School had been anticipated in the works of Thomas Tallis, and the Palestrina style from the Roman School had already been absorbed prior to the publication of &quot;Musica transalpina&quot;, in the music of masters such as William Byrd.

The Italian and English Renaissances were similar in sharing a specific musical aesthetic. In the late 16th century Italy was the musical center of Europe, and one of the principal forms which emerged from that singular explosion of musical creativity was the madrigal. In 1588, Nicholas Yonge published in England the &quot;Musica transalpina&quot;—a collection of Italian madrigals that had been Anglicized—an event which began a vogue of madrigal in England which was almost unmatched in the Renaissance in being an instantaneous adoption of an idea, from another country, adapted to local aesthetics. English poetry was exactly at the right stage of development for this transplantation to occur, since forms such as the sonnet were uniquely adapted to setting as madrigals; indeed, the sonnet was already well developed in Italy. Composers such as Thomas Morley, the only contemporary composer to set Shakespeare, and whose work survives, published collections of their own, roughly in the Italian manner but yet with a unique Englishness; interest in the compositions of the English Madrigal School has enjoyed a considerable revival in recent decades.

==Architecture==
Despite some buildings in a partly Renaissance style from the reign of Henry VIII (1491–1547), notably Hampton Court Palace (begun in 1515), the vanished Nonsuch Palace, Sutton Place and Layer Marney Tower, and the building of Soulton Hall under Queen Mary I, it was not until dawning of Elizabethan architecture that a true Renaissance style became widespread, influenced far more by northern Europe than Italy.

The most famous buildings, of a type called the prodigy house, are large show houses constructed for courtiers, and characterised by lavish use of glass, as at &quot;Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall&quot;, Wollaton Hall, Montacute House, Hatfield House and Burghley House, the style continuing into the early 17th century before developing into Jacobean architecture. Lesser, but still large, houses like Little Moreton Hall continued to be constructed and expanded in essentially medieval half-timbered styles until the late 16th century. Church architecture essentially continued in the late medieval Perpendicular Gothic style until the Reformation, and then stopped almost completely, although church monuments, screens and other fittings often had classical styles from about the mid-century. The few new church buildings post-Reformation were usually still Gothic in style, as in Langley Chapel of 1601.

<doc id="952795" wikidata="Q7799478" url="?curid=952795" title="Thus (company)">
<text>Thus was a telecommunications provider operating in the United Kingdom based in Glasgow, Scotland. The company was once listed on the London Stock Exchange and became a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide (CWW). Following the acquisition of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide by Vodafone in July 2012, the company was gradually integrated into Vodafone. This was completed on 1 April 2013.

==History==
The company was founded in 1994 as &quot;Scottish Power Telecommunications Holdings Ltd&quot; (trading as &quot;Scottish Telecom&quot;), an offshoot of the energy company ScottishPower. In 1998 the company acquired Demon Internet. Rod Matthews, who had founded the business, remained as Chief Executive until 1999.

On 4 October 1999 Scottish Telecom announced their new name &quot;thus&quot;.

A short while later in 1999, the newly named Thus PLC listed on the London Stock Exchange.

In 2002 it was demerged from Scottish Power in a deal which effectively wiped out the majority of the company&#x27;s debts, placing the company on a sound financial footing.

In August 2004 it sold its call centre operation to Response Handling Ltd and in 2006 it acquired Your Communications and Legend Communications.

On 28 May 2008 Cable &amp; Wireless plc announced their intention to purchase the company with an offer of 165p per share: this first offer was rejected on 6 June 2008. On 30 June 2008, Cable &amp; Wireless announced that it had acquired a 29.9% stake in Thus and tabled an improved offer of £329 million, or 180p per share. On 1 October 2008, Cable &amp; Wireless completed the takeover of Thus: the company became known as &quot;Thus, a Cable &amp; Wireless business&quot;.

==Operations==
The company supplied some services (most notably Internet services) to small businesses. Many of its major customers had their business transferred to Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide.

==Network==
*National Network built on Nortel Optera LH DWDM Infrastructure.
*160 Wavelength Capable
*10 Gbit/s/wavelength
*Multiple 10Gbs SDH layers based on Nortel Connect DX platform.
*Lower order SDH Layers for VC-12 granularity.

<text>James Michael Christopher Fitzmaurice DFC (6 January 1898 – 26 September 1965) was an Irish aviation pioneer. He was a member of the crew of the &quot;Bremen&quot;, which made the first successful trans-Atlantic aircraft flight from East to West on 12–13 April 1928.

==Early life==
Fitzmaurice was born in Dublin, Ireland on 6 January 1898. His parents were Michael Fitzmaurice and Mary Agnes O&#x27;Riordan. The family resided at 35 Mountjoy Cottages on Dublin&#x27;s North Circular Road.

On 23 May 1902, at the age of four, Fitzmaurice moved with his parents to a house on Dublin Road, Portlaoise, Ireland. Fitzmaurice attended St. Mary&#x27;s, a Christian Brothers School in Maryborough (Portlaoise) until shortly before his 16th birthday.

In 1914 he joined the National Volunteers. Later that year, he enlisted in the Cadet Company of the 7th Battalion of the Leinsters. He was then 16 years of age although the required minimum age was 19. Fitzmaurice was taken out by his father for being underage.

==World War I==
In 1915, Fitzmaurice enlisted in the British Army, 17th Lancers (a cavalry unit). He was sent to France, was wounded, and was twice recommended for a commission. He arrived in France circa May 1916. He was then posted to another English unit, the 7th Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Royal (West Surrey) Regiment of Foot as an acting sergeant. It was part of the 55th Brigade in the British 55th (West Lancashire) Division. In July 1916, he fought in the Battle of the Somme.

On his 19th birthday in January 1917, Fitzmaurice held the rank of Corporal, was an acting Sergeant, and commanded Platoon No. 13 of D Company, 7th Queen&#x27;s. He was approved for a commission in May. On 8 June, Fitzmaurice left for England &quot;to take up commission&quot;. He was sent for training to Cadet College and graduated to the 8th (Irish) Battalion, King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment) as a Second Lieutenant on 28 November 1917. Fitzmaurice was then posted to the School of Military Aeronautics at Reading. On 1 June 1918, Fitzmaurice began his &quot;practical flying training&quot; at Eastbourne Aerodrome. On 28 October 1918, having completed his elementary training at Eastbourne, Fitzmaurice was posted to the No. 1 School of Fighting and Aerial Gunnery at Marske-by-the-Sea, near Middlesbrough. He completed his training as a fighter pilot and was posted to sail to France on 11 November 1918, the day that the Armistice with Germany became effective. His sailing was cancelled when the Armistice was announced.

==After the war==
Fitzmaurice married Violet &quot;Bill&quot; Clarke on his 21st birthday. He continued to serve in the Royal Air Force, flying the mails with 110 Squadron. He served in the &quot;Army of Occupation&quot; until 1919. In May 1919, he was selected to undertake the first-night mail flight (Folkestone to Boulogne). In 1919, he was selected for a Cape to Cairo flight (which did not materialize). From September to November 1919, Fitzmaurice commanded the 6th Wing Working Party of the RAF. He was assigned the task of removing useful material from six aerodromes which had been deactivated. In December he was demobilized and spent most of the following 18 months selling insurance for the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company.

In about May 1921, Patricia Fitzmaurice was born. She was the only child of Violet and James Fitzmaurice. Fitzmaurice was recalled in May 1921 after 18 months and was attached to 25 Squadron. He accepted a Short Service Commission for four to six years. In August 1921 Fitzmaurice resigned his RAF commission.

Sometime during his service in the RAF, Fitzmaurice adopted the accent used by English officers. He apparently retained this distinctively non-Irish accent for the remainder of his life. His new accent may have helped his career in the RAF.

In February 1922, Fitzmaurice joined the Irish National Army&#x27;s Air Service following the formation of the Irish Free State. Early in 1923 he was promoted to captain. On 25 October 1925, he was promoted to Acting Commandant and was appointed second-in-command of the Irish Air Corps, with headquarters in Baldonnel. He was later promoted to Commandant on 1 September 1927.

Fitzmaurice made his first attempt to fly the Atlantic in 1927, when in the &quot;Princess Xenia (aircraft)&quot; (a Fokker F.VIIa aircraft) piloted by Captain Robert Henry McIntosh, who got financial backing from an American millionaire William Bateman Leeds and his co-financier Captain Anthony (Wilfred Heyman) Joynson-Wreford. Captain Joynson-Wreford was to have been the navigator on the flight but unfortunately had to stand down due to the recurrence of an old war injury. Having received the meteorological forecast indicating, that even though the first 200 miles off the Irish coast were poor, the rest of the route to America was clear, so they decided to proceed with the attempt. A large crowd watched their take off from Baldonnel at 1:30 p.m., however, the weather off the coast of Galway was turbulent and got worse until visibility was virtually nil. It seemed suicidal to continue so they turned back and landed at Beale Strand near Ballybunion in County Kerry. Fitzmaurice was co-pilot of the &quot;Xenia&quot; with Maurice W. Piercey for the five and a half-hour flight that only took them 300 miles off the Irish coast.

==&quot;Bremen&quot; flight==
On 12–13 April 1928, Fitzmaurice flew in the crew of the &quot;Bremen&quot; on the first transatlantic aircraft flight from East to West. The crew consisted of:

*Captain Hermann Köhl (1888–1938), pilot
*Commandant James Fitzmaurice, (1898–1965) co-pilot
*Baron Ehrenfried Günther Freiherr von Hünefeld (1892–1929), owner

Köhl made a &quot;perfect three-point landing&quot; on a shallow, ice-covered, water reservoir (which James called a &quot;lagoon&quot;) for the lighthouse at Greenly Island, Canada. Just as the &quot;Bremen&quot; came to a stop, it broke through the ice. The tail then projected about 20 feet (6 m) into the air. Everybody got wet but everybody was safe.

==After the flight==
On 2 May 1928, the 70th United States Congress authorized the President, Calvin Coolidge, to confer the United States Distinguished Flying Cross on the fliers.
In recognition of their trans-Atlantic flight achievement, Fitzmaurice and his two companions were bestowed the Freedom of the City of Dublin on 30 June 1928.

After the successful flight, Fitzmaurice was promoted from Major to Colonel, but he resigned from the Service on 2 February 1929. He was divorced in January 1931. Fitzmaurice met Hitler in 1933, following an invitation extended shortly after the Reichstag elected Hitler as Chancellor, Fitzmaurice was reportedly present to witness the Reichstag fire. 

During much of the 1930s, Fitzmaurice lived in New York. He spent World War II in London, where he ran a club for veteran pilots. After the war, he returned to Ireland.

On 1 June 1955, Fitzmaurice was the guest of honour when Lufthansa inaugurated airline service between Shannon and New York.

Fitzmaurice died in Dublin on 26 September 1965.

==Legacy==

There are streets named for Fitzmaurice in four German cities: Bremen (at the airport), Cologne, Ulm and Pfaffenhofen an der Roth. In addition, streets have been named for him in cities in a number of English-speaking countries, including in Wagga Wagga, Australia.

The Fitzmaurice Flying School was opened in Baldonnel in February 1996 and in April the restaurant in the Kingswood County House Hotel was named after the aviator. In 1998, for the 70th anniversary of the famous flight, a short film was made profiling the life of Fitzmaurice with dramatic reconstruction of the flight. An Post issued a postage stamp commemorating Fitzmaurice as part of a series of four stamps of Irish aviation pioneers in the same year when his daughter, Patricia, unveiled a bronze bust of Fitzmaurice in the foyer of Portlaoise County Hall. Also in 1998, Dublin County Council named the new link road between Saggart and Rathcoole, two villages that are close to the Irish Air Corps headquarters at Baldonnel, as Fitzmaurice Road.

<text>Villalvernia is a comune, population 932, in the Province of Alessandria in Piedmont, Italy, situated in a hilly area on the right bank of the Scrivia.

== History ==
Probably founded during the 10th century, and simply called Villa, the town was partially enfeoffed to the bishops of Tortona by Pope Adrian IV (Nicholas Breakspear). In 1413 Filippo Maria Visconti enfeoffed it to Guglielmo d&#x27;Alvernia. The village remained with the Alvernias for 167 years, which explains the &quot;alvernia&quot; part of the placename.

In 1580, after the wedding of Francesco with Antonia Alvernia, the feud passed to the Spinola family. In 1652 the feudatories obtained the title of Marquess from Philip IV, King of Spain.

On 1 December 1944, the village was bombed by the United States Air Force; 105 inhabitants were killed and 253 were injured.

<text>Christopher Street is a street in the West Village neighborhood of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is the continuation of 9th Street west of Sixth Avenue.

It is most notable for the Stonewall Inn, which is located on Christopher Street near the corner of Seventh Avenue South. As a result of the Stonewall riots in 1969, the street became the center of the world&#x27;s gay rights movement in the late 1970s. To this day, the inn and the street serve as an international symbol of gay pride.

Christopher Street is named after Charles Christopher Amos, the owner of the inherited estate which included the location of the street. Amos is also the namesake of nearby Charles Street, and of the former Amos Street, which is now West 10th Street.

==History==
Christopher Street is, technically, the oldest street in the West Village, as it ran along the south boundary of Admiral Sir Peter Warren&#x27;s estate, which abutted the old Greenwich Road (now Greenwich Avenue) to the east and extended north to the next landing on the North River, at present-day Gansevoort Street. The street was briefly called Skinner Road after Colonel William Skinner, Sir Peter&#x27;s son-in-law. The street received its current name in 1799, when the Warren land was acquired by Warren&#x27;s eventual heir, Charles Christopher Amos. Charles Street remains, but Amos Street is now 10th Street.

The road ran past the churchyard wall of the Church of St. Luke in the Fields (built 1820–22; rebuilt after a fire, 1981–85) still standing on its left, down to the ferry landing, commemorated in the block-long Weehawken Street (laid out in 1829), the shortest street in the West Village. At the Hudson River, with its foundation in the river and extending north to 10th Street, Newgate Prison, the first New York State Prison, occupied the site from 1796 to 1829, when the institution was removed to Sing Sing and the City plotted and sold the land.

West Street is on more recently filled land, but the procession of boats that had made the inaugural pass through the Erie Canal stopped at the ferry dock at the foot of Christopher Street, November 4, 1825, where it was met by a delegation from the city; together they proceeded to the Lower Bay, where the cask of water brought from the Great Lakes was ceremoniously emptied into the salt water.

In 1961, Jane Jacobs, resident in the area and author of &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; published that same year, headed a group that successfully stopped Mayor Robert Wagner&#x27;s plan to demolish twelve blocks along West Street north of Christopher Street, including the north side of Christopher Street to Hudson Street, and an additional two blocks south of it, slated for &quot;urban renewal&quot;.

==Gay icon==

Christopher Street is the site of the Stonewall Inn, the bar whose patrons fought back violently in June 1969 against a police raid, sparking the Stonewall riots that are widely seen as the birth of the gay liberation movement. The Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee formed to commemorate the first anniversary of that event, the beginning of the international tradition of a late-June event to celebrate gay pride. The annual gay pride festivals in Berlin, Cologne, and other German cities are known as Christopher Street Days.

In part because of the riots at the Stonewall Inn, the LGBT community came to congregate around Christopher Street. By the early 1970s, other LGBT businesses had opened along the street, even as the bar itself had closed. A commentator for &quot;The Advocate&quot; wrote in 1972 that the riots had succeeded in associating Christopher Street&#x27;s name with LGBT culture, while a 1982 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article described the street, and particularly the bar&#x27;s site, as the &quot;birthplace of the gay rights movement in this country&quot;. Large numbers of gay men would stroll its length at seemingly all hours. Gay bars and stores selling leather fetish clothing and artistic decorative items flourished at that time. This changed dramatically with the loss of many gay men during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.

&quot;Christopher Street&quot; magazine, a respected gay magazine, began publication in July 1976 and folded in December 1995. Anaïs Nin once worked at Lawrence R. Maxwell Books, located at 45 Christopher Street.

On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on the basis of its status in LGBT history, and on June 24, 2016, the Stonewall National Monument was named the first U.S. National Monument dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement. The visitor center opened on June 28, 2024, as the first official national visitors center dedicated to the LGBTQ+ experience to open anywhere in the world. Numerous politicians and celebrities participated in the inauguration ceremonies, and the New York City Subway&#x27;s Christopher Street–Sheridan Square station was renamed the Christopher Street–Stonewall station on the same day.

===Iconic locations===
Near Sixth Avenue, Christopher Street intersects with a short, winding street, coincidentally named Gay Street.

Since 1992, Christopher Park, located at the intersection of Christopher, Grove, and West 4th Streets, has hosted a duplicate of the sculpture &quot;Gay Liberation Monument&quot; by George Segal to commemorate the gay rights traditions of the area. The Oscar Wilde Bookshop, located on the corner of Christopher and Gay, was the oldest LGBT bookshop in the world until it closed in 2009.

<doc id="952807" wikidata="Q12754542" url="?curid=952807" title="Liberalism in Serbia">
<text>Liberalism in [[Serbia]] is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Introduction==
Liberal parties were active in former Serbia and later in Yugoslavia. After the restoration of democracy liberal factions became active again.

==The timeline==
===From Liberals to Nationalists===
* 1848: Beginning of differentiating of political currents, liberals noticeable next to the conservatives
* 1858: Liberals organized themselves though not yet as political party in the modern sense

<doc id="952812" wikidata="Q7753779" url="?curid=952812" title="The New WKRP in Cincinnati">
<text>The New WKRP in Cincinnati is an American sitcom television series that aired in first-run syndication from September 7, 1991, to May 22, 1993, as a sequel to the original CBS sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–1982). As with the original &quot;WKRP&quot;, MTM Enterprises produced the show.

Gordon Jump (Arthur Carlson), Frank Bonner (Herb Tarlek), and Richard Sanders (Les Nessman) reprised their roles from the original show, while Howard Hesseman reprised the role of Dr. Johnny Fever on a recurring basis (four episodes in the first season, then five in season two). Other original cast members came in for guest spots, with Loni Anderson (Jennifer Marlowe) returning for two episodes and Tim Reid (D.J. Gordon Sims/Venus Flytrap) for one episode. Other recurring players from the original series who appeared as guests on this sequel show included Carol Bruce (Lillian &quot;Mama&quot; Carlson), Edie McClurg (Lucille Tarlek), Allyn Ann McLerie (Carmen Carlson) and Bill Dial (Bucky Dornster).

The week before the show&#x27;s premiere, many stations carrying the program aired the hour-long &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati 50th Anniversary Special&quot;, centered on a newspaper reporter interviewing Arthur Carlson about the fictitious station&#x27;s golden anniversary, which served as a setup to show clips of memorable moments from the original series.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; revisits radio station WKRP, a station that had slowly climbed from near-last in the ratings to a top-10 station over the course of the original series under Program Director Andy Travis (unseen in this series). In the nine years since, another program director, Steve &quot;The Savage&quot; DeMarco (also unseen), had arrived at the station. At the time of the new series&#x27; debut, general manager Arthur Carlson (Gordon Jump), the son of station owner Lillian &quot;Mama&quot; Carlson, had just fired DeMarco after DeMarco&#x27;s reckless on-air antics had embroiled the station in major controversies and jeopardized the station&#x27;s license with the Federal Communications Commission, as the station had fallen back into its previous pattern of malaise after Travis&#x27;s departure.

With the station&#x27;s 50th anniversary approaching, Mr. Carlson hires new program director Donovan Aderhold (Mykelti Williamson) to help restore the station to the success it had a decade prior. While almost all of the staff from the original series has already left in the intervening years, three long-time employees remain: boorish sales manager Herb Tarlek (Frank Bonner), inept news director Les Nessman (Richard Sanders), and unseen overnight jock Moss Steiger, who dies in season 2. Already at the station when Donovan arrives are DJs &quot;the Morning Maniacs&quot; Jack Allen (Michael Des Barres) (who previously appeared in the original series as a different character, the singer of the band &quot;Scum of the Earth&quot;) and Dana Burns (Kathleen Garrett), whose real-life marriage is failing behind the scenes. Donovan soon also hires sexy night-time DJ Mona Loveland (Tawny Kitaen). Off the air, other staff members initially included traffic/continuity co-ordinator Claire Hartline (Hope Alexander-Willis); sporadically seen engineer Buddy Dornster (John Chapell); receptionist Ronnie Lee (Wendy Davis); and, after a few episodes, assistant sales manager Arthur Carlson, Jr. (Lightfield Lewis).

The show underwent many cast changes during its run, eventually dropping or replacing most of the initial &quot;new&quot; cast. Partway through the first season, the characters of Dana Burns and Ronnie Lee were written out. Ronnie&#x27;s replacement as receptionist was spacey blonde Nancy Braithwaite (Marla Rubinoff). Dana&#x27;s character was not replaced.

After the first season, more characters were dropped: Claire Hartline, Jack Allen, and Arthur Carlson, Jr. all disappeared. French Stewart joined the cast in the second season as morning DJ Razor D.

Dr. Johnny Fever (Howard Hesseman) made a few appearances as a guest in season 1; he participated in a four-episode story arc in which he temporarily takes over Steiger&#x27;s overnight shift. Mona Loveland was quietly written out towards the end of season 2 and does not appear in the last five episodes. Donovan Aderhold quit the station in the next-to-last episode and was seemingly killed off in a plane crash at the episode&#x27;s conclusion. Donovan does not appear and is not mentioned in the series finale.

A number of cast members from both old and new series wrote and directed episodes of the series. Howard Hesseman, in addition to appearing in nine episodes, directed two others in which he did not appear. Bill Dial wrote or co-wrote 13 episodes of the series, while Richard Sanders co-wrote three episodes with his wife. Frank Bonner directed five episodes, mostly in season 2, and Mykelti Williamson directed one episode. Non-cast members Asaad Kelada and Max Tash combined to direct most of the show&#x27;s other episodes; among other notable non-cast members in the production staff included Burt Reynolds, Loni Anderson&#x27;s then-husband, who directed one of Jennifer Marlowe&#x27;s two appearances in the series in a stunt casting move, and Los Angeles conservative talk radio personality Doug McIntyre, who wrote two episodes.

As was the case with the aforementioned Andy Travis, Bailey Quarters was completely absent from the series (in her case, her absence is explained; she had left radio many years earlier and was now a successful politician, serving as mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan).

The show ended production in 1993 after two seasons and 47 episodes. Only the &quot;original three&quot; characters of Mr. Carlson, Herb Tarlek, and Les Nessman remain with the program for the entire run and are seen in every episode.

For the first several episodes, the series was still identified as &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; and used a nearly identical opening sequence to the original series, except with updated cast names. &quot;The New&quot; portion was not added to the title until later when clips of the starring actors were added to the title sequence. The familiar opening and closing themes of its parent series were also retained, and while a new arrangement/recording was used for the opening theme, the closing theme was the same version heard on the original series (although a bit faster).

The series followed up on some details left unaddressed in the original series. For example, the actual frequency of WKRP was never revealed in the original series. (Promos for the original series had noted, without specifying a frequency, that the station used the highest available frequency on the AM dial (at the time, before the AM expanded band was opened, this was 1610 AM, used only in the U.S. for noncommercial travelers&#x27; information stations.) In this version, the station is identified as being at 1530 AM, the actual home of WCKY, also licensed to Cincinnati, though the actual 1530 AM is a 50,000-watt class A clear channel frequency, while WKRP&#x27;s coverage map promoted the station as a 5,000-watt Class B station (with the exception of the original series pilot, in which the station was also at 50,000 watts).

Also addressed is why the station is in the same position as the original series, which was supposed to conclude with everyone&#x27;s hard work paying off and the station reaching number six.

===Season 1 (1991–92)===
===Season 2 (1992–93)===
== Critical reception ==
Several critics of the show railed against the thought of continuing the original series, and it premiered to a mix of positive and negative reviews. Among the negative reviews from broadcast professionals was the charge that the station, broadcasting on the AM band, was still playing Rock &#x27;n Roll music in the early 1990s, long after FM was established as the industry&#x27;s leading music band, while most AM stations were adopting talk, all-news and all-sports formats.

As a syndicated program, its time slot differed in various markets. The series was able to operate in the black, but did not produce enough of a profit for investors to back it financially.
