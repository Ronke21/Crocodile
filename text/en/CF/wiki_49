<text>Geometric group theory is an area in mathematics devoted to the study of finitely generated groups via exploring the connections between algebraic properties of such groups and topological and geometric properties of spaces on which these groups can act non-trivially (that is, when the groups in question are realized as geometric symmetries or continuous transformations of some spaces).

Another important idea in geometric group theory is to consider finitely generated groups themselves as geometric objects. This is usually done by studying the Cayley graphs of groups, which, in addition to the graph structure, are endowed with the structure of a metric space, given by the so-called word metric.

Geometric group theory, as a distinct area, is relatively new, and became a clearly identifiable branch of mathematics in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Geometric group theory closely interacts with low-dimensional topology, hyperbolic geometry, algebraic topology, computational group theory and differential geometry. There are also substantial connections with complexity theory, mathematical logic, the study of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups, dynamical systems, probability theory, K-theory, and other areas of mathematics.

In the introduction to his book &quot;Topics in Geometric Group Theory&quot;, Pierre de la Harpe wrote: &quot;One of my personal beliefs is that fascination with symmetries and groups is one way of coping with frustrations of life&#x27;s limitations: we like to recognize symmetries which allow us to recognize more than what we can see. In this sense the study of geometric group theory is a part of culture, and reminds me of several things that Georges de Rham practiced on many occasions, such as teaching mathematics, reciting Mallarmé, or greeting a friend&quot;.

== History ==

Geometric group theory grew out of combinatorial group theory that largely studied properties of discrete groups via analyzing group presentations, which describe groups as quotients of free groups; this field was first systematically studied by Walther von Dyck, student of Felix Klein, in the early 1880s, while an early form is found in the 1856 icosian calculus of William Rowan Hamilton, where he studied the icosahedral symmetry group via the edge graph of the dodecahedron. Currently combinatorial group theory as an area is largely subsumed by geometric group theory. Moreover, the term &quot;geometric group theory&quot; came to often include studying discrete groups using probabilistic, measure-theoretic, arithmetic, analytic and other approaches that lie outside of the traditional combinatorial group theory arsenal.

In the first half of the 20th century, pioneering work of Max Dehn, Jakob Nielsen, Kurt Reidemeister and Otto Schreier, J. H. C. Whitehead, Egbert van Kampen, amongst others, introduced some topological and geometric ideas into the study of discrete groups. Other precursors of geometric group theory include small cancellation theory and Bass–Serre theory. Small cancellation theory was introduced by Martin Grindlinger in the 1960s and further developed by Roger Lyndon and Paul Schupp. It studies van Kampen diagrams, corresponding to finite group presentations, via combinatorial curvature conditions and derives algebraic and algorithmic properties of groups from such analysis. Bass–Serre theory, introduced in the 1977 book of Serre, derives structural algebraic information about groups by studying group actions on simplicial trees.
External precursors of geometric group theory include the study of lattices in Lie groups, especially Mostow&#x27;s rigidity theorem, the study of Kleinian groups, and the progress achieved in low-dimensional topology and hyperbolic geometry in the 1970s and early 1980s, spurred, in particular, by William Thurston&#x27;s Geometrization program.

The emergence of geometric group theory as a distinct area of mathematics is usually traced to the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was spurred by the 1987 monograph of Mikhail Gromov &quot;Hyperbolic groups&quot; that introduced the notion of a hyperbolic group (also known as &quot;word-hyperbolic&quot; or &quot;Gromov-hyperbolic&quot; or &quot;negatively curved&quot; group), which captures the idea of a finitely generated group having large-scale negative curvature, and by his subsequent monograph &quot;Asymptotic Invariants of Infinite Groups&quot;, that outlined Gromov&#x27;s program of understanding discrete groups up to quasi-isometry. The work of Gromov had a transformative effect on the study of discrete groups and the phrase &quot;geometric group theory&quot; started appearing soon afterwards. (see e.g.).

== Modern themes and developments ==
Notable themes and developments in geometric group theory in 1990s and 2000s include:

*Gromov&#x27;s program to study quasi-isometric properties of groups.
:A particularly influential broad theme in the area is Gromov&#x27;s program of classifying finitely generated groups according to their large scale geometry. Formally, this means classifying finitely generated groups with their word metric up to quasi-isometry. This program involves:
:#The study of properties that are invariant under quasi-isometry. Examples of such properties of finitely generated groups include: the growth rate of a finitely generated group; the isoperimetric function or Dehn function of a finitely presented group; the number of ends of a group; hyperbolicity of a group; the homeomorphism type of the Gromov boundary of a hyperbolic group; asymptotic cones of finitely generated groups (see e.g.); amenability of a finitely generated group; being virtually abelian (that is, having an abelian subgroup of finite index); being virtually nilpotent; being virtually free; being finitely presentable; being a finitely presentable group with solvable Word Problem; and others.
:#Theorems which use quasi-isometry invariants to prove algebraic results about groups, for example: Gromov&#x27;s polynomial growth theorem; Stallings&#x27; ends theorem; Mostow rigidity theorem.
:#Quasi-isometric rigidity theorems, in which one classifies algebraically all groups that are quasi-isometric to some given group or metric space. This direction was initiated by the work of Schwartz on quasi-isometric rigidity of rank-one lattices and the work of Benson Farb and Lee Mosher on quasi-isometric rigidity of Baumslag–Solitar groups.
*The theory of word-hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups. A particularly important development here is the work of Zlil Sela in 1990s resulting in the solution of the isomorphism problem for word-hyperbolic groups. The notion of a relatively hyperbolic groups was originally introduced by Gromov in 1987 and refined by Farb and Brian Bowditch, in the 1990s. The study of relatively hyperbolic groups gained prominence in the 2000s.
*Interactions with mathematical logic and the study of the first-order theory of free groups. Particularly important progress occurred on the famous Tarski conjectures, due to the work of Sela as well as of Olga Kharlampovich and Alexei Myasnikov. The study of limit groups and introduction of the language and machinery of non-commutative algebraic geometry gained prominence.
*Interactions with computer science, complexity theory and the theory of formal languages. This theme is exemplified by the development of the theory of automatic groups, a notion that imposes certain geometric and language theoretic conditions on the multiplication operation in a finitely generated group.
*The study of isoperimetric inequalities, Dehn functions and their generalizations for finitely presented group. This includes, in particular, the work of Jean-Camille Birget, Aleksandr Olʹshanskiĭ, Eliyahu Rips and Mark Sapir essentially characterizing the possible Dehn functions of finitely presented groups, as well as results providing explicit constructions of groups with fractional Dehn functions.
*The theory of toral or JSJ-decompositions for 3-manifolds was originally brought into a group theoretic setting by Peter Kropholler. This notion has been developed by many authors for both finitely presented and finitely generated groups.
*Connections with geometric analysis, the study of C*-algebras associated with discrete groups and of the theory of free probability. This theme is represented, in particular, by considerable progress on the Novikov conjecture and the Baum–Connes conjecture and the development and study of related group-theoretic notions such as topological amenability, asymptotic dimension, uniform embeddability into Hilbert spaces, rapid decay property, and so on (see e.g.).
*Interactions with the theory of quasiconformal analysis on metric spaces, particularly in relation to Cannon&#x27;s conjecture about characterization of hyperbolic groups with Gromov boundary homeomorphic to the 2-sphere.
*Finite subdivision rules, also in relation to Cannon&#x27;s conjecture.
*Interactions with topological dynamics in the contexts of studying actions of discrete groups on various compact spaces and group compactifications, particularly convergence group methods
*Development of the theory of group actions on formula_1-trees (particularly the Rips machine), and its applications.
*The study of group actions on CAT(0) spaces and CAT(0) cubical complexes, motivated by ideas from Alexandrov geometry.
*Interactions with low-dimensional topology and hyperbolic geometry, particularly the study of 3-manifold groups (see, e.g.,), mapping class groups of surfaces, braid groups and Kleinian groups.
*Introduction of probabilistic methods to study algebraic properties of &quot;random&quot; group theoretic objects (groups, group elements, subgroups, etc.). A particularly important development here is the work of Gromov who used probabilistic methods to prove the existence of a finitely generated group that is not uniformly embeddable into a Hilbert space. Other notable developments include introduction and study of the notion of generic-case complexity for group-theoretic and other mathematical algorithms and algebraic rigidity results for generic groups.
*The study of automata groups and iterated monodromy groups as groups of automorphisms of infinite rooted trees. In particular, Grigorchuk&#x27;s groups of intermediate growth, and their generalizations, appear in this context.
*The study of measure-theoretic properties of group actions on measure spaces, particularly introduction and development of the notions of measure equivalence and orbit equivalence, as well as measure-theoretic generalizations of Mostow rigidity.
*The study of unitary representations of discrete groups and Kazhdan&#x27;s property (T)
*The study of &quot;Out&quot;(&quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;) (the outer automorphism group of a free group of rank &quot;n&quot;) and of individual automorphisms of free groups. Introduction and the study of Culler-Vogtmann&#x27;s outer space and of the theory of train tracks for free group automorphisms played a particularly prominent role here.
*Development of Bass–Serre theory, particularly various accessibility results and the theory of tree lattices. Generalizations of Bass–Serre theory such as the theory of complexes of groups.
*The study of random walks on groups and related boundary theory, particularly the notion of Poisson boundary (see e.g.). The study of amenability and of groups whose amenability status is still unknown.
*Interactions with finite group theory, particularly progress in the study of subgroup growth.
*Studying subgroups and lattices in linear groups, such as formula_2, and of other Lie groups, via geometric methods (e.g. buildings), algebro-geometric tools (e.g. algebraic groups and representation varieties), analytic methods (e.g. unitary representations on Hilbert spaces) and arithmetic methods.
*Group cohomology, using algebraic and topological methods, particularly involving interaction with algebraic topology and the use of morse-theoretic ideas in the combinatorial context; large-scale, or coarse (see e.g.) homological and cohomological methods.
*Progress on traditional combinatorial group theory topics, such as the Burnside problem, the study of Coxeter groups and Artin groups, and so on (the methods used to study these questions currently are often geometric and topological).

<doc id="955166" wikidata="Q5948092" url="?curid=955166" title="Lemora">
<text>Lemora is a 1973 American horror film written and directed by Richard Blackburn, and starring Cheryl Smith, Hy Pyke, and Lesley Gilb. It follows a young girl in Prohibition-era America who travels to a mysterious town to visit her father, and uncovers a coterie of vampires. It was also released under the alternate titles Lemora: A Child&#x27;s Tale of the Supernatural, The Legendary Curse of Lemora, and Lemora, Lady Dracula.

Conceived by Blackburn, a former University of California, Los Angeles film student, &quot;Lemora&quot; was filmed on location in Pomona and surrounding areas. It had its premiere at Scripps College in April 1973, after which it was sold for distribution to Media Cinema Group, who cut the film by nearly forty minutes and released it theatrically in late 1974. The film was heavily criticized by the Catholic Legion of Decency, which deemed it &quot;anti-Catholic.&quot;

==Plot==
During the Prohibition era in the Southern United States, the devout 13-year-old Lila Lee is summoned by letter to visit her injured father, a gangster, before he dies. She runs away from the Reverend who has raised her and in whose church she has become well known as a singer, though her extraordinary beauty is beginning to attract attention as well. Lila boards a bus to her father&#x27;s purported location, the strange town of Astaroth. At the bus station, the ticket salesman informs Lila that the people there are strange, and that visitors rarely return from the town. That night, the bus Lila is riding, in which she is the only passenger, is attacked by a band of mindless vampires as it approaches the woods surrounding Astaroth. The vampires kill the bus driver, and Lila crashes the bus while attempting to flee. She is attacked by the creatures, but rescued by a mysterious woman named Lemora.

When she regains consciousness, Lila finds herself locked in a cottage outside a farmhouse, where she is tended to by Solange, an elderly hag-like woman who feeds her. Lila attacks Solange and escapes the cottage, fleeing to the farmhouse where she hides in a crawlspace. She hears her father&#x27;s voice from inside the home, but before she can find him, Lila is confronted by Lemora, who informs her she cannot see her father until she is immune to his &quot;disease.&quot; Lila finds that Lemora boards numerous other children in her home, all of whom, like her, are pallid and sickly in appearance.

It becomes evident that Lemora highly covets Lila, bathing her and attempting to soothe her. While alone, Lila is violently attacked by her father, who appears severely mutated. He attacks Solange, killing her, before Lemora chases him away with a torch. Lemora explains that some of the townspeople of Astaroth have become sick, and refers to an impending ceremony in which Lila will participate. After reading a diary of a child in Lemora&#x27;s home, she soon realizes the truth: Lemora is a vampire who feeds upon children and is holding her father captive. She is also the unofficial queen of the Astaroth vampires, and plans to turn Lila into one of her own.

While trying to escape, Lila embarks on a nighttime journey through the town of Astaroth, witnessing the two types of vampires: one faction is like Lemora herself, relatively human in behavior and appearance, while the others are mutated or perhaps regressed, far more feral in behavior and monstrous in form; and the two groups are at war. Meanwhile, the Reverend, who is seeking Lila, manages to retrace her steps.

After a climactic battle which leaves most of the vampires dead, Lila is forced to kill her own father, who has become one of the degenerates. As she weeps over his corpse, Lemora approaches her and offers her comfort by her vampire&#x27;s kiss. When the Reverend shows up not long after, he finds Lila willing, even eager to kiss him. He resists at first, then he gives in. That is when she drives her fangs into his throat and drains his blood, watched over by a smiling Lemora.

In the last scene, Lila is seen singing before her church congregation.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Concept===
&quot;Lemora&quot; was conceived by former University of California, Los Angeles film students Richard Blackburn and Robert Fern. Their main inspiration in making the film was Bob Kelljan&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;Count Yorga, Vampire&quot;.

===Casting===
Smith, seventeen years old at the time of filming, played thirteen-year-old Lila Lee, her first major role. Writer-director Blackburn appears in the film as The Reverend.

===Filming===
Filming took place in and around locations in Pomona, California, including the Phillips Mansion, which was used for the exteriors of Lemora&#x27;s house, and the Bradbury Chateau Estate, where the interiors were shot. Additional photography took place at the San Dimas Hotel. The Reverend&#x27;s house was at Culver Studios, on what was once part of the exterior set for Mayberry on The Andy Griffith Show. Several of Blackburn&#x27;s family and friends had roles in the production.

==Release==
&quot;Lemora&quot; had its premiere in Claremont, California, on April 30, 1973, at the Garrison Theater on the Scripps College campus. The audience response at this screening was allegedly so poor that Fern and Blackburn quickly sought to sell the film and recoup part of the money spent to produce it. Media Cinema Group purchased the movie, cut it from 118 minutes to 80, and distributed it to drive-in theaters and local cinemas in the United States, opening in December 1974.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Lemora&quot; received mostly negative reviews upon its initial release, with some calling it &quot;anti-Catholic&quot;.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film a BOMB, his lowest rating, calling it a &quot;Perfectly awful low budgeter.&quot; Elvis Mitchell from &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Lemora&quot; wants to surpass the expansions on vampire film mythology that propelled the fecund, tightly wound horror movies from Hammer Studios. The film falls far short of its goals, but it is a classic of sorts.&quot;

====Modern assessment====
On the internet film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.1/10.
On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 49 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Barry Meyer from &quot;Film Monthly&quot; called &quot;Lemora&quot; &quot;A real creeper&quot;, writing, &quot;What makes this film work so well is that director-writer Richard Blackburn understands how to shock people with out exploiting the gimmickry of the genre, like so many other films of the era were so willing to do&quot;. In 1992, film writer John Flynn noted &quot;Lemora&quot; as &quot;an artistic offbeat vampire movie which recalled the best of Bava and Bunuel.&quot;

Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, &quot;An art-house vampire movie with lesbian undertones, Richard Blackburn&#x27;s debut film puts an ambitious and surprisingly effective spin on traditional vampire movie cliches.&quot; Dennis Schwartz from &quot;Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews&quot; gave the film a B+, calling it &quot;A haunting and intelligently accomplished work&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD by Synapse Video on August 31, 2004. As of 2020, Synapse Films has declared that they have no plans to release the film on Blu-ray, despite showing a photograph of a 4K scan created five years earlier on social media.

<text>In-Q-Tel (IQT), formerly Peleus and In-Q-It, is an American not-for-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia. It invests in companies to keep the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in information technology in support of United States intelligence capability. The name &quot;In-Q-Tel&quot; is an intentional reference to Q, the fictional inventor who supplies technology to James Bond.
==History==
Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin, and by Gilman Louie, who was In-Q-Tel&#x27;s first CEO. In-Q-Tel&#x27;s mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. According to the Washington Post, In-Q-Tel started as the idea of then CIA director George Tenet. Congress approved funding for In-Q-Tel, which was increased in later years. Origins of the corporation can also be traced to Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences.

Former CIA director George Tenet said,

We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists [cf. the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger], and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results.
In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over US$2.2 million, on November 15, 2005. The shares were a result of Google&#x27;s acquisition of Keyhole, Inc, the CIA-funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth.

In August 2006, In-Q-Tel reviewed more than 5,800 business plans and invested approximately $150M in more than 90 companies.

As of 2016, In-Q-Tel listed 325 investments, but more than 100 were kept secret, according to the Washington Post. The absence of disclosure can be due to national security concerns or simply because a startup company doesn’t want its financial ties to intelligence publicized.

==Governance==
In-Q-Tel is a Virginia-registered corporation, legally independent of the CIA or any other government agency. The corporation is bound by its Charter agreement and annual contract with the CIA, which set out the relationship between the two organizations. In-Q-Tel&#x27;s mission (to support the Intelligence Community&#x27;s technical needs) is promoted by the In-Q-Tel Interface Center (QIC), an office within the CIA that facilitates communication and relationships between In-Q-Tel and government intelligence organizations. While In-Q-Tel is a nonprofit corporation, it differs from IARPA and other models in that its employees and trustees can profit from its investments. A Wall Street Journal investigation found that in 2016, nearly half of In-Q-Tel&#x27;s trustees had a financial connection with a company the corporation had funded. 

In-Q-Tel&#x27;s current president and CEO is Steve Bowsher.

Original members of the board include Lee A. Ault, III, Norman R. Augustine, John Seely Brown, Stephen Friedman, Paul G. Kaminski, Jeong H. Kim, Alex J. Mandl, John N. McMahon, and William J. Perry.

The chairman of the board is Michael M. Crow.

==Investments==

The company lists the majority of its investments on its website page.

In-Q-Tel functions partially in public; however, what products it has and how they are used is strictly secret. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;virtually any U.S. entrepreneur, inventor or research scientist working on ways to analyze data has probably received a phone call from In-Q-Tel or at least been Googled by its staff of technology-watchers.&quot;

<text>Burr Harrison Duval (1809 – March 27, 1836) was the commander of the Kentucky Mustangs, First Regiment Volunteers, a group of Kentucky long-riflemen formed in Bardstown, Kentucky, in November 1835 during the Texas Revolution. He and hundreds of others surrendered to the Mexican army at Goliad, Texas, only to be executed in the Goliad Massacre.

==Early life and family==
Burr H. Duval was the son of William Pope Duval and Nancy Hynes. He was born in 1809 in Bardstown. William Pope Duval was the first and longest-serving (twelve years) Territorial Governor of Florida. Burr Duval&#x27;s brother, John Crittenden Duval (1816–1897), who later became a writer, was captured with him at Goliad; however, his life was spared. Another brother, Thomas Howard DuVal (1813–1880), had a distinguished judicial career in Texas.

He attended St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Bardstown.

==Texas Revolution==
After forming the Kentucky Mustangs, the group traveled to Texas to fight for independence from Mexico. They arrived at Quintana, Texas, in December 1835. Duval and his company were put under the command of Colonel James Walker Fannin, with Duval given the rank of captain.

The Mustangs, along with the five other companies under Fannin&#x27;s command, were in Goliad, Texas, on March 14, 1836, when they received orders from Commander-in-Chief of the Texas Army Sam Houston to retreat to Victoria, Texas. Fannin delayed the retreat from Presidio La Bahia in Goliad, waiting for reinforcements.

Once it was learned that the reinforcements had been defeated on their way to Goliad, Colonel Fannin ordered the retreat. Captain Duval and his men began to retreat with the regiment, however, by the time the order came, the Mexican army under the command of José de Urrea had completely surrounded the town of Goliad. Duval and all of the men under Fannin&#x27;s command were forced to surrender to the Mexican army on March 19, 1836.

A week following the surrender, Antonio López de Santa Anna ordered the execution of most of the captured men. Colonel Fannin, Burr Duval and almost 400 other men were executed on March 27 in what became known as the Goliad Massacre.

==Honors==
Duval County, Texas, is named after him.

<doc id="955232" wikidata="Q7874159" url="?curid=955232" title="USS Simon Lake">
<text>USS &quot;Simon Lake&quot; (AS-33) was the lead ship of her class of submarine tenders in the United States Navy, named for Simon Lake, a pioneering designer of early submarines.

The ship was laid down on 7 January 1963 by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington; launched on 8 February 1964; sponsored by Mrs. Cecil Ford and Mrs. Herbert Diamond; and commissioned on 7 November 1964.

==Service history==

&quot;Simon Lake&quot; sailed from Bremerton on 16 January 1965 for Pearl Harbor on her shakedown cruise and returned to Bremerton on 17 February for a six-week yard availability period. The Polaris submarine tender stood out of Bremerton on 16 April and proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, via the Panama Canal.

&quot;Simon Lake&quot; arrived at Charleston on 1 May and tended submarines there until 11 July 1966. On that date, she sailed for Holy Loch, Scotland, where she relieved as tender for Submarine Squadron 14. She operated from there until 24 May 1970 when she got underway for Charleston. In June, she sailed for Bremerton for her first overhaul since commissioning. The tender was in the yard from 6 July 1970 to March 1971 and, while there, was also converted to Poseidon missile capability.

&quot;Simon Lake&quot; returned to Charleston on 3 April and tended submarines there until 19 November 1972 when she sailed for Rota, Spain, as the relief for .

&quot;Simon Lake&quot; arrived at the Charleston Naval Shipyard in North Charleston, South Carolina, January 1977 for extensive overhaul in one of the three drydocks. Over a year later, the drydock was flooded, the heavy ICBM missile cranes were weight tested, and the ship sent out on a shakedown&quot; cruise.

&quot;Simon Lake&quot; was the first submarine tender to be stationed at Kings Bay Georgia in 1979 when the base first opened and was the first tender on the east coast that women served on in the U.S. Navy. After Refresher Training (REFTRA) in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Simon Lake&quot; assumed duties tending submarines at the Naval Weapons Station, Goose Creek, South Carolina. In June 1979, relieved &quot;Simon Lake&quot; at the Naval Weapons Station Charleston, South Carolina.

From 1979-1985 &quot;Simon Lake&quot; serviced submarines in Kings Bay Georgia, where she also won two Battle Efficiency &#x27;E&#x27; awards. In September 1985 she was driven to Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula Mississippi where she received a stem to stern, inside and out, grind to bare metal and repaint; a replacement of the helo deck; repair of the two 3-inch/50 rear-facing guns; and the addition of a 25 mm Mk38 chain gun weapons system. She was relaunched in September 1986 at which time she did a short shakedown cruise to Guantanamo Bay until December 1986 when she returned to Charleston, South Carolina for a brief stop over to take on supplies before heading off to Holy Loch, Scotland in May 1987.

In May 1987 &quot;Simon Lake&quot; returned to Scotland to again relieve USS &quot;Hunley&quot; at Holy Loch where in 1988 and 1991, she won Battle Efficiency &#x27;E&#x27; awards. She remained on station there until the base was closed and all assets withdrawn in 1992. Sailing for Norfolk, Virginia, that March, &quot;Simon Lake&quot; drew to a close thirty years of US Navy presence in Holy Loch, Scotland.

In March 1992, &quot;Simon Lake&quot; participated in Teamwork &#x27;92, a joint North Atlantic operation and conducted repairs to USS La Moure County (LST-1194) in Trondheim, Norway. Upon departure she crossed the Arctic Circle to perform the Order of the Bluenose for the crew, and stopped for a port call in Halifax, Nova Scotia prior to returning to Norfolk to conduct an extensive overhaul, converting from a ballistic missile submarine tender to an attack submarine tender. After completion of the overhaul and a visit to Palma, Spain in March 1993, she arrived at her new homeport of La Maddalena, Italy where she relieved . For superior service to the fleet, she received the Battle Efficiency &#x27;E&#x27; award, Weapons Black &quot;W&quot; and Meritorious Unit Commendation awards for the period 7 July 1993 - 31 August 1994.

In March 1998, the ship transited the Suez Canal to the United Arab Emirates where she supported Operation Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf. The vessel&#x27;s performance in this period led to her receiving the Navy Unit Commendation and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. In June 1998, she returned to La Maddalena, Italy.

&quot;Simon Lake&quot;″s performance during her last two years of service was particularly noteworthy. Not only did she receive the awards associated with the Persian Gulf but she was nominated for the Secretary of Defense Maintenance Award, received the 1997 and 1998 Battle Efficiency &#x27;E&#x27; awards, the 1998 Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award, and the 1998 Golden Anchor award, and became the first surface ship to receive both the Enlisted Surface Warfare and the Surface Warfare Officer pennants. 
After being relieved by , &quot;Simon Lake&quot; departed La Maddalena on 11 May 1999 and crossed the Atlantic for Norfolk, Virginia to be decommissioned.
&quot;Simon Lake&quot; was decommissioned on 31 July 1999 and, into 2008 was in the mothball fleet in Philadelphia.
&quot;Simon Lake&quot; was placed out of service at Norfolk Naval Shipyards in Portsmouth, Virginia as part of the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility&#x27;s inventory.

&quot;Simon Lake&quot; departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 5 February 2015. Beginning in September 2011, &quot;Simon Lake&quot; underwent the deactivation process in preparation for dismantling. The ship was placed in the James River Reserve Fleet on 3 December 2015 in the care of the U. S. Maritime Administration to await recycling.

<doc id="955251" wikidata="Q241250" url="?curid=955251" title="Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel">
<text>Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (24 October 173910 April 1807), was a German princess and composer. She became the duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach by marriage, and was also regent of the states of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach from 1758 to 1775. She transformed her court and its surrounding into the most influential cultural center of Germany. Her invitation of Abel Seyler&#x27;s theatre company in 1771 marked the start of Weimar Classicism, that would include such figures such as Wieland, Goethe, Herder and Schiller working under her protection.

== Family ==
She was born in Wolfenbüttel, the third child of Karl I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Princess Philippine Charlotte of Prussia. Her maternal grandparents were Frederick William I of Prussia and Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. Her niece was Queen Caroline, wife of King George IV.

== Education ==
Anna Amalia was well-educated as befitted a princess. She studied music with Friedrich Gottlob Fleischer and Ernst Wilhelm Wolf.

== Marriage ==
In Brunswick, on 16 March 1756, sixteen-year-old Anna Amalia married eighteen-year-old Ernst August II Konstantin, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and they had two sons. Ernst August died in 1758 leaving her regent for their infant son, Karl August.

== Regency ==
During Karl August&#x27;s minority she administered the affairs of the duchy with notable prudence, strengthening its resources and improving its position in spite of the troubles of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Despite her heavy official responsibilities, she cultivated intellectual interests, especially music. She continued to take lessons in composition and keyboard playing from the leading musician in Weimar. Amalia von Helvig, a German-Swedish artist and writer, later became part of her court. She hired Christoph Martin Wieland, a poet and translator of William Shakespeare, to educate her son. [2] . On 3 September 1775, her son reached his majority, and she retired.

== Cultural role ==
As a patron of the arts, Anna Amalia drew many of the most eminent people in Germany to Weimar. She gathered a group of scholars, poets and musicians, professional and amateur, for lively discussion and music-making at the Wittum palace. In this ‘court of the muses’, as Wilhelm Bode called it, the members included Johann Gottfried Herder, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller. She succeeded in engaging Abel Seyler&#x27;s theatrical company, considered the best theatre company in Germany at that time.&quot;

Anna Amalia herself played a significant part in bringing together the poetry of &#x27;Weimar Classicism&#x27;. Johann Adam Hiller&#x27;s most successful Singspiel, Die Jagd (the score of which is dedicated to the duchess), received its first performance in Weimar in 1770, and Weimar was also the scene of the notable première on 28 May 1773 of the ‘first German opera’, Wieland&#x27;s Alceste in the setting by Anton Schweitzer. Anna Amalia continued the tradition of the Singspiel in later years with performances in the amateur court theatre of her own compositions to texts by Goethe.

She also established the Duchess Anna Amalia Library, which is now home to some 1,000,000 volumes. The duchess was honored in Goethe&#x27;s work under the title &quot;Zum Andenken der Fürstin Anna-Amalia&quot;.

== Music ==
Anna Amalia was a notable composer. The majority of her works belong stylistically to the &quot;Empfindsamkeit&quot;, in the manner of Hiller and Schweitzer, combining features of song and of arioso. In 2021-2023, further works of Anna Amalia were discovered by the academic Stephen Husarik in the collection of Archduke Rudolf of Austria.
Her compositions include:

=== Chamber ===
*&quot;Divertimento&quot; (clarinet, viola, violoncello, and piano) c. 1780

=== Harpsichord ===
*sonatas

=== Opera ===
*Das Jahrmarktsfest zu Plundersweilern (text by Goethe)
*Erwin und Elmire (text by Goethe) 1776

=== Orchestra ===
*Oratorio (1768)
*&quot;Sacred Choruses&quot; (four voices and orchestra)
*Symphony (2 oboes, 2 flutes, 2 violins and double bass) 1765

=== Vocal ===
*songs

<doc id="955264" wikidata="Q911779" url="?curid=955264" title="Brian Auger">
<text>Brian Albert Gordon Auger (born 18 July 1939) is an English jazz rock and rock music keyboardist who specialises in the Hammond organ.

Auger has worked with Rod Stewart, Tony Williams, Jimi Hendrix, John McLaughlin, Sonny Boy Williamson, Eric Burdon, and CAB. He has incorporated jazz, early British pop, R&amp;B, soul music, and rock into his sound. He has been nominated for a Grammy Award.

==Career==
In 1965, Auger played on &quot;For Your Love&quot; by The Yardbirds as a session musician. He was brought in to play the Hammond organ, but settled for the only available keyboard, the harpsichord. That same year, Auger formed the group The Steampacket with Long John Baldry, Julie Driscoll, Vic Briggs, and Rod Stewart. Due to contractual problems there were no official recordings made by the band; nevertheless, nine tracks were laid down for promotional use in late 1965 and released as an LP in 1970 in France on the BYG label. They were released on a CD by Repertoire Records in 1990 (licensed from Charly Records) as well as 12 live tracks from &quot;Live at the Birmingham Town Hall, February 2, 1964&quot;. Stewart left in early 1966 and soon thereafter the band broke up.
===The Trinity===
With Driscoll and the band Trinity, he went on to record a cover version of David Ackles&#x27; &quot;Road to Cairo&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, which appeared on &quot;Dylan Covered&quot;. The latter track was a number 5 pop hit in the UK. In 1969 Auger, Driscoll, and Trinity performed in the United States on the NBC special &quot;33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee&quot;. Auger and Driscoll stopped performing together after the 1969 album &quot;Streetnoise&quot;, but reunited for the 1978 album &quot;Encore&quot;.
===Brian Auger&#x27;s Oblivion Express===
In 1970, he formed the jazz fusion ensemble Brian Auger&#x27;s Oblivion Express shortly after abandoning the abortive &quot;Wassenaar Arrangement&quot; jazz rock commune in a small suburb of The Hague. Oblivion Express cultivated the talents of several notable musicians, including Average White Band drummers Robbie McIntosh and Steve Ferrone, as well as guitarist Jim Mullen.

According to the 13 December 1970 issue of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, the line up comprised Brian Auger on Keyboards, Jim Mullen on guitar, Barry Dean on bass, and Keith Bailey on drums. Another musician, saxophonist Alan Skidmore was expected to join the group in the near future.

In 1971 Auger produced and appeared on Mogul Thrash&#x27;s only album, &quot;Mogul Thrash&quot;. Two members of that band, Roger Ball and Malcolm Duncan, would go on to form the Average White Band.

===Maestro===
Auger toured with Kim Simmonds, Gregg Errico, and Tim Bogert in the mid-1980s in a band they called Maestro. No album resulted from this collaboration and tour. In 1986, he played keyboards for the Italian singer Mango on the album &quot;Odissea&quot;.
====Further activities====
In 1989, Auger was musical director for the thirteen-part film retrospective series &quot;Villa Fantastica&quot; made for German television. A live recording of the series, &quot;Super Jam&quot; (1990), features Auger on piano, Pete York on drums, Dick Morrissey on tenor saxophone, Roy Williams on trombone, Harvey Weston on bass guitar, and singers Zoot Money and Maria Muldaur.

Auger toured with Eric Burdon in the early 1990s and recorded the live album &quot;Access All Areas&quot; with him in 1993. Oblivion Express was revived in 2005 with recording and touring. The group featured Brian Auger, his son Karma Auger on drums, his daughter Savannah Auger on vocals, and Derek Frank on bass.

In 2012, Auger released &quot;Language of the Heart&quot;, one of the few solo albums of his career, produced by Tea. It features Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter and Julian Coryell on guitars.

In 2014, Auger was invited by producer Gerry Gallagher to record with El Chicano as well as Alphonse Mouzon, David Paich, Alex Ligertwood, Ray Parker Jr., Lenny Castro, Vikki Carr, Pete Escovedo, Peter Michael Escovedo, Salvador Santana, Jessy J, Marcos J. Reyes, Siedah Garrett, Walfredo Reyes Jr., and Spencer Davis. In the same year, Brian Auger and Oblivion Express played at the KJAZZ festival in Los Angeles, and toured in Japan and Europe with Karma Auger on drums, daughter Ali Auger on vocals, Alex Ligertwood on vocals, Yarone Levy on guitar, Les King on bass, and Travis Carlton on bass.

<doc id="955268" wikidata="Q2062793" url="?curid=955268" title="List of heads of government of the Central African Republic">
<text>This article lists the heads of government of the Central African Republic. There have been twenty-five heads of government of the Central African Republic and the Central African Empire. The office of Prime Minister, the head of government, was created when the Central African Republic became an autonomous territory of France in December 1958. It was originally the highest post of the Central African Republic, though France did maintain a governor in the territory. After the Central African Republic declared its independence and became a republic on 13 August 1960, David Dacko held both the Prime Minister and newly created President of the Central African Republic posts briefly before eliminating the Prime Minister position and placing all executive power in the office of the President.

President Jean-Bédel Bokassa restored the office of Prime Minister to assist him in governing the country in 1975, shortly before he declared himself Emperor. He selected as prime minister Elisabeth Domitien, who become Africa&#x27;s first female head of government. After Domitien was removed from office, Bokassa named Ange-Félix Patassé to become his next prime minister. Patassé continued serving as prime minister after Bokassa declared the establishment of the Central African Empire in December 1976. Henri Maïdou succeeded Patassé and continued serving as prime minister after Bokassa was overthrown from power. During the following two years of Dacko&#x27;s presidency, three more politicians served as prime minister. The post was abolished when Dacko was overthrown from the presidency by Andre Kolingba on 1 September 1981. The position, as it exists today, was recreated in 1991, when President Kolingba was forced to relinquish some of the executive power. The President has the authority to name the Prime Minister and can remove them from office at any time. The Prime Minister is the head of the government; within days of being appointed, they must select individuals for their Cabinet, who they will work with to coordinate the government.

According to a ceasefire agreement signed between the government and the Séléka rebel coalition on 11 January 2013, President François Bozizé was required to appoint a new Prime Minister from the political opposition after the National Assembly of the Central African Republic is dissolved and legislative elections are held. According to the agreement, this will happen on 11 January 2014 at the latest. Nicolas Tiangaye, who was selected as prime minister by the opposition and rebels, was appointed as prime minister on 17 January 2013.

The current Prime Minister of the Central African Republic is Félix Moloua, since 7 February 2022.

<doc id="955286" wikidata="Q50711" url="?curid=955286" title="Duchess Anna Amalia Library">
<text>The Duchess Anna Amalia Library () in Weimar, Germany, houses a major collection of German literature and historical documents. In 1991, the tricentennial of its opening to the public, the Ducal Library was renamed for Duchess Anna Amalia. Today, the library is a public research library for literature and art history. The main focus is German literature from the Classical and the late Romantic eras. The ducal library was supplied, among others, by the bookseller Hoffmann from Weimar as well as with publications from France and Europe by the Strasbourg publishing house Bauer, Treuttel and Würtz. The library was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Classical Weimar site because of its testimony to the global cultural importance of Weimar during the late 18th and early 19th centuries during the Weimar Classicism movement.

In 2004 a fire destroyed the main wing and a substantial part of the collection; restoration of salvaged volumes lasted until 2015.

== Contents ==
The library contains over 1,000,000 items, 150,000 of which are available for open use and borrowing. The research library has approximately 850,000 volumes with collection emphasis on the German literature. Among its special collections is an important Shakespeare collection of approximately 10,000 volumes, as well as a 16th-century Bible connected to Martin Luther.

== Building ==
The main building is the Green Castle (), which had been built between 1562 and 1565. The architect was Nikolaus Gromann.

In 2001, construction began on a new multiple-floor facility to house some 1,000,000 books under the &quot;Square of Democracy&quot; () between the Music University and the Red and Yellow Castle. In its pre-renovation state, the building had structural flaws which endangered many valuable books and the special collections.

The new development is estimated to have cost €24 million and has an area of 6,300 m2. The area is divided into upper and lower floors. The new building connects the historical library building with the user areas of the reconstructed Red and Yellow Castle. The grand opening of the new wing took place in February 2005.

Anna Amalia, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, had the building converted into a library in 1761, and in 1766 arranged for the courtly (&quot;hoefische&quot;) book collection to be moved into the library. The Duchess, seeking a tutor for her son Duke Carl August, hired Christoph Martin Wieland, an important poet and noted translator of William Shakespeare. Wieland&#x27;s Shakespeare volumes formed the core of the collection.

From an architectural standpoint, the library is world-famous for its oval Rococo hall featuring a portrait of Grand Duke Carl August.
One of the library&#x27;s most famous patrons was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who worked there from 1797 to 1832. The library also includes the world&#x27;s largest &quot;Faust&quot; collection. The Duchess&#x27;s significant 13,000-volume music collection is also available in the library.

=== Fire of 2004 ===


Part of the collection was burned in a fire on 2 September 2004, which destroyed 50,000 volumes of which 12,500 are considered irreplaceable. Another 62,000 volumes were severely damaged. However, some 6,000 historical works were saved, including the 1534 Luther Bible and a collection of Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s papers, by being passed from hand to hand out of the building. Some 28,000 books in the building were rescued and so not affected by the fire. Other items, like Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s death mask, suffered damage too, and 35 historic oil paintings were destroyed.

The fire came as a particular tragedy, in part because the collection was scheduled to move to another site in late October, little more than a month later. Some of the damaged books are being freeze-dried in Leipzig to save them from rotting as a result of water damage. Book restoration was scheduled to last at least until 2015.

In June 2005, it was announced that among the manuscripts that were out of the building at the time of the fire, and thus saved from damage, there was a hitherto undiscovered 1713 aria by Johann Sebastian Bach entitled &quot;Alles mit Gott und nichts ohn&#x27; ihn&quot;.

The library building was restored for $18.2 million and reopened at the end of October 2007 with some 60,000 volumes. This includes the undamaged books, the first restored books and the replacement volumes obtained on the international antique book market, from other libraries, or by donation. An online database lists the books the library is still seeking in order to replace volumes it lost.

<text>Biopunk (a portmanteau of &quot;biotechnology&quot; or &quot;biology&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;) is a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on biotechnology. It is derived from cyberpunk, but focuses on the implications of biotechnology rather than mechanical cyberware and information technology. Biopunk is concerned with synthetic biology. It is derived from cyberpunk and involve bio-hackers, biotech megacorporations, and oppressive government agencies that manipulate human DNA. Most often keeping with the dark atmosphere of cyberpunk, biopunk generally examines the dark side of genetic engineering and depicts the potential perils of biotechnology.

==Description==
Biopunk is a subgenre of science fiction closely related to cyberpunk that focuses on the near-future (most often unintended) consequences of the biotechnology revolution following the invention of recombinant DNA. Biopunk stories explore the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of human experimentation, against a typically dystopian backdrop of totalitarian governments and megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as means of social control and profiteering. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on information technology, but on synthetic biology. Like in postcyberpunk fiction, individuals are usually modified and enhanced not with cyberware, but by genetic manipulation. A common feature of biopunk fiction is the &quot;black clinic&quot;, which is a laboratory, clinic, or hospital that performs illegal, unregulated, or ethically dubious biological modification and genetic engineering procedures. Many features of biopunk fiction have their roots in William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, one of the first cyberpunk novels.

One of the prominent writers in this field is Paul Di Filippo, though he called his collection of such stories ribofunk, a blend of &quot;ribosome&quot; and &quot;funk&quot;. Di Filippo suggests that precursors of biopunk fiction include H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;; Julian Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Tissue-Culture King&quot;; some of David H. Keller&#x27;s stories, Damon Knight&#x27;s &quot;Natural State and Other Stories&quot;; Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth&#x27;s &quot;Gravy Planet&quot;; novels of T. J. Bass and John Varley; Greg Bear&#x27;s &quot;Blood Music&quot; and Bruce Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Schismatrix&quot;. The stories of Cordwainer Smith, including his first and most famous &quot;Scanners Live in Vain&quot;, also foreshadow biopunk themes. Another example is the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series published from 1999 to 2003, which prominently feature the Yuuzhan Vong who exclusively use biotechnology.

<doc id="955303" wikidata="Q3432134" url="?curid=955303" title="Rimshot">
<text>A rimshot is a percussion technique used to produce an accented snare drum backbeat. The sound is produced by simultaneously hitting the rim and head of the drum with a drum stick.

==The sound and various techniques==
The sound of rimshots can be described as &quot;part normal snare and part loud, woody accent&quot;, or &quot;generally sharper, brighter and more cutting [than a standard accent]&quot;, since the technique produces large amounts of overtones.

The stroke is used on the snare in rock, pop, Jazz, and blues and on the tom-toms in Afro-Cuban music. The technique is also common in bossa nova, ska, reggae, and rocksteady.

In marching percussion, there are three types of rimshots:
*The most common is the &quot;normal&quot; rimshot, which is played with the tip (bead) of the stick held about three inches (about 8 cm) from the rim. This produces a prominent, accented tone. 
*The second is the &quot;ping shot&quot;, where the bead is struck about one inch (2.5 cm) from the rim. This produces a high-pitched sound. 
*The third is a &quot;gock&quot; (also spelled &quot;gawk&quot;), which is produced by hitting the bead of the drum stick at the center of the drum while the rim is percussed with the distal shaft of the stick (near the hand). This makes a lower sound.

In Latin percussion, timbales players use rimshots near the edge of the head, but these sound very different from in marching percussion.

In orchestral percussion, a rimshot is performed by placing one drum stick with the stick head near the middle of the drumhead, and the shaft pressed against the rim, and striking with the other stick. This produces a less powerful sound, and is easier to execute than a typical rimshot. This variation is also known as a &quot;stick shot&quot;.

The rimshot is often confused with the cross stick technique, in which the tip of a drum stick is placed on the head near one of the bearing edges and the shaft of the stick is struck against the rim opposite the tip, thus creating a dry, high-pitched &quot;click&quot; similar to a set of claves. As a result, the stroke is frequently used in bossa nova to imitate the sound of claves; it is also used for ballads in rock, pop, and country music.

==More general use of the term==
The musical phrase played on percussion instruments used to punctuate jokes is known in percussion jargon as a sting. This is often called a &quot;rimshot&quot;, although some versions of it do not include a rimshot in the technical sense.
A rimshot when used to accent the punchline of a joke being told by a live comedian may or may not simultaneously be played with a small cymbal crash. Sometimes, the comedian would react to the rimshot as if they did not expect it and in doing so, pass the reaction and responsibility for the rimshot on to the drummer, when in fact, the comedian had previously instructed the drummer when to use and when not to use the rimshot. Despite having previously been scripted into the routine by the comedian, these were designed to appear to be improvised by the drummer, so as to accentuate the joke.

<doc id="955305" wikidata="Q1799885" url="?curid=955305" title="Lade (crater)">
<text>Lade is the remains of a lunar impact crater that has been flooded by lava. Its diameter is 58 km. It was named after German astronomer Heinrich Eduard von Lade. To the north is the crater Godin and to the south-southwest is the worn, lava-flooded Saunder.

The southern rim of Lade has been completely covered or destroyed, and there are gaps in the relatively thin southeast rim. The surviving crater wall is worn and somewhat hexagonal in outline. There is a smaller bowl-shaped crater attached to the interior of the western rim. To the north the crater designated Lade B has been completely filled with lava.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lade.

<text>Lamont is a system of low ridges in the surface of Mare Tranquillitatis that is most likely a submerged impact crater. It was named after Scottish-born German astronomer Johann von Lamont. It is located to the southeast of the crater Arago.

Lamont has the shape of two roughly concentric but incomplete rings with an inner diameter of 60 km and an outer diameter of 120 km. (The official diameter is 75 km.) Radial ridges radiate away from the center of Lamont, except in the east and west quadrants. The ridge system is only a few hundred meters in height, with a width that averages 5 km but is thicker to the southeast. This feature is only readily visible at low angles of illumination, when shadows highlight the terrain features.

This feature is associated with a mass concentration (mascon), a sub-surface region of higher-density material.

<text>Lick is a lunar impact crater that has been flooded with basaltic lava. This crater was named in memory of James Lick, a Californian philanthropist. The north rim is attached to the smaller, bowl-shaped crater Greaves. Lick lies on the southwest edge of Mare Crisium. Its rim is broken at the north and south ends, and the southwest rim is attached to the crater remnant Lick A. There is a small, flooded crater within the southern part of Lick&#x27;s inner floor, and several tiny craters mark the interior surface. A small, unnamed crater at the east rim has a bright ray system.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lick.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Lick D — &quot;See&quot; Greaves.

<doc id="955329" wikidata="Q247023" url="?curid=955329" title="Robert Lansing (actor)">
<text>Robert Lansing (; born Robert Howell Brown, June 5, 1928 – October 23, 1994) was an American stage, film, and television actor.

Lansing is probably best remembered as the authoritarian Brigadier General Frank Savage in &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1964), the television drama series about American bomber pilots during World War II. During his career, which spanned five decades, Lansing appeared in 245 episodes of 73 television series, 11 TV movies, and 19 motion pictures. His other notable television roles included &quot;87th Precinct&quot; (1961–62), &quot;Automan&quot; (1983–1984), and &quot;The Equalizer&quot; (1985–1989).

==Early life==
While living in Los Angeles, California, he attended University High School. As a young actor in New York City, he was hired to join a stock company in Michigan, but was told he would first have to join the Actors&#x27; Equity Association. Equity would not allow him to join as &quot;Robert Brown&quot; because another actor was using that name. Because the stock company was based in Lansing, this became the actor&#x27;s new surname.

Lansing served two years in the U.S. Army and was stationed in Osaka, Japan, where he worked at Armed Forces Radio.

==Career==
===Early roles===
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, he worked under his real name Bob Brown as a radio announcer at WANE in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He also was active as an actor in a Fort Wayne theater group. Lansing first appeared on Broadway in the play &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1951) directed by José Ferrer, replacing Mark Roberts in the role of Dunbar at the 48th Street Theater. He gained early acting experience at the Actors Studio.

=== Stage ===
His rugged good looks, commanding stage presence, and stentorian voice earned him continuing stage work and throughout his film career, he periodically returned to the New York stage, making his last such appearance in 1991.

He played the lead in the 1973 Roundabout Theater production of August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Father&quot;, staged by Gene Feist. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Clive Barnes praised Lansing&#x27;s &quot;mannered, tortured, and racked portrait of the Captain&quot; as &quot;superlative,&quot; comparing it favorably with a Michael Redgrave performance years earlier. Also that year he starred with Barbara Bel Geddes in the Broadway production of Jean Kerr&#x27;s comedy &quot;Finishing Touches&quot;. In 1977, Lansing appeared in a one-man show as coal miner union leader John L. Lewis.

Lansing appeared in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; and Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Great God Brown&quot; in the title role. His other stage performances included roles in &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;, Elmer Rice&#x27;s &quot;Cue for Passion&quot;, &quot;The Lovers&quot;, and &quot;The Cut of the Axe&quot;. Off-Broadway, his work included &quot;The Father&quot;, the &quot;Sea Plays&quot; of Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and two one-man shows, &quot;Damien&quot; and &quot;The Disciple of Discontent&quot;.

In 1989, Lansing appeared at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in a dramatization of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;. The three-person cast also included Christopher Reeve and Laurie Kennedy.

===Film===
On film, Lansing starred in the 1959 science-fiction film &quot;4D Man&quot;. He also starred as marine biologist Hank Donner in the 1966 nature drama film &quot;Namu, the Killer Whale&quot;. His other films included &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot;, &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot;, &quot;The Grissom Gang&quot;, &quot;Bittersweet Love&quot;, &quot;False Face&quot;, &quot;Empire of the Ants&quot;, and &quot;The Nest&quot;.

===Television===
Lansing first appeared on TV on &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; in 1956. In the 1961–1962 television season, Lansing was cast as Detective Steve Carella on NBC&#x27;s &quot;87th Precinct&quot; series, based on the Ed McBain detective novels. His costars were Gena Rowlands, Ron Harper, Gregory Walcott, and Norman Fell. Also in 1961, he played Jed Trask, a troubled shooter, in the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode, &quot;Cutthroat Junction&quot;. He guest-starred in two other episodes of the NBC&#x27;s Western series: &quot;Danger Road&quot; (1970) as Gunny O&#x27;Riley and &quot;Heritage of Anger&quot; (1972) as John Dundee. He played Doc Holliday in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tall Man&quot;, with Barry Sullivan and Clu Gulager. Lansing starred alongside Clu Gulager again in a 1965 episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian&quot; TV series titled &quot;The Brothers&quot;. Again on NBC, in 1966, Lansing guest-starred as General Custer in a three-episode segment of &quot;Branded&quot; called &quot;Call to Glory&quot;.
Robert Lansing is probably best known for his role as Brigadier General Frank Savage in the first season of the Quinn Martin production, &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, which aired on the ABC Television Network from 1964 to 1967.

His other television roles include portrayals of an alcoholic college professor in ABC&#x27;s drama &quot;Channing&quot;, as Gil Green in the 1963 episode &quot;Fear Begins at Forty&quot; on the NBC medical drama &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, as a bounty hunter on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and as a parole officer in a 1968 episode (&quot;A Time to Love — A Time to Cry&quot;) of &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;.

He was the interstellar secret agent Gary Seven in a &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode (&quot;&quot;, 1968), which also featured Teri Garr, and was originally intended as a backdoor pilot for an unsold new series.

Lansing played an international secret agent in &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;, and Lt. Jack Curtis on &quot;Automan&quot;. He also played a recurring role, known only as &quot;Control&quot;, on 29 episodes of &quot;The Equalizer&quot; between 1985 and 1989, which then was spun-off into the TV movie &quot;Memories of Manon&quot;, which aired on February 13, 1989. He guest-starred in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Long Morrow&quot; and in the &quot;Thriller&quot; episode &quot;Fatal Impulse&quot;. He also guest-starred on other television productions such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

In the 1980s, he did a series of television commercials for Liberty National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, and for the popular supermarket chain Giant Eagle.

Lansing&#x27;s final television role was that of Police Captain Paul Blaisdell on the series &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;. The role was written specifically for Lansing by series writer and executive producer Michael Sloan, who had worked with Lansing on the series &quot;The Equalizer&quot; in the 1980s, although Lansing had already been diagnosed with cancer. Despite continuing health problems, Lansing performed in 24 episodes in the first and second seasons. In the final episode of season two, titled &quot;Retribution&quot;, Lansing&#x27;s character of Blaisdell was written out, with the possibility of the character returning if the actor&#x27;s health improved. The episode, filmed in February 1994, was Lansing&#x27;s final acting performance. It aired on November 28, 1994, a month after the actor died, and was dedicated to his memory.

==Personal life==
Lansing had a son, Robert Frederick Orin Lansing, with his first wife, actress Emily McLaughlin whom he married in 1956; they divorced in 1968. The following year, Lansing married Gari Hardy, but this marriage also ended in divorce. The couple had a daughter, Alice Lucille Lansing. His last marriage was to Anne Pivar, with whom he remained until his death in 1994. From 1991 to 1993, he was president of The Players Club, a theatrical fraternal organization founded by Edwin Booth in 1888.

A long-time smoker, Lansing died in a Bronx, New York, hospice while undergoing treatment for lung cancer. He was 66.

His funeral was at Congregation Rodelph Shalom in Manhattan, after which he was buried at Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens.

<text>The Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment was a specialist expeditionary unit of the British armed forces. Personnel of the Joint CBRN Regiment were trained in the detection, identification and monitoring of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

In 1994, the Royal Yeomanry, a regiment of the Territorial Army, was re-designated from its reconnaissance role to operate as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first dedicated nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) defence unit. Following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the NBC role was transferred to a newly formed joint regiment consisting of units from both the British Army and Royal Air Force. Formed on 1 April 1999 as the Joint NBC Regiment, from a stated recommendation in the Strategic Defence Review for an operational unit to support deployed forces of the British military in NBC defence and assistance. In 2005, the name of the regiment was changed following the addition of radiological weapons to its remit, and the NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) designation changed to CBRN.

There were five regular squadrons; four from the 1st Royal Tank Regiment and one (No. 27 Squadron) from the RAF Regiment. Two squadrons (A and W) from the Royal Yeomanry and, from March 2004, 2623 Squadron RAF Regiment provided a reserve capability.

On 21 July 2005, the name of the unit was changed from the Joint Nuclear Biological and Chemical Regiment (JNBCR) to the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment (JCBRNR).

Elements of the Joint CBRN Regiment have since operated in this role in Kuwait and Iraq (on Operation Telic, in which the Royal Yeomanry squadrons combined into a single unit named Y Squadron) and Afghanistan. The regiment contributed to operations world-wide during every year of its formation.

It was disbanded on 16 Dec 2011 as a result of the 2010 UK Strategic Defence and Security Review, with capabilities being transferred into the newly formed Defence CBRN Wing, formed by 26 and 27 Sqns RAF Regiment and 2623 Sqn RAuxAF Regiment. The FUCHS armoured vehicle was retired at this point.

The 1st Royal Tank Regiment then became divisional troops within 3rd Mechanised Division. Nevertheless, in 2014, the Royal Tank Regiment formed up with one squadron, Falcon Squadron, dedicated towards CBRN, and brought the FUCHS vehicles back into service in 2016.

<text>Lippershey is a relatively tiny lunar impact crater located in the southeast section of the Mare Nubium. It was named after German-Dutch optician Hans Lippershey. It is a circular, cup-shaped feature surrounded by the lunar mare. Lippershey lies to the northeast of the crater Pitatus.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is the closest to Lippershey.

<text>The Sauveterrian is the name for an archaeological culture of the European Mesolithic which flourished around 8500 to 6500 years BP. The name is derived from the type site of Sauveterre-la-Lémance in the French of Lot-et-Garonne.

It extended through large parts of western and central Europe. Characteristic artefacts include geometric microliths and backed points on micro-blades. Woodworking tools are notably missing from Sauveterrian assemblages. There is evidence for ritual burial.

<text>Marth is a small lunar impact crater located in the northwest part of the Palus Epidemiarum. It was named after German astronomer Albert Marth. To the northwest is the crater Dunthorne, and to the southwest lies Ramsden. This feature lies in a system of rilles named the Rimae Ramsden, and an interrupted branch passes only a few kilometers to the south of the rim.
Marth is unusual for having a double rim, with a smaller inner crater concentric to the outer rim. The smaller crater is located near the center of the larger rim, giving the feature a bullseye appearance.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Marth.

<text>The Tardenoisian (or Beuronian) is an archaeological culture of the Mesolithic/Epipaleolithic period from northern France and Belgium. Similar cultures are known further east in central Europe, parts of Britain. and west across Spain. It is named after the type site at Fère-en-Tardenois in the Tardenois region in France, where E. Taté first discovered its characteristic artifacts in 1885.

Characteristic artifacts differ from earlier industries by the presence of geometric microliths, microburin, scalene triangles, trapezoids and chisel-ended arrowheads and small flint blades made by the pressure-technique. The term is also used for several microlithic industries and sites in northern Italy and Eastern Europe and to distinguish the northern French Tardenoisian sites from the Sauveterrian industry in southern France.

The Tardenoisian followed the Ahrensburgian, with which it was paralleled, and lasted from about 9000 BC until 4000 BC (in Britain) in the Neolithic.

<text>Murchison is a lunar impact crater on the north edge of the Sinus Medii. It was named in honour of the geologist Sir Roderick Murchison. It shares a section of rim with the crater Pallas. To the southeast on the mare is the circular crater Chladni, and to the northeast is Ukert. Farther to the east is the prominent Triesnecker. Murchison lies astride the lunar zenith line, i.e. the starting longitude of the selenographic coordinate system.

The wall of Murchison is heavily worn and has completely disappeared in a wide gap to the southeast. The rim is most intact along the northeast part of the crater, but even there it is indented and irregular. Only a ridge remains of the rim shared by Pallas and Murchison, with gaps to the north and south. A low ridge from the east wall runs south to join the rim of Chladni. The crater floor has been flooded with lava and joins the Sinus Medii through the wide gap in the southeast wall.

==Satellite craters==

By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Murchison.

<doc id="955377" wikidata="Q2748049" url="?curid=955377" title="Churchill Downs">
<text>Churchill Downs is a horse racing complex located on Central Avenue in south Louisville, Kentucky, United States, famed for hosting the annual Kentucky Derby. It officially opened in 1875 and was named for Samuel Churchill, whose family was prominent in Kentucky for many years. The first Kentucky Derby, a Thoroughbred sweepstakes and part of today&#x27;s horse racing Triple Crown, and the first Kentucky Oaks were held in the same year. Churchill Downs has also hosted the renowned Breeders&#x27; Cup on nine occasions, most recently on November 2 and 3, 2018. 

The racetrack is owned and operated by Churchill Downs Incorporated. With the infield open for the Kentucky Derby, the capacity of Churchill Downs is roughly 170,000. 

In 2009 the Horseplayers Association of North America introduced a rating system for 65 Thoroughbred racetracks in North America, which ranked Churchill Downs number 5 on its list.

In 2014, prior to the start of their spring meet, Churchill Downs announced an increase in parimutuel takeout rates. As a result of the takeout increase, Churchill Downs ranked number 22 in that year&#x27;s Horseplayers Association of North America Track Ratings.

==History==
The track is named for John and Henry Churchill, who leased of land to their nephew, Colonel Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. (grandson of explorer William Clark). Clark was president of the Louisville Jockey Club and Driving Park Association, which formed in 1875. His father-in-law, Richard Ten Broeck, was an accomplished horse breeder and trainer, and introduced Clark to horse racing, attending the English Derby at Epsom Downs outside London. 

Churchill Downs filled a void in Louisville left by the closing of Oakland and Woodlawn, two earlier race courses. The then-rural location was along Louisville and Nashville Railroad tracks, allowing for easy transport of horses. Clark, who preferred longer races to the relatively short ones that had become popular by the 1890s, was running short of funds, and in 1894 sold the track to a syndicate led by William E. Applegate. The new ownership would soon institute many changes, such as commissioning the famous twin spire grandstand in 1895, shortening the length of the signature race to its modern in 1896, and adorning the winner of the Derby with a garland of roses, a tradition that also began in 1896.

In early 1902, Applegate, who had made his fortune as a bookmaker, turned over the day-to-day operation of the track to Charles F. Grainger, then the mayor of Louisville, in an effort to move Churchill Downs away from being primarily known for gambling. Among the new people Applegate brought on board to help him run the track was Col. Matt Winn of Louisville. Churchill Downs prospered and the Kentucky Derby then became the preeminent stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses in North America.

During that early period, a new clubhouse was built in order to promote social interaction and new events such as steeplechases, automobile races and band concerts. The State Fair was held on the grounds, featuring the odd spectacle of two locomotives being intentionally crashed head-on in the infield.

On June 5, 1907, African American jockey James Lee set a record that has never been beaten when he won the entire six-race card at Churchill Downs.

In 1908, parimutuel betting machines were introduced as gambling began to be less controversial again, and the wagering portion of the track&#x27;s business became more profitable.

Churchill Downs was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

On Friday, June 19, 2009, Churchill Downs hosted its first-ever night race with an attendance of over 27,000.

Churchill Downs ventured into the music business, organizing the inaugural HullabaLOU Music Festival, held on the weekend of July 23–25, 2010. The track had planned to make this an annual event to compete with other summer music festivals. HullabaLOU attracted 78,000 people but that fell short of the more than 100,000 expected by the company. The company attributed this to the brutal heat, but others cited high ticket prices in a poor economy. The entertainment division lost more than $5 million in its first year and was discontinued.

On Wednesday, June 22, 2011, an EF2 tornado hit the Louisville area, striking the stables and chapel at Churchill Downs, at EF1 intensity. Several stables were badly damaged, as was the chapel. Over 200 horses had to be evacuated from the damaged stables and be relocated to other stables that were not damaged by the tornado. The tornado did not cause any damage to the twin spires or the clubhouse.

&quot;Thurby&quot; is a portmanteau for &quot;Thursday&quot; plus &quot;Derby&quot;, and this name for the Thursday racing in Derby week has been recognized by Churchill Downs since 2014.

In June 2023, following the investigation by Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority over twelve horse fatalities since April 27, 2023, Churchill Downs transferred its spring-summer racing meet to Ellis Park Race Course in Henderson, Kentucky while it re-evaluated its safety measures.

==Facilities==
The twin spires atop the grandstands are the most recognizable architectural feature of Churchill Downs and are used as a symbol of the track and the Derby. They were designed by the renowned Louisville architectural firm D.X. Murphy &amp; Bro. who were prolific in the city, markedly so for their philanthropic work with the Catholic Church. Today, Churchill Downs covers . The usual number of people seated at the derby is 50,000 people, though crowds can reach over 150,000 on Derby day. The dirt oval main track, on which the Derby is run, is one mile (1.6 km) in circumference and is wide, with a section for the starting gate. A turf track, inside the main track, is in circumference and wide.

From 2001 to 2005, Churchill Downs underwent a three-and-a-half year, $121 million renovation. The clubhouse was replaced, 79 luxury suites were added, and the historic twin spires were refurbished. One of the additions in the clubhouse was a mural by Pierre Bellocq depicting all 96 jockeys to win the Kentucky Derby from 1875 to 2004. In summer 2008 the same artist added another mural depicting all of the trainers and updating the Jockey&#x27;s painting, adding Calvin Borel and Edgar Prado to it. These updates are done yearly to accommodate new winning trainers and jockeys. The new design has been somewhat controversial since the new suites block full view of the spires from most angles.
Racing at Churchill Downs occurs in three meets though for the majority of its existence there were only two meets per year. The spring meet starts one week before the Derby and continues until early July. The Kentucky Derby is held the first Saturday in May and the Kentucky Oaks is run on the Friday before the Derby. A fall meet picks up in late October and closes Thanksgiving weekend in late November. Night races were established in 2009. A third meet in September was added in 2013.

In addition to the track, clubhouse and stables, Churchill Downs also contains the Kentucky Derby Museum which focuses on the history of the Kentucky Derby and Churchill Downs. The museum also contains a number of exhibits exploring the training and racing of thoroughbred horses. It includes a 360-degree cinema that shows the short film &quot;The Greatest Race&quot;, a documentary about the Kentucky Derby. The museum is normally open year-round.

In October 2013, Churchill Downs began installing a new, ultra high-definition video board built by Panasonic, which became operational in time for the 2014 Kentucky Derby. Called &quot;The Big Board&quot;, it measures wide and high, with the bottom edge off the ground, and weighs . It was constructed along the outside of the backstretch of the dirt course facing the grandstand and infield. At the time, it was the largest ultra high-definition video board ever constructed. At the same time, 750 speakers were installed around the track.

Churchill Downs has had several renovation projects since the early 2010s. A new grandstand on the clubhouse turn, the First Turn Club, was completed and opened before the 2023 Kentucky Derby with capacity for more than 7,000 people. The following year, before the 150th Kentucky Derby, a new $200 million paddock was opened. In February 2025 track management announced two new projects. A reconstructed grandstand between the finish line and the First Turn Club with capacity for over 13,000 people is expected to open in 2027 and be fully operational the following year. New permanent structures on the infield facing the homestretch are expected to open in stages between 2026 and 2028.

<text>Oersted is a lunar impact crater that has been flooded by lava, leaving only a crescent-shaped rim with a gap to the southwest. The rim climbs to a maximum height of 1.7 km. This feature lies to the southeast of the crater Atlas, and southwest of Chevallier. To the south-southwest is Cepheus.

The northern rim of Oersted is overlain by a broken, lava-flooded craterlet. Just to the south is a younger, still-intact crater named Oersted A that was formed after Oersted was flooded. To the northwest, the flooded crater Oersted P is attached to the northwest arm of the outer rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Oersted.

<doc id="955389" wikidata="Q1362485" url="?curid=955389" title="Ertebølle culture">
<text>The Ertebølle culture ( BCE – 3,950 BCE) () is a hunter-gatherer and fisher, pottery-making culture dating to the end of the Mesolithic period. The culture was concentrated in Southern Scandinavia. It is named after the type site, a location in the small village of Ertebølle on Limfjorden in Danish Jutland. In the 1890s the National Museum of Denmark excavated heaps of oyster shells there, mixed with mussels, snails, bones, and artefacts of bone, antler, and flint, which were evaluated as kitchen middens (Danish &#x27;), or refuse dumps. Accordingly, the culture is less-commonly named theKitchen Midden. As it is approximately identical to the Ellerbek culture of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], the combined name,Ertebølle-Ellerbekis often used. The Ellerbek culture (German&#x27;) is named after a type site in Ellerbek, a community on the edge of Kiel, Germany.

In the 1960s and 1970s another closely related culture was found in the (now dry) Noordoostpolder in the Netherlands, near the village Swifterbant and the former island of Urk. Named the Swifterbant culture (5,300 – 3,400 BCE) they show a transition from hunter-gatherer to both animal husbandry, primarily cows and pigs, and cultivation of barley and emmer wheat. During the formative stages contact with nearby Linear Pottery culture settlements in Limburg has been detected. Like the Ertebølle culture, they lived near open water, in this case creeks, riverdunes, and bogs along post-glacial banks of the Overijsselse Vechte. Recent excavations show a local continuity going back to (at least) 5,600 BCE, when burial practices resembled the contemporary gravefields in Denmark and South Sweden &quot;in all details&quot;, suggesting only part of a diverse ancestral &quot;Ertebølle&quot;-like heritage was locally continued into the later (Middle Neolithic) Swifterbant tradition (4,200 – 3,400 BCE).

The Ertebølle culture was roughly contemporaneous with the Linear Pottery culture, food-producers whose northernmost border was located just to the south. The Ertebølle did not practice agriculture but it did utilize domestic grain in some capacity, which it must have obtained from the south.

The Ertebølle culture replaced the earlier Kongemose culture of Denmark. It was limited to the north by the Scandinavian Nøstvet and Lihult cultures. It is divided into an early phase BCE – BCE, and a later phase BCE – 3,950 BCE. Shortly after 4,100 BCE the Ertebølle began to expand along the Baltic coast at least as far as Rügen. Shortly thereafter it was replaced by the Funnelbeaker culture.

In recent years archaeologists have found the acronym EBK most convenient, parallel to LBK for German &#x27; ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) and TRB for German&#x27;, Danish (Funnelbeaker culture), and Dutch &quot;&quot;. Ostensibly for &quot;Ertebølle Kultur&quot;, EBK could be either German or Danish, and has the added advantage that Ellerbek also begins with E.

==Description==

===Environment===
The Ertebølle culture falls within the Atlantic climate period and the Littorina Sea phase of the Baltic Sea basin; that is, climate was warmer and moister than today, deciduous forests covered Europe, and the Baltic was at higher levels than today, and was a salt sea, rather than a brackish one or a lake. The Baltic coastline was often flooded to a level of 5m-6m higher than now. Jutland was an archipelago. Marshes were extensive, with tracts of shallow water rich in fish. The environment itself thus invited settlement.

The Ertebølle population settled on promontories, near or on beaches, on islands, and along rivers and estuaries away from the dense forests. The environment most like the then range of the Ertebølle is the Wadden Sea region of the North Sea from the Netherlands to Denmark. Due to chance fluctuations in the sea level during Ertebølle occupation of the coast and subsequently, many of the culture sites are currently under 3m-4m of water. Some have been excavated by underwater archaeology. The artifacts are in an excellent state of preservation, having been protected by anaerobic mud. On the disadvantage side, water movements have disrupted many sites.

===Cultural remains===
The Ertebølle population derived its living from a variety of means, but chiefly from the sea. They prospered, grew healthy and multiplied on a diet of fish. They were masters of the inland waters, which they traversed in paddled dugouts. Like many peoples known in history, they were able to hunt whales and seals from their dugouts. Their materials were mainly wood, with bone, antler and flint for functions requiring harder surfaces. Homes were constructed of brush or light wood. The materials encourage us to view them as transitory. They were, nevertheless, able to place the dead in longer-used cemeteries. Perhaps the dwelling-places were transitory, but the territories were not.

===Physical anthropology===

Skeletal remains are relatively meagre. They have been studied and described in great detail from an anthropometric, or &quot;man-measuring&quot;, point of view. Without resorting to this specialised language, the main conclusions are as follows. On the one hand they did not differ from the current inhabitants of Denmark in skeleton. Soft tissue features, being known through reconstruction only, leave some room for variation.

On the other hand, many skulls evidence facial features or dimensions of Cro-Magnons. The latter type prevailed in Late Paleolithic times in Europe, supplanting Neanderthal man there. Genetic analysis by scientists from the University of Ferrara (Italy) indicates that the Cro-Magnons were ancestral to the current population of Europe.

Two hypotheses concerning the origin of the Ertebølle population are therefore possible and have been proposed. One is that in the remains we are seeing an intermediate phase in the evolution of the population of Scania. The second is that the Ertebølle population was an admixture of agrarian southerners with indigenous Scanians over a permeable border. Both views are supported by the evidence.

===Evidence of conflict===
There is some evidence of conflict between Ertebølle settlements: an arrowhead in a pelvis at Skateholm, Sweden; a bone point in a throat at Vedbæk, Zealand; a bone point in the chest at Stora Biers, Sweden. More significant is evidence of cannibalism at Dyrholmen, Jutland, and Møllegabet on Ærø. There human bones were broken open to obtain the marrow. The evidence of marrow exploitation in the Ertebølle remains indicates dietary rather than ritual cannibalism; as marrow is never the subject of ritualistic cannibalism.

===Similar cultures===
The Ertebølle culture is of a general type called Late Mesolithic, of which other examples can be found in Swifterbant culture, Zedmar culture, Narva culture and in Russia. Some would include the Nøstvet culture and Lihult culture to the north as well. The various locations seem fragmented and isolated, but that characteristic may be an accident of discovery. Perhaps if all the submarine sites were known, a continuous coastal culture would appear from the Netherlands to the lakes of Russia, but this has yet to be demonstrated.

==Economy==

Ertebølle peoples lived primarily on seafood.

===Fishing industry===
The mainstay of Ertebølle economy was fish. Three main methods of fishing are supported by the evidence, such as the boats and other equipment found in fragmentary form at Tybrind Vig and elsewhere: trapping, angling, and spearing.

To trap fish, the fishermen constructed fish fences, or weirs, of approximately 4m-long hazel sticks set upright in the mud at the bottom of shallow water. The fish must have been corralled by some method and then harvested at will. Wickerwork traps were also used.

Ertebølle fishermen angled with hooks made of red deer bone, of which at least one example has been found with line attached. They spear-fished with spears made of shafts to which hazel tines were attached. Boats were dugouts a few feet wide propelled by paddles constructed of shafts to which leaf-shaped or heart-shaped blades were attached. At one end a layer of clay spread on the bottom supported hot coals, an indispensable source of heat if you were going to spend much time in the boat.

Dozens of species of fish have been found in the middens. Some of the most common are pike, whitefish, cod, and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (&quot;Engraulis encrasicolus&quot;), three-spined stickleback (&quot;Gasterosteus aculeatus&quot;) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, featured remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, smoothhound, and (at Lystrup Enge) spurdog. At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and European perch were found. The presence of deep-sea fish and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water. Whether they did so in their marshland dugouts or also owned larger, ocean-going ones is an answer that waits for more evidence.

===Whaling and sealing industry===
At Lystrup Enge, Yderhede and other places the bones of cetaceans and pinnipeds have been found; specifically, of killer whales, the white-beaked dolphin, and the bottlenose dolphin among the cetaceans. These are not animals requiring whaling voyages on the high seas. They could have been washed onto the shore or hunted in shallow waters.

The seals are the ringed seal, the harp seal and the grey seal. These animals for the most part were common in the Littorina Sea but are not found in the Baltic Sea now. Again, they could have been taken on land or in the shallows.

The species found raise the question of whether a whaling or sealing industry existed as such or whether the bones came from opportunistic scavenging. There is no direct evidence of voyaging out in dugouts to harpoon whales that could kill the voyagers in an instant. However, one of the two main types of pottery used was the blubber lamp, a small, oval deep dish in which you ignited a chunk of blubber or even oil with a wick. The widespread use of this lamp implies a widespread industry to obtain blubber; i.e., professional whale and seal hunting.

===Hunting industry===
Judging from the remains of animal bones at their sites, the Ertebølle people hunted mainly three types of land animals: large forest browsers, fur animals and maritime birds.

The forest mammals are the red deer and roe deer, which were dietary staples, and the wild boar, european elk, less frequently the aurochs, and a rare horse, believed to have been wild. Only a left foreleg from Østenkær remains. It offers definitive proof that horses lived in the forests of Europe. On the plains to the east they are only found in association with man. The boar were supplemented by swine with mixed European and Near Eastern ancestry, obtained through their Neolithic farming neighbors, as early as 4,600 BCE.

The fur animals are fairly widespread: the beaver, squirrel, polecat, badger, fox, lynx. Furs might have served as a currency and may have been traded to some degree, but this is speculation.

Maritime birds must have been easily taken in the marshes and ponds of the region: red-throated diver, black-throated diver, Dalmatian pelican, capercaille, grebe, cormorant, swan, and duck.

In addition are a few others: the dog and the wolf, and two snakes, the common grass snake, and the Aesculapian snake. As snakes do not appear in the art, it is impossible to say what cultural impact they had, if any.

===Plant use===
The EBK gathered berries for consumption and also prepared a number of wild plants, judging from the seed remains of plants that could not be consumed without preparation. Of the berries that have been found are raspberry (&quot;Rubus idaeus&quot;), dewberry (&quot;Rubus caesius&quot;), wild strawberry, dogwood (&quot;Cornus sanguinea&quot;), hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot; and &quot;Crataegus oxyacantha&quot;), rowanberry (&quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot;), crab apple, and rose hips.

Some seeds usually made into gruel in historical times are acorn and manna grass (&quot;Glyceria fluitans&quot;). Roots of the sea beet (&quot;Beta maritima&quot;) were prepared as well. That species is ancestral to modern domestic beets. Greens could have been boiled from nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;), orache (&quot;Atriplex&quot;), and goosefoot (&quot;Chenopodium album&quot;).

Some of the pottery evidences grain impressions, which some interpret as the use of food imported from the south. Certainly, they did not need to import food and were probably better nourished than the southerners. Analysis of charred remains in one pot indicates that it at least was used for fermenting a mixture of blood and nuts. Some have therefore guessed that fermentation of grain was used to produce beer.

Finally, fragments of textiles from Tybrind Vig were woven in the needle-netting technique from spun plant fibers.

==Tools and art==

===Settlement life===
The many settlements on the coast and in the hinterland vary between large all-year-round settlements and smaller seasonal settlements. A settlement consisted of huts, probably brush supported by posts. The huts were in no special order. Fire pits located outside the huts indicate that most village functions were performed outdoors, with the dwellings used perhaps for storage and sleeping. At the time winters were mild.

An external fireplace from Ronaes Skae was constructed as a perimeter of stones surrounding a mud and clay hearth on which charred wood was found in a spoke pattern. The wood was collected from the shore. Fungus was used for tinder.

===Pottery===

Pottery was manufactured from native clays tempered with sand, crushed stone and organic material. The EBK pot was made by coil technique, being fired on the open bed of hot coals. It was not like the neighbouring Neolithic Linearbandkeramik and appears related instead to a pottery type that first appears in Europe in the Samara region of Russia cal BCE, and spread up the Volga to the Eastern Baltic and then westward along the shore.

Two main types are found, a beaker and a lamp. The beaker is a pot-bellied pot narrowing at the neck, with a flanged, outward-turning rim. The bottom was typically formed into a point or bulb (the &quot;funnel&quot;) of some sort that supported the pot when it was placed in clay or sand. One can imagine a sort of mobile pantry consisting of rows of jars set now in the hut, now by the fire, now in the clay layer at the bottom of a dugout.

The beaker came in various sizes from 8 to 50 cm high and from 5 to 20 cm in diameter. Decoration filled the entire surface with horizontal bands of fingertip or fingernail impressions. It must have been in the decoration phase that grains of wheat and barley left their impression in the clay. Late in the period technique and decoration became slightly more varied and sophisticated: the walls were thinner and different motifs were used in the impressions: chevrons, cord marks, and punctures made with animal bones. Handles are sometimes added and the rims may turn in instead of out.

The blubber lamp was molded from a single piece of clay. The use of such lamps suggests some household activity in the huts after dark.

===Tool kit===

The flint industry evolved a high and unified standard with small and flake axes, long lithic flakes (knives), and arrow heads. However, tools of many materials were in use: wood prongs and points, antler parts, carved bone tools.

===Art===
Paddles from Tybrind Vig show traces of highly developed and artistic woodcarving. This is an example of the embellishment of functional pieces. The population also polished and engraved non-functional or not obviously functional pieces of bone or antler. Motifs were predominantly geometric with some anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms. Also in evidence (for example, at Fanø) are polished amber representations of animals, such as birds, boars, and bears. Jewelry was made of animal teeth or decorative shells. To what extent any of these pieces were symbolic of wealth and status is not clear.

===Funerary customs===

Cemeteries, such as the ones at Vedbæk and Skateholm, give a &quot;sedentary&quot; character to the settlements. Red ochre and deer antlers were placed in some graves, but not others. Some social distinctions may therefore have been made. There was some appreciation of sexual dimorphism: the women wore necklaces and belts of animal teeth and shells. No special body position was used. Both burial and cremation were practiced. At Møllegabet, an individual was buried in a dugout, which some see as the beginning of Scandinavian boat burials.

Skateholm contained also a dog cemetery. Dog graves were prepared and gifted the same as human, with ochre, antler, and grave goods. In either history or prehistory the dog is an invaluable animal and is often treated as a person.

<text>Flood alerts are issued by weather agencies to alert residents that flood conditions are a possibility.

==Types of flood alerts in the United States==
In the United States, a flash flood watch is issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) when weather conditions are favorable for very heavy rain that could cause flooding or flash flooding. A watch does not mean that flooding is occurring, only that weather conditions have created or will create a significant risk for it. If flooding occurs, a flood warning or flash flood warning would be issued, and immediate action should be taken. A flood warning or flash flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or already occurring. When flood warnings are issued, it means that area waterways will likely soon be in flood. Not all flood watches suggest that large-scale flooding, such as during landfalling tropical cyclones, is possible.

==Flood alerts in other countries==
In Canada, a heavy rainfall warning, which indicates rainfall amounts that &quot;could&quot; produce flooding are expected, has basically the same meaning as a flood watch.

In Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology issues a flood watch that covers similar conditions to flood watches in the United States. However, they are known by slightly different names in some areas.

In Europe, there is the European Flood Awareness System and the commercial product including app and data services FloodAlert.

<text>Wooden Nickel Records was an American independent record label started in 1971 by Bill Traut, Jim Golden and Jerry Weintraub as a successor to Dunwich Records. Most of Wooden Nickel&#x27;s releases were by acts based in the Chicago area, including the Siegel–Schwall Band, James Lee Stanley, Megan McDonough and Styx. The label had a distribution deal with RCA Records. Wooden Nickel ceased operations after its top act, Styx, signed with A&amp;M Records in 1975. The label sued the band for breach of contract, then was formally disbanded in 1977.

*Varèse Sarabande/Varèse Vintage VSD-6006 - The Very Best of the Siegel-Schwall Band: The Wooden Nickel Years (1971-1974) - Siegel-Schwall Band [1999]

===Singles: 65 prefix series===
Wooden Nickel singles, like the albums, started with their own numbering system, but in 1973 were put into the consolidated RCA numbering system where they shared a catalog numbering sequence with all of the RCA-distributed labels. The label design was the same as for the albums, that is, a brown, wood-like color with a buffalo nickel backdrop, and &quot;wooden nickel&quot; in white at the top of the label. Promotional records used the same design, with &quot;NOT FOR SALE&quot; printed on the label. Promo copies usually featured the same song on both sides, one mono and one stereo. The deejay numbers on the 65-0100 series were completely different (e.g., the promo issue of &quot;Guitar Picker&quot; was SP/SPS-45-314 vs. the commercial issue of 65-0105). The WB-10000 series deejay issues used the same numbers, but with a &quot;JH-&quot; prefix instead of &quot;WB-&quot;.

===Singles: RCA APB0 series===
The series used four prefix characters, the first of which indicated if the single was on the RCA parent label (=A) or a subsidiary/distributed label (=B). The second letter indicated the label, with &quot;W&quot; indicating Wooden Nickel. The third letter was mostly &quot;B&quot; except for a few pop artists&#x27; reissues (=A). The final character was intended to always be a &quot;0&quot; (zero), but was often erroneously typeset as a capital O. Since several labels shared the sequence, the Wooden Nickel numbers are not continuous.

<doc id="955405" wikidata="Q1700759" url="?curid=955405" title="Rutherfurd (crater)">
<text>Rutherfurd is a lunar impact crater located entirely within the southern rim of the much larger crater Clavius. The crater Porter is located to the north-northeast of Rutherfurd, on the northeastern rim of Clavius. Rutherfurd forms the larger member in an arcing chain of craters of decreasing size that curves across the floor of Clavius. The craters in this chain do not appear to be the same age, so this formation is most likely random in nature.

Rutherfurd is somewhat oval in shape, with the long axis oriented approximately in a north–south direction. The northern outer s have a series of radiating ridges on the floor of Clavius. The rim overlies the inner wall of Clavius, and thus the rim of Rutherfurd is higher above the surface along the north and west sides. The floor is irregular in shape, and there is a central peak somewhat offset to the northeast. The ejecta pattern, oblong shape, and location of the central peak indicate the original impact may have been at a low angle from the southeast. Due to its rays, Rutherfurd is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

The crater was named by and for astrophotographer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd who took the first telescopic photographs of the moon.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rutherfurd.

<doc id="955407" wikidata="Q2199151" url="?curid=955407" title="Thelonious Monster">
<text>Thelonious Monster is an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, led by singer-songwriter Bob Forrest and named after jazz musician Thelonious Monk. Active from 1984 to 1994, again from 2004 to 2011, and reforming a second time in 2019, the band has released five original studio albums. The band has a large cult following and is considered to be a seminal and influential band in the 1980s L.A. underground music scene, alongside acts like Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Red Hot Chili Peppers. They&#x27;ve been described as having &quot;traced emotional dips and bends with exceptional acuity and impact&quot;.

== Members ==
Members include Forrest on vocals; bass players Jon Huck, Rob Graves, Dallas Don Burnett and Martyn LeNoble; guitarists Chris Handsone, Bill Stobaugh, Dix Denney, Zander Schloss, Mike Martt, K.K. Barrett, Jon Sidel; and drummer Pete Weiss. They were a popular live attraction in the underground rock clubs of Hollywood in the 1980s but never achieved major commercial success.

In 1988, guitarist John Frusciante auditioned for Thelonious Monster. He was in the band for only three hours before being asked to join the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Josh Klinghoffer was featured on their fifth studio album and would eventually go on to replace John Frusciante in the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==History==

=== 1984–1994: Initial success ===
Their 1986 debut album, &quot;Baby...You&#x27;re Bummin&#x27; My Life out in a Supreme Fashion&quot; was described as &quot;bluesy, jazzy, snaggle-toothed singer-songwriter pop blaring through a busted speaker.&quot;

1987 saw the release of &quot;Next Saturday Afternoon&quot;, long time &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; music critic Robert Hilburn wrote that it would be &quot;prized by those who crave penetrating and perceptive rock ‘n’ roll. In its best moments, the LP explores questions of identity and self-worth in stark, unflinching ways that recall the passion and purpose of some of rock&#x27;s classic collections.&quot; 1989 saw the release of &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, called &quot;still far from the smooth or dance-happy edges preferred by mainstream radio, the album is more accessible than its predecessor. There are some winning melodic touches amid the occasional all-out, slam-bam rock ‘n’ roll.&quot; The two albums were released on a single CD in 1989.

In 1992, the band released &quot;Beautiful Mess&quot; on Capitol Records. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;another series of soul-searching tunes about relationships and self-doubts. What distinguishes Forrest’s music is the absence of self-pity. In the tradition of John Lennon, Forrest is capable of expressing irony or anger in a social context, but he recognizes the enemy is often within.&quot; The following tour brought the band around the world, including a notorious set in which Forrest climbed on the roof of the main stage at the 1993 Pinkpop Festival in The Netherlands.

=== 2004–present: Reunion shows and later albums ===
After several years of sporadic activity and Forrest&#x27;s tenure with The Bicycle Thief, Thelonious Monster reunited in 2004 at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California and at the Sunset Junction Street Fair in Los Angeles, and released their first new album in 12 years. &quot;California Clam Chowder&quot; would feature guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who was also a member of Forrest&#x27;s short-lived band, The Bicycle Thief. 

In 2009 Thelonious Monster reunited for their first shows in five years. The band played a show at The Echo in Los Angeles as a warm-up for dates on Warped Tour, and a show at Pappy And Harriet&#x27;s in Pioneertown, California. Former members of Thelonious Monster are featured in the 2011 documentary &quot;Bob and the Monster&quot;, which details the life and career of Bob Forrest.

In 2019, Bob announced on his Instagram account that Thelonious Monster were in the studio working on a new album. He also posted a photo of Dix Denney and Josh Klinghoffer working in the studio. The album &quot;Oh That Monster&quot; was released in 2020 on United States Election Day. The band scheduled a 2021 album tour.

On January 19, 2024, the band played what Bob Forrest described as &quot;the last ever Thelonious Monster show&quot; at a tribute concert to guitarist Mike Martt, who died in 2023.

<text>Sir Douglas Colin Cameron KCMG (June 8, 1854 – November 27, 1921) was a Canadian politician. He served in the Ontario Legislature from 1902 to 1905, and was the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1911 to 1916.

Cameron was born in Hawkesbury, Canada West (now Ontario), and was educated at Vankleek Hill High School. He did not attend college. Cameron moved to Manitoba in 1878, and worked as a contractor at Brandon.

Cameron then moved to Rat Portage (now Kenora), which was claimed by both Manitoba and Ontario at the time. He oversaw developments in the lumbering and mining trades, opened a saw mill, and was one of the founders of the Maple Leaf Flour Mills. In later years, he would become President of Rat Portage Lumber Company.

Cameron entered politics in 1901, having been elected as a councillor in Rat Portage. He would later serve as the city&#x27;s mayor. In 1902, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal for the riding of Fort William and Lake of the Woods, defeating Conservative Thomas Smellie, 1483 votes to 1121. Cameron sat as a backbench supporter of Premier George Ross for the next three years.

The Liberals lost the election of 1905, and Cameron lost his own riding to Smellie, 1536 votes to 1228. Shortly thereafter, he moved to Winnipeg to better oversee his business ventures.

Cameron stood as a Liberal candidate for Winnipeg in the 1908 federal election, but lost to Conservative Alexander Haggart by 8747 votes to 6729.

Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier appointed Cameron Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba on August 1, 1911. The position was largely ceremonial by this time, and Cameron had little involvement in the day-to-day affairs of the province&#x27;s government. In 1915, however, Cameron used his constitutional authority to call a Royal Commission of Enquiry into an ongoing scandal involving the construction costs of the province&#x27;s new legislative buildings. The Commission upheld charges against Rodmond P. Roblin&#x27;s government by the opposition Liberals, and Roblin was forced to resign.

Cameron was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1914 New Year Honours.

Cameron&#x27;s term in office ended in 1916. He died in 1921.

<doc id="955409" wikidata="Q633171" url="?curid=955409" title="The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)">
<text>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (also known as The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3) is a 1974 American crime drama film directed by Joseph Sargent and starring Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam and Héctor Elizondo. Peter Stone adapted the screenplay from the 1973 novel of the same name written by Morton Freedgood under the pen name John Godey.

The film follows a group of criminals who hijack a New York City Subway car and hold the passengers for ransom. The title is derived from the train&#x27;s radio call sign, which is based on where and when the train began its run; in this case, the train originated at the Pelham Bay Park station in the Bronx at 1:23 p.m. For several years after the film was released, the New York City Transit Authority would not schedule any train to leave Pelham Bay Park station at 1:23.

The film received critical acclaim. Several critics called it one of 1974&#x27;s finest films, and it was a box-office success. The music has been described as &quot;one of the best and most inventive thriller scores of the 1970s&quot;. It was remade in 1998 as a television film and in 2009 as a theatrical film.

==Plot==
In New York City, four men wearing similar disguises and carrying concealed weapons board the same downtown 6 train, &quot;Pelham 1-2-3&quot;, at different stations. Using the code names Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown, they take 18 people, including the conductor and an undercover police officer, hostage in the front car.

Communicating over the radio with New York City Transit Police lieutenant Zachary Garber, Blue demands that a $1million ransom be delivered within exactly one hour or he will kill one hostage for every minute it is late. Green sneezes periodically, to which Garber always responds, &quot;Gesundheit&quot;. Garber, Lt. Patrone and others cooperate while speculating about the hijackers&#x27; escape plan. Garber surmises that one hijacker must be a former motorman because they were able to uncouple the head car and park it farther down the tunnel below 28th Street.

Conversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue is a former British Army colonel and was a mercenary in Africa; Green was a motorman caught in a drug bust; and Blue does not trust Grey, who was ousted from the Mafia for being erratic. Unexpectedly, Grey shoots and kills transit supervisor Caz Dolowicz, sent from Grand Central, as he approaches the stalled train.

The ransom is transported uptown in a speeding police car that crashes well before arriving at 28th Street. As the deadline is reached, Garber bluffs Blue by claiming that the money has reached the station entrance and just has to be walked down the tunnel to the train. Meanwhile, a police motorcycle arrives with the ransom. As two patrolmen carry the money down the tunnel, one of the many police snipers in the tunnel shoots at Brown, and the hijackers exchange gunfire with the police. In retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.

The money is delivered and divided among the hijackers. Blue orders Garber to restore power to the subway line, set the signals to green all the way to South Ferry, and clear the police from stations along the route. Before the process is complete, however, Green moves the train farther south. When Garber becomes alarmed, Blue explains that he wanted more distance from the police inside the tunnel.

The hijackers override the dead man&#x27;s switch so that the train will run without anyone at the controls. Garber joins Inspector Daniels above ground where the train stopped. The hijackers set the train in motion and get off. As they walk to the tunnel&#x27;s emergency exit, the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails. Unaware that the hijackers have left the train, Garber and Daniels drive south above its route. With no one at the controls, the train gains speed.

The hijackers collect their disguises and weapons for disposal, but Grey refuses to surrender his gun, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who kills him. The undercover officer kills Brown and exchanges fire with Blue while Green escapes through an emergency exit onto the street.

Garber, contemplating the train&#x27;s suspicious last movement, concludes that the hijackers have bypassed the dead-man feature and are no longer on board. He returns to where the train had stopped, enters the same emergency exit from street level, and confronts Blue as he is about to kill the undercover officer. With no escape, Blue electrocutes himself by deliberately placing his foot against the third rail.

Meanwhile, Pelham 123 hurtles through the southbound tunnel. When it enters the South Ferry loop, its speed triggers the automatic safeties. It screeches to a halt, leaving the hostages bruised but safe.

Since none of the three dead hijackers was a motorman, Garber infers that the lone survivor must be. Working their way through a list of recently discharged motormen, Garber and Patrone knock on the door of Harold Longman (Green). After hastily hiding the loot, Longman lets them in, bluffs his way through their interrogation, and complains indignantly about being suspected. Garber vows to return with a search warrant. As Garber closes the apartment door behind him, Longman sneezes, and Garber reflexively says &quot;Gesundheit&quot;, as he had over the radio. Garber re-opens the door and gives Longman a caustic stare.

==Cast==

==Production==
Godey&#x27;s novel was published in February 1973 by Putnam, but Palomar Productions had secured the film rights, and Dell had bought the paperback rights months earlier in September 1972. The paperback rights sold for (equivalent to $million in ).

Godey (Morton Freedgood) was a &quot;subway buff&quot;. The novel and the film came out during the so-called &quot;Golden Age&quot; of skyjacking in the United States from 1968 through 1979. Additionally, New York City was edging toward a financial crisis; crime had risen citywide, and the subway was perceived as neither safe nor reliable.

At first, the New York City Transit Authority (TA) refused to cooperate with the filmmakers. Godey&#x27;s novel was more detailed about how the hijackers would accomplish their goal and recognized that the caper&#x27;s success did not rely solely on defeating the &quot;deadman feature&quot; in the motorman&#x27;s cab. Screenwriter Stone, however, made a fictional override mechanism the linchpin of the script. Director Sargent explained, &quot;We&#x27;re making a movie, not a handbook on subway hijacking. ... I must admit the seriousness of &quot;Pelham&quot; never occurred to me until we got the initial TA reaction. They thought it potentially a stimulant—not to hardened professional criminals like the ones in our movie, but to kooks. Cold professionals can see the absurdities of the plot right off, but kooks don&#x27;t reason it out. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re kooks. Yes, we gladly gave in about the &#x27;deadman feature&#x27;. Any responsible filmmaker would if he stumbled onto something that could spread into a new form of madness.&quot;

Sargent said, &quot;It&#x27;s important that we don&#x27;t be too plausible. We&#x27;re counting on the film&#x27;s style and charm and comedy to say, subliminally at least, &#x27;Don&#x27;t take us too seriously. The credits have a disclaimer that the TA did not give advice or information for use in the film.

After eight weeks of negotiations, and through the influence of Mayor John Lindsay, the TA relented but required that the producers take out $20 million in insurance policies, including special &quot;kook coverage&quot; in case the movie inspired a real-life hijacking. This was in addition to a $250,000 fee for use of the track, station, subway cars and TA personnel.

The TA also insisted that no graffiti appear in the film. Graffiti had become increasingly prevalent on trains starting in 1969. Mayor Lindsay had first announced his intention to remove graffiti in 1972, but the last graffiti-covered car was not removed from service until 1989. &quot;New Yorkers are going to hoot when they see our spotless subway cars,&quot; Sargent said. &quot;But the TA was adamant on that score. They said to show graffiti would be to glorify it. We argued that it was artistically expressive. But we got nowhere. They said the graffiti fad would be dead by the time the movie got out. I really doubt that.&quot;

Other changes included beefing up Matthau&#x27;s role. In the novel, Garber is the equivalent of the Patrone character in the film. &quot;I like the piece,&quot; Matthau said. &quot;It moves swiftly and stays interesting right down to the wire. That&#x27;s the reason I wanted to do it. The TA inspector I play is really a supporting role—they built it up a bit when I expressed interest in it—but it&#x27;s still secondary.&quot; In the novel, Inspector Daniels confronts Mr. Blue in the tunnel during the climax. Additionally, screenwriter Peter Stone gave the hijackers their color code names, with hats whose colors matched their code names, as well as Longman his telltale cold.

Filming began on November 23, 1973, and was completed in late April 1974. The budget was $3.8 million.

===Filming locations===
Production began with scenes inside the subway tunnel. These were filmed over the course of eight weeks on the local tracks of the IND Fulton Street Line at the abandoned Court Street station in Brooklyn. Closed to the public in 1946, it became a filming location and later home to the New York Transit Museum. Among other films, the Court Street station was used for &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974), and the 2009 remake of &quot;Pelham&quot;.

The production company set up chess boards, card tables, and ping pong tables along the Court Street platform for cast and crew recreation between set-ups. Robert Shaw apparently beat all comers in ping pong.

Although this was an abandoned spur of track, passing A, E and GG trains rumbled through adjacent tracks on their regular schedules. Dialogue that was marred by the noise was later post-dubbed. The third rail, which carries 600 volts of direct current, was shut off, and three protective bars were placed against the rail, but the cast and crew were told to treat it as if it were still live. &quot;Those TA people ... are super careful,&quot; Sargent said. &quot;They anticipate everything. By the fifth week we were dancing our way through those tunnels like nobody&#x27;s business. They were expecting that, too. That&#x27;s when they told us of the fatalities in the tunnels. They&#x27;re mostly old-timers. The young guys still have a healthy fear of the place.&quot;

&quot;There was one scene where Robert Shaw was to step on the third rail,&quot; Sargent recalled. &quot;When we were rehearsing the scene, Shaw accidentally stubbed his toe and the sparks from his special-effects boot flew everywhere. He turned white as a sheet. We had eight weeks of that. I think we got out just in time. It was like coal mining.&quot;

According to a notation on IMDb, the crew wore surgical masks during the tunnel scenes. Shaw&#x27;s biographer John French reported, &quot;There were rats everywhere and every time someone jumped from the train, or tripped over the lines, clouds of black dust rose into the air, making it impossible to shoot until it had settled.&quot;

Matthau, who had one scene in the tunnel, said, &quot;There are bacteria down there that haven&#x27;t been discovered yet. And bugs. Big ugly bugs from the planet Uranus. They all settled in the New York subway tunnels. I saw one bug mug a guy. I wasn&#x27;t down there a long time—but long enough to develop the strangest cold I ever had. It stayed in my nose for five days, then went to my throat. Finally I woke up one morning with no voice at all, and they had to shut down for the day.&quot;

According to &quot;Backstage&quot;, the filmmakers were the first to use a &quot;flash&quot; process developed by Movielabs to bring out detail when shooting with low light in the tunnel. The process reportedly increased film speed by two stops. It allowed the filmmakers to use fewer lights and generators, and cut five days out of the schedule.

At least two R22 trains portrayed Pelham 123. As it enters the 28th Street station, the head car is labeled 7339. However, in an early scene at Grand Central, 7339 is seen on the express track across the platform. Later, after being cut from the rest of the train, the head car is labeled 7434. R22 cars first went into service in April 1957, and the vast majority of the 450 cars were scrapped in 1987.

After two months in the tunnel, production moved to Filmways Studios at 246 East 127th Street in East Harlem, where a replica of the Transit Authority&#x27;s Brooklyn control center was constructed. Built around 1920 as Cosmopolitan Studios, the facility was leased in 1928 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for sound production and purchased by Filmways in 1959. Among later films that were shot there were &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; (1960), &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978) and &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979). The building was demolished in the 1980s.

The exterior street scenes above the hijacked subway train were filmed at the subway entrance at 28th and Park Avenue South in Manhattan. The mayor&#x27;s residence, Gracie Mansion, was used for exteriors. Wave Hill, a nineteenth-century mansion overlooking the Hudson River in Riverdale, the Bronx, was used for the interior scenes set in Gracie Mansion.

===Music===
The score, composed and conducted by David Shire, &quot;layers explosive horn arrangements and serpentine keyboard riffs over a rhythm section that pits hard-grooving basslines against constantly shifting but always insistent layers of percussion&quot;. Shire used the 12-tone composition method to create unusual, somewhat dissonant melodic elements.

The soundtrack album was the first CD release by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; and was soon released by Retrograde Records. The end titles contain a more expansive arrangement of the theme, courtesy of Shire&#x27;s wife at the time, Talia Shire, who suggested that he end the score with a more traditional ode to New York.

==Release==
&quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; was released to theaters on October 2, 1974.

===Critical reception===
The film holds a 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews and a weighted average of 8.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Breezy, thrilling, and quite funny, &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; sees Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw pitted against each other in effortlessly high form.&quot;

The film was well received by critics. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a good action caper&quot;, but &quot;the major liability is Peter Stone&#x27;s screenplay, which develops little interest in either Matthau or Shaw&#x27;s gang, nor the innocent hostages&quot;, who are &quot;simply stereotyped baggage&quot;. Although the trade paper complained that the Mayor was &quot;played for silly laughs&quot;, it called Shaw &quot;superb in another versatile characterization&quot;.

&quot;BoxOffice&quot; thought that &quot;some of the excitement has been lost&quot; translating the novel to the screen, but &quot;there is entertainment value in Peter Stone&#x27;s screenplay&quot;.

Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought that it captured the mood of New York and New Yorkers. &quot;Throughout there&#x27;s a skillful balance between the vulnerability of New Yorkers and the drastic, provocative sense of comedy that thrives all over our sidewalks. And the hijacking seems like a perfectly probable event for this town. (Perhaps the only element of fantasy is the implication that the city&#x27;s departments could function so smoothly together). Meanwhile, the movie adds up to a fine piece of reporting—and it&#x27;s the only action picture I&#x27;ve seen this year that has a rousing plot.&quot;

The film was one of several released that year that gave New York a bad image, including &quot;Law and Disorder&quot;, &quot;Death Wish&quot;, &quot;Serpico&quot; and &quot;The Super Cops&quot;. Vincent Canby, another critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;New York is a mess, say these films. It&#x27;s run by fools. Its citizens are at the mercy of its criminals who, as often as not, are protected by an unholy alliance of civil libertarians and crooked cops. The air is foul. The traffic impossible. Services are diminishing and the morale is such that ordering a cup of coffee in a diner can turn into a request for a fat lip.&quot; But &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot;, &quot;compared to the general run of New York City films, is practically a tonic, a good-humored, often witty suspense melodrama in which the representatives of law and decency triumph without bending the rules.&quot;

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called it &quot;fast, funny and fairly terrifying&quot; and &quot;a nerve-racking ride&quot;, and appreciated the &quot;wry humor&quot; of Stone&#x27;s script. It tapped into a darker reality: &quot;A short time ago subways were safe; today some of them are full of the dark rage of asylums. And who really is to say a Pelham-type incident is out of the question?&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;coarse-textured and effective, a cartoon-vivid melodrama and not, it&#x27;s nice to know, a case study of psychopathic behavior. &#x27;Pelham&#x27; is in fact the best to date of the new multiple-jeopardy capers, fresh, lively and suspenseful... . There are some marvelously managed scenes in the subway tunnels and on teeming platforms and at the barricaded street-level entrances. The subway nerve center is fascinating, and indeed one of the pleasures of the film is its glimpse of how things work... . The violence is handled with restraint; the dangers are mixed with raucous humor and what stays clear is that the aim is swift entertainment.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4. He praised the film&#x27;s &quot;unforced realism&quot; and the supporting characters who elevated what could have been a predictable crime thriller: &quot;We care about the people not the plot mechanics. And what could have been formula trash turns out to be fairly classy trash, after all.&quot;
Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, describing it as a &quot;solid new thriller laced with equal amounts of tension and comedy&quot;.

===Accolades===
BAFTA Awards
* 1976: Nominated, &quot;Best Film Music&quot;—David Shire
* 1976: Nominated, &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot;—Martin Balsam

Writers Guild of America Award
* 1975: Nominated, &quot;Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium&quot;—Peter Stone

==Remakes==
In 1998, the film was remade as a television film with the same title, with Edward James Olmos in the role that Walter Matthau played in the movie, and Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio replacing Shaw as the senior hijacker. Although not particularly well received by critics or viewers, this version was reportedly more faithful to the book, although it revised the setting with new technologies. It was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, and is jokingly referred to as “The Taking of Bloor Street 123”.

Another remake, set in post 9/11 New York City, directed by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta, was released in 2009 to mixed reviews.

==Legacy==
The color-coded thieves&#x27; names in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; was a deliberate homage by Quentin Tarantino to &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot;. The film has also been cited as an inspiration for the making of the 2024 film &quot;Anora&quot; by Sean Baker.

<text>2C-T-8 is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, sometimes used as an entheogen.

==Chemistry==
The full name of the chemical is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyclopropylmethylthiophenethylamine. The compound is reported to have a bad taste and smell.

==Effects==
In his book &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, Shulgin lists the dosage range as 30 to 50 mg. 2C-T-8 is generally taken orally and effects typically last 10 to 15 hours. Experiences have varied between insight and creativity at low doses to hypersensitivity and paranoia at higher doses. A &quot;thinking-connection&quot; that is characteristic of the 2C-T group is evident in this chemical in stark contrast to the &quot;pure euphoria&quot; of phenethylamines such as MDMA.

==Legality==
2C-T-8 is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-T-8 will probably be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-T-7. However, 2C-T-8, unlike many other phenethylamines has not been sold by internet retailers. In the wake of Operation Web Tryp in July 2004, the issue of possession and sales of 2C-T-8 and other similar chemicals will probably be resolved in the courtroom as will the fate of this rare but unique psychedelic.

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-8 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

==Pharmacology==

The mechanism that produces 2C-T-8&#x27;s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known.

==Dangers==
The toxicity of 2C-T-8 is not well documented. 2C-T-8 is somewhat less potent than 2C-T-7, but it may be expected that at higher doses it would display similar toxicity to that of other phenethylamines of the 2C-T family.

There have been no confirmed deaths due to 2C-T-8, though this may in part be due to its rarity and limited usage. Of the 2C-T family, there have been a few confirmed deaths due to 2C-T-7, which involved either insufflating large (&gt;30 mg) doses and in one case an unknown oral dose was combined with 200 mg MDMA.

==Popularity==
2C-T-8 is unknown on the black market. Limited accounts of 2C-T-8 can be found in the book PiHKAL.

<text>The Madre de Dios River () is a river shared by Bolivia and Peru which is homonymous to the Peruvian region it runs through. On Bolivian territory, it receives the Beni River, close to the town of Riberalta, which later joins with the Mamore River to become the Madeira River after the confluence. The Madeira is a tributary to the Amazon River.

The Madre de Dios is an important waterway for the department of Madre de Dios, particularly Puerto Maldonado, the largest town in the area, and the capital of the department. Mango farming and gold mining are among the many industries on its banks. Other important industries the Madre de Dios provides are selective logging and farming, both of which are serious environmental problems. Along the length of the river, there are several national parks and reserves, notably Tambopata-Candamo National Park, Manu National Park (also known as Manu Biosphere Reserve) and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park.

==Hydrography==
The Madre de Dios serves as the largest watershed in the area, as part of the vast Amazon River watershed. The river&#x27;s main tributaries include on the right: Chivile, Azul, Blanco, Inambari, Tambopata and Colorado rivers and from the left: Los Amigos, Manu, and Las Piedras.

<text>Wallace is the remains of a lunar impact crater that has been flooded by lava. It was named after British natural historian Alfred Russel Wallace. It lies in the southeastern part of Mare Imbrium, northeast of the crater Eratosthenes. The crater rim forms a somewhat polygonal outline, and is broken in the southeast. The floor is flat and devoid of significant features, but it is overlain by ray material from Copernicus to the southwest. The rim ascends to an altitude of 0.4 km above the lunar mare.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint closest to Wallace.
The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Wallace B — &quot;See&quot; Huxley (lunar crater).

<doc id="955417" wikidata="Q8024152" url="?curid=955417" title="Windfall Records">
<text>Windfall Records was a record label founded in 1969 by Bud Prager and Felix Pappalardi to distribute records of acts they managed and/or produced. Singer-guitarist Leslie West recorded for Windfall throughout the label&#x27;s existence, initially as a solo artist (1969) and subsequently with the bands Mountain (1970–72 and 1973–74) and West, Bruce and Laing (1972–73).

Windfall was first distributed by Bell Records, who handled their releases through mid-1972. The label then transferred distribution to Columbia Records (now a sister label to Bell&#x27;s successor Arista Records, which was folded into RCA Records in 2011) as part of Columbia&#x27;s signing of West, Bruce and Laing. When WBL dissolved in 1973, Mountain re-formed and distributed their releases through Windfall/Columbia. Windfall folded in 1974, following Mountain&#x27;s breakup.

<text>Petoro is a company that is wholly owned by the Government of Norway. Established in 2001, it manages the Government&#x27;s portfolio—collectively called State&#x27;s Direct Financial Interest (SDFI)—of exploration and production licenses for petroleum and natural gas on the Norwegian continental shelf. The company also has a control function surveying Equinor&#x27;s production on behalf of the Government. Petoro is not an operator of any fields and does not directly own the licenses.

In 2021, Petoro was ranked no. 33 out of 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle in the Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI).

<doc id="955434" wikidata="Q161948" url="?curid=955434" title="Gypsophila">
<text>Gypsophila () is a genus of flowering plants in the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. They are native to Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Turkey has a particularly high diversity of &quot;Gypsophila&quot; taxa, with about 35 endemic species. Some &quot;Gypsophila&quot; are introduced species in other regions.

The genus name is from the Greek &quot;gypsos&quot; (&quot;gypsum&quot;) and &quot;philios&quot; (&quot;loving&quot;), a reference to the gypsum-rich substrates on which some species grow. Plants of the genus are known commonly as baby&#x27;s-breath, or bebe&#x27;s breath, a name which also refers specifically to the well known ornamental species &quot;Gypsophila paniculata&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Gypsophila&quot; is one of the most heterogeneous and largest groups in the carnation tribe, Caryophylleae. The genus comprises approximately 150 species of annual or perennial herbaceous, creeping or cushion-forming plants, inhabiting primarily the mountainous steppes in the north temperate part of the Old World with a diversification hotspot in the Irano-Turanian region. These species also show major variation in inflorescence type ranging from many-flowered lax thyrses or panicles (e.g., &quot;G. elegans&quot; M.Bieb., &quot;G. paniculata&quot; L., &quot;G. pilosa&quot; Huds.) to compact head-like cymes ( &quot;G. capitata&quot; M.Bieb., &quot;G. capituliflora&quot; Rupr., &quot;G. caricifolia Boiss&quot;.), and few-(uni-)flowered raceme-like monochasia (e.g., &quot;G. bazorganica&quot; Rech.f., &quot;G. saponarioides&quot; Bornm. &amp; Gauba). Each small flower has a cup-like calyx of white-edged green sepals containing five petals in shades of white or pink. The fruit is a rounded or oval capsule opening at valves. It contains several brown or black seeds which are often shaped like a kidney or a snail shell.

==Uses==
A few species are commercially cultivated for several uses, including floristry, herbal medicine, and food. The baby&#x27;s-breath most commonly used in flower arrangements such as bouquets is the common gypsophila, &quot;G. paniculata&quot;. &quot;G. elegans&quot; is also used as a cut flower.

The genus is a source of saponins that can be used for many purposes, including the production of photographic film and hemolytic laboratory reagents. Their detergent qualities make them useful in soap and shampoo.

&quot;G. rokejeka&quot; is used to make the dessert halva. Species are also ingredients in liqueur, cheese, and ice cream, providing flavor, aroma, and crispness to foods.

Several species are hyperaccumulators of boron, and may be planted to absorb the element from polluted soils.

==Ecology==
Some species are known as weeds, including the &quot;aggressive ornamental&quot; &quot;G. paniculata&quot;, which invades habitat and competes with native flora.

The plant Çöven, &quot;G. simonii&quot; is widely distributed throughout Çankırı, where it is a native species, and Turkey. In this study, chemical and physical properties of unripe saponins obtained by extraction from the roots of &quot;G. simonii&quot;, an endemic plant, were isolated and investigated. Purified aglycones recovered from acid hydrolysis of the saponins were separated by reversed chromatography on a thin layer of silica gel. Phytochemical tests showed the presence of terpenoids in the crude extracts.

==Selected species==
There are about 150 species in the genus.

Species include:

*&quot;Gypsophila acutifolia&quot; – sharpleaf baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila arrostii&quot; – Arrost&#x27;s baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila elegans&quot; – showy baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila fastigiata&quot; – fastigiate gypsophila
*&quot;Gypsophila litwinowii&quot;
*&quot;Gypsophila nana&quot; – dwarf gypsophila
*&quot;Gypsophila oldhamiana&quot; – Manchurian baby&#x27;s-breath, Oldham&#x27;s baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila paniculata&quot; – baby&#x27;s-breath, common gypsophila, panicled baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila perfoliata&quot; – perfoliate gypsophila
*&quot;Gypsophila petraea&quot;
*&quot;Gypsophila pilosa&quot; – Turkish baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila repens&quot; – alpine gypsophila, creeping baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila scorzonerifolia&quot; – glandular baby&#x27;s-breath, garden baby&#x27;s-breath
*&quot;Gypsophila spinosa&quot;
*&quot;Gypsophila stevenii&quot; – Steven&#x27;s baby&#x27;s-breath
&quot;Gypsophila muralis&quot; (annual gypsophila, cushion baby&#x27;s-breath, low baby&#x27;s-breath) is now placed in the genus &quot;Psammophiliella&quot;.

<text>Robert Emmet Hagan (March 22, 1921 – January 17, 1999) was an American politician of the Democratic Party.

Hagan was an ironworker in Youngstown and served as a county commissioner in Trumbull County, Ohio, before being elected to the Ohio General Assembly in the district of his adopted hometown of Madison, Ohio. During his three terms in the legislature, 1983–1989, he was known as the assembly&#x27;s most liberal member. During that period, Hagan&#x27;s son, Robert F. Hagan, also held a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives.

In 1970, Hagan ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. In 1972, Hagan was on the traveling staff of Democratic nominee for Vice President Sargent Shriver as his joke writer.

Throughout his career Hagan was known for a forceful speaking style that often included a fair share of humor. After leaving elected office, Hagan began performing stand-up comedy, having fun with politics and the unusually large size of his family (he and his wife, Ada DiLoreto Hagan, had 14 children), among other topics. He continued to perform into his mid 70s. He also wrote a number of op-eds for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;.

Hagan&#x27;s son Timothy Hagan was a county commissioner in Cuyahoga County, Ohio for 16 years, and was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Ohio in 2002 and was once-again elected Cuyahoga County Commissioner in 2004.

His other son, Robert F. Hagan, served in the Ohio House of Representatives and the Ohio Senate.

<text>Marvel Mystery Comics (first issue titled simply Marvel Comics) is an American comic book series published during the 1930s–1940s period known to fans and historians as the Golden Age of Comic Books. It was the first publication of Marvel Comics&#x27; predecessor, Timely Comics, a division of Timely Publications.

In 1949, with the popularity of superheroes having waned, the book was converted into the horror anthology Marvel Tales from issue #93–159 (Aug. 1949 – Aug. 1957), when it ceased publication. 

==Publication history==
===Premiere issue: &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1===
In 1939, pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman expanded into the newly emerging comic book field by buying content from comics packager Funnies, Inc.

On August 31, 1939, his first effort, &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated Oct. 1939), from his company Timely Publications, was published. This featured the first appearances of writer-artist Carl Burgos&#x27; android superhero the Human Torch, Paul Gustavson&#x27;s costumed detective the Angel, and the first generally available appearance of Bill Everett&#x27;s mutant anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner. The Sub-Mariner was created for the unpublished movie-theater giveaway comic &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; earlier that year, with the eight-page original story now expanded by four pages. Also included were Al Anders&#x27; Western hero the Masked Raider (Jim Gardley), canceled after appearing in the first twelve issues; the jungle lord feature &quot;The Adventures of Ka-Zar the Great&quot;, with Ben Thompson beginning a five-issue adaptation of the story &quot;King of Fang and Claw&quot; by Bob Byrd (pseudonym of Martin Goodman) in Goodman&#x27;s pulp magazine &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; #1 (Oct. 1936); the non-continuing-character story &quot;Jungle Terror&quot;, featuring an adventurer named Ken Masters and Professor John Roberts, written by the quirkily named Tohm Dixon; &quot;Now I&#x27;ll Tell One&quot;, five single-panel, black-and-white gag cartoons by Fred Schwab, on the inside front cover; and &quot;Burning Rubber&quot;, a two-page prose story by Ray Gill about auto racing. A painted cover by veteran science fiction pulp artist Frank R. Paul featured the Human Torch, looking much different than in the interior story.

That initial magazine quickly sold out 80,000 copies, prompting Goodman to produce a second printing, cover-dated November 1939 and identical except for a black bar in the inside-front-cover indicia over the October date and the November date added at the end. That sold approximately 800,000 copies. With a hit on his hands, Goodman began assembling an in-house staff, hiring Funnies, Inc. writer-artist Joe Simon as editor. Simon brought along his collaborator, artist Jack Kirby, followed by artist Syd Shores.

===As &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot;===
The Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner would continue to star in the long-running title even after receiving their own solo comic-book series shortly afterward. The Angel, who was featured on the covers of issues #2–3, would appear in every issue through #79 (Dec. 1946).

Other characters introduced in the title include the aviator the American Ace (#2, Dec. 1939), with part one of his origin reprinted, like the first part of the Sub-Mariner&#x27;s, from &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; #1; the private detective the Ferret (Leslie Lenrow) by writer Stockbridge Winslow and artist Irwin Hasen (issues 4-9, February 1940-July 1940); and writer-artist Steve Dahlman&#x27;s robot hero Electro, the Marvel of the Age (appearing in every issue from #4–19, Feb. 1940 – May 1941). Issue #13 saw the first appearance of the Vision, the inspiration for the same-name Marvel Comics superhero created in 1968. The original Vision appeared in solo stories through &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #48. Also featured in the title was Terry Vance, The School Boy Sleuth by Ray Gill and Bob Oksner (debuting in issue #10, August 1940 until #57, July 1944, as well as appearing in the first two issues of the revived &quot;Mystic Comics&quot; shortly thereafter).

=== &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; (1949–1957) ===

The first &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; was the direct continuation of the superhero anthology &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot;, published by Marvel Comics&#x27; initial iteration, Timely Comics. This series ran through issue #92 (cover-dated June 1949). Beginning with issue #93 (Aug. 1949), it became &quot;Marvel Tales&quot;, an anthology of horror, fantasy, and science fiction stories. The bulk of this series was published under the company name Atlas Comics.

&quot;Marvel Tales&quot; included among its contributors writer and editor-in-chief Stan Lee and such comics artists as Golden Age veterans Harry Anderson, Carl Burgos, Bill Everett, Fred Kida, Mike Sekowsky, Syd Shores, and Ogden Whitney, and, early in their careers, Dick Ayers, Gene Colan, Tony DiPreta, Mort Drucker, Russ Heath, Bernard Krigstein, Joe Maneely, Joe Sinnott, and Basil Wolverton, among others. Issue #147 featured one of Steve Ditko&#x27;s first stories for Marvel, &quot;The Vanishing Martians&quot;. The series ran 67 issues under the new title, through #159 (Aug. 1957). It ended because of the collapse of Atlas&#x27;s distributor, American News Company, and the subsequent restructuring that limited the number of comics the company could publish in a month.

An issue of &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; was included in a display of covers representative of the &quot;Crime, Horror &amp; Weird Variety&quot; at the April 1954 hearings of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency.

Marvel published a different series of the same name in the 1960s, primarily reprinting Spider-Man stories.

<doc id="955461" wikidata="Q7758727" url="?curid=955461" title="Hits Radio West Yorkshire">
<text>Hits Radio West Yorkshire, formerly Pulse 1, is an Independent Local Radio station based in Leeds, England, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to West Yorkshire.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 170,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==

The station originally launched in 1975 as a Bradford-based service called Pennine Radio.

===Pennine Radio===
In 1984, the station won the licence for the neighbouring West Yorkshire areas of Kirklees and Calderdale and in December of that year the station began broadcasting to all of the western half of the county. 

In 1987, the station was part of the Yorkshire Radio Network which also owned Viking FM and Hallam FM, and the following year saw the station&#x27;s MW frequencies start to be used for a Yorkshire-wide station called Classic Gold. The FM service was renamed to Pennine FM. Yorkshire Radio Network was bought out by Newcastle based Metro Radio Group (owners of Metro Radio and TFM). Pennine Radio became Pennine FM in the late 1980s when the AM frequency was split off to create the original incarnation of Classic Gold.

===The Pulse/Pulse 1===
On 30 August 1991, Pennine FM was rebranded as &quot;The Pulse&quot; in a bid to revive flagging fortunes.

The Metro Radio Group itself was bought out by EMAP in 1996 and ownership rules at the time meant that as they already owned neighbouring Radio Aire in Leeds something had to be sold on, and that was The Pulse and its sister station Classic Gold which were purchased in a management buyout from senior staff and ex-Metro Group executives. The new company was called The Radio Partnership, it was at this time that the station moved to number one position in the West Yorkshire radio market for the first time in its history.

The Radio Partnership expanded over the years to include other stations, such as Signal Radio in Stoke-on-Trent. In 1999, Kelvin MacKenzie&#x27;s Talk Radio UK bought The Radio Partnership and formed The Wireless Group to include the national broadcaster and a series of local stations. In July 2005 The Wireless Group was bought out by UTV Group. In September 2016, The Wireless Group was purchased by News UK.

On 8 February 2019, Pulse 1 and the Wireless Group&#x27;s network of local radio stations were sold to Bauer.

In May 2020, Bauer announced that Pulse 1 would join the Hits Radio network, while retaining its on-air branding. Pulse 1 began carrying off-peak programming from the Hits Radio network on 15 June 2020 and the station officially joined the Hits Radio network on 20 July 2020.

In September 2020, Pulse 1 began broadcasting to the eastern part of West Yorkshire on DAB following the closure of sister station Radio Aire.

In March 2021, Bauer closed Pulse 1&#x27;s Bradford studios and moved the station to the former Radio Aire studios in Leeds, co-locating with Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire.

===Hits Radio rebrand===
On 10 January 2024, station owners Bauer announced Pulse 1 would be rebranded as Hits Radio West Yorkshire as part of a network-wide relaunch involving 17 local radio stations in England and Wales.

The name was changed on 17 April 2024, however the station’s local programming was not affected as a result of the relaunch.

==Service area==
The main 102.5 FM signal comes from the Vicars Lot transmitter close to the M62 between Scammonden Dam and junction 23, close to the Scammonden arched bridge. This signal covers most of West Yorkshire, including eastern areas of the county such as Leeds, Wakefield, Castleford, Pontefract and Knottingley.

It can be heard as far south as Doncaster and Sheffield, and also to the west of the Pennines in Lancashire and Greater Manchester. The signal is much stronger, and the transmitter at a higher altitude than the Idle transmitter.

The 97.5 FM signal covers Bradford, and comes from the Idle transmitter, which is on the top of Idle Moor, between Idle and Shipley. The Idle transmitter also carries national radio frequencies, Capital Yorkshire on 105.6 FM, Sunrise Radio Yorkshire on 103.2 FM and Heart Yorkshire on 107.6 FM.

==Programming== 
Networked programming originates from Bauer&#x27;s London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Newcastle studios.

Local programming is produced and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Leeds studios each weekday from 6–10 am for &quot;The Hits Radio Breakfast Show With Mylo &amp; Rosie&quot;.

===News===
Bauer&#x27;s Leeds newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6 am–7 pm on weekdays and from 7 am–1 pm on weekends. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows. The station simulcasts hourly Sky News Radio bulletins at all other times.

====Former sport programming====
Pulse 1 aired extensive local sports coverage, including live match commentaries on Bradford City matches, led by Jason Thornton and former City striker Ian Ormondroyd, and a weekly rugby league magazine show, presented by Bradford Bulls CEO Robbie Hunter Paul.

<text>The State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), originally known as the State Earnings Related Pension Supplement, was a UK Government pension arrangement, to which employees and employers contributed between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 2002, when it was replaced by the State Second Pension. 

Employees who paid full Class 1 National insurance contribution between 1978 and 2002 earned a SERPS pension. Members of occupational pension schemes could be &quot;contracted out&quot; of SERPS by their employer, in which case they and the employer would pay reduced NI contributions, and they would earn virtually no SERPS pension.

==General principle==

The purpose of the scheme was to provide a pension related to earnings, in addition to the basic state pension.

The principle was that everyone would receive a SERPS pension of 25 per cent of their earnings above a &quot;lower earning limit&quot; (approximating to the amount of the basic state pension). The scheme was phased in over twenty years so that those retiring before 1998 received a SERPS pension proportional to the number of years that they had made contributions to it. There was an &quot;upper earning limit&quot; of about seven times the lower earning limit, beyond which earnings were disregarded for NI contributions and calculation of SERPS pensions. 

Under the Social Security Act 1986 the target SERPS pension was reduced from twenty five to twenty per cent of average earnings between the two limits. Pensions earned before 6 April 1988 were not reduced and the change was to be phased in for people retiring between 1999 and 2009.

==Detailed calculations==

* The pension earned is calculated by taking the earnings between the lower earning limit and the upper earning limit in each tax year. This amount is referred to as ‘surplus earnings’. 
* These ‘surplus earnings’ are then increased in line with national average earnings until the individual reaches state pension age.
* The earnings between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 1988 are then divided by 4 (to achieve the target of 25 per cent of earnings).
* The earnings between 6 April 1988 and 5 April 2002 are multiplied by a factor depending on the tax year state pension age is reached:

* The combined amount is divided by the number of complete tax years between April 1978 (or the first year in which the individual paid NI contributions if later) and the tax year the individual reaches state pension age.

==Contracting out==

When the scheme was established, employers with final-salary pension schemes could choose to contract-out of SERPS, provided they gave scheme members a Guaranteed Minimum Pension. In return for opting out of SERPS the employer would pay reduced National Insurance contributions. 

In 1988 members of money purchase pension schemes were allowed to opt out for the first time. Instead of providing a Guaranteed Minimum Pension these schemes had to pay the saving in National Insurance contributions into the pension arrangement. To encourage the take-up of this arrangement the government made an extra incentive payment into each pension scheme where somebody contracted out using this route.

According to the Financial Services Authority, many policy holders who contracted out of the state pension may have been victims of SERPs Pension Mis-selling and lost funds that deserve compensation. Hence an investigation was launched to investigate the claims that millions of employees had been led astray with the advice to contract out of SERPS.

As the government began to question the long-term affordability of the SERPS, they offered incentives to encourage people to opt out of the SERPS into an Appropriate Personal Pension (APP). The rebates offered by the government as incentives to opting out have since been cut, causing many to question whether it was misleading to encourage people to opt out, as many are now being advised to opt back in.

Ultimately, investigations have shown that mis-sold pension affected some, but not others. For some, returning to the state pension is a favorable option, but for others in different financial circumstances and with different financial needs, the APP option is also beneficial.

==After 2002==

In April 2002 SERPS accrual ended and was replaced by the State Second Pension. The main reason for the change was to provide a larger pension to people of low earnings.

From April 2016 the old Basic State Pension plus Additional State Pension (SERPS, State Second Pension and Graduated Retirement Benefit) were replaced by the New State Pension.

<text>Valleys Radio (Welsh: Radio&#x27;r Cymoedd) was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the heads of the South Wales Valleys. The broadcast area was covered by two transmitters, 999 kHz from the Aberdare transmitter, and 1116 kHz from the Ebbw Vale transmitter, with the Ebbw Vale signal being the comparatively stronger of the two.

==History==
Owners Wireless Group were offered FM frequencies for The Heads of the Valleys they wanted to share programming with neighbouring service Swansea Sound and relocate Swansea Sound to a new media centre in Neath. Wireless applied to extend Swansea Sound West as well and applied for a licence to broadcast from transmitters in Carmarthenshire at Llanelli Carmel and Carmarthen. But due to ownership rules the applications were refused by Ofcom. FM transmissions were not initiated in the area.

On 20 March 2009, UTV Radio announced Valleys Radio was to be sold or shut down within the next 4 weeks. On Thursday 30 April 2009 at 10am, Valleys Radio ceased transmitting, after many listener messages, emotional speeches and farewells from radio producers and presenters. The final song aired was &quot;Our last song together&quot; by Neil Sedaka, on the final radio show, which was called &quot;Mark Powell @ Breakfast&quot;.

== Presenters/Producers (over the years) ==
These included Gareth Williams, Karen Brown, Bernie Keith, Dafydd Phillips, Steve Powell, Patrick Downes, Tony Peters, Mark Powell, John Curtis, Keri Jones, Simon Hawkins, Jo Price, Dave Bowen, Steve Johnson, Mike Parker.

== Music ==
The station mainly featured a strong variety of current and classic hits. The station also ran an online &#x27;Music Academy&#x27; which allowed listeners to feedback on the music played by the station via the Valleys Radio website.

==Sister Stations==
Two sister stations, Swansea Sound (Now Greatest Hits Radio South Wales) and The Wave - which broadcast to the Swansea area are still active. Some previous and current presenters from these two stations have broadcast on Valleys Radio.

<text>USS &quot;Taylor&quot; (DD-94) was a built in 1918 for the United States Navy, which saw service in World War I and the years following. She was named for Rear Admiral Henry Taylor.

One of 111 ships of her class, &quot;Taylor&quot; was commissioned near the end of World War I and patrolled in the Atlantic Ocean during and immediately following the war, though she saw no service supporting the war. After eight years out of commission, she returned to service in 1930 patrolling along the East Coast of the United States and in Latin America. Decommissioned in 1938, she then became a training hulk. During World War II her forward section was removed and grafted onto after the latter ship was damaged in a submarine attack. &quot;Taylor&quot; continued to serve as a training hulk until she was sold for scrap in 1945.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Taylor&quot; was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with seven of her sisters, were constructed at Mare Island Navy Yard in San Francisco, California, using detailed designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works.

She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was armed with four 4&quot;/50 caliber guns, one 3&quot;/23 caliber gun, and twelve torpedo tubes for torpedoes. She had a regular crew complement of 122 officers and enlisted men. with an indicated horsepower of .

Specifics on &quot;Taylor&quot;″s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers known unofficially as the &#x27;Liberty Type&#x27; to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered from poor maneuverability and were overweight.

She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named USS &quot;Taylor&quot;, commemorating Navy admiral Henry Clay Taylor. A second would be commissioned in 1942, a named for William Rogers Taylor. That ship saw extensive service in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.

==History==
&quot;Taylor&quot; was laid down as Destroyer No. 94 on 15 October 1917 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, and launched on 14 February 1918. She was commissioned on 1 June 1918, sponsored by Ms. Mary Gorgas.

Upon commissioning, &quot;Taylor&quot; joined Destroyer Division 12 of the Atlantic Fleet. She cruised with that fleet during World War I but saw no action. Following the war on 1 April 1919, she was assigned to Destroyer Division 8. In 1920, &quot;Taylor&quot; was placed in reduced commission though still operating on the Atlantic coast. That summer, on 17 July, the Navy adopted the alpha-numeric hull designation system, and &quot;Taylor&quot; became DD-94. In October, she was placed back in full commission and, until the summer of 1922, operated with Destroyer Division 8, Flotilla 8, Squadron 3. On 21 June 1922, the ship was placed out of commission at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

&quot;Taylor&quot; remained inactive there until 1 May 1930, when she was placed back in commission under the command of Commander George B. Keester. She was assigned to Destroyer Division 33, Squadron 7, which was part of the Scouting Fleet. During this time, she operated from Charleston, South Carolina, until November when she was placed in reduced commission once again. At the same time, &quot;Taylor&quot; was detached from the Scouting Fleet and transferred to Destroyer Division 47, Squadron 16 of the Training Squadron. She was assigned to the 6th and 7th Naval Districts to train reservists and to carry Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipmen on summer cruises. By 1 April 1931, Scouting Fleet became Scouting Force, and the destroyer was reassigned as an element of Division 28 of the Training Squadron. She operated with that unit until early in 1934 when she joined Squadron 19 of the rotating reserve with which she remained until late 1931.

On 1 September, she relieved the destroyer on duty with the Special Service Squadron. She patrolled the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico with that force for one year due to instability in Latin America. By 1 October 1935, &quot;Taylor&quot; was back with the Training Squadron as a unit of the newly established Division 30. She trained reservists until early in 1937 when she returned to the Special Service Squadron in relief of the destroyer . She returned to patrols in the Caribbean area. Returning to the United States in 1938, &quot;Taylor&quot; was moored at Philadelphia to prepare for inactivation. The destroyer was placed out of commission on 23 September 1938. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 December 1938, and she was offered for sale in July 1939. However, on 11 July 1940, she was redesignated Damage Control Hulk No. 40 and tasked to train damage control parties.

On 25 May 1942, sister ship was struck by a torpedo fired from while patrolling off Martinique. The torpedo struck between frames 18 and 24 at about below &quot;Blakeley&quot;″s water line, and the force of the impact blew off of her bow and forecastle. Sailing under her own power to Philadelphia Naval Yard, &quot;Blakeley&quot; had the forward 60 feet of &quot;Taylor&quot;″s hull grafted onto her throughout the summer of 1942. This was completed in September 1942, and &quot;Blakeley&quot;, with &quot;Taylor&quot;″s forward hull, served through the remainder of the war. The remaining of &quot;Taylor&quot; spent the remainder of World War II in her duties as a training hulk. She was sold for scrap in 1945, and delivered on 8 August.

<doc id="955481" wikidata="Q15265781" url="?curid=955481" title="Peak FM (North Derbyshire)">
<text>Peak FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving north Derbyshire. The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==Coverage area==
Peak FM&#x27;s coverage area included the towns of Alfreton, Bakewell, Bolsover, Clay Cross, Dronfield, Matlock, Pinxton, Ripley, Shirebrook, South Normanton and Staveley. Southern districts of the City of Sheffield were also included, though the topography of the area made reception unreliable in certain parts.

===Frequencies===
* 107.4 FM covered Chesterfield, south Sheffield, north Alfreton, and north-eastern Derbyshire,from the Chesterfield transmitter at Unstone.
* 102.0 FM covered Matlock, Bakewell, the Derbyshire Dales and central Alfreton from the Stanton Moor transmitter.

Peak FM was also available as an audio stream on the internet.

==History==
The station began broadcasting to Chesterfield as Peak 107 FM on 7 October 1998, at 08:00, with the Simple Minds song &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;. The Radio Authority had awarded Grand Central Broadcasting the licence earlier in the spring.

The station was launched by Dave Kilner, with the (then) Mayor and Mayoress of Chesterfield. Mark Burrows presented Breakfast after the launch, followed by Dave Kilner on mid-mornings, James Hilton on drive, Trev Parsons one hour of drive and the evening show and Richard Spinks on &quot;Late Night Love&quot;.

At the same time, the authority also awarded licences for two other small stations, in nearby Bassetlaw and Mansfield.

===Forever Broadcasting===
In 2001, Forever Broadcasting bought Grand Central Broadcasting and Peak 107 was rebranded with &quot;The 50/50 Music Mix of Yesterday and Today&quot;, tagline, accompanying change in music policy.

Forever sold three of its stations in 2003: with three remaining- Peak, Tower FM in Bolton and Wolverhampton&#x27;s 107.7 The Wolf.
In early 2004, Forever Broadcasting was itself bought by The Wireless Group, run by former newspaper editor Kelvin MacKenzie.

===Wireless Group and UTV Radio===

Under the new regime, the station&#x27;s name changed from &#x27;Peak 107&#x27; to &#x27;Peak FM&#x27; in Summer 2004. The station had always broadcast on two frequencies.

Station output did not change dramatically after the takeover, but presenters were occasionally required to promote other stations and services offered by The Wireless Group, which was itself taken over by UTV Radio in June 2005.

===Bauer===
On 8 February 2019, the Wireless Group&#x27;s local radio stations (including Peak FM) were sold to Bauer.

The sale was ratified in March 2020, following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority, and on 27 May 2020, Bauer announced Peak FM would become part of the Greatest Hits Radio network.

On 13 July 2020, local programming excluding breakfast was replaced by networked output from GHR, resulting in redundancies among most of the presentation team.

In September 2020, Peak FM ended its local breakfast show and closed its Chesterfield studios as it completed rebranding to Greatest Hits Radio. The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, which until November 2024 provided a regional afternoon show from Bauer&#x27;s Leeds studios. Thereafter all programmes were networked, primarily from London or Manchester. However, localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising have been retained.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio Bolton &amp; Bury (formerly Tower FM) is an Independent Local Radio station serving the Bolton and Bury areas of Greater Manchester.

Following its sale to Bauer Radio, the station was closed and merged with the Greatest Hits Radio network in September 2020.

==Overview==
The radio station was given the name &quot;Tower&quot; as a local link to both towns in the station&#x27;s coverage area; Turton Tower near to Bolton and Peel Tower on Holcombe Hill at Ramsbottom near Bury.

Originally an RSL (restricted service licence) radio station, the team behind the project won the full-time licence and the station began broadcasting on 20 March 1999.

As an RSL, Tower FM broadcast from Bury via a link to the transmitter on Peel Tower. The station later moved to Bolton once the main base was established on Gaskell Street.

Both towns served as the main target service area for the station, although it could also be heard in most of Greater Manchester and even parts of Cheshire.

In early 2007, the station&#x27;s then-owners approached UK media regulator OFCOM to ask permission to move the station&#x27;s base from Bolton to the Haydock or Newton Le Willows area of Merseyside as part of a plan to co-locate Tower with two other stations from the UTV Media group - Wish FM in Wigan and Wire FM in Warrington.

The original plan was abandoned but from the autumn of 2009, all three stations were based at studios in the Orrell area of Wigan.

==Station rebrand==
On 8 February 2019, Tower FM and the Wireless Group&#x27;s local radio stations were sold to Bauer Radio. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 27 May 2020, it was announced that Tower FM will join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network.

On 13 July 2020, local programming outside weekday breakfast was replaced by networked output from the GHR network, with Tower FM retaining its own branding.

In September 2020, Tower FM merged with several local stations in the North West of England and North Wales, as Greatest Hits Radio North West. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained. The station&#x27;s Orrell studios were closed.

<text>Wave FM was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the cities of Dundee and Perth in Scotland.

The station broadcast a mixed music format 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and was founded as part of The Petros Radio Group which launched Discovery AM in 1994 and Radio Waves in 1995, followed by the award of a full scale ILR licence with the help of a consortium which also founded Kingdom FM in Fife with the assistance of IRG (The Independent Radio Group)

When the station originally launched it was called Discovery 102, since Dundee is known as the City of Discovery after the RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;, which is docked there. The brand name was changed to Wave 102 after The Discovery Channel stated that people would mistakenly associate the station with its network.

On 15 May 2008, New Wave Media became the new owners of Wave 102, which was eventually joined by sister stations Original 106 in Aberdeen and Central FM in the Forth Valley.

On 26 October 2016, Ofcom approved an application from Wave 102 and Heartland FM to allow Wave 102 to take over the 106.6FM transmitter covering Perth. On Monday 9 January 2017 the station started to brand itself as &#x27;Dundee and Perth&#x27;s Wave 102&#x27;.

On 1 December 2016, three online-only stations were launched under the Wave 102 brand; Wave 102 Chart (playing non-stop hits), Wave 102 Country (24 hour current and classic country hits) and Wave 102 Gold (non-stop 60&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s hits).

In December 2017, it was announced that Dundee based DC Thomson had acquired the licences to broadcast to Dundee and Perth from New Wave Media.

On 19 March 2018, Wave 102 relaunched as Wave FM at 6am.

Wave FM ceased broadcasting in July 2020 and was replaced by a relay of DC Thomson&#x27;s central-belt DAB station Pure Radio, with opt-outs for local news and traffic bulletins.

On 12 September 2023, Pure Radio ceased broadcasting, with its FM frequencies in Dundee and Perth subsequently handed over to Original 106.

==Influence==
Rockstar North, the Dundee founded game developer of the Grand Theft Auto series, added Scottish and Dundee sound and visual references in the game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one being an in-game radio station called Wave 103.

<text>Radio Wave was an Independent Local Radio station serving Blackpool, The Fylde and surrounding areas. It broadcast from studios in the Layton area of Blackpool via a specially constructed transmitter atop Blackpool Tower.

Following its sale to Bauer Radio, the station was closed and merged with the Greatest Hits Radio network in September 2020.

== History ==

In the late 1980s, local businessman John Barnett started lobbying the radio industry regulator for a distinct Independent Local Radio (ILR) licence for the Blackpool and Fylde area. The licence was awarded in 1992 and Radio Wave began broadcasting at 7 am on 25 May 1992 with an introduction from its founder. The first presenter on-air was Neil Sexton and the first record played was &quot;The Best&quot; by Tina Turner. The official launch took place on a specially erected stage in front of a live audience on the promenade by Blackpool Tower and featured Les Dawson and Derek Batey, together with other local celebrities.

In its first year of broadcasting, the station won a Sony Radio Academy Awards &quot;Gold Award&quot; and was commended in the &quot;Local Station of the Year&quot; category.

In August 1996, Radio Wave was confirmed by RAJAR as the most listened-to radio station in the area, ahead of fourteen other stations which were available including BBC Radio 1, which had half the number of listeners locally. In 2000, John Barnett received an MBE for services to radio broadcasting. He later became the station&#x27;s chairman.

== Transmission area ==
Radio Wave&#x27;s studios were based on Mowbray Drive in the Layton area of Blackpool, with the signal coming from the top of the Blackpool Tower.

The station could be heard from Fleetwood in the Wyre district, in the northwest corner of the Fylde, Preston to the east and Southport, west-southwest of Preston. Radio Wave could also be received as far north as Shap Fell in Cumbria.

==Station rebrand==
On 8 February 2019, Radio Wave and the Wireless Group&#x27;s local radio stations were sold to Bauer Radio. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 27 May 2020, it was announced that Radio Wave will join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network.

On 13 July 2020, local programming outside weekday breakfast was replaced by networked output from the GHR network, with Radio Wave retaining its own branding.

On 1 September 2020, the station merged with six local stations in the North West of England and North Wales, forming Greatest Hits Radio North West. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was dropped and replaced by a regional afternoon show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising are retained as opt-outs. The station&#x27;s Blackpool studios were closed.

==New Local Radio Stations on DAB==
On 1 September 2022, a new DAB+ transmitter was launched which is located at the same broadcast location as Radio Wave (Blackpool Tower) This new transmitter launched with two new digital radio stations aimed at Blackpool, these stations were (as of launch day):

*106.5 Central Radio
*Sandgrounder Radio
*Happy Radio

<text>The Controllers are a fictional extraterrestrial race existing in the DC Universe. They first appear in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #357 (June 1967), and were created by Jim Shooter, Mort Weisinger, and Curt Swan.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
In their initial appearance, the Controllers originate from another dimension that was ravaged by war and seek to protect the main universe from the same fate. They use their mind-control abilities to prevent intergalactic war, but also create powerful weapons, including the Sun-Eaters, gaseous beings that can devour whole planets and stars; and the Miracle Machine, a device that can turn any thought into reality. In some depictions, the Time Trapper is a renegade Controller.

===Maltusians===
In post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity, the Controllers are part of the Guardians of the Universe before separating from them due to their differing morals. Additionally, they create the Darkstars, an intergalactic peacekeeping force, and experiment on Martyn Van Wyck, transforming him into Effigy.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Larfleeze kills several Controllers and assimilates them into the Orange Lantern Corps.

===DC Rebirth===
In the DC Rebirth relaunch, the Controllers are on the brink of extinction, and kidnap the Guardians of the Universe to transform them into Controllers.

==Powers and weapons==
Similar to the Guardians of the Universe, the Controllers are immortal and possess psionic powers, including telepathy, telekinesis, and energy manipulation. The Controllers also have vast knowledge, which allows them to create advanced technology and weapons. Their most known weapons are the Sun-Eater, Miracle Machine, and the Darkstar exo-mantle.

==In other media==
===Television===
* A Controller appears in the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; two-part episode &quot;Sundown&quot;, voiced by David Lodge.
* The Controllers make a cameo appearance in the teaser of the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;When OMAC Attacks!&quot;.

===Video games===
A Controller appears in &quot;Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters&quot;.

<text>Pulse 2 was an Independent Local Radio station serving Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale areas from studios in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England.

The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==Background==
The station was previously known as Pennine Radio, Classic Gold, Great Yorkshire Gold, Great Yorkshire Radio, 1278 and 1530 AM West Yorkshire, West Yorkshire&#x27;s Big AM, Pennine&#x27;s Big AM, West Yorkshire&#x27;s Classic Gold and Pulse Classic Gold and under previous ownership was part of the Yorkshire Radio Network.

When, in 1989, Pennine Radio was split into Pennine FM and Classic Gold, the AM service became part of a network, initially with sister stations in Hull and Sheffield. In 1995, the Bradford-based radio station became a stand-alone operation owned by The Radio Partnership, which had purchased Pulse FM (now Pulse 1) for £4.6 million, though it continued to lease the name Great Yorkshire Gold. The brand lease ended in March 1997. However Emap had just announced plans to rebrand the Leeds, Hull and Sheffield stations as Magic, with a format of easy listening pop music. However The Radio Partnership decided that it wanted to continue offering a gold format so an agreement was formed with GWR to broadcast their Classic Gold. 75 per cent of the programmes would be supplied by GWR, with local programming coming from Bradford. However on-air promotions for Magic had already started to appear so to avoid any potential confusion amongst listeners, a temporary station called 1278 and 1530 AM West Yorkshire was created to fill the gap until the networking of Classic Gold could begin. 

A couple of years later, Classic Gold was dropped in favour of becoming part of the BIG AM network with sister stations in Stoke and Manchester. Shortly after though, Classic Gold reappeared, simulcasting the GWR/UBC Classic Gold and latterly GCap Gold network with local afternoon programming for West Yorkshire remaining. However, on 1 December 2008 the station was re-launched as a fully local service for West Yorkshire and was one of the last legacy ILR AM stations in England to broadcast local programming.

==Station rebrand==
On 8 February 2019, Pulse 2 and the Wireless Group&#x27;s local radio stations were sold to Bauer Radio. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 27 May 2020, it was announced that Pulse 2 would join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network.

On 13 July 2020, local programming outside weekday breakfast was replaced by networked output from the GHR network, with Pulse 2 retaining its own branding.

On 1 September 2020, the station rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio and merged with ten stations in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising are retained.

<text>The Ireland national rugby union team is the men&#x27;s representative national team for the island of Ireland in rugby union. The team represents both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ireland competes in the annual Six Nations Championship and in the Rugby World Cup. Ireland is one of the four unions that make up the British &amp; Irish Lions. They have players eligible to play for Ireland and the Lions.

The Ireland national team dates to 1875, when they played their first international match against England. Ireland reached number 1 in the World Rugby Rankings for the first time in 2019; the team returned to number 1 for a second time on 18 July 2022 and did not relinquish the top spot until 2 October 2023. Twelve former Ireland players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Early years: 1875–1900===

Dublin University was the first organised rugby football club in Ireland, having been founded in 1854. The club was organised by students who had learnt the game while at public schools in Great Britain. During the third quarter of the nineteenth century, and following the adoption of a set of official rules in 1868, rugby football began to spread quickly throughout Ireland, resulting in the formation of several other clubs that are still in existence, including NIFC (1868); Wanderers (1869); Queen&#x27;s University (1869); Lansdowne (1873); Dungannon (1873); County Carlow (1873); UCC (1874); and Ballinasloe (1875) which amalgamated with Athlone to form Buccaneers.
In December 1874, the Irish Football Union was formed. Initially, there were two unions: the Irish Football Union, which had jurisdiction over clubs in Leinster, Munster and parts of Ulster and the Northern Football Union of Ireland which formed in January 1875 and controlled the Belfast area. The IRFU was formed in 1879 as an amalgamation of these two organisations, convening for the first time on 5 February 1880.

Ireland lost their first test match against England 0–7 at the Oval on 15 February 1875. Both teams fielded 20 players in this match, as was customary in the early years of rugby union; it was not until 1877 that the number of players was reduced from 20 to 15. That same year Ireland&#x27;s first home match, also against England, was held at Leinster Cricket Club&#x27;s Observatory Lane ground in Rathmines, as Lansdowne Road was deemed unsuitable. The first match at Lansdowne Road was held on 11 March 1878, with England beating Ireland by two goals and a try to nil.

Following a six-year period of defeats, in 1881 Ireland finally achieved their first test victory, beating Scotland at Ormeau in Belfast, following a late drop goal from John C Bagot. Ireland turned up two men short for their test in Cardiff in 1884 and had to borrow two Welsh players. Ireland&#x27;s first test match victory at Lansdowne Road on 5 February 1887, was also their first win over England, with the final score of two goals to nil. On the third of March 1888, Ireland recorded their first win over Wales with a goal, a try and a drop goal to nil.

In 1894, Ireland followed the Welsh model of using seven backs instead of six for the first time. After victory over England at Blackheath, Ireland won back-to-back matches for the first time when recording their first win over Scotland on 24 February 1894. Ireland went on to beat Wales in Belfast and win the Triple Crown for the first time.

In the 1890s, Rugby was primarily a game for the Protestant middle class; the only Catholic in Edmund Forrest&#x27;s 1894 team was Thomas Crean. Of the eighteen players used in the three games, thirteen were from three Dublin clubs – Wanderers, Dublin University and Bective Rangers – and the remaining five were from Ulster. They went on to win the Home international championship twice more before the century was out (1896 and 1899), so that by 1901 all four of the Home Unions had tasted success at a game that was growing in popularity with players and spectators.

===Early 20th century: 1901–45===
Such was the level of interest in the visit of the first New Zealand team to Dublin in November 1905 that the IRFU made the match the first all-ticket rugby international in history. Ireland played only seven forwards, copying the then New Zealand method of playing a &quot;rover&quot;. The game ended New Zealand 15 Ireland 0.

On 20 March 1909, Ireland played France for the first time, beating them 19–8. This was Ireland&#x27;s biggest victory in international rugby at that time, their highest points tally and a record five tries. 30 November 1912 was the first time the Springboks met Ireland at Lansdowne Road, the 1906 tour game having been played at Ravenhill. Ireland with seven new caps were overwhelmed by a record margin of 38–0, still a record loss to South Africa who scored 10 tries. In 1926, Ireland went into their final Five Nations match unbeaten and with the Grand Slam at stake lost to Wales in Swansea. Ireland again came close to a grand slam in 1927 when their sole loss was an 8–6 defeat by England.

===Post-war: 1945–70===
In 1948, Ireland clinched their first Grand Slam in the Five Nations. Ireland were champions and Triple Crown winners again in 1949. In 1951, Ireland were once more crowned Five Nations champions.
1952 saw only Ireland&#x27;s second overseas tour, the first for over half a century – as they headed to Argentina for a nine-match trip. The tour included two test matches, their Test record being won one, drawn one. In total, out of the nine matches played, the Irish side was only defeated once by Club Pucará.

On 27 February 1954, Ireland played Scotland at Ravenhill in Belfast. The 11 Republic-based players protested &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, and an abbreviated anthem known as &quot;the Salute&quot; was instead played. Ireland beat Scotland 6–0, and did not play in Northern Ireland again until 2007.

In 1958, Ireland beat Australia 9–6 in Dublin, the first time a major touring team had been defeated.

In the 1958–59 season Ireland came second in the Five Nations beating both Scotland and France who had already won the series.

Ireland managed just three victories in the Five Nations Championship during the early 1960s: against England in 1961, Wales in 1963 and England again in 1964. 1965 saw an improvement as Ireland beat England and Scotland.

On 10 April 1965 at Lansdowne Road Ireland recorded their first ever win over South Africa. In January 1967 Ireland again beat Australia in Dublin, 15–8. Ireland became the first of the home nations to win in the Southern Hemisphere and the first of the Five Nations sides to win in Australia, when they beat Australia 5–11, in Sydney in May 1967. On 26 October 1968, Ireland made it four successive wins over the Wallabies.
In 1969, Ireland claimed a 17–9 victory over France in the Five Nations, a first victory over Les Bleus in 11 years. In the autumn of 1969, the Irish Rugby Football Union appointed a coach for the national team for the first time, the role went to Ronnie Dawson.

===Later 20th century: 1970–94===

The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed when Scotland and Wales refused to play in Ireland following threatening letters to players, purportedly from the IRA. The championship remained unresolved with Wales and Ireland unbeaten. In 1973, despite similar threats, England fulfilled their fixture and were given a five-minute standing ovation. Ireland won 18–9. Ireland came close to a first win over the All Blacks on 20 January 1973, but drew 10–10. In 1974, Ireland won their first Five Nations Championship since 1951.

The decision to play two tests in apartheid-era South Africa in May 1981 led to boycotts of Irish athletes in other codes, and was not supported by the Irish government. Several prominent players refused to participate in the tour, while others were refused leave by their employers for the tour.

Willie John McBride was coach until 1984. In 1982, Ireland, led by out-half Ollie Campbell, won the Five Nations and their first Triple Crown in 33 years. Three years later in 1985, Ireland won the Five Nations and the Triple Crown again. It was Ireland&#x27;s last silverware until 2004.
Ireland scored 10 tries against Romania in a 60–0 win on 1 November 1986, the biggest win by a Tier One country in international rugby at the time.
At the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, victories over Tonga and Canada saw Ireland through to the quarter-finals, where they were beaten 33–15 by joint hosts Australia.

Ireland failed to win the Five Nations in the whole of the 1990s, never finishing outside the bottom two. In 1991, they lost their test series against Namibia.
At the second Rugby World Cup in 1991, after wins over Japan and Zimbabwe, Ireland lost 15–24 at Murrayfield. Ireland played the Wallabies at Lansdowne Road in the quarter-finals and appeared to be on the verge of a shock victory over Australia, when Michael Lynagh scored the winning try to clinch a 19–18 win for Australia.
At the 1994 Five Nations Championship, Ireland beat England at Twickenham.

===Professional era and new stadium: 1995–2013===

At the 1995 World Cup, Ireland came through their group to make their third consecutive quarter-final appearance. France proved too strong, with Ireland going down 12–36 in the quarter-finals.

The start of the professional era was disappointing for Ireland, who finished bottom of the Five Nations Championship three years in succession (1996, 1997 and 1998) and lost to Italy three times, at home (29–37) and abroad (12–22 and 22–37). Warren Gatland took over as coach in 1998, but was unable to produce immediate success. The 1999 World Cup was staged primarily in Wales, though Ireland played all their pool games in Dublin. In a play-off, Ireland were beaten 28–24 by Argentina, marking the first time that Ireland failed to reach the quarter-finals.

From this nadir, however, Irish rugby improved. The Irish Rugby Football Union converted the four representative provincial sides into &quot;de facto&quot; club sides, and the formation in 2001 of the Celtic League (now called the Pro14) provided Irish provincial sides with regular competitive rugby. The move to provincial professionalism was a significant success, relying on strong provincial identities long recognised in Irish sport.

The advent of the new Six Nations format coincided with this Irish resurgence. In 2001, Ireland finished second. Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan took over as coach in November 2001 after Warren Gatland was sacked.
The 2003 Six Nations Championship saw Ireland lose to England in the Grand Slam decider at Lansdowne Road, ending a home unbeaten run that stretched to 10 tests since September 2002. 
In the 2004 Six Nations, Ireland finished second overall and won the Triple Crown. In the 2005 Six Nations, Ireland finished in third place.

In the 2006 Six Nations, Ireland won the Triple Crown for the second time in three years. In the last autumn international at Lansdowne Road, Ireland beat Australia 21–6.

With the rebuilding of Lansdowne Road, a new venue was required. Croke Park, home of the Gaelic Athletic Association, hosted some games from 2007 to 2010. Ireland&#x27;s 2008 Six Nations campaign included three losses. Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan resigned as Ireland coach and Declan Kidney was appointed. 
Ireland won the 2009 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam, their first Six Nations win since 1985 and their first Grand Slam since 1948. After a draw against Australia and victories against Fiji and South Africa, Ireland ended 2009 unbeaten.

In Ireland&#x27;s final game of the 2010 Six Nations, and the last-ever game at Croke Park, Ireland lost to Scotland 20–23 and failed to win the Triple Crown. Ireland began their 2010 Autumn Tests with a 21–23 loss to South Africa, the first international at the new Aviva Stadium.

In the 2011 Six Nations Championship, Ireland lost 22–25 to France in the first Six Nations match to be played at the Aviva Stadium. During a 13–19 loss against Wales, Ireland&#x27;s Ronan O&#x27;Gara became the first Irishman, and only the fifth player, to score 1,000 points. In Ireland&#x27;s 24–8 win against England, Brian O&#x27;Driscoll scored his 25th try to set a new Six Nations record for tries scored.

In their 2012 Six Nations Championship campaign Ireland finished third overall. Ireland&#x27;s 2012 summer tour of New Zealand included a 22–19 loss, followed by a 60–0 thrashing, Ireland&#x27;s heaviest ever defeat.
The 2013 Six Nations Championship saw Ireland finish with one win, three losses, and one draw, including their first home loss to England in 10 years; and their first ever loss to Italy in the Six Nations. 

===Joe Schmidt &amp; Andy Farrell Era: 2013–===

The IRFU declined to extend Declan Kidney&#x27;s contract, and Joe Schmidt was announced as the new Ireland coach.
In their 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests, Ireland lost 22–24 to New Zealand, having led throughout the match.

Ireland opened their 2014 Six Nations Championship with wins over Scotland and Wales. Ireland lost 10–13 to England. Ireland won their next match against Italy 46–7. Ireland beat France 22–20 in the final round to claim the Six Nations title. In November they defeated South Africa 29–15 and Australia 26–23 at Dublin.

Ireland retained the 2015 Six Nations Championship, and became Six Nations Champions for the second year running on points difference. Following wins against Wales and Scotland during warm-up matches for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Ireland briefly reached its highest-ever position of second in the World Rugby rankings. Ireland won its pool at the 2015 Rugby World Cup with a 24–9 victory over France, but lost in the quarter-finals to Argentina 20–43.

In January 2016, having been sacked by England a month prior, Andy Farrell was appointed defence coach replacing Les Kiss. Entering the 2016 Six Nations competition with a squad depleted by injury, Ireland won only two matches in the tournament (58–15 against Italy in Round 4, and 35–25 against Scotland in Round 5), and only achieved a 16–16 draw against Wales. The team went on to win the first of their three-match tour of South Africa 26–20, before losing the second and third tests 26–32 and 13–19. In autumn of the same year, Ireland defeated the New Zealand All Blacks for the first time ever on 5 November 2016 in Chicago by 40–29. This was New Zealand&#x27;s only loss all year, and ended their record-breaking win streak of 18 test matches. Despite New Zealand winning the return fixture in Dublin the following week 21–9, Ireland moved up to fourth in the world rankings. It had taken a wait of 111 years for Ireland to finally beat New Zealand with the first match being played in 1905.

Ireland placed second in the 2017 Six Nations Championship, behind defending champions England, who the Irish defeated in the final of round of the competition by 13–9, ending England&#x27;s record-equalling run of 18 victories since 2015. However, they lost to Scotland 22–27 in Round 1 and Wales 9–22 in Round 4 during the same tournament. With many first-choice players selected to tour with the British &amp; Irish Lions, Ireland took a development squad into their summer games that year, which included a 55–19 win over the USA, and a 2–0 test series victory against Japan. In November 2017, Ireland moved to third in the world rankings following their biggest-ever win over South Africa, 38–3, and victories over Fiji and Argentina.

After winning the 2018 Six Nations Championship with a Grand Slam, Ireland moved up to second in the world rankings. A 2–1 series win over Australia in summer that year was followed by a second victory in two years against the world number one All Blacks, by 16–9 which cemented Ireland&#x27;s number two ranking and most accumulated rating points (91.17) in their history. Following their success in the Six Nations, the Australia tour and the autumn internationals, Ireland were named 2018 World Rugby Team of the Year with Joe Schmidt claiming World Rugby Coach of the Year.

The 2019 Six Nations started with a defeat to England, by 20–32. After this, they beat Scotland, Italy and France, but the competition concluded with a loss against Grand Slam winners Wales which ended 7–25. The Welsh led the Irish by 25–0 going into overtime, until a last-gasp try from replacement half-back Jordan Larmour. However, Ireland achieved some redress when they defeated Wales back-to-back, home and away, in the 2019 Rugby World Cup warm-up matches and subsequently reached number 1 in the World Rugby Rankings for the first time in their history, which they retained going in to the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

The 2019 Rugby World Cup ended in disappointment for the Irish, who opened their campaign with a rousing 27–3 win over Scotland, but were felled the following round in a shock 12–19 defeat to tournament hosts Japan. Ireland overcame their other pool opponents Russia (35–0) and Samoa (47–5) to reach the quarter-finals, but were knocked out by New Zealand 46–14. The loss to the All Blacks represented Ireland&#x27;s seventh exit at the quarter-finals of a World Cup, having never reached a semi-final, and saw their place in the world rankings fall from 1st going into the tournament to 5th by its conclusion.

2020 saw Ireland&#x27;s first Six Nations campaign under former defense coach Andy Farrell, who replaced Joe Schmidt after the World Cup, interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the disruption, Ireland notched wins against Scotland (19–12) and Wales (24–14) before losing against England 12–24. Ireland&#x27;s fourth-round game against Italy was delayed until October that year, with the Irish recording a 50–17 win, going on to a 27–35 defeat against France to finish the truncated tournament in 3rd place. In the subsequent Autumn Nations Cup, Ireland again defeated Wales (32–9) and Scotland (31–16) but were beaten once again by England, 7–18. Their performance in the game against Georgia, although a comfortable win on the scoreboard (23–10) was criticized for a perceived lack of spirit or tactical ingenuity. Ireland finished 2020 with their ranking unchanged, at 5th in the world.

The 2021 Six Nations took place again amidst the ongoing pandemic, with spectators still excluded. In this changed environment Ireland would have an indifferent campaign, once again finishing 3rd with wins over Italy (48–10), Scotland (27–24) and England (32–18), after losing their opening two matches to France (13–15) and eventual champions Wales (16–21). Ireland played most of the game against Wales down to 14 men after veteran flanker Peter O&#x27;Mahony became the first Irish player to be red carded in a Six Nations match, for a foul on Wynn Jones in the 14th minute. Ireland achieved two victories in the 2021 July tests against Japan (39–31) and the United States (71–10). Ireland finished the season with an 8–2 record, following a clean sweep in the Autumn Nations series, defeating Japan (60–5), New Zealand (29–20) and Argentina (53–7).

Ireland opened their 2022 Six Nations campaign with an emphatic 29–7 victory over Wales, only to lose to France 30–24 the next week at the Stade De France. They then defeated an ill-disciplined Italy in Dublin 57–6 and got their biggest win over England at Twickenham since 1964 (15–32). On the final day of the tournament, Ireland had to win against Scotland and France had to lose against England in order for Ireland to win the Championship. Ireland won the Triple Crown on the final day of the tournament, beating Scotland 26–5 in Dublin, but failed to win the Championship after France beat England 25–13 in Saint-Denis.

After losing the opening test match of the 2022 New Zealand tour, Ireland scored their first victory against the All Blacks on New Zealand soil on 9 July 2022, their fourth win over New Zealand. Three days later, they followed up their historic win with their first victory over the Maori All Blacks in four attempts, beating the side 24–30 in Wellington. On 16 July 2022 Ireland became just the fifth touring side and first in the professional era to achieve a series win in New Zealand, beating the All Blacks 22–32 in Wellington for a 2–1 series victory. Following that victory Ireland officially became the world number one team for the second time in their history.

On 18 March 2023, Ireland won the Grand Slam for the fourth time in a 29–16 victory over England in Dublin.

In September 2023, Ireland opened their 2023 Rugby World Cup campaign with their biggest ever win at a Rugby World Cup beating Romania 82–8. Ireland subsequently won their matches against eventual champions South Africa and against Scotland 36–14 at Stade de France. Despite their group stage success, Ireland still could not overcome the quarter-final hurdle, losing 24–28 to New Zealand. This loss also ended the side&#x27;s 17 consecutive Test victories, an Irish record. Having gained 19 table points this was Ireland&#x27;s most successful group stage of a World Cup campaign.

Ireland&#x27;s 31–7 victory over Wales in the 2024 Six Nations tied England&#x27;s record for the most consecutive Six Nations victories at 11 and also extended Ireland&#x27;s longest run of home wins to 18. Ireland became back-to-back Six Nations outright champions for only the third time in their history, defeating Scotland 17–13 at home on 16 March 2024.

On 13 July 2024 Ireland defeated World Champions South Africa (24–25) with a last minute drop goal in Kings Park, Durban earning a series draw, 1-1. Following this victory Ireland regained the Raeburn Shield which they had surrendered to New Zealand after their 2023 World Cup quarter-final defeat. 

On 30 November 2024, Ireland concluded their 2024 Autumn Nations Series with a 22-19 over Australia, coached by former head coach Joe Schmidt. Though Schmidt had previously coached against Ireland as an assistant with New Zealand at the 2023 Rugby World Cup, this was the first time they had faced a Schmidt-coached side in Ireland. This was also the first time Ireland had come back from an eight point deficit at half time for eight years. Furthermore, this was recognised as the 150th anniversary game for the IRFU and marked by wearing an anniversary kit for the fixture. In addition, Cian Healy became Ireland&#x27;s all-time leading appearance maker overtaking Brian O&#x27;Driscoll to make his 134th appearance. It was also the final game Andy Farrell would take charge of before his sabbatical to coach the British &amp; Irish Lions for the 2025 tour of Australia. Assistant coach Simon Easterby would assume the head coach duties for the 2025 Six Nations and summer tour in his absence.

==Playing strip==

Ireland&#x27;s traditional strip consists of a green jersey, white shorts, and green socks. Their emblem consists of a shamrock and a rugby ball; a shamrock has been incorporated into the emblem since the side first played in 1874.

Between 1996 and the summer of 2002, Ireland&#x27;s main shirt sponsor was Irish Permanent who became Permanent TSB after a merger, who continued to sponsor the shirt until the autumn of 2006. O2 were Ireland&#x27;s main shirt sponsor from then until 2014. Three Ireland were the team sponsors up until the summer of 2016 where Vodafone then became the main sponsor.

Before 1992, Umbro supplied kit to Ireland. Nike were the suppliers between 1992 and the summer of 2000. Canterbury of New Zealand took over after the summer of 2000 and was the supplier until June 2009. In November 2009, Puma took on the supply of Ireland&#x27;s playing and training kit. In January 2014, the IRFU signed a deal with Canterbury for the supply of Ireland&#x27;s playing and training kit from November 2014 until 2020, which was then extended to 2024.

==Flags and anthems==

The Irish rugby union team is one of many sporting teams that draws its players from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and as such players and supporters may identify as Irish, Northern Irish, British or some combination thereof. This has led to issues surrounding the flags and national anthems.

When Ireland international matches used to be played alternately in Belfast and Dublin, the British national anthem &quot;God Save the King/Queen&quot; was played before matches in Belfast and the national anthem of Ireland &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; was played for matches in Dublin. No anthem was played at away games. With the advent of the Rugby World Cup in 1987, anthems became more of a feature of matches. With the World Cup being hosted by Australia and New Zealand, Ireland&#x27;s stance of having no away anthem began to stand out. Ireland used &quot;The Rose of Tralee&quot; for their match against Wales, but it was not well received and in the subsequent matches no anthem was played. 

In early 1995, a new anthem, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot;, was composed for the team, as the position of having no away anthem became unsustainable. It is played at games held anywhere in Ireland and overseas matches.

Home matches are now nearly exclusively played in Dublin, where &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; is played first, followed by &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot;. There has only been one match held in Belfast since 1953 - Ireland&#x27;s test match against Italy in the run up to the World Cup in 2007. On this occasion, only &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; was played.

The debate over anthems continues to some degree, with some players and supporters arguing that &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; should be played overseas, while others arguing that the British National Anthem should be played before Belfast matches (when they occur). The position of the IRFU is that outside the Republic of Ireland only &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; is to be played.

At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, 2015 Rugby World Cup, 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2023 Rugby World Cup the Ireland team entered the field of play at the beginning of their matches with the Irish tricolour and the Flag of Ulster.

==Home grounds==
The traditional home of Irish rugby is Lansdowne Road in Dublin, where most of Ireland&#x27;s home matches were held. The stadium was rebuilt between 2007 and 2010. Naming rights were sold to an insurance company, and the venue is now referred to as the Aviva Stadium.

The original stadium, owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union, was built in 1872, and so the venue continues to hold the distinction as the oldest still in use for international rugby. In 1878 the ground hosted its first rugby Test, with Ireland playing host to the English (the first representative rugby match had taken place prior to the Test, a game between Ulster and Leinster). Lansdowne Road had a capacity of just over 49,000 before it was demolished in summer 2007. The redeveloped stadium seats 51,700 and was opened in May 2010. The final Irish Test prior to work commencing on the remodelled stadium was against the Pacific Islanders in late 2006.

With Lansdowne Road unavailable for use, Ireland was without a suitable home ground for the subsequent Six Nations. The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) owned Croke Park (an 82,500 capacity stadium), was made available for Ireland&#x27;s two home games against France and England in 2007. It was the first time ever that rugby had been played at the venue. Croke Park remained in use for Ireland&#x27;s Six Nations matches and other major Tests until the completion of the redevelopment at Lansdowne Road.

The first Ireland match at the rebuilt stadium was against reigning World Cup champions South Africa on 6 November 2010. South Africa won the match 23–21. Because of the historic significance of this match, South Africa announced that they would wear their change strip to allow Ireland to wear their home green; normally, the home team change their colours in the event of a clash.

Although Ireland has never totally hosted the Rugby World Cup, select games from both the 1991 and 1999 World Cups were played throughout venues in Ireland. Pool B in 1991 was mainly played in Ireland and Scotland, with two games at Lansdowne Road (involving Ireland) and one (Zimbabwe v Japan) played at Ravenhill, Belfast. A quarter-final and a semi-final were also hosted by Dublin. A similar system was used in 1999, though in addition to Lansdowne and Ravenhill, Thomond Park was also a venue. Lansdowne Road was also the host of a quarter-final in 1999. Ireland were set to host matches at Lansdowne Road for the 2007 World Cup, but due to scheduling conflicts with the reconstruction of the stadium, they decided they were not in a position to host any.

==Performances==
===Overall===

Below is a table of test matches played by Ireland up to 22 February 2025. 

===Rugby World Cup===

Ireland have competed at every Rugby World Cup tournament. The furthest they have progressed is the quarter-finals, which they have made eight times out of ten. They have finished top of their pool three times; in 2011, after beating pool favourite Australia, in 2015 leaving France in 2nd place, and in 2023 when they defeated the reigning world champions South Africa.

In the first tournament, held in Australia and New Zealand in 1987, Ireland finished second in their pool after a loss to Wales, before Ireland were knocked out by Australia in the quarter-final in Sydney.

In 1991 Ireland again lost one match in pool play, this time to Scotland. Ireland again met Australia in the quarter-finals, losing by one point.

In 1995 Ireland were runner-up in their pool to the New Zealand national rugby union team. Ireland were defeated by France in their quarter-final in Durban.

In 1999 Ireland finished second in their pool behind Australia, and went into the quarter-final play-offs (a system exclusive to the 1999 tournament). There they lost to Argentina, and thus, not being a quarter-finalists, Ireland were not given automatic entry into the 2003 tournament.
In qualifying matches, Ireland defeated Russia and Georgia to advance to the 2003 tournament. Ireland finished second to Australia in their pool, and were knocked out by France in the quarter-finals.

In the 2007 World Cup Ireland played in the so-called &quot;Group of death&quot; with hosts France, Argentina, Namibia and Georgia. Ireland defeated Namibia in their opening game 32–17. Their progress was then put into doubt when they beat Georgia 14–10, not obtaining a bonus point. Ireland lost to France 3–25. Entering their last group match against Argentina, needing four tries to secure a bonus point without allowing Argentina anything, Ireland were defeated 15–30 and crashed out at the pool stage for the first time.

Ireland were in Pool C for the 2011 Rugby World Cup with Australia, Russia, USA and Italy. Their first pool game, against the United States, ended in a 22–10 victory for Ireland. Ireland&#x27;s second pool game was against Australia. Despite being underdogs, Ireland recorded their first victory over Australia at a World Cup with a 15–6 win. Ireland comfortably beat Russia 62–12 in their third pool game. Ireland secured first place in the pool with a 36–6 win over Italy, the first time that Ireland were group winners in their World Cup history. Ireland lost their quarter-final to Wales 10–22.

Ireland topped Pool D of the 2015 Rugby World Cup with four victories, two with bonus points. They kicked off their campaign with a 50–7 win over Canada. Another bonus point victory followed in front of a world record Rugby World Cup crowd of 89,267 at Wembley Stadium, when Ireland saw off Romania 44–10. Ireland then faced Italy, coming out on top 16–9, the only try coming from Keith Earls who surpassed Brian O&#x27;Driscoll as Ireland&#x27;s leading Rugby World Cup try scorer with eight. 
The final pool game saw Ireland face France. Ireland came out 24–9 winners. The victory set up a game for Ireland against Pool C runners up Argentina. Ireland battled their opponents, but a series of mistakes spelt the end for Ireland&#x27;s RWC of 2015.

Ireland qualified automatically for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. They played in pool A along with the hosts, Japan, Scotland, Russia and Samoa. They finished the pool with three wins and one loss to finish second behind Japan. They played New Zealand in the quarter-finals where they lost 46–14.

Ireland went into the 2023 Rugby World Cup as the top-ranked team and started their campaign with a bonus point 82–8 win over Romania. During their 2nd match against Tonga, Johnny Sexton became Ireland&#x27;s all-time top points scorer with a try in the 1st half. Ireland beat reigning world champions South Africa and then Scotland to finish top of their group. They played New Zealand in the quarter-final for the second tournament in a row, which they lost 24–28.

===Home Nations – Five Nations – Six Nations Championships===
The Six Nations Championship, held every year in February and March, is Ireland&#x27;s only annual tournament. It is contested against England, France, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Ireland was a member of the inaugural Home Nations in 1883, with France and Italy joining later to form the Five and Six Nations respectively. Ireland won their first championship in 1894, also winning the Triple Crown. Ireland&#x27;s first Grand Slam occurred in the 1948 season and their second in the 2009 season. Ireland won their third ever Grand Slam in the 2018 Six Nations Championship with a 24–15 win over England at Twickenham on St Patrick&#x27;s Day. Ireland won their fourth Grand slam and first in Dublin following their 29–16 victory over England in the 2023 Six Nations. Ireland beat Scotland on 16 March 2024, to become back-to-back Six Nations outright champions for only the third time in history, emulating the class of 1949 and 2015.

===Hall of Fame===

Twelve former Ireland players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame. The Hall was created in 2006 as the IRB Hall of Fame when the sport&#x27;s governing body of World Rugby was known as the International Rugby Board. The separate International Rugby Hall of Fame, which had inducted five Ireland players, was merged into the IRB Hall in 2014, shortly before the IRB adopted its current name of World Rugby. All International Hall members who had not been separately inducted to the IRB Hall automatically became members of the renamed World Rugby Hall.

<text>Maynard Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Sensenbrenner (September 18, 1902 – August 2, 1991) was an American politician of the Democratic party, who served as a populist mayor of Columbus, Ohio.

==Biography==
The son of a jeweler, Sensenbrenner was born in rural Circleville, Ohio, south of Columbus on U.S. Route 23. Sensenbrenner graduated from Circleville High School and attended a Bible college in Los Angeles, intending to follow his twin brother Marion into the ministry, but he did not complete the course. Sensenbrenner worked in a variety of jobs, including working in oil fields and for the advertising department of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. During the Great Depression, he worked as a Fuller Brush salesman in southern California. His move to the west coast was prompted by Mildred Harriet Sexauer, the niece of a former mayor of Lancaster, Ohio. When her family moved out West to find work, Jack followed. Jack and Mildred married in 1927 and remained married for over fifty years, producing three children, Patricia (died at birth), Edward and Richard. In 1934, he returned to Circleville and started working in sales. Soon after he moved to Columbus, settling on the West side where he became a partner in a religious bookstore.

In 1953, Sensenbrenner, then a stranger to politics (although he had been active in the Columbus community) surprised the Franklin County Democratic Committee with a visit to announce his intentions to run for mayor of Columbus. The party was without any strong hopefuls — Columbus had not had a Democratic mayor since 1935 — but they would not endorse Sensenbrenner. Only after a runoff within the party did Sensenbrenner secure the Democratic nomination. His upset win in 1954 was written up around the country. His success might have largely been due to Sensenbrenner&#x27;s decision to campaign on local television, which was uncommon at the time.

Sensenbrenner was unseated from 1960 to 1963 by Republican Ralston Westlake, but was reelected to a second mayoral term. He served as Columbus&#x27;s mayor from 1954 to 1960 and again from 1964 to 1972. He laid the groundwork for the massive growth of Columbus in the late 20th century by requiring all neighborhoods that accepted city water service to be annexed into the city. His policy allowed Columbus to grow to become the largest city in Ohio. Under his leadership Columbus grew by more than . He would be the city&#x27;s last Democratic mayor for 28 years.

Sensenbrenner was a popular political character in Columbus, known for throwing around terms like &quot;spizzerinctum&quot;, which, he said, was the quality that made &quot;Columbus, the United States of America, the Boy Scouts of America ... absolutely dynamic.&quot; (He picked up the term from his high school football coach.) He habitually wore a straw skimmer hat and at the drop of a hat would perform an old-fashioned shuffle dance. His creed &quot;God, Love and Country&quot; helped to win Columbus the coveted &quot;All-America City Award&quot; from the National Civic League in 1958.

When the Columbus Zoo&#x27;s western lowland gorilla had her first baby in 1968, the name Emmy was chosen for the little girl, named after &quot;M. E.&quot; Sensenbrenner. Emmy died in 1982. Her mother Colo was the first gorilla born in captivity and proved to be longest living gorilla in captivity as of her death in 2017.

The Sensenbrenners&#x27; grandson, Edward&#x27;s son Richard Sensenbrenner, served as a member of the Columbus city council.

<text>USS &quot;Bell&quot; (DD-95) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Bell&quot;, named for Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell, was launched 20 April 1918 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. Josephus Daniels, wife of the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, and commissioned 31 July 1918.

On 5 August 1918 she damaged the steam lighter &quot;Cornelia&quot; in a collision. &quot;Cornelia&quot; had to be beached on Deer Island, in the harbor at Boston, Massachusetts.
From August to November 1918 &quot;Bell&quot; convoyed troop ships across the North Atlantic and in December formed part of the escort for &quot;George Washington&quot; carrying President Woodrow Wilson from New York to Brest, France. &quot;Bell&quot; continued serving with the Atlantic Fleet until placed in reserve in June 1920. She was decommissioned at Portsmouth Navy Yard 21 June 1922. &quot;Bell&quot; remained out of commission until August 1936 when she was declared in excess of the limits imposed by the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and reduced to a hulk. She was subsequently sold.

<text>SCMITR was part of an experimental military shotgun ammunition created in the 1970s by AAI Corporation. It was a variation on flechette ammunition, but instead of containing a bundle of tiny needle-like steel darts, the cartridge contained a stack of razor-edged stamped sheet-metal arrow shapes designed to fly aerodynamically. It was considered to be very promising (in terms of lethality and effective range) but prohibitively expensive to manufacture, so it has never been mass-produced.

==Development==
SCMITR was part of the CAWS (Close Assault Weapon System) program, which investigated ~20 mm smoothbore weapons (basically combat shotguns) designed to be effective to ranges of 150 metres against combatants wearing body armor. Flechettes, with their high sectional density, were ideal for penetrating rigid or soft composite armor, but the wounds caused by the tiny darts were considered insufficient to disable an enemy combatant, as the tiny hole would quickly clot and cause relatively little bleeding. The SCMITR darts had the same sectional density as flechettes, but the wide, flat shape of the SCMITR produced a larger, more disabling wound. Since the SCMITR darts were stamped from sheet metal, they had only two fins, which is not enough to provide stability. To overcome this, the fins were twisted slightly, which causes the dart to spin when flying, producing a stable projectile.

The SCMITR cartridge was loaded with eight of these flechettes, each weighing about 1 gram. Dispersion was low, with all eight flechettes capable of hitting within a four-metre circle at a range of 150 metres. Retained velocity at 150 metres was 365 m/s, sufficient for the flechettes to penetrate 76 mm of pine or 3 mm of mild steel.

==Applications==
The SCMITR project was cancelled with the cancellation of the CAWS project in the late 1980s. The most commonly encountered photograph, in Thomas Swearengen&#x27;s book &quot;The World&#x27;s Fighting Shotguns&quot;, shows a SCMITR shell clearly marked as a 20 gauge, smaller than the nominal 12 gauge bore used by the AAI CAWS entry.

<doc id="955552" wikidata="Q1192036" url="?curid=955552" title="Microsleep">
<text>A microsleep is a sudden temporary episode of sleep or drowsiness which may last for a few seconds where an individual fails to respond to some arbitrary sensory input and becomes unconscious. Episodes of microsleep occur when an individual loses and regains awareness after a brief lapse in consciousness, often without warning, or when there are sudden shifts between states of wakefulness and sleep. In behavioural terms, microsleeps may manifest as droopy eyes, slow eyelid-closure, and head nodding. In electrical terms, microsleeps are often classified as a shift in electroencephalography (EEG) during which 4–7 Hz (theta wave) activity replaces the waking 8–13 Hz (alpha wave) background rhythm.

==Definition==
Some experts define microsleep according to behavioral criteria (head nods, drooping eyelids, etc.), while others rely on EEG markers. Since there are many ways to detect microsleeps in a variety of contexts there is little agreement on how best to identify and classify microsleep episodes.

==Causes==
Microsleeps frequently occur as a result of sleep deprivation. However, individuals who are not sleep-deprived or tired can also experience microsleeps during monotonous tasks.

==Effects==
Microsleep is extremely dangerous when it occurs in situations that demand constant alertness, such as driving a motor vehicle or working with heavy machinery. People who experience microsleeps often remain unaware of them, instead believing themselves to have been awake the whole time, or to have temporarily lost focus.

==Background and significance==

With over 1,550 fatalities and 40,000 nonfatal injuries occurring annually in the United States alone as a result of drowsy driving, sleep loss has become a public health problem. When experiencing microsleeps while driving an automobile, from the perspective of the driver, they are driving a car, and then suddenly realize that several seconds have passed by unnoticed. It is not obvious to the driver that they were asleep during those missing seconds, although this is in fact what happened. The sleeping driver is at very high risk for having a collision during a microsleep episode.

Historically, many accidents and catastrophes have resulted from microsleep episodes in these circumstances. For example, a microsleep episode is claimed to have been one factor contributing to the Waterfall rail accident in 2003; the driver had a heart attack, and the guard who should have reacted to the train&#x27;s increasing speed is said by his defender to have microslept, thus causing him to be held unaccountable. On May 31, 2009, an Air France plane (Air France Flight 447) carrying 228 people from Brazil to France crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing everyone on board. The pilot of the plane reported &quot;I didn&#x27;t sleep enough last night. One hour – it&#x27;s not enough,&quot; handing over control to the two co-pilots who did not respond appropriately when the plane was in distress. 
A possible microsleep was recorded as part of the narrative verdict in the inquest into the 2016 Croydon tram derailment.

Thus, microsleeps are often examined in the context of driver drowsiness detection and prevention of work-related injuries and public safety incidents (e.g. truck crashes, locomotive crashes, airplane crashes, etc.). Some statistics are below:
*44% of drivers during late-night driving become dangerously sleepy.
*Extremely fatiguing work protocols increase accident probability from near 0% to 35%. 
*Chronic microsleeps not only increase probability for injury but also decrease worker productivity and increase likelihood for absenteeism from work.
*According to one Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study, among 74,571 adult respondents in 12 U.S. states, 35.3% reported &lt;7 hours of sleep during a typical 24-hour period, 48.0% reported snoring, 37.9% reported unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once in the preceding month, and 4.7% reported nodding off or falling asleep while driving at least once in the preceding month.
*The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 2.5% of fatal crashes and 2% of injury crashes involve drowsy driving.
*Fatigue is associated with 250 fatalities in air carrier accidents in the last 16 years.
 Microsleep episodes are not dangerous in and of themselves, however. The only risk that comes is from the potential that they carry to cause incidents resulting from lack of awareness. If an individual has occurrences of microsleep in an environment that is free from potential environmental risk and its associated consequences, then episodes of microsleep should be non-problematic.

==Neural correlates==
Generally, microsleeps are characterized by a decrease in activity in wakefulness-related regions of the brain and an increase in activity in sleep-related regions of the brain. Looking at neural correlates of microsleeps is difficult because microsleeps can also be triggered by monotonous tasks (e.g. such as driving or dozing off in class). Therefore, it is important to examine neural correlates of microsleep events with respect to experimental set-ups (e.g. simulated driving set-up, reaction time set-up, etc.). Individual variability in brain structure also makes it difficult to diagnose microsleep events objectively.

In one study, neural activity underlying microsleeps was investigated by simultaneously measuring eye video, response behavior, EEG, and fMRI in normally-rested individuals engaged in a sensory-motor task. Twenty participants tracked a visual stimulus with a joystick for 50 minutes in 2 dimensions (up/down/right/left) on a computer screen. Participants performed this task in an fMRI scanner such that joystick response, right eye-video, EEG (60 EEG electrodes), and fMRI data were recorded simultaneously. Most participants had frequent microsleeps (&gt;35) in a continuous visuomotor task (tracking visual stimulus on a screen), corresponding with decreased activity in arousal-related brain regions over time (thalamus, midbrain, and the posterior cingulate cortex).

Another study examined the activation patterns of 5 people who woke up from microsleeps in a simulated driving experiment. It was found that upon awakening the visual area, frontal cortex, limbic lobe were activated (in the intense activation phase) and the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, primary motor area, and insula were activated (in the post abrupt awakening phase). Therefore, the study concluded that decision-making was not activated immediately upon waking up from a microsleep episode, likely increasing risk of injury in intense decision-making tasks like driving or surgery.

The transition from wakefulness to sleep is regulated by a variety of chemicals. Adenosine likely causes the &#x27;feeling sleepy&#x27; side of microsleeps, while dopamine likely reduces microsleep events by promoting wakefulness. It has been shown that microsleeps correlate with spontaneous pontine-geniculate-occipital (PGO waves) waves, which suppress visual processing in the basal ganglia. When this pathway is not activated, cells in the superior colliculus (which causes release of dopamine) cannot be dis-inhibited via the basal ganglia, leading to poor processing ability and microsleep onset.

==Detection methods and classifications==
There are currently many ways to detect microsleeps; however, there is a lack of general consensus as to the best way to identify and classify microsleeps. The simplest methods to detect these events seem to be through psychological tests, speech tests, and behavioral tests (e.g. yawn test and eye-video test). More complex and expensive ways to detect microsleeps include EEG, fMRI, EOG, and PSG tied to various software platforms. When multiple tests are used in parallel, detection of microsleeps most likely will become more accurate.

Despite attempts to globally classify microsleeps through these detection methods (with particular emphasis on EEG and slow eyelid closure tests), there is great variability in the types of microsleeps that people experience. Subjective, self-reported psychological tests like the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), though widely adopted and positively correlated to EEG, often have limited utility because individuals sometimes are not aware of their level of sleepiness. Future research needs to focus more on objective microstates (e.g. detailed electrical output in briefer intervals) that underlie microsleep events so that electrical events can be understood in terms of behavioral events with greater accuracy. Then microsleep events could be more seamlessly distinguished from other states of consciousness, such as silent consciousness experienced during meditation.

==Disorders, clinical studies, and pharmacology==
Microsleeps are often tied to disorders. Sleep apnea is by far the most significant disease tied to microsleeps in terms of prevalence, affecting roughly 10–15 million people. Other disorders that may be tied to microsleeps include narcolepsy, hypersomnia, schizophrenia, and other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness. Microsleep episodes are often neglected and are not used as a diagnostic indicator for these disorders. Instead, clinicians use instrumentation like PSG to do a sleep study on patients to assess overall sleep quality in a laboratory setting.

Microsleeps that recur and negatively influence day-to-day living often are clustered into the category of excessive daytime sleepiness. Thus, most clinical studies related to microsleeps are in the context of reducing microsleeps in excessive daytime sleepiness through the use of pharmacological interventions. Particularly, modafinil has become a popular drug to reduce microsleeps due to its eugeroic effect with comparatively mild side effects relative to classical psychostimulants. New drugs are often compared to the results of modafinil and placebo to assess efficacy (e.g. methylphenidate in Parkinson&#x27;s Disease). Modafinil is also being tested across a range of disorders such as schizophrenia, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and sleep apnea. Overall, the trajectory of clinical studies relating to negative symptom microsleeps seems to more thoroughly test modafinil across more disorders and compare new drugs to the efficacy of modafinil to reduce the negative effects of microsleeps on people across a spectrum of disorders.

Microsleeps sometimes are a side effect of various drugs, particularly in reference to dopamine-stimulating drugs in Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. Particularly, somnolence is a recognized adverse effect of dopamine agonists, pramipexole and ropinirole. These drugs are known to cause sudden-onset sleep spells in roughly 50% of patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD) while they were driving. Therefore, clinical interventions pertaining to microsleeps may also encompass reducing excessive sleepiness as a side effect of drug administration. Orexin antagonists such as daridorexant and suvorexant may cause hypersomnolence and microsleeps.

Most microsleeps are not clinically significant, however. Individuals who feel sleepy and wish to maintain alertness often consume over-the-counter stimulants such as caffeine in coffee. More specifically, it has been shown that high-frequency low-dose caffeine intake is effective at countering poor work performance effects due to extended wakefulness, confirming the hypothesis that adenosine is a mediator of performance decrements associated with extended wakefulness. Other stimulants that could decrease microsleep frequency include Adderall, amphetamine, cocaine, and tobacco.

<doc id="955560" wikidata="Q3053217" url="?curid=955560" title="Southernmost settlements">
<text>Southernmost settlements are cities, towns, weather stations or permanent military bases which are farther south than latitude 45°S. They are closely related to the Southern Ocean or either the Roaring Forties or Furious Fifties. Antarctic bases are excluded due to not having a permanent population.

Unlike the northern hemisphere, where several major metropolitan areas such as Moscow, Harbin, London, Paris, Seattle, and Montreal are all located north of the 45°N parallel, the only permanently populated areas south of the 45°S parallel are the small and sparsely populated regions of southern Patagonia in South America, the Falkland Islands, and the southernmost tip of New Zealand.

==Southernmost city==
&quot;The southernmost city in the world&quot; is mainly a slogan used for tourism purposes to attract visitors to a city as well as the tourists headed for Antarctica. &quot;Ciudad&quot; (city) is not a legal designation in Chile and Argentina, except for the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Currently, three places use this slogan: Ushuaia in Argentina as well as Punta Arenas and Puerto Williams&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.infinito-sur.com&quot;&gt;http://www.infinito-sur.com/ , retrieved 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; in Chile, with the last being the absolute southernmost town by latitude (see table below). There are several more settlements further south but none are considered to be large enough to be classified as a &#x27;city&#x27;. The three contending cities are from north to south:

*Punta Arenas (, population: 123,403), literally in Spanish: &quot;Sandy Point&quot;, is the oldest and largest city in Southern Patagonia, at the Strait of Magellan and the capital of the Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region. It is the largest of the three contenders with around 130,000 permanent residents and it is called the southernmost city by some media outlets. The basis of its claim to be the southernmost city rests on it being larger than Ushuaia, Río Grande, and Puerto Williams, all of which are farther south.
*Ushuaia (, population: 82,615), the capital of the Argentine province of Tierra del Fuego, is more commonly regarded as the southernmost city in the world due to its sufficiently large population, its infrastructure, and its accepted classification as a city. Ushuaia is located in a wide bay on the southern coast of the island of Tierra del Fuego, on the northern shore of the Beagle Channel; hence, it is further north than Puerto Williams.

*Puerto Williams (, population: 1,868), located on Isla Navarino, is the southernmost town in the world on the southern shore of the Beagle Channel. It is the capital of the Antártica Chilena Province, one of four provinces located in the Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region. Puerto Williams is sometimes considered the southernmost city in the world by Chilean media and some large media international organisations, although it promotes itself with the slogan &quot;Puerto Williams, the southernmost town in the world&quot; in its tourism campaigns. It has a Naval Hospital of Puerto Williams, the Martin Gusinde Anthropological Museum, the Guardiamarina Zañartu Airport and a university campus and it is a naval base of the Chilean Navy.

==Settlements of more than 1,000 inhabitants south of 45°S==

This is a list of all settlements south of the 45th parallel south with over 1,000 permanent inhabitants.

==Southernmost settlements outside Antarctica==
This list of settlements excludes research stations in Antarctica and its surrounding islands.
*The former Argentine base Corbeta Uruguay (59°28′ S) in South Sandwich Islands was the southernmost settlement outside Antarctica from 1976–1982.

==Settlements on the Antarctic continent==

There are many research stations in Antarctica, both permanent and summer only. Many of the stations are staffed all year. McMurdo Station is the largest with an average population of 1200.

A total of 30 countries (as of October 2006), all signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, operate seasonal (summer) or year-round research stations on the continent and on its surrounding islands. In addition to these permanent stations, approximately 30 field camps are established each austral summer to support specific one off projects.

The full list is available at:
Research stations in Antarctica.

<doc id="955564" wikidata="Q1342280" url="?curid=955564" title="Squamish, British Columbia">
<text>Squamish (; , ; 2021 census population 23,819) is a community and a district municipality in the Canadian province of British Columbia, located at the north end of Howe Sound on the Sea to Sky Highway. The population of the Squamish census agglomeration, which includes First Nation reserves of the Squamish Nation although they are not governed by the municipality, is 24,232.

Indigenous Squamish people have lived in the area for thousands of years. The town of Squamish had its beginning during the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway in the 1910s. It was the first southern terminus of that railway (now a part of CN). The town remains important in the operations of the line and also the port. Forestry has traditionally been the main industry in the area, and the town&#x27;s largest employer was the pulp mill operated by Western Forest Products. However, Western&#x27;s operations in Squamish permanently ceased on January 26, 2006. Before the pulp mill, the town&#x27;s largest employer had been International Forest Products (Interfor) with its sawmill and logging operation, but it closed a few years prior to the pulp mill&#x27;s closing. In recent years, Squamish has become popular with Vancouver and Whistler residents escaping the increased cost of living in those places, both less than one hour away by highway. Tourism is increasingly important in the town&#x27;s economy, with an emphasis on outdoor recreation.

== Squamish people ==

The Squamish people are an indigenous people whose homeland includes the present day area of Squamish, British Columbia. Oral stories and archaeological evidence show that they have lived there for thousands of years. They have inhabited an area of southwestern British Columbia that includes North and West Vancouver, Howe Sound, Whistler, the areas surrounding the tributaries entering Howe Sound, Burrard Inlet, and English Bay. The word &quot;Squamish&quot; derives from the name of the people which in their language is &quot;Sḵwx̱wú7mesh&quot;. The people reside primarily on a number of Indian Reserves owned and managed by the Squamish Nation in the Squamish Valley area. A few places and names in the Squamish area derive from Squamish language words and names. &quot;Ch’iyáḵmesh&quot; is the name of an old village that was located on the Cheakamus River. &quot;St’á7mes&quot; is a community located near the south entrance to the town of Squamish, which lies below the Stawamus Chief, which gets its name from that village. &quot;Mámx̱wem&quot; is where the Mamquam River name comes from as well.

Squamish territory comprises 6,732 km², though lands controlled by the Squamish Nation band government are relatively scarce, and on Indian reserves only, though the Squamish Nation must be, like other native governments, consulted on developments within their people&#x27;s territory. Residents of Indian Reserves are not governed by the District of Squamish but by the Squamish Nation. The Squamish Nation&#x27;s population and Indian Reserves also include villages in North Vancouver and a number of other reserves at Gibsons and elsewhere in the general region.

The name &quot;Keh Kait&quot; was the traditional name for the site of downtown Squamish.

==Activities==
Squamish is known for mountain biking, hiking, climbing, kiteboarding, and more.

Attractions include the Stawamus Chief, a huge cliff-faced granite massif favoured by rock climbers. As well as over 300 climbing routes on the Chief proper, a majority of which require traditional climbing protection, there are steep hiking trails around the back to access the three peaks that make up the massif, all giving views of Howe Sound and the surrounding Coast Mountains. In all, between Shannon Falls, Murrin Park, The Malamute, and the Smoke Bluffs, there are over 1500 rock-climbing routes in the Squamish area (and another 300 or so climbs north of Squamish on the road to Whistler). In recent years, Squamish has also become a major destination for bouldering, with over 2500 problems described in the local guidebook.

Kiteboarding and windsurfing are popular water sports in Squamish during the summer. Predictable wind on warm sunny days makes the Squamish Spit a top kiteboarding location in western Canada.

Squamish&#x27;s extensive quality trail system is a key feature of an annual 50-mile ultra trail run, the Squamish 50. Solo runners and relay teams run on many of the same trails as the Test of Metal, and pass through Alice Lake Provincial Park and the campus of Quest University. &quot;The Double&quot; is an award offered annually to the participant with the fastest combined time for both the Test of Metal and Arc&#x27;teryx Squamish 50.

From 1974 to 1999, Squamish served as the terminus for the Royal Hudson steam excursion train. The train was pulled by the restored ex-Canadian Pacific No. 2860 and ran from North Vancouver on Howe Sound, until it reached Squamish. The train significantly boosted tourism in the region. Due to issues with No. 2860, back up locomotives were used to pull the train from 2000-2001, including No. 3716 and diesel locomotive No. 4069, until the train was phased out and no longer was running.

Other tourist attractions in Squamish include Shannon Falls waterfall; river-rafting on the Elaho and Squamish rivers; snowmobiling on nearby Brohm Ridge; and bald eagle viewing in the community of Brackendale, which has one of North America&#x27;s largest populations of bald eagles. Squamish is also a popular destination among Greater Vancouver hikers, mountaineers and backcountry skiers, who visit the large provincial parks in the surrounding Coast Mountains.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Squamish is Armand Hurford, who won the 2022 election, after having served as a council member.

<text>Miriam Leder (; born January 26, 1952) is an American film and television director and producer; she is noted for her action films and use of special effects. She has directed the films &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; (1997), &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998), &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000), and &quot;On the Basis of Sex&quot; (2018). She was the first female graduate of the AFI Conservatory, in 1973. She has been nominated for ten Emmy Awards, winning two.

==Early life==
Miriam Leder was born in New York City in 1952, the daughter of Etyl, a classical pianist, and Paul Leder, a director, producer, actor, writer, and editor of films including &quot;My Friends Need Killing, A*P*E,&quot; and &quot;I Dismember Mama.&quot; Leder grew up in Los Angeles in a Jewish household. Her mother is a Holocaust survivor (Auschwitz concentration camp) from Brussels, Belgium. During childhood, her father, a low-budget independent filmmaker, introduced Mimi and her siblings to film production. Her father often dropped her off at the cinema to watch the latest films. Leder said that one of the early films which had an impact on her was Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½.&quot; She was the first woman accepted into the AFI Conservatory, where she studied cinematography.

==Film career==
Leder began her career as a second unit director on her father&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;A*P*E&quot;, then as a script supervisor on a string of films, including &quot;Spawn of the Slithis&quot; (1978), &quot;Dummy&quot; (1979), &quot;The Boy Who Drank Too Much&quot; (1980), and &quot;A Long Way Home&quot; (1980) and then moved to the TV series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981). After making the short film &quot;Short Order Dreams,&quot; written and funded by her father Paul, she screened it for Steven Bochco, creator of &quot;Hill Street Blues,&quot; and his friend Gregory Hoblit who hired her to direct an episode of &quot;L.A. Law.&quot;

In 1988, Leder directed episodes of &quot;Crime Story,&quot; &quot;The Bronx Zoo,&quot; &quot;Midnight Caller,&quot; then directed several episodes of &quot;China Beach&quot; (1988–91) for which she was nominated for four Emmys. She made the made-for-TV films &quot;Woman with a Past&quot; (1992), &quot;House of Secrets&quot; (1993), and &quot;Baby Brokers&quot; (1994), then became one of the core directors for &quot;ER&quot; (1994–2009). The show earned her Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series in 1995 and 1996. She returned to direct an episode of the series during its final season in 2009. She soon received a job offer from Steven Spielberg to direct the film &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; (1997).

Continuing to work for DreamWorks, she directed &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998) and &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000) while simultaneously creating &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; (1999), a personal love story about her parents. When asked for a reaction about her film &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998) vs. a rival movie release at the same time &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), she responded: &quot;Michael Bay did come to my premiere, which really shocked me. And I can tell you that after—after [seeing] my film—he went and reshot the end of his.&quot; After making &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; Leder went through a period where she wasn&#x27;t hired to direct any feature films. &quot;Most women who don&#x27;t have commercial success are not asked back to the party. It did not hurt me in television, but it did in features.&quot; Leder felt as though she had been put into a &quot;movie jail&quot; by Hollywood for the lack of success of &quot;Pay It Forward.&quot;

Leder&#x27;s dry spell of feature films after the release of &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; drove her to other pursuits in television and film. She shot nine pilots and produced six series, including &quot;The Beast&quot; (2001), &quot;John Doe&quot; (2002), &quot;Johnny Zero&quot; (2005), and &quot;Vanished&quot; (2006). Leder also made many made-for-TV movies such as &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; (2009), &quot;U.S. Attorney&quot; (2009), and &quot;Heavenly&quot; (2011). In 2015, Leder was brought by HBO to direct a first-season episode of &quot;The Leftovers&quot; and later hired as a co-showrunner.

Leder&#x27;s feature film &quot;On the Basis of Sex,&quot; the story of Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s path to become a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, was released in December 2018. It was Leder&#x27;s first theatrical feature in 18 years.

==Personal life==
Leder has a daughter, Hannah, with her husband actor Gary Werntz. Mimi Leder has said she &quot;was raised a feminist&quot; and &quot;was an anti-war protester all during the Vietnam War.&quot;

<text>A combat shotgun is a shotgun issued by militaries for warfare. The earliest shotguns specifically designed for combat were the trench guns or trench shotguns issued in World War I. While limited in range, the multiple projectiles typically used in a shotgun shell provide increased hit probability unmatched by other small arms.

== History ==

While the sporting shotgun traces its ancestry back to the fowling piece, which was a refinement of the smoothbore musket, the combat shotgun bears more kinship to the shorter blunderbuss. Invented in the 16th century by the Dutch, the blunderbuss was used through the 18th century in warfare by the British, Austrian, Spanish (like the Escopeteros Voluntarios de Cadiz, formed in 1804, or the Compañía de Escopeteros de las Salinas, among others) and Prussian regiments, as well as in the American colonies. As use of the blunderbuss declined, the United States military began loading smaller lead shot (buckshot) in combination with their larger bullets, a combination known as &quot;buck and ball&quot;. The buck and ball load was used extensively by Americans at the Battle of New Orleans in 1814 and was partially responsible for the disparate casualty rates between American and British forces. The advantage of this loading was that it had a greater chance of hitting the enemy, thus taking wounded soldiers out of a fight. The disadvantage of this load was that the buckshot did not cause as severe wounds at longer ranges, and contemporary accounts show many of the British wounded recovering quickly as they had been struck by the buckshot rather than the ball. Fowling pieces were commonly used by militias, for example during the Texas Revolution. However, buck and ball worked as well or better in standard or even rifled muskets. Buck and ball loads were used by both sides of the American Civil War, often by cavalry units.

The development of repeating pump-action shotguns in the 1890s led to their use by the US Marines in the Philippines insurrections and by General &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing&#x27;s pursuit of Pancho Villa, and &quot;riot&quot; shotguns quickly gained favor with civilian police units, but the modern concept of the combat shotgun was fully developed by the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. The &quot;trench gun&quot;, as it was called, was a short-barreled pump action shotgun loaded with 6 rounds containing antimony-hardened 00 buckshot, and equipped with a bayonet. The M1897 and M1912 also could be slam fired: the weapon having no trigger disconnector, shells could be fired one after the other simply by working the slide if the trigger was held down, though in the heat of combat one could easily short-stroke the weapon and jam it. When fighting within a trench, the shorter shotgun could be rapidly turned and fired in both directions along the trench axis. The shotguns elicited a diplomatic protest from the German government, claiming the shotguns caused excessive injury, and that any troops found in possession of them would be subject to execution. The US Government rejected the claims, and threatened reprisals in kind if any US troops were executed for possession of a shotgun.

The shotgun was used by Allied forces and Allied-supported partisans in all theaters of combat in World War II, and both pump and semi-automatic shotguns are currently issued to all branches of the US military; they have also been used in subsequent conflicts by French, British, Australian, and New Zealand forces, as well as many guerrillas and insurgents throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Latin and South America, and Southeast Asia. Six different model of shotguns were accepted in the US army during World War II, the most popular being the M97 and M1912. One disadvantage of using a shotgun in the Pacific Theatre was the way of carrying the shotshells. The standard rifle pouches that carried shotshells were small, only about 30 rounds if carried vertically. Some Marines carried the shells in SL-3 grenade vests from World War I, but these vests were hard to come by. Also used were modified bandoliers and whatever came to hand or could be improvised.

Another disadvantage was paper-hulled shotshells, which would swell when they became damp in a rainy or humid environment, and would not fit into the chamber even after drying out. Commercial paper hulls were later impregnated with wax to make them water resistant, but in combat the heat from rapid firing would cause the wax to melt, often resulting in a jammed gun. Military-issue shotshells were usually made entirely of brass to avoid these issues, until the introduction of plastic hulls in the early 1960s.

General Alexander Patch was seen armed with a Winchester shotgun when he personally led an attack in Guadalcanal.

In the jungle warfare during the Malayan Emergency, the British Army and local forces of Malaya used shotguns to great effect due to limited space in the jungles and frequent close combat. In the Vietnam War, the shotgun was used as an individual weapon in the American army during jungle patrol and urban warfare like the Tet Offensive.

During the Somalian conflict in 1992, during Operation Gothic Serpent, the US task forces tested out a new type of Remington shotgun called Ciener Ultimate Over/Under, which was an under-barrel attachment for the standard M16 variants. The idea was for a soldier in an entry team to be able to breach a locked door with the shotgun and then immediately switch to the assault rifle to clear the room. According to the Army Rangers, their verdict was positive for this new type of breaching gun.

In operations in post-invasion Iraq, US forces used their combat shotguns to clear out suspected insurgent hideouts in house to house fighting. One notable experimental shotgun used in limited numbers during Operation Enduring Freedom is the XM26 for breaching doors or close-quarter battle (CQB).

Combat shotguns have seen use in the Russo-Ukrainian War in the anti-drone role although their effectiveness remains unclear.

== Characteristics ==

The most common type of shotgun used for this purpose is the manually operated, slide-action/pump-action type like the Remington M870 or Mossberg 590A1. The latter is currently the pump-action of choice for US armed forces, and both have seen service with other militaries. The pump-action type is less prone to malfunction (particularly when dirty) than semi-automatic designs. Pump-action shotguns are also less expensive than their semi-automatic counterparts. Even so, semi-automatic shotguns such as the Benelli M1014 are currently seeing service in NATO-aligned armed forces.

Combat shotguns typically have much shorter barrels than shotguns used for hunting. They usually have magazines of modified design to hold more than the 3 to 5 shots normal with sporting or hunting shotguns. Most combat shotguns have tubular magazines mounted underneath the barrel. These are identical to those of hunting shotguns, except for being longer to hold more ammunition. Some recent designs have detachable box magazines.

Combat shotguns are mostly similar to the police riot shotgun. The military versions may have provisions to mount a bayonet, and may be fitted with ventilated steel or plastic hand guards over the barrel to reduce the danger of a soldier burning their hand on the hot barrel during rapid fire. Riot shotguns are more likely to trade off increased magazine capacity for decreased size. For example, a combat model would be more likely to have a barrel and up to a 10-round capacity, while riot shotguns are often found with barrels of and a capacity of 5 to 8 rounds.

== Combat use ==
The combat shotgun has evolved from its original role as a short range combat weapon into a wider role in modern times. With proper configuration, ammunition and training, the modern combat shotgun plays three roles:

# Offensive weapon
# Breaching system
# Less-lethal crowd control

Effective range of the shotgun with standard buckshot is limited to about 20–30 meters. Slug rounds, if available, can extend the effective range of the shotgun to 100 meters (although this is also dependent on the shotgun&#x27;s sighting system; rifle sights and ghost ring sights will allow the average shooter to effectively engage human-sized targets at considerably greater distances than with a bead sight).

Less lethal rounds vary, with ranges from 10 meters for rubber buckshot to 75 meters for rubber slugs. These less lethal munitions are the same type as used by police, and have served well in riot control situations, such as that in Kosovo in 2001.

When used as a door breaching system, the shotgun may be provided with a muzzle extension to allow it to be pressed firmly against the door while providing the correct standoff distance for optimum performance. While there are specialized rounds for breaching doors with minimal hazard to any occupants of the room, any type of round will do the job, though with some degradation of effectiveness and increased risk of collateral damage. In operations in Iraq, the shotgun was the preferred method of door breaching by infantry units, ideally with a frangible breaching slug. For the breaching role, shorter barrels are preferred, as they are more easily handled in tight quarters.

Limited ammunition capacity is one of the primary downsides of the combat shotgun. While box magazines are available in some models (such as shotgun derivatives of the AK-47 design, like the Saiga-12), the tubular magazine is still dominant. This limits capacities; the current US pump shotgun issued, the Mossberg 590, has a 5 or 8 shot capacity depending on barrel length. The tubular magazine does allow easy &quot;topping off&quot; (a tube-fed pump shotgun can be kept shouldered and aimed at a target and ready to fire while being loaded), so training emphasizes the need to load the magazine to full capacity whenever the opportunity presents itself. A common doctrine is &quot;shoot one, load one&quot;: load a shell immediately after every shot (when this does not jeopardize the operator&#x27;s safety), to ensure that the shotgun is fully loaded at all times; this ensures that the operator has a full magazine at their disposal in case of emergencies when they may not be able to reload in between shots. A pistol is also advised as a backup weapon, should the operator empty the magazine and not have time to reload. A sling to carry the shotgun is essential if it is to be used in conjunction with another weapon, so that the shotgun may be readily accessible.

The bulk and weight of shotgun ammunition also limits its utility as a general-issue weapon. Weight per 100 rounds of an average 12-gauge 00-buck shell is ; for an average .223/5.56 round, weight per 100 rounds is about or a 3.8:1 weight ratio of 12-gauge buckshot and 5.56×45mm. This means just eight 12-gauge buckshot shells weigh approximately the same () as thirty 5.56×45mm rifle cartridges. While an individual soldier can easily carry several hundred rifle or pistol cartridges in box magazines, only a few dozen shotshells can be carried practically.

== Effectiveness ==
A Joint Service Combat Shotgun Program report on the lethality of shotguns in war states, in support of the use of the shotgun in warfare, &quot;the probability of hitting a man-sized target with a shotgun was superior to that of all other weapons&quot;, and goes on to support this with statistics compiled by the British from the conflict in Borneo in the 1960s — Operation Claret.

The buckshot typically used in a combat shotgun spreads out to a greater or lesser degree depending on the barrel choke, and can be effective at ranges as far as . The delivery of the large number of projectiles simultaneously makes the shotgun the most effective short range weapon commonly used, with a hit probability 45% greater than a sub-machine gun (5-round burst), and twice as great as an assault rifle (3-round burst). While each pellet is only roughly as effective as a small caliber handgun round, and offers very poor penetration against an armored target, the multiple projectiles increases the likelihood of one or more peripheral wounds.

A number of compromises are involved in choosing a shot size:

* Smaller pellets lose velocity more rapidly and penetrate the target less
* Larger pellets means fewer pellets, resulting in a reduced probability of hits
* Heavier loads produce more recoil and greater velocity than lighter loads
* Reduced recoil loads (less shot and/or lower velocity) may produce smaller patterns, which may decrease hit probability

== Ammunition ==

The most common type of ammunition used in combat shotguns, whether for military or law enforcement purposes, is buckshot, typically a 70 mm (2 inch) 12-gauge shell loaded with nine hardened 00 buckshot, with a diameter of about . Buckshot is brutally effective at close ranges against unarmored targets—enough so that Germany issued a protest against its use in 1918. The only other types of ammunition currently in use in military shotguns are breaching rounds, which are either specially designed frangible rounds designed to destroy a door lock or hinge while minimizing the risk of damage to occupants of the room or very light (#9) birdshot, which accomplishes the same purpose. Shotgun slugs are currently under consideration by the US military as an anti-materiel round; the tendency of typical commercial shotgun slugs to deform on impact would render them illegal under the Hague Convention of 1899 and so a jacketed, hardened or sabot slug may be adopted. Less lethal rounds are used by U.S. troops serving as police forces in occupied territory; beanbag and rubber bullet rounds are commonly used to discourage looters and rioters.

In military use, flechette ammunition has also been used in shotguns (primarily by special forces, such as its use by the SEALs in the Vietnam War), but this is not common. Other experimental shotgun ammunition has been created, such as SCMITR, but none have been successful enough to be adopted.

Due to the great flexibility of the shotgun, it is often used in non-offensive roles as well. The US Infantry, for example, offers a number of less lethal varieties of ammunition for use in the riot control role, and for door breaching with #9 birdshot, shotgun slugs, and specialized breaching rounds. Less-lethal options also include the use of grenade launching cups, special launching cartridges and a less-lethal grenade.

There are a number of experimental rounds currently under development and consideration by the US military, including explosive rounds and stand-off breaching rounds, which could further improve the range and flexibility of the combat shotgun.

== Method of operation ==

There are two primary modes of operation for combat shotguns, the pump action, and various semi-automatic designs, mostly gas operation and recoil operation designs. The SPAS-12, SPAS-15, and Benelli M3 shotguns, combine the two, offering pump action or, when the pump is locked forwards, autoloading operation. There have also been a few fully automatic shotguns produced such as the AA-12.

The autoloading shotgun (semi or fully automatic) offers a higher rate of fire than a pump shotgun, though controlling a heavy recoiling shotgun in rapid fire is difficult. The autoloading action is more suitable for firing from a prone position, as operation of a pump action moves the elbow normally used to support the shotgun, and it can more effectively be used one-handed, unlike pump actions which require two hands for effective cycling of the action.

The pump shotgun is more versatile than the semiautomatic, as it will fire low powered less lethal munitions which lack sufficient pressure to cycle the action in an autoloading design. A pump shotgun, which does not rely on its ammunition for energy to cycle, operates normally with the lower powered ammunition, and provides utility in combat and riot control situations. In addition, the pump shotgun has an advantage in situations such as door breaching, where the shotgun is immediately dropped (retained by a sling) and replaced by another weapon after the door has been breached. By not cycling the action after firing the final breaching rounds (multiple rounds are often required) the pump shotgun is left without a loaded round in the chamber, unlike a semiautomatic shotgun.

== Use in asymmetric warfare ==

Due to the widespread use of the shotgun as a sporting firearm, it is used in guerrilla warfare and other forms of asymmetric warfare. Che Guevara, in his 1961 book &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, notes that shotgun ammunition can be obtained by guerrillas even in times of war, and that shotguns loaded with heavy shot are highly effective against unarmored troop transport vehicles. He recommends that suburban guerrilla bands should be armed with easily concealable weapons, such as handguns and a sawed-off shotgun or carbine. Guevara also mentions an improvised weapon developed by guerrillas consisting of a sawed-off 16-gauge shotgun provided with a bipod to hold the barrel at a 45-degree angle. Called the &quot;M-16&quot;, this was loaded with a blank cartridge formed by removing the shot from a standard shotshell. A wooden rod was then placed in the barrel, with a Molotov cocktail attached to the front. This formed an improvised mortar capable of firing the incendiary device accurately out to a range of 100 meters.

<text>Don L. Crawford was an American politician of the Democratic party, who was the first African-American person to serve as a city commissioner of Dayton, Ohio. He served on the commission from 1962 to 1967. While presenting a key to the city to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964, Crawford remarked that the key would not actually open many parts of the city to him, angering the other city commissioners.

Wright State University, which holds his papers, called him, &quot;one of Dayton’s best-known
African American leaders of the 1960s-1980s.&quot; A park and Don Crawford Plaza are named after him.

<text>The 1259 Treaty of Paris, also known as the Treaty of Abbeville, was a peace treaty agreed between King LouisIX of France and King HenryIII of England on 4 December 1259, briefly ending a century-long conflict between the Capetian and Plantagenet dynasties.

==History==
The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, created an awkward situation whereby the kings of England were sovereign over some of their territory but bound by homage to the kings of France for other rich and well-populated lands on the Continent. William attempted to separate the two areas between his heirs, but subsequent fighting and inheritance not only reunited England and Normandy but greatly expanded English territory within France. King John&#x27;s refusal to answer PhilipII of France for the apparent murder of his teenage nephew Arthur gave Philip a pretext for recovering Normandy in 1204. The English recovered the Channel Islands and remained in control of Aquitaine, however, and, despite the 1217 Treaty of Lambeth, both the English and French kings continually engaged in wars of conquest and reconquest over Normandy and their borderlands.

==Terms==
Under the treaty, Henry acknowledged the loss of the Duchy of Normandy. Henry agreed to renounce control of Maine, Anjou, and Poitou, which had also been lost under the reign of King John, but remained Duke of Aquitaine as a vassal to Louis. In exchange, Louis withdrew his support for English rebels. He also ceded to Henry the bishoprics and cities of Limoges, Cahors, and Périgueux and was to pay an annual rent for his continued occupation of Agenais.

Despite acknowledging the loss of Normandy, the treaty separately held that &quot;islands (if any) which the King of England should hold&quot; would be retained by him &quot;as peer of France and Duke of Aquitaine&quot;. Along with subsequent English denunciations of their French vassalage, this formed the basis of the special situation of the Channel Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, and some smaller islands), which have been held directly by the English Crown without formal incorporation into the Kingdom of England or its successor states.

==Aftermath==
Doubts on the treaty&#x27;s interpretation began almost as soon as it was signed. The agreement continued the unstable situation whereby English monarchs were obliged to submit to the French kings for disputes over their territories on the continent. The French historian Édouard Perroy considered that the Treaty of Paris &quot;was at the very root of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.&quot;

<text>Ivry-sur-Seine () is a commune in the Val-de-Marne department in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris.

Paris&#x27;s main Asian district, the Quartier Asiatique in the 13th arrondissement, borders the commune and now extends into the northern parts of Ivry. Asian commercial activity, especially Chinese and Vietnamese, has greatly increased in Ivry-sur-Seine during the past two decades. The commune contains one of the highest concentrations of Vietnamese in France, who began settling in the city in the late 1970s after the Vietnam War.

Politically, Ivry-sur-Seine has historically demonstrated strong electoral support for the French Communist Party (PCF). Between 1925 and today (except for the period of German occupation in World War II), the office of mayor was held by just four individuals: Georges Marrane, Jacques Laloë, Pierre Gosnat and Philippe Bouyssou, all members of the Communist Party.

Ivry-sur-Seine is twinned with Bishop Auckland in County Durham, England.

==Name==
Originally, Ivry-sur-Seine was called simply Ivry. The name Ivry comes from Medieval Latin &quot;Ivriacum&quot; or &quot;Ibriacum&quot;, perhaps meaning &quot;estate of Eburius (the Latinized form of the Gallic patronym Eburos)&quot;, a Gallo-Roman landowner.

In 1897, the name of the commune officially became Ivry-sur-Seine (meaning &quot;Ivry upon Seine&quot;), in order to distinguish it from other communes of France also called Ivry.

==History==
On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, about a third of the commune of Ivry-sur-Seine was annexed to Paris, and now forms the Chinatown area of the 13th arrondissement of Paris.

Ivry-sur-Seine is perhaps most famous as the place of execution of Jean Bastien-Thiry in March 1963. Richard Ellman also notes that James Joyce&#x27;s daughter, Lucia, received psychiatric treatment in the commune&#x27;s hospital in 1936 and was visited by both Joyce and Samuel Beckett.

==Economy==
Fnac has its head office in the commune. The head office moved there in 2008. E.Leclerc&#x27;s head office is in the commune.

==Transport==
Ivry-sur-Seine is served by two railway stations on the Paris Métro Line 7: Pierre et Marie Curie and Mairie d&#x27;Ivry.

The east of the commune is served by Ivry-sur-Seine station on Paris RER line C with stops at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France and the city centre.

Orly Airport is located to the south of Ivry-sur-Seine.

== Education ==
Senior high schools:
* Collège et lycée Romain Rolland
* Lycée technique Fernand Léger

Colleges and universities:
* ESIEA (university)
* ESME Sudria 
* École des technologies numériques appliquées
* Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées
* IONIS School of Technology and Management

As of circa 1998 Ivry and Vitry-sur-Seine had a combined Asian population of 3,600. That year about 250 Asians from those communes worked in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, and the overall demographics of Ivry and Vitry Asians were similar to those in the 13th arrondissement.

<text>Attacotti, &quot;Atticoti&quot;, &quot;Attacoti&quot;, &quot;Atecotti&quot;, &quot;Atticotti&quot;, and &quot;Atecutti&quot; were Latin names for a people first recorded as raiding Roman Britain between 364 and 368, alongside the Scoti, Picts, Saxons, Roman military deserters and the indigenous Britons themselves. The marauders were defeated by Theodosius in 368.

The exact origins of the Attacotti and the extent of their territory are uncertain. In about 400, Roman units recruited among the Attacotti were recorded in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, and one tombstone of a soldier identified as such is known. Their existence as a distinct people is given additional credence by two incidental claims that they practised cannibalism and polyandry (&quot;wives in common&quot;) in the writings of Saint Jerome.

The historian Ammianus provides an account of the tumultuous situation in Britain between 364 and 369, and he describes a corrupt and treasonous administration, native British troops (the Areani) in collaboration with the barbarians, and a Roman military whose troops had deserted and joined in the general banditry. The situation arose as a consequence of the failed imperial power-grab (350–353) by Magnentius (303–353), followed by a bloody and arbitrary purge conducted by Paulus Catena in an attempt to root out potential sympathisers of Magnentius in Britain, and aggravated by the political machinations of the Roman administrator Valentinus.

Ammianus describes the marauders as bands moving from place to place in search of loot. Nevertheless, one Roman commander was killed in a pitched battle and another was taken prisoner in an ambush and killed. (See Great Conspiracy.) As there was no longer an effective military force in the province, a substantial one was sent from Gaul under Count Theodosius, who quickly and ruthlessly restored order. Theodosius then focused his efforts on the repair of political problems within the province.

== &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;: Roman &quot;auxilia palatina&quot; ==
The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; is a list of offices of the early 5th century Roman Empire, and includes the locations of the offices and the staff (including military units) assigned to them. The names of several &quot;auxilia palatina&quot; resemble that of the Attacotti who were mentioned by Ammianus, and in an 1876 publication, historian Otto Seeck assigned the name Atecotti to various spellings (&quot;acecotti&quot;, &quot;atecocti&quot;, &quot;attecotti&quot;, &quot;attcoetti&quot;, &quot;ti&quot;, and &quot;arecotti&quot;) in the Notitia Dignitatum, and documented his assignments within the publication. This produced four conjectural occurrences of Atecotti-related units:

* Atecotti
* Atecotti juniores Gallicani
* Atecotti Honoriani seniores
* Atecotti Honoriani juniores

The discovery of a contemporary funerary dedication to a soldier of the &quot;unit of Atecutti&quot; (emended from &quot;Ategutti&quot;) at Thessalonica, in the Roman Diocese of Illyricum, supports this reconstruction, as the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; places one Atecotti unit in that diocese.

== Saint Jerome: incidental references ==
St. Jerome was a Christian apologist whose writings contain two incidental references to the Attacotti. His account is particularly noteworthy because he was in Roman Gaul , while the Attacotti were known to be in Britain until 368 and may have entered Roman military service soon after. Thus it is credible that Jerome had seen Attacotti soldiers and had heard Roman accounts of the recent fighting in Britain.

In his &quot;Letter LXIX. To Oceanus&quot;, he is urging a responsible attitude towards marriage, at one point saying that one should not be &quot;like the Scots [&quot;ie&quot;, the Irish Scoti] and the Atacotti, and the people of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, to have community of wives and no discrimination of children, nay more, to be aware of any semblance even of matrimony&quot;.

In his treatise &quot;Against Jovinianus&quot; he describes the dietary habits of several peoples and includes a statement that he had heard that the Attacotti ate human flesh. Earlier in the same passage he describes a different people as eating &quot;fat white worms with blackish heads&quot;, and others as eating &quot;land-crocodiles&quot; and &quot;green lizards&quot;. Ancient writers sometimes ascribed exotic habits to far-away peoples in their works. Strabo, for example, said in passing that some Sarmatians and Scythians were cannibals, while others ate no meat at all.

== &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot;: a spurious reference ==
&quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot; was a fictitious account of the peoples and places of Roman Britain. It was published in 1757, after having been made available in London in 1749. Accepted as genuine for more than one hundred years, it was virtually the only source of information for northern Britain (i.e., modern Scotland) for the time period, and some historians eagerly incorporated its spurious information into their own accounts of history. The Attacotti were mentioned in &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot;, and their homeland was specified as just north of the Firth of Clyde, near southern Loch Lomond, in the region of Dumbartonshire.

This information was combined with legitimate historical mentions of the Attacotti to produce inaccurate histories and to make baseless conjectures. For example, Edward Gibbon combined &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot; with St. Jerome&#x27;s description of the Attacotti by musing on the possibility that a ‘race of cannibals’ had once dwelt in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.

== Possible Irish connection ==

Perhaps as early as the 17th century, and certainly in the 18th and 19th centuries, some Irish scholars (Charles O&#x27;Conor and John O&#x27;Donovan, for example) had suggested that the origin of the Attacotti might lie in Ireland. This was based on the perceived similarity between Latin &quot;Attacotti&quot; and the Old Irish term &quot;aithechthúatha&quot;, a generic designation for certain Irish population groups, usually translated &quot;rent-paying tribes&quot;, &quot;vassal communities&quot; or &quot;tributary peoples&quot;. In the context of well-attested Irish raids on the western coast of Britain in the late Roman period, it was suggested that one or more of these population groups might be the raiders reported by Ammianus in the 360s.

The thesis was given impetus when historian Charles O&#x27;Conor promoted it in the late 18th century. However, this remained controversial among scholars into the late 19th century.

Later scholarship has criticised the possible connection between Latin &quot;Attacotti&quot; and &quot;aithechthúatha&quot; on etymological grounds. Early scholars had based their arguments on the Old Irish that was known from medieval manuscripts rather than on the largely hypothetical Primitive Irish used in the 4th century when the Attacotti were in Britain.

Knowledge and understanding of the history of the Irish language were revolutionised from the end of the 19th century, largely owing to the efforts of Rudolf Thurneysen (1857–1940). He hypothesised that &quot;Attacotti&quot; and &quot;aithechthúatha&quot; are unconnected, and that the Primitive Irish equivalent to &quot;aithechthúatha&quot; would be *Ateûiācotōtās. This, in his opinion, is too far removed from the Latin form &quot;Attacotti&quot; in Ammianus. More recent research has shown that some of the Irish population groups involved in the raiding and settlement of Roman and/or sub-Roman Britain could be classified as &quot;aithechthúatha&quot;, however, problems of chronology and identification persist.

<text>Thales Air Defence Limited (TADL), formerly Shorts Missile Systems (SMS), is a defence contractor based in Belfast, Northern Ireland, producing short range air defence missiles. 

Shorts Missile Systems was established as a joint venture between Shorts&#x27; owners Bombardier and Thomson-CSF in 1993. In 2000 Thomson-CSF became the sole owner. In the same year Thomson-CSF was renamed Thales Group and in 2001 Shorts Missile Systems was renamed Thales Air Defence Limited.

TADL products have been deployed by 56 armed forces around the world. The company employs around 492 people in Northern Ireland. The company also operates a remote facility in rural County Down, between Ballynahinch and Downpatrick, where missiles are tested and stored.

==History==
Short Brothers&#x27; missile division was formed in 1952. In 1993, this became Shorts Missile Systems (SMS) a joint venture between Shorts&#x27; owners Bombardier and Thomson-CSF. In 2000 Thomson-CSF bought Bombardier&#x27;s 50% share to become the sole owner. In the same year Thomson-CSF was renamed Thales Group; consequently in 2001 Shorts Missile Systems was renamed Thales Air Defence Limited.

The then Shorts Missile Systems was a partner in Raytheon Company&#x27;s Future Medium Range Air-Air Missile (FMRAAM) project, which was to replace the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile used by European air forces. In May 2000 the UK selected the MBDA Meteor to fulfil the requirement.

<doc id="955614" wikidata="Q5593871" url="?curid=955614" title="Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance is an honor presented to recording artists for quality rap performances. It was first presented at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards in 1989 and again at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1990, after which point the award was split into two categories: Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. These two categories were combined again in 2012 as a result of a restructure of Grammy categories, and the reinstated Award for Best Rap Performance was presented at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012. The restructuring was the consequence of the Recording Academy&#x27;s wish to decrease the number of categories and awards and to eliminate distinctions between solo and duo or group performances.

The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony established in 1958, and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award goes to the artist. The producer, engineer, and songwriter can apply for a Winner&#x27;s Certificate.

The first award for Best Rap Performance was presented to DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince (the vocal duo consisting of DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith) for &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;. The ceremony was not without controversy; nominees Jeff and Smith led a boycott in protest of the awards presentation not being televised, and some members of the rap community felt that more qualified artists were overlooked. After the reintroduction of the category in 2012, American rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West won the award two consecutive times; the two rappers were surpassed in terms of wins by fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, who holds the record with seven awards. American rapper Megan Thee Stallion and American singer-songwriter Beyoncé became the first female artists to win the category with &quot;Savage (Remix)&quot;.

==Background==
The Best Rap Performance category was first presented at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards in 1989. NARAS President Mike Green said in &quot;Billboard&quot; that the music genre has &quot;matured into several kinds of music, with several kinds of artists doing it&quot;. Diane Theriot, a representative of the awards department for the academy, recalled being &quot;inundated with eligible rap entries during the first few years of having the category&quot;. In 1991, the category was split into the categories Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Recognizing that both categories were continuing to receive numerous entries, the Best Rap Album recognition was established for the 38th Grammy Awards in 1996—the inaugural award was presented to Naughty by Nature for &quot;Poverty&#x27;s Paradise&quot;. In 2003, the Best Rap Solo Performance category was divided into separate recognitions for Female and Male Rap Solo Performances. The categories remained separated by gender until 2005 when they were combined into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance. Additional rap categories include Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song, established in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

==History==

For the 31st Grammy Awards (1989), Best Rap Performance nominees included DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince for &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, J. J. Fad for &quot;Supersonic&quot; (from the album of the same name), Kool Moe Dee for &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, LL Cool J for &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;, and Salt-n-Pepa (the duo consisting of Cheryl James and Sandra Denton) for &quot;Push It&quot;. The duo known as DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince consisted of DJ Jazzy Jeff (birth name Jeffrey Townes) and actor Will Smith, whose nickname also appeared in the American television sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, in which he starred. &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; appeared on the duo&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;He&#x27;s the DJ, I&#x27;m the Rapper&quot;. &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Less than Zero&quot; as well as LL Cool J&#x27;s 1989 studio album &quot;Walking with a Panther&quot;. Kool Moe Dee&#x27;s &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; and Salt-n-Pepa&#x27;s &quot;Push It&quot; appeared on the albums &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; and &quot;Hot, Cool &amp; Vicious&quot;, respectively.

Rap and heavy metal categories were introduced the same year (along with Best Bluegrass Album), but, according to the show&#x27;s producers, time constraints prevented both categories from being televised. Nominee Kool Moe Dee performed during the ceremony, but the rap award was presented during the &quot;usually fast-paced pre-televised ceremony&quot;. DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith led a boycott of the ceremony and were joined by fellow nominees LL Cool J and Salt-n-Pepa. Salt-n-Pepa issued the following statement: &quot;If they don&#x27;t want us, we don&#x27;t want them.&quot; Adding to the controversy surrounding the category, some members of the rap community believed artists such as Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and N.W.A (whose debut album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; &quot;launched gangsta rap&quot;) were overlooked. Awards were presented to Jeff and Smith at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. While Smith was absent from the ceremony, Jeff was present to accept his award. In 2004, Serena Kappes of &quot;People&quot; magazine ranked Smith&#x27;s ceremony boycott number eight on its list of Top 10 Grammy Moments. Jeff and Smith were also recognized by the American Music Awards in 1989 with awards for Favorite Rap Artists and Favorite Rap Album, and &quot;Parent&#x27;s Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; also earned the duo the first MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video. Smith later earned Best Rap Solo Performance awards in 1998 for &quot;Men in Black&quot; and 1999 for &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy wit It&quot;, and was nominated again in 2000 for &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;.

Nominees for the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards included De La Soul for &quot;Me Myself and I&quot;, DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince for &quot;I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson&quot;, Public Enemy for &quot;Fight the Power&quot;, Tone Lōc for &quot;Funky Cold Medina&quot;, and Young MC for &quot;Bust a Move&quot;. &quot;Me Myself and I&quot; appears on De La Soul&#x27;s studio album &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; and in 2008 was ranked number 46 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs Ever!!! &quot;I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson&quot;, written by the duo along with Pete Harris, appears on DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince&#x27;s third album &quot;And in This Corner...&quot;. &quot;Fight the Power&quot; appeared on the 1988 soundtrack for the film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; and later on Public Enemy&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; (1990). The song ranked number one on VH1&#x27;s aforementioned list, number 40 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs list, and number 322 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2004 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. &quot;Funky Cold Medina&quot;, written by Young MC, Michael L. Ross and Matt Dike, first appeared on Tone Lōc&#x27;s debut album &quot;Lōc-ed After Dark&quot;. &quot;Bust a Move&quot; appeared on Young MC&#x27;s debut album &quot;Stone Cold Rhymin&#x27;&quot;. Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as &quot;unabashed catchy&quot; due to its &quot;skittish, rhythmic guitar riff, looped beats&quot;, backing vocals, and &quot;funny&quot; rhymes. The award was presented to Young MC. In 2010, Joshua Ostroff of Spinner included Young MC&#x27;s win on his list of &quot;The Grammy Awards&#x27; Biggest Mistakes&quot;, asserting that &quot;Bust a Move&quot; was merely a &quot;fun little hip-pop song&quot; while &quot;Fight the Power&quot; was a &quot;revelatory single that still stands tall as one of music&#x27;s greatest (and funkiest) political statements and perhaps hip-hop&#x27;s finest moment&quot;.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Ukraine]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament.
The Ukrainian Democratic Party was one of the dominant forces in pre-revolutionary Russian Ukraine. Due to the splintered party system in Ukraine, the timeline is limited to the post-1990 period. 

==History==
In the mid-1990s, the Liberal Party of Ukraine (&quot;Liberalna Partia&quot;, observer LI) formed out of small parties in Crimea. The Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc seemed to develop into a more or less liberal party. The UDAR, which as of 2013 holds 42 seats in the Verkhovna Rada, has been described as a &quot;Western-style liberal party&quot;. Other, small liberal parties include Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine, Reforms and Order Party, PORA and Yabluko. Also, the Democratic Party of Ukraine and the Democratic Union have sometimes been referred as liberal parties, though their liberal nature has not been confirmed.

===Ukrainian Radical Democratic Party===
*1905: Inspired by the ideas of Michailo Drahomanov, sympathizers of the Russian Constitutional Democratic Party in Ukraine formed the liberal Ukrainian Radical Democratic Party (&quot;Ukrajin&#x27;ska Radikal&#x27;no-Demokratyčna Partija&quot;).
*1908: The party is reorganized into the Ukrainian Progressive League (&quot;Tovarystvo Ukraijins&#x27;kych Progresystov&quot;), which became the dominant party.
*1917: The party is renamed &quot;Ukrainian Party of Federalist Socialists&quot; (&quot;Ukrajin&#x27;ska Partija Federalistiv-Socialistiv&quot;), which was, despite its name, a liberal democratic party led by Serhij Jefremov. He did not survive the anti-Ukrainian processes by the communist regime. In exile, the party was renamed into its original name, the Ukrainian Radical Democratic Party.

<text>James A. Durrell (born December 15, 1946) is a Canadian business owner, former politician and president of the Ottawa Senators. He served as Mayor of Ottawa from 1985 to 1991.

Durrell has extensive governance experience and has served on numerous boards including the Business Development Bank of Canada, chairman of the Ottawa International Airport&#x27;s Board of Directors, and chairman of the Ottawa Convention Centre. He also sat on the Ottawa Police Services Board. He has worked with numerous charities and organizations including the Ottawa Hospital, the United Way/Centraide Ottawa Campaign Cabinet, the Salvation Army, and the Kiwanis Club. Durrell received the Order of Canada in 2013. His Order of Canada medal capped off a year filled with tributes. In June he was awarded the Ottawa Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award, and three months later was given the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. In November, he received the Order of Ottawa.

He owns Jim Durrell Capital Dodge. Durrell, an insurance executive, was elected to Ottawa City Council in 1980. When long serving mayor Marion Dewar retired Durrell defeated Marlene Catterall running on a right-of-centre platform.

During his time as mayor Durrell was most closely involved in professional sports. He worked to obtain tax grants for the Ottawa Rough Riders football team, encouraged a Triple A baseball team to locate in Ottawa, and most notably he won an NHL franchise for the city. Early in his term, he secured the 1988 Grey Cup for Ottawa, and was involved in Ottawa&#x27;s bid for the 1994 Commonwealth Games, which were later granted to Victoria, British Columbia.

In 1990, Durrell ran for the presidency of the Liberal Party of Canada, but dropped out due to a police investigation into campaign donations during the 1988 election.

In December 1990, Durrell was named president of the new Ottawa Senators team, maintaining this job and his position as mayor. However, he resigned as mayor in January 1991 due to the demands of his Senators job. He served in this role for a number of years, before being forced to leave due to the deep financial troubles of the team. He also served president and chief executive officer of the Ottawa Rough Riders for four months during the team&#x27;s final season.

<text>Witanhurst is a large Grade II* listed 1930s Georgian Revival mansion on in Highgate, North London. It has had several prominent owners since being rebuilt by soap magnate Sir Arthur Crosfield. After several decades of increasing dilapidation, it underwent substantial refurbishment after its 2008 sale to an offshore company owned by the family of Russian businessman Andrey Guryev.

==History==
The original estate, dating from 1774, was known as Parkfield, situated at the junction of Highgate West Hill and The Grove. The current house, built between 1913 and 1920, was designed by architect George Hubbard for soap magnate Sir Arthur Crosfield on an site. The mansion is Grade-II* listed, meaning it has been judged to be of national historic or architectural interest. In the late twentieth-century and early twenty-first century, English Heritage placed the property on its Buildings at Risk Register.

Paul Crosfield sold Witanhurst to the property developer Lionel Green in 1970. It was possessed by banks shortly after, and owned by various other property developers for the next fifteen years. Various schemes for redeveloping Witanhurst were proposed and rejected by Camden council during this period, including turning the house into a hotel or apartments. Various pieces of land from Witanhurst&#x27;s large estate were sold.

In 1976, Witanhurst was bought by Al-Hasouwy for £1.3 million. He spent £500,000 developing the property. It was then put up for sale in 1977 for £7 million, with planning permission for 63 houses. In 1984, the house was sold for £7 million by Noble Investment Corporation, a shell company believed to have been linked to the al-Hasawi family. A revised scheme for 24 houses to be built on part of the land was sold for more than £7 million. 

The buyer of the house was Mounir Developments, a company registered in the tax haven of Panama. The ultimate beneficial owner of Mounir Developments was eventually revealed in a court case to be a relation of the Assad family, the ruling family of Syria, who were then in exile in England. Somar al-Assad, a cousin of the then Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, stated in a court case that he had not slept at Witanhurst in the previous eight years of ownership, by a trust connected to the family.
Witanhurst was used as the location of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Fame Academy&quot; talent show from 2002 to 2004. The interior of the house was renovated to add a recording studio and gym. During its use on the show Witanhurst was on English Heritage&#x27;s list of buildings &quot;at risk&quot;. In 2002, during the first series of &quot;Fame Academy&quot;, nine portable buildings, a television studio and generators were erected in front of Witanhurst without the requisite consent required for a listed building. The production company Endemol withdrew their application to use Witanhurst for a planned third series of the show in 2004 following a critical report by planners from Camden London Borough Council.

In 2007 the Assads sold Witanhurst to the British property developer Marcus Cooper for £32.5 million. Cooper repaired Witanhurst to satisfy Camden council&#x27;s previous complaints, and put the property up for sale for £75 million through the estate agents Glentree Estates and Knight Frank.

Witanhurst was bought by the family of the Russian billionaire Andrey Guryev through an offshore company called Safran Holdings, located in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands for £50 million in 2008. The owner of Witanhurst was not publicly known from its 2008 sale until the publication of a 2015 article by Ed Caesar in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine.
In September 2009 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; erroneously stated that Witanhurst had been bought by Elena Baturina, the wife of the former Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, via an offshore front company. Baturina sued the newspaper&#x27;s owners Times Newspapers, a subsidiary of News International. Times Newspapers apologised for the story and paid damages to Baturina in October 2011.

The redevelopment of Witanhurst has received widespread attention in the media, much of it focusing on the large basement extension to the main house that extends for two storeys below the entire footprint of the building. Over 90,000 square feet, Witanhurst is the second largest private residence in London, after Buckingham Palace. It is said to be worth $450 million.

==Facilities==
The mansion has 65 rooms spread across three floors, including 25 bedrooms. One of the largest is the ballroom, measuring long with a height of . It has oak flooring and the timber wall panels are in walnut, with carved cornices embellished with gold leaf.

Other rooms are the drawing room, study, entrance hall and staircase, and most of the bedrooms are all in an opulent classical style. Other richly decorated rooms include the dining room, Chinese room, billiard room, and the gallery hallway. Access to the property is via a three-fingered gatehouse.

==Filming location==
Witanhurst has been used on several occasions as a filming location by various production companies including the BBC, to shoot films and television programmes such as &quot;The Lost Prince&quot;, &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;, and &quot;Fame Academy&quot;.

<text>The France national rugby union team (, ) represents the French Rugby Federation (FFR; ) in men&#x27;s international rugby union matches. Colloquially known as &quot;Le XV de France&quot; (French for &quot;The XV of France&quot;), the team traditionally wears blue shirts with a Gallic rooster embroidered on the chest, white shorts and red socks in reference to the French national flag. &quot;Les Bleus&quot; (French for &quot;The Blues&quot;) mostly play home matches at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, near Paris. They compete in the annual Six Nations Championship along with England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France have won the tournament on 26 occasions (including 8 shared victories), winning the Grand Slam 10 times.

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by the British before a first France national team was formed in 1893 (as a selection of the best Parisian-club players under the USFSA governance) to face a club in England. A few years later, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1906, the national side played its first test match against New Zealand in Paris. France then played sporadically against the Home Nations until they joined them in 1910 to form the Five Nations Championship. France also competed in the rugby competitions at early Summer Olympics, winning the gold medal in 1900 and two silver medals in the 1920s. The national team came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first Five Nations title outright in 1959. They won their first Grand Slam in 1968. Their last win in the tournament dates back to 2022 under head coach and former team-captain Fabien Galthié, who is currently in charge of the selection.

France has competed in every Rugby World Cup since it began in 1987, and qualified for the knock-out stage each time. They have reached the final three times, losing to New Zealand in 1987 and 2011, and to Australia in 1999. France hosted the 2007 Rugby World Cup, where, as in 2003, they were beaten in the semi-finals by England. In 2023 they hosted for a second time, but they succumbed to South Africa, the eventual winners, in the quarter-finals by a margin of one point.

==History==
Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by English merchants and students. On 26 February 1890, a French rugby team recruited from the Janson de Sailly Lyceum defeated an international team at the Bois de Boulogne.

Although France were represented at the 1900 Summer Olympics, their first official test match did not take place until New Year&#x27;s Day 1906, against the New Zealand All Blacks in Paris. France then played intermittently against the Home Nations until they joined them to form the Five Nations tournament in 1910. In 1913 France faced South Africa&#x27;s Springboks for the first time; losing 38–5. France also competed at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics, and on both occasions lost to the United States in the gold medal match.

France were ejected from the Five Nations in 1932 after being accused of professionalism in the French leagues at a time when rugby union was strictly amateur. Forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning streak; winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. France was invited to rejoin the Five Nations in 1939 but did not compete until 1947 as international rugby was suspended during World War II.

French rugby came of age during the 1950s and 1960s: they won their first Five Nations championship and completed a successful tour of South Africa. Their first championship was won in 1954 when they shared the title with England and Wales. France won their first outright Five Nations championship in 1959; they won with two wins, a draw (against England) and a defeat (against Ireland).

France first toured South Africa winning the test series in 1958. The Springboks also visited Paris in 1961, the test was not completed due to onfield fighting among the players. France also toured New Zealand and Australia in 1961 losing both tests against the All Blacks but defeating Australia&#x27;s Wallabies. They won their first Five Nations Grand Slam in 1968 by beating all four other competing teams, and won numerous titles in the following years.
In 1977, France won their second Grand Slam, fielding an unchanged side throughout the tournament and conceding no tries. They also defeated the All Blacks in Toulouse that year, but lost the return match in Paris. On Bastille Day, 1979 they defeated the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time, at Eden Park in Auckland.

In 1981 the French clinched their third Grand Slam; at Twickenham against England. They again completed a Grand Slam in 1987 on the eve of the first Rugby World Cup hosted by Australia and New Zealand. In that tournament they came from behind numerous times to defeat the Wallabies in their semi-final, and faced the All Blacks in final at Eden Park, Auckland; France lost 29–9. They shared the Five Nations with Wales the next year, and also won it in 1989.

France hosted some of the tests during the 1991 World Cup, but were knocked out by England at the Parc des Princes (Paris) in the quarter-finals. France won the Five Nations championship in 1993. In 1994 France won a test series 2–0 in New Zealand. They were knocked out of the 1995 World Cup semi-finals by eventual champions the Springboks, but did win their third place play-off match against England. In November 1995, France played the All Blacks in two tests, winning the first 22–15 at Toulouse and losing the second 37–12 at Paris. France won back-to-back Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998. At the 1999 World Cup they defeated tournament favourites the All Blacks in the semi-finals, but lost to the Wallabies in the final.

The Five Nations Championship was expanded in 2000 to include Italy. In the now Six Nations Championship France won a Grand Slam in 2002. At the 2003 World Cup in Australia they qualified for the semi-finals where they were defeated by eventual champions England. In 2004, they won a second Six Nations Grand Slam, which was followed by a Championship win in 2006 and a successful defence in 2007.

During the opener of the World Cup 2007, Argentina defeated France 17–12. However, after defeating Ireland 25–3, France qualified for the quarter-finals. After defeating the New Zealand All Blacks 20–18, they lost to England 14–9 in the semi-final. France then lost for a second time to Argentina 34–10 in the third-place match. In 2010, France won its ninth Grand Slam.

During the 2011 Rugby World Cup, France defeated Wales 9–8 in the semi-final at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, on 15 October 2011 and in the following week they lost 8–7 to the All Blacks in the final to make it three final defeats.

During the 2015 Rugby World Cup, France lost 62–13 to New Zealand in the quarter-finals.

In the 2019 Rugby World Cup, France lost to Wales 20–19 in the quarter-finals.

The French rugby team recorded a perfect season in 2022, having won all 13 matches.

During France&#x27;s home 2023 Rugby World Cup, they lost to South Africa, the eventual victors, 28–29 in the quarter-finals.

==Team image==
===Colours and kits===

Until 1912, the strip (uniform) of the French team was white with two rings (the symbol of USFSA, the body that ruled the sport in France by then). After the first game won by France against Scotland in 1911, France&#x27;s captain Marcel Communeau asked that the team adopt the (Gallic rooster), historical emblem of France, as its symbol. The Gallic rooster was probably chosen partly because it is considered as a proud and combative animal that can be sometimes aggressive, although it had been used previously as a symbol by French teams – a former association football player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910. The badge was initially white and red, but was altered to a multicoloured, embroidered image after 1945, and has been golden since 1970.

The symbol used by the French rugby team was a great success, and was later adopted by the French delegation at the Olympic Games of 1920 where the rooster was perched on five Olympic rings. The rooster has since become a well-known symbol of French teams. French players are sometimes called &quot;les coqs&quot; and some French supporters have been known to release roosters on the playing field before games.
The French team traditionally played in blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks, the colors of the national flag, and as such were nicknamed &quot;Les Tricolores&quot; (French for &quot;The Tricoloured&quot; or &quot;The Red, White and Blues&quot;). Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as &quot;Les Bleus&quot; (French for &quot;The Blues&quot;), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt with a black and navy gradation, blue shorts and blue socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white shorts and white socks for their away kit.

In 2011, French Rugby Federation (FFR) announced that Adidas would be their new partner for a period of six years, with them taking over production of the France national rugby shirt from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2018.

Led by newly elected president Bernard Laporte, the federation intended on selling the jersey to a sponsor. The FFR announced on 24 January 2017 that they had started the commercialisation of the jersey. In February, it was decided that the jersey would first be used to support France&#x27;s bid for the 2023 World Cup by showing &quot;#France2023&quot; on the front of the kit. In March 2017, the Groupe Altrad showed its support for France&#x27;s bid for the World Cup and the company&#x27;s logo accompanied &quot;#France2023&quot; on the jersey. The group became the first private company in history that appeared on the France national team kits. As of 2017 and France&#x27;s successful bid to host the World Cup, Groupe Altrad signed a contract with the FFR, appearing solely on the jerseys.

In 2017, the FFR announced that Le Coq Sportif would once again be their supplier for a period of six years, with them taking over production of the France national rugby shirt from July 2018 to June 2024. On 28 June 2019, the Federation unveiled a new France Rugby logo which replaced the red and golden rooster and the previous governing body abstract logo. The red and stylised rooster was designed in order to be used as France teams&#x27; crest and FFR badge. A few months before the 2023 World Cup kick-off, incoming FFR president Florian Grill announced Adidas&#x27; return as France&#x27;s kit manufacturer from June 2024.

===Media coverage===
France&#x27;s autumn internationals and Six Nations Championship matches are televised by public free-to-air national broadcaster France Télévisions (especially by the main channel France 2) since 1975. French viewers can therefore follow and see a total of eight France national games without any charges. The summer test matches meanwhile are fairly often televised by pay television channel Canal+ while the World Cup matches are broadcast by private free-to-air TF1. However, TF1 Group, France Télévisions and Groupe M6 announced details of a joint 2023 World Cup coverage, where each game of the tournament will be quite equally aired across three broadcasters. TF1 will broadcast 20 matches including most of the knockout phase and France matches, France 2 will air 10 matches including the France fixture against Namibia while M6 will televise a total of 18 matches.

France matches are also broadcast with full commentary on many public and private radio stations such as RMC, Sud Radio or local generalist France Bleu branchs. Furthermore, most of French daily and weekly newspapers follow the France national team just like sport specialist &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; and especially rugby-focused &quot;Midi Olympique&quot; that is published every Monday and Friday.

As of June 2023, the French Rugby Federation social media (rebranded as &quot;France Rugby&quot;) had more than 800,000 followers on Facebook and Twitter, and over 700,000 on Instagram. &quot;France Rugby&quot; also posts videos of trainings and game weeks on its YouTube channel, where viewers can witness the players and staff routine in web series.

==Home grounds==

Historically, France played internationals at venues such as the Parc des Princes and the Stade Olympique de Colombes, both in Paris. The Stade Olympique de Colombes was the main venue for the 1924 Summer Olympics, where rugby was a sport.

Ever since moving out of Parc des Princes at the end of 1997, France&#x27;s main home venue has been the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, where their home Six Nations matches are played. It has a capacity of 80,000. Since 2005, France has also played home internationals at the following venues around the country: Stade Chaban-Delmas, Grand Stade Lille Métropole (now known as Stade Pierre-Mauroy), Stade Gerland, Stade Vélodrome, Stade de la Mosson, Stade de la Beaujoire, Stade Bonal, Stadium Municipal (Toulouse) and U Arena.

In June 2012, the FFR announced that plans were under way for a new rugby-dedicated stadium to be constructed in Évry, south of Paris. The stadium was projected to cost €600M and have a seating capacity of 82,000. It was originally scheduled for completion by 2017, but later delayed to 2021 or 2022. In December 2016, FFR officially abandoned the stadium project.

===World Cup venues===
During the 1991 World Cup, Pool D (which included France) matches were played throughout France including Béziers, Bayonne, Grenoble, Toulouse, Brive and Agen. Parc des Princes and Stadium Lille Métropole also hosted a quarter-final each. Pool C fixtures at the 1999 World Cup were played throughout France in Béziers, Bordeaux and Toulouse. A second round match was held at Stade Félix Bollaert, and one quarter final was held at the Stade de France, both 2007 venues.

For the 2007 World Cup, France was the primary host, and there were ten venues used for matches throughout the country (Cardiff in Wales and Edinburgh in Scotland also hosted some games). The French cities that hosted matches were Bordeaux (Stade Chaban-Delmas), Lens (Stade Félix Bollaert), Lyon (Stade Gerland), Marseille (Stade Vélodrome), Montpellier (Stade de la Mosson), Nantes (Stade de la Beaujoire), Paris (Stade de France, Saint-Denis and Parc des Princes), Saint-Étienne (Stade Geoffroy-Guichard), and Toulouse (Stadium de Toulouse). The final between England and South Africa was played at Stade de France.

France was again chosen to host in 2023. After a first choice of twelve venues, nine cities and stadiums were eventually selected for the tournament including five that were already used for the 2007 edition: biggest France stadium Stade de France (Saint-Denis – Paris), Stade Vélodrome (Marseille), OL Stadium (Décines-Charpieu – Lyon), Stade Pierre-Mauroy (Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq – Lille), Stade de Bordeaux, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard (Saint-Étienne) as well as Stade de Nice, Stade de la Beaujoire (Nantes) and Stadium de Toulouse. France will play matches at Stade de France, Stade Pierre-Mauroy, Stade Vélodrome and OL Stadium. Their opening match against New Zealand will be held at Stade France like both semi-finals and finals. 

==Competitive record==
===Six Nations===
France competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations. France were expelled from the tournament due to rumours of professionalism in the then-amateur sport in 1932, but rejoined in 1947. They first won the competition in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the following season, and won it outright for the first time in 1959. France&#x27;s longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910–1954). The Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy is also contested between France and Italy during the Six Nations. Over the whole history of the Tournament, they are the third most-winning nation, eleven wins behind England. However, it should be taken into account that France have been present in 34 fewer tournaments than the Home Nations. France has won almost exactly the same proportion of Six Nations Tournaments in which it has competed as England, and is the most successful nation in the post-World War II era (1945–present).

===Rugby World Cup===

The French have competed at every World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. Although they have yet to win a World Cup, they have participated in the play-off stage of every tournament, and have reached the final three times.

In 1987, France took on pre-tournament favourites Australia at Concord Oval for a place in the final. In one of the greatest World Cup matches, the Australians appeared to be in control, leading 9–0, 15–12 and 24–21 at various stages of the match, only for the French to keep coming back. With the scores locked at 24–24 and the prospect of extra time looming, the French scored one of the most memorable tries in rugby history. Starting an attack from inside their own half, the French passed the ball through 11 pairs of hands before fullback Serge Blanco beat Wallabies hooker Tom Lawton to score a try in the corner. France won 30–24, and would face co-hosts New Zealand in the final at Eden Park. The French had not fully recovered from their magnificent effort in the semi-final, and New Zealand won the anticlimactic decider 29–9.

In 1991, France met eternal arch-rivals England in the quarterfinal at Parc des Princes. Earlier in the year at Twickenham the two sides had played off for the Five Nations Grand Slam. The French scored three magnificent tries but were denied by the fearsome English forward pack. In a very tense and brutally physical match, the scores were tied at 10-all when the French were awarded a scrum five metres out from the tryline. French number eight Marc Cecillon looked set to score the try that would have won the game for the French. Suddenly he was hit and driven back in a tackle from opponent Mick Skinner, a tackle which changed the momentum of the match. England went on to win 19–10 and eventually reached the Final. At the end of the match, France coach Daniel Dubroca angrily assaulted New Zealand referee Dave Bishop in the players tunnel. He resigned soon afterwards.

In 1995, France finished third overall, defeating England 19–9 in the third-place play-off after their defeat to South Africa in the semi-finals. After coming from behind to defeat the All Blacks in their 1999 semi-final, France lost to Australia 35–12 in the final. In 2003 they finished fourth, losing the third/fourth place game to the All Blacks. At the World Cup 2007, after defeating New Zealand 20–18 in the quarter-final, France lost out to England in the semi-finals losing 14–9 after finishing the break 5–6 ahead. France lost to Argentina in the bronze final to finish the tournament fourth.

France&#x27;s 2011 campaign was marked by turmoil within the camp; reports before the tournament indicated as many as 25 of the 30-member squad had turned against head coach Marc Lièvremont. In pool play, France had unimpressive wins over Japan and Canada, an expected loss to New Zealand, and a shock loss to Tonga. During this stage, Lièvremont heavily criticized the team in the media, further angering many of his players, with veteran back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy publicly critical of Lièvremont. Despite the losses, they qualified for the knockout stage. At this time, the players effectively rebelled against Lièvremont; after the tournament, Harinordoquy would tell the French rugby publication &quot;Midi Olympique&quot;, &quot;We had to free ourselves from his supervision.&quot; The team responded by defeating England 19–12 in the quarter-final and controversially beating Wales 9–8 in the semi-final after Welsh captain Sam Warburton was sent off. The French proved admirable opponents in the final, however, losing out to New Zealand 8–7 to finish second for the third time in a Rugby World Cup.

France are the third-highest World Cup points scorers of all time, with 1585 points. They are also the third-highest try scorers, and the second-highest penalty scorers. France&#x27;s Thierry Lacroix was the top points scorer at the 1995 tournament with 112 points, and Jean-Baptiste Lafond was the joint top try scorer in 1991 with six tries (equal with David Campese). Vincent Clerc is top try scorer in 2011 with six tries as Jean-Baptiste Lafond 20 years earlier.
===Overall and rankings===

France were named World Rugby Team of the Year in 2002. When the World Rankings were introduced by World Rugby (then the International Rugby Board) in 2003, France were ranked fifth. During November 2003 France briefly occupied third place before falling to fourth by December that year. After falling to fifth during November 2004, France rose again to fourth by April 2005. During early 2006, France rose again, peaking at second in July that year. France were ranked number two in the world until falling to third in June 2007 after two successive defeats to the All Blacks. They then fell to fifth after losing to Argentina in the opening match of the 2007 World Cup.

For the first time, France became world number one in July 2022.

France have won 458 of their 826 test matches.

Below is a table of the representative rugby matches played by a France national XV at test level up until 12 February 2025.

==Coaching staff==
===Coaching and management history===

Only official competitive and test matches are counted.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Includes a cancelled 2019 World Cup match against England awarded as a 0–0 draw and a cancelled Autumn Nations Cup fixture against Fiji awarded as a 28–0 win.&quot; 

Historically the role of France rugby union head coach has varied considerably. Due to the status of rugby union as an amateur sport for most of its history, the job of deciding tactics and running team trainings has often been that of the captain or senior players. Therefore, a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible. The very first entitled head coach is former legend Jean Prat who won the 1967 Five Nations Championship as a manager before leaving the team before the summer tour of South Africa a few weeks later. Next year, France then won the Grand Slam in the 1968 edition without having a head coach, in self-management. Later that year, Fernand Cazenave took his duties. Two years after, he shared the 1970 Five Nations Championship win with Wales. 

Although coached by Jean Desclaux between 1973 and 1980, the French team&#x27;s main influence during the late 1970 was captain Jacques Fouroux. Fouroux played scrum-half and captained France to their 1977 Five Nations Grand Slam, during which France played a very forward-oriented style of rugby. Although the style of &quot;Fouroux&#x27;s Gang&quot; was successful, it was criticised because it contrasted with the traditional open attacking style of French rugby. Fouroux was given the nickname &quot;the little Corporal&quot; – the same as Napoleon Bonaparte. Fouroux was named as Desclaux&#x27;s successor in 1981 at the age of just 33. He continued to promote a forward-oriented style of play, and France won six Five Nations titles – including two Grand Slams – while he was coach. After nearly ten years in the role he resigned in 1990 after a defeat to Romania.

Fouroux was succeeded by Daniel Dubroca, who coached the team to the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca&#x27;s tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he resigned after violently confronting referee Dave Bishop following France&#x27;s World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier&#x27;s replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France&#x27;s loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela&#x27;s successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-André turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc Lièvremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. Lièvremont&#x27;s tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. But there was also a 59–16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22–21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19–14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, before the World Cup, it was announced that Philippe Saint-André would replace Lièvremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This came as no surprise to Lièvremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.

France did not impress under Saint-André, finishing no higher than fourth in the Six Nations during his tenure and even claiming the wooden spoon in 2013. Following the 2015 Six Nations, he announced his resignation effective after that year&#x27;s World Cup and was replaced by Guy Novès. France was even less impressive under Novès, with &quot;Les Bleus&quot; winning fewer than one-third of their matches during his tenure, capped off by a run of seven winless matches. Novès was dismissed in December 2017, becoming the first France head coach ever to be fired before the end of his contract, and was replaced by former Italy head coach Jacques Brunel, who arrived from the same position with Bordeaux Bègles. Novès&#x27; assistants were dismissed as well.

In April 2019, then-French Rugby Federation president Bernard Laporte announced that Fabien Galthié would be appointed as head coach of the team after the 2019 World Cup. A week later, Jacques Brunel also confirmed that Galthié joined the France management crew as an assistant to prepare the team for the 2019 World Cup. After the World Cup, the federation formalizes the new coaching staff structured around Fabien Galthié. Raphaël Ibañez was appointed general manager of the team along with four staff membres: William Servat and Karim Ghezal as forwards coaches; Laurent Labit as backs coach and Englishman Shaun Edwards, responsible for the defense. Thibault Giroud, former Toulon head of physical training where he worked with Galthié, was also appointed as head of high permormance. Video analyst Nicolas Buffa retained his positions and became the analysis unit director.

After the 2023 World Cup, Ghezal, Labit and Giroud left the France coaching staff and were replaced respectively by Stade Français forwards coach Laurent Sempéré, former international centre Patrick Arlettaz and Nicolas Jeanjean who became head of high performance.

===Selection policy===
In December 2016, when World Rugby was considering a change in the eligibility rules for international selection, FFR president Bernard Laporte announced that the body would require that all France national team members hold French passports. This requirement is in addition to then-current WR rules mandating three years&#x27; residency for international selection, a period which WR increased to five years effective from 31 December 2020. Players who represented France prior to Laporte&#x27;s announcement remained eligible for selection even if they did not hold French passports. Thus, since 2016 France have had the lowest number of foreign-born players in their Six Nations&#x27;s squads.

===Notable players===
Ten former France national team players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame, with an eleventh awaiting induction in 2023. Its direct predecessor is the IRB Hall of Fame, founded in 2006 by the sport&#x27;s international governing body, World Rugby, when it was known as the International Rugby Board. In late 2014, the IRB Hall merged with the separate International Rugby Hall of Fame, with all International Hall inductees becoming members of the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

Marcel Communeau (1885–1971), a back-rower for Stade Français at club level, played in France&#x27;s first official international match against New Zealand&#x27;s Original All Blacks in 1906. He went on to earn 21 caps for France, serving as captain for the country&#x27;s first Five Nations appearance in 1910 and leading France to its first-ever win in that competition in 1911 against Scotland. Communeau is also credited with suggesting that France adopt the rooster as its team emblem. He entered the World Rugby Hall in 2015.

Jean Prat (1923–2005) earned 51 caps playing for France from 1945 to 1955, and captained France to their first wins over Wales and the All Blacks. He was also France&#x27;s captain in 1954 when they won their first ever Five Nations (shared with Wales and England). Prat was inducted to the International Hall of Fame in 2001 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2011.

Lucien Mias (1930–2024), nicknamed &quot;Docteur Pack&quot;, was credited with inventing the concept of the advantage line in forward play. When inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2011, he was called &quot;one of the most influential captains of his country&quot;. He was most noted for captaining France to a Test series win over South Africa in 1958, the first such feat in the 20th century for a touring team.

André Boniface (1934–2024) also played in France&#x27;s win over the All Blacks in 1954; it was only his second test for France. Boniface went on to play 48 tests for France before retiring in 1966. He was inducted to the International Hall in 2005 and the IRB Hall in 2011.

Guy Boniface (1937–1968) emerged on the international scene shortly after his older brother André, although the two did not play together in the same France side until 1961. According to the IRB, the Boniface brothers &quot;redefined the concept of back play through their unique blend of skill and creativity.&quot; Guy won 35 caps for France before his death in an auto accident in 1968. He was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame alongside his brother in 2011.

Jo Maso (born 1944) first played for France between 1966 and 1973; mainly at centre. He played in France&#x27;s first ever Five Nations Grand Slam in 1968, and that year toured New Zealand and Australia. He represented France in 25 tests and also played for the Barbarians and the World XV that beat England in 1971. Maso entered the International Hall in 2003 and became a member of the World Rugby Hall with the merger of the two halls of fame. He is now the manager of the France national team.

Jean-Pierre Rives (born 1952), a 1997 inductee of the International Hall who entered the World Rugby Hall with the merger, played 59 tests for France between 1975 and 1984; including 34 as captain. He played in Five Nations Grand Slams in 1977 and 1981, and captained France to their first ever win over the All Blacks in New Zealand. Rives is now a sculptor, and designed the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy (Italian: Trofeo Garibaldi; French: Trophée Garibaldi), which is competed for every year by France and Italy in the 6 Nations championship.

Serge Blanco (born 1958) played in 93 tests for France between 1980 and 1991. Playing at fullback Blanco won Five Nations Grand Slams with France in 1981 and 1987, and scored the match-winning try in France&#x27;s semi-final against Australia in the 1987 World Cup. He is past president both of his longtime club, Biarritz Olympique, and France&#x27;s national professional league, Ligue Nationale de Rugby. Blanco was inducted to the International Hall in 1997 and the IRB Hall in 2011.

Centre Philippe Sella (born 1962), who was also in the 1987 team, played 111 times for France between 1982 and 1995, setting an appearances record that stood until Fabien Pelous, who himself would be indicted into the World Rugby Hall in 2017, broke it during the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In 1986, he achieved the rare feat of scoring a try in each of France&#x27;s Five Nations matches. Sella entered the International Hall in 1999 and the IRB Hall in 2005.

Lock Fabien Pelous (born 1973) was inducted into the World Rugby Hall in 2017 at a ceremony at the Hall&#x27;s physical location in Rugby. He appeared 118 times for France from 1995 to 2007, surpassing Sella as France&#x27;s most-capped player. According to World Rugby, &quot;Pelous&#x27; spirit and robustness in the heat of battle made him perfect captaincy material&quot;, and he would captain &quot;Les Bleus&quot; 42 times, with only Thierry Dusautoir serving as captain on more occasions. In his 18-season club career, 12 of which were with his hometown club Toulouse, he helped Toulouse to two European and three French titles.

Flanker Thierry Dusautoir (born 1981) was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2023 at the World Rugby Awards ceremony in Paris. Appearing 80 times for France, 56 as captain, from 2006 to 2015, he played in three World Cups. Two of his greatest personal accolades came in World Cup matches against New Zealand—he was Player of the Match in France&#x27;s losing effort in the 2011 World Cup final, and set a World Cup record of 38 tackles in France&#x27;s win in the 2007 World Cup quarterfinals. At club level, he played on teams that won five French titles and one European Cup.

<doc id="955668" wikidata="Q5306794" url="?curid=955668" title="Dreamwatch">
<text>Dreamwatch was a British magazine covering science fiction and fantasy films, books and television programmes.

Published monthly by Gary Leigh (July 1983 to January 2001) and then Titan Magazines (2001 to 2007), it was a leading genre entertainment magazine, competing with &quot;SFX&quot; and &quot;Cinescape&quot; in the genre magazine market.

==Overview==
The publication began life in July 1983 as an amateur fanzine dedicated to the popular science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and was published under the title &quot;Doctor Who Bulletin&quot;. In this form, it became well known for taking a generally critical tone towards the later seasons of the programme, particularly the work of producer John Nathan-Turner, who was subjected to several personal attacks within its pages. 

Nevertheless, the publication became popular with some fans due to both its general attitude and its frequent reporting of news concerning the show before it was released through official sources, such as the officially sanctioned &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; or &quot;Celestial Toyroom&quot;, the newsletter of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society. 

The fanzine also gained a reputation for being sometimes too willing to report rumour as fact. For example, they published an obituary for actor Kevin Stoney in 1986; Stoney, who was very much still alive, would go on to happily sign copies of the obituary for fans at conventions.

In 1989, the fanzine expanded to cover other genre films and television series as well as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and, as a consequence, the title was changed to &quot;DreamWatch Bulletin&quot; in order that the popular (and graphically appealing) abbreviation &quot;dwb&quot; would remain intact. In 1994, the zine was relaunched as a fully professional newsstand magazine: the title was shortened to simply &quot;Dreamwatch&quot;, and the numbering of the magazine was restarted from issue 1.

The original fanzine was founded and edited by Gary Levy, who later changed his surname to Leigh. He edited the first hundred issues, before handing over editorial reins first to David Gibbs (issues 101–110) and then to Anthony Brown (111–130), after which the professional version was launched (with numbering beginning again at issue 1, and with Anthony Clark and then Paul Simpson as editors until issue 71). Leigh returned as editor with issue 72, aided by co-editor Simon J. Gerard who worked on the title on a day-to-day basis. Leigh retained ownership of the title until 2001, when he sold the magazine to Titan Magazines, part of the Titan Entertainment Group owned by Nick Landau. Gerard moved across to Titan with &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; and took the role of Contributing Editor. 

Brian J. Robb became Editor/Managing Editor in June 2001 (issue 81) and continued through to September 2003 (issue 108) which marked &quot;DWB&quot;″s 20th continuous year of publication. Former Deputy Editor David Bassom served as Editor from issue 109 to 123, and launched the stand-alone US edition with the help of Deputy Editor Matthew Chapman. Robb became Editor/Managing Editor of &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; once more from January 2005 (issue 124) until October 2006 (issue 145). Former deputy editor Richard Matthews then became editor for a few issues (until issue 148) before the editorship returned to Robb until issue 150, which was the last print edition, published on 25 January 2007 (issue 280 if counted from the debut issue in July 1983).

At the end of January 2007, the magazine became a web-only publication entitled Total Sci-Fi, offering SF news and features and &quot;Dreamwatch&quot;/&quot;DWB&quot; archive at www.totalscifionline.com. The website was edited by Matt McAllister, and counted many former &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; writers among its contributors. It was placed on indefinite hiatus in 2011.

<doc id="955672" wikidata="Q1149757" url="?curid=955672" title="IEEE 802.16">
<text>IEEE 802.16 is a series of wireless broadband standards written by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE Standards Board established a working group in 1999 to develop standards for broadband for wireless metropolitan area networks. The Workgroup is a unit of the IEEE 802 local area network and metropolitan area network standards committee.

Although the 802.16 family of standards is officially called WirelessMAN in IEEE, it has been commercialized under the name &quot;WiMAX&quot; (from &quot;Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access&quot;) by the WiMAX Forum industry alliance. The Forum promotes and certifies compatibility and interoperability of products based on the IEEE 802.16 standards.

The 802.16e-2005 amendment was implemented and deployed around the world .
The version IEEE 802.16-2009 was amended by IEEE 802.16j-2009.

==Standards==
Projects publish draft and proposed standards with the letter &quot;P&quot; prefixed. Once a standard is ratified and published, that &quot;P&quot; gets dropped and replaced by a trailing dash and suffix year of publication.

===Projects===

== 802.16e-2005 Technology ==
The 802.16 standard essentially standardizes two aspects of the air interface – the physical layer (PHY) and the media access control (MAC) layer. This section provides an overview of the technology employed in these two layers in the mobile 802.16e specification.

=== PHY ===
802.16e uses scalable OFDMA to carry data, supporting channel bandwidths of between 1.25 MHz and 20 MHz, with up to 2048 subcarriers. It supports adaptive modulation and coding, so that in conditions of good signal, a highly efficient 64 QAM coding scheme is used, whereas when the signal is poorer, a more robust BPSK coding mechanism is used. In intermediate conditions, 16 QAM and QPSK can also be employed. Other PHY features include support for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas in order to provide good non-line-of-sight propagation (NLOS) characteristics (or higher bandwidth) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) for good error correction performance.

Although the standards allow operation in any band from 2 to 66 GHz, mobile operation is best in the lower bands which are also the most crowded, and therefore most expensive.

=== MAC ===
The 802.16 MAC describes a number of &quot;Convergence Sublayers&quot; which describe how wireline technologies such as Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Internet Protocol (IP) are encapsulated on the air interface, and how data is classified, etc. It also describes how secure communications are delivered, by using secure key exchange during authentication, and encryption using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Data Encryption Standard (DES) during data transfer. Further features of the MAC layer include power saving mechanisms (using &quot;sleep mode&quot; and &quot;idle mode&quot;) and handover mechanisms.

A key feature of 802.16 is that it is a connection-oriented technology. The subscriber station (SS) cannot transmit data until it has been allocated a channel by the base station (BS). This allows 802.16e to provide strong support for quality of service (QoS).

==== QoS ====
Quality of service (QoS) in 802.16e is supported by allocating each connection between the SS and the BS (called a &quot;service flow&quot; in 802.16 terminology) to a specific &quot;QoS class&quot;. In 802.16e, there are 5 QoS classes:

The BS and the SS use a service flow with an appropriate QoS class (plus other parameters, such as bandwidth and delay) to ensure that application data receives QoS treatment appropriate to the application.

== Certification ==
Because the IEEE only sets specifications but does not test equipment for compliance with them, the WiMAX Forum runs a certification program wherein members pay for certification. WiMAX certification by this group is intended to guarantee compliance with the standard and interoperability with equipment from other manufacturers. The mission of the Forum is to promote and certify compatibility and interoperability of broadband wireless products.

<doc id="955673" wikidata="Q192643" url="?curid=955673" title="Aaron Eckhart">
<text>Aaron Edward Eckhart (born March 12, 1968) is an American actor. Born in Cupertino, California, Eckhart moved to the United Kingdom at an early age. He began his acting career by performing in school plays, before moving to Australia for his high school senior year. He left high school without graduating, but earned a diploma through a professional education course, and then graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film.

As an undergraduate at BYU, Eckhart met director and writer Neil LaBute, who cast Eckhart in several of LaBute&#x27;s original plays. Five years later Eckhart made a debut as an unctuous, sociopathic womanizer in LaBute&#x27;s black comedy film &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; (1997), followed by appearances in three more of the director&#x27;s films.

Eckhart gained wide recognition as George in &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000), and, in 2006, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of Nick Naylor in &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;. In 2008 he played a major role in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s blockbuster Batman film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; as District Attorney Harvey Dent / Two-Face.

He went on to appear in &quot;Love Happens&quot;, &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;, &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; and its sequel, &quot;I, Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Sully&quot;, and &quot;Midway&quot;.

==Early life==
Eckhart was born on March 12, 1968 in Cupertino, California, the son of Mary Martha Lawrence, a writer, artist, and poet, and James Conrad Eckhart, a computer executive. He is the youngest of three brothers. His father is of German-Russian descent, while his mother has English, German, Scots-Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and served a two-year mission in France and Switzerland. Eckhart&#x27;s family relocated to the United Kingdom in 1981, following his father&#x27;s job in information technology. During their time in the United Kingdom, the family moved around Surrey, England, living in towns such as Cobham, Ripley, and Walton-on-Thames. Eckhart attended American Community School, where he was first introduced to acting, starring in a school production as Charlie Brown.

In 1985, Eckhart moved to Australia and settled in Sydney, where he attended American International School of Sydney for his high school senior year; he further developed his acting skills in productions like &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, where he admits that he gave a &quot;terrible&quot; performance. In the autumn of his senior year, Eckhart left school to take a job at the Warringah Mall movie theater. He eventually earned his diploma through a professional education course. This also allowed Eckhart time to enjoy a year of surfing in Hawaii and France, as well as skiing in the Alps. In 1988, Eckhart returned to the United States and enrolled as a film major at Brigham Young University–Hawaii, but later transferred to Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He also studied acting at the William Esper Studio.

==Career==
===Early work===
While at Brigham Young University, Eckhart appeared in the Mormon-themed film &quot;Godly Sorrow&quot;, and the role marked his professional debut. At this time he met director/writer Neil LaBute, who cast Eckhart in several of LaBute&#x27;s original plays. After graduating from BYU, Eckhart moved to New York City, acquired an agent, and took various occasional jobs, including bartending, bus driving, and construction work. His first television roles were in commercials. In 1994, he appeared as an extra on the television drama series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Eckhart followed this small part with roles in documentary re-enactments (&quot;Ancient Secrets of the Bible: Samson&quot;), made-for-television movies, and short-lived programs like &quot;Aliens in the Family&quot;.

In 1997, Eckhart was approached by Neil LaBute to star in a film adaptation of LaBute&#x27;s stage play &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;. He played a frustrated white-collar worker who planned to woo a deaf office worker, gain her affections, then suddenly dump her. The film, his first feature to reach theaters, was critically well received, with Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporting that Eckhart is the &quot;movie&#x27;s most malignant presence&quot; and that he &quot;is in chilling command as a sort of satanic prince in shirtsleeves&quot;. &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; was a critical success, winning Best First Film for LaBute at the 63rd annual New York Film Critics Circle Awards. His performance won him the Independent Spirit Award in the category of Best Debut Performance. The film was ranked as one of &quot;The 25 Most Dangerous Movies&quot; by &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine.

The following year Eckhart starred in another LaBute feature, &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; (1998), as Barry, a sexually frustrated husband in a dysfunctional marriage. For the role Eckhart was required to gain weight. In 1999, he starred opposite Elisabeth Shue in &quot;Molly&quot;, a romantic comedy-drama in which he played the self-absorbed brother of an autistic woman who was cured by surgery. Eckhart also starred that year as a football coach, an offensive coordinator in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;.

===Critical success===
Eckhart first gained wide exposure in 2000 as George, a ponytailed, goateed biker, in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s drama &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;. The film was met with good reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256 million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart &quot;may be playing a bit of an ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in &#x27;In the Company of Men&#x27;.&quot; In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. &quot;I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn&#x27;t a vacation. Sure, I didn&#x27;t earn any money for nine months, but every day I was reading scripts, I was producing my own material, I was taking meetings, I was working on my craft.&quot;
Following the release of &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, Eckhart co-starred with Renée Zellweger in LaBute&#x27;s &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; (2000). He next appeared in Sean Penn&#x27;s mystery feature &quot;The Pledge&quot; (2001), in which he played a young detective partnered with a veteran detective, played by Jack Nicholson. The movie received generally favorable reviews, but it did not fare particularly well at the box office. The following year, he collaborated with LaBute in a film adaptation of the Man Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;Possession&quot; (2002). In 2003, Eckhart co-starred with Hilary Swank in &quot;The Core&quot;, a film about a geophysicist who tries to detonate a nuclear device in order to save the world from destruction. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Also in 2003, he appeared in &quot;The Missing&quot;, in which he played Cate Blanchett&#x27;s lover, and in the action-thriller &quot;Paycheck&quot; opposite Ben Affleck. &quot;Paycheck&quot;, based on a short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, garnered generally negative reception. Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars (out of four), saying that he &quot;enjoyed the movie&quot; but felt that it &quot;exploits [Dick&#x27;s story] for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it.&quot;

The following year, away from film, Eckhart guest starred in two episodes of NBC&#x27;s comedy sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, where he played a boyfriend of Charlotte, Dr. Frasier Crane&#x27;s love interest. His next film role was in E. Elias Merhige&#x27;s thriller &quot;Suspect Zero&quot;, a movie about an FBI agent who tracks down a killer who murders serial killers. Upon release, the movie received broadly negative reviews. Despite the reception, Eckhart&#x27;s performance was favored by critics; &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that Eckhart was a &quot;classically handsome leading man ... but Merhige demands of him complexity and anguish.&quot; &quot;Suspect Zero&quot; was a box office disappointment, earning $11 million worldwide. Also in 2004, Eckhart starred on the London stage, opposite Julia Stiles, in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Oleanna&quot; at the Garrick Theatre. The drama ran until mid-2004. For this performance, Eckhart received favorable critical reviews. In 2005, returning to film, Eckhart appeared in &quot;Neverwas&quot; as a therapist who takes a job at a rundown mental hospital that once treated his father (Nick Nolte). The feature was never given a full theatrical release, eventually being released straight to DVD in 2007.

===Worldwide recognition===
Eckhart&#x27;s next project was &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;, in which he played Nick Naylor, a tobacco lobbyist whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: &quot;You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet do it with a smile on your face and have the audience like you. At one point, I&#x27;m doing a talk show with a kid who&#x27;s dying of cancer, and he&#x27;s going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I&#x27;m the good guy, and I&#x27;m this guy&#x27;s best friend. I mean, it&#x27;s whacked out.&quot; The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that he gave a &quot;standout, whip-smart performance&quot; citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him &quot;likable even in his cynicism.&quot; In the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; review of the film, it was reported that &quot;Under his chummy but compassionless smile&quot; Eckhart radiated charm and &quot;Naylor&#x27;s true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words.&quot;

In this same year, he starred with Helena Bonham Carter in &quot;Conversations with Other Women&quot; (2006). While promoting this film, Eckhart revealed that he wishes not to be typecast or repeat himself, saying he does not want to play any more villains. He appeared in the 2006 film noir &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;—based on a real 1947 crime—as Sergeant Leland &quot;Lee&quot; Blanchard, a detective investigating the murder of Elizabeth Short, later dubbed the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot;. The film premiered at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival. Reception for the movie was mixed, but many critics enjoyed Eckhart&#x27;s performance; &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine praised Eckhart and co-star Hilary Swank for their performances, writing &quot;...both [are] great in their secondary roles.&quot;
Internationally viewed as a sex symbol, he was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Beautiful People in 2006. The following year, Eckhart was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He starred in &quot;No Reservations&quot; (2007), a remake of the 2001 German romantic comedy &quot;Mostly Martha&quot;. He starred opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones as an up-and-coming hotshot chef. The film was met with mixed reviews and was unfavorably compared to the original film. Eckhart starred in the 2008 comedy &quot;Meet Bill&quot;, in which he played the eponymous character, a sad executive working at his father-in-law&#x27;s bank. He gained 30 pounds and donned a fat suit for the role.
Also in 2008, Eckhart portrayed the comic book character Harvey Dent in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, the sequel to the 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. Nolan&#x27;s decision to cast Eckhart was based on his portrayal of corrupt characters in the films &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;, &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, and &quot;Thank You For Smoking&quot;. He noted in his depiction of the character that &quot;[he] is still true to himself. He&#x27;s a crime fighter, he&#x27;s not killing good people. He&#x27;s not a bad guy, not purely&quot;, while admitting &quot;I&#x27;m interested in good guys gone wrong.&quot; &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; was a big financial and critical success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $1 billion worldwide, it became the fourth highest-grossing film of all time, and the highest-grossing film of Eckhart&#x27;s career. Roger Ebert opined that Eckhart did an &quot;especially good job&quot; as his character in the feature, while &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine also enjoyed his performance, noting that he &quot;makes you believe in his ill-fated ambition ... of morphing into the conniving Two-Face.&quot;

Following the success of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Eckhart next appeared in Alan Ball&#x27;s &quot;Towelhead&quot; (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name &quot;Nothing is Private&quot; at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: &quot;Those were difficult times ... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer [Bishil], and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We&#x27;d really rehearse them mechanically, and I&#x27;d say, &#x27;OK, I&#x27;m going to put my hand here, I&#x27;m going to do this.&#x27; ... I think I found it more difficult.&quot; &quot;Towelhead&quot; was critically and financially unsuccessful.

He next co-starred with Jennifer Aniston in the romantic drama &quot;Love Happens&quot;, released in September 2009, as a motivational speaker coming to terms with his own grief. The movie received ambivalent reviews, with a contributor of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; reporting that Eckhart plays &quot;broken&quot; for the whole movie. The following year he starred alongside Nicole Kidman in &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; (2010), an adaption of David Lindsay-Abaire&#x27;s 2005 drama of the same name. The feature premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2011, Eckhart starred in Jonathan Liebesman&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;&quot;, in which he portrayed a combat veteran Marine platoon sergeant. The film was set in modern-day Los Angeles during a global alien invasion, and followed a platoon of U.S. Marines who are joined by an Air Force special operations sergeant and some Army infantry soldiers in combat operations against the alien enemy. He appeared alongside Johnny Depp, Richard Jenkins, and Amber Heard in Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s novel adaptation &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;, directed by Bruce Robinson. In the film, Eckhart played Sanderson, a wealthy landowner, who believes everything has a price and introduces Paul Kemp (Depp) to a different standard of living. He starred as a U.S. President who is taken hostage, in the 2013 action thriller &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;, opposite Gerard Butler, and reprised the role in its 2016 sequel &quot;London Has Fallen&quot;.

In 2019, he starred in Roland Emmerich’s blockbuster movie &quot;Midway&quot;, which also starred Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson.

==Personal life==
Eckhart met actress Emily Cline during the filming of &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; and they became engaged, but they separated in 1998. He has always been reluctant to speak about his relationships in interviews. Eckhart dated songwriter and member of SHeDAISY Kristyn Osborn from 2006 to 2007. He appeared in the group&#x27;s video for their song &quot;I&#x27;m Taking the Wheel&quot;.

Eckhart has noted that hypnosis helped him to quit drinking, smoking, and partying, and that he undertakes amateur photography in his spare time.
