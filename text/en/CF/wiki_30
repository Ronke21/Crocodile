<text>The Aermacchi M-346 Master is a family of military twin-engine transonic advanced jet trainers and light combat aircraft. Originally co-developed with Yakovlev as the Yak/AEM-130, the partnership was dissolved in 2000 and then Alenia Aermacchi proceeded to separately develop the M-346 Master, while Yakovlev continued work on the Yakovlev Yak-130. The first flight of the M-346 was performed in 2004. The type is currently operated by the air forces of Italy, Israel, Singapore, Greece, Qatar, Turkmenistan and Poland. Since 2016 the manufacturer became Leonardo-Finmeccanica as Alenia Aermacchi merged into the new Finmeccanica, finally rebranded as Leonardo in 2017.

==Development==
===Background===
In 1992, Aermacchi signed a cooperation agreement with Yakovlev to provide financial and technical support for the new trainer that the firm had been developing since 1991 for the Russian Air Force in competition with the Mikoyan MiG-AT. Aermacchi also gained the right to modify and market the aircraft for the Western market. The resulting aircraft first flew in 1996 and was brought to Italy the following year to replace the aging MB-339. By this point, the aircraft was being marketed as the &quot;Yak/AEM-130&quot;. In February 1996, Russia provided initial funding for the Yak/AEM-130 and pledged to purchase up to 200 aircraft for the Russian Air Force.

In October 1998, it was reported that the venture was increasingly becoming an Italian-led effort due to a lack of financial support on the part of Russia. By July 2000, Aermacchi held a 50% stake in the development programme, and Yakovlev and Sokol had a 25% share each. In mid-2000, it was announced that differences in priorities between the two firms, and a lack of financial backing from the programme&#x27;s Russian participants, had brought about an end to the partnership and that each firm would pursue development of the aircraft independently; Yakovlev received US$77 million for technical documents of the aircraft. Yakovlev would be able to sell the Yak-130 to countries such as those in the Commonwealth of Independent States, India, Slovakia and Algeria, while Aermacchi would be able to sell the M-346 to NATO countries, among others.

The M-346 is a highly modified version of the aircraft that was being developed under the joint venture. It uses equipment exclusively from Western manufacturers, such as the digital flight control system being developed by a collaboration between Teleavio, Marconi Italiana and BAE Systems. In July 2000, Aermacchi selected the Honeywell F124 turbofan engine to power the type in place of the originally intended Lotarev DV-2S powerplant. In 2004, a contract for the development of a full-mission simulator for the M-346 was awarded to CAE. Further production contracts for CAE&#x27;s full-mission simulator have since been issued.

===Into flight===
On 7 June 2003, the first M-346 prototype rolled out; ground testing commenced shortly thereafter. On 15 July 2004, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight.

In January 2005, the Greek Ministry of Defence signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to become a partner in the programme, followed by an industrial cooperation agreement between Aermacchi and Hellenic Aerospace Industry in 2006. In March 2008, the Chilean ENAER signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Alenia Aermacchi at the FIDAE air show.
On 10 April 2008, the first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP-00) aircraft, produced in the final configuration (new landing gear and air brake, more composite parts), was rolled out. On 18 December 2008, Aermacchi announced that the M-346 had attained a maximum speed of Mach 1.15 (1,255 km/h, 678 knots, 780 mph), claiming the occasion to be the first in which an all-Italian built aircraft had broken the sound barrier in 50 years.

In May 2008, Boeing signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on the marketing, sales, training and support of two Aermacchi trainer aircraft, the M-346 and the M-311.

On 20 June 2011, a Military Type Certification was granted to Alenia Aermacchi for the M-346 Master by the General Directorate for Aeronautical Armaments of the Italian Ministry of Defence in Rome. Throughout the certification process, the M-346 development aircraft made 180 test flights, totalling 200 flights across the course of the previous five months, during which over 3,300 test points were completed.

===Further development===
In the advanced jet trainer role, the original M-346 model is unarmed; however, in November 2015, it was reported that Alenia Aermacchi was close to finalising a combat-capable dual-role variant of the aircraft. During late 2017, a series of armed tests involving the AIM-9L missiles took place. In 2015, an armed variant, designated as the M-346 LCA (Light Combat Aircraft), was offered to Poland; this reportedly included a capability of operating the Brimstone air-to-ground missile.

The armed variant is under development, designated M-346FA. The first pre-series aircraft has flown from Venegono airfield in July 2020.

In February 2016, the newly created, consolidated Leonardo-Finmeccanica company promoted the Aermacchi M346 in two new roles: companion training and dissimilar air combat training. In order to better replicate the flight performance and behavior of various enemy aircraft, both the g-force and angle of attack can be independently selected in the flight control system; reportedly, existing customers have stated the type to be well suited to the aggressor role. Leonardo has offered the M-346 for Companion Training and Adversary/Red Air roles.

In January 2021, Israeli and Greece ministers of defence announced plans to establish a wide-ranging $1.68 billion security agreement that include the procurement of 10 M-346 aircraft and the establishment and operation of a flight school for the Hellenic Air Force by Elbit Systems, including provisions for simulators, training and logistic support.

==Design==
The M-346 is designed for the main role of lead-in fighter trainer, in which aircraft&#x27;s performance and capabilities are used to deliver pilot training for the latest generation of combat fighter aircraft. Powered by a pair of Honeywell F124 turbofan dry engines, designed to reduce acquisition and operating costs, it is capable of transonic flight without using an afterburner; Alenia Aermacchi has claimed that the M-346&#x27;s flight performance to be &quot;second only to afterburner-equipped aircraft&quot;. During the design process, the twin concepts of &quot;design-to-cost&quot; and &quot;design-to-maintain&quot; were adhered to, reducing acquisition and operational costs; the per flying hour costs of the M346 are reportedly one-tenth of those of the Eurofighter Typhoon. Outside of the training role, the M-346 was designed from the onset to accommodate additional operational capabilities, including combat missions such as close air support and air policing duties.

The M-346 incorporates a full-authority quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system which, in combination with the optimized aerodynamic configuration of the aircraft, provides for full manoeuvrability and controllability at very high angle of attack (in excess of 30° degrees). The flight control system, incorporating a HOTAS design philosophy, is equipped with adjustable angle of attack and g-force limitations; when combined with its wide performance envelope, this allows the M-346 to effectively mimic the flight performance of various fighter aircraft operated by trainee pilots or to progressively increase difficulty levels, thus raising the training&#x27;s effectiveness. A pilot activated recovery system (PARS) is present which, when pressed, conducts an automatic recovery by returning the aircraft to a steady and level flight path.

A digital avionics system, modelled on its counterparts on board the latest generation of military aircraft such as the Saab JAS-39 Gripen, the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and the Eurofighter Typhoon, is incorporated, making it suitable for all stages of advanced flight training and thus reducing the use of combat aircraft for training purposes,”downloading” flight hours from Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) to Pilot Training Unit. A modular avionics architecture is employed, allowing for new equipment and systems to be incorporated and increasing the type&#x27;s growth potential. The M-346&#x27;s glass cockpit is representative of the latest generation cockpit and is compatible with Night Vision Goggles; it has three color LCD multifunctional displays, a head-up display (also in the rear cockpit), and an optional Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD). A voice command system is also present, which is integrated with functions such as the navigation system. The communication systems include VHF/UHF transceivers, IFF transponder, and Mid-air Collision Avoidance System (MIDCAS), and Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS).
A key feature of the M-346 is the Embedded Tactical Training System (ETTS). The ETTS is capable of emulating various equipment, such as radar, targeting pods, weapons, and electronic warfare systems; additionally, the ETTS can interface with various munitions and other equipment actually being carried on board. The system can act in a standalone mode, in which simulated data and scenario information, with threats and targets, is loaded prior to takeoff, or in a network, during which data is received and acted upon in real time from ground monitoring stations via the aircraft&#x27;s datalink. The ETTS can generate realistic Computer Generated Forces (both friend and foe). For post-mission evaluation and analysis purposes, accumulated data, such as video from the optional Helmet Mounted Display, can be extracted and reviewed. Leonardo also offer an Integrated Training System (ITS), combining the M-346 with a Ground-Based Training System (GBTS) - composed of academic training devices, simulators, mission planning and training management systems - and full logistic service as part of a wider syllabus towards qualifying pilots.
The M-346, in the multirole Fighter Attack variant (M-346FA), is equipped with a multi-mode fire-control radar (Grifo M-346 by Leonardo Electronics) and a total of seven hardpoints, it is capable of carrying external loads up to 3,000 kg while maintaining a high thrust-to-weight ratio; stores management data can be presented upon any of the multifunction displays in the cockpit. The radar cross-section of the M346 in a standard configuration is reportedly 20 square meters; this can be reduced to a single square meter by installing a low-observability kit which has been developed for the type. Other self-protection systems that can be fitted include a Defensive-Aids Support System (DASS) which includes Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) and Chaff and Flares Dispensers (C&amp;FD). The high-end, net-centric communication suite of the M-346FA includes secure comms and Tactical Datalink, both NATO and non-NATO.

The combat capable M-346FA can perform ground attack, homeland defence and air policing missions and reconnaissance. Various munitions and stores can be carried, including IRIS-T or AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, various air-to-surface missiles, anti-ship missiles, free-fall and laser-guided bombs and rockets, a 12.7 mm gun pod, reconnaissance and targeting pods, and electronic warfare pods; weapon aiming is performed using the Helmet Mounted Display and the multifunction displays. All main systems are duplicated, and the flight system reconfigurable, to increase survivability and functionality in the event of battle damage being sustained. The aircraft has a maximum range of 1,375 nautical miles when outfitted with a maximum of three external fuel tanks, this can be extended via in-flight refuelling via a removable refuelling probe.

==Operational history==
===Italian Air Force===
In 2007, it was reported that the Italian Air Force intended to initially acquire a batch of 15 low rate production M-346s. On 18 June 2009, Alenia Aermacchi announced they had received an order for the first six with an option for nine more. In September 2015, the Italian Air Force started their first training course using the M-346 trainer. In March 2016, Finmeccanica signed a contract worth over 300 million Euros with the Italian Ministry of Defence for nine M-346, bringing the number of aircraft ordered by Italy to 18.

In February 2018, the Italian Air Force received its 18th M-346, concluding the force&#x27;s acquisition program. In 2019, four more M-346 were delivered to the newly formed Italian Air Force/Leonardo International Flight Training School (IFTS) at Galatina Air Base.

On 12 September 2024, the Italian Air Force&#x27;s aerobatic team Frecce Tricolori unveiled the M-346 as its new aircraft to replace the Aermacchi MB-339-A/PAN, alongside a new livery designed by Pininfarina.

===Singapore Air Force===
In July 2010, the M-346 was selected by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) to replace the ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawks in the Advanced Jet Training (AJT) role, based at BA 120 Cazaux Air Base in France. In a press release by the Singaporean Ministry of Defence on 28 September 2010, ST Aerospace was awarded the contract to acquire twelve M-346 and a ground-based training system on behalf of RSAF. As stipulated in the contract, ST Aerospace acts as the main contractor in the maintenance of the aircraft after delivery by Alenia Aermacchi while Boeing supplies the training system. The RSAF holds the distinction of being the first export customer for the type.

===Israeli Air Force===
On 16 February 2012, the M-346 was selected by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in an exchange deal, in which Israel will build a reconnaissance satellite and AWACs systems for Italy in return for the planes. It will operate as the IAF&#x27;s main training jet to replace the McDonnell Douglas A-4H/N Skyhawk, which has served the IAF for over 40 years. On 19 July 2012, a contract was signed between Alenia Aermacchi and the Israeli Ministry of Defence to supply 30 M-346s, with the first delivery expected in the middle of 2014. The Israeli Air Force announced on 2 July 2013 that in Israeli service the M-346 would be named the &quot;Lavi&quot;, reusing the name given to the cancelled IAI Lavi. The IAF&#x27;s first M-346 was rolled out in a ceremony at Alenia Aermacchi&#x27;s factory in Venegono Superiore on March 20, 2014.

===Polish Air Force===
On 23 December 2013, it was announced that Poland had selected the M-346 to meet a requirement for an advanced jet trainer. A contract for eight aircraft was signed on 27 February 2014. The first two M-346s arrived at Dęblin in November 2016. The aircraft were initially not officially accepted due to non-compliance with contract specifications. The delivery deadline was originally November 2016, but delays meant delivery and acceptance was not complete until 22 December 2017.

In December 2017, Poland&#x27;s Ministry of National Defence announced it was seeking financial penalties from Leonardo of up to 100 million zlotys (U.S. $28 million) over the delays. Additionally, the ministry had complained that the M-346 was not fully capable of simulating certain weapon systems for training purposes. On 19 November 2018, Leonardo&#x27;s Aircraft Division together with Elbit Systems completed delivery of M-346 Full Mission Simulators (FMS) and Flight Training Devices (FTD) to the Polish Air Force (PLAF). This was initially scheduled to be completed by November 2016.

In March 2018, Poland signed for an additional four M-346s and support package, plus options for a further four aircraft, and a support package. In December 2018, Poland signed for the additional four aircraft, as well as upgrades to the existing fleet of eight. Deliveries and upgrade work for the total of 16 M-346 is expected to run into 2022.

On July 12, 2024, a Polish Air Force M-346 Demo Team jet crashed during its flying display near Gdynia. Pilot Maj. Robert “Killer” Jeł lost his life in the crash.

===United States Air Force===
Alenia Aermacchi submitted the M-346 for the United States Air Force&#x27;s T-X program to replace the aging Northrop T-38 Talon, rebranding it as the &quot;Leonardo DRS T-100 Integrated Training System&quot;. Alenia originally intended to be the prime contractor, anticipating moving the final assembly location from Italy to the United States if the bid succeeded. About 350 aircraft were expected to be ordered, with further purchases leading to over 1,000 aircraft being purchased overall. In January 2013, Alenia Aermacchi signed a letter of intent with General Dynamics C4 Systems, who intended to serve as the prime contractor for the T-X bid; however, General Dynamics announced their withdrawal in March 2015. On January 1, 2016, Alenia Aermacchi was absorbed into Leonardo S.p.A. In February 2016, it was announced that Raytheon, which would serve as the prime contractor, had teamed up with Leonardo to offer an advanced variant of the M-346 for the T-X program called the T-100.

On 25 January 2017, Raytheon announced that it had withdrawn as prime contractor and American partner in the T-X competition. One of the sticking points had been price per unit: at the time the M-346 had a flyaway cost of $25 million, but Raytheon wanted Leonardo to reduce that by 30%. On 8 February 2017, Leonardo confirmed that it would remain in the T-X competition alone, with Leonardo DRS, its American subsidiary, serving as prime contractor. In September 2017, it was announced that the T-X program had selected the rival Boeing T-7 Red Hawk submission instead.

===Others===
====Argentina====
In October 2016, the Argentine Air Force also evaluated the M-346 as a potential combat fighter to replace the Dassault Mirage III and Mirage 5 aircraft it had retired in 2015, as well as the Douglas A-4AR aircraft that remain in service with only limited capability. Argentina is speculated to be interested in 10 to 12 aircraft.

====Azerbaijan====
On 20 February 2020, the president of Azerbaijan announced that the country would buy an undisclosed number of M-346s. The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has a requirement to augment and replace its Soviet-era Mikoyan MiG-29, Sukhoi Su-25, and Aero L-39 Albatros jets. The number of aircraft to be purchased is between 10 and 25 (10 plus an option for 15). Azerbaijani military leaders also considered the Yak-130 for the trainer requirement but selected the M-346 despite its higher price because of its lighter weight and higher maneuverability and problems with manufacturing of the engines for Yak-130.

====Brazil====
In July 2024, during the 2024 edition of the Farnborough International Airshow, Leonardo presented and offered to Brazil the new variant Block 20, as a candidate for the Brazilian Air Force&#x27;s process of selection for a light attack jet to replace the older AMX attack jet. The aircraft was evaluated by the MoD minister José Múcio and the air force commander Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno. In November 2024, during the visit to Brazil by the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, she will meet Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to discuss the sale of 24 M-346s to the Brazilian Air Force, other six aircraft to the Brazilian Navy, and other related accords.

====UAE====
The M-346 was named the winner of a competition by the United Arab Emirates at the IDEX 2009 defense show in Abu Dhabi on 25 February 2009. The official said the order involved delivery of 48 aircraft to be used for pilot training and light attack duties. A final request for proposals in 2010 had set the requirement at 20 trainers, 20 aircraft for combat duties, and the remainder would go toward the creation of an aerobatic team. However, by January 2010, negotiations to sign a contract had reportedly stalled over specifications. On 18 November 2011, the prototype, which had been on display at the Dubai Airshow, crashed after departing Dubai on return to Italy.

The Advance European Pilot Training (AEPTJ) program – unofficially called &quot;Eurotraining&quot; – a consortium of 12 European nations to give advance &amp; lead-in fighter training with a common core course and training provided by a common aircraft – has contacted Alenia Aermacchi through the European Defence agency in 2010, for further information on the M-346. In May 2013, Alenia Aermacchi announced that the AEPTJ held a low priority for the firm and that &quot;...progress has been slow.&quot;

On 11 May 2013, an Alenia-operated M-346 crashed near the village of Piana Crixia, in Val Bormida, between the provinces of Cuneo and Savona, Italy, during a test flight. The pilot was able to eject successfully and survived the crash, but received serious injuries after jumping from the tree where his parachute had been entangled. The type was grounded for more than three months while the cause of the crash was investigated.

In July 2021, Leonardo made a submission to the Irish Commission on the Defence Forces presenting the M-346FA as a light multi-role fighter and advanced trainer for the Irish Air Corps. The commission has multiple tasks, including determining the future capability requirements for the Irish Defence Forces. Currently, the Irish Air Corps has a very limited air combat capability with eight Pilatus PC-9M training/light attack aircraft. The M-346FA could be a cheaper alternative to more expensive fighters and would be Ireland&#x27;s first combat jet aircraft since the retirement of the six Fouga CM.170 Magister aircraft in 1999. In comparison to Ireland&#x27;s current air combat capability, the M-346FA would be considered by many to be a step up, introducing features such as air-to-air missiles and onboard radar.

<text>Delancey Street is one of the main thoroughfares of New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side in Manhattan, running from the street&#x27;s western terminus at the Bowery to its eastern end at FDR Drive, connecting to the Williamsburg Bridge and Brooklyn at Clinton Street. It is an eight-lane, median-divided street, which is west of Clinton Street, and a service road for the Williamsburg Bridge east of Clinton Street. West of Bowery, Delancey Street becomes Kenmare Street, which continues as a four-lane, undivided street to Lafayette Street.

Delancey Street is named after James De Lancey Sr., chief justice, lieutenant governor, and acting colonial governor of the Province of New York, whose farm was located in what is now called the Lower East Side. There is also a Delancey Street in Camden Town, London, England, a residential street named after another James Delancey, of Marylebone, who had a number of fields west of the High Street.

Businesses range from delis to check-cashing stores to bars. Delancey Street has long been known for its discount and bargain clothing stores. Famous establishments include the Bowery Ballroom, built in 1929, Ratner&#x27;s kosher restaurant (now closed), and the Essex Street Market, which was built by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia to avoid pushcart congestion on the neighborhood&#x27;s narrow streets.

Until the middle 20th century, Delancey Street was a main shopping street in the predominantly Jewish and Irish Lower East Side. Since the late 2000s, the neighborhood around Delancey is more diverse; including African Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Chinese. Gentrification has brought more upscale retail and nightlife establishments.

==Transportation==
The New York City Subway&#x27;s serve the Delancey Street/Essex Street station, and the also stop at the Bowery station.

Under New York City Bus, the is Delancey Street’s main bus, running between Allen &amp; Clinton Streets. In addition, the run in the westbound direction to Columbia Street, where the former terminates, from the FDR Drive and Lewis Street, respectively (eastbound M21 buses cross on the FDR Drive). The cross on Essex Street, the on Allen Street, and the on Bowery.

The Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal, beneath Delancey and Essex Streets, was a station and balloon loop for streetcars crossing the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn. The Lowline, an underground public park in which natural light would be directed using fiber optics to create a setting in which trees and grass could be grown indoors, was proposed in 2011.

Because Delancey Street is very wide, and because of its high rate of fatalities, safety measures were erected along its length in the 2000s and 2010s. This includes pedestrian plazas, bans on left turns along the street, and pedestrian countdown signals. A protected bike lane was constructed on Delancey Street from Chrystie Street to the Williamsburg Bridge in November 2018, in advance of the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown. In January 2023, city officials received a $21 million grant from the federal government to add bike lanes, widen sidewalks, and reduce vehicular lanes along Delancey Street.

==Kenmare Street==

Kenmare Street extends five blocks from the Bowery to Lafayette Street. It is a major thoroughfare for traffic traveling westbound to the Holland Tunnel. The street was founded in 1911, by Tim Sullivan, the son of immigrants Daniel O’Sullivan and Catherine Connelly, who came from Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland.

<doc id="948498" wikidata="Q1934308" url="?curid=948498" title="Mulberry Street (Manhattan)">
<text>Mulberry Street is a principal thoroughfare in Lower Manhattan, New York City, United States. It is historically associated with Italian-American culture and history, and in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the heart of Manhattan&#x27;s Little Italy.

The street was listed on maps of the area since at least 1755. The &quot;Bend&quot; in Mulberry, where the street changes direction from southeast to northwest to a northerly direction, was made to avoid the wetlands surrounding the Collect Pond. During the period of the American Revolution, Mulberry Street was usually referred to as &quot;Slaughter-house Street&quot;, named for the slaughterhouse of Nicholas Bayard on what is now the southwest corner of Mulberry and Bayard Streets, which was located there until the summer of 1784, when it was ordered to be removed to Corlaer&#x27;s Hook.

Mulberry Bend, formed by Mulberry Street on the east and Orange Street on the west, was historically part of the core of the infamous Five Points; the southwest corner of Mulberry Bend formed part of the Five Points intersection for which the neighborhood was named. Aside from Mulberry, the other four streets forming Five Points were Anthony Street (now Worth Street), Cross Street (now Mosco Street), Orange Street (now Baxter Street), and Little Water Street (which no longer exists).

==Location==
Mulberry is located between Baxter and Mott Streets. It runs north to south, through the centers of Little Australia and Little Italy, parallel to Mott Street one block to the east, is bound on the north by Bleecker Street in NoHo and on the south by Worth Street in the Civic Center. Near the southern portion of Mulberry Street, the street enters Chinatown, where it is lined with Chinese green grocers, butcher stores, and fishmongers.

Further south past Bayard Street, on the west side of the street, lies Columbus Park, which was created in 1897. The southwest corner of the park (away from Mulberry Street) is the site of the original Five Points intersection. The east side of the street is now lined with Chinatown&#x27;s funeral homes.

===Mulberry Bend===

The street was named after the mulberry trees that once lined Mulberry Bend, the slight bend in Mulberry Street. &quot;Mulberry Bend is a narrow bend in Mulberry Street, a tortuous ravine of tall tenement-houses ... so full of people that the throngs going and coming spread off the sidewalk nearly to the middle of the street ... The crowds are in the street because much of the sidewalk and all of the gutter is taken up with vendors&#x27; stands.&quot;

For the urban reformer Jacob Riis, Mulberry Bend epitomized the worst of the city&#x27;s slums: &quot;A Mulberry Bend Alley&quot; contrasted with &quot;Mulberry Bend becomes a park&quot; were two of the photographs illustrating Jacob Riis&#x27;s call for renewal in &quot;The Battle with the Slum&quot; (1902). In response to reformers such as Riis, the city in the 1890s bought out many of the slumlords and replaced tenements with Columbus Park.

===Notable buildings===
The Puck Building stands near the north end of the street on the southwest corner of Houston Street. Further south is Saint Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral, standing in its churchyard. The Church of the Most Precious Blood, at 113 Baxter Street, was built by Italians, who as new immigrants were not allowed to worship in the main Churches of Transfiguration nor St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral. Below Prince Street (no. 247) is the former Ravenite Social Club, where wire taps acquired evidence that sent John Gotti to prison.

The Italian American Museum is at 155 Mulberry and Grand Street in the building that used to house the Italian immigrant bank Banca Stabile.
==Culture==
===Social structure===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; sent its reporters to characterize the Little Italy/Mulberry neighborhood in May 1896:

They are laborers; toilers in all grades of manual work; they are artisans, they are junkman, and here, too, dwell the rag pickers...There is a monster colony of Italians who might be termed the commercial or shop keeping community of the Latins. Here are all sorts of stores, pensions, groceries, fruit emporiums, tailors, shoemakers, wine merchants, importers, musical instrument makers...There are notaries, lawyers, doctors, apothecaries, undertakers... There are more bankers among the Italians than among any other foreigners except the Germans in the city.

===Feast of San Gennaro===
During the Italian-American festival of the Feast of San Gennaro each September, the entire street is blocked off to vehicular traffic for the street fair. The San Gennaro Feast began in 1926 and continues . It is the largest Italian-American Festival in New York and possibly the United States.

==In popular culture==
Manhattan&#x27;s Mulberry Street has been the subject of books, films, and music. For example:

Books
*&quot;The King of Mulberry Street&quot;, by Donna Jo Napoli. A young boy in the 1890s travels alone from Napoli (Naples), Italy to New York, where he settles on Mulberry Street.

Music
*Billy Joel&#x27;s song &quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot; is a jazz-influenced song from his album &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1986).
*Twenty One Pilots&#x27; &quot;Mulberry Street&quot; from their album &quot;Scaled and Icy&quot;.

<doc id="948499" wikidata="Q7660028" url="?curid=948499" title="Sydney MacEwan">
<text>Canon Sydney Alfred MacEwan (19 October 190825 September 1991) was a Scottish tenor, who sang traditional Scottish and Irish songs. His name has also been recorded as Alfred Sydney Marley MacEwan.(Marley was his mother&#x27;s maiden name).

==Early life==

Sydney MacEwan was born and brought up in the Springburn area of Glasgow by his mother after his parents separated. Sydney was the younger of two brothers. His mother was Irish, from the Portadown area, County Armagh, and his father was born in Partick. The family were poor but Sydney&#x27;s mother managed to pay for music lessons for both her sons and both won bursaries to good schools. Sydney attended St Aloysius&#x27; College in Garnethill from 1919 to 1924, before transferring to Hillhead Academy. He also commenced his singing career.

In 1938 MacEwan retired from concert work, and during World War II was an ambulance driver and an RAF chaplain. He was ordained in 1944.

==Catholic priesthood==

At the age of 18, MacEwan entered training to become a Jesuit priest at Manresa House in Roehampton, London. He chose to study at Glasgow University instead. He completed a Master of Arts degree at the university.

Throughout his life MacEwan had retained a love of the Catholic Church and, despite his earlier experience with the Jesuits, chose to abandon his fame and success as a tenor, to enter the Bearsden Seminary in Glasgow before going to Pontifical Scots College in Rome, to follow his vocation to become a priest. He was ordained in St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Glasgow in 1944 and celebrated his first Mass at St Aloysius&#x27; Church.

Combining priesthood and music, he undertook tours of North America and Australia, where those concerts helping to provide funding for the building of St Columba&#x27;s Cathedral in Oban. He helped with funds to renovate the Church of St Margaret&#x27;s in Lochgilphead, in Argyll, where he was parish priest for 17 years.

In the Scottish summer of 1947, MacEwan arranged for Australian and New Zealand food parcels which he distributed around the parish: 
:If these good people could see the poor wee bairns enjoying the contents of the parcels, they would be well rewarded for their great kindness. &quot;It is so heartening to feel that the poor old Mother is being helped in her distress by her young and vigorous children. They have been superb in their charity. God love them all.

When asked in 1948 the clergyman and singer said: 
:Of the two, I think I prefer a concert audience to a congregation. People listen to me more attentively in a concert than in a church.

However it was quite clear his performances were to fund and secondary to his religious duties, where after ordination he decreed all concert earnings went to charities. MacEwan also rejected the title of a &#x27;singing priest&#x27;.

After Lochgilphead, he moved to St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Rothesay. A stained glass window in the church in Lochgilphead is dedicated to the MacEwan family. His parishioners became accustomed to his concert tours, and enjoyed his return each time. He then moved to Malaga for a time, for health reasons, before returning to be parish priest at St Columba&#x27;s in Kingussie.

==Singing career==

While at university, his vocal talents were noticed and he began a singing career on the advice of Sir Compton Mackenzie and Irish tenor John McCormack. At this time he came to the attention of the Scottish region of the British Broadcasting Company, and became heavily involved in many broadcasts, specifically the &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; programme.

He began recording for Parlophone in 1934 while still attending the Royal Academy of Music in London and being tutored by Plunket Greene.

He toured in 1936, playing to audiences in Canada, the United States of America, New Zealand, and Australia, and the tour was repeated in 1938.

Still performing as a priest, MacEwan nonetheless continued to record and tour. Further trips to North America and Australia took place until as late as 1956. At one time he indicated a liking for the style of American crooner Bing Crosby.

===Australian tours===

MacEwan&#x27;s 1936 tour of Australia went as far north as Townsville.

Commencing the 1948 tour in April, MacEwan attended Saint Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney. Before Cardinal Francis Spellman, Archbishop of New York, he celebrated a mass for peace, singing the liturgy there. Arriving in Australia by flying boat, he took the mail train firstly to Melbourne as part of the Centenary of the Catholic Church celebrations. Normally his musical public performances were limited towards charitable causes. The tour was with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, with six public performances and eighteen studio recitals in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, and Melbourne. He travelled as far as the town of Bowen, Queensland, to see North Queensland and to &#x27;have a surf before the winter set in&#x27;, delivering a benediction to a large congregation there.

MacEwan&#x27;s June to October 1951 Australian tour included concerts in Western Australia. Arriving by sea on the &quot;SS Oransay&quot; in mid-June, he struck down with influenza and was unable to perform in that State and also at Adelaide. It was considered he would be unable to fulfil any singing obligations for the ABC. The money of &#x27;thousands of pounds&#x27; raised was going to build the memorial chapel at the Oban Catholic Cathedral, &#x27;be dedicated to the Scottish and Australian soldiers who fell in the Second World War&#x27;. At the time his Melbourne attendance with the ABC was also the highest paid fee for a visiting singer.

==Later years==

He was featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; programme in October 1962 and his autobiography, &quot;On the High C&#x27;s&quot;, was published in 1973.

MacEwan died in September 1991, aged 82. His funeral was held in St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, the church where he was ordained. He was survived by a brother.

In Ireland on the first day of May each year, the hymn &quot;Bring flowers of the rarest&quot;, also known as &quot;Queen of the May&quot;, sung by MacEwan is played over the radio.

==Discography==

MacEwan&#x27;s tenor voice was captured in 39 record albums, singles, and EPs. It includes:

* &quot;Songs of Scotland and Ireland&quot;, sung by Father Sydney MacEwan with orchestra conducted by Philip Green. The Columbia record (330S 1073) was recorded in Australia circ 1950. The rear cover note was written by Mervyn Douglas. Side 1 songs were Scotland the brave, My ain folk, Bonnie Mary of Argylle, The road to the Isles, and Loch Lomond. Side 2 songs were The star of County Down, Mother Machree, Killarney in the Spring, The youth of the heart, and Rose of Killarney.

In 1956-57 Columbia released his LP &quot;Christmas Carols&quot; (CL 924). Neither the organist nor the choir who accompany him are identified in the liner notes. The album includes a rendition of Michael Head&#x27;s &quot;The Three Mummers&quot; (a modern carol recently recorded by Anne Sofie von Otter and Bengt Forsberg).

<text>Kalka is a town in the Panchkula district of Haryana, India. It is near Panchkula city. The name of the town is derived from the Hindu goddess Kali. Kalka is situated in the foothills of the Himalayas and is a gateway to the neighbouring state of Himachal Pradesh; it is located on the National Highway 5 between Chandigarh and Shimla, and it is the terminus of the Kalka-Shimla Railway. To the south of Kalka is Pinjore, and the industrial village of Parwanoo (Himachal Pradesh) is to the north on NH 22. Railways and Industrial development have led to a continuous urban belt from Pinjore to Parwanoo, but Kalka gained major economic benefits due to being the only highway destination until 2010 from Shimla. It is the tehsil of 253 nearby sub-villages. Nearby is Chandimandir Cantonment, where the Western Command of the Indian army is based. In 2013, the municipal committee of Kalka was dissolved and the administration was reassigned to Panchkula Municipal Corporation.

==History==
The town takes its name from Kalika Maa the ruling deity. Kalka was acquired by British India from the Princely state of Patiala in 1843 as a stopover and depot for the Simla, the summer capital of the Raj. In 1846, it was transferred to the Shimla district and in 1899 to the Ambala district.
The main center part was established by Pundir Rajputs of Haryana and the area was under them and this town was governed by local Rajputi zamindars. In the 1800s, the British occupied the land from local zamindars for rail development, which led to an economic boost for the town.
It became the junction for the Delhi-Panipat-Ambala-Kalka railway line, and the Kalka-Shimla railways (opened in 1903). By 1901, the town, administered as a notified area, had a population of 7,045, a railway workshop, and a market for ginger and turmeric. The Kalka municipal committee was created on 11 April 1933.

==Climate==
Kalka experiences a subtropical climate, with a monsoon season from late June to early October. The summer starts in mid-April and temperatures peak during May and June. This is followed by the monsoon season, which is accompanied by a drop in temperature and an increase in humidity. Temperatures remain moderate in October and November, but start falling towards the end of November. Winter lasts through December, January, and February, with temperatures lowest in early January. Kalka also receives some rainfall from Western Disturbance, near the end of winter. Winter season, despite being chilly, is mostly free of fog, unlike most North Indian cities in the plains.
==Transport==

===Road===
Kalka is situated along a slope. This makes it somewhat difficult to commute on foot. Local transport (within Kalka) is by shared auto-rickshaws. These autos ply to a distance of around 15–20 km. There are also shared cabs for distances up to 25–30 km. Government and private buses are also very common for commuting to nearby cities. Many intercity govt buses start or pass through Kalka, connecting it with Chandigarh, Ambala, Panipat, Delhi, Shimla, and many other cities.

===Rail===
Kalka railway station is the northern terminal of the Delhi-Kalka line of Northern Railway, Indian Rail (Station code KLK) serving as terminal station for broad gauge line (towards Chandigarh) and narrow gauge line (towards Shimla). Direct trains on broad gauge, connect to Delhi, Howrah etc. In recent years, trains have been started from Kalka to Shirdi, Maharashtra, and to Katra, Jammu which run on specific days of the week.

===Kalka Shimla Railway===

The Kalka Shimla Railway features on the UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites list. Work on the railway line started in 1898 and it opened for traffic in 1903.

==Demographics==

<text>These are tables of congressional delegations from Indiana to the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate.

Since its statehood in 1816, the U.S. state of Indiana has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators statewide to serve for six years, and their elections are staggered to be held in two of every three even-numbered years—Indiana&#x27;s Senate election years are to Classes I and III. Before the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Indiana General Assembly. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, one from each of Indiana&#x27;s nine congressional districts. Before becoming a state, the Indiana Territory elected delegates at-large and sent three to Congress, but the territorial delegates were restricted from voting on legislation.

The longest-serving of any of Indiana&#x27;s Congressmen is Senator Richard Lugar, serving from 1977 to 2013. The longest-serving House member is Lee H. Hamilton, who served from 1965 to 1999. There have been 347 people who have represented Indiana in Congress: 321 in the House, 27 in the Senate, and 18 in both houses, with an average term of seven years. Indiana has elected seven women and three African Americans to Congress.

The current dean of the Indiana delegation is Representative André Carson (IN-7), having served in Congress since 2008.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Current members ===
List of members of the House delegation, their terms in office, district boundaries, and the district political ratings according to the CPVI. The delegation has a total of 9 members, including 7 Republicans and 2 Democrats.

Members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years by popular vote within a congressional district. Indiana has nine congressional districts—this number is reapportioned based on the state&#x27;s population, determined every ten years by a census. Indiana had a maximum representation of 13 congressmen from 1873 to 1933. Since 2003 Indiana has had nine representatives, which was reduced from ten after the 2000 census. This gives Indiana the fourteenth-largest delegation; during the period from 1853 to 1873 the state had the fifth-largest delegation.

=== Historical timeline ===
Indiana has been represented by 322 people in the House, including 1 who was previously a territorial delegate.





==== 1815–1823: 1 at-large seat ====
==== 1823–1833: 3 seats ====
==== 1833–1843: 7 seats ====
==== 1843–1853: 10 seats ====
==== 1853–1873: 11 seats ====
==== 1873–1933: 13 seats ====
==== 1933–1943: 12 seats ====
==== 1943–1983: 11 seats ====

==== 1983–2003: 10 seats ====
==== 2003–present: 9 seats ====
== U.S. Senate ==
Each state elects two senators by statewide popular vote every six years. The terms of the two senators are staggered so that they are not elected in the same year. Indiana&#x27;s senators are elected in the years from classes 1 and 3. Senators were originally chosen by the Indiana General Assembly until the Seventeenth Amendment came into force in 1913.

Of the forty-six men who have been senators from Indiana, there have been three Democratic-Republicans, three Adams Republicans (including James Noble, who was both a Democratic-Republican and Adams Republican), two Whigs, one Unionist, twenty-one Democrats, and seventeen Republicans.

<text>The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial () is a World War II cemetery and memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, Normandy, France, that honors American troops who died in Europe during World War II. It is located on the site of the former temporary battlefield cemetery of Saint Laurent, covers 172.5 acres and contains 9,388 gravesites.

A memorial in the cemetery includes maps and details of the Normandy landings and military operations that followed. At the memorial&#x27;s center is &quot;Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves&quot;, a bronze statue by Donald De Lue. The cemetery also includes two flag poles where, at different times, people gather to watch the American flags being lowered and folded.

The cemetery, which was dedicated in 1956, is the most visited cemetery of those maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), with one million visitors a year. In 2007, the ABMC opened a visitor center at the cemetery, relating the global significance and meaning of Operation Overlord.

==History==

On June 6, 1944, the 607th Quartermaster Graves Registration Company of the U.S. First Army established the temporary cemetery, the first American cemetery on French soil in World War II. After the war, the present-day cemetery was established a short distance to the east of the original site.

It was dedicated on July 19, 1956, in the presence of Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid of the U.S. Navy, representing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and French General , representing President René Coty.

Like all other overseas American cemeteries in France for World War I and II, the French Government has granted the United States a special concession to the land occupied by the cemetery, for an unlimited duration, free of any charge or any tax, as long as the United States maintains the cemetery. It does not benefit from extraterritoriality and remains the property of the French State. This cemetery is managed by the American Battle Monuments Commission, a small independent agency of the U.S. federal government, under Congressional acts that provide yearly financial support for maintaining them, with most military and civil personnel employed abroad. The U.S. flag flies over these granted soils.

==Description==

The cemetery is located on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach (one of the landing beaches of the Normandy Invasion) and the English Channel. It covers 172.5 acres, and contains the remains of 9,388 American military dead, most of whom were killed during the invasion of Normandy and ensuing military operations in World War II. Included are graves of Army Air Corps crews shot down over France as early as 1942 and four American women.

Only some of the soldiers who died overseas are buried in the overseas American military cemeteries. When it came time for a permanent burial, the next of kin eligible to make decisions were asked if they wanted their loved ones repatriated for permanent burial in the United States or interred at the closest overseas cemetery.

==Burials==
===Number of burials===
On June 19, 2018, Julius H.O. Pieper was laid to rest next to his twin brother, Ludwig J.W. Pieper, and became the 9,388th servicemember buried at the Normandy American Cemetery.

These burials are marked by white Lasa marble headstones, 9,238 of which are Latin crosses (for Protestants and Catholics) and 151 of which are stars of David (for Jews). Since these were the only three religions recognized at the time by the United States Army, no other type of markers are present.

The cemetery contains the graves of 45 pairs of brothers (30 of which buried side by side), a father and his son, an uncle and his nephew, 2 pairs of cousins, 3 generals, 4 chaplains, 4 civilians, 4 women, 147 African Americans and 20 Native Americans.

304 unknown soldiers are buried among the other service members. Their headstones read &quot;HERE RESTS IN HONORED GLORY A COMRADE IN ARMS KNOWN BUT TO GOD&quot;.

East of the Memorial lies the Wall of the Missing, where are inscribed the names of 1,557 servicemembers declared missing in action during Operation Overlord. Nineteen of these names bear a bronze rosette, meaning that their body was found and identified since the cemetery&#x27;s dedication.

===Notable interments===
Among the burials at the cemetery are three recipients of the Medal of Honor, including Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of President Theodore Roosevelt. After the creation of the cemetery, another son of President Roosevelt, Quentin, who had been killed in World War I, was exhumed and reburied next to his brother.

Notable burials at the cemetery include:

* Joseph M. Jordan, Benjamin J. Stoney, Robert J. Bloser, Everett J. Gray, and Terrance C. Harris, members of E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne
* Lesley J. McNair, U.S. Army general, one of the two highest-ranking Americans to be killed in action in World War II
* Two of the Niland brothers, Preston and Robert, whose story inspired Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;
* Jimmie W. Monteith, Medal of Honor recipient
* Frank D. Peregory, Medal of Honor recipient
* Quentin Roosevelt, son of President Theodore Roosevelt, aviator killed in action in World War I and reburied next to the grave of his brother, Theodore Roosevelt Jr.
* Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of President Theodore Roosevelt, Medal of Honor recipient

==Layout==
The Cemetery is divided into ten plots. It forms a Latin cross, with the Chapel in its middle, and the Memorial and Wall of the Missing at its base.

It faces the United States, in the direction of a point between Eastport and Lubec, Maine. This is coincidental, as the Cemetery was built parallel to the beach on the lands granted by the French.

===Memorial===
The Memorial consists of a semicircular colonnade with a loggia at each end containing maps and narratives of the military operations. It is built in medium-hard limestone from upper Burgundy. Two of the maps, designed by Robert Foster, are 32 feet long and 20 feet high.

At the center is a 22-foot bronze statue entitled &quot;The Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves&quot; by Donald De Lue.

Over the arches of the Memorial is engraved &quot;THIS EMBATTLED SHORE, PORTAL OF FREEDOM, IS FOREVER HALLOWED BY THE IDEALS, THE VALOR AND THE SACRIFICES OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN&quot;.

At the feet of the Memorial is engraved both in English and French &quot;IN PROUD REMEMBRANCE OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HER SONS AND IN HUMBLE TRIBUTE TO THEIR SACRIFICES THIS MEMORIAL HAS BEEN ERECTED BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot;.

===Wall of the Missing===
The semi-circular gardens bear the 1,557 engraved names of service members declared missing in action in Normandy. Most of them were lost at sea, including over 489 in the sinking of the SS &quot;Léopoldville&quot;.

Nineteen of these names bear a bronze rosette next to their name, meaning that their body was recovered and identified after the cemetery&#x27;s dedication.

Above the walls is engraved, both in English and French,

At its center is engraved &quot;TO THESE WE OWE THE HIGH RESOLVE THAT THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY DIED SHALL LIVE&quot;, an abbreviation of General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s dedication of the Golden Book in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

===Chapel===
At the center of the cemetery lies a multi-confessional chapel. Its altar, in black and gold Pyrenean marble, reads &quot;“I GIVE UNTO THEM ETERNAL LIFE AND THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH”&quot;. The stained glass behind it bears a Latin cross and present a star of David, as well as an alpha and an omega symbol, meant to represent all other religions.

On its ceiling lies a spectacular mosaic by Leon Kroll. Completed in 1953, it comprises 500,000 tiles and tells a full round story “of war and peace.” One side depicts Columbia (Goddess of Liberty) allegorically representing America blessing “her rifle-bearing son before he departs to fight overseas. Above him, a warship and a bomber push through sea and air toward land on the opposite side of the dome. There, a red-capped Marianne figure personifying France bestows a laurel wreath upon the same young man. His now lifeless body leans against her as she cradles his head in her lap. Above them, the return of peace is illustrated with an angel, a dove and a homeward-bound troop ship.” These two figures can be seen again as statues, guarding the end of the cemetery.

Outside is engraved on its wall, both in English and French

THIS CHAPEL HAS BEEN ERECTED BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF HER SONS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE LANDINGS ON THE NORMANDY BEACHES AND THE LIBERATION OF NORTHERN FRANCE ★ THEIR GRAVES ARE THE PERMANENT AND VISIBLE SYMBOL OF THEIR HEROIC DEVOTION AND THEIR SACRIFICE IN THE COMMON CAUSE OF HUMANITY

On its roof is engraved 

THESE ENDURED ALL AND GAVE ALL THAT JUSTICE AMONG NATIONS MIGHT PREVAIL AND THAT MANKIND MIGHT ENJOY FREEDOM AND INHERIT PEACE

===Orientation Table===
An orientation table overlooks the beach and depicts the landings at Normandy. Designed by Robert Foster, it is of Swedish black granite.

===Time capsule===
Embedded in the lawn directly opposite the entrance to the old Visitors&#x27; Building is a time capsule which has been sealed and contains news reports of the June 6, 1944, Normandy landings. The capsule is covered by a pink granite slab upon which is engraved: &quot;To be opened June 6, 2044&quot;. Affixed in the center of the slab is a bronze plaque adorned with the five stars of a General of the Army and engraved with the following inscription: &quot;In memory of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and the forces under his command. This sealed capsule containing news reports of the June 6, 1944, Normandy landings is placed here by the newsmen who were there, June 6, 1969.&quot;

===Landscaping===
The cemetery is planted with Austrian black pines, holly oaks, and Turkey oaks. Its undergrowth is composed of Austrian pines, alders, common oak trees, American red oak trees, holly oak trees, ash trees, sycamore trees, maple trees, and a few maritime pines and pine trees. It is decorated by polyantha roses, common heather and Erica heather.

==Sights==
* Notre-Dame de l&#x27;Assomption de Colleville in Colleville-sur-Mer: dated to the 12th or 13th century, a historical monument since 1840.
* Overlord Museum is located in Colleville-sur-Mer on the road to Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial.

==In popular culture==
* In &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), the cemetery is featured at the beginning and end, showing World War II veteran Private James Francis Ryan accompanied by his family. In the beginning of the film, he makes his way to the grave of Captain John Miller (played by Tom Hanks). At the end, Ryan, who was instructed by Miller to earn the sacrifices made to send him home, says that he lived his life as best as he could and hopes that he has earned all that Miller and his men did for him. After asking for confirmation from his wife that he lived a good life and was a good man, Ryan salutes the grave (both the grave and Captain John Miller are fictional; the headstone for Miller was only brought to the cemetery for the movie). The Private Ryan story is based upon the story of the Niland Brothers, two of whom are buried in the cemetery; references are also made to the five Sullivan brothers, who were all killed in the &quot;&quot;Juneau&quot; incident&quot;.
* &quot;Symphonic Prelude (The Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer)&quot;, by Mark Camphouse, portrays the battle in a way that battles are commonly depicted for bands: a slow introduction followed by a moderate tempo body and a majestic ending.
* The cemetery is featured on the album cover of the 1977 Scorpions album &quot;Taken by Force&quot;.

<text>KOAA-TV (channel 5) is a television station licensed to Pueblo, Colorado, United States, serving as the NBC affiliate for the Colorado Springs area. It is owned by the E.W. Scripps Company alongside low-power Ion Mystery owned-and-operated station KZCS-LD (channel 18). KOAA-TV&#x27;s main studios and business offices are located on 7th Avenue in Pueblo, with a satellite studio and news bureau in the Tech Center office complex in Colorado Springs; its transmitter is located on Cheyenne Mountain.

KOAA-TV operates a low-power digital translator, K30JM-D (channel 30) in Colorado Springs, whose transmitter is also located on Cheyenne Mountain.

==History==
The station signed on for the first time on June 29, 1953, as KCSJ-TV, owned by the Star-Chieftain Publishing Corporation, owners of Pueblo&#x27;s two major newspapers, the morning &quot;Pueblo Chieftain&quot; and evening &quot;Pueblo Star-Journal&quot;, along with KCSJ radio. It is Colorado&#x27;s second-oldest station outside of Denver.

During the 1950s, KCSJ-TV was one of two full-time NBC affiliates serving Southern Colorado—the other being KRDO-TV (channel 13) in Colorado Springs, about to the north. In 1960, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collapsed all of southern Colorado into a single television market. At this point, KCSJ-TV moved its transmitter closer to Colorado Springs and became the area&#x27;s sole NBC affiliate, with KRDO-TV switching to ABC.

In 1962, Star-Chieftain sold KCSJ-TV to Metropolitan Broadcasting, owners of KOA-AM-FM-TV in Denver. KCSJ-TV then became KOAA-TV in March of that year, but remained a free-standing station programmed separately from Denver&#x27;s KOA-TV (now KCNC-TV). The two stations did, however, occasionally do cross-promotion, and both were NBC affiliates (its former sister station in Denver is now a CBS O&amp;O). With much wealthier ownership, KOAA was able to add videotape in 1962. In 1967, it became the first television station in Southern Colorado to broadcast local programming in color. When the Denver stations were sold off to General Electric in 1968, Metropolitan sold KOAA to local owner Sangre De Cristo Broadcasting Corporation (with shares owned by William Grant, Helen T. White, and Mahlon T. White) in a separate deal.

KOAA floundered through the early and mid-1970s, largely because of reception problems in the northern part of the market. When channel 5 moved its transmitter closer to Colorado Springs, it had to conform its signal to protect KFBC-TV (now KGWN-TV) in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a result, while most of Colorado Springs received the channel 5 signal very well, it was barely viewable in northern Colorado Springs and that city&#x27;s northern suburbs because of the area&#x27;s rugged terrain. Most viewers in the northern portion of the market could not get a clear signal from KOAA until cable arrived in the market in the 1970s. This posed a problem for KOAA, as the Colorado Springs area began an unprecedented period of growth that continues to this day while Pueblo remained relatively unchanged. It did not help matters that NBC spent most of the 1970s at the bottom of the ratings.

KOAA finally rebounded in 1977 when the Evening Post Publishing Company of Charleston, South Carolina, bought the station and brought in former ABC executive John Gilbert as general manager (the licensee would be renamed Sangre De Cristo Communications Incorporated). Evening Post&#x27;s broadcasting arm eventually evolved into Cordillera Communications and continued to be a subsidiary of Evening Post Publishing Company. Soon after Gilbert&#x27;s arrival, KOAA opened a studio and sales office in Colorado Springs and steadily beefed up its news operation. In 1980, KOAA signed on K30AA, a 132,500-watt translator on channel 30 in Colorado Springs, bringing a clear signal to the northern part of that city for the first time ever. For the next three decades, it branded itself as &quot;5/30&quot; (denoting both the main and Colorado Springs translator channels). It was also during this time that KOAA adopted the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format that was popular with TV stations nationwide during the 1970s and 1980s. The station&#x27;s resurgence came around the same time that NBC rebounded to become the highest-rated network in the country.

Cordillera announced on October 29, 2018, that it would sell most of its stations, including KOAA, to the E. W. Scripps Company. The sale was completed on May 1, 2019. For the second time in its history, channel 5 became a sister station to a Denver station, this time with KMGH-TV, and as such KOAA shares news sources and certain reporters with KMGH.

==News operation==

KOAA currently broadcasts 37 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). Among the Colorado Springs–Pueblo TV stations that signed on originally in the 1950s, KOAA was the last station to start a morning newscast, which began in January 1996 as an hour-long program leading into NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show, and nudging KRDO-TV to expand the length of its newscast to a half hour at the time (it ran for 15 minutes since its 1983 sign on) and did it one week before the debut of KOAA&#x27;s morning news program. KOAA was the second TV station in the market to add morning newscasts on the weekends starting in 2010.

Starting in 2001, KOAA used the &quot;NewsFirst 5/30&quot; name for its morning and midday newscasts but continued to use the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; brand for all other dayparts until February 8, 2002 (the first day of the 2002 Winter Olympics). On that date, the station adopted the &quot;News First&quot; brand for all of its newscasts.

In 2009, the branding was changed to &quot;NewsFirst 5&quot;, since its translator system (including K30AA, now K30JM-D) could remap to virtual channel 5 throughout the market. The name was modified slightly to &quot;News 5&quot; in 2011. The station operates a &quot;News 5 Now&quot; channel on its second subchannel which is carried by the cable systems in both Colorado Springs and Pueblo, and includes news updates along with real-time weather forecasts and conditions. KOAA used to have newscasts at 4 and 9 p.m. on News 5 Now, but it would later cancel the 4 p.m. newscast and reduced the 9 p.m. newscast to 10 minutes. Eventually the 9 p.m. newscast was canceled altogether. In the fall of 2020, KOAA would bring back a 4 p.m. newscast but this time on the main KOAA channel and running as hour long lead in to its 5 p.m. half hour newscast, coupled with direct competition from KKTV and KRDO-TV which also run full hour long newscasts in the 4 p.m. hour. However by late December 2021, KOAA cut the 4 p.m. news hour to a half hour starting at 4:30 p.m., in order to clear a national news program called &quot;Newsfeed&quot; produced by KOAA&#x27;s parent company Scripps that airs a half hour earlier. In April 2021, KOAA restored a full hour of local news at 4 p.m.

On February 18, 2010, KOAA-TV became the third station in the Colorado Springs–Pueblo market to broadcast its newscasts in true high definition and 16:9 widescreen, beginning with its midday newscast.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
KOAA-TV activated its digital television signal on channel 42 (virtual channel 5.1) on August 1, 2006. It has the capability to broadcast in Dolby 5.1 surround sound. It began broadcasting &quot;NewsFirst NOW&quot; (originally named &quot;WeatherFirst NOW&quot; at launch in 2004) as a digital subchannel (5.2) after only having it on local cable systems earlier. On September 15, 2015, the subchannel became an affiliate of WeatherNation TV, while retaining the &quot;News 5 NOW&quot; name.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KOAA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 42, using virtual channel 5.

On April 15, 2010, K30AA was converted from analog to digital and continues to operate as a repeater of KOAA-TV. On June 14, K30AA changed its calls to K30JM-D.

<text>Nydia Margarita Velázquez Serrano ( , ; born March 28, 1953) is an American politician serving in the United States House of Representatives since 1993. A Democrat from New York, Velázquez chaired the Congressional Hispanic Caucus until January 3, 2011. Her district, in New York City, was numbered the from 1993 to 2013 and has been numbered the since 2013. Velázquez is the first Puerto Rican woman to serve in the United States Congress.

== Early life, education and career ==
Velázquez was born in the town of Limones in the municipality of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, on March 28, 1953. She grew up in a small house on the Río Limones with eight other siblings. Her mother was Carmen Luisa Serrano Medina, and her father, Benito Velázquez Rodríguez, was a low-income worker in the sugarcane fields who became a self-taught political activist and the founder of a local political party; he was also listed as &quot;Black&quot; on the 1940 U.S. census. Political conversations at the Velázquez dinner table focused on workers&#x27; rights.

Velázquez attended public schools and skipped three grades as a child. She became the first person in her family to graduate from high school. At age 16, she became a student at University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras. In 1974, she received a B.A. degree in political science, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, and became a teacher. In college, Velázquez supported Puerto Rican independence; by the time she ran for Congress in 1992, Velázquez no longer addressed the issue, saying that it must be left up to the Puerto Rican people.

In 1976, Velázquez received an M.A. degree in political science from New York University. She served as an instructor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao from 1976 to 1981. After returning to New York City, Velázquez was an adjunct professor of Puerto Rican studies at Hunter College from 1981 to 1983.

== Political career ==
In 1983, Velázquez was special assistant to Representative Edolphus Towns, a Democrat representing New York&#x27;s 10th congressional district in Brooklyn.

In 1984, Howard Golden (then the Brooklyn Borough president and chairman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party) named Velázquez to fill a vacant seat on the New York City Council, making her the first Hispanic woman to serve on the council. Velázquez ran for election to the council in 1986, but lost to a challenger.

From May 1986 to July 1989, Velázquez was national director of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources&#x27; Migration Division Office. In 1989 the governor of Puerto Rico named her the director of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States. In this role, according to a 1992 &quot;The New York Times&quot; profile, &quot;Velazquez solidified her reputation that night as a street-smart and politically savvy woman who understood the value of solidarity and loyalty to other politicians, community leaders and organized labor.&quot;

Velázquez pioneered &quot;&quot;, a program that aims to politically empower Latinos in the United States through voter registration and other projects. The project spread from New York to Hartford, Connecticut; New Jersey; Chicago; and Boston, helping Hispanic candidates secure electoral wins.

=== Puerto Rico ===
Velázquez has been an advocate for human and civil rights of the Puerto Rican people. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, she was a leader in the Vieques movement, which sought to stop the United States military from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground. In May 2000, Velázquez was one of nearly 200 people arrested (including fellow Representative Luis Gutiérrez) for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range. Velázquez was ultimately successful: in May 2003, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility on Vieques Island was closed, and in May 2004, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s last remaining base on Puerto Rico, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station – which employed 1,000 local contractors and contributed $300 million to the local economy – was closed.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===
==== 1992 ====
Velázquez ran for Congress in the 1992 election, seeking a seat in the New York&#x27;s newly drawn 12th congressional district, which was drawn as a majority-Hispanic district. She won the Democratic primary, defeating nine-term incumbent Stephen J. Solarz, who was heavily damaged by the House banking scandal, and four Hispanic candidates.

==== 2010 ====

Velázquez&#x27;s 2010 campaign income was $759,359. She came out of this campaign about $7,736 in debt. Her top contributors included Goldman Sachs, the American Bankers Association, the National Roofing Contractors Association and the National Telephone Cooperative Association.

==== 2012 ====

Velázquez, who was redistricted into the 7th congressional district, defeated her challengers to win the Democratic nomination. Her top contributors included Goldman Sachs, the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America.

=== Tenure ===

On September 29, 2008, Velázquez voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. On November 19, 2008, she was elected by her peers in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to lead the group in the 111th Congress.

Before removing her name from consideration, she was considered a possible candidate to be appointed to the United States Senate by Governor David Paterson after Senator Hillary Clinton resigned to become secretary of state.

Among Velázquez&#x27;s firsts are: the first Hispanic woman to serve on the New York City Council; the first Puerto Rican woman to serve in Congress; and the first woman Ranking Democratic Member of the House Small Business Committee in 1998. She became the first woman to chair the United States House Committee on Small Business in January 2007 as well as the first Hispanic woman to chair a House standing committee.

Valazquez voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

Velázquez was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

In September 2024, Nydia M. Velázquez presented a federal bill called the &quot;Mel Law,&quot; which guarantees posthumous degrees to students who die before completing their mandatory studies.

== Personal life ==
Velázquez, also known as &quot;la luchadora&quot;, married Brooklyn-based printer Paul Bader in 2000. It was her second marriage. In November 2002, New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson controversially hired Bader as an administrative manager in the Bureau of Law and Adjudications, joining Joyce Miller, wife of Representative Jerry Nadler, and Chirlane McCray, wife of City Councilman Bill de Blasio. In 2010, Velázquez and Bader were in the process of divorce.

In October 1992, during her first campaign for the House, an unknown person at Saint Clare&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan anonymously faxed to the press Velázquez&#x27;s hospital records pertaining to a suicide attempt in 1991. At a subsequent press conference, Velázquez acknowledged that she had attempted suicide that year while suffering from clinical depression. She said that she underwent counseling and &quot;emerged stronger and more committed to public service.&quot; She expressed outrage at the leak of personal health records and asked the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general to investigate. Velázquez sued the hospital in 1994, alleging that the hospital had failed to protect her privacy. The lawsuit was settled in 1997.

Velázquez is Catholic.

<text>The Bowery () is a street and neighborhood in Lower Manhattan in New York City, United States. The street runs from Chatham Square at Park Row, Worth Street, and Mott Street in the south to Cooper Square at 4th Street in the north. The eponymous neighborhood runs roughly from the Bowery east to Allen Street and First Avenue, and from Canal Street north to Cooper Square/East Fourth Street. The neighborhood roughly overlaps with Little Australia. To the south is Chinatown, to the east are the Lower East Side and the East Village, and to the west are Little Italy and NoHo. It has historically been considered a part of the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

In the 17th century, the road branched off Broadway north of Fort Amsterdam at the tip of Manhattan to the homestead of Peter Stuyvesant, director-general of New Netherland. The street was known as Bowery Lane prior to 1807. &quot;Bowery&quot; is an anglicization of the Dutch , derived from an antiquated Dutch word for &quot;farm&quot;: In the 17th century the area contained many large farms.

The New York City Subway&#x27;s Bowery station, serving the BMT Nassau Street Line (), is located close to the Bowery&#x27;s intersection with Delancey and Kenmare Streets. There is a tunnel under the Bowery intended for use by a never-built subway extension. The M103 bus runs on the entire Bowery.

==History==
===Colonial and Federal periods===
The Bowery is the oldest thoroughfare on Manhattan Island, preceding European intervention as a Lenape footpath, which spanned roughly the entire length of the island, from north to south. When the Dutch settled Manhattan island, they named the path &quot;Bouwerie road&quot; – &quot;bouwerie&quot; (or later &quot;bouwerij&quot;) being an old Dutch word for &quot;farm&quot; – because it connected farmlands and estates on the outskirts to the heart of the city in today&#x27;s Wall Street/Battery Park area.

In 1654, the Bowery&#x27;s first residents settled in the area of Chatham Square; ten freedmen and their wives set up cabins and a cattle farm there. Petrus Stuyvesant, the last Dutch governor of New Amsterdam before the English took control, retired to his Bowery farm in 1667. After his death in 1672, he was buried in his private chapel. His mansion burned down in 1778 and his great-grandson sold the remaining chapel and graveyard, now the site of the Episcopal church of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery.

In her &quot;Journal&quot; of 1704–05, Sarah Kemble Knight describes the Bowery as a leisure destination for residents of New York City in December:

Their Diversions in the Winter is Riding Sleys about three or four Miles out of Town, where they have Houses of entertainment at a place called Bowery, and some go to friends Houses who handsomely treat them. [...] I believe we mett 50 or 60 slays that day – they fly with great swiftness and some are so furious that they&#x27;le turn out of the path for none except a Loaden Cart. Nor do they spare for any diversion the place affords, and sociable to a degree, they&#x27;r Tables being as free to their Naybours as to themselves.

By 1766, when John Montresor made his detailed plan of New York, &quot;Bowry Lane&quot;, which took a more north-tending track at the rope walk, was lined for the first few streets with buildings that formed a solid frontage, with market gardens behind them; when Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist for Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, immigrated to New York City in 1806, he briefly ran one of the shops along the Bowery, a fruit and vegetable store. In 1766, straight lanes led away at right angles to gentlemen&#x27;s seats, mostly well back from the dusty &quot;Road to Albany and Boston&quot;, as it was labeled on Montresor&#x27;s map; Nicholas Bayard&#x27;s was planted as an avenue of trees. James Delancey&#x27;s grand house, flanked by matching outbuildings, stood behind a forecourt facing Bowery Lane; behind it was his parterre garden, ending in an exedra, clearly delineated on the map.

The Bull&#x27;s Head Tavern was noted for George Washington&#x27;s having stopped there for refreshment before riding down to the waterfront to witness the departure of British troops in 1783. Leading to the Post Road, the main route to Boston, the Bowery rivaled Broadway as a thoroughfare; as late as 1869, when it had gained the &quot;reputation of cheap trade, without being disreputable&quot; it was still &quot;the second principal street of the city&quot;.

===Early growth===

As the population of New York City continued to grow, its northern boundary continued to shift northward, and by the early 1800s the Bowery was no longer a farming area outside the city. The street gained in respectability and elegance, becoming a broad boulevard, as well-heeled and famous people moved their residences there, including Peter Cooper, the industrialist and philanthropist. The Bowery began to rival Fifth Avenue as an address.

When Lafayette Street was opened parallel to the Bowery in the 1820s, the Bowery Theatre was founded by rich families on the site of the Red Bull Tavern, which had been purchased by Andrew Morris and John Jacob Astor; it opened in 1826 and was the largest auditorium in North America at the time. Across the way the Bowery Amphitheatre was erected in 1833, specializing in the more populist entertainments of equestrian shows and circuses. From stylish beginnings, the tone of Bowery Theatre&#x27;s offerings matched the slide in the social scale of the Bowery itself.

===Economic decline===

By the time of the Civil War, the mansions and shops had given way to popular music halls, brothels, beer gardens, pawn shops, and flophouses, like the one at No. 15 where the composer Stephen Foster lived in 1864. Theodore Dreiser closed his tragedy &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, set in the 1890s, with the suicide of one of the main characters in a Bowery flophouse. The Bowery, which marked the eastern border of the slum of &quot;Five Points&quot;, had also become the turf of one of America&#x27;s earliest street gangs, the nativist Bowery Boys. In the spirit of social reform, the first YMCA opened on the Bowery in 1873; another notable religious and social welfare institution established during this period was the Bowery Mission, founded in 1880 at 36 Bowery by Reverend Albert Gleason Ruliffson. The mission has remained along the Bowery throughout its lifetime. In 1909 the mission moved to its current location at 227–229 Bowery.

By the 1890s, the Bowery was a center for prostitution that rivaled the Tenderloin, also in Manhattan, and for bars catering to gay men and some lesbians at various social levels, from The Slide at 157 Bleecker Street, New York&#x27;s &quot;worst dive&quot;, to Columbia Hall at 5th Street, called Paresis Hall. One investigator in 1899 found six saloons and dance halls, the resorts of &quot;degenerates&quot; and &quot;fairies&quot;, on the Bowery alone. Gay subculture was more highly visible there and more integrated into working-class male culture than it was to become in the following generations, according to historian George Chauncey.

From 1878 to 1955 the Third Avenue El ran above the Bowery, further darkening its streets, populated largely by men. &quot;It is filled with employment agencies, cheap clothing and knickknack stores, cheap moving-picture shows, cheap lodging-houses, cheap eating-houses, cheap saloons&quot;, writers in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; found it in 1919. &quot;Here, too, by the thousands come sailors on shore leave, – notice the &#x27;studios&#x27; of the tattoo artists, – and here most in evidence are the &#x27;down and outs&#x27;&quot;. Prohibition eliminated the Bowery&#x27;s numerous saloons: One Mile House, the &quot;stately old tavern... replaced by a cheap saloon&quot; at the southeast corner of Rivington Street, named for the battered milestone across the way, where the politicians of the East Side had made informal arrangements for the city&#x27;s governance, was renovated for retail space in 1921, &quot;obliterating all vestiges of its former appearance&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported. Restaurant supply stores were among the businesses that had come to the Bowery, and many remain to this day.

Pressure for a new name after World War I came to naught and in the 1920s and 1930s, it was an impoverished area. From the 1940s through the 1970s, the Bowery was New York City&#x27;s &quot;Skid Row,&quot; notable for &quot;Bowery Bums&quot; (disaffected alcoholics and homeless persons). Among those who wrote about Bowery personalities was &quot;New Yorker&quot; staff member Joseph Mitchell (1908–1996). Aside from cheap clothing stores that catered to the derelict and down-and-out population of men, commercial activity along the Bowery became specialized in used restaurant supplies and lighting fixtures. In the 1930s and again in 1947, there were efforts to change the name of the Bowery to something more &quot;dignified and prosaic&quot;, such as &quot;Fourth Avenue South&quot;.

===Revival and gentrification===

The vagrant population of the Bowery declined after the 1970s, in part because of the city&#x27;s effort to disperse it. Since the 1990s the entire Lower East Side has been reviving, and gentrification has contributed to ongoing change along the Bowery. In particular, the number of high-rise condominiums is growing. In 2007, the SANAA-designed facility for the New Museum of Contemporary Art opened between Stanton and Prince Street. In 2008, AvalonBay Communities opened Avalon Bowery Place, its first luxury apartment complex on the Bowery; the structure includes a Whole Foods Market. Avalon Bowery Place was quickly followed with the development of Avalon Bowery Place II.

The new development has not come without social costs. Michael Dominic&#x27;s 2001 documentary &quot;Sunshine Hotel&quot; followed the lives of residents of one of the few remaining flophouses. Construction on the Wyndham Garden Hotel at 93 Bowery in the late Aughts destabilized neighboring building 128 Hester Street (owned by the same man, William Su), and 60 tenants were thrown out of the building with the help of the Department of Buildings. At least 75 tenants were displaced from 83 to 85 Bowery in January 2018 in frigid temperatures due to long-overdue repairs that needed to be made. Tenants accused the landlord of using this displacement to start renovating the buildings into a hotel, and they went on a hunger strike.

The Bowery from Houston to Delancey Street still serves as New York&#x27;s principal market for restaurant equipment and from Delancey to Grand for lamps.

==Areas==

===Upper and Lower Bowery===
The upper Bowery refers to the portion of the Bowery north of Houston Street; the lower Bowery refers to the portion south of it.

===Bowery Historic District===
In October 2011, a Bowery Historic District was registered with the New York State Register of Historic Places and therefore was automatically nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. A grassroots community organization named Bowery Alliance of Neighbors (BAN) in association with the community-based housing organization called the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council led the effort for creation of the historic district. The designation means that property owners will have financial incentives to restore rather than demolish old buildings on the Bowery. BAN was recognized for its preservation efforts with a Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation in 2013. The historic district runs from Chatham Square to Astor Place on both sides of the Bowery.

===Little Saigon===
New York&#x27;s &quot;Little Saigon&quot;, though not officially designated, exists on the Bowery between Grand Street and Hester Street. &quot;New York&quot; magazine claims that while this street blends in with neighboring Chinatown, the area is filled with Vietnamese restaurants.

==Notable places==
===Amato Opera===
This company, founded in 1948 by Tony Amato and his wife, Sally, found a permanent home at 319 Bowery next to the former CBGB and afforded many young singers the opportunity to hone their craft in full-length productions with a cut-down orchestration. The curtain fell on this well-established NYC opera forum on May 31, 2009, when Tony Amato retired.

===Bank buildings===
The Bowery Savings Bank was chartered in May 1834, when the Bowery was an upscale residential street, and grew with the rising prosperity of the city. Its 1893 headquarters building at 130 Bowery is an official New York City designated landmark, as is the 1920s domed Citizens Savings Bank.

===Bowery Ballroom===
The Bowery Ballroom is a music venue. The structure, at 6 Delancey Street, was built just before the Stock Market Crash of 1929. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it became a high-end retail store. The neighborhood subsequently went into decline again, and so did the caliber of businesses occupying the space. In 1997 it was converted into a music venue. It has a capacity of 550 people.

Directly in front of the venue&#x27;s entrance is the Bowery station () of the New York City Subway.

The club serves as the namesake of at least one recording: Joan Baez&#x27;s &quot;Bowery Songs&quot; album, recorded live at a concert at the Bowery Ballroom in November 2004.

===Bowery Mural===
The Bowery Mural is an outdoor exhibition space located on the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery, on a wall owned by Goldman Properties since 1984. Real estate developer Tony Goldman began the project with Jeffery Deitch and Deitch Projects in 2008. Goldman&#x27;s goal was to use this wall to present the top contemporary artists from around the world, with an emphasis on artists who work on the streets. Seasonal murals have appeared on the wall curated and organized in collaboration with The Hole, NYC, an art gallery in SoHo run by former Deitch Projects directors Kathy Grayson and Meghan Coleman.

The mural series was initiated from March to December 2008 with a tribute to Keith Haring’s noted 1982 Bowery mural. This was followed by a mural by the Brazilian twin-brother duo Os Gêmeos, which they dedicated to artist Dash Snow, who had recently died from a drug overdose; this was presented from July 2009 to March 2010. The next mural, by Shepard Fairey, was on exhibit from April through August 2010, and was followed by a mural by Barry McGee which celebrated the role of graffiti tagging in the history of New York City street art; it was on display from August to November 2010. This was followed by a tribute to Dash Snow by Irak, which ran from November 24–26, 2010. Other artists to have murals presented include the twins How &amp; Nosm (2012), Crash (2013), Martha Cooper (2013), Revok and Pose (2013), Swoon (2014), and Maya Hayuk.

===Bowery Poetry===
Bowery Poetry is a performance space at Bowery and Bleecker Street. It was founded in 2001 as Bowery Poetry Club (BPC), and provided a home base for established and upcoming artists. It was founded by Bob Holman, owner of the building and former Nuyorican Poets Café Poetry Slam MC (1988–1996). The BPC featured regular shows by Amiri Baraka, Anne Waldman, Taylor Mead, Taylor Mali, along with open mic, gay poets, a weekly poetry slam, and an Emily Dickinson Marathon, amongst other events. The club closed in 2012 and reopened in 2013 as a shared performance space under the name &quot;Bowery Poetry&quot;. Bowery Arts + Science presents poetry, and Duane Park presents alternative burlesque in this space.

===Bowery Theatre===

The Bowery Theatre was a 19th-century playhouse at 46 Bowery. It was founded in the 1820s by rich families to compete with the upscale Park Theatre. By the 1850s, the theatre came to cater to immigrant groups such as the Irish, Germans, and Chinese. It burned down four times in 17 years, and a fire in 1929 destroyed it for good.

===CBGB===

CBGB, a club that was opened to play country, bluegrass &amp; blues (as the name CBGB stands for), began to book Television, Patti Smith, and the Ramones as house bands in the mid-1970s. This spawned a full-blown scene of new bands (Talking Heads, Blondie, edgy R&amp;B-influenced Mink DeVille, rockabilly revivalist Robert Gordon, and others) performing mostly original material in a mostly raw and often loud and fast attack. The label of punk rock was applied to the scene even if not all the bands that made their early reputations at the club were punk rockers, strictly speaking, but CBGB became known as the American cradle of punk rock. CBGB closed on October 31, 2006, after a long battle by club owner Hilly Kristal to extend its lease. The space is now a John Varvatos boutique.

===Miner&#x27;s Bowery Theatre===

Miner&#x27;s Bowery Theatre was a vaudeville or variety show theater opened by Senator Henry Clay Miner in 1878. The theater was known for its method of encouraging anyone to get on stage and perform on amateur nights, and for its method of removing bad performers from the stage by yanking them off with a wooden hook.
Starting in the 1890s, a stage-prop shepherd&#x27;s hook was used to pull bad performers bodily from the stage, after audience members shouted, &quot;Give &#x27;im the hook.&quot; The phrase, &quot;Give him the hook&quot; originated at Miners Bowery Theatre.

===New Museum===

In December 2007, the New Museum opened the doors of its new location at 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, continuing its focus of exhibiting international and women artists and artists of color. This new facility, designed by the Tokyo-based firm Sejima + Nishizawa/SANAA and the New York-based firm Gensler, has greatly expanded the museum&#x27;s exhibitions and space. In March 2008, the museum&#x27;s new building was named one of the architectural seven wonders by &quot;Conde Nast Traveler&quot;. The museum has an ongoing &quot;Bowery Project&quot; honoring artists who lived on the Bowery with taped interviews and archived records.

<doc id="948529" wikidata="Q6553311" url="?curid=948529" title="Pakistani presidential line of succession">
<text>The line of succession to the Presidency of Pakistan is the order in which persons may become or act as the President of Pakistan upon the incapacity, resignation or death of an incumbent President. Pakistan, by law, has a parliamentary democratic system of government that has been modified several times since its inception. The prime minister of Pakistan is the head of the government, while the president of Pakistan, by law and by statute, is a constitutional figurehead.

The constitution does not include a position of Vice President, but in absence of president of Pakistan, the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan acts as the President. If the Chairman, for any reason, is unable to perform the functions of the office of the president, the Speaker of the National Assembly acts as president until a president is elected. The Electoral College of Pakistan (a special session of the parliament, senate and all four provincial assemblies) elects a new president in accordance with Article 41(3) of the constitution. Amendment XVIII, Article 49 of the constitution of Pakistan covers this matter.

== Current order of succession ==
The current presidential line of succession, as specified by the Constitution is:
== Succession acts ==
=== Article 49 ===
Chairman or Speaker to act as, or perform functions of, President

*If the office of President becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation or removal of the President the Chairman or, if he is unable to perform the functions of the office of President, the Speaker of the National Assembly shall act as President until a President is elected in accordance with clause (3) of Article 41.
*When the President, by reason of absence from Pakistan or any other cause, is unable to perform his functions, the Chairman or, if he too is absent or unable to perform the functions of the office of President, the Speaker of the National Assembly shall perform the functions of President until the President returns to Pakistan or, as the case may be, resumes his functions.

<text>KKTV (channel 11) is a television station in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States, affiliated with CBS. The station is owned by Gray Media, and maintains studios on East Colorado Avenue in downtown Colorado Springs and a transmitter on Cheyenne Mountain.

==History==
KKTV signed on the air on December 7, 1952. It is the third-oldest station in Colorado—behind Denver&#x27;s KWGN-TV and KUSA-TV—and the oldest outside Denver. The station&#x27;s first studio located on Mill Street was too small from the beginning. It originally carried programming from CBS, NBC, ABC, and DuMont. In 1953, KRDO-TV (channel 13) signed on and took the NBC affiliation. DuMont folded in 1956, leaving KKTV as a primary CBS affiliate and secondary ABC affiliate. That same year, the station moved its operations to a new building located on South Tejon Street in Colorado Springs.

By 1960, the formerly separate Colorado Springs and Pueblo markets became one single market serving the Pikes Peak region and surrounding areas with each of the area&#x27;s three TV stations becoming &quot;exclusive&quot; network affiliates. KKTV became a sole CBS affiliate with KRDO-TV becoming a full-time ABC affiliate and Pueblo&#x27;s KCSJ-TV (channel 5, now KOAA-TV), which had been a primary NBC affiliate since its inception in 1953, becoming the area&#x27;s sole NBC affiliate. In 1963, KKTV&#x27;s original owners, TV Colorado, sold the station to Willard W. Garvey, who held a minority stake in Stauffer Publications Stations. In December 1968, KKTV relocated to a new studio facility on North Nevada Avenue in Colorado Springs, which had previously functioned as a film stage. By the time the move was complete, a deal had been reached to sell KKTV to the Capitol Broadcasting Company of Jackson, Mississippi, which owned radio and television properties in that city.

In late 1982, Capitol Broadcasting Company sold KKTV to the Seattle-based Ackerley Group (originally called Ackerley Communications), becoming one of that company&#x27;s earliest acquisitions. Ackerley owned the station until early 1999 when it swapped KKTV to Benedek Broadcasting in exchange for KCOY in Santa Maria, California. Current owner Gray Television acquired KKTV when it bought most of Benedek&#x27;s stations in April 2002 as part of Benedek&#x27;s bankruptcy liquidation.

On October 17, 2009; KKTV became the second station in the Colorado Springs-Pueblo market to present its newscasts in high definition (HD) beginning with its 10 p.m. newscast.

On June 23, 2012, at around 2 p.m. MDT, KKTV began to provide live 24/7 continuous coverage of the Waldo Canyon fire in Colorado Springs. KKTV called in help from KOLN in Lincoln, Nebraska, WOWT in Omaha, Nebraska, KCNC-TV in Denver, and KOLO-TV in Reno, Nevada (KOLN, WOWT, and KOLO are sister stations to KKTV, CBS-owned KCNC shares a helicopter with KKTV), to help out with the coverage of the fire. The nonstop coverage wrapped up at midnight on June 29, 130 hours after it started. KKTV&#x27;s syndicated and CBS programming were shown on Channel 11.2 during its 24/7 fire coverage. The coverage was praised by various critics, and won the &quot;Colorado Springs Independent&quot;″s Best Local TV Newscast award for 2012, ending a long streak in that category by KOAA. KKTV&#x27;s news ratings have gone up considerably since their Waldo Canyon fire coverage, and as of January 2013, they are claiming their news ratings are &quot;Southern Colorado&#x27;s Most Watched&quot;, higher than KOAA or KRDO.
KKTV announced plans to move into a new location at 520 East Colorado Avenue in downtown Colorado Springs. The move was completed in mid-2013.

==News operation==
KKTV currently broadcasts 35 hours of locally produced newscasts (with six hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays, and three hours on Sundays). KKTV was the last station in the Colorado Springs–Pueblo market to produce morning newscasts on the weekends, which began on the weekend of November 13–14, 2021. However, KKTV was the second TV station in the Colorado Springs–Pueblo market to broadcast an early morning newscast beginning in late 1992 originally running a full hour, while rival KRDO-TV continued to stick with a 15-minute length morning newscast (and would eventually extend the program&#x27;s length beginning in early 1996).

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
KKTV began broadcasting a digital signal on channel 10 in 2003.

On September 5, 2006, KKTV launched a subchannel carrying MyNetworkTV programming, under the branding MyKKTV. KKTV-DT2 is carried on cable channel 41 in Colorado Springs and cable channel 246 in Pueblo. When the channel first launched it carried replays and extra runs of KKTV&#x27;s syndicated programming (such as &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;) and some exclusive syndicated such as &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;30 Rock&quot;. At one point, KKTV produced a 9 p.m. newscast for the subchannel. Around September 8, 2015, KKTV-DT2 began airing select programming from MeTV alongside syndicated programming. By October 2019, MeTV took up a bulk of the schedule outside of MyNetworkTV programming, with the service moving to the graveyard slot, airing from 2 to 4 a.m. on Tuesdays through Saturdays, an increasingly common fate for the service.

From October 2007 to January 2010, KKTV broadcast a 24-hour weather channel called &quot;KKTV No Wait Weather&quot; on digital channel 11.3 and area cable providers. The channel began as a time filler service on KKTV digital channel 11.2. No Wait Weather was also seen on 11.2 overnights but this was discontinued in June 2009. On January 1, 2010, this service was discontinued and KKTV-DT3 was removed from Cable 140.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KKTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 10, using virtual channel 11.

On January 21, 2011, KKTV began broadcasting on UHF channel 49 and discontinued its broadcast on VHF channel 10 at noon on January 24. Moving to the UHF dial was deemed necessary because of viewer reception (all other Springs area commercial stations were on UHF by 2009) and interference issues with the VHF broadcast.

On June 6, 2019, KKTV switched frequencies from RF channel 49 to RF channel 26 due to the FCC spectrum repack.

<text>Since Iowa became a U.S. state in 1846, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years, and members of the House to two-year terms. Before becoming a state, the Iowa Territory elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1838 to 1846.

These are tables of congressional delegations from Iowa to the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.

== Current delegation ==

Iowa&#x27;s current congressional delegation in the consists of its two senators and four representatives, all Republicans.

== United States Senate ==

== United States House of Representatives ==
=== 1838–1846: 1 non-voting delegate ===
On July 4, 1838, the Iowa Territory was organized. Most of the area comprising the territory was originally part of the Louisiana Purchase and was a part of the Missouri Territory. When Missouri became a state in 1821, this area (along with the Dakotas) effectively became unorganized territory. The area was closed to white settlers until the 1830s, after the Black Hawk War ended. It was attached to the Michigan Territory on June 28, 1834, and was split off with the Wisconsin Territory in 1836 when Michigan became a state. The Iowa Territory was the &quot;Iowa District&quot; of western Wisconsin Territory – the region west of the Mississippi River. The original boundaries of the territory, as established in 1838, included part of Minnesota and parts of the Dakotas, covering about of land.

Starting on September 10, 1838, Iowa Territory sent a non-voting delegate to the House.

=== 1846–1863: 2 seats ===
Following statehood on December 28, 1846, Iowa had two seats in the House. It elected both seats statewide at-large on a general ticket, until 1847, when it redistricted into two districts.

Following the 1860 census, Iowa was apportioned 6 seats.

=== 1873–1883: 9 seats ===
Following the 1870 census, Iowa was apportioned 9 seats.

<text>The Federated Women&#x27;s Institutes of Canada is an umbrella organization for Women&#x27;s Institutes in Canada.

&quot;The idea to form a national group was first considered in 1912. In 1914, however, when the war began the idea was abandoned. At the war&#x27;s end, it was Miss Mary MacIssac, Superintendent of Alberta Women&#x27;s Institute, who revived the idea. She realized the importance of organizing the rural women of Canada so they might speak as one voice for needed reforms, and the value of co-ordinating provincial groups for a more consistent organization. In February 1919, representatives of the provinces met in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to form the Federated Women&#x27;s Institutes of Canada.&quot; - History of FWIC

<text>Disney Cruise Line is a cruise line operation that is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. The company was incorporated in 1996 as Magical Cruise Company Limited, through its first vessel &quot;Disney Magic,&quot; and is domiciled in London, England, with their operational headquarters located in Celebration, Florida. Disney Cruise Line operates six ships: &quot;Disney Magic&quot;, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot;, &quot;Disney Dream&quot;, &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Disney Wish&quot;, and &quot;Disney Treasure&quot;. Two ships will join the fleet in 2025: &quot;Disney Destiny&quot;, and &quot;Disney Adventure&quot;. Castaway Cay, a private island in the Bahamas, is exclusively operated by Disney Cruise Line and is designed as an exclusive port of call for Disney&#x27;s ships. A second private destination, Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point, a 700-acre property on the southern end of Eleuthera, Bahamas opened on June 6, 2024. Disney Cruise Line operates two Disney Cruise Line Terminals in Florida.

== Background ==
In 1985, Premier Cruise Line became Disney&#x27;s licensed partner cruise line. This allowed Disney characters on their ships and combined cruise, hotel, and theme park packages. In 1993, Premier ended their relationship with Disney and signed a new one with Warner Brothers, utilizing the Looney Tunes characters. Premier continued to offer Disney Land and Sea packages while adding Universal Studios as an option. Thus, Disney approached both Carnival and Royal Caribbean cruise lines to replace Premier as an exclusive sea partner.

== History ==
When Disney&#x27;s negotiations with two major cruise lines, Carnival and Royal Caribbean, did not produce results, Disney had cruise ship designs drawn up by February 1994. Meanwhile, Walt Disney Travel Company started signing up other cruise lines to offer Disney hotels and resort packages. In May 1994, Disney announced that they intended to start cruise line operations in 1998. Arthur Rodney was selected to serve as the first president of the cruise line tentatively called Disney Vacation Cruises.

In 1995, Disney Cruise Line commissioned &quot;Disney Magic&quot; and &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; from Fincantieri in Italy. The cruise line was incorporated as Devonson Cruise Company, Limited in February 1996, in the United Kingdom, and was renamed Magical Cruise Company Limited in October 1996. The cruise line cost as much as a theme park to start up. In 1996, Magical Cruise Company purchased Gorda Cay as the line&#x27;s private island. The company spent $25 million over 18 months on the island and renamed it Castaway Cay.

The &quot;Disney Magic&quot;″s first cruise was originally scheduled for March 1998 but was postponed twice. The &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; was scheduled for December 1998. On July 30, 1998, with the first voyage of Magic, the Disney Cruise Line was operational. A 10-year contract was signed with Port Canaveral for its home terminal. With the August 1999, resignation of Rodney as cruise line president, the senior operating officer Matt Ouimet was named as his replacement in July. In 2002, the line added seven-day cruises and western Caribbean cruises.

In May 2005, &quot;Disney Magic&quot; moved its port for the summer cruise season to the Port of Los Angeles. This was temporary for the company&#x27;s 50th-anniversary celebration of Disneyland and as a test for California expansion. The transfer cruise sold out quicker than expected. Bookings from first-time Disney cruisers were up for these cruises by at least 60%. While Disney had wanted additional ships, shipbuilding costs had increased by at least 33% since it built its first two ships. The &quot;Disney Magic&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean for an extended stay in 2007. In 2007, Disney announced the building of two new cruise ships. &quot;Disney Dream&quot; set sail in January 2011, followed closely by &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot; in 2012. Meyer Werft shipyard, based in Papenburg, Germany, built the new ships.

=== New Vacation Operation unit ===
In February 2009, Tom McAlpin left the Disney Cruise Line presidency and was replaced by Karl Holz as president of Disney Cruise Line and New Vacation Operations. In early 2009, Disney and Canaveral Port Authority extended their agreement to 2022 with expansion to the terminal to handle the new class of ships. A re-posting of the &quot;Disney Magic&quot; to Europe in 2010 added DCL&#x27;s first North European cruises to its existing Mediterranean cruises.

With the arrival of &quot;Disney Dream&quot; in 2011, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; was relocated to Los Angeles. With the arrival of &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot; in 2012, &quot;Disney Magic&quot; was relocated to New York City in May 2012 for only the Summer season, before relocating to Galveston, Texas.

In late 2012, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; began sailing cruises out of Miami, Florida. In 2013, the &quot;Disney Magic&quot; relocated to Barcelona, Spain and the &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, for the summer season. In autumn 2013, the &quot;Magic&quot; and the &quot;Wonder&quot; returned to the United States but switched home ports, with the &quot;Magic&quot; leaving out of Miami and the &quot;Wonder&quot; leaving out of Galveston. In January 2014, the &quot;Wonder&quot; took over for the &quot;Magic&quot; in Miami and the &quot;Magic&quot; joined the &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;Fantasy&quot; in Port Canaveral, placing all four ships in the state of Florida for the first time. Since then, the &quot;Magic&quot; and the &quot;Wonder&quot; have again switched places.

At the February 2016 Cruise Critic Cruisers&#x27; Choice Awards, three of Disney&#x27;s ships won 11 category awards. The company ordered three ships of a new class of ship, Triton, in 2016 and 2017. At the company annual meeting in March 2016, Walt Disney Company Chairman Bob Iger announced the first two new ships of the new line which were planned to be built larger than the previous two ships. The first ship, Disney Wish joined in 2022. And the second, Disney Treasure joined in 2024. In July 2017, Bob Chapek, President of Walt Disney Parks &amp; Resorts, announced at the D23 Expo that a seventh unnamed ship would join the fleet.

In 2016, the cruise line was looking to buy Egg Island, Eleuthera, the Bahamas, as another destination for the additional cruise ships. However, opposition from nearby island residents and potential damage to the islands&#x27; reefs stopped plans.

In April 2017, it was announced that Karl Holz would retire as president of Disney Cruise Line in February 2018. Anthony Connelly assumed the role of president in October 2017. The Canaveral Port Authority Board of Commissioners in January 2019 approved work for Disney&#x27;s Terminal 8 and adjacent Terminal 10, which would handle more ships when the new class arrived.

With the October 2017 cruise of &quot;Disney Magic&quot; from New York to the Bahamas, the cruise line held its first Marvel Day at Sea. In October 2018, the cruise line began showing &quot;Disney at Sea with D23&quot;, a 30-minute entertainment news show that covers the many Disney subsidiaries with input from D23, starting with the ship.

=== Disney Signature Experiences unit ===
Soon after a March 2018 conglomerate reorganized the Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment division, Disney Cruise Line and New Vacation Operations were renamed Disney Signature Experiences along with Jeff Vahle being names as the new president.

Disney Cruise Line purchased in early March 2019 another Bahamas destination, the Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point property on the island of Eleuthera from the Bahamian Government. The cruise line was looking for another Bahamas location since the announcement of the third ship expansion in 2016.

In 2020, Jeff Vahle transitioned to become the president of Walt Disney World Resort. Cruise industry and Disney veteran Thomas Mazloum was then announced as the new president of Disney Cruise Line and Disney Signature Experiences. In 2025, Mazloum became the new Disneyland Resort President and Joe Schott was announced as the new President of Disney Cruise Line under Disney Signature Experiences. 

In February 2020, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot; moved its home port to New Orleans. From March 14, 2020 until July 2021, Disney Cruise Line ships suspended operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sailings resumed in the form of &quot;Staycation Cruises&quot;, closed loop cruises of 2 to 4 nights from the United Kingdom ports of Liverpool, Southampton, Newcastle, and Tilbury for London.

== Fleet ==
Disney Cruise Line currently operates six ships, with three more set to join in the coming years. As of January 2025, all of Disney Cruise Line&#x27;s ships are officially registered in Nassau, Bahamas. It is expected that &quot;Disney Adventure&quot; will be the first ship of the Disney Cruise Line to be registered in Singapore. The Disney Adventure cruise ship is scheduled to commence operations from Singapore on December 15, 2025. There are six vessels in the current fleet: &quot;Disney Magic&quot;, &quot;Disney Wonder&quot;, &quot;Disney Dream&quot;, &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Disney Wish&quot;, and &quot;Disney Treasure&quot;. Two vessels will be added in the near future: &quot;Disney Destiny&quot; (November 20, 2025), and &quot;Disney Adventure&quot; (December 15, 2025), in addition to four as-of-yet unnamed vessels.

In July 2024, The Oriental Land Company ordered a fourth &quot;Wish&quot;-class vessel, licensed by Disney, for a planned completion date in 2028.

An additional four ships were ordered from the German Meyer Werft shipyard in August 2024. They are planned for delivery between 2027 and 2031, which would bring the fleet to a total of 13 ships. The shipyard claimed that it was the highest value order they had ever received.

It was confirmed in January 2025 that the four new ships ordered in August 2024 would consist of an additional Wish-class ship, scheduled for delivery in 2027, and three new ships, sized in between the Magic- and Dream-class vessels.

=== Disney Cruise Line Terminals ===
==== Port Canaveral ====
Port Canaveral&#x27;s Cruise Terminal 8 is located in Port Canaveral in Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States. It is used to transport passengers on and off of the Disney Cruise Line ships. This port has seen the departure of the &quot;Disney Magic&quot;, the &quot;Disney Wonder&quot;, the &quot;Disney Dream&quot;, the &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot;, the &quot;Disney Wish,&quot; and the &quot;Disney Treasure&quot;.

The terminal is a large building owned by Port Canaveral and operated by Disney Cruise Line. At , this massive building includes the base for Disney Cruise Line check-in, security, and boarding. The terminal was designed loosely on the old Ocean Terminal in Southampton.

Disney Cruise Line had negotiated with the Port Canaveral port authority in early 2009 to extend their contract until 2022. As part of this contract, the port authority expanded and upgraded the dock in order to accommodate the new ships (both of which will be home-ported there), the terminal was enlarged to accommodate more passengers and luggage, and a parking garage was built. In 2019, a new contract agreement of 20 years was negotiated.

In June 2018, Port Canaveral officials approved pursuing a study about how to best upgrade Disney&#x27;s Terminal 8 and other nearby terminals. With the Disney fleet expected to expand with more ships, Port Canaveral Chief Executive Officer John Murray stated that, without expansion, &quot;we&#x27;ll have more activity than Terminal 8 can handle&quot;. The Canaveral Port Authority Board of Commissioners in January 2019 approved work for Disney&#x27;s Terminal 8 and adjacent Terminal 10, which would handle more ships when the new Wish-class ships arrive. The upgrades would allow Disney to base three ships year round at the port. The current plan sees two ships at Terminal 8 and one ship at Terminal 10.

==== Port Everglades ====
In April 2022, it was approved by the Broward County Commission that Port Everglades&#x27; Cruise Terminal 4 would be transformed into a second homeport for Disney Cruise Line, alongside Disney&#x27;s original homeport. This marked the first time that Disney Cruise Line sailed from Port Everglades. DCL markets the departure point as &quot;Fort Lauderdale&quot;. This port began embarking guests on November 20, 2023. &quot;Disney Magic&quot; is currently homeported at Port Everglades. The full-time ship is currently slated to be changed to the upcoming Disney Destiny, which will begin sailing at the end of 2025.

The terminal is owned by Broward County and operated by Disney Cruise Line. The building is and includes passenger check-in, security, and boarding, as well as a 1,818-space parking garage. The terminal&#x27;s exterior design is based on Disney&#x27;s original homeport, while the interior features a &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; theme.

Disney Cruise Line has negotiated with Broward County for a contract agreement of 15 years with options for three 5-year extensions. The agreement also includes one ship to be homeported year-round as well as a second seasonal ship in 2025. 

=== Disney&#x27;s Castaway Cay ===

Disney&#x27;s Castaway Cay, or simply Castaway Cay, is a private island in the Bahamas which serves as an exclusive port for the Disney Cruise Line ships. It is located near Great Abaco Island and was formerly known as Gorda Cay. In 1997, The Walt Disney Company purchased a 99-year land lease (through 2096) for the cay from the Bahamian government, giving the company substantial control over the island.

=== Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point ===

Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point, or simply Lookout Cay, is a private peninsula in the Bahamas which serves as an exclusive port for the Disney Cruise Line ships. It is located in the south-eastern region of Bannerman Town, Eleuthera. In March 2019, The Walt Disney Company purchased the peninsula from the Bahamian government, giving the company control over the area.

<text>KXRM-TV (channel 21) is a television station in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside low-power CW owned-and-operated station KXTU-LD (channel 57). The two stations share studios on Wooten Road in Colorado Springs; KXRM-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Cheyenne Mountain.

==History==
KXRM-TV first signed on the air as an independent station on January 22, 1985. Its call letters were chosen in part to reflect the region in which it operates and its original intent of classic family friendly programing, current and classic cartoon programing mixed with Christian teaching and talk shows. The first two letters stand for &quot;Khrist&quot; (Jesus Christ) &quot;Xalted&quot; (Exalted) and the last two letters stand for &quot;Rocky Mountains&quot;. The station had hoped to sign on Christmas Eve 1984, but technical glitches prevented that from happening. KXRM was Southern Colorado&#x27;s first independent station, and the region&#x27;s first commercial television station since KRDO-TV signed on 31 years earlier. KXRM-TV became one of the initial group of independent television stations to agree to affiliate with the Fox Broadcasting Company in 1986 and had remained an affiliate of the network ever since.

The station was locally owned until 2000 when it was bought by Raycom Media. After Raycom merged with the Liberty Corporation, KXRM was one of several stations that were spun off to Barrington Broadcasting.

On October 11, 2007, the station began airing programming from the Retro Television Network (RTV) on its second digital subchannel. Previously, this aired The Tube (a 24-hour music channel) until the network suspended operations on October 1. On September 15, 2008, KXRM replaced RTV programming on 21.2 with a simulcast of KXTU. This signal increases KXTU&#x27;s broadcasting radius; KXTU did not convert to digital until 2010, and even in digital, its coverage area is effectively limited to El Paso and Pueblo counties.

On February 28, 2013, Barrington Broadcasting announced the sale of its entire group, including KXRM-TV, to Sinclair Broadcast Group. The sale was completed on November 25. On August 20, 2014, Sinclair announced that it would sell KXRM-TV and KXTU-LD, along with WTTA in Tampa Bay and WHTM in Harrisburg (which Sinclair, on behalf of Allbritton is planning on to divest) to Media General in a swap for WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island, the WLUK-TV and WCWF duopoly in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and WTGS in Savannah, Georgia. The swap was part of Media General&#x27;s merger with LIN Media. WHTM&#x27;s sale of Media General was explored nearly two months earlier, and it was completed, nearly three months before the Media General/LIN deal was completed. The sale was completed on December 19. On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. KXRM became part of &quot;Nexstar Media Group&quot; as Nexstar&#x27;s second station in Colorado, joining Grand Junction&#x27;s CBS affiliate KREX-TV, along with their sister Fox station KFQX through their JSA with Mission Broadcasting. The deal was approved by the FCC on January 11, 2017, and it was completed on January 17. Nexstar would then acquire Tribune Media and their Denver duopoly of CW affiliate KWGN-TV and Fox affiliate KDVR, thus consolidating full control over the Fox stations across Colorado.

==News operation==
Currently, KXRM broadcasts 43 hours of local news each week (with hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays). It has the highest local newscast output among all broadcast television stations in the Colorado Springs–Pueblo market.

The station began airing a half hour prime time newscast at 9 p.m. on March 11, 2001, that was produced by local CBS affiliate KKTV. KXRM established its own in-house news department in 2006 and expanded the nighty 9 p.m. newscast to a full hour. The station hosts a morning show (first started in 2007 as a three-hour newscast) that currently runs from 5 to 9 a.m. that has been recognized by the Colorado Broadcasters Association as one of the best morning shows in the market. On January 20, 2016, a 10 p.m. newscast was added for weeknights. KXRM also airs weekend morning newscasts running from 5 to 7 a.m. on Saturdays and 6 to 8 a.m. on Sundays. The Saturday evening newscasts run a half hour from 9 to 9:30 p.m., and the Sunday night newscasts run an hour from 9 to 10 p.m.

In late September 2010, KXRM became the fourth station in Colorado Springs–Pueblo to start broadcasting its local newscasts in 16:9 widescreen.

In 2013, the Radio Television Digital News Association recognized KXRM with a National Edward R. Murrow Award for continuing coverage of the Waldo Canyon Fire.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KXRM-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 21, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22, using virtual channel 21.

As part of the SAFER Act, KXRM kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

<doc id="948548" wikidata="Q1049545" url="?curid=948548" title="Clash of the Titans (1981 film)">
<text>Clash of the Titans is a 1981 epic fantasy adventure film directed by Desmond Davis and written by Beverley Cross, loosely based on the Greek myth of Perseus. Starring Harry Hamlin, Judi Bowker, Burgess Meredith, Maggie Smith and Laurence Olivier, the film features the final work of stop-motion visual effects artist Ray Harryhausen.

Co-produced between the United States and United Kingdom, it was theatrically released on June 12, 1981, and grossed $41 million at the North American box office, making it the eleventh-highest grossing film of the year. A novelization by Alan Dean Foster was also published in 1981. A 3D remake of the same name was released by Warner Bros. on April 2, 2010.

== Plot ==

King Acrisius of Argos imprisons his daughter Danaë, jealous of her beauty. When the god Zeus impregnates Danaë, Acrisius banishes her and her newborn son Perseus to sea in a wooden chest. In retribution, Zeus kills Acrisius and orders Poseidon to release the last of the Titans, a gigantic sea monster called the Kraken, to destroy Argos. Danaë and Perseus safely float to the island of Seriphos, where Perseus grows to adulthood.

Calibos, the spoiled son of the sea goddess Thetis, is betrothed to Princess Andromeda, daughter of Queen Cassiopeia of Joppa; but for committing several atrocities, including destroying Zeus&#x27; sacred flying horses (except for Pegasus), Calibos is transformed into a deformed monster to fit the ugliness of his cold heart.

In revenge, Thetis transports an adult Perseus to an abandoned amphitheater in Joppa, where he befriends a soldier, Thallo, and an elderly poet named Ammon. Perseus learns that Andromeda is under a curse and cannot marry unless her suitor successfully answers a riddle concocted by Calibos. Zeus sends Perseus a god-crafted helmet which is from Athena which makes its wearer invisible, a magical sword which is from Aphrodite, and a shield which is from Hera. After capturing Pegasus, Perseus follows Calibos&#x27;s giant vulture carrying off Andromeda&#x27;s spirit during her sleep to learn the next riddle. Perseus is discovered and nearly killed by Calibos. In the ensuing fight, Calibos loses his left hand, and Perseus loses his helmet.

The next morning, Perseus presents himself as a suitor and correctly answers the riddle—the answer is the ring given to Calibos by his mother which is still attached to the amputated hand—winning Andromeda&#x27;s hand in marriage. Finding out that Thetis cannot act against Perseus, Calibos instead demands that she take vengeance on Joppa.

At the wedding in Thetis&#x27; temple, Cassiopeia declares that Andromeda&#x27;s beauty is greater than Thetis&#x27;. Thetis, using the statue&#x27;s head to speak through, declares that Cassiopeia will pay for her boasting and for the injury inflicted on Calibos and demands that Andromeda will be sacrificed to the Kraken on pain of Joppa&#x27;s destruction.

Perseus seeks a way to defeat the Kraken. However, Pegasus is captured by Calibos and his men. Zeus commands Athena to give Perseus her owl Bubo, but she refuses. Instead, she orders Hephaestus to build a mechanical replica that leads Perseus, Andromeda, Ammon, Thallo, and some soldiers to the Stygian Witches. By taking their magic eye, Perseus forces them to reveal that the only way to defeat the Kraken is by using the head of the Gorgon Medusa, whose gaze can turn any living thing into stone. Medusa lives on an island in the River Styx at the edge of the Underworld. The next day, Perseus and the soldiers continue on their journey while Andromeda and Ammon return to Joppa.

On the Gorgon&#x27;s island, the three soldiers traveling with Perseus are killed. Perseus fights and kills Medusa&#x27;s guardian, a two-headed dog named Dioskilos. At the Gorgon&#x27;s lair, Perseus uses the reflective underside of his shield to deceive Medusa, decapitate her, and collect her head. However, Perseus&#x27;s shield is dissolved by her caustic blood. As Perseus and his fellow soldiers set to return, Calibos enters their camp and punctures the cloak carrying Medusa&#x27;s head, causing her blood to spill and produce three giant scorpions. Calibos and the three scorpions attack and kill Perseus&#x27;s remaining escorts. Alone, Perseus overcomes the three scorpions and kills Calibos.

Weakened by his struggle, Perseus sends Bubo to rescue Pegasus from Calibos&#x27; henchmen. After reaching the amphitheater in Joppa, Perseus collapses from exhaustion. Andromeda is shackled to the sacrificial rock outside Joppa, and the Kraken is summoned. Bubo distracts the beast until Perseus, whose strength was secretly restored by Zeus, appears on Pegasus. Using Medusa&#x27;s head, Perseus petrifies the Kraken, causing it to crumble to pieces. Then Perseus tosses the head into the sea, frees Andromeda, and marries Andromeda.

The gods predict that Perseus and Andromeda will live happily, rule wisely, and produce children, and Zeus forbids the other gods to pursue vengeance against them. The constellations of Perseus, Andromeda, Pegasus and Cassiopeia are created in their honor.

==Production==
The film was the idea of writer Beverley Cross. In 1978, Andor Films submitted a copy of the script to the British Board of Film Classification, seeking advice on how to secure either a &quot;U&quot; or an &quot;A&quot; certificate. The draft script included scenes that the BBFC considered would be unacceptable under those certificates, including the Kraken tearing Pegasus to pieces and Andromeda appearing naked during the climax of the film. Changes to the script and, on submission, some cuts to Perseus&#x27;s final battle with Calibos were made and the film secured the &quot;A&quot; certificate: &quot;Those aged 5 and older admitted, but not recommended for children under 14 years of age&quot;.

Ray Harryhausen used stop-motion animation to create the various creatures in the film, including Calibos, his vulture, Pegasus, Bubo the mechanical owl, Dioskilos, Medusa, the scorpions and the Kraken. Stephen R. Wilk wrote that though the film&#x27;s story &quot;sticks closer to its sources than any other interpretation&quot;, one of the creative liberties taken is Medusa&#x27;s biology, which differs from &quot;any previous representations, ancient or modern&quot;, with the lower body of a snake rather than legs. Harryhausen’s Medusa has been called &quot;one of the most recognizable characters in model-animation cinema history.&quot; Two identical models of Bubo the mechanical owl were made: one that contained remote controlled motors that allowed it to move when handled by the actor, and a stop-motion model because the movements of the live action model were more limited. Roger Ebert called &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; Harryhausen&#x27;s &quot;masterwork&quot;. Harryhausen was also co-producer of the film, and retired from film-making shortly after it was released. Despite Bubo&#x27;s similarities to the droid R2-D2 of the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Harryhausen claimed Bubo was created before &quot;Star Wars&quot; was released. The BBFC, reviewing the film for certification in 1981, said Harryhausen&#x27;s effects were well done and would give entertainment to audiences of all ages, but might appear a little &quot;old hat&quot; to those familiar with &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;. The stop-motion troglodyte figurine used in &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot; (1977) was cannibalized to make Calibos.
Columbia Pictures were initially set to distribute the film having made most of Harryhausen and producer Charles H. Schneer&#x27;s films, but after a change of guard at the studio, they dropped the project during pre-production, saying it was too expensive. Schneer took it to Orion Pictures who insisted on Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the lead but the producer refused as the role involved too much dialogue. He then tried Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who agreed to finance. &quot;They loved the material, they loved the picture, and they were wonderful to us,&quot; said Schneer. &quot;As I put the film together and the castings came up, they approved the additional castings and added that expense to the budget.&quot;

Schneer deliberately sought better known actors to play the Gods to improve the film&#x27;s chances at the box office. &quot;If we had played this picture with no recognised actors it might be assumed to be what it isn&#x27;t. It might suffer the fate of an Italian Western.&quot; The scenes involving the Gods only took eight days. Claire Bloom said she only agreed to make it &quot;because I was told Olivier was doing it and it only lasts a week.&quot;

MGM overruled Schneer&#x27;s choice of John Gielgud to portray the playwright Ammon, and asked for Burgess Meredith to be cast instead. &quot;I saw the sense in that,&quot; said Schneer. &quot;They preferred an American actor. They didn&#x27;t want the public to think it was totally an English picture.&quot;

Schneer chose Desmond Davis as director in part because Davis had made several BBC Shakespeare films and he wanted someone with experience dealing with Shakespearean actors.

Stars Harry Hamlin and Ursula Andress were romantically involved at the time of production. Their son, Dimitri, was born in 1980 after filming was completed, and their relationship ended in 1983.

Jack Gwillim, who appeared as Poseidon, had earlier played the role of King Aeëtes in the original &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; in 1963.

The film&#x27;s screenwriter, Beverley Cross, was married to Maggie Smith, who played Thetis, until his death in 1998. Cross worked with producer Charles H. Schneer before, writing the screenplay for Schneer&#x27;s production of &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;.

===Locations===
The film was shot at the Albert R. Broccoli 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios, United Kingdom, with locations including Cornwall, UK, and Paestum, Italy.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; was released on June 12, 1981 and grossed $6,565,347 from 1,127 theaters in its opening weekend, second behind &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; at the U.S. box office, which was released on the same date. By the time it finished its theatrical run, it had grossed $41 million in North America. The film had a worldwide gross of over $70 million and was one of 1981&#x27;s biggest hits.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 50 reviews, and an average rating of 6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A goofy, old-school sword-and-sandal epic, &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; mines Greek mythology for its story and fleshes it out with Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s charmingly archaic stop-motion animation techniques.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half out of four stars and called it &quot;a grand and glorious romantic adventure, filled with brave heroes, beautiful heroines, fearsome monsters, and awe-inspiring duels to the death. It is a lot of fun.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film three and a half stars out of four and called it &quot;a special effects spectacular that succeeds brilliantly as an old-fashioned adventure film based on the legends of Greek mythology.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an unbearable bore of a film that will probably put to sleep the few adults stuck taking the kids to it. This mythical tale of Perseus, son of Zeus, and his quest for the &#x27;fair&#x27; Andromeda, is mired in a slew of corny dialog and an endless array of flat, outdated special effects that are both a throwback to a bad 1950s picture.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Though not very witty, the adventures are many and involve a lot of Mr. Harryhausen&#x27;s specialities,&quot; though he thought the monsters were &quot;less convincing than interesting.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that the film &quot;has charm, it has imagination, but it is also too often stodgy. It is an instance of the whole not being nearly as good as its parts. However, Harryhausen&#x27;s contributions do delight, and this may be more than enough for his ardent admirers and most youngsters.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Hamlin was &quot;always a magnetic presence&quot; but the film&#x27;s appeal was &quot;quaint and stilted.&quot; Geoff Brown of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the film &quot;unfortunately fails to shake much dust off the genre ... Despite the producers&#x27; protracted labours, there&#x27;s a real possibility that some audiences will be turned to stone before Medusa shows up.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; stated &quot;The real titan is Ray Harryhausen.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #9 and commented that &quot;&quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; is still one of Harryhausen&#x27;s best works. It has a decent script, a fine cast, and a lot of good effects. The problem lies in the little things. If, in truth, it was to be a clash of the titans, then that is who should have been featured; it should have been either the gods&#x27; or Perseus&#x27; story, not both. The film falls between two schools... and even Harryhausen can&#x27;t save it no matter how excellent his magic.&quot;

In a book published in 2000, Stephen R. Wilk suggested that &quot;most people today who are aware of the story of Perseus and Medusa owe their knowledge to&quot; the film.

==Legacy==
The four-issue comic book miniseries &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot; (2007), released by TidalWave Productions as part of their Ray Harryhausen Signature Series, picked up the story 5 years after the events of the film.

Harry Hamlin reprised his role as Perseus for the video game &quot;God of War II&quot; (2007).

The 3D remake &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (2010) and its sequel &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot; (2012) were released by the property&#x27;s current rights holder Warner Bros. (through Turner Entertainment Co., WB&#x27;s sister company) The Kraken would appear in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; as one of the villains rallied by the Joker to destroy Gotham City. Bubo made an appearance in &quot;The Trouble with Truth&quot;, an episode of the animated series &quot;Justice League Action&quot;.

<text>Aldor is a programming language. It is the successor of A# as the extension language of the Axiom computer algebra system.

Aldor combines imperative, functional, and object-oriented features. It has an elaborate type system, allowing types to be used as first-class values. Aldor&#x27;s syntax is heavily influenced by Pascal, but it is optionally indentation-sensitive, using whitespace characters and the off-side rule, like Python. In its current implementation, it is compiled, but an interactive listener is provided.

Aldor is distributed as free and open-source software, under the Apache License 2.0.

== Examples ==

The Hello world program looks like this:

#include &quot;aldor&quot;

<text>KWGN-TV (channel 2) is a television station in Denver, Colorado, United States, serving as the local CW outlet. It is owned and operated by network majority owner Nexstar Media Group alongside Fox affiliate KDVR, channel 31 (and its Fort Collins–licensed satellite KFCT, channel 22). The two stations share studios on East Speer Boulevard in Denver&#x27;s Speer neighborhood; KWGN-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Lookout Mountain, near Golden.

KWGN is available to subscribers of satellite provider Dish Network throughout the United States as part of its superstations package (for grandfathered subscribers that purchased the a la carte tier before Dish halted sales of the package to new subscribers in September 2013), and is carried on cable television providers in parts of the western United States. The station is authorized for cable and satellite distribution as a U.S. superstation by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC); however, KWGN is not currently available on any pay television providers in that country.

==History==

===Early years===
The station first signed on the air as KFEL-TV on July 18, 1952. It was owned by Colorado broadcasting pioneer Gene O&#x27;Fallon along with KFEL radio (AM 950, now KKSE), and was the first television station to sign on in the state of Colorado. It was also first station on the VHF band to sign on the air following the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s decision to lift its freeze on television station licenses that year. The station originally operated as a primary affiliate of the DuMont Television Network, sharing the affiliation with KBTV (channel 9, now NBC affiliate KUSA), but also cherry-picked programs from NBC, ABC and CBS. The station&#x27;s original studio facilities were located in a remodeled brick warehouse at 550 Lincoln Street.

Gotham Broadcasting, owned by J. Elroy McCaw (who also owned radio station WINS in New York City), purchased the station from O&#x27;Fallon in 1955. John M. Shaheen, the founder of aviation services company Tele-Trip Inc., which later became a subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha, subsequently acquired a 50% ownership interest in the station. Channel 2&#x27;s call letters were changed that same year to KTVR; the station lost the DuMont affiliation when the network shut down on August 6, 1956, after which it became an independent station. During the late 1950s, the station was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. In 1959, McCaw became the sole owner of channel 2, buying out Shaheen&#x27;s share in the station. In 1963, McCaw changed the call letters to KCTO (for &quot;Channel Two&quot;).

===Under Tribune ownership===
In September 1965, the station was acquired by Tribune Broadcasting – then known as WGN Continental Broadcasting. After the sale was finalized in March 1966, the new owners changed the call letters to KWGN-TV after its new sister station and the company&#x27;s flagship, WGN-TV in Chicago (the WGN calls refer to the longtime slogan of the company&#x27;s former flagship newspaper, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot;; the newspaper division was split into a separate company in August 2014). At the time of its purchase, KWGN became Tribune&#x27;s fourth television station property—after WGN-TV, WPIX in New York City, and KDAL-TV (now KDLH) in Duluth, Minnesota, the latter of which was owned by Tribune from 1960 to 1978.

When WGN Continental Broadcasting bought channel 2, it gave the station a significant technical overhaul, allowing it to broadcast programming in color. KWGN promoted itself as Colorado&#x27;s only all-color station, because all of its local programs were produced in the format. Denver&#x27;s three major network affiliates—KOA-TV (channel 4, now KCNC-TV), KLZ-TV (channel 7, now KMGH-TV) and KBTV—were broadcasting national network programs in color, but had yet to equip their studios with color cameras for local programming production. As an independent station, KWGN aired a mix of off-network sitcoms and dramas, cartoons, movies, syndicated game shows and locally produced programs such as &quot;Blinky&#x27;s Fun Club&quot;, &quot;Denver Now&quot;, &quot;Afternoon at the Movies with Tom Shannon&quot; and public affairs program &quot;Your Right to Say It&quot;. It took six years for WGN Continental to make the station profitable.

Beginning in the 1960s, the station started building a massive network of translators across the state. Around this time, KWGN became a regional superstation (long before that term was coined and popularized by Atlanta station WTBS). At its height, it was available on nearly every cable system in Colorado and Wyoming, as well as portions of Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah and Washington. KWGN was attractive to cable systems because its programming had no duplication with programs seen on the local network affiliates within their given markets. Additionally, it was the only independent station that was available in much of the region until the 1980s. It remained the only independent station in Denver—and indeed, in all of Colorado—until eventual sister station KDVR (channel 31) signed on in August 1983. To this day, KWGN remains available on most cable systems in Colorado and Wyoming, as well as on several systems in western Nebraska and Kansas.

The station moved its operations from the Lincoln Street facility to a new building in suburban Greenwood Village in 1983. As one of the strongest independent stations in the country, KWGN was approached by Fox to affiliate with the upstart network upon its October 1986 debut. However, channel 2 turned the offer down. Station and company officials were skeptical of Fox&#x27;s business model, and were confident enough in KWGN&#x27;s schedule that they felt they didn&#x27;t need a network affiliation. However, most Fox affiliates were essentially programmed as independents until the network began airing a full week&#x27;s worth of programming in 1993, so KWGN would not have had to give up many of its syndicated shows. Additionally, by this time, most of the smaller markets in its vast cable footprint had enough stations to provide Fox affiliates at the outset, making the prospect of KWGN as a multi-state Fox affiliate unattractive to Tribune. The affiliation instead went to KDVR.

===WB affiliation===
On November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. Television division of Time Warner and the Tribune Company announced the creation of The WB Television Network; KWGN and the majority of Tribune&#x27;s other independent stations (except for Atlanta&#x27;s WGNX, which joined CBS one month prior to The WB&#x27;s launch) were tapped to serve as the nuclei for the new network. KWGN became a charter affiliate of The WB when it launched on January 11, 1995; however, its existing lineup was largely unaffected at first, since The WB initially ran programming only on Wednesday evenings, gradually adding additional nights of programming between September 1995 and September 1999; by that time, the network offered prime time programming on Sunday through Friday evenings, along with children&#x27;s programming on weekdays and Saturday mornings.

In October 1995, Fox Television Stations proposed a divestiture of KDVR (which it had acquired from Renaissance Broadcasting three months earlier in exchange for its former owned-and-operated station in Dallas, KDAF (now a sister station to KWGN), which had lost Fox programming to that market&#x27;s longtime CBS affiliate, KDFW, in a groupwide affiliation deal with Fox and then-KDFW owner, New World Communications) to Qwest Broadcasting, a company backed by Quincy Jones and Tribune Broadcasting; in the sale proposal, Fox would have moved its programming to KWGN, while the WB affiliation would have moved to KDVR after the sale to Qwest was finalized. However, this deal never came to fruition.

In 1996, the station altered its longstanding &quot;Denver&#x27;s 2&quot; branding to &quot;Denver&#x27;s WB2&quot;, to reflect its network affiliation; the &quot;WB2&quot; branding continued to be used in some form for the remainder of KWGN&#x27;s tenure with the network. During its existence as a WB affiliate, KWGN also served as the network&#x27;s default affiliate for most of Colorado, including the Colorado Springs–Pueblo and Grand Junction markets—a status that was reflected under the &quot;WB2 Colorado&quot; moniker that was used during the final years of The WB&#x27;s run.

===CW affiliation===

On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the respective programming from the two networks to create a new &quot;fifth&quot; network called The CW. With the announcement, Tribune Broadcasting signed ten-year agreements for KWGN and 16 of the company&#x27;s 18 other WB-affiliated stations (three of which it would sell to other groups shortly before The CW launched) to become charter affiliates of The CW. In preparation for the affiliation switch, the station retitled its newscasts from &quot;WB 2 News&quot; to &quot;News 2&quot; on August 14, 2006. The affiliation switch took place on September 18, 2006, the day after The WB ended operations, upon which it changed its general branding to &quot;CW 2&quot; (former UPN affiliate KTVD (channel 20) would end up affiliating with MyNetworkTV, whose launch was announced by News Corporation nearly one month after the CW launch announcement on February 22).

On July 7, 2008, KWGN removed references to its CW affiliation from its branding in both station promotions and its on-air logo, as part of a decision by Tribune Broadcasting to de-emphasize the network brand from its CW-affiliated stations as a result of the network&#x27;s relatively weak ratings, choosing to reposition them as more &quot;local&quot; stations; KWGN began referring to itself simply as &quot;2&quot;, featuring the CW branding era&#x27;s &quot;2&quot; logotype within a solid circle logo.

====LMA and legal duopoly with KDVR====
On September 17, 2008, Tribune Company announced that it would enter KWGN into a local marketing agreement with Local TV, owners of Fox affiliate KDVR, effective on October 1, 2008, as a result of the formation of a &quot;broadcast management company&quot; that was created to provide management services to stations owned by both Tribune Broadcasting and Local TV. Although it was the longer-established of the two stations, KWGN served as the junior partner in the virtual duopoly. As a result, the station would migrate its operations into KDVR&#x27;s studio facility on Speer Boulevard in downtown Denver (based at the same location where KWGN&#x27;s original studios were located during the station&#x27;s first 30 years on the air). The move resulted in both stations combining their news departments and sharing certain syndicated programming.

On March 30, 2009, KWGN changed its on-air branding once again to &quot;2 the Deuce&quot;, in an attempt to appeal to younger viewers and become more involved in local issues. On March 1, 2010, the locally produced talk show &quot;Everyday with Libby and Natalie&quot; (which debuted in 2008) was renamed as simply &quot;Everyday&quot; and moved to KWGN from KDVR (effectively changing timeslots as a result moving from late afternoons to late mornings with the program&#x27;s station switch); Libby Weaver co-hosted the program with Natalie Tysdal until June 1, 2009, after which Weaver was replaced by Chris Parente. After Peter Maroney took over as general manager of KDVR/KWGN following the 2009 departure of Dennis Leonard, other noticeable changes to the station took hold with the locally produced consumer talk program &quot;Martino TV&quot; (which also moved to KDVR) being replaced in its 11 a.m. timeslot by repeats of &quot;Maury&quot;.

In May 2010, KWGN dropped &quot;The Deuce&quot; branding and temporarily began to simply identify by the station&#x27;s call letters. The following month, the station changed its website domain from 2thedeuce.com to KWGN.com to reflect the branding change; that September, the station rebranded itself as &quot;Channel 2, The CW&quot;. That fall, the station dropped &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot; from its schedule, which moved to sister station KDVR; this left WGN-TV (which itself lost rights to the talk show in September 2013) and St. Louis sister station KPLR-TV as the only Tribune-owned stations and two of the few CW affiliates that carry the show. On July 22, 2011, KWGN debuted a new on-air appearance and branding (becoming known as &quot;Colorado&#x27;s Own Channel 2&quot;, resembling the former &quot;Denver&#x27;s 2&quot; identity from the 1980s and early 1990s plus the “Chicago’s Very Own” slogan used by WGN-TV), as well as reformatting its local news programming to a more traditional format. On July 1, 2013, Tribune announced it would purchase Local TV outright for $2.75 billion. The sale was finalized on December 27, creating a legal duopoly between KDVR and KWGN.

====Sinclair purchase attempt; sale to Nexstar====
In May 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media. KDVR was then identified as one of 23 stations that Sinclair would divest to obtain regulatory approval for the merger, with Fox Television Stations agreeing to a repurchase as part of a $910 million deal. Both transactions were nullified on August 9, 2018, following Tribune Media&#x27;s termination of the merger agreement and FCC chairman Ajit Pai&#x27;s public rejection of the deal.

Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal closed on September 19, 2019.

==Programming==
===Sports coverage===
KWGN served as the over-the-air flagship home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Colorado Rockies from their inaugural season in 1993 to 2002 and the NBA&#x27;s Denver Nuggets in 1990–91 and again from 1995 to 2004.

===News operation===
KWGN-TV presently broadcasts 36 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). There is a considerable amount of sharing between KWGN and KDVR in regards to news coverage, video footage and the use of reporters; though both outlets maintain their own primary on-air personalities (such as news anchors and meteorologists) that only appear on one station; several KWGN on-air staffers that remained with the station after the LMA was formed simultaneously joined KDVR&#x27;s news department with the consolidation of news operations. Combined with sister KDVR, Nexstar&#x27;s Denver properties broadcasts a combined 90 hours of local news, making it the highest output in the state of Colorado.

Channel 2 was the first television station in the Denver market to air a locally produced nightly prime time newscast. The 9 p.m. newscast, which debuted shortly after the station signed on, remained a constant through several ownership changes. In 1966, the newscast was expanded to one hour—becoming the only hour-long newscast in the market at that point. Titled &quot;The Big News&quot;, the program heavily concentrated on local stories because filmed national and international news reports were not available through news feeds to stations that lacked a network affiliation during that period. If a major national story occurred, anchor Ron Voigt would read the wire copy while black-and-white wire photos supplied by the Associated Press were shown on-camera.

From the late 1960s until 1975, &quot;The Big News&quot; had two regular commentators to provide news analysis, George Salem and Gene Amole. The final segment of the newscast was titled &quot;Speak Out&quot; and was often devoted to phone calls from viewers. The program was also known for its meteorologist, Ed Bowman (known as &quot;Weatherman Bowman&quot;), who came to KWGN from KOA-TV-AM. Bowman frequently discussed the jet stream during his forecast segment, which he represented on-air by drawing large arcs over a map of the continental United States. The station&#x27;s sports director during the 1960s and early 1970s was Fred Leo, who had provided play-by-play analysis for many of the area&#x27;s professional sports teams. KWGN&#x27;s newscast grew to be a strong competitor to the prime time network programs it competed against in the 9 p.m. timeslot on KBTV/KUSA, KOA-TV/KCNC and KLZ-TV/KMGH.

The first time that KWGN programmed news outside its established 9 p.m. slot was in 1982, when it premiered a midday newscast at noon. The station attempted another midday newscast beginning in 1997, this time at 11AM and running for an hour. &quot;WB2 News at Eleven&quot; lasted three years, and was cancelled in the fall of 2000. On July 16, 2000, legitimate competition sprang up for KWGN&#x27;s prime time newscast for the first time when KDVR debuted the hour-long &quot;Fox 31 News at 9 O&#x27;Clock&quot;, which gradually became an avid competitor to KWGN&#x27;s longer-established late newscast. Also in 2000, the station debuted a weekday morning newscast titled &quot;WB2day&quot; (which eventually adopted the present title &quot;Daybreak&quot; in 2012), a mix of news, entertainment and lifestyle features that initially aired for three hours from 6 to 9 a.m. In 2004, KWGN added an hour onto the newscast from 5 to 6 a.m., expanding it to four hours. The program grew to beat competing local and national morning news programs in certain age demographics. An 11 a.m. newscast returned to the schedule on September 11, 2006. On July 7, 2008, KWGN branched out its news programming into early evenings for the first time with the launch of a half-hour 5:30 p.m. newscast, anchored by Kellie MacMullan and Ernie Bjorkman. One month later on August 4, 2008, the station expanded its 11 a.m. newscast to one hour.

After entering into the local marketing agreement with KDVR, major changes were made to KWGN&#x27;s news programming. First on January 12, 2009, the station discontinued its 5:30 p.m. newscast as KDVR expanded its own early evening newscast to an hour starting at 5 p.m. On March 2, 2009, KWGN moved its newscasts to a temporary set in preparation for its March 30 move from its Greenwood Village facility to KDVR&#x27;s studios on Speer Boulevard. Subsequently, on March 30, when KWGN&#x27;s operations were formally integrated with KDVR, channel 2 shifted its flagship 9 p.m. newscast to 7 p.m. to avoid competing with KDVR&#x27;s prime time newscast; as a result, the newscast traded time slots with The CW&#x27;s prime time schedule, which the station began airing on a one-hour delay from 8 to 10 p.m. at the network&#x27;s permission (this also effectively resulted in the newscast being reduced to airing only on Monday through Friday evenings in part due to The CW airing a three-hour prime time lineup on Sundays at the time; although The CW turned its Sunday prime time slots over to the network&#x27;s affiliates in September 2009, the 7 p.m. newscast remains a weeknight-only broadcast ). KWGN discontinued the 11 a.m. newscast once again on May 29, 2009, which was replaced the following Monday with &quot;Martino TV&quot;, a lifestyle program featuring paid segments from local businesses. At that time, KWGN began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

On July 18, 2016, KWGN started a 4 p.m. weekday newscast. This newscast is anchored by current KWGN 7 p.m. anchor, Deborah Takahara, and longtime former Denver newsman Mike Landess. Mike returns to Denver from KYTX in Tyler, Texas. Landess previously anchored evening newscasts for KMGH and KUSA/KBTV in Denver.

On September 12, 2016, KWGN became the first station in the Mountain Time Zone to launch an 11 p.m. weeknight newscast hosted by Mike Barz and Erika Gonzalez.

Beginning March 27, 2017, Ernie Bjorkman, weeknight anchor from 1984 to 1988 and again from 1998 to 2008, returned to KWGN.

On September 23, 2017, KWGN expanded the hour-long 7 p.m. newscast to weekends for the first time since the newscast launched on March 30, 2009; this also marked the first time KWGN aired local news on weekends since 2009.

====Notable former on-air staff====
* Asha Blake – weeknight anchor (2004–2007; later at KTLA in Los Angeles)
* Tom Martino – consumer reporter and host of &quot;Martino TV&quot; (2009–2010)
* Russell Scott – host of &quot;Blinky&#x27;s Fun Club&quot; and &quot;Captain Dooley&quot; (1966–1998; deceased)
* Tom Shannon – host of &quot;Afternoon at the Movies with Tom Shannon&quot; (1970s)

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
KWGN-TV offers four subchannels, which since conversion to ATSC 3.0 have been hosted on the multiplexes of three other Denver television stations:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KWGN shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34, using virtual channel 2.

===ATSC 3.0===

On December 21, 2020, this station was launched as a lighthouse station for ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) in Denver. It currently carries the main program streams of KWGN, KMGH-TV, KUSA and KDVR.

<doc id="948561" wikidata="Q938642" url="?curid=948561" title="Goats Head Soup">
<text>Goats Head Soup is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 31 August 1973 by Rolling Stones Records. Like its predecessor &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, the band composed and recorded much of it outside of the United Kingdom due to their status as tax exiles. &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; was recorded in Jamaica, the United States and the United Kingdom. The album contains 10 tracks, including the lead single &quot;Angie&quot; which went to number one as a single in the US and the top five in the UK.

The album was the last to be produced by Jimmy Miller, who was a key architect of the Rolling Stones sound during their most acclaimed period which began with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;. Bass guitarist Bill Wyman appears on only three of the album&#x27;s ten tracks, but the rest of the Rolling Stones—lead vocalist Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Mick Taylor, and drummer Charlie Watts—play on every track, with the exception of &quot;Winter&quot;, which does not feature Richards. Regular Rolling Stones collaborators, including saxophonist Bobby Keys, organist Billy Preston, and pianists Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart, also feature.

&quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; achieved number one chart positions in the UK, US and several other world markets. However, it received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and is generally seen as the beginning of the band&#x27;s decline after a string of critically acclaimed albums. However, in recent times its reception has grown in stature. The band supported the album on a tour of Europe following its release. The album was remastered and released in 1994 and again in 2009 by Virgin Records and Universal Music respectively. It was remixed by Giles Martin for a 2020 reissue, including a deluxe edition with bonus tracks and unreleased outtakes. The re-issue returned the album to number one in the UK charts.

==Recording==
In November 1972 the band relocated to Dynamic Sounds studio in Kingston, Jamaica. Keith Richards said in 2002: &quot;Jamaica was one of the few places that would let us all in! By that time about the only country that I was allowed to exist in was Switzerland, which was damn boring for me, at least for the first year, because I didn&#x27;t like to ski ... Nine countries kicked me out, thank you very much, so it was a matter of how to keep this thing together ...&quot;

Of the recording process, Marshall Chess, the president of Rolling Stones Records at the time, said in 2002, &quot;We used to book studios for a month, 24 hours a day, so that the band could keep the same set-up and develop their songs in their free-form way, starting with a few lyrics and rhythms, jamming and rehearsing while we fixed the sound. It amazed me, as an old-time record guy, that the Stones might not have played together for six or eight months, but within an hour of jamming, the synergy that is their strength would come into play and they would lock it together as one ...&quot;

Jagger said of their approach to recording at the time, &quot;Songwriting and playing is a mood. Like the last album we did (&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;) was basically recorded in short concentrated periods. Two weeks here, two weeks there – then another two weeks. And, similarly, all the writing was concentrated so that you get the feel of one particular period of time. Three months later it&#x27;s all very different and we won&#x27;t be writing the same kind of material as &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;.&quot;

On the sessions and influence of the island, Richards said, &quot;The album itself didn&#x27;t take that long, but we recorded an awful lot of tracks. There were not only Jamaicans involved, but also percussion players who came from places like Guyana, a travelling pool of guys who worked in the studios. It was interesting to be playing in this totally different atmosphere. Mikey Chung, the engineer at Dynamic, for example, was a Chinese man – you realise how much Jamaica is a multi-ethnic environment.&quot; The album title is believed to be a reference to the Jamaican dish mannish water.

The first track recorded at Dynamic was &quot;Winter&quot;, which Mick Taylor said started with &quot;just Mick (Jagger) strumming on a guitar in the studio, and everything falling together from there&quot;. The main theme of the lyrics of the song go back to a 1968 outtake &quot;Blood Red Wine&quot;. The song is also the only song on the album that does not feature Richards as a performer, with the electric rhythm guitar being played by Jagger. Mick Taylor would later record longer versions of &quot;Winter&quot; with Carla Olson for her &quot;The Ring of Truth&quot; album and &quot;Silver Train&quot; for their &quot;Too Hot for Snakes&quot; album.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Angie&quot;, was an unpopular choice as lead single with Atlantic Records which, according to Chess, &quot;wanted another &#x27;Brown Sugar&#x27; rather than a ballad&quot;. Although the song was rumoured to be about David Bowie&#x27;s first wife Angela, both Jagger and Richards have consistently denied this. In 1993, Richards, in the liner notes to the compilation album &quot;Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones&quot;, said that the title was inspired by his baby daughter, Dandelion Angela. However, in his 2010 memoir &quot;Life&quot;, Richards denied this, saying that he had chosen the name for the song before he knew the sex of his expected baby: &quot;I just went, &#x27;Angie, Angie.&#x27; It was not about any particular person; it was a name, like &#x27;ohhh, Diana.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know Angela was going to be called Angela when I wrote &#x27;Angie&#x27;. In those days you didn&#x27;t know what sex the thing was going to be until it popped out. In fact, Anita named her Dandelion. She was only given the added name Angela because she was born in a Catholic hospital where they insisted that a &#x27;proper&#x27; name be added.&quot; According to &quot;NME&quot;, the lyrics written by Jagger were inspired by Jagger&#x27;s breakup with Marianne Faithfull.

This was the last Rolling Stones album produced by Jimmy Miller, who had worked with the band since 1968&#x27;s &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;. Miller had developed a debilitating drug habit during the course of his years spent with the Stones.

Bill Wyman plays bass on only three tracks on the album, with a majority of the bass duties being handled by Richards and Taylor instead. Aside from the official band members, other musicians appearing on &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; include keyboard players Billy Preston, Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart.

Recording was completed in January 1973 in Los Angeles and May 1973 at London&#x27;s Island Studios. The song &quot;Silver Train&quot; was a leftover from 1970s recordings at Olympic Sound, but was re-recorded in Los Angeles at Village Recorders. &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first album without any cover songs since &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; in 1967.

The sessions for &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; were abundant with outtakes. Two of these – &quot;Tops&quot; and &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; – would surface on &quot;Tattoo You&quot; in 1981, and feature Mick Taylor on guitar; &quot;Through the Lonely Nights&quot; became the B-side to the &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot; single and was released on CD for the first time on the 2005 compilation &quot;Rarities 1971–2003&quot;. It is a soft rock ballad that features Richards on wah wah/Leslie speaker filtered guitar with Taylor playing a brief solo. In addition, &quot;Short and Curlies&quot; was started at the &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; sessions and ended up appearing on the &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot; LP.

==Release==
At the time of release, Jagger said, &quot;I really feel close to this album, and I really put all I had into it ... I guess it comes across that I&#x27;m more into songs. It wasn&#x27;t as vague as [&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;] which kind of went on so long that I didn&#x27;t like some of the things. There&#x27;s more thought to this one. It was recorded all over the place over about two or three months. The tracks are much more varied than the last one. I didn&#x27;t want it to be just a bunch of rock songs.&quot;

The lead single, &quot;Angie&quot;, was released on 20 August 1973 by Rolling Stones Records, with &quot;Silver Train&quot; as the B-side. It reached number one in the United States and became a worldwide hit. &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; was subsequently released on 31 August, with the catalogue number COC 59101, and also shot to the top of charts worldwide. The band attracted controversy with &quot;Star Star&quot;, which was banned by the BBC in September due to its obscene lyrics. The song was originally titled &quot;Starfucker&quot; until Atlantic Records owner Ahmet Ertegün (Atlantic was the distributor of Rolling Stones Records) insisted on the change.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; autumn 1973 European Tour followed shortly after the album&#x27;s release, in which four slots in the set list were given to the new material: &quot;Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)&quot;, &quot;Star Star&quot;, &quot;Dancing with Mr D&quot; and &quot;Angie&quot;. In addition, there were a few earlier performances of &quot;Silver Train&quot; and &quot;100 Years Ago&quot;. &quot;Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)&quot; was also played on the 1975 U.S. tour. &quot;Star Star&quot; was featured regularly on the 1975, 1976 and 1978 tours, and &quot;Angie&quot; was played in 1975 and occasionally in 1976.

===Album art===
The album cover was designed by Ray Lawrence and photographed by David Bailey, a friend of Jagger&#x27;s who had worked with the Rolling Stones since 1964. The portrait of Jagger on the front cover was approximately life size in the original 12-inch LP format. Jagger was reluctant to be shot enveloped by a pink chiffon veil, which Bailey said was meant to look like &quot;Katharine Hepburn in &quot;The African Queen&quot;&quot;. The album&#x27;s gatefold has Taylor, Wyman and Watts wrapped in a similar fabric, and Richards on the back. The album&#x27;s original rejected cover art featured the entire band as centaurs and an image of goat&#x27;s head soup, a Jamaican dish made from a goat&#x27;s body parts, such as the head, feet and testicles.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
Critical reaction to the album was varied at the time. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Bud Scoppa called it &quot;one of the year&#x27;s richest musical experiences&quot;. On the other hand, Nick Kent of the &quot;NME&quot; found the record lacking in originality, stating, &quot;on &quot;Goat&#x27;s Head Soup&quot; the Stones have really nothing to say, but somehow say it so well that the results transcend the redundancy of the project in the first place&quot;. He called the album &quot;truly great&quot;, giving praise to &quot;Dancing with Mr. D&quot; especially, and recommended that listeners &quot;listen to it carefully&quot;.
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Lynn Van Matre agreed, finding the record uninnovative compared to prior works. Although she found it &quot;more carefully put together&quot; than &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, she felt &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; came across as a collection of songs rather than a cohesive project. Nevertheless, Van Matre praised the music, particularly &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. Charlie Gillett of &quot;Let It Rock&quot; magazine concluded that with &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;, the Stones &quot;finally ousted their rivals&quot; as &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Rock Band&quot;, and deemed it &quot;their first LP which is unquestionably the best rockin&#x27; groove of its time&quot;.

&quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; &quot;another fine album characterised as always by a series of fine, hard rockcuts from Mick Jagger and Keith Richard and superb guitar work from Mick Taylor&quot;. The reviewer particularly praised the ballads &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Can You Hear the Music&quot; and &quot;Angie&quot;. Writing for &quot;Zoo World&quot;, Arthur Levy considered the record on par with &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, adding that the three albums &quot;are now the seeds of a new &quot;oeuvre&quot;&quot;.

By contrast, Lester Bangs derided the album in &quot;Creem&quot;, saying, &quot;There is a sadness about the Stones now, because they amount to such an enormous &#x27;So what?&#x27; The sadness comes when you measure not just one album, but the whole sense they&#x27;re putting across now against what they once meant...&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;″s Jack Lloyd admitted that the LP would sell well, but overall found the album failed to live up to the band&#x27;s previous works. Greg Shaw of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; said the record had &quot;no redeeming qualities whatsoever&quot; and found &quot;nothing good&quot; about it. A year later, when reviewing &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, Shaw considered &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; to be the band&#x27;s worst album up to that point, writing, &quot;[it&#x27;s the album] in which the rock &amp; roll was insincere and the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; material seemed forced and out of character.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===

In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes: &quot;Sliding out of perhaps the greatest winning streak in rock history, the Stones slipped into decadence and rock star excess with &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; ... This is where the Stones&#x27; image began to eclipse their accomplishments, as Mick ascended to jet-setting celebrity and Keith slowly sunk deeper into addiction, and it&#x27;s possible hearing them moving in both directions on &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;, at times in the same song.&quot; Reviewing the 2009 reissue, Michael Hann of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album a highly favourable review, stating that those who dismiss it in comparison to its predecessors are &quot;missing a treat&quot;. Hann wrote that the album foreshadowed the band&#x27;s sound of the late 1970s and 1980s, and that &quot;Angie&quot; and &quot;Coming Down Again&quot; are among the best songs in their entire catalogue. In 2015, Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; felt that despite the inclusion of good tracks such as &quot;Dancing with Mr. D&quot;, &quot;Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)&quot; and &quot;Star Star&quot;, the album represents the end of the Stones&#x27; &quot;classic era&quot;.

Reviewing the 2020 reissue, Gallucci commented that although the Stones did not &quot;bottom out&quot; until 1976&#x27;s &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; is where their decline began. Although he found that the new mix enhances the album, he stated: &quot;It&#x27;s still sludgy, it still drags at points and it still occasionally comes off as lazy coasting by a band that felt it didn&#x27;t have to try anymore now that it was on top of the world.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awards it 4 stars and writes that the original album failed to live up to its predecessor and &quot;made it appear as if the Stones had gone overnight from the coolest, possibly greatest, rock and roll band to something less than that – just another big, commercial rock act&quot;. He felt that even throughout the new mixes, the band sounds &quot;burnt out, regretful, melancholic, [and] even at times vulnerable&quot;. He concluded that with the reissue, &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; &quot;now feels historic&quot;. Jem Aswad of &quot;Variety&quot; similarly felt that the 1973 album ended their &quot;near-peerless streak&quot; that began with &quot;Beggers Banquet&quot;. Although Aswad deems &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; a &quot;good album&quot;, he felt the reissue&#x27;s outtakes were &quot;forgettable&quot; and the unreleased live album was worth it alone. Conversely, Alan Light of &quot;Esquire&quot; called &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; a bad album, saying that it ended &quot;one of the greatest runs in rock &amp; roll history&quot;. He cited the ballads as its highlights and commented: &quot;It marked the moment the band stopped simply being the Rolling Stones and started playing the part of &#x27;The Stones&#x27;.&quot; Michael Elliott of &quot;PopMatters&quot; agreed, writing that &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; ended &quot;the greatest four-album run in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. He states that the album is where &quot;their ascension&quot; began to wane and &quot;the &quot;idea&quot; of the Rolling Stones became just as important as the band itself&quot;. Elliott nevertheless praised songs such as &quot;Angie&quot; and &quot;Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)&quot;, as well as the unreleased tracks, writing that &quot;Criss Cross&quot; would &quot;easily&quot; have been a highlight of the original record.

Reflecting years later, David Cavanagh of &quot;Uncut&quot; noted that reactions to the album – and &quot;Angie&quot; as its lead single – from fans and critics were &quot;characterised by disappointment&quot;, reasoning this was especially due to the momentum the band had built from &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; (1968) to &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972). He also added that the qualms revolved around &quot;the downbeat pensiveness of an album that sometimes seems lost in a fug of regret&quot;, as well as other apparent anti-climactic features, such as its &quot;more mainstream, keyboard-heavy production&quot;, &quot;low quota of rockers&quot; and &quot;[a] not so-obviously assertive Keith.&quot;

==Reissues==
In 1994 &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition CD, which replicated in miniature many elements of the original gatefold album packaging. The first pressing of the 2009 remaster contains a censored version of &quot;Star Star&quot; that was on the original US vinyl release, but not on the 1994 Virgin CD; later pressings contain the uncensored version.

The album was reissued once more in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version, which includes the uncensored version of &quot;Star Star&quot; with a previously unreleased fadeout.

On 4 September 2020, the album was reissued by Polydor Records, with a new mix by Giles Martin. Deluxe editions of the album featured never-before-released outtakes such as &quot;Criss Cross&quot;, released as a music video on 9 July 2020, &quot;Scarlet&quot;, featuring Jimmy Page, released as a music video on 8 August 2020, and &quot;All the Rage&quot;. The album re-entered the UK albums chart at number one, 47 years after it first reached the top of the chart in September 1973.

<text>Che Kuo Eruera Ness (born 1974), better known by his stage name Che Fu, is a New Zealand singer, songwriter and producer. A founding member of the band Supergroove, as a solo artist he has gone on to sell thousands of albums both in New Zealand and internationally. Che Fu is considered a pioneer of hip hop and Pasifika music in New Zealand.

== Early life ==
Che Fu was born Che Ness in Auckland. His mother, Miriama Rauhihi Ness is of Māori descent and his father Tigilau Ness is Niuean. Fu&#x27;s parents are well-known political activists, notably as members of the Polynesian-rights group, the Polynesian Panthers, and founding members of Rastafarian movement &quot;12 Tribes of Israel&quot;. Tigilau is a musician and part of the band Unity Pacific as well as his son&#x27;s band, &quot;The Krates&quot;. The Ness family are Rastafarians.

== Career ==

=== Supergroove (1994–1996) ===
While a student at Western Springs College, Fu and a group of friends formed the Low Down Dirty Blues Band, who later became Supergroove. Supergroove released their debut album &quot;Traction&quot; in 1994. The album went triple platinum in New Zealand and won five Tuis. Before finishing their second album, &quot;Backspacer&quot;, Fu left Supergroove to pursue a solo career.

=== Solo career (1996–1997) ===
Fu was invited to record a single with well-known New Zealand DJ DLT. The song &quot;Chains&quot; protested French nuclear testing in the Pacific and was released in July 1996, within weeks of Fu leaving Supergroove. &quot;Chains&quot; was a Number One hit on the New Zealand Singles Charts and won three Tuis, namely Single of the year, Best male vocalist, and Best songwriter. This marked the beginning of Fu&#x27;s solo career and brought prominence to Hip Hop in New Zealand.

=== &quot;2b S.Pacific&quot; (1998–2000) ===

In 1998 Fu released his debut album &quot;2b S.Pacific&quot;. The album went double platinum and spawned four top-ten hits, which was unheard-of for a local hip hop artist at the time. The following year, he received the Single of the year award for &quot;Scene III&quot;. Fu subsequently formed a band named &quot;The Krates&quot; for studio work and live performances. Paul Russell, previous drummer for Supergroove, is part of The Krates line-up.

=== &quot;Navigator&quot; (2001–2003) ===

Fu released his follow-up album &quot;Navigator&quot; in 2001, debuting at number one and generating triple platinum sales. At the 2002 New Zealand Music Awards, Fu took home five tuis: Single of the year for &quot;Fade Away&quot;, Album of the year, Top male vocalist, Best R&amp;B / Hip hop album, and Best music video. That same year, Fu received the APRA Silver Scroll for his single &quot;Misty Frequencies&quot;. He went on to win Best male vocalist in 2003 for &quot;Misty Frequencies&quot;.

=== &quot;Beneath the Radar&quot; and &quot;Hi-Score: The Best of Che Fu&quot; (2005–2007) ===
Fu&#x27;s next album &quot;Beneath the Radar&quot; was released in 2005, led out by singles &quot;2D&quot; and &quot;Lightwork&quot;. However, the record was not as successful as previous works. The following year Fu released &quot;Hi-Score – The Best of Che Fu&quot;, a compilation of hit singles from his previous three albums including &quot;Fade Away&quot;, &quot;Waka&quot; and &quot;Without a Doubt&quot;, as well as four new singles.

=== Collaborations (2008) ===
Fu teamed up with the &quot;Glass Packaging Forum&quot; to promote glass recycling with youth. The Forum hosted a competition for 9- to 15-year-olds to write rap lyrics encouraging recycling. The winners recorded their lyrics with Fu in a single called &quot;Do the krusher&quot;.

Fu also collaborated with Kimbra and hip hop group Nesian Mystik on their top-ten single &quot;Mr Mista&quot;.

=== Hedlok (2010–2013) ===
Che Fu &amp; The Krates continued to tour New Zealand and Australia. As well, Fu performs alongside another hip hop legend, Samoan rapper King Kapisi as one-half of the group Hedlok.

=== Lifetime Achievement Award (2014) ===
Fu&#x27;s contribution to New Zealand music was recognised when he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2014 Pacific Music Awards.

== Personal life ==
In 2011, Fu and his father Tigilau were featured in a documentary for Māori TV in which they travelled to their homeland of Mutalau, Niue for the first time together. While in Niue, Fu married his long-time partner Angela McDonald. Fu and his wife have four sons, Loxmyn, Marley, Jeru, and Kaselle, whom they are raising in the Rastafarian faith.

Fu is also a serious sneaker collector. Fu developed his love for sneakers in 1989 when he purchased his first pair of Air Jordan IV. Along with a few of his friends, including Dj Sir-vere, they created the PacHeat Crew and regularly organises the biggest sneaker swap meet events in New Zealand. One of his favourite sneakers is Air Jordan IV Retro Black Laser which he stated in &quot;New Zealand Sneakerhead Documentary 2021.&quot;

<doc id="948577" wikidata="Q6336601" url="?curid=948577" title="KRDO-TV">
<text>KRDO-TV (channel 13) is a television station in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States, affiliated with ABC. It is owned by the News-Press &amp; Gazette Company (NPG) alongside low-power Telemundo affiliate KTLO-LD (channel 46) and radio stations KRDO (1240 AM) and KRDO-FM (105.5). The four stations share studios on South 8th Street in Colorado Springs; KRDO-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Cheyenne Mountain.

==History==
KRDO-TV first went on the air on September 21, 1953, as an NBC affiliate. At that time, KKTV (channel 11) was a primary CBS affiliate with a secondary affiliation with ABC, and KCSJ-TV (channel 5, now KOAA-TV) was the NBC affiliate for nearby Pueblo. As such, during much of the 1950s, Southern Colorado was served by two full-time NBC affiliates and a CBS affiliate that also carried ABC programming.

By 1960, the formerly separate Colorado Springs and Pueblo TV markets melded into one single market serving the Pikes Peak region and surrounding areas. At that point, each of the three commercial TV stations became &quot;exclusive&quot; network affiliates with KKTV retaining CBS, KCSJ-TV continuing with NBC and KRDO-TV becoming a full-time ABC affiliate. KRDO was one of the few ABC affiliates that did not clear &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

KRDO-TV had been locally owned by Pikes Peak Broadcasting Company since the station signed on. In April 2006, the company announced that it was selling KRDO-TV (along with KRDO-AM and KJCT in Grand Junction) to the News-Press &amp; Gazette Company. News-Press &amp; Gazette officially took over operations of KRDO-TV on June 26, 2006; in honor of Pikes Peak Broadcasting, it changed the name of its Colorado broadcast group to Pikes Peak Television (NPG would divest KJCT in November 2013).

==News operation==
KRDO-TV currently broadcasts 36 hours of local news each week (with six hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). It was the first station in the Colorado Springs–Pueblo market to start up local newscasts in the morning, starting with weekdays in early 1983 (originally running 15 minutes in length and extending the length of the morning newscast over time) and adding weekend morning newscasts about 24 years later.

KRDO-TV&#x27;s news operation was rebranded from &quot;News 13&quot; to &quot;NewsChannel 13&quot; on the same day that NPG took over the station&#x27;s operations. Under NPG, KRDO expanded its newscasts starting with 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. newscasts replacing the single early evening 5:30 p.m. newscasts. It added weekend morning newscasts (currently airing from 6 to 7 a.m. and 8 to 9 a.m. both on Saturdays and Sundays) that started in the final week of December 2006. In June 2007 it started a midday newscast that airs from noon to 1 p.m. Both were first anchored by former KKTV anchor Eric Singer who would anchor KRDO&#x27;s 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. newscasts. Singer later worked at the &quot;Gazette&quot; as a reporter and anchor on the newspaper&#x27;s new media platforms. As of 2018, Singer no longer works in media and/or any journalism field.

On July 23, 2008, KRDO-TV began broadcasting Southern Colorado&#x27;s first local newscasts in high definition (HD), beginning with &quot;NewsChannel 13 at Noon&quot;.

On October 10, 2011, KRDO-TV added an early evening newscast at 4:30 p.m. The early evening newscast was moved up and extended to 4 p.m. during September 2012.

===Former on-air staff===
*David Brody – news director
*Giselle Fernández – began her broadcasting career as the Pueblo reporter for KRDO-TV in 1983
*John Gurtler – sports anchor

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KRDO-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 24, using virtual channel 13.

<doc id="948580" wikidata="Q9691942" url="?curid=948580" title="Magnetic hysteresis">
<text>Magnetic hysteresis occurs when an external magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnet such as iron and the atomic dipoles align themselves with it. Even when the field is removed, part of the alignment will be retained: the material has become &quot;magnetized&quot;. Once magnetized, the magnet will stay magnetized indefinitely. To demagnetize it requires heat or a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is the effect that provides the element of memory in a hard disk drive.

The relationship between field strength and magnetization is not linear in such materials. If a magnet is demagnetized () and the relationship between and is plotted for increasing levels of field strength, follows the &quot;initial magnetization curve&quot;. This curve increases rapidly at first and then approaches an asymptote called magnetic saturation. If the magnetic field is now reduced monotonically, follows a different curve. At zero field strength, the magnetization is offset from the origin by an amount called the remanence. If the relationship is plotted for all strengths of applied magnetic field the result is a hysteresis loop called the &quot;main loop&quot;. The width of the middle section along the H axis is twice the coercivity of the material.

A closer look at a magnetization curve generally reveals a series of small, random jumps in magnetization called Barkhausen jumps. This effect is due to crystallographic defects such as dislocations.

Magnetic hysteresis loops are not exclusive to materials with ferromagnetic ordering. Other magnetic orderings, such as spin glass ordering, also exhibit this phenomenon.

==Physical origin==
The phenomenon of hysteresis in ferromagnetic materials is the result of two effects: rotation of magnetization and changes in size or number of magnetic domains. In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it doesn&#x27;t. In these single-domain magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, magnetic recording).

Larger magnets are divided into regions called &quot;domains&quot;. Within each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin &quot;domain walls&quot; in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the magnetic moment per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called &quot;nucleation&quot; and &quot;denucleation&quot;).

==Measurement==

Magnetic hysteresis can be characterized in various ways. In general, the magnetic material is placed in a varying applied field, as induced by an electromagnet, and the resulting magnetic flux density ( field) is measured, generally by the inductive electromotive force introduced on a pickup coil nearby the sample. This produces the characteristic curve; because the hysteresis indicates a memory effect of the magnetic material, the shape of the curve depends on the history of changes in .

Alternatively, the hysteresis can be plotted as magnetization in place of , giving an curve. These two curves are directly related since formula_1.

The measurement may be &quot;closed-circuit&quot; or &quot;open-circuit&quot;, according to how the magnetic material is placed in a magnetic circuit.

* In &quot;open-circuit&quot; measurement techniques (such as a vibrating-sample magnetometer), the sample is suspended in free space between two poles of an electromagnet. Because of this, a demagnetizing field develops and the field internal to the magnetic material is different than the applied . The normal B-H curve can be obtained after the demagnetizing effect is corrected.
* In &quot;closed-circuit&quot; measurements (such as the hysteresisgraph), the flat faces of the sample are pressed directly against the poles of the electromagnet. Since the pole faces are highly permeable, this removes the demagnetizing field, and so the internal field is equal to the applied field.

With hard magnetic materials (such as sintered neodymium magnets), the detailed microscopic process of magnetization reversal depends on whether the magnet is in an open-circuit or closed-circuit configuration, since the magnetic medium around the magnet influences the interactions between domains in a way that cannot be fully captured by a simple demagnetization factor.

==Models==
The most known empirical models in hysteresis are Preisach and Jiles-Atherton models. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry.

However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. A more recent model, with a more consistent thermodynamic foundation, is the vectorial incremental nonconservative consistent hysteresis (VINCH) model of Lavet et al. (2011). is inspired by the kinematic hardening laws and by the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. In particular, in addition to provide an accurate modeling, the stored magnetic energy and the dissipated energy are known at all times. The obtained incremental formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all internal variables follow from the minimization of a thermodynamic potential. That allows easily obtaining a vectorial model while Preisach and Jiles-Atherton are fundamentally scalar models.

The Stoner–Wohlfarth model is a physical model explaining hysteresis in terms of anisotropic response (&quot;easy&quot; / &quot;hard&quot; axes of each crystalline grain).

Micromagnetics simulations attempt to capture and explain in detail the space and time aspects of interacting magnetic domains, often based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.

Toy models such as the Ising model can help explain qualitative and thermodynamic aspects of hysteresis (such as the Curie point phase transition to paramagnetic behaviour), though they are not used to describe real magnets.

==Applications==
There are a great variety in applications of the theory of hysteresis in magnetic materials. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example magnetic tape, hard disks, and credit cards. In these applications, &quot;hard&quot; magnets (high coercivity) like iron are desirable so the memory is not easily erased.

&quot;Soft&quot; magnets (low coercivity) are used as cores in transformers and electromagnets. The response of the magnetic moment to a magnetic field boosts the response of the coil wrapped around it. Low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis.

Magnetic hysteresis material (soft nickel-iron rods) has been used in damping the angular motion of satellites in low Earth orbit since the dawn of the space age.

<doc id="948587" wikidata="Q384052" url="?curid=948587" title="Operation Buster–Jangle">
<text>Operation Buster–Jangle was a series of seven (six atmospheric, one cratering) nuclear weapons tests conducted by the United States in late 1951 at the Nevada Test Site. &quot;Buster–Jangle&quot; was the first joint test program between the DOD (Operation &quot;Buster&quot;) and Los Alamos National Laboratories (Operation &quot;Jangle&quot;). As part of Operation &quot;Buster&quot;, 6,500 troops were involved in the Operation Desert Rock I, II, and III exercises in conjunction with the tests. The last two tests, Operation &quot;Jangle&quot;, evaluated the cratering effects of low-yield nuclear devices. This series preceded &quot;Operation Tumbler–Snapper&quot; and followed &quot;Operation Greenhouse&quot;.

== US ground forces involvement ==
Four U.S. Army units took part in the Operation Buster–Jangle &quot;Dog&quot; test for combat maneuvers after the detonation of a nuclear weapon took place. These units consisted of:
# 1st Battalion 188th Airborne Infantry Regiment 11th Airborne Division
# 3rd Medical Platoon 188th Airborne Medical Company
# Platoon Company A 127th Engineer Battalion
# Battery C 546th Field Artillery Battalion
Personnel were instructed to create foxholes and construct gun emplacements and bunkers in a defensive position 11 km south of the detonation area. After the nuclear bomb was detonated, the troops were ordered to move forward towards the affected area. While traveling closer to ground zero, troops witnessed the nuclear weapon&#x27;s effects on the fortifications that were placed in the location in preparation for the tests. The ground troops got as close as 900 meters from ground zero before they were instructed to move out of the area. The Human Resources Research Office was tasked with gathering data on the psychological experiences of the troops after witnessing such a detonation and moving closer towards the affected area.

=== Radiation protection standards ===
For the Operation Buster–Jangle series of tests, the Atomic Energy Commission created a set of criteria that must be followed if exposing armed forces, or civilians to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.
* Orientation and proper radiological training
* Dispersion of dosimeters amongst personnel
* Utilization of radiological protective equipment and clothing
* Active monitoring of radiological levels
* Briefing of personnel taking part in the exercise
* Decontamination of radioactive debris
A majority of the personnel that took part in the exercise received around 3 R, with pilots receiving an average of 3.9 R. These estimates vary given the differing data provided by the Department of Defense over the years.

<doc id="948590" wikidata="Q5135020" url="?curid=948590" title="Cloning (programming)">
<text>In computer science, cloning refers to the making of an exact copy of an object, frequently under the paradigm of instance-based programming, or object-oriented programming (OOP).

==Shallow copies==
In most programming languages (exceptions include Ruby), primitive types such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, etc. simply store their values somewhere in the computer&#x27;s memory (often the call stack). By using simple assignment, you can copy the contents of the variable to another one:

Copying primitive types in Java or C++:

int original = 42;
int copy = 0;

copy = original;
Many OOP programming languages (including Java, D, ECMAScript, and C#) make use of object references. Object references, which are similar to pointers in other languages, allow for objects to be passed around by address so that the whole object need not be copied.

A Java example, when &quot;copying&quot; an object using simple assignment:

Object original = new Object();
Object copy = null;

copy = original; // does not copy object but only its reference
The object is not duplicated, the variables &#x27;original&#x27; and &#x27;copy&#x27; are actually referring to the same object. In C++, the equivalent code
Object* original = new Object();
Object* copy = NULL;
copy = original;
makes it clear that it is a &quot;pointer&quot; to the object being copied, not the object itself. 
==Cloning==
The process of actually making another exact replica of the object instead of just its reference is called cloning. In most languages, the language or libraries can facilitate some sort of cloning. In Java, the codice_5 class contains the codice_6 method, which copies the object and returns a reference to that copied object. Since it is in the codice_5 class, all classes defined in Java will have a clone method available to the programmer (although to function correctly it needs to be overridden at each level it is used). 

Cloning an object in Java:

Object originalObj = new Object();
Object copyObj = null;

copyObj = originalObj.clone(); // duplicates the object and assigns the new reference to &#x27;copyObj&#x27;

C++ objects in general behave like primitive types, so to copy a C++ object one could use the &#x27;codice_8&#x27; (assignment) operator. There is a default assignment operator provided for all classes, but its effect may be altered through the use of operator overloading. There are dangers when using this technique (see slicing). A method of avoiding slicing can be implementing a similar solution to the Java codice_6 method for the classes and using pointers. (There is no built-in codice_6 method.)

A C++ example of object cloning:

Object originalObj;
Object copyObj(originalObj); // creates a copy of originalObj named copyObj
A C++ example of object cloning using pointers (to avoid slicing see):

Object* originalObj = new Object;
Object* copyObj = nullptr;

copyObj = new Object(*originalObj); // creates a copy of originalObj and assigns its address to copyObj

<doc id="948597" wikidata="Q2735451" url="?curid=948597" title="Eddie Aikau">
<text>Edward Ryan Makuahanai Aikau (May 4, 1946 – March 17, 1978) was a Hawaiian lifeguard and surfer. As the first lifeguard at Waimea Bay on the island of Oahu, he saved over 500 people and became famous for surfing the big Hawaiian surf, winning several awards including the 1977 Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championship. The Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational (&quot;The Eddie&quot;) is named in his honor. He was also a crew member on the Polynesian voyaging canoe &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot;.

==Life==
Born in Kahului, Maui, Aikau was the second child of Solomon and Henrietta Aikau. The words &quot;Makua Hanai&quot; in Eddie Aikau&#x27;s full name means &quot;feeding parent&quot;, an adoptive, nurturing, fostering parent, in the Hawaiian language. He was a descendant of Hewahewa, the &quot;kahuna nui&quot; (high priest) of King Kamehameha I and his successor Kamehameha II. Aikau first learned how to surf on the shorebreak of Kahului Harbor. He moved to Oahu with his family in 1959, and at the age of 16 left school and started working at the Dole pineapple cannery; the paycheck allowed Aikau to buy his first surfboard. In 1968, he became the first lifeguard hired by the City &amp; County of Honolulu to work on the North Shore. The City &amp; County of Honolulu gave Aikau the task of covering all of the beaches between Sunset and Haleiwa. Not one life was lost while he served as lifeguard of Waimea Bay, as he braved waves that often reached high or more, and saved the lives of more than 500 swimmers. In 1971, Aikau was named Lifeguard of the Year. In 1977 Aikau won the Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championship.

On February 28, 1978, TV producer John Orland was the last person Aikau rescued at Waimea Bay.

==Lost at sea==
In 1978, the Polynesian Voyaging Society was seeking volunteers for a 30-day, journey to re-enact the ancient route of the Polynesian migration between the Hawaiian and Tahitian island chains. Aikau joined the voyage as a crew member. The double-hulled voyaging canoe &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot; left the Hawaiian islands on March 16, 1978. It developed a leak in one of its hulls and later capsized about twelve miles (19 km) south of the island of Molokaʻi. In an attempt to get help, Aikau paddled toward Lānaʻi on his surfboard. Although the rest of the crew were later rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter &quot;Cape Corwin&quot;, Aikau&#x27;s body was never found. He removed his life jacket since it was hindering his paddling of the surfboard. The ensuing search for Aikau was the largest air–sea search in Hawaiian history.

==Memorial surfing invitational==
In Aikau&#x27;s honor, the surfwear company Quiksilver sponsored “The Eddie” until 2016. The event was cancelled for 2017, but the Aikau family brought it back with largely local sponsors for 2018–19 as the Quiksilver Big Wave Invitational in Memory of Eddie Aikau at Waimea Bay.

Since its inception in 1985, the tournament has only been held 11 times due to a precondition that open-ocean swells reach a minimum of , which translates to a wave face height of over . The first Eddie was held at Sunset Beach in 1985; in 1987, Eddie Aikau&#x27;s younger brother Clyde Aikau won the Eddie after it moved to Waimea Bay); the most recent tournament was in December 2024, when waves in the bay reached the minimum of 20 to high. The contest invites only 28 big-wave riders to participate in two rounds of competition. The event does not allow the use of jet skis to tow surfers into the waves.

==Popular culture==
In the 1980s, bumper stickers and T-shirts with the phrase &quot;Eddie Would Go&quot; spread around the Hawaiian Islands and to the rest of the world. According to maritime historian Mac Simpson, &quot;Aikau was a legend on the North Shore, pulling people out of waves that no one else would dare to. That&#x27;s where the saying came from – Eddie would go, when no one else would or could. Only Eddie dared.&quot;
The phrase originated during the first Eddie contest. The waves were huge and the conditions were extremely dangerous. While the contest organizers were discussing whether to put it on, Mark Foo looked at the conditions and said &quot;Eddie would go.&quot; The phrase stuck.

Another variation of the aforementioned popular phrase is &quot;Eddie wouldn&#x27;t tow.&quot; This phrase is in reference to the method of big wave surfing in which one surfer must accelerate another surfer (the former on a jet ski, the latter towed on a surfboard) to the speed of a large, fast wave. It is also partially in response to the controversy over the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; of tow-in surfing; many surfers feel that being towed in to a wave, as opposed to paddling, is against the spirit of the sport.

Other variations of the phrase include &quot;Eddie would throw&quot; (in support of the University of Hawaii&#x27;s passing attack by Colt Brennan and Timmy Chang under head coach June Jones), &quot;Eddie wouldn&#x27;t crow&quot; (in opposition to boastful and egotistical surfers), and &quot;Eddie would hoe&quot; (in support of Native Hawaiian agricultural outreach programs). Another variation used recently during the 2008 election campaign for Skyline was the slogan, &quot;Eddie would ride.&quot;

Kailua-Kona, Hawaii musician Lopaka Rootz released a reggae single honoring Eddie Aikau called &quot;Eddie.&quot; It debuted on Kapa Radio in December 2019. Rootzʻ music is played on Hawaiian radio station KWXX FM.

Austin, Texas, band Full Service recorded a song about Eddie Aikau called &quot;In A Rescue,&quot; found on their 2006 album &quot;Recess.&quot; They performed the song at the Full Service Circus in May 2013.

Sam George, an ex-professional surfer, directed a &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary about Aikau called &quot;Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau&quot;. Produced by filmmaker Agi Orsi, the documentary premiered on ESPN on October 1, 2013. The documentary produced for television details Aikau&#x27;s life from childhood to his death and won an Emmy for Best Sports Documentary Series, making it one of the few surf-related films to ever receive such recognition.

Eddie&#x27;s story was humorously (and respectfully) told by comedian Kurt Braunohler in a second-season episode of &quot;Drunk History&quot; that was dedicated to Hawaiian history, which aired on August 12, 2014.

Eddie&#x27;s story was told by Karen Kilgariff on episode 160 of the podcast &quot;My Favorite Murder&quot;, which aired February 14, 2019.

The character of Z in the animated movie &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; is loosely based on Eddie&#x27;s life and mysterious death.

On May 4, 2019, what would have been his 73rd birthday, he was honored with a Google Doodle.

In 2022, Aikau was featured in Naomi Hirahara&#x27;s anthology &quot;We Are Here: 30 Inspiring Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Who Have Shaped the United States&quot; that was published by the Smithsonian Institution and Running Press Kids.

<text>KCNC-TV (channel 4), branded CBS Colorado, is a television station in Denver, Colorado, United States, serving as the market&#x27;s CBS outlet. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s CBS News and Stations division, and maintains studios on Lincoln Street (between East 10th and 11th Avenues) in downtown Denver; its transmitter is based on Lookout Mountain, near Golden.

==History==
===NBC affiliate (1953–1995)===
The station first signed on the air at 6:30 p.m. on December 24, 1953, as KOA-TV. KOA-TV brought NBC programming to the area which prior to the station&#x27;s launch, was temporarily discontinued. The station aired an inaugural program followed by the Christmas feature &quot;The Lamb and the Manger&quot;. Founded by Metropolitan TV Company (partly owned by famed comedian Bob Hope, and not to be confused with a similarly named company later known as Metromedia), owners of KOA radio (850 AM and 103.5 FM, now KRFX), channel 4 immediately assumed the NBC affiliation from KBTV (channel 9, now KUSA), due to KOA radio&#x27;s longtime affiliation with and ownership by the NBC Red Network.

In 1965, KOA-TV began carrying most of NBC&#x27;s American Football League game telecasts as the network obtained the league&#x27;s broadcast television rights (with play-by-play announcing duties handled by Curt Gowdy); however, Denver Broncos home games aired by the network had to be blacked out due to the team&#x27;s inability to sell out tickets to the games (NFL blackout rules in effect at the time required teams to sell all tickets for home games in order to allow them to be broadcast in the team&#x27;s primary market; the league later lowered the designated sales threshold to allow home game broadcasts to 75% of all tickets, and as of 2015, the blackout rules have been lifted indefinitely), this partnership continues to this day with CBS (with exception of a hiatus from the second week of the 1995 season to end of the 1997 season, when most games moved to KUSA in that interim period). In 1967, KOA-TV ran an award-winning documentary &quot;The Acid Test, LSD&quot;; hosted by news editor Bob Palmer, the film took five months to produce with more than 5,000 feet of film shot. Photographers involved included Bill Baker, Medill Barnes, Allan Bisset, Jerry Curran, Sam Houston and Barry Trader.
In 1968, Metropolitan TV Company sold KOA-AM-TV to General Electric for $10 million. General Electric sold the KOA and KOAQ radio stations to A. H. Belo Corporation in 1983 for $22 million, as part of the company&#x27;s overall exit from broadcasting. GE retained channel 4, but was required by FCC regulations at the time—which forbade TV and radio stations in the same city, but with different owners from sharing the same call letters—to change the station&#x27;s call letters to KCNC-TV (standing for &quot;Colorado&#x27;s News Channel&quot;), which it officially adopted on August 12 of that year.

In 1986, General Electric acquired NBC, resulting in GE&#x27;s return to broadcasting and KCNC becoming the first owned-and-operated station of a major network in the state of Colorado. In 1987, control of the station has been transferred from GE itself to NBC, becoming a proper O&amp;O. By 1990, KCNC-TV devoted nearly all of its programming hours outside of network shows to locally produced news programs, broadcasting nearly 40 hours of newscasts each week. General manager Roger Ogden felt his station&#x27;s money was better spent on local programming, rather than paying syndication distributors to acquire nationally syndicated shows. In 1990, KCNC paid $11,000 to the market&#x27;s PBS member station KRMA-TV (channel 6) to carry the station&#x27;s election coverage (using KCNC&#x27;s reporters), in order to allow channel 4 to air NBC&#x27;s Tuesday night lineup, including &quot;Matlock&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

By early 1995, KCNC-TV was airing 41 hours of news a week, and the station programmed either local-interest programming or newscasts at times when NBC did not have network programming, because the station did not buy syndicated programming. This ended almost as soon as Group W/CBS took over after the affiliation switch.

===CBS switch and ownership (1995–present)===

On July 14, 1994, CBS and Westinghouse Electric Corporation agreed to a long-term affiliation deal that would result in three of Westinghouse&#x27;s television stations (longtime ABC affiliate WJZ-TV in Baltimore and longtime NBC stations KYW-TV in Philadelphia and WBZ-TV in Boston) become CBS affiliates, joining the company&#x27;s two longtime CBS affiliates (KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh and KPIX in San Francisco). The deal initially called for CBS to sell its owned-and-operated Philadelphia station WCAU; however, CBS later discovered that if it sold WCAU in order to affiliate with KYW-TV, it would have had to pay hefty capital gains taxes on the profit of the transaction. To alleviate this problem, in November 1994, NBC decided to swap ownership of KCNC-TV and KUTV in Salt Lake City (which NBC had acquired the month before), along with the VHF channel 4 allocation and transmitter in Miami to CBS in exchange for WCAU and the VHF channel 6 allocation and transmitter in Miami, which for legal purposes made the deal an even trade.

KCNC-TV became Denver&#x27;s CBS affiliate at 12:07 a.m. on September 10, 1995, after a rerun of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ended, as part of a three-way affiliation swap involving each of the market&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; network affiliates. Longtime CBS affiliate KMGH-TV (channel 7) switched its affiliation to ABC through a multi-station affiliation agreement with KMGH&#x27;s owners at the time, McGraw-Hill; while longtime ABC affiliate KUSA took the NBC affiliation through a multi-station affiliation agreement with the Gannett Company, which itself was spurred by the initial affiliation deal that was reached between New World Communications and Fox. (Gannett had already owned several NBC affiliates at the time, as is the case in the present day with successor company Tegna Inc.) Under the terms of the CBS/Westinghouse deal, CBS a sold controlling ownership interest (55%) in KCNC to Westinghouse&#x27;s broadcasting division Group W. The previous month on August 1, Westinghouse had acquired CBS for $5.4 billion; once the merger was finalized on November 24, 1995, KCNC-TV became a CBS-owned-and-operated station, making it one of a handful of television stations that have been owned by two different networks at separate points in its history. , KCNC, along with CW outlet KWGN-TV (through its owner Nexstar Media Group) are the only television stations in the Denver market that are owned-and-operated stations of one of the five major English language broadcast networks (concurrent to the CBS-Westinghouse merger, Fox had acquired KDVR (channel 31), which it would eventually sell to Local TV in 2008; it is now owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside KWGN-TV).

The station was featured in the 2007 film &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;; along with other Denver area stations, it has also been mentioned on the Colorado-set Comedy Central series &quot;South Park&quot;. In one episode, Ron Zappolo is referenced as still being with channel 4 (although at the time, Zappolo served as evening anchor at KDVR).

KCNC became the last of the &quot;big 3&quot; stations in Denver to start a digital subchannel, launching Decades on January 23, 2015. On July 24, 2018, CBS and Weigel Broadcasting announced the creation of the Start TV subchannel which launched on September 3, 2018.

In March 2023, the station rebranded as &quot;CBS Colorado&quot;, as part of a rebranding of all of the CBS owned-and-operated stations. At that time the newscasts were rebranded as &quot;CBS News Colorado&quot;, which was already the name of KCNC-TV&#x27;s streaming news service.

==Programming==
As an owned-and-operated station, KCNC-TV clears the entire CBS network schedule; however, it is one of the few CBS stations that airs the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot; (the Saturday and Sunday editions of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;) a half-hour earlier than most affiliates due to its hour-long 5 p.m. newscast (aligning it with the program&#x27;s recommended timeslot in the Central Time Zone) and &quot;CBS Saturday Morning&quot; (the Saturday edition of &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;) two hours earlier than most CBS stations (aligning it with the program&#x27;s recommended timeslot in the Eastern Time Zone).

===Sports programming===
In 1998, CBS acquired the broadcast rights to the American Football Conference of the National Football League (which absorbed the AFL and the Broncos in 1970), moving the conference&#x27;s game telecasts to the network from NBC (and with it, from KUSA, which aired most games between the second week of the 1995 season to the end of the 1997 regular season [and Super Bowl XXXII in January 1998, which the Broncos won]); as a result, KCNC regained the local television rights to the Broncos (coinciding with the season in which the team won its second straight Super Bowl championship and fan favorite John Elway played his final season with the Broncos before his retirement from the NFL). Ironically, KCNC would later carry the Broncos&#x27; win in Super Bowl 50, the last game of quarterback Peyton Manning before he retired.

As an NBC affiliate, KCNC aired any Denver Nuggets basketball contests through the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; beginning in 1990 until the station&#x27;s 1995 disaffiliation with the network.

===News operation===
KCNC-TV presently broadcasts 39 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes on Mondays through Thursdays; 6 hours, 5 minutes on Fridays; and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces the public affairs program &quot;Together with Karen Leigh&quot; (which airs every Friday at 6:30 p.m., with a rebroadcast on Sunday mornings at 7:30 a.m.) and sports highlight/discussion programs &quot;Saturday Sports Extra&quot; (which airs during the final 13 minutes of the Saturday 10 p.m. newscast) and &quot;AutoNation All Access&quot; (which airs after the Sunday 10 p.m. newscast).

In 1969, Bob Palmer, who served as anchor of the 10 p.m. newscast, left channel 4 for KLZ-TV (now KMGH-TV), to replace John Rayburn, who left for an anchor job at a station in Kansas City. In the 1970s, the station ran its late evening newscasts on weekends at 11 p.m. (one hour later than the typical late news timeslot in the Mountain Time Zone). In 1981, KBTV news director Roger Ogden was hired by KOA-TV as its general manager; during his tenure, Ogden hired Marv Rockford and John Haralson, who had both worked alongside Ogden at channel 9, to join the station&#x27;s news staff. Ogden named George Caldwell, Sam Allred and Ron Zappolo as its main anchor team. Janet Zappala and Alan Berg joined the station as well that year. In 1983, Marv Rockford was promoted to the news director position; while Peter Rogot was named the station&#x27;s weekend anchor and Marty Aarons joined Bob Palmer and Janet Zappala as anchors; other staffers that joined channel 4 during 1983 included Wendy Bergen, Karen Layton, Marcia Neville, Tom Raponi and Mike Silva.

In 1982, KMGH-TV anchor Bill Stuart left to join KOA-TV, joining several other new hires such as Linda Farrell, Sylvia Cordy, Jeff Hullinger, Steve Anderson, Stephanie White, Merrie Lynn, Tom Martino and Tom Baer. That June, KOA-TV debuted a half-hour 4:30 p.m. newscast titled &quot;First News&quot;, which was co-anchored by Larry Green and Linda Farrell, with Suzanne McCarroll as the featured reporter on the new show; the program would eventually expand to an hour-long broadcast beginning at 4 p.m., and remained on the station until it was canceled on May 26, 2006, in order to air &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in the timeslot. Also that year, the station&#x27;s news helicopter (&quot;Copter 4&quot;) crashed into a snowy stand of pine trees near Larkspur, while en route to the crash site of a commuter airplane, killing KOA-TV pilot/reporter Karen Key (who was the first female pilot of a news helicopter in the country) and mechanic Larry Zane; autopsy results later reported that Key had a blood alcohol content at the time of the crash at 0.09 (just below the legal limit of 0.10).

On the evening of June 18, 1984, Alan Berg—an attorney who hosted programs on both KOA radio and KOA-TV and was known for taking a largely liberal stand on issues, using an abrasive and combative demeanor to callers and guests with opposing views at times—was shot and killed in the driveway of his home by members of a White Nationalist group called The Order. The incident was adapted into Steven Dietz&#x27;s 1988 play &quot;God&#x27;s Country&quot; and the 1988 film &quot;Betrayed&quot;, as well as the film &quot;Brotherhood of Murder&quot; (1999). Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1988 film of Eric Bogosian&#x27;s play &quot;Talk Radio&quot; drew inspiration from Berg&#x27;s plight.

In 2002, Marv Rockford was forced out as general manager of KCNC and replaced by Walt DeHaven. Meanwhile, Tony Lopez moved from San Antonio to join channel 4. In 2003, Molly Hughes and Bill Stuart served as KCNC&#x27;s primary evening news team for its 10 p.m. newscast, with Brian Maass and Rick Sallinger as reporters. On April 21, 2008, Karen Leigh (who previously worked at Minneapolis sister station WCCO-TV) replaced Molly Hughes as co-anchor of the weeknight newscasts. KCNC also began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition on that date, becoming the second television station in the Denver market (after KUSA) to make the conversion and the market&#x27;s third station to broadcast all of its programming, including syndicated programs, in the format (behind KUSA and its sister station KTVD (channel 20)).

The 4 p.m. newscast returned to the schedule on June 13, 2011, only lasting less than three months before it was dropped a second time after the September 2, 2011, broadcast and replaced three days later by &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;. On February 3, 2013, KCNC debuted a &quot;Mobile Weather Lab&quot;, a technologically equipped Chevrolet Suburban (which is retrofitted for off-road use and is primarily used during the weekday morning newscasts; and the equipped-based model was manufactured by General Motors-owned Chevrolet) that is used for storm tracking and is equipped with a weather station that provides live data. On January 13, 2014, KCNC expanded its weekday morning newscast to 2½ hours, with the addition of a half-hour at 4:30 a.m.

KCNC-TV launched a streaming news service, CBSN Denver (now CBS News Colorado) on February 19, 2020, as part of a rollout of similar services (each a localized version of the national CBSN service) across the CBS-owned stations.

KCNC re-added an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast on weekdays on September 12, 2022.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KCNC-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 35, using virtual channel 4.

As part of the SAFER Act, KCNC kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

<doc id="948608" wikidata="Q1195571" url="?curid=948608" title="The Man in the Moon (1991 film)">
<text>The Man in the Moon is a 1991 American coming of age drama film. It was the final film directed by Robert Mulligan before his death in 2008, from a screenplay written by Jenny Wingfield. It stars Reese Witherspoon in her film debut, Sam Waterston, Tess Harper, Emily Warfield, and Jason London.

The film’s story, set in rural 1950s Louisiana, centers around Dani (Witherspoon), a 14-year-old tomboy who experiences first love and heartbreak when older boy Court (London) moves next door. The film received critical acclaim, making Roger Ebert’s list of the Top 10 Films of 1991.

==Plot==
In the summer of 1957, Danielle &quot;Dani&quot; Trant is a 14-year-old girl in Louisiana who is close to her older sister, the college-bound Maureen. Dani is expected to help take care of younger sister Missy as their mother Abigail is pregnant, but she prefers to run off to the neighbor&#x27;s creek to go skinny dipping. One day, she finds the creek occupied by her new neighbor, 17-year-old Court Foster. Court kicks Dani out and she takes an immediate dislike to him.

Later that day, Abigail tells Dani an old childhood friend is coming over for dinner with her children. Abigail&#x27;s old friend turns out to be Marie Foster, a widow who has moved back to the area with her three sons, revealed to be Court and his younger brothers. When Dani is forced to accompany Court into town for groceries, the two start to get along and Dani soon develops a crush on him.

Meanwhile, Maureen breaks up with her boyfriend Billy Sanders after he tries to pressure her into having sex after a dance. Dani asks Maureen for advice on how to kiss a boy, and Maureen demonstrates by practicing on her hand. Dani and Court continue to go swimming during the hot summer days and become good friends. The two agree to meet up during the evening as Court has too much farm work to do during the day. That night, Dani and Court goof around in the water and nearly reach a point where they are about to kiss, but Court pushes Dani away and says she is a little girl who doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s doing.

Dani runs home just as a thunderstorm breaks out. Abigail runs outside looking for Dani, but accidentally trips on a root in the process and suffers an injury. Dani&#x27;s father Matthew races her to the hospital, where she is kept in order to treat a concussion and toxemia caused by her fall. When he returns home from the hospital, he punishes Dani, whipping her with his belt.

The next day, Court brings food to the Trant house and apologizes to Dani for the other night, saying he would still like to be friends. The next time they go swimming the two share Dani&#x27;s first kiss. Once Dani has made up with her father, he suggests that she invite Court over so he can get to know him better. When Court comes over for dinner, he finally meets Maureen. Dani can tell it is love at first sight for the two of them. While Dani visits her mother in the hospital, Court shows up at the Trant house where Maureen is babysitting Missy. Aware of her sister&#x27;s feelings for Court, Maureen is initially reluctant to return his affections but ultimately gives in when he kisses her.

Over the next few days, Dani is alienated by Court. She goes to stay by her mother&#x27;s side at the hospital as she goes into labor. Maureen has entered into a romance with Court, and the two consummate their love in a field. When Dani returns home with Abigail and the new baby, she witnesses Maureen sneaking back home and realizes she was with Court. Angry at her sister’s betrayal, she runs towards Court’s farm. A busy Court has been plowing the fields but gets distracted by daydreams of Maureen. He reaches out to grab a tree branch and falls off the tractor, landing under the blades of the disc harrow. Dani is seen running through the woods when she stumbles upon Court badly injured in the field being cradled by his inconsolable mother. She races back home to tell her father, who drives off in the direction of the incident breaking through the fence.

When Matthew returns home, he is visibly distraught, wearing some of Court&#x27;s blood on his clothes, the family realizes that Court has died from his injury. Maureen hides her pain at first, while Dani bursts into tears. After Court&#x27;s funeral, Dani continues to be angry at Maureen for stealing Court away from her. Matthew tells Dani that although she has a right to be hurt, being mad won&#x27;t bring Court back, and Maureen will be her sister for life. Dani comforts Maureen as she weeps on Court&#x27;s fresh grave, and the film ends with Maureen and Dani talking on the porch at night as the summer draws to a close, looking up at the moon and becoming close again.

==Production==
&quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; marked the film debut of then-14-year-old Reese Witherspoon. Director Mulligan commented that casting her in the role of Dani was:
 The cinematography was by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Freddie Francis. As Witherspoon was clearly a minor at the time of filming, her parents were on set during filming of the skinny dipping scene.

The waterhole and swimming scenes were filmed on location at Kisatchie Bayou and Kisatchie Falls in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. This area is part of Kisatchie National Forest.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the performances of Waterston, Harper, and Strickland. Maslin also wrote, &quot;Mr. Mulligan also gets an outstandingly natural performance out of Miss Witherspoon, who has no trouble carrying a lot of the film single-handedly. It falls to her to remind the audience that this story is at heart about a family, and she does.&quot;

The film was highly praised by Roger Ebert, who awarded the film four stars in his review and included it at No. 8 in his Top 10 list of the best films of 1991, declaring:

===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; grossed $2.8million at the box office, against a budget of $6.6million.

== Versions ==
Later, Mulligan became disenchanted with how the film was edited and cut by airlines, particularly American and Delta Air Lines, for in-flight showings. He became so disturbed by these airline edits to the picture that he insisted that his name be removed from the credits of the film on the airline version.

<text>Rocky Mountain PBS is a network of PBS member television stations serving the U.S. state of Colorado. Headquartered in Denver, it is operated by Rocky Mountain Public Media, Inc., a non-profit organization which holds the licenses for most of the PBS member stations licensed in the state, with the exception of KBDI-TV (channel 12) in Broomfield, which serves as the Denver market&#x27;s secondary (or &quot;beta&quot;) PBS station through the network&#x27;s Program Differentiation Plan. The network comprises five full-power stations—flagship station KRMA-TV (channel 6) in Denver and satellites [[KTSC (TV)|KTSC]] (channel 8) in Pueblo (also serving Colorado Springs), KRMJ (channel 18) in Grand Junction, KRMU (channel 20) in Durango and [[KRMZ]] (channel 24) in Steamboat Springs. The broadcast signals of the five full-power stations and 60 translators cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska and New Mexico.

The network&#x27;s offices and network operations center are located at the Buell Public Media Center on Arapahoe Street in Denver&#x27;s Five Points section. KRMJ and KTSC maintain their own respective studio facilities: KRMJ is based at Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, while KTSC operates from the campus of Colorado State University–Pueblo. Rocky Mountain Public Media also operates a public radio station, NPR and jazz outlet KUVO (89.3 FM) in Denver, which joined the organization in a merger announced in January 2013.

==History==
The network&#x27;s flagship station, KRMA-TV (channel 6) in Denver, first signed on the air on January 30, 1956, as an educational television station owned by the Denver Public Schools, with University of Denver instructor Jim Case serving as its program director. It is the oldest public television station in the Rocky Mountains. Its original studio facility was located in a converted body shop at the Emily Griffith Opportunity School in downtown Denver. The station was originally a member of National Educational Television (NET), before becoming a member of PBS when it launched on October 6, 1970.

Originally broadcasting only two hours of programming a day during the week, KRMA soon became a key PBS member, distributing PBS programming to many areas in the Rocky Mountain region that did not have educational stations of their own. From the 1960s onward, it began building translators across Colorado and surrounding states. It was also carried by nearly every cable television system in Colorado and eastern Wyoming. Denver Public Schools sold KRMA to the community group Channel Six, Inc. in 1987. In 1992, KRMA moved its operations into a studio facility on Bannock Street in Denver&#x27;s Civic Center neighborhood, which formerly housed the operations of ABC affiliate KUSA-TV (channel 9, now an NBC affiliate); that station moved to a new facility located on Speer Boulevard before KRMA moved into the Bannock Street facility.

In response to requests from viewers on the Western Slope, KRMA applied for and was awarded a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate a station on UHF channel 18 in Grand Junction in August 1995. That station signed on the air on January 1, 1997, as KRMJ. Prior to that station&#x27;s launch, KRMA had been available on cable in western Colorado for decades. It still operates a number of translators in the area. Soon afterward, KRMA dropped its longtime &quot;Six&quot; branding and relaunched as &quot;Rocky Mountain PBS&quot;, while Channel Six, Inc. changed its name to the Rocky Mountain Public Broadcasting Network.

In 1999, KTSC (channel 8) in Pueblo joined the network after it was sold by the University of Southern Colorado (now CSU-Pueblo). The station had originally operated as a separate PBS station for Pueblo, Colorado Springs and southern Colorado from its sign-on on February 3, 1971. Until KRMJ&#x27;s sign-on, KRMA and KTSC had been the only full PBS members in Colorado (as mentioned above, Denver&#x27;s KBDI is a &quot;beta&quot; PBS member).

On December 3, 2004, KRMU (channel 20) in Durango signed on to serve southwestern Colorado and a small portion of northwestern New Mexico. When KRMU received its license in 2001, it was the first television station in the United States to operate a digital signal without a companion analog channel assignment.

On February 2, 2007, Rocky Mountain PBS added its fifth full-service station and its second station in western Colorado, KMAS-TV (channel 24) in Steamboat Springs. KMAS had served as the Telemundo station for the Denver market prior to joining RMPBS, and brought its programming into Denver itself by way of two low-powered repeater stations—KMAS-LP (channel 33) and KSBS-LP (channel 10). However, its status was placed in doubt when NBC Universal purchased KDEN-TV (channel 25) and converted it into a Telemundo owned-and-operated station. NBC Universal finally decided to donate the KMAS-TV license and transmitter to Rocky Mountain PBS. On September 4, 2007, the station&#x27;s call letters were changed to KRMZ, reflecting its identity as a Rocky Mountain PBS station.

On January 16, 2013, it was announced that the non-profit investigative journalism organization I-News Network and public radio station KUVO (89.3 FM) had reached an agreement to merge with Rocky Mountain PBS. The merger is intended to broaden the reach of their content to new platforms and ensure formal collaboration between the outlets. The deal was expected to close in April 2013. With the merger, the corporate name was modified to Rocky Mountain Public Media.

In 2020, RMPBS moved out of the Bannock Street facility and into the new Buell Studios building which also house radio stations KUVO and Urban Alternative formatted &quot;The Drop&quot;.

==Programming==
Rocky Mountain PBS produces several local programs, such as the weekly &quot;Colorado State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Arts District&quot; and the seasonal &quot;Colorado Experience&quot;. However, the network has focused much of its production efforts on local documentaries, which often take months or years to produce. Many of these documentaries (such as &quot;La Raza de Colorado&quot;, &quot;Jewel of the Rockies&quot;, &quot;The Arkansas River: From Leadville to Lamar&quot; and &quot;Urban Rez&quot; have earned multiple Emmy Awards over the years.

Satellite stations KRMJ and KTSC occasionally break away from the KRMA feed to provide programming targeted for their respective communities, and each station airs separate local promotions and underwriting. KRMU is a full-time satellite of KRMJ, while KRMZ is a full-time satellite of KRMA. Citing costs at each station, Rocky Mountain PBS applied for and received waivers of the FCC&#x27;s main studio rule, which requires that each full-service station maintain a main studio within its local service area.

==Stations==

Notes:
*1. KTSC joined RMPBS in 1999 and also covers Colorado Springs. &quot;SC&quot; could stand for either Southern Colorado or State College. Southern Colorado State College was CSU-Pueblo&#x27;s name at the time the station signed on.
*2. KRMZ used the callsigns KSBS-TV from 1988 to 2000, and KMAS-TV from 2000 to 2007.
*3. KRMZ (then KMAS-TV) joined RMPBS in 2007.

===Subchannels===
The signals of Rocky Mountain PBS&#x27; stations are multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
During 2009, in the lead-up to the analog-to-digital television transition that would ultimately occur on June 12, Rocky Mountain PBS shut down the analog transmitters of its stations on a staggered basis. Listed below are the dates each analog transmitter ceased operations as well as their post-transition channel allocations:
* KRMA-TV ended programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 18, using virtual channel 6. As part of the SAFER Act, KRMA kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.
* KTSC shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 26 to VHF channel 8 for post-transition operations.
* KRMJ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 18, on June 12, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 17 to channel 18 for post-transition operations.
* KRMZ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 24, on February 17, 2009, the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 10, using virtual channel 24.

KRMU signed on in December 2004 as a digital-only station, although it also had endured a temporary shutdown in early 2009 in final preparation for the transition.

===Translators===
In addition to its five full-service television stations, Rocky Mountain PBS operates one of the largest translator networks in the country, serving portions of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, Nebraska and Utah. KRMA feeds two translators in Boulder and Fort Collins. KTSC feeds 10 translators in rural southern Colorado, and KRMJ feeds 13 translators serving rural western Colorado. The other translators are operated by community groups that pick up one of the three Rocky Mountain PBS regional feeds, and carry the signals onward through their systems.

All 25 translators within the RMPBS system operate as digital signals, and as such carry the primary channel and two subchannels from their respective parent transmitters.

<text>In mathematics, the 11-cell is a self-dual abstract regular 4-polytope (four-dimensional polytope). Its 11 cells are hemi-icosahedral. It has 11 vertices, 55 edges and 55 faces. It has Schläfli type {3,5,3}, with 3 hemi-icosahedra (Schläfli type {3,5}) around each edge.

It has symmetry order 660, computed as the product of the number of cells (11) and the symmetry of each cell (60). The symmetry structure is the abstract group projective special linear group of the 2-dimensional vector space over the finite field with 11 elements L2(11).

It was discovered in 1977 by Branko Grünbaum, who constructed it by pasting hemi-icosahedra together, three at each edge, until the shape closed up. It was independently discovered by H. S. M. Coxeter in 1984, who studied its structure and symmetry in greater depth.

== Related polytopes==
The abstract 11-cell contains the same number of vertices and edges as the 10-dimensional 10-simplex, and contains 1/3 of its 165 faces. Thus it can be drawn as a regular figure in 10-space, although then its hemi-icosahedral cells are skew; that is, each cell is not contained within a flat 3-dimensional subspace.

<text>Jingmei () is a neighborhood in Taipei City. Formerly an administrative district, in 1990 it merged with Muzha District, becoming the western part of the newly created Wenshan District.

Jingmei is located south of downtown Taipei with adjacency with Xindian, New Taipei City. Jingmei is known for its locally famous night market. The market includes hundreds, if not thousands, of small street vendors, selling items, including traditional Chinese and Taiwanese snacks, cheap clothes, and various other items. The Jingmei area also includes many stores, upscale restaurants, movie theaters, and karaoke establishments, making it a popular destination for nights and weekends for the local population. Jingmei Night Market is accessible by subway via Jingmei Station, which is serviced by the Songshan–Xindian line or Green line of the Taipei Metro. Jingmei also serves as a small transportation hub for local buses, since many bus routes run through the area.

Jingmei has a centrally located small park, adjacent to Jingxing Junior High-School.

Several scenic walks and panoramic views of Jingmei and of downtown Taipei are available around HsianChien Temple. HsianChien is situated on a small hill and accessible by an easy path from Jingshin Street. The shortest route up and down takes about 20 minutes each way.

==History ==
The former name Kingbe (), refers to the large spouts of the Liugongjun irrigation system. The name was later modified ().

During Japanese rule, the area was under the jurisdiction of , Bunsan District, Taihoku Prefecture. After World War II, the area remained part of Shenkeng Township. In 1950, the more elegant name &quot;Jingmei&quot; () was adopted and stood on its own as an urban township. However, in Taiwanese the old name &quot;Kéng-bé&quot; is still used.

In 1967, the township was merged into Taipei City as Jingmei District. In 1990, it merged with Muzha District to create Wenshan District.

<text>KMGH-TV (channel 7) is a television station in Denver, Colorado, United States, affiliated with ABC. It is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company alongside Sterling-licensed independent station KCDO-TV, channel 3 (and its Denver-based translator KSBS-CD, channel 10). The two stations share studios on Delgany Street in Denver&#x27;s River North Art District; KMGH-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Lookout Mountain, near Golden.

KMGH-TV operates digital translator KZFC-LD (channel 26) in Windsor, and its main channel is relayed on a digital subchannel of KSBS-CD, allowing homes with issues receiving KMGH&#x27;s VHF signal or only a UHF antenna to receive KMGH-TV in some form; KCDO-TV also carries a 7.1 subchannel to extend KMGH-TV&#x27;s over-the-air reach throughout northeast Colorado and western Nebraska. The station&#x27;s second and third subchannels, which carry Scripps-owned diginets Ion Mystery and Laff, are relayed on translators KZCO-LD (channel 30) in Denver and KZCS-LD (channel 18) in Colorado Springs.

==History==
===As a CBS affiliate===
Channel 7 first signed on the air on November 1, 1953, as KLZ-TV. It was founded by the Oklahoma City-based Oklahoma Publishing Company (operated by Edward K. Gaylord), which also owned KLZ radio (560 AM and 106.7 FM, now KWBL).

KLZ-TV immediately took the CBS affiliation from KBTV (channel 9, now KUSA), owing to KLZ radio&#x27;s longtime affiliation with the CBS Radio Network. 

In 1954, Gaylord sold the KLZ television and radio stations to Time Inc., who later subordinated their acquisition under its in 1961 established subsidiary Time-Life, Inc. as Time–Life Broadcasting, Inc. 

The station&#x27;s original studio facilities were housed in a renovated former auto dealership on the east side of the block at East 6th Avenue and Sherman Street. Channel 7 moved to an eight-sided, five-story building called &quot;The Communications Center&quot;, on the intersection of Speer Boulevard and Lincoln Street in 1969.
Time-Life sold the station on channel 7 to McGraw-Hill in late October 1970, in a group deal that also involved the company&#x27;s other radio and television combinations in Indianapolis, San Diego, and Grand Rapids; and KERO-TV (channel 23) in Bakersfield, California. In order to comply with the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s new restrictions on concentration of media ownership that went into effect shortly afterward, McGraw-Hill was required to sell the KLZ radio stations as well as their sister radio properties in Indianapolis, San Diego, and Grand Rapids to other companies. Time-Life would later purchase WOTV (channel 8, now WOOD-TV) in Grand Rapids in the final deal. By the time the sale was finalized in June 1972, the purchase price for the entire group was just over $57 million. WFBM-TV (channel 6, now WRTV) in Indianapolis, KERO-TV in Bakersfield, and KOGO-TV (channel 10, now KGTV) in San Diego were retained by McGraw-Hill, along with KLZ-TV, which subsequently changed its call letters to KMGH-TV on the 1st (with the calls reflecting the new ownership), in order to comply with a now-repealed FCC rule in place then that forbade TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership from sharing the same callsigns. 

The 1990s did not begin well for KMGH; the station saw significant overall financial losses in 1990 and 1991, as well as a decrease in viewership for its local newscasts. A new management team introduced in 1991 turned things around at KMGH; net profit soared 105.5% in 1992 as a result.

===ABC affiliation===
Although KMGH had been one of CBS&#x27; stronger affiliates, the station would end up disaffiliating from the network due to a series of events that were set in motion as a result of CBS&#x27; partnership with the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in July 1994 (and the network&#x27;s eventual merger with that company in August 1995). As part of the deal, the network moved its programming from its owned-and-operated station in Philadelphia, WCAU-TV (channel 10), to Westinghouse&#x27;s KYW-TV (channel 3). In a complex ownership deal that was announced in November 1994, CBS traded WCAU to NBC in exchange for two of that network&#x27;s O&amp;Os (then longtime affiliates)—Denver&#x27;s KCNC-TV (channel 4) (which had been an O&amp;O since the station&#x27;s then-owner General Electric purchased NBC in 1986) and Salt Lake City&#x27;s KUTV (channel 2) (which the network had acquired less than one month earlier). CBS then formed a joint venture with Westinghouse that assumed ownership of KYW-TV, KCNC and KUTV, with Westinghouse serving as majority owner. Group W/CBS and NBC also swapped the transmitter facilities—and by association, channel frequencies—of their respective stations in Miami, WCIX (now WFOR-TV) and WTVJ.
At the same time, McGraw-Hill had struck an affiliation agreement with ABC, due partly to the fact that its stations in San Diego and Indianapolis had already been aligned with the network (Bakersfield sister station KERO-TV was also involved in the deal between McGraw-Hill and ABC; however, that station had to wait for its affiliation contract with CBS to expire in March 1996, before it could finally switch to ABC). In keeping with all of this, each of the three major broadcast networks relocated their programming to different stations in the Denver market on September 10, 1995; ABC moved its programming to KMGH from KUSA, with KMGH&#x27;s outgoing CBS affiliation going to KCNC and NBC moving from KCNC to KUSA. The final CBS program to air on KMGH-TV was a repeat of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, which began at 9 p.m. the previous day.

On June 14, 2011, McGraw-Hill announced that it would exit from the broadcasting industry and put its entire television station group up for sale; on October 3 of that year, the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the eight-station broadcasting division to the E. W. Scripps Company. The FCC approved the sale on November 29, 2011, and the deal was officially completed on December 30, 2011, resulting in McGraw-Hill&#x27;s exit from broadcasting after 39 years. The deal marked a re-entry into the Denver market for Scripps; prior to its acquisition of KMGH, the company had owned the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; from 1926 until the afternoon newspaper ceased publishing in 2009. On May 7, 2019, KMGH dropped Azteca América and replaced it with the Escape network (now Ion Mystery), which moved over from KTFD-TV.

In July 2024, KMGH left its longtime home at The Communications Center on Speer Boulevard for a state-of-the-art facility located near Coors Field.

==Programming==
KMGH-TV clears the entire ABC network schedule; however, it is one of the few ABC stations that air the Saturday and Sunday editions of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; a half-hour to one hour earlier than most affiliates due to its hour-long 5 p.m. newscast, and also airs the weekend editions of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot; one hour earlier (aligning those programs with their recommended airtimes of both programs in the Central Time Zone).

During the 1950s, channel 7&#x27;s staff included newscaster (later sports anchor and &quot;Dialing for Dollars&quot; host) Starr Yelland, who came to the station from KOA-TV (channel 4, now KCNC-TV); weatherman Warren Chandler, and Ed Scott, who hosted a children&#x27;s program on the station as &quot;Sheriff Scotty&quot;. In 1956, KLZ-TV presented the first remote television broadcast from a courtroom after general manager Hugh Terry won a court battle to allow cameras into the courtroom.

In 1957, the station&#x27;s weekly public affairs series &quot;Panorama&quot; Seven (which was written and hosted by Gene Amole), became the first locally produced program in the Denver market to earn a Peabody Award (channel 7 has since won three more Peabody Awards for the investigative report &quot;Honor and Betrayal: Scandal at the Air Force Academy&quot; in 2003, reported by John Ferrugia and produced by Kurt Silver and current news director Jeff Harris, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Failing the Children: Deadly Mistakes&quot;, reported by Ferrugia and produced by Tom Burke and Arthur Kane, and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Investigating the Fire&quot;) Starting in 1968 and running through 1983, KLZ-TV aired one of the most popular children&#x27;s programs in the Denver market, the &quot;Noell and Andy Show&quot;, which aired weekdays at 8 a.m. The program&#x27;s coloring contest drew hundreds of entries each week.

In 2012, KMGH acquired the broadcast rights to Denver Broncos head coach John Fox&#x27;s weekly analysis show, &quot;The John Fox Show&quot;; the station aired the program until the team&#x27;s 2013 season, losing the rights to KDVR (which renamed the program as &quot;Fox on Fox&quot;) on August 7, 2014.

The station has also been the recording location for sportswriter Woody Paige&#x27;s appearances on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Around the Horn&quot; since his 2016 departure from &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, and the station is credited as such in Paige&#x27;s chroma key background.

Unlike many ABC affiliates which preempted the network&#x27;s presentation of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, KMGH, along with the other McGraw-Hill stations, aired the film in 2004. KMGH currently airs any Denver Nuggets basketball games selected for broadcast through the &quot;NBA on ABC&quot;, which included the team&#x27;s first NBA championship win in their inaugural NBA Finals appearance in 2023.

The station also broadcasts select Colorado Avalanche hockey games through the &quot;NHL on ABC&quot; and on KJCT News 8 beginning in 2021; this included the team&#x27;s victory in the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals (The network&#x27;s previous contract, which ran from 1999 to 2004, also included the Avalanche&#x27;s 2001 Stanley Cup Finals victory).

As a CBS affiliate, the station aired the Denver Broncos&#x27; appearances on KMGH-TV, in Super Bowls XII, XXI and XXIV.

===News operation===
KMGH-TV presently broadcasts 35 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours on weekdays, hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays). Unlike most stations affiliated with ABC or its competitors, KMGH did not broadcast a local newscast in the 6 p.m. timeslot on weeknights for eight years, opting to fill the hour with episodes of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (the station&#x27;s previous 6 p.m. news program was canceled after the May 26, 2006, broadcast). In addition, the station produces the sports highlight program &quot;Sports Xtra&quot;, which airs Saturdays during the final 15 minutes of the 10 p.m. newscast. As mentioned above, the 6 p.m. newscast was restored on September 8, 2014, due to the move of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; to KDVR; it features an &#x27;express&#x27; format with more stories and weather coverage.

While KLZ-TV always had a strong line-up of local and syndicated programs during the station&#x27;s early years, it was obviously helped by CBS&#x27;s longtime dominance nationally. The station was the first in Denver to operate a news bureau in Washington, D.C., as well as the first Denver station to receive reports from its own radio and television correspondents in Europe and Asia. Channel 7 televised the first kidney transplant in the mid-1960s. It led the 10 p.m. news ratings from the early 1960s until 1977, when it was displaced from the #1 slot by KBTV, which benefited from ABC&#x27;s ratings increases in prime time as well as an improved news product that took advantage of live electronic news gathering technology. KMGH-TV was actually the first television station in the market to use ENG equipment in 1975, with its &quot;Insta Cam&quot;, which was never promoted on-air. In 1970, Channel 7&#x27;s newscasts had a 40% ratings share. KOA-TV and KBTV battled for second place, each pulling in about a 24 share for their newscasts. By the end of the decade, KBTV had a 54% ratings share at 10 p.m., more than all of the other stations combined.

The 10 p.m. news team during the 1960s was helmed by news anchor Carl Akers, weatherman Warren Chandler and sports anchor Starr Yelland. All three did live commercials during the program. John Rayburn joined the station as co-anchor of the 10 p.m. newscast in 1964, before departing for KBTV in 1967. In 1966, Akers took a short-lived retirement only to return to Denver television a year later at KBTV as that station&#x27;s anchor and news director; he was replaced at channel 7 by KOA-TV anchor Bob Palmer. The team of Palmer, Chandler and Yelland continued until 1975, when Terry Phillips was added as a news co-anchor; Phillips was replaced by John Lindsey in 1976. Palmer returned to KOA-TV in 1982. From December 1994 to August 1997, the station operated a weather radar system known as &quot;Doppler Max7&quot;, that was heavily promoted during the failed tabloid-formatted &quot;Real Life, Real News&quot; era; this period (from 1996 to 1997) emphasized hard news and investigative reports, but was unable to beat KUSA and KCNC, the former of which had overtaken KMGH for first and the latter for second in most timeslots in the ratings by this point.

On July 15, 2002, KMGH-TV became the first major market television station in the world to broadcast fully automated newscasts. A computer system, known as ParkerVision, combines the work of several technical personnel in a program requiring just a single operator. Ten studio cameras, channels of audio, all art graphics and electronic titling along with tape operations are programmed and played back live by one person instead of seven people. KMGH-TV is the only Denver television station to have won two Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Awards: the first for the 2003 report, &quot;Honor and Betrayal: Scandal at the Air Force Academy&quot; and the second for the 2010 investigative documentary &quot;33 Minutes to 34 Right&quot;.

On August 18, 2008, KMGH became the second television station in the Denver market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. In 2011, KMGH was named &quot;Station of the Year&quot; by the Associated Press Television-Radio Association. On May 26, 2011, KMGH moved its hour-long 4 p.m. newscast Seven &quot;News Now&quot; to 3 p.m. and reduced the program to a half-hour (&quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; moved into the newscast&#x27;s former timeslot); the program ended after the September 7, 2012, broadcast, in order to accommodate the syndicated talk show &quot;Katie&quot;.

On June 28, 2013, KMGH entered into a partnership with &quot;The Denver Post&quot; to collaborate on investigative reports and weather coverage as well as providing additional Spanish-language news content.

On July 14, 2014, KMGH-TV launched a 4 p.m newscast, &quot;The Now&quot;, which features a mixture of local and national news segments.

====Sponsored content controversy====
In 2021, the station&#x27;s local lifestyle show was tricked into promoting a fake sexual wellness product, &quot;invented&quot; by a team working for late-night political commentary show &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot;, called the &quot;Venus Veil&quot;, which was actually just a blanket; the show&#x27;s team paid KMGH $2,800 to feature the fake product and an interview with its &quot;creator&quot; as a way to illustrate how stations such as KMGH promote sponsored content. The segment aired on the station&#x27;s lifestyle program, which is not a newscast, and was disclosed as paid for by the &#x27;client&#x27;.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KMGH-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on April 16, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 17 to VHF channel 7. Sister station KZCO-LD signed on a digital signal on KMGH&#x27;s pre-transition channel position in 2013 to serve as a fill-in translator of KMGH-TV, which has experienced issues with signal reception in portions of the Denver market as VHF channel 7 is prone to signal interference.

===Translators===
The following translators rebroadcast KMGH-TV&#x27;s signal to further extend its coverage area:
* Anton: K29NF-D
* Denver: KSBS-CD
* Haxtun: K36PT-D
* Idalia: K26FP-D
* Julesburg: K36PS-D
* Peetz: K20FS-D
* Pleasant Valley: K20GK-D
* Sterling: KCDO-DT
* Wray: K19ML-D
* Yuma: K35OL-D

KMGH&#x27;s main channel is further relayed by sister station KCDO-TV and its own translator network into northeastern Colorado and western Nebraska.

The following translators relay KMGH-TV&#x27;s DT2 and DT3 subchannels only:
* Colorado Springs: KZCS-LD
* Denver: KZCO-LD

<text>Irene Ryan (born Irene Noblitt, Noblett, or Noblette; October 17, 1902 – April 26, 1973) was an American actress and comedian who found success in vaudeville, radio, film, television, and Broadway. She is most widely known for her portrayal of Daisy May &quot;Granny&quot; Moses, mother-in-law of Buddy Ebsen&#x27;s character Jed Clampett on the long-running TV series &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971). She was nominated for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1963 and 1964 for the role.

==Early years==
Ryan was born Irene Noblitt, Noblett or Noblette on October 17, 1902, in El Paso, Texas, the second child and daughter of Catherine J. &quot;Katie&quot; (née McSharry) and James Merritt Noblitt. Her father was an army sergeant from North Carolina and her mother had emigrated from Ireland. Irene was 17 years younger than her sister Anna.

==Career==
Ryan began her performing career at age 11, when she won $3 (equal to $ today) for singing &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; in an amateur contest at the Valencia Theater in San Francisco.

At 20, she married writer-comedian Tim Ryan. They performed in vaudeville as a double act, known in show business as a &quot;Dumb Dora&quot; routine, and epitomized by George Burns and Gracie Allen. Known professionally as &quot;Tim and Irene&quot; (and billed formally as Tim Ryan and Irene Noblette), they starred in 11 short comedies for Educational Pictures between 1935 and 1937. The films were usually vehicles for their vaudevillian dialogue, with Irene as the flighty young woman who drives Tim to distraction. Tim&#x27;s frequent admonition, &quot;Will you stop?&quot;, became a catchphrase and then the title of one of their shorts. Substituting for Jack Benny in 1936, they starred in &quot;The Jell-O Summer Show&quot; on NBC&#x27;s Red Network.

The Ryans had no children and divorced in 1942, although Irene kept the surname. She toured with Bob Hope, and was on his radio program for two years. She played Edgar Kennedy&#x27;s wife in two of his RKO short films in 1943. That same year, she appeared in the country music film &quot;O, My Darling Clementine&quot;.

By 1943, Tim Ryan had become a prolific character actor in movies; Monogram Pictures reunited Tim and Irene for four feature films, the last being the 1944 musical feature &quot;Hot Rhythm&quot; with Dona Drake.

In 1946, Irene married Harold E. Knox, who worked in film production (they divorced in 1961, having had no children). She continued to work in motion pictures into the late 1940s and early 1950s, generally playing fussy or nervous women. In 1946, she joined the cast of &quot;The Jack Carson Show&quot; on CBS Radio, playing &quot;a neighborhood storekeeper who operates a combination candy shop and lending library.&quot; In January 1955, she made her first television sitcom appearance in an episode of the CBS series &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;. She appeared with Walter Brennan in the 1959 episode &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s New Job&quot; on the ABC sitcom &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;. In the 1960-1961 CBS sitcom &quot;Bringing Up Buddy&quot;, starring Frank Aletter, she was cast in three episodes as Cynthia Boyle, and she appeared as Rusty Wallace in &quot;The Romance of Silver Pines&quot;, a 1962 episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, starring Fred MacMurray. She guest-starred as Ellie McCabe in &quot;The Old Stowe Road,&quot; a 1962 episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;Ichabod and Me&quot;. In 1966, Ryan was a contestant/celebrity guest star on the game show &quot;Password&quot;.

===&quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;===
Ryan was cast in what was her best-known role in 1962 as Daisy &quot;Granny&quot; Moses, mother-in-law of patriarch Jed Clampett, in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (although Ryan was only five and a half years older than Ebsen). The character was named in honor of the artist Anna Mary Robertson &quot;Grandma&quot; Moses, who had died aged 101 the previous year, and only started her professional career as a painter in her later years.

According to Filmways publicist Ted Switzer, series creator and producer Paul Henning had decided to cast Bea Benaderet as Granny, but when Ryan read for the role &quot;with her hair tied back in a bun and feisty as all get-out,&quot; everyone was taken with her performance. Executive producer Al Simon and Henning immediately said, &quot;That&#x27;s Granny!&quot; Later, when Benaderet saw Ryan&#x27;s audition, she agreed. Benaderet was cast as Jed Clampett&#x27;s cousin, Pearl Bodine.

In 1966, Irene Ryan played Granny in the comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, We&#x27;ll Think of a Title&quot;, co-starring Rose Marie and Morey Amsterdam.

==Stage==
In 1972, Ryan starred as Berthe in the Bob Fosse–directed Broadway musical &quot;Pippin&quot;, in which she sang the number &quot;No Time at All.&quot; A live recording (sound with still photographs) was made.

==Club==
In 1965, Ryan signed a two-year contract to perform at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Recognition==
In both 1963 and 1964, Ryan was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Series (Lead).

Ryan was nominated for Broadway&#x27;s 1973 Tony Award as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Musical) for her performance in &quot;Pippin&quot;. She lost to Patricia Elliott (&quot;A Little Night Music&quot;) in a ceremony held about a month before Ryan&#x27;s death.

==Death ==
On March 10, 1973, Ryan suffered an apparent stroke during a performance of &quot;Pippin&quot;, flew home to California on her doctor&#x27;s orders, and was hospitalized. She was diagnosed with an inoperable glioblastoma (malignant brain tumor). Ryan died at St. John&#x27;s Hospital, Santa Monica, California, on April 26, 1973, aged 70. The causes of death were given as glioblastoma and arteriosclerotic heart disease. Her body was interred in a mausoleum at the Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica beside her sister, Anna Thompson. * note: Irene Ryan is buried in a plot at Woodlawn, not a mausoleum.

==Legacy and charitable causes==
The Irene Ryan Acting Scholarship awards scholarships to outstanding actors who participate in the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. The scholarship provides &quot;recognition, honor, and financial assistance to outstanding student performers wishing to pursue further education.&quot; These scholarships have been awarded by the Irene Ryan Foundation since 1972.

<doc id="948621" wikidata="Q423386" url="?curid=948621" title="Carfentanil">
<text>Carfentanil or carfentanyl, sold under the brand name Wildnil, is an extremely potent opioid analgesic used in veterinary medicine to anesthetize large animals such as elephants and rhinoceroses. It is an analogue of fentanyl which is a structural derivative. It is typically administered in this context by tranquilizer dart. Carfentanil has also been used in humans to image opioid receptors. It has additionally been used as a recreational drug, typically by injection, insufflation, or inhalation. Deaths have been reported in association with carfentanil.

Effects and side effects of carfentanil in humans are similar to those of other opioids and include euphoria, relaxation, pain relief, pupil constriction, drowsiness, sedation, slowed heart rate, low blood pressure, lowered body temperature, loss of consciousness, and suppression of breathing. The effects of carfentanil, including overdose, can be reversed by the opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone, though higher doses than usual may be necessary compared to other opioids. Carfentanil is a structural analogue of the synthetic opioid analgesic fentanyl. It acts as an ultrapotent and highly selective agonist of the μ-opioid receptor.

Carfentanil was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of chemists at Janssen Pharmaceuticals which included Paul Janssen. It was introduced into veterinary medicine in 1986. Carfentanil is legally controlled in most jurisdictions.

==Uses==

===Veterinary use===
Chosen for its high therapeutic index, carfentanil was first sold in 1986 under the brand name &quot;Wildnil&quot; for use in combination with an α2-receptor agonist as a tranquilizing agent for large mammals like hippos, rhinos, and elephants. Commercial production of Wildnil ceased in 2003; the drug is now available only in compounded form. Since then, etorphine has become the standard tranquilizing agent for large mammals, with diprenorphine as the preferred reversal agent. Diprenorphine was also used previously to reverse the effects of carfentanil.

===Clinical use===
Carfentanil has been used at doses of less than 7 μg as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography imaging of the μ-opioid receptor in the brain in humans.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Carfentanil acts as a highly selective agonist of the μ-opioid receptor. It showed affinity values (&quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;) of 0.051 nM for the μ-opioid receptor, 4.7 nM for the δ-opioid receptor, and 13 nM for the κ-opioid receptor in rat brain. Thus, carfentanil displayed 90- and 250-fold selectivity for the μ-opioid receptor over the δ-opioid receptor and the κ-opioid receptor, respectively. With human proteins, the affinities were 0.024 nM for the μ-opioid receptor, 3.3 nM for the δ-opioid receptor, and 43 nM for the κ-opioid receptor, demonstrating 140- and 1,800-fold selectivity for the μ-opioid receptor over the δ- and κ-opioid receptors, respectively. Carfentanil appears to have higher affinity for the μ1-opioid receptor over the μ2-opioid receptor. Carfentanil has approximately 10,000 times the analgesic potency of morphine, 4,000 times the potency of heroin, and 20 to 100 times the potency of fentanyl in animal studies. The effects of carfentanil are reversed by μ-opioid receptor antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone, though higher than normal doses of these agents may be necessary in humans due to the extremely high potency of carfentanil.

===Pharmacokinetics===
A lipophilic chemical that can easily cross the blood–brain barrier, carfentanil has a very rapid onset of action and is longer acting than fentanyl. Its elimination half-life in humans was 42 to 51 minutes following an intravenous bolus at an average dose of 1.34 μg (19 ng/kg). However, in a case study of recreational exposure, the half-lives of carfentanil and its metabolite norcarfentanil were estimated to be 5.7 hours and 11.8 hours, respectively.

==Chemistry==

Carfentanil is an analogue of fentanyl and is also known as (4methoxycarbonyl)fentanyl. Related analogues of fentanyl include 4phenylfentanyl, lofentanil (3methylcarfentanyl), N-methylnorcarfentanil, R-30490 (4methoxymethylfentanyl), sufentanil, and thiafentanil.

==History==

===Increase in illicit use===

Over three hundred cases of overdose related to fentanyl and Carfentanil analogues were reported between August and November 2016 in several of the United States, including Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky and Florida. In 2017, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin man died from a Carfentanil overdose, likely taken unknowingly with another illegal drug such as heroin or cocaine. Carfentanil is most often taken with heroin or by users who believe they are taking heroin. Carfentanil is added to or sold as heroin because it is less expensive, easier to obtain, and easier to manufacture than heroin.

===Importation from China===
Authorities in Latvia and Lithuania reported seizing Carfentanil as an illicit drug in the early 2000s.

Around 2016, the United States and Canada reported a dramatic increase in shipment of carfentanil and other strong opioid drugs to customers in North America from Chinese chemical supply firms. In June 2016, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seized one kilogram of carfentanil shipped from China in a box labeled &quot;printer accessories&quot;. According to the Canada Border Services Agency, the shipment contained 50 million potentially lethal doses of the drug, in containers labeled as toner cartridges for HP LaserJet printers.

Carfentanil was not a controlled substance in China until 1 March 2017, and until then was manufactured legally and sold openly over the Internet, being actively marketed by several Chinese chemical companies.

===Moscow theater hostage crisis===
In 2012, a team of researchers at the British chemical and biological defence laboratories at Porton Down found carfentanil and remifentanil in clothing from two British survivors of the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and in the urine from a third survivor. The team concluded that the Russian military had used an aerosol mist of carfentanil and remifentanil to subdue Chechen hostage takers. Researchers had previously surmised from the available evidence that the Moscow emergency services had not been informed of the use of the agent, despite being instructed to bring opioid antagonists to the scene. Unaware that hundreds of patients had been exposed to high doses of strong opioids, the emergency workers failed to bring sufficient quantities of naloxone and naltrexone to counteract the effects of carfentanil and remifentanil. One hundred and twenty-five people exposed to the aerosol are confirmed to have died from respiratory failure during the incident.

===Potential as a chemical weapon===
The toxicity of carfentanil in humans and its ready commercial availability has raised concerns over its potential use as a chemical weapon of mass destruction by rogue nations and terrorist groups. The toxicity of carfentanil has been compared to that of nerve gas.

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===

==== China ====

Carfentanil has been controlled in China since 1 March 2017. The trade war between China and the United States has included controversy over the effectiveness of this control.

====Germany====
Carfentanil and its stereoisomers and salts are controlled by the Betäubungsmittelgesetz as a Anlage I substance and can only be used with the special permission of the authorities.

====United States====
Carfentanil is classified as Schedule II under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9743 and a 2016 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 19 grams (less than 0.7 oz.). Carfentanil has been manufactured under the brand-name Wildnil by Wildlife Laboratories Inc. Wildlife Laboratories Inc. is also the manufacturer of diprenorphine and etorphine for veterinary use. 

====United Kingdom ====
Carfentanil has been specifically controlled as a Class A drug since 1986.

<text>The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a species of trout native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in North America and Asia. The [[steelhead]] (sometimes called steelhead trout) is an anadromous (sea-run) form of the coastal rainbow trout or Columbia River redband trout that usually returns to freshwater to spawn after living two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been introduced into the Great Lakes and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.

Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between , while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach . Coloration varies widely based on subspecies, forms, and habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.

Wild-caught and hatchery-reared forms of the species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States, Southern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as whirling disease), or hybridizing with closely related species and subspecies. The rainbow trout is included in the list of the top 100 globally invasive species. Other introductions into waters previously devoid of fish or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created sport fisheries, such as the Great Lakes and Wyoming&#x27;s Firehole River.

Some local populations of specific subspecies, or in the case of steelhead, distinct population segments, are listed as either threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The steelhead is the official state fish of Washington.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name of the rainbow trout is . The species was originally named by German naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792 based on type specimens from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia. Walbaum&#x27;s original species name, &quot;mykiss&quot;, was derived from the local Kamchatkan name used for the fish, &quot;mykizha&quot;. The name of the genus is from the Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;ónkos&quot;) &quot;lump, bend, hook&quot; and &quot;&quot; (&quot;rhúnkhos&quot;) &quot;snout&quot;, in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the &quot;kype&quot;).

Sir John Richardson, a Scottish naturalist, named a specimen of this species in 1836 to honor Meredith Gairdner, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company surgeon at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River who provided Richardson with specimens. In 1855, William P. Gibbons, the curator of Geology and Mineralogy at the California Academy of Sciences, found a population and named it (Latin: rainbow), later corrected to . These names faded once it was determined that Walbaum&#x27;s description of type specimens was conspecific and therefore had precedence. In 1989, morphological and genetic studies indicated that trout of the Pacific Basin were genetically closer to Pacific salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; species) than to the &quot;Salmo&quot;s – brown trout or Atlantic salmon of the Atlantic Basin. Thus, in 1989, taxonomic authorities moved the rainbow, cutthroat, and other Pacific Basin trout into the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;. Walbaum&#x27;s name had precedence, so the species name became the scientific name of the rainbow trout. The previous species names &quot;irideus&quot; and &quot;gairdneri&quot; were adopted as subspecies names for the coastal rainbow and Columbia River redband trout, respectively. Anadromous forms of the coastal rainbow trout or Columbia River redband trout are commonly known as steelhead.

===Subspecies===
Subspecies of are listed below as described by fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke (2002).
==Description==
Resident freshwater rainbow trout adults average between in riverine environments, while lake-dwelling, and anadromous forms may reach . Coloration varies widely between regions and subspecies. Adult freshwater forms are generally blue-green or olive green with heavy black spotting over the length of the body. Adult fish have a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most pronounced in breeding males. The caudal fin is squarish and only mildly forked. Lake-dwelling and anadromous forms are usually more silvery in color with the reddish stripe almost completely gone. Juvenile rainbow trout display parr marks (dark vertical bars) typical of most salmonid juveniles. In some redband and golden trout forms, parr marks are typically retained into adulthood. Some coastal rainbow trout and Columbia River redband trout populations and cutbow hybrids may also display reddish or pink throat markings similar to cutthroat trout. In many regions, hatchery-bred trout can be distinguished from native trout via fin clips. Fin clipping the adipose fin is a management tool used to identify hatchery-reared fish.

==Life cycle==
Rainbow trout, including steelhead forms, generally spawn in early to late spring (January to June in the Northern Hemisphere and September to November in the Southern Hemisphere) when water temperatures reach at least . The maximum recorded lifespan for a rainbow trout is 11 years.

===Freshwater life cycle===
Freshwater resident rainbow trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake-resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support the production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly-bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.

Spawning sites are usually a bed of fine gravel in a riffle above a pool. A female trout clears a redd in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down. Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 eggs per kilogram of weight. During spawning, the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel, and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest, covering the eggs with the displaced gravel. As eggs are released by the female, a male moves alongside and deposits milt (sperm) over the eggs to fertilize them. The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat. Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or alevin. In approximately two weeks, the yolk sac is completely consumed, and fry commence feeding mainly on zooplankton. The growth rate of rainbow trout varies with area, habitat, life history, and quality and quantity of food. As fry grow, they begin to develop &quot;parr&quot; marks or dark vertical bars on their sides. In this juvenile stage, immature trout are often called &quot;parr&quot; because of the marks. These small juvenile trout are sometimes called &#x27;fingerlings&#x27; because they are approximately the size of a human finger. In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing, but no natural reproduction occurs, some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or &quot;carryover&quot; for several seasons before they are caught or perish.

===Steelhead life cycle===

The oceangoing (anadromous) form, including those returning for spawning, are known as steelhead in Canada and the U.S. In Tasmania they are commercially propagated in sea cages and are known as ocean trout, although they are the same species.

Like salmon, steelhead return to their original hatching grounds to spawn. Similar to Atlantic salmon, but unlike their Pacific &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; salmonid kin, steelhead are iteroparous (able to spawn several times, each time separated by months) and make several spawning trips between fresh and salt water, although fewer than 10 percent of native spawning adults survive from one spawning to another. The survival rate for introduced populations in the Great Lakes is as high as 70 percent. As young steelhead transition from freshwater to saltwater, a process called &quot;smoltification&quot; occurs where the trout undergoes physiological changes to allow it to survive in seawater. There are genetic differences between freshwater and steelhead populations that may account for the smoltification in steelhead.

Juvenile steelhead may remain in the river for one to three years before smolting and migrating to sea. Individual steelhead populations leave the ocean and migrate into their freshwater spawning tributaries at different times of the year. Two general forms exist—&quot;summer-run steelhead&quot; and &quot;winter-run steelhead&quot;. Summer-run fish leave the ocean between May and October before their reproductive organs are fully mature. They mature in freshwater while en route to spawning grounds where they spawn in the spring. Summer-run fish generally spawn in longer, more inland rivers such as the Columbia River. Winter-run fish are ready to spawn when they leave the ocean, typically between November and April, and spawn shortly after returning to fresh water. Winter-run fish generally spawn in shorter, coastal rivers typically found along the Olympic Peninsula and British Columbia coastline, and summer-run fish are found in some shorter, coastal streams. Once steelhead enter riverine systems and reach suitable spawning grounds, they spawn just like resident freshwater rainbow trout.

=== Growth and oxidative stress on mitochondria ===
During periods of rapid growth and aging, trout display high levels of metabolic activity. High metabolic activity has been correlated with increased levels of oxidative stress and decreased machinery repair in rainbow trout. During high oxidative stress, the mitochondria are the most important organelle contributing to tissue damage because of their role in metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species. In a study done by Almaida-Pagàn et al., researchers identified changes to the heart and brain mitochondrial membrane phospholipid composition in rainbow trout due to the differing levels of oxidative stress each organ faced during a high-stress time such as rapid growth and development. Stock rainbow trout of ages 1, 2, and 4 years had their heart and brain mitochondria isolated and analyzed for fatty acid composition. The tissues showed an overall similar percentage of total phospholipids but differed in the types and proportions of phospholipids. With age, the heart showed more unsaturated phospholipids, which are more susceptible to peroxidation, and thus, damage. The brain mitochondria of rainbow trout show decreased levels of docosahexaenoic acid and a lower peroxidation index, suggesting a lower susceptibility to damage by oxidative stress and a different reaction to growth compared to heart mitochondria. During the trout&#x27;s development into an adult, a time of intense growth, the mitochondrial membrane composition and fluidity changes, which can cause defects in the electron transport chain. These defects combined with altered machinery repair and reactive oxygen species may cause more detrimental effects on the mitochondria in the fish as it matures. 

==Feeding==
Rainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as piscivorous or aggressive as brown trout or chars. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on larval, pupal, and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic diptera). They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and crickets) that fall into the water, as well as algae. Other prey includes small fish up to one-third of their length, crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become planktonic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish, and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from the carcasses of other fish. They have even been observed to have consumed hatchling snakes, such as the barred grass snake (&quot;Natrix helvetica&quot;). Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, squid and amphipods.

==Range==

The native range of is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, east along the Aleutian Islands, throughout southwest Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska, and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico. It is claimed that the Mexican forms of represent the southernmost native range of any trout or salmon (&quot;Salmonidae&quot;), though the Formosan landlocked salmon () in Asia inhabits a similar latitude. The range of coastal rainbow trout extends north from the Pacific basin into tributaries of the Bering Sea in northwest Alaska, while forms of the Columbia River redband trout extend east into the upper Mackenzie River and Peace River watersheds in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, which eventually drain into the Beaufort Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean. Since 1875, the rainbow trout has been widely introduced into suitable lacustrine and riverine environments throughout the United States and around the world. Many of these introductions have established wild, self-sustaining populations.
==Artificial propagation==

Since 1870, rainbow trout have been artificially propagated in fish hatcheries to restock streams and introduce them into non-native waters. The first rainbow trout hatchery was established on San Leandro Creek, a tributary of San Francisco Bay, in 1870, and trout production began in 1871. The hatchery was stocked with the locally native rainbow trout, and likely steelhead of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies . The fish raised in this hatchery were shipped to hatcheries out of state for the first time in 1875, to Caledonia, New York, and then in 1876 to Northville, Michigan. In 1877, another California rainbow trout hatchery, the first federal fish hatchery in the National Fish Hatchery System, was established on Campbell Creek, a McCloud River tributary. The McCloud River hatchery indiscriminately mixed coastal rainbow trout eggs with the eggs of local McCloud River redband trout . Eggs from the McCloud hatchery were also provided to the San Leandro hatchery, thus making the origin and genetic history of hatchery-bred rainbow trout somewhat diverse and complex. In the U.S., there are hundreds of hatcheries operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and various state agencies and tribal governments propagating rainbow trout for conservation and recreational sport fishing. Six of ten Canadian provinces have rainbow trout farms, with Ontario leading production.

===Aquaculture===

Rainbow trout are commercially farmed in many countries throughout the world. The practice began in the late 19th century, and since the 1950s commercial production has grown dramatically. Worldwide, in 2007, of farmed rainbow trout were harvested with a value of about US$2.6 billion. The largest producer is Chile. In Chile and Norway, sea cage production of steelhead has expanded to supply export markets. Inland production of rainbow trout to supply domestic markets has increased in countries such as Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, and Spain. Other significant trout-producing countries include the U.S., Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Lesotho. While the U.S. rainbow trout industry as a whole is viewed as ecologically responsible, trout raised elsewhere are not necessarily farmed with the same methods.

About three-quarters of U.S. production comes from Idaho, particularly the Snake River area, due in part to the quality and temperature of the water available there. California and Washington also produce significant numbers of farmed trout. In the east, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and West Virginia have farming operations. Rainbow trout farming is one of the largest finfish aquaculture industries in the U.S. They are raised inland in facilities where raceways or ponds have continuously flowing water with little pollution and a low risk of escape. The U.S. industry is noted for using best management practices. Imports constitute only about 15 percent of farmed rainbows sold in the U.S., and nearly all domestic production is consumed within the country; very little is exported. The U.S. produces about 7 percent of the world&#x27;s farmed trout. Rainbow trout, especially those raised in farms and hatcheries, are susceptible to enteric redmouth disease. A considerable amount of research has been conducted on redmouth disease, given its serious implications for rainbow trout farming. The disease does not infect humans.

There have been recent interest and efforts in introducing a rainbow trout species that can be completely fed on a vegan diet through genetic selection. Research from a study team led by USDA research geneticist Dr. Ken Overturf concluded that such natural genetic variation of vegan trouts does exist and believe they can produce rainbow trouts that can be completely fed on a 100% plant-based diet.

==Conservation==

Populations of many rainbow trout subspecies, including anadromous forms (steelhead) of (coastal rainbow trout) and (Columbia River redband trout), have declined in their native ranges due to over-harvest, habitat loss, disease, invasive species, pollution and hybridization with other subspecies, and some introduced populations, once healthy, have declined for the same reasons. As a consequence, some rainbow populations, particularly anadromous forms within their native range, have been classified as endangered, threatened or species of special concern by federal or state agencies. Rainbow trout, and subspecies thereof, are currently a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved indicator species for acute freshwater toxicity testing.

Many non-profit organizations have formed to protect, conserve and restore native rainbow trout and steelhead populations. Generally, in partnership with various universities, state, federal and tribal agencies, and private interests, these organizations sponsor projects to restore habitat, prevent habitat loss and promote awareness of threats to native trout populations. 
Trout Unlimited (TU) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of North American freshwater streams, rivers, and associated upland habitats for trout, salmon, other aquatic species, and people. A typical TU project is the Circle Creek Fish Passage Project, in which access to a spawning stream is being improved for steelhead and other salmonid species. The Wild Salmon Center, an international coalition of Russian, Canadian and U.S. scientists, sponsors the Kamchatka Steelhead Project, a 20-year (1994–2014) scientific program to study and conserve the present condition of Kamchatkan steelhead (&quot;mikizha&quot;), a species listed in the &quot;Red Data Book of Russia&quot;. Other high-profile organizations involved in rainbow trout conservation include California Trout, which protects wild trout and other salmonids in the waters of California. The Steelhead Society of British Columbia promotes the wellbeing of wild salmonids in British Columbia. In 1997, a group of approximately 40 ichthyologists, biologists and naturalists from several U.S. and Mexican institutions formed a collaborative group—Truchas Mexicanas—to study the diversity of Mexican native trout, most of which are considered subspecies of .

===Hybridization and habitat loss===
Rainbow trout, primarily hatchery-raised fish of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies introduced into waters inhabited with cutthroat trout, will breed with cutthroats and produce fertile hybrids called cutbows. In the case of the westslope cutthroat trout (&quot;O. clarki lewisi&quot;), hybridization with introduced rainbow and Yellowstone cutthroat trout (&quot;O. clarki bouvieri&quot;) is threatening the westslope cutthroat trout with genomic extinction. Such introductions into the ranges of redband trout , &quot;newberrii&quot;, and &quot;stonei&quot;) have severely reduced the range of pure stocks of these subspecies, making them &quot;species of concern&quot; in their respective ranges.

Within the range of the Kern River golden trout of Southern California, hatchery-bred rainbows introduced into the Kern River have diluted the genetic purity of the Kern River rainbow trout and golden trout through intraspecific breeding. The Beardslee trout , a genetically unique lake-dwelling variety of the coastal rainbow trout that is isolated in Lake Crescent (Washington), is threatened by the loss of its only spawning grounds in the Lyre River to siltation and other types of habitat degradation.

===Invasive species and disease===
====Whirling disease====

 is a myxosporean parasite of salmonids (salmon, trout, and their allies) that causes whirling disease in pen farmed salmon and trout and also in wild fish populations. It was first described in rainbow trout introduced to Germany a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe, northern Asia, the U.S., South Africa and other countries. In the 1980s, was found to require &quot;Tubifex tubifex&quot; (a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life cycle. The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with polar filaments ejected from nematocyst-like capsules.

This parasite was originally a mild pathogen of brown trout in central Europe and other salmonids in northeast Asia, and the spread of the rainbow trout has greatly increased its impact. Having no innate immunity to , rainbow trout are particularly susceptible, and can release so many spores that even more resistant species in the same area, such as , can become overloaded with parasites and incur mortalities of 80 to 90 percent. Where has become well-established, it has caused a decline or even elimination of whole cohorts of fish.

The parasite was first recorded in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, but until the 1990s, whirling disease was considered a manageable problem affecting only rainbow trout in hatcheries. It eventually became established in the natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is damaging several sport fishing rivers. Some streams in the western U.S. lost 90 percent of their trout. Whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which is important for the tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, in 2005 anglers in Montana spent approximately $196,000,000 in activities directly related to trout fishing in the state. Some of the salmonids that infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and anadromous forms of rainbow trout—steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their population decline.

====New Zealand mud snail====

The New Zealand mud snail , once endemic to New Zealand, has spread widely and has become naturalised and an invasive species in many areas including Australia, Asia (Japan, in the Garmat Ali River in Iraq since 2008), Europe (since 1859 in England), and North America (U.S. and Canada: Thunder Bay in Ontario since 2001, British Columbia since July 2007), most likely inadvertently during human activity. It can reach concentrations greater than , endangering the food chain by outcompeting native snails and water insects for food, leading to sharp declines in native populations. There is evidence North American fishes are unable to digest the tiny but hard shells of the mud snail, and that their presence may result in poor growth outcomes for rainbow trout.

The mud snail was first detected in the U.S. in Idaho&#x27;s Snake River in 1987. Since then, the snail has spread to the Madison River, Firehole River, and other watercourses around Yellowstone National Park, and has been discovered throughout the western U.S. The exact means of transmission is unknown, but it is likely that it was introduced in water transferred with live game fish and has been spread by ship ballast or contaminated recreational equipment such as wading gear.

====Didymo====
, commonly known as didymo or rock snot, is a species of diatom that produces nuisance growths in freshwater rivers and streams with consistently cold water temperatures. In New Zealand, invasive didymo can form large mats on the bottom of rivers and streams in late winter. It is not considered a significant human health risk, but it can affect stream habitats and sources of food for fish, including rainbow trout, and make recreational activities unpleasant. Even though it is native in North America, it is considered a nuisance organism or invasive species.

====Redmouth disease====
Enteric redmouth disease is a bacterial infection of freshwater and marine fish caused by the pathogen . It is primarily found in rainbow trout and other cultured salmonids. The disease is characterized by subcutaneous hemorrhaging of the mouth, fins, and eyes. It is most commonly seen in fish farms with poor water quality. Redmouth disease was first discovered in Idaho rainbow trout in the 1950s.

=== Removal methods ===
Some fisheries are focused on removing rainbow trout in order to reestablish native trout populations. This can be done by poisoning rivers with chemicals such as antimycin or rotenone which have been declared safe in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency. Once the chemicals have dissipated, native trout are released into the river. Another method is to use electrofishing which enables the fish to be caught alive and harvested or re-located. This technique has been used in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to rid it of rainbow trout that were introduced in the 1930s and have thrived ever since. They are hoping to re-establish native brook trout in at least some of the river system. Neither method of control is 100% effective and are best regarded as methods to change the relative population sizes of fish species.

===Steelhead declines===
Steelhead populations in parts of its native range have declined due to a variety of human and natural causes. While populations in Alaska and along the British Columbia coast are considered healthy, populations in Kamchatka and some populations along the U.S. West Coast are in decline. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has 15 identified distinct population segments, in Washington, Oregon, and California. Eleven of these populations are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, ten as threatened and one as endangered. One distinct population segment on the Oregon coast is designated a U.S. Species of Concern.

The Southern California distinct population segment, which was listed as endangered in 2011, has been affected by habitat loss due to dams, confinement of streams in concrete channels, water pollution, groundwater pumping, urban heat island effects, and other byproducts of urbanization. Steelhead in the Kamchatka Peninsula are threatened by over-harvest, particularly from poaching and potential development, and are listed in the &quot;Red Data Book of Russia&quot; that documents rare and endangered species.

====Hatchery stocking influence====

Several studies have shown that almost all California coastal steelhead are of native origin, despite over a century of hatchery stocking. Genetic analysis shows that the South Central California Coast and Southern California populations from Malibu Creek north, including the San Gabriel River, Santa Ana River, and San Mateo Creek, are not hatchery strains. Steelhead from Topanga Creek and the Sweetwater River were partly, and those from San Juan Creek completely, of hatchery origin. Genetic analysis has also shown that the steelhead in the streams of the Santa Clara County and Monterey Bay basins are not of hatchery origin, including the Coyote Creek, Guadalupe River, Pajaro River, Permanente Creek, Stevens Creek, San Francisquito Creek, San Lorenzo River, and San Tomas Aquino Creek basins. Natural waterfalls and two major dams have isolated Russian River steelhead from freshwater rainbow trout forms above the impassable barriers; a 2007 genetic study of fin samples collected from steelhead at 20 different sites both above and below passage barriers in the watershed found that although 30 million hatchery trout were stocked in the river from 1911 to 1925, the steelhead remain of native and not hatchery origin.

Releases of conventionally reared hatchery steelhead pose ecological risks to wild steelhead populations. Hatchery steelhead are typically larger than the wild forms and can displace wild-form juveniles from optimal habitats. The dominance of hatchery steelhead for optimal microhabitats within streams may reduce wild steelhead survival as a result of reduced foraging opportunities and increased rates of predation.

==Uses==
===Fishing===

Rainbow trout and steelhead are highly regarded game fish among anglers. Rainbow trout are a popular target for fly fishers, and several lure fishing methods are used. The use of lures presented via spinning, casting, or trolling techniques is common. Rainbow trout can also be caught on various live and dead natural baits. Many anglers consider the rainbow trout the hardest-fighting trout species, as this fish is known for leaping when hooked and putting up a powerful struggle. It is considered one of the top five sport fish in North America, and the most important game fish west of the Rocky Mountains. 

There are tribal commercial fisheries for steelhead in Puget Sound, the Washington coast, and in the Columbia River, but there has been controversy regarding overharvesting of native stocks.

The highly desirable sporting qualities and adaptability of the rainbow trout to hatchery rearing and new habitats resulted in it being introduced to many countries around the world by or at the behest of sport fishermen. Many of these introductions have resulted in environmental and ecological problems, as the introduced rainbow trout disrupt local ecosystems and outcompete or prey upon indigenous fishes. Other introductions to support sport angling in waters either devoid of fish or with seriously depleted native stocks have created world-class fisheries such as in the Firehole River in Yellowstone National Park and in the Great Lakes. 

==== Record ==== 
The International Game Fish Association recognizes the world record for rainbow trout as a fish caught on Saskatchewan&#x27;s Lake Diefenbaker by Sean Konrad on September 5, 2009, which weighed . The record is controversial because the fish was a genetically modified triploid and was part of a large number of triploid rainbow trout which escaped from an aquaculture facility.

=== Water purification ===

Rainbow trout is sometimes used as a biological indicator for water quality in water purification facilities.

===As food===
Rainbow trout is popular in Western cuisine; both wild-caught and farmed fish are eaten. It has tender flesh and a mild, somewhat nutty flavor. Wild fish has a stronger, gamier taste than farmed fish. While the taste of wild-caught trout is often promoted as superior, rainbow trout and &quot;steelhead&quot; sold in American restaurants is typically farmed. Farmed rainbow trout are considered one of the safest fish to eat and are noted for high levels of vitamin B and a generally appealing flavor. Seafood Watch ranks farmed rainbow trout as a &quot;Best Choice&quot; fish for human consumption. In Montana, it is illegal to sell or market wild-caught rainbow trout, which are legally classified as game fish.

The color and flavor of the flesh depend on the diet and freshness of the trout. Farmed trout and some populations of wild trout, especially anadromous steelhead, have reddish or orange flesh as a result of high astaxanthin levels in their diets. Astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant that may be from a natural source or a synthetic trout feed. Rainbow trout raised to have pinker flesh from a diet high in astaxanthin are sometimes sold in the U.S. with labeling calling them &quot;steelhead&quot;. As wild steelhead are in decline in some parts of their range, farmed rainbow trout are viewed as a preferred alternative. In Chile and Norway, rainbow trout farmed in saltwater sea cages are sold labeled as steelhead.

Trout can be cooked as soon as they are cleaned, without scaling, skinning, or filleting. If cooked with the skin on, the meat tends to hold together better. While trout sold commercially in Europe is often prepared and served this way, most trout sold commercially in the United States have the fish heads removed and have been fully or partially deboned and filleted. Medium to heavy-bodied white wines, such as chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, or pinot gris, are typical wine pairings for trout.

In Mainland China since 2018, it was ruled by an industrial association that rainbow trout can be labelled and sold as salmon.

<text>Steelhead, or occasionally steelhead trout, is the anadromous form of the coastal rainbow trout or Columbia River redband trout (&quot;O. m. gairdneri&quot;, also called redband steelhead). Steelhead are native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific basin in Northeast Asia and North America. Like other sea-run (anadromous) trout and salmon, steelhead spawn in freshwater, smolts migrate to the ocean to forage for several years and adults return to their natal streams to spawn. Steelhead are iteroparous, although their survival rate is approximately only 10–20%.

== Description ==

The freshwater form of the steelhead is the rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;). The difference between these forms of the species is that steelhead migrate to the ocean and return to freshwater tributaries to spawn, whereas non-anadromous rainbow trout do not leave freshwater. Steelhead are also larger and less colorful than rainbow trout. Steelhead can weigh up to and reach in length. They can live up to 11 years and spawn multiple times. The body of the steelhead trout is silvery and streamlined with a rounder head. This silver color and round head is what gives the steelhead its name. There are black dots that are more concentrated on the back of the fish and become sparser closer to the lateral line of the fish. Steelhead also develop a pink horizontal stripe. When steelhead return to freshwater to spawn, their color begins to more closely resemble that of a normal rainbow trout. The longer a steelhead spends in freshwater, the darker their green body colorations and horizontal pink stripe become. When a steelhead exits the river and returns to the ocean again, it regains its silvery appearance while in saltwater. The fish develop a larger and stronger tail relative to a normal rainbow trout to help aid in swimming in ocean currents and swimming up strong river currents.

A number of distinct population segments of steelhead are endangered or threatened across the United States, with their decline largely attributed to causes such as changing ocean conditions, overharvest, hatcheries, habitat destruction, and the blocking of waterways by the construction of dams. Human interaction has had considerable consequences on reducing the population of steelhead trout.

== Characteristics ==
Steelhead currently support or have historically supported fisheries across Northern California, and thus they hold &quot;economic as well as cultural value&quot; (Moyle, Israel, &amp; Purdy, 2008). Contrary to popular belief, the California Steelhead is a coastal variation of the same species of fish as the Rainbow Trout, &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;; &quot;rainbow trout are the &#x27;landlocked&#x27; version, and remain in freshwater throughout their life&quot; (King County, 2016)&quot;.&quot; An ocean-going variety, the Steelhead, or &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus&quot; has developed unique adaptive characteristics that distinguish this fish from its common counterpart and have allowed a wider distribution of this species across the Pacific Northwest, including the coastal regions of California. In fact, &quot;coastal rainbow trout is the most widely-distributed native trout form&quot; (CA.gov). Among other necessary biological utilities fulfilled by this species, Steelhead Trout &quot;are also strong indicators of the condition of California&#x27;s streams; large self-sustaining populations of native salmon and trout are found where streams are in reasonably good condition&quot; (Moyle, Israel, &amp; Purdy, 2008). A chrome underside and olive-grey back reminiscent to that of a steel beam are attributed as the main defining physical characteristic for which the Steelhead is distinguished and earns its namesake.
The Steelhead is an ocean-going predatory fish with a typical lifespan of four to six years. Like the common rainbow trout, Steelhead predominantly feast on zooplankton when they are young and then transition to eating fish, some rodents, mollusks, and crustaceans. When these fish enter the open ocean, however, their diet typically consists of squid, crustaceans, and small fish including anchovies, herring, and sardines, though the capacity at which this dietary intake occurs is highly contingent upon the geographical region where Steelhead choose to migrate (Salmon Fishing Now). &quot;Rainbow trout and steelhead represent two divergent ecotypes that are genetically identical but separated by life history strategies&quot; (Heath 2001); the unique biological diversity of the Steelhead Trout from that of the Rainbow Trout is determined through a capacity to migrate to the open ocean. Homing behavior is a unique adaptation of Steelhead Trout that allows the fish to migrate to and from freshwater and saltwater bodies on multiple occasions. Through the process of imprinting, Steelhead Trout deposit a chemical indicator &quot;that is specific to their natal stream&quot; (NRC 1996).

=== Homing behavior ===
Perhaps the most interesting and perplexing characteristic of the Steelhead Trout is its homing behavior and the capacity of this species to accurately detect its primary spawning grounds despite venturing to the open ocean and returning to the same freshwater source on numerous occasions throughout their lives. By recording the concentrations of solutes and the chemical profile of a stream through the biological characteristic of a chemical indicator, steelhead &quot;use the position of the sun and magnetic north to navigate towards spawning grounds &quot; after they have fed in the open ocean for 1–4 whole years (Fulton). Even after traveling hundreds of miles, this chemical imprint allows steelhead to identify their precise hatching grounds upon returning to freshwater. According to &quot;A review of the characteristics, habitat requirements, and ecology of the Anadromous Steelhead Trout&quot; by Fulton, &quot;homing creates genetically different subpopulations that differ by basin, stream, and even location within a stream&quot; (Altukhov 2000). According to a study conducted by Heath &amp; Pollard, &quot;significant genetic variation on the individual, tributary, and watershed level occur between Steelhead Trout populations&quot; as a result of this chemical reliance for breeding practices (Heath, 2001). The author concludes that as a result of such biologically accurate homing characteristics, the Steelhead Trout is &quot;uniquely adapted to its environment&quot;; fish populations &quot;are reasonably isolated from fish that spawn in different areas,&quot; and therefore &quot;sub-populations may differ by the timing of runs, size of fish, and even behavior patterns&quot; (Heath, 2001). This also influences genetic relatedness between Steelhead Trout populations; interestingly, the author found that the genetic similarity of regional Steelhead trout populations &quot;is correlated with distance&quot; (Heath, 2001).

== Spawning ==

During spawning, the fish will lay their eggs on gravel bottoms of freshwater tributaries. The female digs out a hole called a redd. The preferred depth for steelhead spawning is . She then lays the eggs, and a male fertilizes them. The females will then cover the eggs with the gravel. Depending on the size of the female she may lay up to 9,000 eggs. The female then buries the eggs in a foot of gravel. The eggs remain in the gravel until they hatch. Unlike salmon (which can spawn only once) steelhead may return to the ocean, and come back upstream several times for spawning season.

== Atlantic Canada ==
Small numbers of steelhead are present in Atlantic Canada.

== Great Lakes steelhead ==
Steelhead found in the Great Lakes are the freshwater variation of steelhead found in saltwater. Similar to native populations of steelhead on the west coast, Great Lakes steelhead start in tributaries to larger bodies of water, in this case the Great Lakes, where they travel to, to grow to large proportions and reach sexual maturity before returning to the tributaries they started in. Great Lakes steelhead grow to as large as 20 pounds and 36–40 inches but normally average 4–10 pounds and between 20–30 inches. They share very similar characteristics to an ocean-run steelhead as far as their long, slender build and silvery coloration with spots running along their back that very rarely progress beyond their lateral line. As the fish spend more time in the tributaries they darken in coloration while developing a bright red stripe down their midline. While in the lakes they feed on alewives, smelt, and lake herring amongst other things.

The first introduction of steelhead into the Great Lakes dates back to 1876 where smolts were taken from wild populations from the McCloud River in California and placed into the Au Sable River. &quot;Wild&quot; populations of these fish started to become established shortly after their introduction into the lakes. By the late 80s populations could be found in notable rivers like the Muskegon and Pere Marquette. Sometime after their first introduction into Michigan tributaries other states, such as New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, started stocking fish into their own streams. Due to the steelhead&#x27;s large size and powerful demeanor, they&#x27;ve become very attractive amongst the angler community in the Great Lakes area.

== Conservation status ==
There have been several conservation programs created since the near extinction of the steelhead in the 1940s. The reduction in population is mainly due to manmade obstructions within river systems. This is usually caused by dams blocking access, or humans changing the river landscape for recreation and access to water. It is estimated that only 500 steelhead trout return to the Southern California watersheds. However, in other areas of the United States, steelhead can be seen as pests because they are an invasive species to the environment.

=== Southern California ===
While numbers are improving in areas of the Pacific Northwest where Steelhead Trout have typically thrived, the California Steelhead Trout is considered a threatened species, and according to Mark Capelli of the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Southern California steelhead are the most endangered of them all (California Trout). According to California Trout, Steelhead Trout populations began to decline in the &quot;late-1940s due mainly to man-made landscape modifications&quot; (California Trout). As a result of damming for flood control, steelhead migration routes from the coast to upstream spawning grounds were increasingly blocked over time (California Trout). Furthermore, largely a result of continued urbanization and to satisfy the needs of human populations in the area, river flows became modified for recreational purposes and a substantial diversion of water occurred over time (California Trout). As a result of widespread habitat loss and fragmentation, Southern California Steelhead populations were officially labeled as an endangered species in 1997 (California Trout). In some areas, a recent sighting of the Steelhead Trout has not occurred in years, and biologists fear the worst. In 2002, the endangered species label was extended from the Malibu Creek down to the border of San Diego and Mexico (California Trout).

=== Northern California ===

A threatened species since 2000, the Northern California steelhead represents a beacon of hope for continued rehabilitation initiatives and growing population numbers in the area. As of 2016, 48,892 Steelhead Trout were reportedly caught (NOAA). Such a population count suggests that this fascinating fish species continue to persevere in Northern California waters. However, to ensure the continued rehabilitation of steelhead populations in Northern California, a positive, directive plan of action for steelhead conservation must occur. According to NOAA, The State of California Fisheries Restoration Grant Program (FRGP) &quot;invested over 250 million dollars and supported approximately 3,500 salmonid restoration projects&quot; (NOAA). Investments in projects improving &quot;fish passage, water quality, instream habitat restoration, watershed monitoring, and education and organizational support&quot; all occupy conservation efforts to improve Northern California steelhead populations (NOAA). According to NOAA, &quot;the percentage of floodplain and in-channel habitat that would need to be restored to detect a 25% increase in salmon and steelhead production was 20%&quot; (NOAA). As it stands, &quot;more than 20% of floodplain and in-channel habitat has been restored due to FRGP&quot; (NOAA). Though these initiatives spell hope for the prospects of Steelhead Trout population rehabilitation, habitat degradation continues to occur at an alarming rate.

=== Oregon ===

Within the state of Oregon there are four different distinct steelhead population segments: Lower Columbia River steelhead, Middle Columbia River steelhead, Oregon Coast steelhead, and Upper Willamette River Steelhead (NOAA). Of these four segments, three are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The Middle Columbia River (MCR) segment has remained the focus of recent recovery efforts. The MCR segment covers approximately 3,500 square miles of the Columbia Plateau in eastern Oregon and Washington. Within eastern Oregon, recovery efforts focus on the two main tributaries to the Columbia River: The Deschutes River and the John Day River, although the Umatilla and Walla Walla are also included in recovery plans. Primary threats to MCR steelhead populations include hydrosystem operations, habitat alteration, and effects of stray naturally spawning hatchery fish. MCR steelhead were first listed as threatened on March 25, 1999, following the construction of Round Butte Dam at the confluence of the Deschutes and Metolius rivers. The construction of the dam created reverse currents (currents flowing upstream) in the Metolius Arm of Lake Billy Chinook (a reservoir created by the formation of the dam) confusing anadromous smolts and preventing them from navigating seaward. The construction of Round Butte Dam impeded steelhead access to the Upper Deschutes, Crooked, and Metolius rivers, three major tributaries to the Deschutes within the MCR watershed. In addition to Round Butte, several other dams restrict fish from their native spawning grounds within the Deschutes watershed including Pelton Dam, Bowman Dam, and Ochoco Dam. The first MCR Distinct Population Segment ESA Recovery Plan was released on November 30, 1999. Between 2010 and 2016 1,715 different entities have implemented 1,559 tributary restoration projects primarily focused on habitat restoration and fish passage improvement. In a 2016 an action plan implementation progress report stated the population is &quot;maintained&quot; showing no significant upward or downward trend in the yearly number of returning adults in an experimental small tributary to the Deschutes River. However, fish counts at Boneville Dam, on the Columbia River below the Deschutes confluence have shown a 10 year (2013–2022) average of 162,988 returning adults, and a four year (2019–2022) average of 97,352, suggesting a recent decline in rates of returning adults.

<text>KUSA (channel 9) is a television station in Denver, Colorado, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside MyNetworkTV affiliate KTVD (channel 20). The two stations share studios on East Speer Boulevard in Denver&#x27;s Speer neighborhood; KUSA&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Lookout Mountain, near Golden. In addition to its main studios, the station also operates a secondary studio and news bureau on Canyon Avenue in Fort Collins.

==History==
===Early years to the mid-1990s===
The station first signed on the air on October 12, 1952, as KBTV; it was the second television station to sign on in the Denver market—after KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV), which signed on just over three months earlier on July 18. Founded by Mullins Broadcasting, the station initially served as a primary affiliate of CBS, but also carried programs from ABC and NBC through secondary affiliations with both networks. It originally operated from studio facilities located in a converted former car dealership at 1089 Bannock Street in Denver&#x27;s Civic Center neighborhood. Channel 9 gained an affiliation with the DuMont Television Network in 1953, but lost CBS programming to KLZ-TV (channel 7, now KMGH-TV) when that station signed on in November of that year; this was followed by the loss of the NBC affiliation to KOA-TV (channel 4, now KCNC-TV) when it signed on a month later (both KLZ-TV and KOA-TV inherited the affiliations as a result of their sister radio stations&#x27; respective longtime affiliations with the CBS Radio Network and the NBC Red Network). This left KBTV as a primary DuMont and secondary ABC affiliate. It would become a full-time ABC affiliate when DuMont ceased operations in 1956. Its radio news partner was KBTR (now KNUS); both stations were owned by Mullins Broadcasting, and the radio partnership lasted until the mid-1980s.

 In 1972, Mullins Broadcasting sold KBTV and sister station KARK-TV (channel 4) in Little Rock, Arkansas, to the Combined Communications Corporation, owned jointly by Phoenix advertising mogul Karl Eller and Chicago advertiser John J. Louis Sr., which already owned its flagship advertising business and stations KTAR-AM and KTAR-TV (channel 12, now KPNX-TV). Combined&#x27;s station properties would eventually be merged into the Gannett Company seven years later in May 1978, in what was the largest media merger in United States history at the time.

In order to align itself with Gannett&#x27;s new newspaper entity &quot;USA Today&quot;, the station changed its call letters to KUSA-TV on March 19, 1984 (Minneapolis–Saint Paul sister station WTCN underwent a similar rebranding in 1985, when it changed its call letters to WUSA; however, after Gannett purchased Washington, D.C. station WDVM-TV in 1986, it moved the WUSA call letters to its newly acquired station; the Minneapolis station that originally held the WUSA calls was renamed KARE-TV). The KBTV call letters are now at a station in Beaumont, Texas. In April 1992, KUSA moved its operations into a new state-of-the-art facility at 500 Speer Boulevard (the original studio location was subsequently occupied by PBS member station KRMA-TV (channel 6)).

===NBC affiliation (1995–present)===

On July 14, 1994, as a result of an affiliation agreement between the E. W. Scripps Company and ABC that was spurred by Fox&#x27;s affiliation deal with New World Communications, CBS and Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W) agreed to a long-term affiliation deal that saw longtime ABC affiliate WJZ-TV in Baltimore and longtime NBC affiliates KYW-TV in Philadelphia and WBZ-TV in Boston become CBS affiliates. Westinghouse&#x27;s other two stations, KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh and KPIX-TV in San Francisco, were already longtime CBS affiliates. That November, NBC traded KCNC-TV, which was the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated station at the time, to CBS in return for CBS&#x27; former O&amp;O in Philadelphia, WCAU, as a result of a complex ownership deal between the network, Westinghouse and NBC. CBS had originally planned to sell WCAU to NBC as part of its plan to move its affiliation to KYW-TV, but discovered that an outright sale would incur heavy capital gains taxes on proceeds from the deal. To make the transaction a legal trade, the network swapped ownership of KCNC-TV and KUTV in Salt Lake City (which NBC had acquired earlier that year), along with the VHF channel 4 frequency and transmitter in Miami (then home to WTVJ), to CBS in exchange for WCAU and the channel 6 frequency in Miami (then home to WCIX, which subsequently became WFOR-TV). NBC then signed an affiliation agreement with KUSA, bypassing Denver&#x27;s incumbent CBS affiliate, KMGH-TV.

Gannett then signed a multi-station affiliation agreement with NBC that included KUSA. This resulted in all three of Denver&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; stations swapping affiliations at 12:07 a.m. on September 10, 1995, which resulted in KUSA switching to NBC, KMGH switching to ABC, and KCNC switching to CBS; Westinghouse had purchased CBS in a group deal one month before, making KCNC a CBS owned-and-operated station when the deal was finalized on November 24 of that year. The final ABC program to air on channel 9 was a repeat of the &quot;ABC Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; feature &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;, on September 9, 1995.

In July 1996, Rapid City NBC affiliate KEVN-TV opted to join Fox, leaving the Black Hills region of South Dakota without a full-power NBC affiliate. As a result, most cable providers in that region began piping in KUSA. Channel 9 served as the market&#x27;s default NBC affiliate until 1998, when KNBN-LP signed on as the network&#x27;s new affiliate for the Black Hills region; that station was not carried on cable until it was upgraded to full-power as KNBN on May 14, 2000.

In August 2007, KUSA began the &quot;9NEWS High School Hotshots Program&quot;, which awarded one of twelve student athletes from Colorado&#x27;s high schools nominated for their academic excellence, selected by the school&#x27;s administration and staff that recorded their high school football games; the program has since extended to cover winter sports at the schools.

Like many Gannett stations, KUSA dropped the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix ten days after the official digital television transition date of June 12, 2009, although KUSA had made the transition to digital-exclusive broadcasts nearly two months earlier.

Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for KUSA and KTVD, thus taking a big chunk out of the pockets of potential advertisers in the Rocky Mountains. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (including KUSA and KTVD) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. KUSA and KTVD were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

==Programming==
KUSA clears the entire NBC schedule, although it airs the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; one hour later than most NBC affiliates at 11 a.m., and until September 2022, aired &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (now streaming exclusively on Peacock) at 2 p.m. (the secondary slot to NBC&#x27;s primary recommended 1 p.m. timeslot), with syndicated programs airing in the preceding hour (&quot;Days&quot; aired on KUSA at 3 p.m. upon joining NBC in 1995 and continued to air in that slot until the fall of 2003, when it acquired &quot;Ellen&quot; and moved &quot;Days&quot; to 1 p.m., where it remained until the 2007 cancellation of &quot;Passions&quot;). It also airs NBC&#x27;s &quot;Heart of a Champion&quot; on Wednesday afternoons instead of the show&#x27;s recommended early Saturday afternoon time slot (most NBC stations air it at 12:30 p.m. on Saturdays).

The station struggled in the ratings for several years, in part because ABC&#x27;s overall ratings were not on par with the other major networks until the 1970s. The station lost the DuMont affiliation when the network shut down on August 6, 1956, which left the station as an exclusive ABC affiliate. In 1969, the station gained some national attention for refusing to air the ABC sketch comedy series &quot;Turn-On&quot; as the network&#x27;s affiliates east of the Rocky Mountains voiced displeasure about the program&#x27;s risqué content during the airing of the pilot episode, with some pulling the program off the air during its broadcast, leading to its cancellation by the network after just one episode.

On the day KUSA joined NBC, it took over KCNC&#x27;s role as the default home station for the Denver Broncos (who are part of the AFC, which NBC held the broadcast rights to then, channel 4 had aired most Broncos games from 1965 until the 1995 season-opening game a week before the switch), but would only hold this role for only three seasons; however, channel 9 did air the Broncos&#x27; first Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl XXXII in 1998 (it also happened to be the last Broncos game aired on the station [and the last NFL game for NBC] for eight years); after this, KCNC, thanks to CBS&#x27; acquisition of the AFC broadcast rights, resumed its role as the home station of the team. Since 2006, Broncos games are aired on channel 9 when they are shown on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. KUSA also aired any Denver Nuggets contests via the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; from 1995 to 2002, and Colorado Avalanche games via the &quot;NHL on NBC&quot; from 2006 to 2021.

KUSA produces a daily lifestyle program called &quot;Colorado &amp; Company&quot;, that features paid segments by local companies and made its debut in September 2004; it airs at 10 a.m. following the third hour of &quot;Today&quot;. &quot;Colorado &amp; Company&quot; was rebroadcast on KPXC-TV (channel 59) from its debut, until the conclusion of NBC&#x27;s affiliate partnership and partial ownership of Pax TV in June 2005. KUSA ran the Gannett ID and sounder (often colloquially nicknamed the &quot;Death Star&quot;) at the end of the station&#x27;s weeknight 6 p.m. newscasts from 1994 to 2011; in June 2011, KUSA began to show Gannett&#x27;s new corporate ID tag at the end of all of the station&#x27;s newscasts, except for the weekday morning programs; as of December 2015, they show Tegna&#x27;s ID after all of their newscasts.

Beginning with the 2024–25 NBA season and the 2024–25 NHL season, sister station KTVD-TV reached an agreement with Altitude Sports and Entertainment to simulcast 20 Denver Nuggets games and 20 Colorado Avalanche games. 10 games will also be simulcast on KUSA. This will be in addition to any games selected for broadcast on Tuesday nights when NBC&#x27;s NBA contract begins in the 2025–26 season.

===News operation===

KUSA presently broadcasts a total of 40 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours on weekdays, hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays); this does not account for newscasts aired on KTVD (Combined however, &quot;9 News&quot; broadcasts hours of local news, and has the second highest local newscast output in the state of Colorado behind Nexstar&#x27;s KDVR and KWGN combined). The station also provides daily weather forecasts for the formerly co-owned &quot;Fort Collins Coloradoan&quot; newspaper. Until November 2016, KUSA provided local weather updates for six radio stations owned by Entercom: KQMT (99.5 FM), KALC (105.9 FM), K276FK (103.1 FM), KQKS (107.5 FM), KKSE (950 AM) and KEZW (1430 AM); this partnership began on January 1, 2008, after the station&#x27;s agreement to provide forecasts for KOA (850 AM) radio ended. Weather segments during the station&#x27;s newscasts are typically presented in the &quot;9 Back Yard&quot;, a courtyard outside the Speer Boulevard studios that features a chroma key wall and robotic camera (local weather inserts for &quot;The Today Show&quot; and updates for 9NEWS Now are done from a chroma key wall inside the weather center).

In addition to its main studios in downtown Denver, KUSA operates a &quot;Northern Newsroom&quot; that based out of the &quot;Coloradoan&quot; offices in Fort Collins; the bureau employs a rotating staff of reporters and photojournalists out of Denver. The station also operates a &quot;Mountain Newsroom&quot; based in Silverthorne. The station&#x27;s weather radar is presented on-air as &quot;HD-Doppler 9&quot;, a DWSR-10001C radar model supplied by Enterprise Electronics Corporation that is located near Elizabeth and operates at a radiated power of 1 million watts. KUSA brands its websites and sister television properties under the &quot;9NEWS Networks&quot; banner (described by KUSA as its three websites: 9News.com, m.9News.com and HighSchoolSports.net; KTVD (channel 20) and its website; the 9NEWS Now digital subchannel; Metromix; Telemundo owned-and-operated station KDEN-TV (channel 25, whose Spanish-language newscasts are produced by KUSA through a news share agreement) and the &quot;9NEWS Weather Call&quot; weather alert service).

For the better part of the last four decades, KUSA&#x27;s newscasts (currently titled as &quot;9NEWS&quot;) have dominated Denver&#x27;s local news ratings. In February 1976, Ed Sardella and John Rayburn anchored the weeknight editions of the 10 p.m. newscast, helping that program overtake longtime leader KMGH-TV for first place in the ratings; Rayburn was succeeded by Mike Landess in 1977. Landess and Sardella would remain as channel 9&#x27;s top anchor team until Landess left for KUSA&#x27;s Atlanta sister station WXIA-TV in late 1993. Adele Arakawa, who had been an anchor at WBBM-TV in Chicago, was hired to succeed Landess. Sardella retired from the anchor desk in 2000, and was succeeded by Jim Benemann, but returned briefly in 2003 to replace Benemann when he left for KCNC-TV. Landess, after anchoring at WTTG in Washington, D.C., returned to Denver at rival KMGH-TV in 2002.

The &quot;KUSA News Package&quot; (created by Third Street Music) was commissioned by KUSA as the theme music for its newscasts in 1995. Scenes for the NBC made-for-TV movie &quot;Asteroid&quot; were shot at the KUSA studios, the producers filmed the fictional news reports seen in the movie out of the station&#x27;s 1996–2004 news set. On October 15, 2008, KUSA debuted a standardized graphics package for the Gannett stations created by the Gannett Graphics Group, along with a standardized music package composed by Rampage Music New York. The closing cut of the previous theme was last used on February 6, 2009, and the remastered talent bumper cut was used until January 10, 2013 (Minneapolis sister station KARE continued to use its own custom theme composed in 1996 by Third Street Music called the &quot;KARE 11 News Theme&quot; until January 25, 2013, when it discontinued it for a new standardized news package by Gari Media Group called &quot;This Is Home&quot;). KUSA formerly rebroadcast its weeknight 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts on KPXC-TV as part of an agreement between NBC and Pax TV to provide news re-broadcasts from the network&#x27;s stations on Pax&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations nationally, which ended in June 2005 upon that network&#x27;s rebrand to I: Independent Television.

In April 2004, KUSA became the first television station in the Denver market, the first Gannett-owned station and the second U.S. television station to begin producing its local newscasts in high definition. On September 5, 2006, KUSA began to produce a daily half-hour prime time newscast at 9 p.m. on sister station KTVD, coinciding with that station&#x27;s affiliation switch from UPN to MyNetworkTV; this expanded on December 5, 2006, to include a two-hour extension of KUSA&#x27;s weekday morning newscast from 7 to 9 a.m. and later to weekend morning newscasts at 6 a.m. on KTVD. During the November 2007 sweeps period, KCNC&#x27;s newscasts surged over KUSA in the 5 p.m. timeslot for the first time in over a decade, that station also overtook KUSA in overall sign-on to sign-off numbers (this is partially due to KCNC&#x27;s shift towards investigative reports and human interest stories, though the strength of CBS&#x27; prime time lineup and viewership declines for NBC prime time also played a factor). Overall, KUSA remains the highest-rated local news outlet in the market despite a very close ratings battle between it, KCNC-TV and KMGH-TV.

On March 6, 2009, KUSA began streaming its noon newscast on the station&#x27;s website, with a live chat room feature included next to the streaming player (the station now streams all newscasts seen on KUSA and KTVD). In June 2010, KUSA expanded its weekday morning newscast to hours with the addition of a half-hour at 4:30 a.m.; the KUSA-produced 9 p.m. newscast on KTVD also expanded to one hour that month. On February 20, 2012, KUSA updated its HD-ready set constructed in 2004 to feature a new backdrop for its daytime newscasts that is a variant of its evening backdrop photograph in a daytime setting. On June 3 of that year, KUSA&#x27;s newscasts were relocated to a temporary set in &quot;Studio B&quot; for two weeks while their primary news set received updated duratrans.

In January 2016, KUSA announced that they would be constructing a brand new studio to &quot;better cover and explain the news.&quot; The new studio and set, which was completed in March, replaced the previous one, which debuted in 2004. Newscasts were relocated to the news room temporarily before moving to another temporary set.

==In popular culture==
A newscast from the station (as KBTV) was featured prominently in the 1980 Stanley Kubrick film &quot;The Shining&quot;, set in Colorado.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

In April 2005, KUSA began carrying NBC Weather Plus on its second digital subchannel (branded as &quot;9NEWS Weather Plus&quot;). On December 31, 2008, following NBC Weather Plus&#x27; shutdown, KUSA affiliated the subchannel with The Local AccuWeather Channel; on May 27, 2013, as part of a multi-station deal between Gannett and the network, KUSA 9.2 switched its affiliation to WeatherNation TV. Digital subchannel 9.2 is carried on cable through Comcast digital channel 249 and CenturyLink Prism channel 10. On August 27, 2017, at noon MDT, KUSA temporarily switched digital subchannel 9.2 from WeatherNation TV to a live feed of a WFAA/KHOU simulcast covering the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey after it flooded the Houston metro area. This simulcast ended on August 31, 2017, at 6:30 p.m. MDT when the subchannel returned to WeatherNation TV. On December 29, 2018, KUSA dropped WeatherNation TV from the channel and switched to Cozi TV.

In late January 2015, KUSA began to broadcast a duplicate 1080i signal of their primary digital subchannel (9.1) on the KTVD (RF 31) transmitter as digital subchannel 9.4, &quot;KUSA-HD&quot;. This allows viewers with issues receiving KUSA&#x27;s VHF signal or with a UHF-only antenna to view KUSA in some form over the air.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KUSA shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on April 16, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 16 to VHF channel 9.

===Translators===
KUSA operates a large network of translators to relay its signal to portions of Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming within and adjacent to the Denver market.

<text>The Derg (or Dergue; , ), officially the Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC), was the Ethiopian state (including present-day Eritrea) that existed first from 1974 to 1987 as a military dictatorship and then until 1991 when the military junta formally &quot;civilianized&quot; the administration although remained in power.

The Derg was established on 21 June 1974 as the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police and Territorial Army, by junior and mid level officers of the Imperial Ethiopian Army and members of the police. The officers decided everything collectively at first, and selected Mengistu Haile Mariam to chair the proceedings. On 12 September 1974, the Derg overthrew the government of the Ethiopian Empire and Emperor Haile Selassie during nationwide mass protests, and three days later formally renamed itself the Provisional Military Administrative Council. In March 1975 the Derg abolished the monarchy and established Ethiopia as a socialist state under a military-led provisional government. The abolition of feudalism, increased literacy, nationalization, and sweeping land reform including the resettlement and villagization from the Ethiopian Highlands became priorities. Mengistu became chairman in 1977, launching the Red Terror (&quot;Qey Shibir&quot;) political repression campaign to eliminate political opponents, with tens of thousands imprisoned and executed without trial.

By the mid-1980s, Ethiopia was plagued by multiple issues, such as droughts, economic decline and increasing reliance on foreign aid, recovering from the Ogaden War, and the 1983–1985 famine from which the Derg itself estimated more than a million deaths during its time in power. Conflicts between the Derg and various ethnic militias saw a gradual resurgence, particularly the Ethiopian Civil War and the Eritrean War of Independence. Mengistu formally abolished the Derg in 1987 and formed a Marxist-Leninist one party state, the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia led by the Workers&#x27; Party of Ethiopia, with a new government containing civilians but still dominated by members of the Derg.

In May 1991, the Derg regime fell to the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front, ending the civil war that had been ongoing since 1974 following the toppling of the Ethiopian Empire.

==History==

Before the revolution, the Ethiopian Student Movement presented a threat to the monarchy. Many of their ideals were similar to those of the Derg.

===Formation and growth===
After the Ethiopian Revolution in February 1974, the first signal of any mass uprisings was the actions of the soldiers of the 4th Brigade of the 4th Army Division in Nagelle in southern Ethiopia. They were mainly unhappy about the lack of food and water and then arrested their brigade commander and other officers and kept them incarcerated. When the government sent the commander of the Ethiopian Ground Forces, General Deresse Dubala, to negotiate with the rebels, they held him and forced him to eat their food and drink their water. Similar mutinies took place at the Ethiopian Air Force base at Bishoftu on 12 February, and at Second Division at Asmara on 25 February. It was these protests that gave rise to the general uprising among the civilian segments such as students and trade unions.

The Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police and Territorial Army, known as the Derg, was officially announced on 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers. This was done under the pretext of maintaining law and order, due to the powerlessness of the civilian government following widespread mutiny in the armed forces of Ethiopia earlier that year. Its members were not directly involved in those mutinies nor was this the first military committee organized to support the administration of Prime Minister Endelkachew Makonnen. Alem Zewde Tessema had established the armed forces coordinated committee on 23 March. Over the following months, radicals in the Ethiopian military came to believe Makonnen was acting on behalf of the hated feudal aristocracy. When a group of notables petitioned for the release of a number of government ministers and officials who were under arrest for corruption and other crimes, three days later the Derg was announced.

The Derg, which originally consisted of soldiers at the capital, broadened its membership by including representatives from the 40 units of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Kebur Zabagna (Imperial Guard), Territorial Army and police: each unit was expected to send three representatives, who were supposed to be privates, NCOs and junior officers up to the rank of major. According to Bahru Zewde, &quot;Senior officers were deemed too compromised by close association to the regime.&quot; The Derg was reported to have consisted of 120 soldiers, a statement which has gained wide acceptance due to the habitual secretiveness of the Derg in its early years. But, Bahru Zewde notes that &quot;in actual fact, their number was less than 110&quot;, and Aregawi Berhe mentions two different sources which record 109 persons as being members of the Derg. No new members were ever admitted, and the number decreased, especially in the first few years, as some members were expelled or killed. 

The Derg first assembled at the Fourth Division headquarters, and elected Major Mengistu Haile Mariam as its chairman and Major Atnafu Abate as vice-chairman. Their stated mission was to study and address the grievances of various military units, investigate abuses by senior officers and staff and root out corruption in the military. In July, the Derg obtained key concessions from emperor, Haile Selassie, which included the power to arrest not only military officers but government officials at every level. Soon both former Prime Ministers Aklilu Habte-Wold and Endelkachew Makonnen, along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court were imprisoned. In August, after a proposed constitution creating a constitutional monarchy was presented to the emperor, the Derg began a program of dismantling the imperial government to forestall further developments in that direction. The Derg deposed and imprisoned the emperor on 12 September 1974.

On 15 September, the committee renamed itself the Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC) and took full control of the government and all facilities within the government. The Derg chose Lieutenant General Aman Andom, a popular military leader and a Sandhurst graduate, to be its chairman and acting head-of-state. This was pending the return of Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen from medical treatment in Europe when he would assume the throne as a constitutional monarch. However, General Aman Andom quarreled with the radical elements in the Derg over the issue of a new military offensive in Eritrea and their proposal to execute the high officials of Selassie&#x27;s former government. After eliminating units loyal to him—the Engineers, the Imperial Bodyguard and the Air Force—the Derg removed General Aman from power and executed him on 23 November 1974, along with some of his supporters and 60 officials of the previous Imperial government.

Brigadier General Tafari Benti became the new Chairman of the Derg and the head of state, with Mengistu and Atnafu Abate as his two vice-chairmen, both with promotions to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. The monarchy was formally abolished in March 1975, and socialism was proclaimed the new ideology of the state. Emperor Haile Selassie died under mysterious circumstances on 27 August 1975 while his personal physician was absent. It is commonly believed that Mengistu killed him, either by ordering it done or by his own hand although the former is considered more likely. Both Derg and Haile Selassie government relocated numerous Amharas into southern Ethiopia, including present-day of the Oromia region, where they served in government administration, courts, church and school, where Oromo texts were eliminated and replaced by Amharic.

===Under Mengistu&#x27;s leadership===

After internal conflicts that resulted in the execution of General Tafari Benti and several of his supporters in February 1977, and the execution of Colonel Atnafu Abate in November 1977, Mengistu gained undisputed leadership of the Derg. In 1987, he formally dissolved the Derg and established the country as the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) under a new constitution.

Many of the Derg members remained in key government posts and also served as the members of the Central Committee and the Politburo of the Workers&#x27; Party of Ethiopia (WPE). This became Ethiopia&#x27;s civilian version of the Eastern bloc communist parties. Mengistu became Secretary-General of the WPE and President of the PDRE while remaining the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.

====Ethiopian Civil War====

Opposition to the reign of the Derg was the main cause of the Ethiopian Civil War. This conflict began as extralegal violence between 1975 and 1977, known as the Red Terror, when the Derg struggled for authority, first with various opposition groups within the country, then with a variety of groups jockeying for the role of vanguard party. Though human rights violations were committed by all sides, the great majority of abuses against civilians as well as actions leading to devastating famine were committed by the government.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which represents the Christian state church of Ethiopia for centuries, was disestablished in 1974. The Derg declared a policy of state atheism, a tenet of Marxist-Leninist ideology; this was opposed by the vast majority of the Ethiopian population.

On 4 March 1975, the Derg announced a program of land reform, according to its main slogan of &quot;Land to the Tiller&quot;, which was unequivocally radical, even in Soviet and Chinese terms. It nationalized all rural land, abolished tenancy and put peasants in charge of enforcing the whole scheme. Many students embraced Mengistu as a &#x27;the hero of the reform&#x27;. In addition, the Derg in 1975 nationalized most industries and private and somewhat secured urban real-estate holdings. Mismanagement, corruption and general opposition to the Derg&#x27;s dictatorial and violent communist rule, coupled with the draining effects of constant warfare with the separatist guerrilla movements in Eritrea and Tigray, led to a drastic fall in general productivity of food and cash crops. Eritreans came under increased oppression and economic disruption at the hands of the regime.

During 1976, civilian opposition to the regime was ruthlessly cracked down on following an attempt on Mengistu&#x27;s life. In some cases entire families were executed based on the accusation of being &#x27;reactionary&#x27;. These grouped ranged from the conservative and pro-monarchy Ethiopian Democratic Union to the far-leftist Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF) guerrillas fighting for Eritrean independence, rebels based in Tigray (which included the nascent Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front) and other groups. For some time, the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF), had been conducting guerilla operations in the Ogaden. By June 1977, it had succeeded in forcing the Ethiopian army out of much of the region and into fortified urban centers. During the Ogaden War that soon followed, Somalia launched a full-scale invasion to assist the WSLF. Under the Derg, Ethiopia became the Soviet bloc&#x27;s closest ally in Africa and became one of the best-armed nations in the region as a result of massive military aid, chiefly from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Cuba and North Korea.

In October 1978, the Derg announced the National Revolutionary Development Campaign to mobilize human and material resources to transform the economy, which led to a ten-year plan (1984/85 - 1993/94) to expand agricultural and industrial output, forecasting a 6.5% growth in GDP and a 3.6% rise in per capita income. Instead, per capita income declined considerably to 0.8% over this period.

Many Ethiopians viewed the revolution as a mask to perpetuate Amhara colonization that began during Emperor Menelik II. By 1978 the proportion of Amhara officials running the Ethiopian government was higher than it has ever been - even under Menelik and Selassie. By 1980, the original 120 members of the Derg had been whittled down to only 38. All members but three were ethnic Amhara and were predominantly from settler colonialist &quot;neftenya&quot; origins. Many member of the ruling elite were deeply opposed to the idea of loosening control on the rebellious southern regions conquered under Menelik II.

====1983–85 famine====

Famine scholar Alex de Waal observed that while the famine that struck the country in the mid-1980s is usually ascribed to drought, closer investigation shows that widespread drought occurred only some months after the famine was already underway. Hundreds of thousands fled economic misery, conscription and political repression and went to live in neighbouring countries and all over the Western world, creating, for the first time, an Ethiopian diaspora.

====Aid and controversy====
The 1984–1985 Tigray famine brought the political situation in Ethiopia to the attention of the world and inspired charitable drives in Western nations, notably by Oxfam and the Live Aid concerts of July 1985. The money they raised was distributed among NGOs working in Ethiopia. A controversy arose when it was found that some of these NGOs were under Derg control or influence and that some Oxfam and Live Aid money had been used to fund Derg&#x27;s enforced resettlement programmes, under which they displaced millions of people and killed between 50,000 and 100,000. A BBC investigation reported that Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front rebels had used millions of dollars of aid money to buy arms; these accusations were later fully retracted by the corporation.

====Dissolution and trials====

Although the Derg government came to an end on 22 February 1987, three weeks after a referendum approved the constitution for the PDRE, it was not until September that the new government was fully in place and the Derg formally abolished. The surviving members of the Derg, including Mengistu, remained in power as the leaders of the new civilian regime.

The geopolitical situation became unfavourable for the communist government in the late 1980s, with the Soviet Union retreating from the expansion of Communism under Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika.&quot; Socialist bloc countries drastically reduced their aid to Ethiopia and were struggling to keep their own economies going. This resulted in even more economic hardship, and the military gave way in the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north. The Soviet Union stopped aiding the PDRE altogether in December 1990. Together with the fall of Communism in the Eastern Bloc in the Revolutions of 1989, this itself dealt a serious blow to the PDRE.

Towards the end of January 1991, a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) captured Gondar (the ancient capital city), Bahir Dar and Dessie. Meanwhile, the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front had gained control of all of Eritrea except for Asmara and Assab in the south. The Soviet Union, mired in its internal turmoil, could no longer prop up the Derg. In the words of the former US diplomat Paul B. Henze, &quot;As his doom became imminent, Mengistu alternated between vowing resistance to the end and hinting that he might follow Emperor Tewodros II&#x27;s example and commit suicide.&quot; His actions were frantic: he convened the Shengo, for an emergency session and reorganized his cabinet, but as Henze concludes, &quot;these shifts came too late to be effective.&quot; On 21 May, claiming that he was going to inspect troops at a base in southern Ethiopia, Mengistu slipped out of the country into Kenya. From there, he flew along with his immediate family to Zimbabwe, where he was granted asylum and where he still resides. 
Mengistu was sentenced to death in 2008 &quot;in absentia&quot;, charged with genocide, homicide, illegal imprisonment and property seizures. In 2009, Zimbabwe&#x27;s late former Information Minister, Tichaona Jokonya, in an interview with Voice of America said Harare was not going to extradite Mengistu. 
In August 2018, Ethiopian former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn while heading an African Union election observer mission in Harare met with Mengistu, and shared their photo on Facebook, which was quickly deleted as it proved so controversial and generally unpopular. It is thought that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who had at that time released thousands of political prisoners, had approved the visit possibly because some opposition groups had used Mengistu&#x27;s image to voice their disapproval of Abiy&#x27;s policies.
In May 2022, Zimbabwe&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Frederick Shava gave a clear sign that Harare would be prepared to extradite Mengistu in a reversal of Jokonya&#x27;s policy. Given the turmoil in Ethiopia with the Tigray conflict, there have been no further apparent developments.

Upon entering Addis Ababa, the EPRDF immediately disbanded the WPE and arrested almost all of the prominent Derg officials shortly after. In December 2006, seventy-three officials of the Derg were found guilty of genocide. Thirty-four people were in court, fourteen others had died during the lengthy process, and twenty-five, including Mengistu, were tried &quot;in absentia&quot;. The trial ended 26 May 2008, and many of the officials were sentenced to death. In December 2010, the Ethiopian government commuted the death sentence of 23 Derg officials. On 4 October 2011, 16 former Derg officials were freed after twenty years of incarceration. The Ethiopian government paroled almost all of the Derg officials who had been imprisoned for 20 years. Other Derg ex-officials managed to escape and organized rebel groups to overthrow Ethiopia&#x27;s new government. One of these groups is the Ethiopian Unity Patriots Front which waged an insurgency in the Gambela Region from 1993 to 2012.

At the conclusion of a trial lasting from 1994 to 2006, Mengistu was convicted of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to death by an Ethiopian court for his role in Ethiopia&#x27;s Red Terror. The Ethiopian legal definition is distinct from the legal definition as outlined in the Genocide Convention by the United Nations and other definitions in that it defines genocide as intent to wipe out political and not just ethnic groups. In this respect, it closely resembles the definition of politicide outlined by Barbara Harff, who wrote in 1992 that no Communist country or governing body had been convicted of genocide.

==Military==

The Derg army had significant role in the government and enforcing law since the establishment. By 1976, the Soviet and Derg relations strengthened with the Soviet aided the Derg military with arms. Together with the Cuban soldiers, the military gained support against Somali Democratic Republic during the Ogaden War. According to the United States State Department report in May 1977, 50 Cuban advisors trained Ethiopian troops to combat, while another report in July stated that 3,000 Cubans were in Ethiopia with one Eritrean Liberation Front officer there.

Under the Derg, the Ethiopian military was dominated by the Amhara ethnic group. Similar to the period of the Ethiopian Empire under Menelik II and Haile Selassie, over 80% of generals and over 65% of colonels in the armed forces were Amhara&#x27;s. While the Amhara constituted the majority of the officer corps, the army was still ethnically heterogeneous.

By 1980, the Derg was estimated to have an excess of 250,000 troops. This was estimated to have cost between 50 and 70 percent of the Ethiopian national budget since 1978. After the regimes fall in 1991, the army of the Derg were only 45,000 troops which disintegrated shortly afterwards.

<text>In the United States, a commencement speech or commencement address is a speech given to graduating students, generally at a university, although the term is also used for secondary education institutions and in similar institutions around the world.

The commencement is a ceremony in which degrees or diplomas are conferred upon graduating students. A commencement speech is typically given by a notable figure in the community or a graduating student. The person giving such a speech is known as a commencement speaker. Very commonly, colleges or universities will invite politicians, important citizens, or other noted speakers to come and address the graduating class.

A student speaker may deliver remarks either in lieu or in conjunction with a notable outside figure. Student commencement speakers are often valedictorians or may otherwise be elected by their peers to represent the student body.

Despite meaning &quot;beginning&quot;, &quot;commencement&quot; may be mistaken to mean &quot;ending&quot; due to its association with the end of one&#x27;s studies. Its usage originated with students finishing their studies and being awarded a degree, thus commencing as bachelors or masters in a subject and enjoying new privileges within academia.

==Notable commencement speeches==
* Winston Churchill at Harrow School in 1941
* George C. Marshall at Harvard University in 1947: the Marshall Plan
* John F. Kennedy&#x27;s American University speech in 1963
* Richard Feynman at the California Institute of Technology in 1974: &quot;Cargo cult science&quot;
* Joseph Brodsky at the University of Michigan in 1988: &quot;Speech at the Stadium&quot;
*Steve Jobs at Stanford University in 2005
*David Foster Wallace at Kenyon College in 2005: &quot;This Is Water&quot;

<text>KTVD (channel 20) is a television station in Denver, Colorado, United States, affiliated with MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside NBC affiliate KUSA (channel 9). The two stations share studios on East Speer Boulevard in Denver&#x27;s Speer neighborhood; KTVD&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Lookout Mountain (near Golden).

KTVD began broadcasting as Denver&#x27;s third major independent station on December 1, 1988. Its initial owner, Twenver Inc., sank under the weight of a weak local advertising market and expensive programming purchases and filed for bankruptcy reorganization within two years of launching the station; Twenver&#x27;s financial issues caused the station&#x27;s primary programming attraction, Denver Nuggets basketball, to break ties. In 1993, the station was acquired out of bankruptcy by the Chicago-based Newsweb Corporation, which focused the station on entertainment and sports programming with the new UPN network and broadcasts of the Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, and Colorado Rockies.

The station was acquired by Gannett—the predecessor to Tegna—in 2006. KTVD&#x27;s operations were consolidated with KUSA, and it added morning and evening newscasts to expand that station&#x27;s market-leading news presence. As a consequence of being bypassed in the merger of UPN and The WB into The CW, the station affiliated with MyNetworkTV. KTVD is the primary preseason broadcaster of Denver Broncos football and airs 20 Nuggets and Avalanche games per year.

==History==
Channel 20 had been among the earliest television channel assignments to Denver, and two unsuccessful attempts to activate it preceded KTVD. In 1952, the Mountain States Television Company filed for the channel; while the application was pending at the Federal Communications Commission, theatrical producer and major stakeholder Irving Jacobs died of a heart attack. The permit was awarded on September 18, 1952, after which time Irving&#x27;s wife Anne also died. The remaining owners—the Sigman family, the brothers of Anne Jacobs—held off on construction in hopes that a national network could form and extend affiliation to the proposed KIRV. Ultimately, Mountain States surrendered the permit in December 1953. The second permit was granted to publishing firm Harcourt, Brace &amp; World in 1966. Harcourt, which had filed for three UHF stations in western states, later sold the permit to &quot;The Denver Post&quot;.

New interest bubbled around channel 20 beginning in the late 1970s. In 1977, Denver-based American Television &amp; Communications—the pay-television division of Time, Inc.—applied for the channel as a hybrid commercial and subscription television station. A firm headed by John H. Gayer, originally known as Family Television Inc. but later as Colorado Television Inc., applied in 1978, specifying a lineup of religious and family-oriented secular programming. The FCC took these two applications as well as those of Alden Communications of Colorado and Oak Television of Denver and designated them for comparative hearing in October 1980. American Television &amp; Communications had withdrawn by August 1983, when FCC administrative law judge Frederic J. Coufal ruled in favor of Alden&#x27;s application. He disqualified Colorado Television, finding it lacked access to a suitable transmitter site, and selected Alden over Oak owing to diversification of media ownership policy. A principal reason for the Colorado Television disqualification was the withdrawal by KWGN-TV (channel 2) of permission to set up its transmitter facility at that station&#x27; site on Lookout Mountain.

===Twenver ownership===
Alden Communications of Colorado sold the channel 20 permit—still unbuilt and then bearing the call sign KTZO-TV—to Twenver, Inc., headed by N. Richard Miller, in January 1988. After the sale to Twenver, activity accelerated. In August, the station—now KTVD—reached a five-year deal with the Denver Nuggets basketball team to air 30 road games a season. The KTVD–Nuggets contract was part of a major shakeup of the club&#x27;s television rights. They abandoned their longtime broadcaster, KWGN-TV, for a split arrangement between KTVD and KMGH-TV (channel 7), which took on 10 road games; signed a deal with Prime Sports Network, a new regional sports network, for 25 home games on cable; and assumed production duties for all telecasts.

After setbacks in construction caused channel 20 to miss telecasting some of the first games in its new deal, KTVD began broadcasting on December 1, 1988. Its backers believed Denver—the 19th-largest television market at the time—could, like other similarly sized markets, support three competing independent TV stations (KWGN-TV, KTVD, and KDVR), as the two existing independents captured less audience share than the three independents in comparable cities. The Nuggets were the anchor of a lineup that included syndicated sitcoms, classic movies, and wrestling.

KTVD&#x27;s debut into the marketplace came at a time when the Denver economy had flatlined. In 1987 and 1988, television ad revenues had posted year-over-year declines, with only minimal increases projected for the years to come. Also during this time, the Nuggets were sold to Bertram Lee and Peter Bynoe; former owner Sidney Shlenker retained the Nuggets&#x27; ownership stake in KTVD. Unlike Shlenker, who believed increased television revenue would make up for any shortfalls in attendance, the new Nuggets ownership believed it was overexposed on television, with 67 of 82 games aired in the 1989–90 season, depressing gate revenue.

By April 1990, the station was facing financial difficulties. When Prime Sports Network told its affiliates—in error—that it would carry two late-season road games in light of the station closing, it brought to the fore a payment dispute between KTVD and the Nuggets and the station&#x27;s financial struggles; the station had lost $7.5 million in 1989 on $6.2 million in gross revenue. That May, Twenver agreed to sell a majority stake in KTVD to Pennsylvania BancShares, Inc., an investment company, but BancShares did not want to advance any funding to Twenver until the FCC approved the transaction amid other disputes. This proved to be a major problem. On June 7, 1990, Chrysler Capital Corporation—a secured creditor—declared Twenver in default on its loan and drew a $1 million line of credit. On top of the station&#x27;s existing issues with cash flow problems and a large outlay on syndicated programming, this forced Twenver to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on July 11, 1990. Nine of the top twenty creditors were program distributors. Two days later, the Nuggets—owed nearly $1 million—and KTVD terminated their agreement, and before the end of the month, general manager Jack Moffitt was fired as a cost-saving move. During this time, in November 1990, channel 20 rented three hours of prime time on Election Day to KCNC-TV in a first-of-its-kind arrangement to present extended election coverage. The station experimented with local comedy; in 1992, it aired the series &quot;Denver Friday Night&quot;, similar in format to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===Newsweb ownership and UPN affiliation===
KTVD remained in bankruptcy for more than three years until the Chicago-based Newsweb Corporation acquired KTVD and paid $7.5 million to creditors, who received 25 cents on the dollar. Newsweb owned the Chicago market&#x27;s WPWR-TV, a similarly situated independent with similar programming. Newsweb held the construction permit for channel 14 in Boulder, which it sold to Roberts Broadcasting in order to acquire channel 20. Newsweb programmed the station with talk shows in prime time as a strategy to mitigate the impact of its relatively meager syndicated inventory, particularly compared to KWGN and KDVR, but an upturn in the Colorado economy increased advertising revenue as the station increased its audience share.

In 1995, KTVD debuted two new program packages. One was a network affiliation as UPN started up with channel 20 as its Denver affiliate. The other was the Colorado Avalanche, Denver&#x27;s new NHL team. In the Avs&#x27; first season, KTVD aired 19 games. The Avs, who made the playoffs in their first season, were credited with immediately boosting channel 20&#x27;s image; general manager Terry Brown noted that KTVD had better ratings in the team&#x27;s first season than KTXA did in the first season of Dallas Stars hockey. Though the team switched to a six-game over-the-air package with KMGH in 1996–97, KTVD aired playoff road games; it returned to broadcasting Avs regular-season games in 1997–98.

Owner Ascent Sports packaged Avs and Nuggets games with KPXC-TV (channel 59) for the 1998–99 season, but after one season, the package moved to KTVD. The station also experimented with local program production, including a documentary series and a weekly talk show hosted by Denver Broncos players Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith, as well as high school football telecasts. All rights to the Avalanche and Nuggets moved to Altitude Sports and Entertainment, a new team-owned regional sports network, in 2004. In 2003, KTVD took over from KWGN-TV as the over-the-air broadcaster of the Colorado Rockies, with 75 baseball games a year; Rockies games remained on channel 20 through the 2008 season, by which time telecasts had been restricted to Sunday afternoons.

Newsweb acquired KTVS (channel 3) in Sterling, Colorado, some north of Denver, from Benedek Broadcasting in 1999. The station switched to rebroadcasting KTVD.

===Duopoly with KUSA===
On December 15, 2005, Newsweb announced it would sell KTVD to Gannett, owner of Denver&#x27;s NBC affiliate, KUSA (channel 9). This would form the second duopoly within Gannett, after the First Coast News stations in Jacksonville, Florida. The agreement required adjustment when, amid final negotiations, UPN announced its merger with The WB into The CW. That network would affiliate with KWGN-TV, which had been the WB affiliate. The deal received FCC approval in June 2006 and was shortly followed by an affiliation agreement with MyNetworkTV to replace the closing UPN. Few employees moved with KTVD from its offices in Englewood to KUSA. Newsweb retained KUPN, the former KTVS, in the deal.

KTVD, along with KUSA and several other Denver stations, was among the last major-market TV stations to provide high-power digital television. The reason related to myriad siting, permitting, and other challenges that impeded construction of a new digital TV tower on Lookout Mountain for the &quot;Lake Cedar Group&quot; (KCNC, KMGH, KUSA, KTVD) until an act of Congress broke the impasse. KTVD provided high-power digital service before KUSA, by July 2008, and both stations ceased analog broadcasting on April 16, 2009.

Gannett split in two on June 29, 2015, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. KUSA and KTVD were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

==Programming==
===Newscasts===

Within months of Gannett&#x27;s acquisition, KTVD began airing local news. On September 5, 2006, coinciding with the launch of MyNetworkTV, KTVD debuted a half-hour 9 p.m. newscast from KUSA; three months later, the station added a weekday morning newscast extension from 7 to 9 a.m. The 9 p.m. newscast was expanded to a full hour in 2010.

===Sports programming===
With KUSA, KTVD shares rights to the preseason games of the Denver Broncos of the NFL. In some years—such as 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2023—KTVD carried the entire preseason schedule, then comprising four games. In 2024, of three preseason games, one was a national telecast, and the other two were split by KTVD and KUSA.

Beginning with the 2024–25 NBA season and the 2024–25 NHL season, KTVD reached an agreement with Altitude Sports and Entertainment to simulcast 20 Denver Nuggets games and 20 Colorado Avalanche games. Ten games will also be simulcast on KUSA. Altitude had previously distributed two nights of the 2019–20 Nuggets season and two nights of the 2019–20 Avalanche season in light of a near-total blackout of Altitude by pay television providers that caused ratings for the channel to drop by more than 70 percent.

<text>KDVR (channel 31) is a television station in Denver, Colorado, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is simulcast full-time over satellite station KFCT (channel 22) in Fort Collins. Nexstar Media Group owns KDVR and KFCT alongside CW station KWGN-TV (channel 2). Studios and offices are located on East Speer Boulevard in Denver&#x27;s Speer neighborhood. KDVR&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Lookout Mountain, near Golden, while KFCT&#x27;s transmitter lies atop Horsetooth Mountain just outside Fort Collins, covering Northern Colorado.

Channel 31 went on the air on August 10, 1983, as the first new commercial TV station in Denver in 30 years and the first full-service station on the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. The original permittee had intended to make channel 31 a Spanish-language station, but when census figures revealed fewer Hispanics lived in Denver than estimated, the group sold the permit. Centennial Broadcasting built the station as Denver&#x27;s second English-language independent station. KDVR affiliated with Fox at its launch in 1986 and became competitive with longtime independent KWGN-TV. The station was sold twice in the early 1990s, to Chase Broadcasting in 1989 and to Renaissance Broadcasting in 1992. These two groups obtained the permit for and built KFCT in Fort Collins in 1994.

Fox Television Stations, the owned-and-operated stations division of the Fox network, acquired KDVR in 1995 as part of a trade. It moved the station out of cramped facilities and into its present studios in 2000, allowing for the long-awaited debut of a local 9 p.m. newscast. KDVR&#x27;s news ultimately expanded into mornings and displaced KWGN-TV in the ratings. After Fox spun out KDVR and other stations to Local TV LLC in 2007, Local TV and Tribune formed a local marketing agreement in 2008 that saw the merger of the KDVR and KWGN-TV news operations in the former&#x27;s facilities; Tribune acquired KDVR outright in 2013. The station was then sold to Nexstar in 2019 as part of its acquisition of Tribune.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1977, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received two applications to build new television stations in Denver. One came from a subsidiary of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, while the other was filed by La Unidad Broadcasting Corporation, headed by Denver broadcaster George Sandoval. While the commission adjudicated the applications, channel 31 in Denver made television history in February 1980 as the first ever satellite-fed translator with a direct program source, KA2XEG (also known as K31AA), was launched by the Spanish International Network.

On February 24, 1981, the FCC granted the construction permit to La Unidad Broadcasting. Two months later, however, their plans for a Spanish-language television station would prove unviable. The 1980 United States Census reported that 92,000 Hispanics lived in the Denver city limits. While Sandoval suspected that was an undercount of what he estimated were 125,000 Hispanics, the reliance of advertisers and other groups on census figures convinced the company that there was no market at the time for a Spanish-language station in Denver. As a result, La Unidad opted to pivot its plans for what was originally designated KTMX-TV. In late 1981, it sold 80 percent of the construction permit to Centennial Broadcasting Corporation, a subsidiary of Camellia City Telecasters and majority-owned by Business Men&#x27;s Assurance Company (BMA) of Kansas City, Missouri (with Sandoval staying as manager). The reorganized ownership shifted its plan to operate a full-service English-language independent station incorporating programming for Hispanics in Denver. At that time, work was already underway on constructing a new tower atop Lookout Mountain and remodeling the former studios of KWGN-TV at 550 Lincoln Street.

Construction stretched into 1983, intermittently affected by weather at the transmitter site, and the station began broadcasting on August 10—23 days late due to technical issues. It was the first new commercial station in Denver since KBTV (channel 9) debuted in 1953 and offered a mix of syndicated reruns and movies. Centennial spent $7 million on the station&#x27;s facilities. The station also joined a consortium of Spanish-language TV stations outside of the Spanish International Network for advertising sales in Spanish. Camellia City Telecasters launched a third independent station in October 1983, KPDX serving the Portland, Oregon, market. It then sued Tribune Broadcasting and Chris-Craft Industries, alleging that the two groups (which owned KWGN-TV in Denver and KPTV in Portland, their two independents&#x27; chief competition) had pooled their buying power and denied Camellia City the ability to bid on syndicated shows for their stations.

KDVR became a charter affiliate of Fox at its launch in October 1986. Fox programming helped the station charge higher advertising rates to close the gap with KWGN; from sign-on to sign-off, by February 1990, channel 31&#x27;s ratings were only slightly behind those of channel 2.

===Chase and Renaissance ownership===
BMA put its Denver and Sacramento television stations on the market in October 1988. It was the second time the company had done so; in 1985, all three had been on the market and attracted bids from such major players as Taft Broadcasting and Gaylord Broadcasting, but the startup KDVR and KPDX weighed down the value of the highly profitable KTXL. While a buyer was found for KTXL in December 1988, KDVR was sold to Chase Communications of Hartford, Connecticut, in March 1989 as the company&#x27;s third television station. The sale announcement came days before founder Sandoval was killed in a car accident at the age of 57; when KDVR moved from 550 Lincoln to a building at 5th and Wazee streets later that year, it was dedicated in his honor. The former studio building was then demolished three years later. The new facility, however, soon proved inadequate for the station&#x27;s long-term goals. It was cramped, isolated, and suffered from cellular interference issues.

Chase closed on its purchase of KDVR in March 1990. Between Hartford&#x27;s WTIC-TV, KDVR, its acquisition of two stations owned by Outlet Communications, and the affiliation of Chase-owned WPTY-TV in Memphis, Tennessee, with Fox, the group grew to five Fox affiliates by that July. In 1991, Chase Broadcasting announced it would sell some or all of its properties to invest in new business ventures in Eastern Europe after the end of the Cold War, particularly successful cable television systems in Poland. The next year, it sold four of the five Fox affiliates, including KDVR, to Renaissance Broadcasting of Greenwich, Connecticut.

Chase was approved by the FCC in 1992 for a construction permit to build channel 22 in Fort Collins (located north of Denver) as a satellite of KDVR. In November 1994, the station signed on the air as KFCT, expanding coverage to parts of northern Colorado and far southern Wyoming.

===Fox Television Stations ownership===
Renaissance sold KDVR and KFCT to Fox Television Stations for $70 million on November 15, 1994, in exchange for acquiring that network&#x27;s owned-and-operated station in Dallas–Fort Worth, KDAF. Fox was selling KDAF because it was moving its programming to the previous CBS affiliate, KDFW, as a result of a ten-station affiliation deal with New World Communications. Fox was highly interested in the Denver market. Previous rumors had tied the network to a trade with Tribune of KDAF for KWGN-TV or with relocating the Fox affiliation to KWGN-TV or one of Denver&#x27;s network affiliates, though the market&#x27;s ABC, CBS, and NBC affiliates instead exchanged affiliations among themselves.

As part of a series of attempts to prevent News Corporation, the parent company of Fox, from acquiring additional stations, NBC filed a request to the FCC to reject the trade alleging that the company was in violation of foreign ownership rules (which prohibit a foreign-owned company from maintaining more than a 25 percent interest in a U.S. television station). Foreign ownership had been a sensitive issue for Fox even prior to the New World deal. In 1993, its attempt to acquire WGBS-TV in Philadelphia was derailed after the NAACP objected on ownership grounds. In the wake of the objection, the FCC opened a foreign ownership review into Murdoch&#x27;s existing station holdings; had it ruled negatively, a forced ownership change or license loss could have meant the end of the network.

In July 1995, when the FCC granted Fox approval to buy KDVR and two additional stations in Boston and Memphis, the foreign-ownership issue was resolved, removing a roadblock to purchases by the company. Even then, Fox&#x27;s desire for a lower channel number in Denver was the subject of rumors; one October 1995 article in &quot;Variety&quot; suggested that Fox wanted to sell KDVR to Qwest Broadcasting, a company backed by Quincy Jones and Tribune, and move its affiliation to KWGN-TV, leaving KDVR with The WB. That possibility was floated again in July 1996. A February 1997 article in &quot;Mediaweek&quot; floated that KDVR could have been part of a trade with Belo Corporation to acquire a station in Seattle.

Fox desired to begin airing local news programming, but it lacked the space to do so. On February 21, 1998, the company announced it would build a facility on the corner of Speer and Lincoln—the site from which KWGN-TV and KDVR had each started broadcasting, 30 years apart. This would be the third building overhaul project in the Fox Television Stations group in three years, following previous builds for KTTV in Los Angeles and KRIV in Houston. Once the building was complete, the station would add 60 employees and launch a 9 p.m. newscast. Ground was broken in April 1998, and the first KDVR newscast aired on July 16, 2000.

===Local TV and Tribune ownership===
On December 22, 2007, Fox Television Stations agreed to sell KDVR and seven other Fox owned-and-operated stations to Local TV LLC, a holding company operated by private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners), adding to the nine stations that the group had acquired that May from The New York Times Company. The sale was finalized on July 14, 2008. On September 17, Tribune Broadcasting announced that Local TV would begin managing KWGN-TV under a local marketing agreement and consolidate its operations with KDVR effective October 1. It was one of two markets where Local TV-owned Fox stations and Tribune-owned CW affiliates would share resources, alongside KTVI–KPLR-TV in St. Louis, and built on an existing management relationship between the companies. KWGN vacated its longtime studios in Greenwood Village and consolidated its operations with KDVR at its Speer Boulevard facility. Tribune bought KDVR outright in 2013 as part of its $2.75 billion acquisition of Local TV LLC.

Tribune sold the KDVR–KWGN studio to Urban Renaissance Group, a real estate firm from Seattle, in 2017, continuing to lease it back under a long-term agreement.

===Sinclair purchase attempt; sale to Nexstar===
In May 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media. KDVR was then identified as one of 23 stations that Sinclair would divest to obtain regulatory approval for the merger, with Fox Television Stations agreeing to a repurchase as part of a $910 million deal. Both transactions were nullified on August 9, 2018, following Tribune Media&#x27;s termination of the merger agreement and FCC chairman Ajit Pai&#x27;s public rejection of the deal.

Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal closed on September 19, 2019.

==Local programming==
===News operation===
Rumors of a local newscast for KDVR first surfaced under Renaissance ownership in 1994. This continued after Fox took ownership of channel 31, but the primary obstacle was a lack of room. KDVR&#x27;s Wazee Street building was in size, and Fox believed it needed to start a newscast. Upon announcing the construction of the News and Technology Center, with of space, Fox also announced it would begin producing local news in Denver when the building opened; general manager Robert M. Simone promised that &quot;local news done &#x27;Fox-style&#x27; will further bond KDVR to the community&quot;.

The first step in organizing the news department was made by Fox in September 1999, when a news director was hired. More hires were made in the final weeks of 1999 and first months of 2000, including consumer reporter Tom Martino; David Treadwell, former Denver Broncos kicker, to anchor sports; news anchors Libby Weaver, former co-host of the syndicated entertainment news program &quot;Extra&quot;, and Ron Zappolo, former KCNC and KUSA sports anchor crossing over to news; and former KUSA reporter Phil Keating.

After the Technology Center opened, rehearsals began in May, and the hour-long &quot;Fox 31 News at 9 O&#x27;Clock&quot; debuted on July 16, 2000. With Fox&#x27;s successful Sunday night lineup, the main news anchors appeared on a Sunday–Thursday shift instead of a more typical Monday–Friday schedule. Out of the gate, the 9 p.m. newscast was a strong ratings performer, outrating the established 9 p.m. newscast on KWGN-TV as well as the entertainment programming KDVR had aired in that hour. In July 2001, a year after starting up, KDVR was beating ABC affiliate KMGH-TV, the traditional third-rated station, in the ratings, even though their newscasts aired at different times. While KWGN-TV remained competitive, logging a head-to-head win in November 2002, KDVR gradually pulled away from its competitor.

KDVR expanded news programming to mornings on March 22, 2004, with the debut of &quot;Good Day Colorado&quot;, which was created to compete with KWGN&#x27;s weekday morning newscast, &quot;WB2 Morning News&quot;. The new morning show was promoted with a custom song performed by Denver singer Wendy Woo. &quot;Good Day Colorado&quot; was initially a 2½-hour newscast beginning at 5:30 a.m. but expanded to four hours (5–9 a.m.) by May 2006, when founding news director Bill Dallman departed. The station&#x27;s first weeknight early evening newscast debuted in August 2008.

After entering into the local marketing agreement, major changes were made to KDVR and KWGN&#x27;s evening news programming that reduced overlap between the stations. KWGN discontinued its 5:30 p.m. newscast on January 12, 2009, while KDVR expanded its early evening newscast to an hour at 5 p.m. On March 30, KWGN moved its prime time newscast two hours earlier to 7 p.m., making the unusual move of airing The CW programming from 8–10 p.m. with the network&#x27;s blessing. 

News expansions continued in the 2010s. On June 28, 2010, KDVR added a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast titled &quot;Fox 31 Nightside&quot;, which focused on hard-hitting enterprise stories. In 2016, KDVR began airing an 11 a.m. news hour and a 4:30 a.m. extension to &quot;Good Day Colorado&quot;. During this time, some of the station&#x27;s original news personalities departed. Zappolo and Weaver continued to anchor KDVR&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast until the latter left in 2012; Zappolo left months later. Martino, who worked at KHOW radio concurrent with his time at KDVR, was dismissed in 2011 after he announced he was filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; he sued the station alleging discrimination, a matter which was settled in 2014.

On January 9, 2024, approximately 75 part- and full-time employees of KDVR and KWGN voted to unionize with NABET-CWA, including production technicians, newsroom staff, and workers at a master control hub for multiple Nexstar-owned stations also based at the KDVR facilities. Employees cited a lack of pay equity and transparency as the basis for their vote; in particular, salaries for part-time production staff started at $17.29 per hour, slightly above the state minimum wage of $14.42 per hour.

===Sports programming===
On August 7, 2014, KDVR entered into a partnership with the Denver Broncos to broadcast the team&#x27;s weekly coaches show, &quot;Broncos Zone&quot;, which was known as &quot;Fox on Fox&quot; when John Fox was the head coach; it airs during the season on Friday evenings, replacing half of the 9 p.m. newscast, and is hosted by sports director Nick Griffith.

===Other programming===
From 2009 to 2010, KDVR aired &quot;Everyday with Libby and Natalie&quot;, a daytime lifestyle program hosted by Libby Weaver and reporter Natalie Tysdal. The program performed poorly in the ratings and was shifted to KWGN-TV in 2010.

On June 1, 2014, KDVR debuted &quot;#COpolitics – From the Source&quot;, an unconventionally formatted Sunday morning political discussion program that was taped at The Source food market in Denver. It ended when host Eli Stokols left KDVR–KWGN after a decade for &quot;Politico&quot; the next year.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:

In December 2020, KWGN-TV began broadcasting in ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) format. At that time, KWGN-TV&#x27;s main signal was moved to the KDVR-KFCT multiplex.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KDVR shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 31, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 32, using virtual channel 31. The station was then repacked to channel 36 in 2020.

===Translators===
In addition to KFCT, KDVR is relayed on the following translator stations:
* Anton: K15MH-D
* Basalt: K33HY-D
* Haxtun: K33GM-D
* Holyoke: K29GI-D
* Idalia: K14LB-D

<text>The Anti-Saloon League, now known as the American Council on Addiction and Alcohol Problems, is an organization of the temperance movement in the United States.

Founded in 1893 in Oberlin, Ohio, it was a key component of the Progressive Era, and was strongest in the South and rural North, drawing support from Protestant ministers and their congregations, especially Methodists, Baptists, Disciples and Congregationalists. It concentrated on legislation, and cared about how legislators had voted, not whether they drank or not. Established initially as an Ohio state society, its influence spread rapidly. In 1895, it became a national organization and quickly rose to become the most powerful prohibition lobby in America, overshadowing the older Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party. Its triumph was nationwide prohibition locked into the Constitution with passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919. It was decisively defeated when Prohibition was repealed in 1933.

However, the organization continued – albeit with multiple name changes – and as of 2016, is known as the American Council on Addiction and Alcohol Problems. It remains active in lobbying to restrict alcohol advertising and promoting temperance. Its periodical is titled &quot;The American Issue&quot;. Member organizations of the American Council on Addiction and Alcohol Problems include &quot;state temperance organizations, national Christian denominations and other fraternal organizations that support ACAAP&#x27;s philosophy of abstinence&quot;.

== Organizational structure and operation ==

The League was the first modern pressure group in the United States organized around one issue. Unlike earlier popular movements, it utilized bureaucratic methods learned from business to build a strong organization. The League&#x27;s founder and first leader, Howard Hyde Russell (1855–1946), believed that the best leadership was selected, not elected. Russell built from the bottom up, shaping local leagues and raising the most promising young men to leadership at the local and state levels. This organizational strategy reinvigorated the temperance movement. Publicity for the League was handled by Edward Young Clarke and Mary Elizabeth Tyler of the Southern Publicity Association.

In 1909, the League moved its national headquarters from Washington to Westerville, Ohio, which had a reputation for supporting temperance. The American Issue Publishing House, the publishing arm of the League, was also in Westerville. Ernest Cherrington headed the company. It printed so many leaflets – over 40 tons of mail per month – that Westerville was the smallest town to have a first class post office.

From 1948 until 1950 the group was named the Temperance League, from 1950 to 1964 the National Temperance League, and from 1964 to 2015 the American Council on Alcohol Problems (ACAP); in 2016 the group rebranded as the American Council on Addiction and Alcohol Problems (ACAAP). the organization continues its &quot;neo-prohibitionist agenda&quot;, with the addition of &quot;other drugs&quot; such as opioids. ACAAP is headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama.

A museum about the Anti-Saloon League is at the Westerville Public Library.

==Pressure politics==
The League&#x27;s most prominent leader was Wayne Wheeler, although both Ernest Cherrington and William E. &quot;Pussyfoot&quot; Johnson were also highly influential and powerful. The League used pressure politics in legislative politics, which it is credited with developing.

Howard Ball has written that the Ku Klux Klan and the Anti-Saloon league were both immensely powerful pressure groups in Birmingham, Alabama during the Post-World War I period. A local newspaper editor at the time wrote that &quot;In Alabama, it is hard to tell where the Anti-Saloon League ends and the Klan begins&quot;. During the May 1928 primary in Alabama, the League joined with Klansmen and members of the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). When an Alabama state senator proposed an anti-masking statute &quot;to emasculate the order&#x27;s ability to terrorize people&quot;, lobbying led by J. Bib Mills, the superintendent of the Alabama Anti-Saloon League, ensured that the bill failed.

When it came to fighting “wet” candidates, especially candidates such as Al Smith in the presidential election of 1928, the League was less effective because its audience was already Republican.

==National constitutional amendment==
The League used a multitiered approach in its attempts to secure a dry (prohibition) nation through national legislation and congressional hearings, the Scientific Temperance Federation, and its American Issue Publishing Company. The League also used emotion based on patriotism, efficiency and anti-German sentiment in World War I. The activists saw themselves as preachers fulfilling their religious duty of eliminating liquor in America. As it tried to mobilize public opinion in favor of a dry, saloonless nation, the League invented many of the modern techniques of public relations.

==Local work==
The League lobbied at all levels of government for legislation to prohibit the manufacture or import of spirits, beer and wine. Ministers had launched several efforts to close Arizona saloons after the 1906 creation of League chapters in Yuma, Tucson, and Phoenix. A League organizer from New York arrived in 1909, but the Phoenix chapter was stymied by local-option elections, whereby local areas could decide whether to allow saloons. League members pressured local police to take licenses from establishments that violated closing hours or served women and minors, and they provided witnesses to testify about these violations. One witness was Frank Shindelbower, a juvenile from a poor family, who testified that several saloons had sold him liquor; as a result those saloons lost their licenses. However, owners discovered that Shindelbower had perjured himself, and he was imprisoned. After the &quot;Arizona Gazette&quot; and other newspapers pictured Shindelbower as the innocent tool of the Anti-Saloon League, he was pardoned.

==State operations==
At the state level, the League had mixed results, usually doing best in rural and Southern states. It made little headway in larger cities, or among liturgical church members such as Catholics, Jews, Episcopalians and German Lutherans. Pegram (1990) explains its success in Illinois under William Hamilton Anderson. From 1900 and 1905, the League worked to obtain a local option referendum law and became an official church federation. Local Option was passed in 1907 and, by 1910, 40 of Illinois&#x27;s 102 counties and 1,059 of the state&#x27;s townships and precincts had become dry, including some Protestant areas around Chicago. Despite these successes, after the Prohibition amendment was ratified in 1919, social problems ignored by the League – such as organized crime – undermined the public influence of the single-issue pressure group, and it faded in importance. Pegram (1997) uses the League&#x27;s failure in Maryland to explore the relationship between Southern Progressivism and national progressivism. William H. Anderson was the League&#x27;s Maryland leader from 1907 to 1914, but he was unable to adapt to local conditions, such as the large German element. The League failed to ally with local political bosses and attacked the Democratic Party. In Maryland, as in the rest of the South, Pegram concludes, traditional religious, political, and racial concerns constrained reform movements even as they converted Southerners to the new national politics of federal intervention and interest-group competition.

William M. Forgrave was superintendent of the Massachusetts Anti-Saloon League from 1923 to 1928. In his first year as leader, the statewide referendum on the state&#x27;s liquor enforcement code was passed by a majority of 8,000 votes. The same referendum had been defeated by 103,000 votes two years earlier. In 1928, the Massachusetts House of Representatives voted 97 to 93 to censure him and strip him of his right to act as a legislative agent after he made unsubstantiated allegations the Massachusetts General Court held a &quot;wild party&quot; and gave away liquor confiscated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety. The Senate rejected the amendment because Forgrave had censured without a hearing. He resigned as superintendent on November 27, 1928, due to his impending divorce.

==Post-1928==
Unable to cope with the failures of prohibition after 1928, especially bootlegging and organized crime as well as reduced government revenue, the League failed to counter the repeal forces. Led by prominent Democrats, Franklin D. Roosevelt handily won the U.S. presidency election in 1932 on a wet platform. A new Constitutional amendment passed in 1933 to repeal the 18th Amendment, and the League lost much of its former influence afterwards.

As of 2016, the organization is now known as the American Council on Addiction and Alcohol Problems and remains active in lobbying to restrict alcohol advertising and promoting temperance. It additionally aims to reduce alcohol consumption by Americans. Member organizations of the American Council on Addiction and Alcohol Problems include &quot;state temperance organizations, national Christian denominations and other fraternal organizations that support ACAAP&#x27;s philosophy of abstinence&quot;.

<text>GSC 02652-01324 is an orange dwarf main sequence star approximately 521 light-years away in the constellation of Lyra (the Lyre).

==Planetary system==
In 2004 the extrasolar planet TrES-1b was found to be orbiting this star by the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey using the transit method. The planet was detected crossing its parent star using a small telescope. The discovery was confirmed by the Keck Observatory using the radial velocity method, allowing its mass to be determined.

Additional planets in the systems are suspected due to transit timing variations of TrES-1b.

William Collins was born at Eastwood, Renfrewshire, on 12 October 1789. He was a millworker who established a company in 1819 for printing and publishing. The business eventually published pamphlets, sermons, hymn books and prayer books as well as a wide range of office products. By 1824 he had produced the company&#x27;s first dictionary, the &quot;Greek and English Lexicon&quot;. He was instrumental in bringing Thomas Chalmers from Kilmany to Glasgow. He also obtained a licence to publish the Bible in the 1840s. He was promoter of Scotland&#x27;s first temperance movement. He founded the Glasgow Church Building Society which created 20 new churches. He died on 2 January 1853 at Rothesay, Buteshire.

At the age of twenty-five Mr Collins was ordained an elder in the congregation of the Tron Church, Glasgow, then under the pastoral care of Dr M&#x27;Gill. In the course of his reading he happened to peruse the article on the Evidences of Christianity in the Encydopcedia Britannica. The freshness of its intellectual power, and the glow of its moral and evangelical enthusiasm, impressed and delighted him. Accordingly, when Dr M&#x27;Gill died, Mr Collins turned his eyes to the author of the article which had so fascinated him, the Rev. Thomas Chalmers, as a suitable successor to Dr M&#x27;Gill, and greatly aided in the movement which resulted in the appointment by the Town Council of the young minister of Kilmany to the church and parish of the Tron. From no one did Dr Chalmers receive a heartier welcome on his induction in 1815 than from the youngest member of his session, Mr Collins.

==Work with Thomas Chalmers==
When Dr Chalmers originated the idea of local Sabbath Schools, Mr Collins opened the first school. Chalmers was next transferred to the new parish of St John&#x27;s. Mr Collins accompanied his minister to his new charge, and still kept his place by his side. To Dr Chalmers, with his keen political and social insight, it belonged to originate methods of civic and Christian economy, and to expound and recommend them. But his elder, quiet and unobtrusive, came after him, testing the ideas of his chief, and giving them practical realization in the hovels of the poor.

==Collins and the slave trade==
Collins advocated for the abolition of African slavery, at a time when that cause was not so popular as it came to be at a later date. This brought him into contact and co-operation with William Wilberforce, Zachary Macaulay, and other champions of the emancipation of the slave. The fact that he took openly the side of the slaves, and that petitions for emancipation lay in his book shop, alienated some of his business customers, many of whom were largely interested in the West India trade.

==Publishing of religious works==
Mr Collins, published religious literature by reprinting, in a more accessible form many of the writings of the divines of the sixteenth and seventeenth century. To these volumes suitable introductions were prefixed, written by the more eminent clergymen and laymen of the day, of all denominations.

==Involvement in the temperance movement==
When the temperance cause found its way to Scotland from the United States in 1829, Mr Collins hailed it, as &quot;throwing a ray of light,&quot; to use his own words, upon a dark problem. He was the earliest member of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Temperance Society, and he laboured to promote its object. He visited, on this errand, many of the towns of Scotland, and even extended his tours to Manchester, Liverpool, and London, in all which places he delivered addresses to large audiences. He visited the metropolis three times, and succeeded, on his third visit, in forming the British and Foreign Temperance Society. At one of its early meetings in Exeter Hall he delivered his famous lecture on the &quot;Harmony of the Gospel and Temperance Societies&quot;. From 1829 to 1834 a large portion of his time and means were devoted to the maintenance of a cause which he regarded as very important.

==Glaswegian church building scheme==

After talking with his daughter Collins conceived of his grand enterprise of aiming to provide twenty additional parish churches for Glasgow. Many pronounced his scheme a &quot;devout imagination;&quot; but the very greatness of the enterprise contributed largely to its success. Christian philanthropy in those days found vent in contributions of one guinea, five guineas, and, on very extraordinary occasions, ten guineas. Here was an appeal to Christian men to unite in achieving a great object of an evangelical kind by contributions of £200 each, payable in five instalments. This was a novelty; but a novelty that first astounded and next attracted men. The originator, they saw, was in earnest. He had given proof of this by subscribing at once his own quota, from, as was known, very slender means. His example stimulated the liberality of those whose incomes were five, ten, twenty fold that of the propounder of the scheme, and the result was that in a few months Mr Collins had obtained, mainly by his own exertions, the sum of; £22,000; and only eight years after he had first mooted his proposal before an incredulous public, he had the happiness of consummating his enterprise by laying the foundation stone of the twentieth church erected under the auspices of the Glasgow Church Building Society. Of these churches, not fewer than thirteen or fourteen had the name of William Collins graven on their foundation stone.

==National church building scheme==
The work was taken up by Dr Chalmers, who resolved on doing for Scotland what Collins had done for Glasgow. A Government Commission was appointed to inquire into the matter. Elaborate statistics of the spiritual destitution of Glasgow were given in by Mr Collins to that Commission. These were not without important results. Copies were sent to all the dignitaries of the Church of England, and the result of their circulation among the English bishops and clergy, was the formation of church building societies in at least two of the dioceses of the sister kingdom. The metropolis of England did not deem it beneath it to follow in the wake of Presbyterian Glasgow, nor its metropolitan pastor to copy the example of the elder of the Tron.

==Post Disruption church building==
In the labours of the busy years following the Disruption to provide churches, manses, and schools for the congregations of the Free Church, he took part, according to the measure of his strength. He laid the foundation stone of the new Church erected for the congregation of Free St John&#x27;s, then under the pastoral care of Dr Thomas Brown. He also laid the foundation stone of the Free Tron, of which Dr Robert Buchanan was minister; and now he connected himself once more with the session of that congregation. He had left it twenty-one years before; he now returned and acted as an elder in it till he died.

==Last days==
In 1848, with failing health he relocated to Rothesay. There he took an active part in the establishing of a missionary station in the most destitute part of that town. On Sabbath, 2 January 1853, Mr Collins died.

==Family==

His son Sir William Collins served as Lord Provost of Glasgow.

==Artistic portrayal==

He was portrayed by William Wallace.

<text>KCEC (channel 14) is a television station licensed to Boulder, Colorado, United States, broadcasting the Spanish-language Univision network to the Denver area. Owned by TelevisaUnivision, it is operated under a local marketing agreement (LMA) by Entravision Communications as a sister station to UniMás affiliate KTFD-TV (channel 50). The two stations share studios on Mile High Stadium West Circle in Jefferson Park, Denver; KCEC&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Morrison in western Jefferson County.

[[KVSN-DT]] (channel 48) in Pueblo operates as a semi-satellite of KCEC, expanding the Univision signal into South-Central Colorado. As such, it simulcasts all Univision programming as provided through its parent, and the two stations share a website. However, KVSN airs separate commercial inserts and legal identifications. Local newscasts, produced by KCEC and branded as &quot;Noticias Univision Colorado&quot;, are simulcast on both stations. KVSN does not maintain any facilities in Pueblo or Colorado Springs; master control and internal operations are based at KCEC&#x27;s studios.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on February 22, 1996, as KTVJ. Founded by Roberts Broadcasting, it originally aired programming from the Home Shopping Network. In January 2003, Roberts sold the station to Univision Communications. Two months later on March 10, 2003, the station changed its call sign to KTFD-TV (which was modified to KTFD-DT on June 23, 2009, in correspondence with the callsign modifications to the &quot;-DT&quot; suffix applied by all Univision-owned stations following the digital television transition), and became an owned-and-operated station of Univision&#x27;s secondary network TeleFutura.

===2017 license and channel swap===
On December 4, 2017, as part of a multi-market realignment, the programming and call signs of KTFD and sister station KCEC were swapped: KTFD and its UniMás programming moved to the Entravision-owned facility using digital channel 26 and virtual channel 50, while Univision&#x27;s digital channel 15 and virtual channel 14 facility became the new home of KCEC.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KCEC (as KTFD-TV) shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 14, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 15, using virtual channel 14.

On April 29, 2020, KCEC completed the migration from digital channel 15 to channel 32 as part of the FCC spectrum auction repack.

===Former translator===
KTFD&#x27;s signal was formerly relayed on low-power analog translator station KDVT-LP (channel 36) in Denver, which was owned by Entravision Communications. The translator was never converted to digital, and its license was canceled on September 13, 2017.

Two more seats were apportioned following the 1820 census.

=== 1843–1863: 4 seats ===
A fourth seat was added following the 1840 census.

=== 1863–1873: 5 seats ===
A fifth seat was added following the 1860 census. However, the Civil War prevented them from being seated until July 18, 1868.

=== 1873–1903: 6 seats ===
A sixth seat was added following the 1870 census. From 1873 to 1875, that extra seat was elected at-large statewide. Starting in 1875, however, the state was redistricted into six districts.

A seventh seat was added following the 1900 census.

=== 1913–1993: 8 seats ===
After the 1910 census, Louisiana&#x27;s delegation reached its largest size, eight seats, which it held for 80 years.


=== 1993–2013: 7 seats ===
After the 1990 census, Louisiana lost one seat.

=== 2013–present: 6 seats ===
After the 2010 census, Louisiana lost one seat due to stagnant population growth and the loss of citizens who left the state after Hurricane Katrina and did not return.

<text>TrES-1b is an extrasolar planet approximately 523 light-years away in the constellation of Lyra (the Lyre). The planet&#x27;s mass and radius indicate that it is a Jovian planet with a similar bulk composition to Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter, but similar to many other planets detected around other stars, TrES-1 is located very close to its star, and belongs to the class of planets known as hot Jupiters. The planet was discovered orbiting around GSC 02652-01324 (an orange dwarf star).

==Detection and discovery==
TrES-1b was discovered by the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey by detecting the transit of the planet across its parent star using a telescope. The discovery was confirmed by the Keck Observatory using the radial velocity method, which allowed its mass to be determined.

===Transit===
On March 22, 2005, Astronomers using NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope took advantage of this fact to directly capture the infrared light of two previously detected planets orbiting outside our solar system. Their findings revealed the temperatures and orbits of the planets.

Upcoming &quot;Spitzer&quot; observations using a variety of infrared wavelengths may provide more information about the planets&#x27; winds and atmospheric compositions. It enabled determination of TrES-1&#x27;s temperature, which is in excess of 1000 K (1340 °F). The planet&#x27;s Bond albedo was found to be 0.31 ± 0.14.

In the infrared panel, the colors reflect what our eyes might see if we could retune them to the invisible, infrared portion of the light spectrum. The hot star is less bright in infrared light than in visible and appears fainter. The warm planet peaks in infrared light, so is shown brighter. Their hues represent relative differences in temperature. Because the star is hotter than the planet, and because hotter objects give off more blue light than red, the star is depicted in blue, and the planet, red.

The overall look of the planet is inspired by theoretical models of hot, gas giant planets. These &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; are similar to Jupiter in composition and mass, but are expected to look quite different at such high temperatures.

===Radial velocity===
The transit light-curve signature in the course of the TrES multi-site transiting planet survey, and confirmed the planetary nature of the companion via multicolor photometry and precise radial velocity measurements. With this, the planet has an orbital period similar to that of HD 209458 b, but about twice as long as those of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) transiting planets. Its mass is similar to that of HD 209458 b, but its radius is significantly smaller and fits the theoretical models without the need for an additional source of heat deep in the atmosphere, as has been invoked by some investigators for HD 209458 b.

==Rotation==
The spin-orbit angle using the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect was measured to be +30° in 2007, and measurement was not updated by 2012

==Physical characteristics==
Hubble might find water in TrES-1, and it would give a much more precise measurement of the planet&#x27;s size, and even allow us to search for moons. A satellite is unlikely however, given the likely history and current orbital configuration for the planet, the research team concluded.

There are only 11 exomoon candidates around 8 exoplanets, but some researchers have considered that such satellites would be logical places for life to exist around giant gaseous worlds that otherwise could not be expected to support biology.

Models indicate that TrES-1 has undergone significant tidal heating in the past due to its eccentric orbit, but this does not appear to have inflated the planet&#x27;s radius.

<doc id="948686" wikidata="Q1348006" url="?curid=948686" title="City block">
<text>A city block, residential block, urban block, or simply block is a central element of urban planning and urban design.

In a city with a grid system, the block is the smallest group of buildings that is surrounded by streets. City blocks are the space for buildings within the street pattern of a city, and form the basic unit of a city&#x27;s urban fabric. City blocks may be subdivided into any number of smaller land lots usually in private ownership, though in some cases, it may be other forms of tenure. City blocks are usually built-up to varying degrees and thus form the physical containers, or &quot;streetwalls,&quot; of public spaces. Most cities are composed of a greater or lesser variety of sizes and shapes of an urban block. For example, many pre-industrial cores of cities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East tend to have irregularly shaped street patterns and urban blocks, while cities based on grids have much more regular arrangements.

By extension, the word &quot;block&quot; is an important informal unit of length equal to the distance between two streets of a street grid.

==Grid plan==

In most cities of the New World that were planned rather than developing gradually over a long period of time, streets are typically laid out on a grid plan of square or rectangular city blocks. Using the perimeter block development principle, city blocks are developed so that buildings are located along the perimeter of the block, with entrances facing the street, and semi-private courtyards in the rear of the buildings. This historic arrangement reflects organic development of structures and land usage, adapted to urban planning.

Since the spacing of streets in grid plans varies so widely among cities, or even within cities, it is difficult to generalize about the size of a city block. Oblong blocks range considerably in width and length. The standard block in Manhattan is about . In Chicago, a typical city block is , meaning that 16 east-west blocks or 8 north-south blocks measure one mile, which has been adopted by other US cities. In much of the United States and Canada, the addresses follow a block and lot number system, in which each block of a street is allotted 100 building numbers. The blocks in central Melbourne, Australia, are also , formed by splitting the square blocks in an original grid with a narrow street down the middle.

Many Old World cities have grown by accretion over time rather than being planned, making rectangular city blocks uncommon in the innermost development among most European cities, for example. Exceptions include cities that were founded as Roman military settlements, often preserving the original grid layout around two main orthogonal axes (such as Turin, Italy); and cities heavily damaged during World War II (like Frankfurt). Following the example of Philadelphia, New York City adopted the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 for a more extensive grid plan.

==Structure variations==
Some variations of the interpretation of city blocks include superblocks, subblocks, and perimeter blocks.

===Superblock===
A superblock, or super-block, is an area of urban land that is bounded by arterial roads and the size of multiple typically sized city blocks. Within the superblock, the local road network, if any, is designed to serve only local needs.

Superblocks can also contain an orthogonal internal road network, including those based on a grid plan or quasi-grid plan. That typology is prevalent in Japan and China, for example. Chen defines the supergrid and superblock urban morphology in that context as follows:&quot;The Supergrid is a large-scale net of wide roads that defines a series of cells or Superblocks, each containing a network of narrower streets.&quot;Superblocks can also be retroactively superimposed on pre-existing grid plan by changing the traffic rules and streetscape of internal streets within the superblock, as in the case of Barcelona&#x27;s &quot;superilles&quot; (Catalan for superblocks). Each &quot;superilla&quot; has nine city blocks, with speed limits on the internal roads slowed to , through traffic disallowed, and through travel possible only on the perimeter roads.

===Sub-structure===
In a geoprocessing perspective there are two complementary ways of modeling city blocks:
* &quot;with sidewalks&quot;: using a direct geometric representation of the usual concept of city blocks. Not only sidewalks, but also inner alleys, common gardens, etc. Some street parts, such as a street greenway, isolated and with no related lot, can be also represented as a &quot;block without sidewalks&quot;.
* &quot;without sidewalks&quot;: represented by polygon obtained by the external border of the union of a set of touching land lots (illustration opposite).

A &quot;block without sidewalks&quot; is always within a &quot;block with sidewalks&quot;. The geometric subtraction of a &quot;block without sidewalks&quot; from &quot;block with sidewalks&quot;, contains the sidewalk, the alley, and any other non-lot sub-structure.

===Perimeter block===

A perimeter block is a type of city block which is built up on all sides surrounding a central space that is semi-private. They may contain a mixture of uses, with commercial or retail functions on the ground floor. Perimeter blocks are a key component of many European cities and are an urban form that allows very high urban densities to be achieved without high-rise buildings.

==Use of term==
===As an informal unit of distance===
In North American English and Australian English, the word &quot;block&quot; is used as an informal unit of distance. For example, someone giving directions might say, &quot;It&#x27;s three blocks from here&quot;, meaning either literally three blocks distant (in a city grid) or the equivalent of three blocks without a grid.

Since there is no standard dimension for city blocks, and they are typically rectangular in shape, meaning a block in one direction is a different length than a block in another, colloquial directions involving blocks as proxies for measurements in feet or meters can be both imprecise and relative.

<text>The Diocese of Mainz, () historically known in English as Mentz as well as by its French name Mayence, is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in Germany. It was founded in 304, promoted in 780 to Metropolitan Archbishopric of Mainz and demoted back in 1802 to bishopric. The diocese is suffragan diocese in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Freiburg. Its district is located in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse. The seat of the diocese is in Mainz at the Cathedral dedicated to Saints Martin and Stephen.

== History ==
* Established in 340 as Diocese of Mainz
* Gained territory in 755 from the suppressed Diocese of Erfurt
* Promoted in 780 as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Mainz
* Demoted (back) on the 29th of November, 1801 to Diocese of Mainz (gained territory from Diocese of Metz, Diocese of Speyer, Metropolitan Archdiocese of Trier and Diocese of Worms)
* Lost territories repeatedly; in April 1818 to Diocese of Konstanz, Diocese of Speyer and Diocese of Wurzburg; in July 1821 to Diocese of Paderborn; in August 1821 to Diocese of Fulda and to establish Diocese of Limburg, and exchanged territory with Diocese of Trier; in March 1824 to Diocese of Hildesheim.

== Organization, extent and statistics ==
Under Article 14 of the Reichskonkordat of 1933, which remains in force, the determination of the bishop to head the episcopal see and the composition of the chapter are governed by the provisions of Baden Concordat of 1932.

As per 2014, it pastorally served 749,583 Catholics (25.9% of 2,891,000 total) on 7,692 km2 in 319 parishes, 504 priests (409 diocesan, 95 religious), 124 deacons, 447 lay religious (132 brothers, 315 sisters), 19 seminarians.

It is divided into 20 deaneries, which in turn are divided into 136 pastoral care units. In 2007 these parish associations or parish groups included all 335 parishes and other chaplaincies of the diocese (as of 2007). Pastoral units on the parish level have been introduced as a result of a profound structural change in the Catholic Church in Germany in many dioceses, the constitution of these units was determined by particular law [law of a particular region or territory], i.e., allowing for differences from one diocese to another. In the diocese of Mainz a parish group may be several parishes merged under the leadership of a single pastor. The parishes retain their church and state church legal personality. The pastor is attached to a pastoral team and a pastoral council. Parish associations, however, are combinations of several parishes, each with its own pastor. Several parish groups can join to form a parochial associations.

== Catholic Education==
=== Catholic Private Schools===

The most important educational institution of the Diocese is the Catholic University of Applied Sciences, Mainz. Besides the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz and the (arch)dioceses of Cologne, Limburg, Speyer and Trier belong to the initiators of this university .
There are also other schools as the Edith-Stein-Schule in Darmstadt, Liebfrauenschule in Bensheim, the Episcopal Willigis-Gymnasium in Mainz, Abendgymnasium Ketteler of Mainz and the Episcopal College Willigis secondary school in Mainz.

=== Facilities at state universities ===

<doc id="948688" wikidata="Q2301393" url="?curid=948688" title="Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class was a group of 58 destroyers built by the United States during World War II. Another twelve ships were completed as destroyer minelayers. The class was named for Allen Melancthon Sumner, an officer in the United States Marine Corps. Often referred to as simply the &quot;Sumner&quot;, this class was distinguished from the previous by their twin 5-inch/38 caliber gun mounts, dual rudders, additional anti-aircraft weapons, and many other advancements. The &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; design was extended amidships to become the , which was produced in larger numbers but did not see significant service in World War II.

Completed in 1943–45, four Sumners were lost in the war and two were damaged so badly they were scrapped, but the surviving ships served in the US Navy into the 1970s. After being retired from the US fleet, 29 of them were sold to other navies, where they served many more years. One still exists as a museum ship in South Carolina.

==Description==
The first ship was laid down in May 1943, while the last was launched in April 1945. In that time, the United States produced 58 &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;-class destroyers. The &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class was an improvement of the previous , which were built from 1941 until 1944. In addition to three twin 5-inch/38 caliber gun mounts replacing the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s&#x27; five single mounts, the &quot;Sumner&quot;s had twin rudders, giving them better maneuverability for ASW work when compared to the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s. The 5-inch guns were guided by a Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System with a Mark 25 fire control radar linked by a Mark 1A Fire Control Computer stabilized by a Mark 6 8,500 rpm gyro. This fire control system provided effective long-range anti-aircraft (AA) or anti-surface fire. The &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s also had larger set of short-range anti-aircraft armament than the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s, with 12 40 mm guns and 11 20 mm guns compared with the 10 40 mm and 7 20 mm complement typical of a late-war standard &quot;Fletcher&quot;. The initial design retained the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s&#x27; heavy torpedo armament of 10 tubes in two quintuple mounts, firing the Mark 15 torpedo. As the threat from &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft mounted in 1945, and with few remaining Japanese warships to use torpedoes on, most of the class had the aft quintuple 21-inch torpedo tube mount replaced by an additional 40 mm quadruple mount for 16 total 40 mm guns.

The &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s achieved a 20% increase in 5-inch gun armament and almost a 50% increase in light AA armament on a hull the same length as a &quot;Fletcher&quot;, only wider, and about 15 inches (38 cm) deeper in draft. The increase in standard displacement was only 150 tons, about 7.5%. Thus, the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class was a significant improvement in combat power at a small increase in cost.

See also the destroyer minelayer (DM), twelve of which were built on hulls originally intended as &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s. The s were of the same design, modified with a midship extension to carry more fuel to extend the ships&#x27; range.

==Service==
The &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s served on radar picket stations in the Battle of Okinawa, as well as other duties, and had several losses. &quot;Cooper&quot;, &quot;Meredith&quot;, &quot;Mannert L. Abele&quot;, and &quot;Drexler&quot; were lost during the war, and &quot;Hugh W. Hadley&quot; was so badly damaged by a kamikaze attack that she was scrapped soon after the war ended. In addition, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; was split in half in a collision with the aircraft carrier HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot;, and never repaired. After the war most of the class (except some of the light minelayers) had their 40 mm and 20 mm guns replaced by up to six 3-inch/50 caliber guns (76 mm), and the pole mast was replaced by a tripod to carry a new, heavier radar. On most ships one depth charge rack was removed and two Hedgehog mounts added. One of the two quintuple torpedo tube mountings had already been removed on most to make way for a quadruple 40 mm gun mounting and additional radar for the radar picket mission. 33 ships were converted under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II (FRAM II) program 1960–65, but not as extensively as the &quot;Gearing&quot;s. Typically, FRAM &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s retained all three 5-inch/38 twin mounts and received the Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH), two triple Mark 32 torpedo tubes for the Mark 44 torpedo, and two new single 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 torpedo, with all 3-inch and lighter guns, previous ASW armament, and 21-inch torpedo tubes being removed. Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) was also fitted; however, ASROC was not fitted. Ships that did not receive FRAM were typically upgraded with Mk 32 triple torpedo tubes in exchange for the K-guns, but retained Hedgehog and one depth charge rack.

In Navy slang, the modified destroyers were called &quot;FRAM cans&quot;, &quot;can&quot; being a contraction of &quot;tin can&quot;, the slang term for a destroyer or destroyer escort.

Many &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s provided significant gunfire support in the Vietnam War. They also served as escorts for Carrier Battle Groups (Carrier Strike Groups from 2004) and Amphibious Ready Groups (Expeditionary Strike Groups from 2006). From 1965, some of the class were transferred to the Naval Reserve Force (NRF), with a partial active crew to train Naval reservists.

==Disposition==
The ships served in the US Navy into the 1970s. DASH was withdrawn from anti-submarine warfare (ASW) service in 1969 due to poor reliability. Lacking ASROC, the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s were left without a standoff ASW capability and were decommissioned 1970–73, with most being transferred to foreign navies. The FRAM Sumners were effectively replaced as ASW ships by the s (destroyer escorts prior to 1975), which were commissioned 1969–74 &amp; carried a piloted helicopter, typically the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite &amp; ASROC. After the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s were retired from the US fleet, seven were sunk by the US in fleet training exercises and 13 were scrapped, while 29 were sold to other navies (two for spare parts) where they served for many more years. Twelve were sold to the Republic of China Navy, and two were sold to the Republic of Korea Navy. Two were sold to the Iran, and one was sold to Turkey. One was sold to Greece. Two were sold to Venezuela, two to Colombia, two to Chile, five to Brazil, and four to Argentina.

Currently, only , located at Patriots Point, Charleston, South Carolina, remains, as a museum ship.

== Other navies ==

=== Argentina ===
The Argentine Navy acquired four &quot;Sumners&quot; as a more capable adjunct to their previously acquired &quot;Fletcher&quot; class destroyers. While one was merely to provide spare parts to keep the rest of the fleet serviceable, the other three would go on and serve through the Falklands War, in which they would take a minor role. Soon after the conflict, they were stricken and disposed of.

<text>KPXC-TV (channel 59) is a television station in Denver, Colorado, United States, affiliated with Ion Television. Owned by Inyo Broadcast Holdings, the station maintains offices on South Jamaica Court in Aurora, and its transmitter is located in rural southwestern Weld County, east of Frederick.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on September 10, 1987, as KUBD. Originally operating as an independent station, the station aired financial news programming from the Financial News Network during the daytime hours and ran a general entertainment schedule at night. In 1989, KUBD became the original Denver area affiliate of the Spanish-language network Telemundo. FNN ceased operations two years later, when it was absorbed by CNBC. In 1995, KUBD was sold by its original ownership group (which included satellite TV entrepreneur Charlie Ergen) to Christian Network, Inc. (CNI), a non-profit organization co-founded by Bud Paxson, for $6.5 million. That year, KUBD switched to infomercial programming from inTV, and Telemundo programming moved to KSBS-TV (now KRMZ). The CNI stations, including KUBD, were sold to Paxson Communications in 1996.

The station changed its call letters to KPXC-TV on February 2, 1998; KPXC became a charter owned-and-operated station of Paxson&#x27;s new family-oriented broadcast network Pax TV (now Ion Television) when the network launched on August 31, 1998. In 2001, KPXC obtained the local television rights to carry select NHL games featuring the Colorado Avalanche; the deal to broadcast the games ended in 2003.

On December 15, 2014, Ion reached a deal to donate KPXC-TV&#x27;s low-power repeater in Fort Collins, KPXH-LD (channel 25), to Word of God Fellowship, parent company of the Daystar Television Network.

==Newscasts==

In September 2001, as part of its joint sales agreement with that station (the result of an overall deal between Pax TV and NBC), KPXC-TV began airing tape delayed rebroadcasts of Gannett&#x27;s NBC affiliate KUSA-TV (channel 9)&#x27;s 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts each Monday through Friday evening at 6:30 and 10:30 p.m. (the latter beginning shortly before that program&#x27;s live broadcast ended on KUSA). The news rebroadcasts ended on June 30, 2005, when the network&#x27;s other news share agreements with major network affiliates throughout the United States were terminated upon the network&#x27;s rebranding as i: Independent Television, as a result of the network&#x27;s financial troubles.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KPXC-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 59, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 43, using virtual channel 59.

<doc id="948693" wikidata="Q2340395" url="?curid=948693" title="Indigenous music of Australia">
<text>Indigenous music of Australia comprises the music of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia, intersecting with their cultural and ceremonial observances, through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and musical instrumentation that are unique to particular regions or Aboriginal Australian groups; and some elements of musical tradition are common or widespread through much of the Australian continent, and even beyond. The music of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of New Guinea. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians&#x27; cultural maintenance.

In addition to these Indigenous traditions and musical heritage, ever since the 18th-century European colonisation of Australia began, Indigenous Australian musicians and performers have adopted and interpreted many of the imported Western musical styles, often informed by and in combination with traditional instruments and sensibilities. Similarly, non-Indigenous artists and performers have adapted, used and sampled Indigenous Australian styles and instruments in their works. Contemporary musical styles such as rock and roll, country, rap, hip hop and reggae have all featured a variety of notable Indigenous Australian performers.

== Traditional instruments ==

===Didgeridoo===
A didgeridoo is a type of musical instrument that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of aerophone. It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It consists of a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are traditionally made of eucalyptus, but contemporary materials such as PVC piping are used. In traditional situations it is played only by men, usually as an accompaniment to ceremonial or recreational singing, or, much more rarely, as a solo instrument. Skilled players use the technique of circular breathing to achieve a continuous sound, and also employ techniques for inducing multiple harmonic resonances. Although traditionally the instrument was not widespread around the country - it was only used by Aboriginal groups in the most northerly areas - today it is commonly considered the national instrument of Aboriginal Australians and is world-renowned as a unique and iconic instrument. However, many Northern Aboriginal people continue to strenuously object to its frequent, inappropriate, use by both uninitiated Indigenous people of either gender, and by non-Indigenous Australians. Famous players include Djalu Gurruwiwi, Mark Atkins, William Barton, David Hudson, Joe Geia and Shane Underwood as well as white virtuoso Charlie McMahon. 

=== Clapsticks ===
A clapstick is a type of musical instrument that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of percussion. Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to strike a drum, clapsticks are intended for striking one stick on another, and people as well. They are of oval shape with paintings of snakes, lizards, birds and more. Also called &#x27;tatty&#x27; sticks.

=== Gum leaf ===

The leaf of the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; gum tree is used as a hand-held free reed instrument. The instrument was originally used to call birds. An example is the &quot;Coo-ee&quot; call seen in the opening credits of hit television series Skippy.

=== Bullroarer ===

The bullroarer (or bull roarer) is an instrument used in ceremonial ritual. It consists of a few feet of cord attached to a flat piece of wood. The player holds the free end of the cord and swings the piece of wood around in circles, thus creating a humming sound. The intensity of the sound can be varied by changing the velocity of the rotation.

=== Rasp ===
Percussive rasp similar to a Güiro or serrated club, along which the edge of a boomerang is drawn to produce a trill.

==Traditional forms==
===Clan songs/manikay===
Manikay are &quot;clan songs&quot; of some groups of Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land, including Yirrkala. These songs are often about clan or family history or other historical or mythological events of the area, social relationships and love, and are frequently updated to take into account popular films and music. Similar clan songs are known as emeba on Groote Eylandt. Manikay have been described as the &quot;sacred song tradition performed by the Yolŋu when conducting public ceremonies...a medium through which the Yolŋu interpret reality, define their humanity, reckon their ancestral lineages, and evidence ownership of their hereditary homelands through their ability to sing in the tradition of their ancestors&quot;. It is often translated as a &quot;clan song&quot;, and ethnomusicologists and social anthropologists have studied the form since the 1950s.

Manikay is often used to describe the song component of the Arnhem Land ceremony, while bunggul (see below) refers to the dance, although each word on its own is also sometimes used to refer to both components.

===Songlines===

Songlines, also known as &quot;dreaming tracks&quot;, represent paths across the land or sky marking the routes followed by creator beings during The Dreaming. The paths of the songlines are recorded in traditional song cycles, stories, dance, and art, and are often the basis of ceremonies. Intricate series of song cycles identify landmarks and tracking mechanisms for navigation.

===Transcription===

Early visitors and settlers published a number of transcriptions of traditional Aboriginal music. The earliest transcription of Aboriginal music was by Edward Jones in London in 1793, published in &quot;Musical Curiosities&quot;, 1811. Two Eora men (of the Sydney area in New South Wales), Yemmerrawanne and Bennelong, had travelled to England with Arthur Phillip, and while they were in London gave a recital of a song in the Dharug language.

===Northern Australia===
====Bunggul====
The Yolngu term Bunggul refers to song, music and dance, which form a ceremony in central to eastern Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. It is performed east of the Mann River as far south as Mainoru and southeast across the Rose River region to Numbulwar. The songs contain specific words and use a similar structure, and there is often a &quot;final recitative&quot;, where lyrics are sung for a long period after the didjeridu and stick beating has stopped. Some songs tell of epic journeys in the far past, of ancestors in the Dreaming; Elkin cited an example of a song series from consisting of 188 songs. Those of the &quot;Djatpangarri&quot; style, tell of everyday events. The lyrics differ much from song to song, and can vary from performance to performance, improvised by the musicians and lead &quot;songman&quot;, within certain structures and patterns. The leader of the ritual choreographs not only the dancers, but also the music, in this form, in contrast to western Arnhem Land, where the songman leads.

Bunggul is often used to describe the dance component of the ceremony, while manikay refers to the songs.

The Garma Festival has a nightly bunggul performance. In 2014, &quot;The Monthly&quot;″s &quot;Best of Australian Arts&quot; edition described the bunggul as &quot;an exhilarating performance&quot; and &quot;an example of one of the world’s oldest musical traditions. We must do everything to recognise its enormous value to our lives as Australians&quot;. In 2023, a special bunggul was performed in honour of the recently deceased Yolngu leader and land rights champion Galarrwuy Yunupingu.

====Kun-borrk====
Kun-borrk (also spelt kunborrk and gunborg) originated east of the Adelaide, southeast towards Katherine and across to just east of the Mann River and southeast almost to Rose River, then along the coastline beyond Borroloola.

Kun-borrk songs always include actual words, in contrast to other song styles of the region which may consist of sounds, and there are often brief breaks in the songs. The songs nearly always start with the didjeridu, soon followed by sticks (percussion) and vocals in that order. Kun-borrk songs from Kunbarllanjnja (Gunbalanya) almost always follow the order of didjeridu, voice then sticks. Kun-borrk songs terminate most commonly with the didjeridu first, often in conjunction with vocals. Sometimes the vocals finish first, sometimes the clap sticks, but the didjeridu never starts last or finishes last.

David Blanasi is known as a master of the tradition of Kun-borrk, with his grandson Darryl Dikarrna continuing the tradition.

====Wajarra====
Wajarra are non-sacred songs originating in the Gurindji region of the Northern Territory and performed for fun and entertainment. During the twentieth century they spread great distances across northern and western Australia, including along the stock routes of the pastoral industry, as Aboriginal workers and their families travelled between stations. Wave Hill Station was the site of much of this exchange.

====Wangga====

Wangga originated near the South Alligator River. An extremely high note starts the song, accompanied by rhythmic percussion, followed by a sudden shift to a low tone. Wangga is typically performed by one or two singers with clapsticks and one didgeridoo player. The occasion is usually a circumcision ceremony or a ceremony to purify a dead person&#x27;s belongings with smoke.

==Contemporary trends==

A number of Indigenous Australians have achieved mainstream prominence, such as Jimmy Little (pop), Yothu Yindi (Australian aboriginal rock), Troy Cassar-Daley (country), Jessica Mauboy (pop, R&amp;B), NoKTuRNL (rap metal) and the Warumpi Band (alternative or world music). Indigenous music has also gained broad exposure through the world music movement and in particular the WOMADelaide festivals. Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, formerly of Yothu Yindi, attained international success singing contemporary music in English and in one of the languages of the Yolngu people.

Successful Torres Strait Islander musicians include Christine Anu (pop) and Seaman Dan.

Contemporary Indigenous music continues the earlier traditions and also represents a fusion with contemporary mainstream styles of music, such as rock and country music. The Deadlys provide an illustration of this with rock, country, pop among the styles played. Traditional instruments such as the didjeridu and clapsticks are commonly used, giving the music a distinctive feel.

Country music has remained particularly popular among the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for decades, as documented in Clinton Walker&#x27;s seminal &quot;Buried Country&quot;. Dougie Young and Jimmy Little were pioneers and Troy Cassar-Daley is among Australia&#x27;s successful contemporary Indigenous performers of country music. Aboriginal artists Kev Carmody and Archie Roach employ a combination of folk-rock and country music to sing about Aboriginal rights issues, using the song type called &quot;barnt&quot;. The documentary, book and soundtrack &quot;Buried Country&quot; showcases significant Indigenous musicians from the 1940s to the 1990s.

The movie &quot;Wrong Side of the Road&quot; and its soundtrack (1981), highlighting Indigenous disadvantage in urban Australia, gave broad exposure to the bands Us Mob and No Fixed Address.

Australian hip hop music and rap music has a number of Aboriginal exponents, including the award-winning Baker Boy, 2019 Young Australian of the Year, who raps and sings in Yolngu Matha.

The genre-defying Mojo Juju has been nominated for or won several awards since 2018, and her music has been featured in a number of television shows including &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Roadtrip Nation&quot;.

Thelma Plum released her debut album, &quot;Better in Blak&quot;, in July 2019.

DOBBY is an Aboriginal/Filipino musician, mostly rapper and drummer, who has played with the Sydney band Jackie Brown Jr. As a member of the Murrawarri Republic, he sings in Murrawarri language as well as English, and is a political activist for Aboriginal issues.

The nephew of Dr M. Yunupiŋu and the son of Stuart Kellaway, both founding members of Yothu Yindi, started their own band, King Stingray, whose sound they call &quot;Yolngu surf rock&quot;. Their first single, written by Yirrnga Yunupiŋu and Roy Kellaway, was released in October 2020.

In 2024, and at the age of 80, blues musician Kankawa Nagarra (Olive Knight)&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Wirlmarni&quot;, won the prestigous Australian Music Prize (AMP).

==Training institutions==
The Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music (CASM), founded in 1972, now exists as part of the National Centre for Aboriginal Language and Music Studies at the University of Adelaide, located within the Elder Conservatorium. While it has in the past (1980s) offered three-year diploma courses, it offers only a one-year foundation course, owing to funding cuts over the years. CASM has access to a state-of-the-art dedicated recording studio, along with teaching and practice rooms, a dance room, a keyboard suite, and computer suites. Notable alumni include the bands Coloured Stone, No Fixed Address, Kuckles, and Us Mob, as well as musicians Zaachariaha Fielding (of the duo Electric Fields), Ellie Lovegrove, Nathan May, Tilly Tjala Thomas, and Simi Vuata.

<text>Jazz music has a long history in Australia. Over the years jazz has held a high-profile at local clubs, festivals and other music venues and a vast number of recordings have been produced by Australian jazz musicians, many of whom have gone on to gain a high profile in the international jazz arena.

Jazz is an American musical genre originated by African Americans but the style was rapidly and enthusiastically taken up by musicians all over the world, including Australia. Jazz and jazz-influenced syncopated dance music was being performed in Australia within a year of the emergence of jazz as a definable musical genre in the United States.

Until the 1950s the primary form of accompaniment at Australian public dances was jazz-based dance music, modeled on the leading white British and American jazz bands, and this style enjoyed wide popularity.

It was not until after World War II that Australian jazz scene began to diversify as local musicians were finally able to get access to recordings by leading African-American jazz musicians like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, with bebop, cool jazz and free jazz exerting a strong influence on Australian musicians in the late 1950s and beyond.

Although jazz in Australia suffered a significant drop in popularity during the Sixties, as it did in most other countries, there was a marked resurgence of interest in the Seventies, Eighties and Nineties as a new generation of musicians came to the fore.

As in the popular field, it is also important to acknowledge the role of New Zealand musicians on the Australian jazz scene – in the view of jazz historian Andrew Bisset, it is impossible to properly discuss the subject of Australian jazz without reference to New Zealand. Many of the leading &quot;Australian&quot; jazz playing musicians of the last 80 years have come from New Zealand, beginning with figures like reeds player Abe Romaine in the 1920s and later including renowned pianist-composers Judy Bailey, Mike Nock and Dave MacRae, and vocalist Ricky May.

==Jazz precursors in Australia==
White American and British &#x27;black face&#x27; bards (musician/actors in make-up) brought imitations of slave plantation music (and dance) to Australia by the 1840s, featuring characteristics that later became associated with jazz, such as polyrhythmic &#x27;breaks&#x27;. From the 1850s, full minstrel shows with minstrel &#x27;orchestras&#x27;, including locally formed troupes, toured the major capital cities and smaller, boom towns like Ballarat and Bendigo. Visits by American vaudeville troupes became much more common after the introduction of regular steamship services between America and Australia in the 1870s. Some genuine African-American minstrel troupes and Jubilee Singers (black chamber choirs) toured from the 1870s.

Ragtime reached Australia in the 1890s in the form of syncopated cakewalk march music and syncopated &quot;coon-song&quot; and many white and black ragtime artists of repute toured Australia, including the black ragtime vocalist, Ernest Hogan, and white artists Ben Harney (the self-proclaimed &#x27;originator&#x27; of ragtime) and Gene Greene (the Emperor of Ragtime). Greene in particular taught many Australian artists how to &#x27;rag&#x27; (improvise in ragtime style).

==Early 20th century==

Belle Sylvia and Her Jazz Band were billed as &quot;Australia’s first jazz band&quot; when they performed at Ben Fuller&#x27;s National Theatre in Sydney in 1918, though they were a band imported from England.

Thanks to close Australian links with American theatrical entertainment circuits, and Tin Pan Alley marketing of American music to Australia via phonograph records, modern dance arrangements, piano rolls and visiting jazz acts, Australians developed a strong interest in jazz influenced dance music and its related forms. &#x27;Jazz&#x27; or &#x27;jass&#x27; (hot dance music) was well established by the mid-1920s. Jazz was recorded on piano-rolls in Australia before 1923 and disc recordings like &quot;Red Hot Mamma&quot; and &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; by Ray Tellier&#x27;s San Francisco Orchestra were also being recorded by 1925.

The biggest musical influence in the period 1923–1928 was a succession of visiting white American jazz (or dance) orchestras, mainly from the West Coast. Frank Ellis and his Californians, who arrived in 1923. Thousands of dance fans regularly flocked to see them at Sydney&#x27;s largest dance hall, the Palais Royale (the Royal Hall of Industries at Moore Park, which still stands today). American bands and individual imported &#x27;jazz specialists&#x27;continued to be imported by Australian theatrical entrepreneurs until the end of the 1920s. Australians could study the performance and presentation style of these bands first-hand and talented local musicians were soon offered places in some of them.

Restrictions on touring American bands after 1928, resulting from the forced departure of the visiting African-American band Sonny Clay&#x27;s Plantation Orchestra meant that Australian dance musician usually had to learn about jazz from recorded or written sources. These included imported recordings, dance arrangements, jazz on film (after 1929), patent &#x27;how to jazz courses&#x27;, individual visiting artists (most of whom were white) and literature such as &quot;Australian Dance Band News&quot; (1932–with subsequent title changes).

However, from the early 1930s, Australian dance musicians began to hear and absorb the work of black artists and leaders like Duke Ellington and Armstrong as well as English jazz influences. Notable swing bands of the 1930s included Jim Davidson &amp; His New Palais Royal Orchestra, Frank Coughlan &amp; His Trocadero Orchestra, Dudley Cantrell &amp; His Grace Grenadiers, and numerous others and many were recorded.

Australian jazz musician Bert Howell toured the world in 1933 playing compositions like &quot;Wabash Moon&quot; by Australian composer Reginald Stoneham.

Trombonist and bandleader Frank Coughlan (1904–1979) has been called &quot;The Father of Australian Jazz&quot;. He had an illustrious career that lasted from the early 1920s to the 1970s. He was chosen to lead the famous jazz orchestra that was put together for the opening in 1936 of the Sydney Trocadero, which became the city&#x27;s leading dance venue for the next 35 years, and Coughlan led the orchestra at &quot;The Troc&quot; until its closure in 1971.

==Post-World War II jazz==
After the end of World War II Australian jazz began to diverge into two major strands: dixieland or &#x27;traditional jazz&#x27; (early jazz) and modern styles like progressive swing, boogie-woogie and bop as exemplified by the music of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie

Graeme Bell was an important contributor to Melbourne&#x27;s 1940s traditional jazz boom and in 1947 his band, with the support of Harry Stein, was a great success when they played at the World Youth Festival in Prague, Czechoslovakia, going on to tour Europe and finally basing themselves in England where they are said to have exerted a strong influence on the European traditional jazz revival of that era. On returning to Australia Graeme Bell&#x27;s Jazz Band worked successfully on the local club circuit, as well as recording and touring extensively.

The Australian Jazz Quartet/Quintet was a contemporary Australian jazz group that did very well in the US at that time. In the early 1950s pianist Bryce Rohde along with Errol Buddle (reeds) and Jack Brokensha (vibes and drums) moved from Australia to Windsor in Canada. An agent heard them play locally and asked if they would come across the border to back female vocalist Chris Connor at a nightclub in Detroit. This started the ball rolling, and in 1953, along with American saxophonist and bassist Dick Healey, they formed the Australian Jazz Quartet.

This very successful unit recorded ten albums and worked at most major US jazz venues. Sometimes a bass player and drummer would be hired to complement the group during recording sessions, and when they ultimately added a permanent bass player they renamed themselves the Australian Jazz Quintet (AJQ). American bassist Ed Gaston joined the AJQ while they were touring the US in 1958 and he later married and settled down in Australia, becoming an important contributor to the local jazz scene in the ensuing years. Drummer Colin Bailey played with the AJQ from 1958–60.

The AJQ was highly rated in polls run by US jazz magazines such as &quot;Down Beat&quot;. They worked on the same bill as names like Miles Davis, Count Basie, Gerry Mulligan, Dave Brubeck and the Modern Jazz Quartet; backed singers Billie Holiday and Carmen McRae; and played at top venues such as Carnegie Hall and Birdland.

Another Australian jazz musician, bassist Bruce Cale, was an early collaborator with Bryce Rohde in Sydney, and subsequently moved to London where he worked with the famous Tubby Hayes Quartet and other jazz groups before relocating to the US in 1966. He went on to play in bands led by John Handy, Ernie Watts, John Klemmer and Jack Walrath, to name just a few. Based in the US for several years, Cale also worked with Zoot Sims, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Mose Allison, James Zitro, ContraBand, Phil Woods, Alan Dawson ... Back in Australia in the late 1970s he worked with most of Australia&#x27;s leading musicians and in particular his own quartet with Dale Barlow, Roger Frampton and Phil Treloar. In the 1980s he concentrated on composition, working on specially commissioned pieces and also studied with George Russell. In the intervening years he has performed with many of his favourite jazz musicians in Australia including Julian Lee, Kevin Hunt, Mike Nock, Bob Bertles, John Sangster, Sandy Evans and many more. His bass sound has been heard by anyone who ever listened to Jim McLeods JazzTrack on ABC Radio as the memorable signature music for many years was Windows of Arquez which he recorded with Bryce Rhode. 

The El Rocco became a legend in Australian jazz history and in the 1980s a documentary movie &quot;Beyond The El Rocco&quot; was made about the club. Many of Sydney&#x27;s top musicians worked there early in their careers including John Sangster, John Pochee, Don Burrows, George Golla, Alan Turnbull and Judy Bailey.

The Three Out trio with Mike Nock (Piano), Freddy Logan (Bass), and Chris Karan (Drums) attracted some of the largest crowds at Sydney&#x27;s El Rocco, a small cellar club situated in Kings Cross. Originally from New Zealand, Mike Nock came to Sydney in the late 1950s and almost immediately scored a regular spot at the El Rocco. Bassist Freddy Logan hailed from the Netherlands and had already been very active in the Sydney jazz scene both as a player and a promoter of jazz, and in later years drummer Chris Karan would gain international recognition as a member of the Dudley Moore Trio.

The members of the Three Out Trio first got together as part of a group that Sydney alto saxophonist Frank Smith put together as the house band at &quot;The Embers&quot;, a very successful jazz club in Melbourne that also featured top international jazz artists such as the Oscar Peterson Trio and Benny Carter. Before he left for Melbourne Frank Smith had made a big impression in Sydney, he worked with most of the top professional bands and could often be found playing at the El Rocco in its earlier years. A handful of Sydney jazz musicians including John Pochee, Barry Woods, Dave MacRae, Andy Brown and Bernie McGann also travelled south around that time, finding work in venues such as &quot;The Fat Black Pussycat&quot;, another Melbourne jazz club that provided an outlet for those intent on playing uncompromising forms of jazz. The most successful group to appear at Sydney&#x27;s Mocambo Restaurant in King St Newtown was the Mocambo Four, with Sid Edwards (Vibraphone), Tony Esterman (Piano), Winston Sterling (Bass) and Laurie Kennedy (Drums). The piano chair was also filled by Tony Curby or Bob Dunn over the band&#x27;s stint of around 4 years during the early 1960s. This venue was very well attended, with people often lined up in the street waiting to get in.

In 1957, jazz producer Horst Liepolt set up a new venue in Melbourne, &quot;Jazz Centre 44&quot;. For four to five nights a week, and Sunday afternoons, up to 200 people would gather in the upstairs room to hear Brian Brown, Stewie Speer, Alan Lee, Graeme Morgan, Keith Hounslow, the Melbourne New Orleans Jazz Band and many other local jazz musicians, and Jazz Centre 44 remained a major venue for jazz in Melbourne for almost a decade.

===Impact of television===
Television was an important source of work for jazz musicians in the early-mid-1960s; the GTV-9 house band, which provided music for programs like Graham Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; employed many of best players on the Melbourne jazz/session scene and showcased younger entrants into the scene, such as The Red Onion Jazz Band. Melbourne musicians like Brian Brown, Bruce Clarke and Frank Smith also worked extensively on soundtracks and advertising music, and Clarke&#x27;s Jingle Workshop studio in St Kilda, which produced much important music in these genres, was a significant focus, not merely for its commercial work, but also because it was the venue for regular Sunday jam sessions, many of which Clarke recorded.

Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll rapidly gained popularity in the youth music scene from the mid-1950s and pop and rock continued to dominate in the Sixties and beyond. Many leading jazz performers like Graeme Lyall, Stewie Speer and John Sangster and Tony Buchanan worked with rock groups and absorbed important stylistic influences from the Motown, soul music and funk genres.

From the late 1960s, there was a revival to the &#x27;big band&#x27; format, partly fuelled by the popularity of big band rock ensembles like Blood Sweat &amp; Tears and Chicago. The most notable local modern big band was the acclaimed but short-lived Daly-Wilson Big Band, which enjoyed considerable popularity and which was the first Australian musical act to tour the Soviet Union. Another very popular band is Galapagos Duck, who exerted a huge influence on the Sydney jazz scene as part-owners of and regular performers at Sydney&#x27;s longest-running jazz venue, The Basement, which opened in 1973. Serge Ermoll&#x27;s Free Kata, the first free jazz ensemble to record and internationally release a series of albums including &quot;The New Language of Music&quot; on EMI and the Philips Records title &quot;Spontaneous Improvisations&quot;.

An early example of jazz on Australian television was &quot;Sweet and Low&quot;, a 1959 ABC series which aired for a six-episode season. Another series was &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Dropped In&quot;, a four-episode ABC series that aired 1957–1958, and 1959 ABC series &quot;Australian All Star Jazz Band&quot;.

=== Women in jazz ===
Women had played in jazz bands of their own since the early 1920s, with bands led by Thelma Ready, Eve Rees, Alice Dolphin, and Grace Funston, among others. The groups were often considered a novelty by the press, but received employment at venues such as Melbourne&#x27;s Palais Pictures. The groups gained further popularity during World War II, but many found themselves unemployed following the war, with Grace Funston complaining that when the male musicians had returned the women lost their jobs. Singer Barbara James was considered one of Australia&#x27;s most famous big band vocalists during the 1930s. She performed with Jim Davidson and Frank Coughlan, among others.

At the Palais, an all female band continued to perform until 1949 when the big band sound began to lose favour with the public.

==Jazz in the 1970s==
A very significant development in 1973 was the inception of the jazz studies course at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, the first jazz course to be offered by an Australian tertiary institution. The then Director of the Sydney Conservatorium, Rex Hobcroft, was approached by jazz musician Don Burrows about the idea of putting together a jazz studies course. Radio station Fine Music Sydney (then known as 2MBS) was launched in 1974 and would broadcast jazz music to this day.

Ultimately American saxophonist and music educator Howie Smith was brought to Sydney on a grant from the Fulbright Program to set up the course. The grant was originally for 9 months but Howie Smith ended up staying for three years, and as well as his involvement with the Conservatorium he also became very active in the Sydney jazz scene, mostly with the group Jazz Co/op which also included local musicians Roger Frampton (piano), Jack Thorncraft (bass) and Phil Treloar (drums).

When The Basement opened its doors it became Sydney&#x27;s major jazz club during the seventies, and its success encouraged many other venue owners to hire jazz groups. Jazz producer Horst Liepolt, who was booking bands for The Basement, became very active at that time and he set in motion a number of jazz venues and events, including The Manly Jazz Festival, Jazz at the Sydney Festival and his own series of jazz concerts titled &quot;Music is an Open Sky&quot;. Horst Liepolt also set up the 44 record label (a subsidiary of Phonogram records) which recorded over 30 albums of local jazz. He also organised numerous successful concerts at many of Sydney&#x27;s high-profile entertainment venues including the Sydney Opera House and the Regent Theatre.

This major resurgence of Australian jazz took place mostly in Sydney, but it had some flow-on effects in the jazz scene throughout Australia. Many jazz musicians came to Sydney from other areas of Australia during this decade, either to perform at special concerts or in some cases to live permanently and pursue a career in music. There was also a more than usual interest for jazz in Melbourne during the 1970s. Jazz performances were included in the Moomba Festival and Melbourne jazz musicians such as Tony Gould, Brian Brown, Bob Sedergreen and Ted Vining benefited from the resurgence of interest in the music at that time.

A lot of top American jazz musicians performed in Sydney during the seventies, and major players such as Dave Liebman, John Scofield and Miroslav Vitous gave master classes and workshops while they were there.

Bob Barnard has become an icon of Australian jazz and has probably made more of an impression internationally than any other Australian jazz musician. In the year of 1974 the Bob Barnard Jazz Band was formed.

Jazz fusion, as typified by groups like Return to Forever, largely passed Australia by, although the group Crossfire was probably the best and best-known Australian act to work in this area.

Some of the many working jazz groups in Sydney during the seventies were the Jazz Co/op, John Pochee&#x27;s The Last Straw, The Don Burrows Quartet, the Galapagos Duck, The Judy Bailey Quartet, Kerrie Biddell and Compared to What, the Bob Barnard Jazz Band, Paul Furniss&#x27; Eclipse Alley Five, Col Nolan and the Soul Syndicate featuring vocalist Johnny Nicol, the Peter Boothman / Sid Edwards quartet, Serge Ermoll and Free Kata, and Craig Benjamin&#x27;s Out To Lunch.

The jazz scene in Sydney slowed down a little towards the start of the 1980s when The Basement pursued a more commercial music policy after extending their premises by adding a large upstairs area. Around that same time Horst Liepolt left Australia, going on to a successful career in jazz production in New York, and this left a major gap in the area of jazz promotion in Sydney. However traditional and mainstream bands continued to do well in the pub scene and contemporary jazz could still be found in venues such as The Paradise at Kings Cross, Jenny&#x27;s in the inner city and Morgan&#x27;s Feedwell at Glebe.

==1980s and 1990s==
Before the 1980s co-ordination of Jazz concerts was particularly lacking. The NSW Jazz Co-ordination program helped the establishment of the Sydney Improvised Music Association in Sydney quickly followed by the establishment of the Melbourne Jazz Co-operative in 1982. Both sought and gained Federal Government Arts Council funding soon after establishment. Similar Jazz co-ordination programs were established in other states with Arts Council and State Government Funding.

Through the 1980s and 1990s jazz remained a small but vibrant sector of the Australian music industry. Despite its relative lack of visibility in the mass market, Australian jazz continued to develop to a high level of creativity and professionalism that, for the most part, has been inversely proportional to its low level of public and industry recognition and acceptance.

Players who were more influenced by traditional or cool jazz streams tended to dominate public attention and some moved successfully into academia. Multi-instrumentalist Don Burrows was for several decades a regular presence on television and radio, as well as being a prolific session musician. His quartets (usually with George Golla on guitar) played at many of the top international jazz festivals and he recorded prolifically in the 1970s and 80s. Although Burrows made no secret of his dislike for the bebop and free jazz strands, he became a senior teacher at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and has exerted a strong influence on Australian jazz through his recordings, performances and teaching.

Burrows&#x27; protege, trumpeter James Morrison, who was heavily influenced by Louis Armstrong, has carved out a very successful career playing a style not unlike that of Wynton Marsalis, that blended some modern elements (e.g. the crowd-pleasing high-register technical bravura of Dizzy Gillespie) with the accessible structures and melodies of &#x27;trad&#x27; and &#x27;cool&#x27; jazz.

Another important figure in Australian jazz education was Melbourne musician/composer Brian Brown. In his early career Brown had been a pioneer of the Australian hard bop stream, and (with close friend and longtime bandmate Stewie Speer) Brown&#x27;s various groups were leading lights of Melbourne&#x27;s legendary Jazz Centre 44 from the late 1950s. Through the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s however, Brown&#x27;s group sound and compositional ideas moved away from the &#x27;classic&#x27; American modern jazz idiom, and he developed his own distinctive style that concentrated on interactive improvisation. Brown founded the jazz course at the Victorian College of the Arts in 1980 and headed it for the next 18 years, and through his weekly Workshop classes he influenced hundreds of young musicians with his ideas on group performance.

Multi-instrumental wind player Dale Barlow emerged in the late 1970s as one of the most promising new talents on the Australian scene, and after stints in the Young Northside Big Band and a formative period in the David Martin Quintet (with James Morrison), he moved to New York, where he was a member of two famed groups, the Cedar Walton Quartet and Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers. Barlow has also toured and recorded with many other jazz greats including Sonny Stitt, Chet Baker, Gil Evans, Jackie McLean, Billy Cobham, Curtis Fuller, Eddie Palmieri, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Golson, Lee Konitz, Sonny Stitt, Helen Merrill, Mulgrew Miller and Kenny Barron. In 1980 he performed at concerts in Adelaide and Sydney with the Bruce Cale Quartet with Roger Frampton (piano and saxes) Bruce Cale (bass) and Phil Treloar (drums). Two live concerts by this group have been recorded, The Bruce Cale Quartet Live (Adelaide concert) and On Fire – The Sydney Concert.

Guitarist Tony Barnard one of the new breed of musicians to emerge during the late 70s and early 80s, playing bebop, mainstream and original material. Before he reached the age of 20, Barnard had recorded with Don Burrows and John Sangster, toured extensively, performed at the Sydney Opera house and played with overseas stars and just about everybody in the Sydney jazz scene, holding down up to four residencies a week, including the Basement, the Old Rocks push, and Tides Wine bar in Bondi. He formed the band Interplay, Australia&#x27;s first five guitar ensemble performing big band repertoire to critical acclaim. His popular &quot;All Hat Jazz Band&quot; packing the Unity Hall Hotel in Balmain for some 6 years. In the late 90s moving to the UK, touring Europe and performing with stars like, Keely Smith, Rufus Reid, Curtis Stigers and Kevin Spacey, also joining the much lauded and famous Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Orchestra where he has been resident guitarist for 8 years. Barnard&#x27;s double album The Australian Suite, was received with praise by critics.

Many &quot;second generation&quot; bebop-influenced performers like New Zealand born pianist Mike Nock, bassist Lloyd Swanton, saxophonist Dale Barlow, pianist Chris Abrahams, saxophonist Sandy Evans, pianist and Roger Frampton (who died in 2000) rose to prominence in this period, alongside their older contemporaries, led by Bernie McGann and John Pochee, whose long-running group The Last Straw (founded in 1974) has carried the torch for this stream of jazz for many years.

New Zealand-born pianist-composer Dave McRae established himself as a performer of note in Australia in the 1960s before moving overseas, where he branched out into a diverse range of activities including a stint as the keyboard player in the British 1970s progressive rock group Matching Mole and collaborating with Bill Oddie of The Goodies on music for their TV series. Tony Buchanan, saxophonist, played with Dave Macrae in London. They formed a small jazz band called Galapagus Duck. Tony Buchanan went on to play in Maynard Ferguson&#x27;s Canadian Big Band and also did a short stint on baritone sax in the Buddy Rich Big Band. He also toured with big names such as Frank Sinatra, Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, Shirley MacLaine and others.

The trio of Tony Buck (drums), and the aforementioned Lloyd Swanton (bass) and Chris Abrahams (piano), known together as The Necks since forming in 1987 (see 1987 in music), have been particularly notable for hypnotic hour-long jazz, ambient and otherwise widely influenced spontaneous compositions, gaining widespread attention both in Australia and internationally. Their album &quot;Drive-By&quot;, which consists of a single 60-minute track, was named Jazz Album of the Year in the 2004 ARIA Awards.

==2000 to present==
During the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a noticeable trend back towards jazz by many popular performers who had been associated with the rock genre. Most notable amongst these were Kate Ceberano and Vince Jones who released traditional jazz or jazz-influenced albums within a very short period of time which included high record sales and performances to large audiences.

Compared to the latter years of the 1900s jazz lost some of its impetus in Australia in the first decade of the twenty-first century. However it is still very visible in a number of venues including Melbourne&#x27;s Bennett&#x27;s Lane Jazz Club and concerts in Sydney staged by groups such as Sydney Improvised Music Association, Venue 505, The Jazzgroove Association, and The Jazz Action Society. The Melbourne Jazz Co-operative since 2007 has run three jazz concerts a week in Melbourne, the most active jazz presenter organisation in Australia.

The early 2000s saw the introduction of jazz studies at Monash University: a jazz program that is now a leader in jazz education in Australia with staff including Robert Burke, Paul Williamson, Jordan Murray and Johannes Luebbers. The award-winning Monash Art Ensemble (MAE) is their flagship ensemble promoting experimentation and Australian music. The program also produced a long series or recordings (Monash Sessions) inclusive of National and International collaboration.

In the 2010s, jazz music continues to be a valid and visible form of expression in Australia. Although jazz is virtually ignored by mainstream media, Australia is home to one of the only national 24/7 jazz networks in the world, ABC Jazz as part of the national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). 

ABC Jazz broadcasts jazz 24 hours a day on DAB+ Digital Radio, Digital TV, online at abc.net.au/jazz and on the ABC Radio mobile app. It broadcasts original presented shows by Mal Stanley, Megan Burslem, James Valentine and Monica Trapaga, as well as weekly featured albums, live sets, and interviews. ABC Jazz also records local acts and broadcasts local content in the regular playlist.

== Australian jazz festivals ==
Jazz festivals have been staged across Australia, with the 1st Annual Australian International Jazz Festival held in 1960 in four states featuring international and local acts. More recent festivals include the Adelaide Jazz Festival, Dingo Creek Jazz and Blues Festival, Grampians Jazz Festival, Manly Jazz Festival, Melbourne Jazz Festival, Melbourne Jazz Fringe Festival, Perth International Jazz Festival, Stonnington Jazz Festival, Sydney International Women’s Jazz Festival, Wagga Wagga Jazz Festival, and Wangaratta Festival of Jazz.

==Australian Jazz Convention==

Commencing in 1946, the Australian Jazz Convention is the longest running annual jazz event in the world. The Convention archives are housed at the Australian Jazz Museum, which maintains a collection of Australian and overseas jazz materials. The first convention was co-founded by pianist Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; McIntyre.

The 68th Australian Jazz Convention was held in Goulburn, NSW, from 26 to 31 December 2013. Over 500 Musicians, Delegates and Day Pass Holders participated in the Convention. This was the first Convention arranged by the AJC Executive Task Force Inc, a group of 6 jazz musicians and enthusiasts formed after the 67th Australian Jazz Convention failed to be provided with an option for the 68th Convention.

Following the success of the 68th Australian Jazz Convention the Annual General Meeting on 30 December 2013 endorsed the recommendation of the AJC Executive Task Force that the 69th Australian Jazz Convention be held at Swan Hill, Victoria from 26 to 31 December 2014. This Convention saw an increase in the number of musicians and delegates on those that participated in the 68th. A highlight of the Convention was the participation of 30 young musicians from the VJC Jazz Youth Workshop.

On 30 December 2014, the 69th AGM was presented with two options for the 70th AJC by the AJC ETF, Penrith NSW and Ballarat Victoria. The meeting selected Ballarat as the venue. The AJC was hosted by Ballarat for four years, the longest the Convention has settled since inception. At the 73rd AJC, 30th December 2018, the AGM accepted a proposal from Albury to host the 74th AJC. 

The 74th AJC (2019), under continued management by the AJC ETF, hosted for the first time in over 30 years guest artists. With financial support from the NSW Government Marla Dixon (trumpet and vocals) and Shaye Cohn (piano and cornet), band leaders from New Orleans, performed throughout the 74th AJC with Australian musicians. Their presence was greeted by popular acclaim from Musicians and Delegates.

Regrettably, the 75th AJC, scheduled for December 2020 was postponed until December 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Australian jazz archives ==
Australia has two main jazz archives, the Australian Jazz Museum and the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Australian Jazz Archive. The latter was started in 1997 by members of the Australian jazz community, and collects photos, recordings, and oral histories.

The Australian Jazz Museum begun in 1996 as the Victorian Jazz Archive, but later became the Australian Jazz Museum in 2014, to better reflect their national role, after several other Australian state jazz archives closed.

The Australian Performing Arts Collection also includes jazz related content in their collections, such as collections of Canberra Jazz Club, Grace Funston, and Jim Davidson, as well as photographs from events such as Melbourne International Jazz Festival, and Stonnington Jazz Festival.

== Australian jazz magazines ==
Established in 1932, Music Maker was a Sydney-based magazine available nationally, with a focus on jazz music. In 1957 they ran a poll to find the most popular jazz musicians in Australia. The winners recorded an album, and included Ken Brentnall (trumpet), Johnny Bamford (trombone), Frank Smith (alto sax), Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Cunningham (flute), Don Burrows (clarinet), Dave Owens (tenor sax), Terry Wilkinson (piano), Johnny Weine (guitar), Pat Caplice (vibraphone), Ron Webber (drums), and Freddy Logan (bass). 

Other titles included Jazz notes (started 1941), The beat (1949), Matrix (1954), Jazz down under (1974), Jazz Australia (1980), Jazz (1984), and Dingo (2021). AJazz (2016), formerly V Jazz (1998), is the quarterly magazine of the Australian Jazz Museum.
