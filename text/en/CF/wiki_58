<text>Shasta Lake, also popularly known as Lake Shasta, is a reservoir in Shasta County, California, United States. It began to store water in 1944 due to the impounding of the Sacramento River by Shasta Dam, the ninth-tallest dam in the US.

Shasta Lake is a key facility of the Central Valley Project and provides flood control for the Sacramento Valley, downstream of the dam. Water outflow generates power through the Shasta Powerplant and is subsequently used for irrigation and municipal purposes.

The reservoir lies within the Whiskeytown–Shasta–Trinity National Recreation Area, operated by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. 

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has formed a safe-eating advisory for fish caught in the lake, based on levels of mercury and PCBs found in local species. The Shasta-Keswick Reservoir system is significantly contaminated with heavy metals, primarily due to contributions from four streams. Three of these streams contain acid mine drainage, with Spring Creek being the most notable contributor, releasing high concentrations of cadmium, copper and zinc into the water. At the points where these acid streams mix with lake water, localized toxicity occurs, posing an immediate threat to aquatic life. The synergistic effects of these metals further exacerbate the environmental impact, leading to concerns about the safety of consuming fish from this water source.

==Geography==
With a capacity of at full pool, the lake has an elevation of , and a surface area of , making it the state&#x27;s largest reservoir, and its third-largest body of water after Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea.

Ten miles (16 km) north of the city of Redding, with the town of Lakehead on its northern shore, Shasta Lake is popular for boating, water skiing, camping, house boating and fishing. Formed by the damming of the Sacramento River, the lake has of mostly steep mountainous shoreline covered with tall evergreen trees and manzanita. The maximum depth is .

The lake has four major arms, each created by an approaching river: the Sacramento River, the McCloud River, Sulanharas Creek, and the Pit River. The Sacramento River&#x27;s source is the Klamath Mountains. The McCloud River&#x27;s source is Mount Shasta. The Pit River flows from Alturas, and the waterfall Potem Falls is located on that arm of the lake.

==History==
Shasta Dam was constructed between 1935 and 1945 across the Sacramento River, and Shasta Lake was formed in 1948. The Pit River, McCloud River, and several smaller tributaries had their lower courses and confluences with the Sacramento River submerged by the reservoir. Also beneath the lake is the submerged town of Kennett and many village sites of the Wintun people together with their traditional fishing, hunting, and gathering locations. Parts of the defunct tunnels and right of way of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company can be seen when the water level is low.

Shasta Lake hosted the first &quot;Boardstock&quot; event in 1996, which continued there annually through 1999, after which the annual event moved to Clear Lake, California, 170 miles southwest of Shasta Lake. Boardstock drew many professional wakeboard riders from around the world, with an average attendance of 15,000 people. The event lasted for 3 days each year with several wakeboard contests being performed.

==Marinas==

There are a number of marinas on Shasta Lake offering a variety of services, including houseboat rentals.

* Bridge Bay Marina is the largest marina on Shasta Lake, with over 700 slips. It has a restaurant and bar and lodging, as well as retail and other facilities.

<text>The Philippine archipelago is one of the world&#x27;s great reservoirs of biodiversity and endemism. The archipelago includes over 7000 islands, and a total land area of 300,780 km2.

The Philippines was never connected to mainland Asia via land bridges, so the flora and fauna of the islands had to cross ocean straits to reach the Philippines. The Philippines is part of the Indomalayan realm, and its flora and fauna is mostly derived from tropical Asia. Botanically, the Philippines are part of Malesia, a floristic province that includes the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, and New Guinea. Most of the Malesian flora is derived from tropical Asia, including the dipterocarps, which are the characteristic tree of the Philippine forests. Elements of the Antarctic flora, which originated in the ancient southern hemisphere supercontinent of Gondwana, are also present, including ancient conifers like podocarps (&quot;Podocarpus, Nageia, Sundacarpus&quot;) and araucarias (&quot;Agathis&quot;).

The ecoregions of the Philippines are defined primarily by the sea levels during the Ice Ages, which were 120 meters lower than at present, as billions of gallons of water were locked away in huge continental ice sheets. This drop in sea level connected many presently separate islands into larger islands, which allowed for exchanges of flora and fauna:
* Greater Luzon included Luzon, Catanduanes, Marinduque, Polillo, and several small islands.
* Greater Mindanao included Mindanao, Basilan, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and adjacent small islands.
* Greater Palawan included Palawan, Balabac, Busuanga, Culion, Cuyo, and adjacent small islands.
* Greater Negros–Panay included Negros, Panay, Cebu, and Masbate.
* Greater Sulu included most of the Sulu Archipelago, from Tawi Tawi to Jolo.

These formerly-linked islands each constitute a separate ecoregion, as does Mindoro, which remained separate from the rest, along with a few smaller islands, notably Camiguin, Sibuyan, and Siquijor.

Each group of islands that were linked by land bridges in the ice ages also constitutes a separate faunal region. The lack of a land bridge to the Asian continent prevented most of the Asian megafauna, including elephants, rhinoceros, tapirs, tigers, leopards, and gibbons, from reaching the Philippines, although they do inhabit the adjacent Indonesian islands of Sundaland, which were formerly linked to the Asian continent by lowered sea levels.

The other main factor that defines the Philippine ecoregions is elevation; the high mountains of Luzon and Mindanao host distinct montane rain forest ecoregions. The mountains of Luzon are also home to the Luzon tropical pine forests.

<text>Moment in Peking is a novel originally written in English by Chinese author Lin Yutang. The novel, Lin&#x27;s first, covers the turbulent events in China from 1900 to 1938, including the Boxer Uprising, the Republican Revolution of 1911, the Warlord Era, the rise of nationalism and communism, and the start of the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945.

==Background==
At the repeated invitation of Pearl S. Buck, who had sponsored the publication of Lin&#x27;s bestselling &quot;My Country and My People&quot; in 1935, Lin left China for New York in August, 1936 to write &quot;The Importance of Living&quot;, which was published in August 1937 to even greater success just as war broke out in China. In 1938, Lin left New York to spend a year in Paris, where he wrote &quot;Moment in Peking&quot;.

Lin wrote the book in English for a U.S. audience, yet he based it in Chinese literature and philosophy. As an exercise, before he started to compose &quot;Moment in Peking&quot;, Lin translated passages from the classic Chinese novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, and followed its example in showing a spectrum of characters in their social settings and defining them through their clothing, jewelry, and footwear, and even by their language (dialect), geography (region), and foodways. Lin&#x27;s eldest daughter Lin Rusi also indicates in an introductory essay to a Chinese translation of &quot;Moment in Peking&quot; that the entire book was influenced by Zhuang Zi and its message was &quot;Life is but a dream.&quot;

Lin tries not to be overly judgemental of the characters because he recognizes that too many issues were involved in the chaotic years of early twentieth century China. There are no absolutely right or wrong characters. Each character held a piece of truth and reality and a piece of irrationality. In the preface, Lin writes that &quot;[This novel] is merely a story of... how certain habits of living and ways of thinking are formed and how, above all, [men and women] adjust themselves to the circumstances in this earthly life where men strive but gods rule.&quot;

While Lin does not display hatred toward the Japanese, he does let events and situations affect the novel&#x27;s characters to let the reader clearly see the reason the Chinese are still bitter about Japan&#x27;s military past. The novel ends with a cliffhanger, letting readers hope that the major characters who fled from the coastal regions to the inland of China would survive the horrible war. In the final pages of the book Lin observes: &quot;What an epic story was being lived through by these people of China... And it seemed to them that their own story was but a moment in old, ageless Peking, a story written by the finger of Time itself... In this moving mass of refugees, there was now neither rich nor poor.&quot;

The sequel, &quot;A Leaf in the Storm&quot;, published in 1941, does not follow the same characters, but takes up in 1937, at roughly the point in time when &quot;Moment in Peking&quot; leaves off.

==Main characters==
Many characters are from three wealthy families: Yao, Tseng (Zeng), and New (Niu), but characters from other families play an integral part in the story, such as Lifu, from the Kong family.

* Yao Mulan (姚木蘭)
The protagonist of the story, Mulan, is from the wealthy Yao family. During the Boxer Uprising many people left Peking and fled to other regions to avoid the turmoil and chaos of war. On the way to Hangchow she is separated from her family and then seized and sold to a human trafficking group, Fortunately the Tseng family track her down and buy (rescue) her. The two families become close friends and possible future in-laws. Mulan is lively, beautiful, intelligent and generous, as well as responsible. Her father has always encouraged her interests, among them her interest in &quot;oracle bones,&quot; which reveal ancient Chinese characters, and the singing of Chinese opera. Kung Lifu and his mother, Mrs.Kung are family friends of the Yaos. Both Mulan and Mochow have found Lifu to be deep, erudite, and virtuous: a promising future scholar and an interesting figure. Mulan is attracted to Lifu, but marriage and a romantic relationship had not crossed his mind. On the other hand, her reunion with her family seems so mysterious a circumstance, that on some level she feels that marriage with Sunya is fated. So with blessings from both families, she marries Sunya. Their marriage is mostly peaceful and harmonious. Together they have three children: Aman, Atung and Amei.

* Tseng Sunya (Zeng Sunya, 曾蓀亞)
Mulan&#x27;s husband, Tseng Sunya, is affectionately called &quot;Fatty&quot; by Mulan. As the youngest son of his family, Sunya is arguably the least responsible one, but has what is called a &quot;round character&quot;.

* Hongyu (紅玉)
Mulan, Mochow, and Afei&#x27;s cousin. She is madly in love with Afei, and admires the famous character Lin Daiyu from the classic novel Dream of the Red Chamber (紅樓夢). When she misunderstands a conversation and thinks that Afei doesn&#x27;t love her, she drowns herself, or so it seems. She dies in vain, leaving her parents devastated. Her death provides a reflection on the Yaos: ill-mannered, irresponsible, negligent. The so-called blood-ties are so weak when it comes to real commitment.

== Reception and influence ==

&quot;Time magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;Moment in Peking&quot; is &quot;modeled exactly on traditional Chinese novels,&quot; which are among the world&#x27;s longest, oldest, and most thickly populated with characters. The novel, &quot;far superior to Author Lin&#x27;s whimsical &quot;The Importance of Living&quot;, may well become the classic background novel of modern China.&quot; The magazine named it as one of nine novels that were &quot;Books of the Year&quot; in 1939. Others included &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; by James Joyce and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; by John Steinbeck.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote that &quot;Mr. Lin has filled some 800 pages with a picturesque and leisurely account of how contemporary China grew and learned to live and adjusted itself to the fact, as he says in a preface, that &#x27;men strive but the gods rule.&#x27;&quot; The old has given way to the new, the review goes on, but Lin does not try to say which is right or wrong. &quot;By Western standards it is a somewhat formless record, not always easy to follow,&quot; but &quot;by any standards it has strength, tolerance, humor, color, and dignity.&quot; The reader should see why, he concludes, Pearl Buck has called in &quot;the great novel of modern China.&quot; 

The scholar Zuzana Dudasova, writing in 2019, called &quot;Moment In Peking&quot; a &quot;great novel&quot;, and went on to compare how Lin used the Daoist, Confucian, and popular elements with Pearl Buck&#x27;s use of them in &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. In each, the author uses a distinctively Chinese worldview to give depth and metaphorical meanings to the story.

==Chinese translations==
Lin originally wanted the poet Yu Dafu to do the Chinese translation, but Yu had only completed the first section when he was killed by the Japanese in World War II. Lin did not particularly like the first complete Chinese translation, which was done by 1941.

In 1977 Zhang Zhenyu, a translator from Taiwan, created what is the most popular translation today, titled Jinghua Yanyun (). It was not available in mainland China until a publisher in Jilin issued a sanitized version in 1987. The current political climate permits Shaanxi Normal University Press to publish the full translation. Yu Dafu&#x27;s son Yu Fei (郁飛) finished his own translation in 1991, but his version, titled Shunxi Jinghua (), is not widely read.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted three times into a television drama, including a 1988 adaptation starring Angie Chiu, a 2005 adaptation starring Zhao Wei, and a 2014 adaptation starring Li Sheng.

<doc id="958313" wikidata="Q3755441" url="?curid=958313" title="West Cork">
<text>West Cork () is a tourist region and municipal district in County Cork, Ireland. As a municipal district, West Cork falls within the administrative area of Cork County Council, and includes the towns of Bantry, Castletownbere, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Schull and Skibbereen, and the &#x27;key villages&#x27; of Baltimore, Ballydehob, Courtmacsherry, Drimoleague, Durrus, Glengarriff, Leap, Rosscarbery, Timoleague and Union Hall.

The westernmost part of the region consists of three main peninsulas: Beara, Sheep&#x27;s Head and Mizen Head. Islands which lie off West Cork include Bere Island, Sherkin Island and Cape Clear.

== History and administration ==

The area&#x27;s pre-history is evident in the many Iron Age burial monuments, including a large number of megalithic tombs, dolmens, standing stones and stone circles.

West Cork has had a distinct identity from at least the ancient Dáirine kingdom of Corcu Loígde which once covered much of the area. The historic baronies of Carbery, the largest barony in Ireland down to the nineteenth-century, Bantry, and Bear, or Bere, on Beara Peninsula, existed down from the Middle Ages. A series of coastal islands, on the coast of the baronies of Carbery West and Carbery East, are known as Carbery&#x27;s Hundred Isles.

A Spanish expedition made landfall on the coast in October 1601 attempting to link up with Irish rebels. This ended with the Battle of Kinsale - described as &quot;one of the decisive battles of the world&#x27;s history. If the Irish had won that battle—and they could have won it—...England&#x27;s power was shattered&quot;. In the early 17th century, the townland of Leamcon (near Schull was a pirate stronghold, and pirates traded easily in Baltimore and Whiddy Island.

During the mid-19th century, parts of West Cork were severely impacted by the Great Famine.

Within the Catholic Church in Ireland and the Church of Ireland (Anglican) traditions, the coastal area from Ballydehob to Timoleague was formerly contained within the Dioceses of Ross. These dioceses no longer exist separately, and now form part of the larger Roman Catholic Diocese of Cork and Ross and the Church of Ireland Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross respectively.

As of the 21st century, West Cork is a municipal district within the administrative area of Cork County Council. The district is represented by 9 councillors, and the West Cork Municipal District Office is in Clonakilty.

== Geography==
The region&#x27;s western terrain was formed between 360 and 374 million years ago, as part of the rising of the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks and Caha Mountains mountains ranges. This occurred during the Devonian period when Ireland was part of a larger continental landmass and located south of the equator. There are three main peninsulas on this side of the region: Beara, Sheep&#x27;s Head and Mizen Head.

Towns in West Cork include Ballydehob, Bandon, Bantry, Castletownbere, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Rosscarbery, Schull, and Skibbereen.

==Transport==
The area was linked in 1849 by the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway, sometimes known as the West Cork Railway. This railway line began in Cork City, travelled across the county and had branches to Clonakilty (junction at Gaggin) and Skibbereen (junction at Drimoleague), before terminating at Bantry. It closed in 1961. The narrow-gauge Schull and Skibbereen Railway opened in 1886 and closed in 1947.

The main infrastructural backbone is provided by the N71 and R586 routes.

==Tourism==
Traditionally a tourist destination, the West Cork area is marketed to tourists for its remote peninsulas (such as the Beara Peninsula, Sheep&#x27;s Head and Mizen Head peninsulas), beaches such as Inchydoney, Owenahincha and Barleycove, and towns and villages such as Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Kinsale and Rosscarbery. For tourism purposes, the area of West Cork is not strictly defined, but at its broadest definition it includes all parts of County Cork south and west of the River Lee with the exception of Cork city and suburbs. Road signs may be found around Cork city and elsewhere directing traffic for &quot;The West&quot; or &quot;West Cork&quot;.

The Wild Atlantic Way tourist route spans much of the West Cork coast, including the Old Head of Kinsale, Dursey Island and Mizen Head.

<doc id="958327" wikidata="Q2700739" url="?curid=958327" title="Underwoodisaurus milii">
<text>Underwoodisaurus milii is a species of gecko, a lizard in the family Carphodactylidae. The species is commonly known as the thick-tailed or barking gecko, referring to its distinctive plump tail and sharp, barking defensive call. The genus is also often called thick-tailed geckos as a group, along with the species &quot;Uvidicolus sphyrurus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The specific name, &quot;milii&quot;, is in honor of French sailor and naturalist Pierre Bernard Milius.

==Description==
&quot;U. milii&quot; is reddish-brown with bands of white and yellow spots, and a paler underbelly. It usually grows to a total length (including tail) of . The original tail is black with several pale bands; however, the regenerated tail has little pattern.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;U. milii&quot; is found in southern regions of Australia. Its distribution in Western Australia is throughout the southwest, the goldfields, wheatbelt, and Nullarbor regions to the east, and to Shark Bay in the north. It is also found at the Houtman Abrolhos and the Archipelago of the Recherche. &quot;U. milii&quot; is found in rocky outcrops and is slightly more cold-tolerant than many other Australian gecko species. It is nocturnal, and shelters underneath rocks or in burrows during the day.

==Diet==
&quot;U. milii&quot; feeds on insects and small vertebrates.

==Behaviour==
Unusually for reptiles, &quot;U. milii&quot; forms aggregations in its retreat sites during the day. The reasons for this are unknown. However, it has been shown that this behavior results in a higher aggregate thermal inertia (they stay warmer) than would be found in solitary geckos of this and related kinds in similar circumstances. In the same source, it was suggested that aggregating for physiological benefits may precede the development of other kinds of social behavior.

When threatened, &quot;U. milii&quot; will arch its back and &quot;bark&quot;. It also does this in breeding season. This species, and some other species of geckos have the unusual habit of licking their eyes after eating, presumably to keep the eyeshield clean.

==Conservation status==
The species &quot;U. milii&quot; has been assessed by the IUCN Red List and is listed as Least Concern. It has not been assessed by the Australian EPBC Act and may be kept as a pet with the appropriate license in at least some states of Australia.

<doc id="958349" wikidata="Q503457" url="?curid=958349" title="Bob Brown (offensive lineman)">
<text>Robert Stanford Brown (December 8, 1941 – June 16, 2023), nicknamed &quot;the Boomer&quot;, was an American professional football offensive tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1964 through 1973. He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, earning unanimous All-American honors. Brown was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles as the second overall pick in the 1964 NFL draft. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, he played for the Eagles from 1964 to 1968, the Los Angeles Rams from 1969 to 1970, and the Oakland Raiders from 1971 to 1973. Brown was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Early life and college==
Brown was born on December 8, 1941, in Cleveland, Ohio, where he later attended East Technical High School.

At the University of Nebraska, Brown was a backup as an offensive lineman and outside linebacker in Bill Jennings&#x27; final season as the Cornhuskers&#x27; coach in 1961. Brown became a starter in 1962 under coach Bob Devaney. Brown preserved a 36–34 win in the 1962 Gotham Bowl, the program&#x27;s first bowl win, with an interception in the final minute. As a senior in 1963, he was a unanimous All-American selection at guard, helping Nebraska win their first conference championship since 1940. The Cornhuskers&#x27; first Black All-American, Brown was voted the offensive lineman of the year by the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club. He also earned his second consecutive all-conference selection in the Big Eight.

==Professional career==
Brown was selected in the first round of the 1964 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles with the second overall pick. The contract he signed with the team had a $100,000 signing bonus. After his rookie season in 1964, Brown was named to the NFL All-Rookie team and earned second-team All-Pro honors. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 1965 and 1966 during his five-season career with the Eagles.

After asking for a trade from the Eagles, Brown was sent to the Los Angeles Rams in a five-player exchange on May 12, 1969. The Eagles traded Brown, along with cornerback Jim Nettles, to the Rams in exchange for offensive tackle Joe Carollo, guard Don Chuy, and defensive back Irv Cross.

Brown was traded by the Rams to the Oakland Raiders, along with two draft picks, in exchange for offensive tackle Harry Schuh and cornerback Kent McCloughan on June 23, 1971. He played three seasons for the Raiders, teaming on the offensive line with fellow future Pro Football Hall of Famers Art Shell, Gene Upshaw, and Jim Otto. During the 1971 season, another eventual Hall of Famer, Ron Mix played his final pro season as Brown&#x27;s backup at right tackle. Hall of Fame Kansas City Chief middle linebacker Willie Lanier had particular respect for Brown, among all the great offensive lineman that played for the Oakland Raiders.

Brown was named a first-team All-Pro during five of his ten NFL seasons. Named the NFL/NFC offensive lineman of the year three times, Brown was also selected to the Pro Bowl six times: thrice with the Eagles, twice with the Rams, and once with the Raiders.

==Awards and honors==
In 1993, Brown was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. A member of the NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004. Brown&#x27;s No. 64 was retired by the University of Nebraska in 2004.

==Personal life and death==
Brown was married to Cecelia and had a son, Robert Jr. His son was his presenter at his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
Brown had a stroke in April 2023. Afterwards, he lived in a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California, where he died on June 16, 2023, at the age of 81.

<text>Rayo Vallecano de Madrid, S.A.D. (), often abbreviated to Rayo (Spanish for &quot;thunderbolt&quot;), is a Spanish professional football club based in the Villa de Vallecas district of Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.

Founded on 29 May 1924, the club is known for its sociocultural tradition, recognized for representing the barrio-local culture and its working-class status. Its home matches have been played at the 14,708-capacity Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas stadium since 1976.

During its history, Rayo has spent 19 seasons in the top-flight, and has played in one European competition, the UEFA Cup in the 2000–01 season. The club won the 2017–18 Segunda División. By historical performance, Rayo is the third best club in Community of Madrid, after Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid.

==History==
===Establishment and early years===
Rayo Vallecano was founded on 29 May 1924 in the hometown of Prudencia Priego, wife of the club&#x27;s first president Julián Huerta. Greatly inspired by River Plate (a Football club from Argentina), in 1949, after an agreement with Atlético Madrid, a red diagonal stripe was added to the team&#x27;s kit, and the club reached Tercera División for the first time in its history.

===Yo-yo years===
One of the perennial yo-yo clubs of Spanish football, and always in the shadow of the two biggest clubs in the city (Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid), Rayo Vallecano spent many years during the 1980s and 1990s moving back and forth between La Liga and Segunda División. The 1983–84 season was the worst during the 1980s. The club finished in the last position in Segunda División and was relegated to Segunda División B.

Due to a tragedy Rayo Vallecano turned out to be Laurie Cunningham&#x27;s last club; he was killed in a car crash just outside Madrid in 1989, after a sole season. He had recently won an F.A. Cup winners medal with Wimbledon F.C. in England the previous year and had also represented neighbours Real Madrid for four years.

They appeared to have consolidated their top flight status after gaining promotion in 1999, and the team&#x27;s most successful season came in 2000–01 when they reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, going out only to eventual runners-up Alavés; Rayo finished ninth in the previous campaign, but entered the competition via the fair play draw.

===2003–11: Segunda División and below===

However, the club shortly thereafter fell on hard times, enduring successive relegations in 2003 and 2004. For 2005–06 manager Míchel, a Real Madrid legend in the 1980s and &#x27;90s, was hired.

Rayo finished the 2006–07 season in second place in Segunda División B, winning the promotion play-off semifinal but losing in the final to Eibar (1–2 aggregate). The following campaign, the team returned to division two after a four-year absence after a victorious run in the playoffs, disposing of Benidorm in the semi-final and Zamora in the last game 2–1 on aggregate.

In its first seasons back in the second tier of Spanish football, Rayo finished comfortably, often either in or just outside the promotion places. In 2010–11, the team ranked in second position and returned to the top flight after an eight-year absence, only trailing champions Real Betis in spite of very serious economic problems.

===2011–: La Liga and Segunda División yo-yo===
In March 2014, Huawei agreed to sponsor Rayo Vallecano for two league matches against Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao.

In August 2015, Rayo Vallecano purchased the majority of Oklahoma City FC, a NASL expansion franchise which had yet to officially play a game renaming the club to Rayo OKC, despite the stadium increasingly needing work. It was the first ever entry of a Spanish club into the American sports market and mirrored a 2013 sponsorship agreement with Qbao in terms of expanding the club&#x27;s profile overseas. Rayo OKC folded after a year due to Rayo Vallecano&#x27;s relegation from La Liga and a dispute between the co-owners led to less finance for the U.S. side.

In May 2016, Rayo Vallecano were relegated to the Segunda División, finishing 18th in the 2015–16 La Liga season. This ended their five-year streak in La Liga, their longest ever stay in the top-flight. Their first season back in the second division was a poor one, with both problems on the field and off, and they finished in 12th position. Rayo went through three managers in the 2016–17 Segunda División season before finally settling on club legend Míchel. He revived the club from the relegation places to 12th, almost making the playoffs.

At the start of the 2017–18 Segunda División season, the club appointed their recently retired goalkeeper David Cobeño as the sporting director of the club. They secured their promotion with a 1–0 over CD Lugo with one game remaining. That season the club won Segunda División with 76 points in 42 games.
On 20 March 2019, the club appointed Paco Jémez as head coach, and on 4 May, Rayo was relegated back to the Segunda División after losing 4–1 to Levante UD, eventually finishing last.

In August 2020, the club appointed Andoni Iraola as head coach. They finished sixth and won promotion in the playoffs against Girona FC; despite losing the first leg at home 1–2, the team came back to win the second leg 2–0 away to claim a place in La Liga for 2021–22. In February 2022, Iraola&#x27;s side defeated RCD Mallorca to make the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey; it was the second time in club history and first since 1982. The club finished 12th in La Liga. This was a big achievement as they were by far the league&#x27;s smallest team, and most had predicted that they would be relegated.

==Stadium==

Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas is a football stadium located on Calle Payaso Fofó 1, Vallecas. Opened on 10 May 1976, at first it was called &quot;New Stadium Vallecas&quot;, but in January 2004, 13 years after the arrival of the Ruiz-Mateos family in 1991, it changed denominations, as the wife was also named by her husband, businessman José María, the first woman president of an elite football team.

It has a capacity of 14,708 spectators in an all-seated format and dimensions of 100×67 m. after the enlargement of the width and the reduction of the length of the pitch after the remodelling of the grandstands, compulsory due to the elimination of the fences surrounding the pitch. The pitch is one the smallest in La Liga. Additionally, one of the goal ends does not have a grandstand, just a big wall with information panels.

In June 2009, the club announced plans for the construction of a new stadium. Nevertheless, the Autonomous Community of Madrid, owner of the stadium, has not any plan as far as it is known in 2023.

==Club culture and supporters==
The fans do not have a good relationship with the current owner Raúl Martín Presa and regularly chant for him to leave.

In late March 2012, in support of the 2011–12 Spanish protests, the squad decided to take one day off from training to join the demonstrations. In 2014, 85-year-old Vallecas resident Carmen Martínez Ayuso was evicted from her house after living there since the 1960s. Rayo Vallecano and particularly coach Paco Jémez were touched by her story, and subsequently offered to fund Martínez for the foreseeable future.

In February 2017, Ukrainian player Roman Zozulya left the club after one training session due to chants of &quot;Nazi&quot; by Rayo fans accusing him of belonging to far-right groups; Zozulya denied ever belonging to any far-right groups, and immediately returned to his parent club Real Betis. In 2019, when Zozulya was playing for Albacete, a match was called off at half-time after fans once again sang &quot;Zozulya you are a Nazi&quot;.

== Anthems and songs==
Although most people recognise the supporting songs by ska-punk band Ska-P (&quot;Rayo Vallecano&quot; and &quot;Como un rayo&quot;), Rayo Vallecano has an official anthem which played at their home stadium before matches.

The club is also known for chanting the song &quot;La Vida Pirata&quot; (), a song about pirates, which the &quot;Bukaneros&quot; are named after.

Spanish:

&quot;La vida pirata es la vida mejor (bis)&quot;

&quot;sin trabajar (bis)&quot;

&quot;Sin estudiar (bis)&quot;

&quot;Con la botella de ron (bis)&quot;

&quot;Soy capitán (bis)&quot;

&quot;del Santa Inés (bis)&quot;

&quot;Y en cada puerto tengo una mujer (bis)&quot;

&quot;La rubia es (bis)&quot;

&quot;Fenomenal (bis)&quot;

&quot;Y la morena tampoco esta mal (bis)&quot;

&quot;Las inglesas con su seriedad (bis)&quot;

&quot;Y las francesas que todo lo dan (bis)&quot;

&quot;Si alguna vez (bis)&quot;

&quot;Me he de casar (bis)&quot;

&quot;Me he de casar (bis)&quot;

&quot;Con la del Rayo, una, una y nada más (bis).&quot;

English:

&quot;&quot;The pirate life is the best life (bis)&quot;

&quot;without working (bis)&quot;

&quot;without studying (bis)&quot;

&quot;With the bottle of rum (bis)&quot;

&quot;I am captain (bis)&quot;

&quot;of the &quot;Santa Inés&quot;&#x27; (bis)&quot;

&quot;and in each port, I have a woman (bis) &quot;

&quot;the blonde is (bis)&quot;
&quot;phenomenal (bis)&quot;

&quot;and the brunette is not bad either (bis)&quot;

&quot;The English women with their seriousness (bis)&quot;

&quot;And the French women who give everything (bis)&quot;

&quot;If ever (bis)&quot;

&quot;I have to marry (bis) &quot;

&quot;I have to marry (bis)&quot;

&quot;with the one of Rayo, one, one and no more (bis)&quot;&quot;

<doc id="958376" wikidata="Q1701838" url="?curid=958376" title="John S. McDiarmid">
<text>John Stewart McDiarmid (December 25, 1882 – June 7, 1965) was a Manitoba politician. He held senior ministerial positions in the governments of John Bracken, Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell, and served as the province&#x27;s 14th Lieutenant Governor between 1953 and 1960.

== Biography ==
McDiarmid was born in Perthshire, Scotland, and emigrated to Canada with his family in 1887. He was educated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and hired by the Winnipeg Paint and Glass Co. upon its formation in 1902. He later worked his way up to president of the McDiarmid Brothers Lumber Company, which was also located in the city. In 1925, he was elected as an alderman on Winnipeg&#x27;s municipal council. He represented the city&#x27;s first ward, located in south Winnipeg.

The following year, McDiarmid was elected to the federal House of Commons as a Liberal, in the riding of Winnipeg South. He defeated his only opponent, Conservative Robert Rogers, by 8809 votes to 7638. For the next four years, he served in parliament as a backbench supporter of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. He was defeated by Rogers in a 1930 rematch, 10117 votes to 9774.

On May 27, 1932, McDiarmid was appointed Provincial Lands Commissioner and Minister of Mines and Natural Resources in the government of provincial Premier John Bracken. This occurred after negotiations in which the provincial Liberal party merged with Bracken&#x27;s governing Progressives; McDiarmid received one of the cabinet positions designated for the Liberal Party.

In the 1932 election held less than a month later, McDiarmid was elected to the provincial assembly in the constituency of Winnipeg. He was the most popular candidate of his party in the city-wide district. (Winnipeg elected ten members by STV at the time).

Provincial Liberal leader Murdoch Mackay was not elected in the 1932 election, and McDiarmid was recognized as the leading Liberal spokesman in the &quot;Liberal-Progressive&quot; coalition. He was not formally recognized as a party leader, as the Liberals were no longer an autonomous entity.

Ideologically, McDiarmid appears to have been on the right wing of his party. One-time Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leader Lloyd Stinson described him as the most right-wing member of the Liberal-Progressive government, and also accused him of being anti-labour. McDiarmid was re-elected in Winnipeg in 1936, finishing fifth in the city voters&#x27; first preferences.

In the election 1941, held after the creation of a grand coalition ministry with the Conservatives, CCF and Social Credit, he was the most popular candidate in the first preferences.

McDiarmid retained the Land and Natural Resources/Mines portfolios for the entirety of his time in cabinet, and was also Provincial Secretary from November 28, 1939, to February 14, 1946, Railway Commissioner and Minister of Industry and Commerce from November 4, 1940, to June 30, 1953, and (briefly) acting Labour Minister following the resignation of CCF leader Seymour Farmer in 1942. During his time in cabinet, McDiarmid was responsible for legislation opening northern Manitoba&#x27;s mine fields to development. He died in 1965.

McDiarmid was second in the first count of Winnipeg votes in the general election of 1945 and was elected, after Seymour Farmer.

He was the most popular candidate again in 1949 when he ran in the new four-member district of Winnipeg South. He was elected.

McDiarmid announced his retirement from politics in 1953, and formally resigned from cabinet on June 30 of that year.

Following a period of intense media speculation, McDiarmid was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba on August 1 of the same year. He served in this largely ceremonial position until January 15, 1960, when he was replaced by former Progressive Conservative party leader Errick Willis.

McDiarmid died in his Winnipeg home at age 82 in 1965 after a long illness.

<doc id="958383" wikidata="Q5290198" url="?curid=958383" title="Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration">
<text>The domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration was the domestic policy of the United States from 2001 to 2009 while George W. Bush was president. Bush&#x27;s main domestic policy advisors include Chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs Edward Lazear, Rob Portman, director of the Office of Management and Budget; U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, Vice President Dick Cheney; U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson; U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael O. Leavitt and Allan Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council.

Some of George W. Bush&#x27;s biggest domestic policy achievements include winning passage for two major tax cuts during his term in office: the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the &quot;Bush tax cuts&quot;.

== Law enforcement and justice ==
=== Surveillance and homeland security ===
On October 26, 2001, Bush signed into law the Patriot Act. Passed on the president&#x27;s request, the act permitted increased sharing of intelligence among the U.S. Intelligence Community and expanded the government&#x27;s domestic authority to conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists. The Patriot Act also authorized the use of roving wiretaps on suspected terrorists and expanded the government&#x27;s authority to conduct surveillance of suspected &quot;lone wolf&quot; terrorists. Bush also secretly authorized the National Security Agency to conduct warrantless surveillance of communications in and out of the United States.

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Bush announced the creation of the Office of Homeland Security and appointed former governor of Pennsylvania Tom Ridge its director. After Congress passed the Homeland Security Act signed into law by President Bush on November 25, 2002, to create the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Ridge became the first director of the newly created department. The department was charged with overseeing immigration, border control, customs, and the newly established Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which focused on airport security. Though the FBI and CIA remained independent agencies, the DHS was assigned jurisdiction over the Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (which was divided into three agencies), the United States Customs Service (which was also divided into separate agencies), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Homeland Security Act represented the most significant departmental reorganization since the National Security Act of 1947.

=== Capital punishment ===
George W. Bush is a strong supporter of capital punishment. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were executed in that state, maintaining its record as the leading state in executions. As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Although Bush&#x27;s support of the death penalty is known, controversy broke in 1999 when journalist Tucker Carlson revealed that the Governor had mocked the plight of Karla Faye Tucker in an interview.

=== Amber Alert ===
Bush signed the Amber Alert legislation into law on April 30, 2003, which was developed to quickly alert the general public about child abductions using various media sources. On July 27, 2006, Bush signed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act which establishes a national database requiring all convicted sex offenders to register their current residency and related details on a monthly instead of the previous yearly basis. Newly convicted sex offenders will also face longer mandatory incarceration periods.

=== Prison rape ===
The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA) is the first United States federal law passed dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law by President Bush on September 4, 2003. As a result, the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission was created to study the problem and recommend solutions. Federal funding for prisons also began to require detainment facilities to keep records on sexual assault. Failure to follow PREA requirements resulted in losing up to 5% of funding. New grants to prevent sexual assault were also created by the law. Significant support for the act came from Human Rights Watch, Concerned Women for America, Just Detention International, and numerous evangelical organizations.

== Science ==
On December 19, 2002, Bush signed into law H. R. 4664, far-reaching legislation to put the National Science Foundation (NSF) on a track to double its budget over five years and to create new mathematics and science education initiatives at both the pre-college and undergraduate level. In the first three years of those five, the R&amp;D budget increased by fourteen percent. Bush had long been dogged by criticism that his administration ignored or suppressed scientific advice. Bush showed support for oceanography and space exploration; and supported sciences on reducing pollution. Bush generally was opposed to biology, especially the science of human reproduction and reproductive health. Bush supported &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot;. Bush&#x27;s positions were not always shared by his party.

=== Stem cell research ===
President Bush supported adult stem cell research and umbilical cord blood stem cell research. However, Bush opposed any new embryonic stem cell research, and had limited the federal funding of existing research. Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research was first approved under President Clinton on January 19, 1999, but no money was to be spent until the guidelines were published. The guidelines were released under Clinton on August 23, 2000. They allowed use of unused frozen embryos. On August 9, 2001, before any funding was granted under these guidelines, Bush announced modifications to the guidelines to allow use of only existing stem cell lines. While Bush claimed that more than 60 embryonic stem cell lines already existed from privately funded research, scientists in 2003 said there were only 11 usable lines, and in 2005 that all lines approved for Federal funding are contaminated and unusable. Adult stem cell funding was not restricted and was supported by President Bush as a more viable means of research.

On July 19, 2006, Bush vetoed a bill on stem cell research.

On June 20, 2007, Bush vetoed a stem cell bill again.

=== Space exploration ===

On January 14, 2004, Bush announced a Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the completion of the International Space Station by 2010 and the retirement of the Space Shuttle while developing a new spacecraft called the Crew Exploration Vehicle under the title Project Constellation. The CEV would be used to return American astronauts to the Moon by 2018, with the objective of establishing a permanent lunar base, and eventually sending future manned missions to Mars. To this end, the plan proposes that NASA&#x27;s budget increase by five percent every year until it is capped at US$18 billion in 2008, with only inflationary increases thereafter. The planned retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2010 after the ISS is completed is also expected to free up US$5 billion to US$6 billion a year. The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign. Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections.

Supporters believe that this plan will be an important part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding over the next five years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA&#x27;s other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.

In January 2005, the White House released a new Space Transportation Policy fact sheet which outlined the administration&#x27;s space policy in broad terms and tied the development of space transport capabilities to national security requirements.

In December 2003, Bush signed legislation implementing key provisions of his Healthy Forests Initiative. Another subject of controversy is Bush&#x27;s Clear Skies Initiative, which seeks to reduce air pollution through expansion of emissions trading.

Bush signed the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 authorizing the federal government to begin cleaning up pollution and contaminated sediment in the Great Lakes, as well as the Brownfields Legislation in 2002, accelerating the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites, or brownfields, to better protect public health, create jobs, and revitalize communities.

Bush stated his reason for not supporting the Kyoto Protocol was that it unfairly targeted the United States while being deliberately lenient with certain developing countries, especially China and India. Bush stated, &quot;The world&#x27;s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases is China. Yet, China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.&quot;

Bush also questioned the science behind the global warming phenomenon, insisting that more research be done to determine its validity.
==== Hurricane Katrina ====

Hurricane Katrina struck early in Bush&#x27;s second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.

Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27 and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day. He authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.
On August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it &quot;an incident of national significance&quot;, triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans. The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was &quot;not enough&quot;.

As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration&#x27;s role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government&#x27;s failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.

==== Global warming ====

Upon arriving in office in 2001, President Bush withdrew United States support of the then-pending Kyoto Protocol, a UN Convention seeking to impose mandatory targets for reducing &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; emissions. Bush stated that human activity had not been proven to be the cause and cited concerns about the treaty&#x27;s impact on the U.S. economy and pointed out that China and India had not signed on. The Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005. As of September 2011, 191 states have signed and ratified the protocol. The only remaining signatory not to have ratified the protocol is the United States.

In 2002, the Bush Administration&#x27;s EPA issued a Climate Action Report concluding that the climate changes observed over several decades &quot;are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability&quot;. While the EPA report was initially hailed by some environmentalists critical of the Bush administration as a &quot;180-degree turn on the science&quot; reversing &quot;everything the president has said about global warming since he took office,&quot; within days President Bush dismissed the report as being &quot;put out by the bureaucracy,&quot; and reaffirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol.

The Bush Administration&#x27;s stance on global warming, and in particular its questioning the consensus of scientists, would remain controversial in the scientific and environmental communities during his presidency. In 2004, the Director of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute, James E. Hansen, came out publicly and harshly accusing the administration of misinforming the public by suppressing the scientific evidence of the dangers of greenhouse gases, saying the Bush administration wanted to hear only scientific results that &quot;fit predetermined, inflexible positions&quot; and edited reports to make the dangers sound less threatening in what he asserted was &quot;direct opposition to the most fundamental precepts of science.&quot; Other experts, such as former U.S. Department of Energy official Joseph Romm, have decried the Bush administration as a &quot;denier and delayer&quot; of government action essential to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.

In 2005, Council on Environmental Quality chairman and former oil industry lobbyist Philip Cooney, was accused of doctoring and watering down descriptions of climate research from other government agencies. The White House denied these reports. Two days later, Cooney announced his resignation and conceded his role in altering the reports. &quot;My sole loyalty was to the President and advancing the policies of his administration,&quot; he told the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In addition, the administration thanked Exxon executives for the company&#x27;s &quot;active involvement&quot; in helping to determine climate change policy, including the US stance on Kyoto.

President Bush believes that global warming is real and has said that he has consistently noted that global warming is a serious problem but asserted there is a &quot;debate over whether it&#x27;s manmade or naturally caused&quot; and maintained that regardless of that debate his administration was working on plans to make America less dependent on foreign oil &quot;for economic and national security reasons.&quot;

The United States has signed the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, a pact that allows signatory countries to set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions individually, but with no enforcement mechanism. Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with 187 mayors from US towns and cities, have pledged to adopt Kyoto style legal limits on greenhouse gas emissions.

==== Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ====
For economic and national security reasons, Bush supported Alaska Senator Ted Stevens&#x27; plan to tap the oil reserves in a area of Alaska&#x27;s 19 million acre (77,000 km2) Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Pro-exploration supporters argue that U.S. companies have the most stringent environmental requirements, and that by doing the drilling in the middle of the winter, it would create a very small environmental footprint.

Opponents stated that drilling would damage the coastal plain&#x27;s fragile ecosystem and its wildlife. Proponents stated that modern techniques can extract the oil without damaging the environment

==== The Clear Skies Act of 2003 ====
Initially announced by President Bush in 2002, the Clear Skies Initiative was aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to further reduce air pollution and expanded the emissions trading programs to include new pollutants such as mercury. The goal of the initiative was to reduce the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury emissions of power plants over the course of 15 years, while saving consumers millions of dollars.

Among other things, the Clear Skies Act states that it would:
* Cut mercury emissions by 69 percent, – the first-ever national cap on mercury emissions. Emissions will be cut from current emissions of 48 tons to a cap of 26 tons in 2010, and 15 tons in 2018.
* Cut emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) by 67 percent, from emissions of 5 million tons to a cap of 2.1 million tons in 2008, and to 1.7 million tons in 2018
* Cut sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 73 percent, from emissions of 11 million tons to a cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010, and 3 million tons in 2018.
* Emission caps will be set to account for different air quality needs in the East and the West.
* Section 483 of the Bill exempt some older building from many of the provisions of the Bill, but must still meet carbon monoxide standards.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, and its more than 500,000 members, examined the administration proposal and concluded it would harm public health, weaken current pollution fighting programs and worsen global warming. S. 385, the administration&#x27;s bill to amend the Clean Air Act would:
1. Allow power plant pollution to continue to inflict huge, avoidable health damages on the public. 
2. Repeal or interfere with major health and air quality safeguards in current law. 
3. Worsen global warming by ignoring CO2 emissions from the power sector.

==== Energy ====
In 2005–2006, Bush emphasized the need for comprehensive energy reform and proposed increased funding for research and development of alternative sources of energy such as hydrogen power, nuclear power, ethanol, and clean coal technologies. Bush proposed the American Competitiveness Initiative which seeks to support increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy, with greater development of advanced technologies, as well as greater education and support for American students.

In his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, &quot;America is addicted to oil&quot; and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research.

In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, &quot;This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.&quot; Bush had said in June 2008, &quot;In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.&quot;

In his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, &quot;Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.&quot; He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States&#x27; commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, &quot;This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.&quot;

==== National preserves ====
On June 15, 2006, Bush created the seventy-fifth, and largest, National Monument in U.S. history and the largest Marine Protected Area in the world with the formation of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument.

== Economy ==
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the economy suffered from a recession that lasted from March 2001 to November 2001. During the Bush Administration, Real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5%.

Inflation under Bush has remained near historic lows at about 2–3% per year. The recession and a drop in some prices led to concern about deflation from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, high oil prices have caused concern about increasing inflation.

Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits. Under the Bush administration, productivity has grown by an average of 3.76% per year, the highest such average in ten years.

While the GDP recovered from a recession that some claim Bush inherited from the previous administration, poverty has since worsened according to the Census Bureau. The percentage of the population below the poverty level increased in each of Bush&#x27;s first four years, while it decreased for each of the prior seven years to an 11-year low. Although the poverty level increased the increase was still lower from 2000 to 2002 than it was from 1992 to 1997, which reached a peak of 39.3% in 1993. In 2002 the poverty rate was 34.6% which was almost equal to the rate in 1998, which was 34.5%. Poverty was at 12.7% in 2004.

=== Taxes ===
President Bush won passage for two major tax cuts during his term in office: The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the &quot;Bush tax cuts&quot;.

The cuts, scheduled to expire a decade after passage, increased the standard income tax deduction for married couples, eliminated the estate tax, and reduced marginal tax rates. Bush asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, but others wanted the cuts to be wholly or partially repealed even before their scheduled expiration, seeing the decrease in revenue while increasing spending as fiscally irresponsible.

Bush&#x27;s supporters claim that the tax cuts increase the pace of economic recovery and job creation. They also claim that total benefits to wealthier individuals are a reflection of higher taxes paid. Individual income tax rate provisions in the 2001 law, for instance, created larger marginal tax rate decreases for people earning less than US$12,000 than any other earners.
His opponents contest job prediction claims, primarily noting that the increase in job creation predicted by Bush&#x27;s plan failed to materialize. They instead allege that the purpose of the tax cuts was intended to favor the wealthy and special interests, as the majority of benefit from the tax cut, in absolute terms, went to earners in the higher tax brackets. Bush&#x27;s opponents additionally claim that the tax cuts are a major reason Bush reversed a national surplus into a historically large deficit.

In an open letter to Bush in 2004, more than 100 professors of business and economics at U.S. business schools ascribed this &quot;fiscal reversal&quot; to Bush&#x27;s &quot;policy of slashing taxes – primarily for those at the upper reaches of the income distribution.&quot;

By 2004, these cuts had reduced federal tax revenues, as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, to the lowest level since 1959. With the NASDAQ crash and one quarter of negative growth in 2000 it was likely we were headed into a recession, yet merely two years after the 2003 Bush tax cuts, federal revenues (in dollars) had reached a record high. The effect of simultaneous record increases in spending and tax reductions was to create record budget deficits in absolute terms, though as recently as 1993, the deficit was slightly larger than the current 3.6% of the GDP. In the last year of the Clinton administration, the federal budget showed an annual surplus of more than US$230 billion. Under Bush, the government returned to deficit spending. The annual deficit reached an absolute record of US$374 billion in 2003 and then a further record of $413 billion in 2004.

=== Spending ===
President Bush expanded public spending by 70 percent, more than double the increase under President Clinton. Bush was the first president in 176 years to continue an entire term without vetoing any legislation.

The tax cuts, recession, and increases in outlays all contributed to record budget deficits during the Bush administration. The annual deficit reached record current-dollar levels of US$374 billion in 2003 and US$413 billion in 2004. National debt, the cumulative total of yearly deficits, rose from US$5.7 trillion (58% of GDP) to US$8.3 trillion (67% of GDP) under Bush, as compared to the US$2.7 trillion total debt owed when Ronald Reagan left office, which was 52% of the GDP.

According to the &quot;baseline&quot; forecast of federal revenue and spending by the Congressional Budget Office (in its January 2005 Baseline Budget Projections), the budget deficits will decrease over the next several years. In this projection the deficit will fall to US$368 billion in 2005, US$261 billion in 2007, and US$207 billion in 2009, with a small surplus by 2012. The CBO noted, however, that this projection &quot;omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year — and possibly for some time to come — for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and for other activities related to the global War on Terrorism.&quot; The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts &quot;will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010.&quot; If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then &quot;the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion.&quot; Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy.

Federal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first four and a half years. Non-defense spending increased 18% in that time. Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about US$450 billion are planned to be spent on defense. This level is generally comparable to the defense spending during the cold war. Congress approved US$87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in November, and had approved an earlier US$79 billion package last spring. Most of those funds were for U.S. military operations in the two countries.

Former President Clinton&#x27;s last budget featured an increase of 16% on domestic non security discretionary spending. Growth under President Bush was cut to 6.2% in his first budget, 5.5% in his second, 4.3% in his third, and 2.2% in his fourth.

=== Trade ===
President Bush signed a large number of free trade agreements into law during his presidency: Jordan (2001), Singapore and Chile (2004), Australia (2005), Dominican Republic, CAFTA, Morocco, Oman, and Bahrain (2006), and Oman and Peru (2009).

The Bush administration also launched trade negotiations with New Zealand, Thailand, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, with some being completed during President Obama&#x27;s first term in office (2009–2013).

However, Bush resorted to protectionist policies on occasion. Tariffs on imported steel and on Canadian softwood lumber were controversial in light of his advocacy of free market policies in other areas. The steel tariff was later lifted after the World Trade Organization ruled them illegal. Bush explained that the safeguard measures had &quot;achieved their purpose&quot;, and &quot;as a result of changed economic circumstances&quot;, it was time to lift them. A negotiated settlement to the softwood lumber dispute was reached in April 2006, and the historic seven-year deal was finalized on July 1, 2006.

=== Regulation ===
Some say economic regulation expanded rapidly during the Bush administration. President Bush is described by these observers as the biggest regulator since President Richard Nixon. Bush administration increased the number of new pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100 million a year, increased by 70%.

Spending on regulation increased by 62% from $26.4 billion to $42.7 billion.

The 2008 financial crisis occurred near the end of the Bush second term and has been regarded by some as an enormous failure of financial deregulation.

=== Employment ===

Looking at the annual average unemployment rates for each of the eight years of Bush&#x27;s presidency, the average of all eight figures, and thus of his entire presidency, is 5.26%, with a low of 4.6% for the years of 2006 and 2007, and a high of 6.0% for 2003.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed was nearly 6.0 million in January 2001 and 6.9 million in September 2006. The unemployment rate was 4.2% in January 2001, 4.6% in September 2006, and 7.2% in December 2008. Employment peaked in late 1999 and declined through 2008.
The Current Population Survey (aka Household Survey) measures the percentage of the population that is employed and unemployed. The result can be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that the percentage of the population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration.
Private sector employment, as measured by private nonfarm payrolls, shrank over the 8 years of the George W. Bush presidency. There were modest gains in private-sector payroll employment during his first term, but these were more than offset by the shedding of workers by the private sector in his second term. There were 463,000 fewer private-sector payroll jobs when he left office than when he came into office.

=== Economic Report ===
In 2004, a full chapter on Iraq&#x27;s economy was excised from the Economic Report of the President, in part because it doesn&#x27;t fit the &quot;feel good&quot; tone of the writing, according to White House officials.

== Education ==
=== No Child Left Behind ===
In January 2002, Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy as chief sponsor, which aims to close the achievement gap, measures student performance, provides options to parents with children in low-performing schools, and targets more federal funding to low-income schools. Critics, including Senator John Kerry and the National Education Association, say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based on premise that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce said that the Department of Education&#x27;s overall funding increased by US$14 billion since the enactment of NCLB in fiscal year 2001, going from US$42.6 billion to US$56.6 billion in fiscal year 2005. Some state governments are refusing to implement provisions of the act as long as they are not adequately funded.

In January 2005, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that the United States Department of Education had paid US$240,000 to African-American conservative political commentator Armstrong Williams &quot;to promote the law on his nationally syndicated television show and to urge other black journalist to do the same.&quot; Williams did not disclose the payments.

The House Education and Workforce Committee stated, &quot;As a result of the No Child Left Behind Act, signed by Bush on January 8, 2002, the Federal government today is spending more money on elementary and High School (K-12) education than at any other time in the history of the United States.&quot; Funding increases have to a large degree been offset at the state level by increased costs associated with implementing NCLB, as well as the impacts of the economic downturn on education budgets.

== Diversity and civil rights ==
=== Faith-based initiatives ===
In early-2001, President Bush worked with Republicans in Congress to pass legislation changing the way the federal government regulated, taxed and funded charities and non-profit initiatives run by religious organizations. Although prior to the legislation it was possible for these organizations to receive federal assistance, the new legislation removed reporting requirements, which required the organizations to separate their charitable functions from their religious functions. Bush also created the White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives. Days into his first term, Bush announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations. Bush created the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith-based service organizations. Critics claimed that this was an infringement of the separation of church and state.
=== LGBT issues ===
As Governor of Texas, Bush had opposed efforts to repeal the criminal prohibition on &quot;homosexual conduct&quot;, the same law that the United States Supreme Court overturned in 2003, &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;. During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of gay rights legislation, although he did meet with an approved group of Log Cabin Republicans, a first for a Republican presidential candidate.

In his first four years of office, his views on gay rights were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal President Clinton&#x27;s Executive Order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but its critics felt it was ignored. He did not attempt to repeal Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell, nor try to change it. He threatened to veto the Matthew Shepard Act, which would have included sexual orientation in hate crimes.

While President Bush had always been on record as opposing the legal recognition of same-sex marriages, the 2004 Republican campaign strategy was to focus on &quot;value issues&quot; such as a Federal Marriage Amendment, that would prohibit same-sex couples from obtaining any legal recognition. President Bush endorsed this proposed amendment, but late in the campaign told ABC News and Larry King that he did not have a problem with state legislators enacting some type of civil unions legislation, although critics charged that the constitutional amendment he endorsed did not permit recognition of such unions.

Bush still expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment in his February 2, 2005 State of the Union address
and during the 2006 midterm election, but given that it did not even receive majority support in the Senate, has ignored this issue in his most recent public statements and speeches.

Bush was the first Republican president to appoint an openly gay man to serve in his administration, Scott Evertz, as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy. In addition, during Bush&#x27;s first term, his nominee as ambassador to Romania, Michael E. Guest, became the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate as a U.S. ambassador. The first openly gay ambassador, James Hormel, received a recess appointment from Bill Clinton after the Senate failed to confirm the nomination.

===Minorities, civil rights and affirmative action===
Bush endorsed civil rights and appointed blacks, women and gays to high positions. The premier cabinet position, Secretary of State, went to Colin Powell (2001–2005), the first Black at that high a level. He was followed by Condoleezza Rice (2005–2009), the first Black woman. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales (2005–2007) was and remains in 2024 the highest appointed Hispanic in the history of American government. In addition Bush appointed the first senior officials who were publicly gay. However he campaigned against quotas, and warned that affirmative action that involved quotas were unacceptable. He deliberately selected minorities known as opponents of affirmative action for key civil rights positions. Thus in 2001 Bush nominated Linda Chavez to be the first Latina in the cabinet as Secretary of Labor. She had to withdraw when it was reported that a decade earlier she had hired an illegal immigrant.

According to a CNN exit poll, Bush&#x27;s support from African-Americans increased during his presidency from 9% of the black vote in 2000 to 11% in 2004. An increase in Ohio (from 9% to 16%, each ± about 5%) may have helped give the victory to Bush over Kerry.

Although Bush expressed appreciation for the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling upholding the selection of college applicants for purposes of diversity, his administration filed briefs against it. Bush has said he opposes government sanctioned and enforced quotas and racial preferences, but that the private and public sector should be encouraged to reach out to accomplished minorities to increase employment diversity.

In August 2005, a report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights states that &quot;the government fails to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives as the Constitution requires.&quot; Chairman Gerald A. Reynolds explained, &quot;Federal agencies do not independently evaluate, conduct research, collect data, or periodically review programs to determine whether race-neutral strategies will provide an adequate alternative to race-conscious programs.&quot; Civil rights groups expressed concern that the report was an attack on affirmative action inconsistent with Grutter v. Bollinger.

=== Genetic non-discrimination ===
President George W. Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The bill protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.

=== Voting rights ===
Bush signed into law the Help America Vote Act in 2002, which was drafted in response to the irregularities of the 2000 U.S. presidential election which brought him into office. It created the Election Assistance Commission, increased accessibility and security standards for polling places and voting systems, mandated state governments to create statewide voter rolls with regular quality maintenance, required state governments to allow voters to use provisional ballots when requested, and mandated that first-time voters present identification to election officials. In 2006, Bush signed the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, which reauthorized the VRA for another 25 years. However, both of his appointees to the Supreme Court - Roberts and Alito - voted with the conservative majority in 2013 to invalidate Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act.

== Health ==

=== Health care ===
In July 2002, Bush cut off U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Bush stated that the UNFPA supported forced abortions and sterilizations in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Bush sought to expand Medicare so it would also cover the cost of prescription drugs, a program that became known as Medicare Part D. Many congressional Democrats opposed the bill because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of drugs, while many conservative Republicans opposed the expansion of the government&#x27;s involvement in healthcare. Assisted by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Bush overcame strong opposition and won passage of his Medicare bill. In December 2003, Bush signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, the largest expansion of Medicare since the program&#x27;s creation in 1965.

Bush signed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003, having declared his aim to &quot;promote a culture of life&quot;.

In 2007, Bush vetoed the expansion of the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program stating his concern that the bill would &quot;federalize health care&quot;. His veto was criticized as the bill as insensitive to children&#x27;s needs. The House of Representatives failed to override Bush&#x27;s veto on October 18. On December 12, 2007, Bush vetoed a similar bill regarding children&#x27;s healthcare.

=== Abortion ===
On his first day in office, President Bush implemented the Mexico City Policy; this policy required nongovernmental organizations receiving federal funds to agree not to perform abortions or to actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations. In 2002, President Bush signed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which extends legal protection to infants born alive after failed attempts at induced abortion. Also in 2002, President Bush withdrew funding from the United Nations Population Fund based on a finding that UNPF&#x27;s activities facilitated China&#x27;s one-child-only/forced abortion policy. In 2003, President Bush signed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act into law; that law was later upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;. President Bush signed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act (Laci and Conner&#x27;s Law), which provides that a person who commits certain federal violent crimes and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury to, a fetus shall be guilty of a separate offense, whether or not the person knew the mother was pregnant or intended to harm the fetus.

=== Euthanasia ===
Bush staunchly opposes euthanasia. He supported Ashcroft&#x27;s decision to file suit against the voter-approved Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court in favor of the Oregon law. As governor of Texas, however, Bush had signed a law which gave hospitals the authority to take terminally ill patients off of life support against the wishes of their spouse or parents, if the doctors deemed it medically appropriate. This became an issue in 2005, when the President signed controversial legislation forwarded and voted on by only three members of the Senate to initiate federal intervention in the Terri Schiavo case.
=== Workplace safety ===
On March 20, 2001, Bush signed a repeal of workplace safety regulations that were intended to prevent injuries of employees across America.

== Social Security ==

After winning re-election in 2004, Bush made the partial privatization of Social Security his top domestic priority. He proposed restructuring the program so that citizens could invest some of the money they paid in payroll taxes, which fund the Social Security program. The president argued that Social Security faced an imminent funding crisis and that reform was necessary to ensure its continuing solvency. Bush expected a difficult congressional battle over his proposal, but, as he put it, &quot;I&#x27;ve got political capital, and I intend to spend it.&quot; Groups like the AARP strongly opposed the plan, as did moderate Democrats like Max Baucus, who had supported the Bush tax cuts. Ultimately, Bush failed to win the backing of a single congressional Democrat for his plan, and even moderate Republicans like Olympia Snowe and Lincoln Chafee refused to back privatization. In the face of unified opposition, Republicans abandoned Bush&#x27;s Social Security proposal in mid-2005.

Bush called for major reforms in Social Security, identifying the system&#x27;s projected insolvency as a priority early in his second term. From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending &quot;crisis&quot;. Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax (FICA) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims.

Most Democrats and some Republicans are critical of such ideas, partly because of the large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom&#x27;s privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush&#x27;s bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush&#x27;s plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.

<text>The Campylobacterales are an order of Campylobacterota which make up the epsilon subdivision, together with the small family Nautiliaceae. They are Gram-negative. Most of the species are microaerophilic.

==Molecular signatures==
Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 49 proteins which are uniquely found in virtually all species of the order Campylobacterales. Additionally, two conserved signature indels have been identified which, along with the proteins, serve as molecular markers for the order. The indels are a three-amino-acid insertion in the B protein of the Uvr ABC system, and a two-amino-acid deletion in phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase.

==Phylogeny==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
Unassigned genera:
* &quot;&quot;Flexispira&quot; 
* &quot;Candidatus&quot; Thioturbo&quot; 
* &quot;Thiofractor&quot;

<text>Final Justice (also known as &quot;The Maltese Connection&quot; and &quot;The Maltese Project&quot;) is a 1985 Italian-American action film directed, produced and written by Greydon Clark, and stars Joe Don Baker as a Texas sheriff who causes chaos in Malta in order to find the mobster who killed his partner.

==Plot==

Mafiosi Joseph Palermo (Venantino Venantini) and his brother Tony are fleeing across the border after assassinating a building contractor. They get into a car accident and, after killing the driver of the other car, they decide to hijack a car from a local police station. In the ensuing firefight, Palermo shoots and kills the sheriff (Greydon Clark). The gangsters are pursued across the border by the sheriff&#x27;s deputy, a no-nonsense Apache-descendant named Thomas Jefferson Geronimo III (Baker). He shoots Tony dead and captures Joseph, who swears he will take revenge for his brother&#x27;s death.

As a publicity stunt, a US State Department official named Wilson (Bill McKinney) orders Geronimo to escort Palermo to Italy. However, the plane is sabotaged and forced to land in Malta. Soon after arriving in Valletta, Geronimo is ambushed by gangsters and Palermo escapes his custody.

The Maltese police, under the command of Superintendent Mifsud (Lino Grech), assure Geronimo that they will recapture Palermo themselves. Chief Wilson telephones and orders Geronimo to return to Texas. But Geronimo is determined to capture Palermo himself. With the help of a local policewoman, Maria Cassar (Helena Dalli), he eventually tracks Palermo to the estate of Don Lamanna, a local bigwig. Geronimo is repeatedly arrested by the Maltese authorities, but always manages to escape and continue his pursuit of the gangster.

Eventually, it turns out that Palermo was in cahoots with Wilson, who had never intended for Geronimo to deliver Palermo to Italy. In the end, Cassar kills Wilson and Geronimo kills Palermo.

==Reception==
Reception to &quot;Final Justice&quot; was negative. David Pickering for &quot;Corpus Christi Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s plot and its use of sex and violence.

==Legacy==
===Mystery Science Theater 3000===
In 1999, &quot;Final Justice&quot; was featured and lampooned in the eighth episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;&#x27;s tenth season. It is the second film starring Baker to be riffed, following &quot;Mitchell&quot;, to which a few references were made.

The version used in the episode contains a very prominent editing mistake. Early in the film when the sheriff (director Clark) dies, there is a shot of the partner getting killed and collapsing to the ground. Moments later, the same shot is repeated. This error only appears in a television print, and the original Vestron Video release does not.

===RiffTrax===
In 2017, RiffTrax released a video on demand of &quot;Final Justice&quot; with a new comedic commentary, distinct from the &quot;MST3K&quot; version. It is the fourth of Clark&#x27;s films to receive the RiffTrax treatment, following &quot;Angels Revenge&quot;, &quot;Star Games&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot;.

<text>Walter Rayford Tucker III (born May 28, 1957) is an American lawyer, politician and minister who served as mayor of Compton and a one-term U.S. Representative from California from 1993 to 1995.

==Parents and education==

Tucker was born in Compton, California. He is the son of Walter R. Tucker, Jr. – a dentist who was the mayor of Compton beginning in 1981. The younger Tucker finished Compton High School in 1974 as the class valedictorian and attended Princeton University for the next two years. He graduated from the University of Southern California in 1978 with a degree in political science and earned his J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1981. He was admitted to the California State Bar in 1984.

==Professional life==

===Legal practice and mayor of Compton===
Tucker was a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney from 1984 to 1986, when he began in private practice as a criminal defense attorney. After Tucker&#x27;s father died while still in office as mayor of Compton, the younger Tucker won a special election to replace him, becoming the youngest mayor in the city&#x27;s history at age 33. He served from 1991 to 1992, during the civil unrest in Los Angeles County spawned by the Rodney King verdict.

===Congressional career===
In 1992, Tucker was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat, defeating Lynn Dymally, the daughter of the retiring Representative Mervyn Dymally.

In Congress, Tucker served on the Committee on Public Works and Transportation and the House Small Business Committee, He introduced legislation promoting Random Acts of Kindness, opposed passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), fought to save the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, and worked to ensure the successful development of the Alameda Corridor Project. He also worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to secure federal funding to repair the long neglected Compton Creek, thus eliminating the possibility of costly flood damage to the homes and property on either side of the waterway.

==Criminal conviction and sentencing==

In 1995 Tucker was convicted on seven counts of extortion and two counts of tax evasion. The charges stemmed from his acceptance of $30,000 in bribes during his tenure as Mayor of Compton in 1991, prior to his election to Congress. Tucker maintained his innocence throughout the trial, claiming he had been set up by government prosecutors targeting Black officeholders, although his conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal.

Tucker was sentenced to 27 months in prison by Federal District Court Judge Consuelo Bland Marshall. The sentence also included three years of supervised release following his imprisonment.

Tucker resigned from Congress after his conviction in 1995.

==Ministry==

Tucker began his active ministry while at the Federal Prison Camp in Lompoc, California. After his release he was hired as the Helps Ministry manager for Crenshaw Christian Center in Los Angeles, and he then joined with Charles Colson&#x27;s Prison Fellowship Ministry as Los Angeles area director. He moved with his family to Chicago, where for nine years he was a pastor of the From the Heart Church Ministries of Chicago. He is now the pastor of the Truth and Love Christian Church in Carson, California.

==Personal==

Tucker is married to Robin Smith and they have two children – Walter R. Tucker IV and Autumn Monet Tucker. He has two sisters – Keta and Camillie, and a brother – Kenneth.

<doc id="958401" wikidata="Q5988910" url="?curid=958401" title="Idiopathic short stature">
<text>[[Idiopathic]] short stature (ISS) refers to extreme short stature that does not have a diagnostic explanation (&quot;idiopathic&quot; designates a condition that is unexplained or not understood) after an ordinary growth evaluation. The term has been in use since at least 1975 without a precise percentile or statistical definition of &quot;extreme&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
=== Definition ===
In 2003 Eli Lilly and Company offered a more precise definition of ISS when the pharmaceutical company submitted clinical trial data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting approval to advertise their brand of growth hormone for the treatment of ISS. They proposed a definition of a height more than 2.25 standard deviations below mean, roughly equal to the shortest 1.2% of the population. 

Other researchers have described a cutoff of 2.0 standard deviations.

== Treatment ==

There is some evidence that hormone treatment may not result in a significant improvement in psychosocial functioning.

It is estimated that it would cost US$100,000 or more

to treat someone, but might only move them from the first percentile to perhaps the 10th. There is some ethical and economic concern whether such treatment would merely shift discrimination to the next most effected percentile. The use of insulin-like growth factor 1 or aromatase inhibitors have been proposed as an alternative to growth hormone.

===Advantage===
Short stature decreases risk of venous insufficiency.

<doc id="958406" wikidata="Q781470" url="?curid=958406" title="Intermezzo">
<text>In music, an intermezzo (, , plural form: intermezzi), in the most general sense, is a composition which fits between other musical or dramatic entities, such as acts of a play or movements of a larger musical work. In music history, the term has had several different usages, which fit into two general categories: the opera intermezzo and the instrumental intermezzo.
==Renaissance intermezzo==

The Renaissance intermezzo was also called the intermedio. It was a masque-like dramatic piece with music, which was performed between the acts of a play at Italian court festivities on special occasions, especially weddings. By the late 16th century, the intermezzo had become the most spectacular form of dramatic performance, and an important precursor to opera. The most famous examples were created for Medici weddings in 1539, 1565, and 1589. In Baroque Spain the equivalent entremés or paso was a one-act comic scene, often ending in music and dance, between &quot;jornadas&quot; (acts) of a play.

==Opera intermezzo==
The intermezzo, in the 18th century, was a comic operatic interlude inserted between acts or scenes of an &quot;opera seria&quot;. These intermezzi could be substantial and complete works themselves, though they were shorter than the &quot;opera seria&quot; which enclosed them; typically they provided comic relief and dramatic contrast to the tone of the bigger opera around them, and often they used one or more of the stock characters from the opera or from the commedia dell&#x27;arte. In this they were the reverse of the Renaissance intermezzo, which usually had a mythological or pastoral subject as a contrast to a main comic play. Often they were of a burlesque nature, and characterized by slapstick comedy, disguises, dialect, and ribaldry. The most famous of all intermezzi from the period is Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;La serva padrona&quot;, which was an &quot;opera buffa&quot; that after the death of Pergolesi kicked off the Querelle des Bouffons.

In some cases the intermezzo repertory spread more quickly than did the &quot;opera seria&quot; itself; the singers were often renowned, the comic effects were popular, and intermezzi were relatively easy to produce and stage. In the 1730s the style spread around Europe, and some cities—for example Moscow—recorded visits and performances by troupes performing intermezzi years before any actual &quot;opera seria&quot; were done.

The intermède (the French equivalent of the intermezzo) was the single most important outside operatic influence in Paris in the mid-18th century, and helped create an entire new repertory of opera in France (see &quot;opéra comique&quot;).

The word was used (with a hint of irony) as the title of Richard Strauss&#x27;s two-act opera, &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1924), the scale of which far exceeds the intermezzo of tradition.

Many of the most celebrated intermezzi are from operas of the verismo period: Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;, Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; and &quot;Suor Angelica&quot;, Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Fedora&quot;, Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, and especially that from Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Thais&quot;, which became known as the &quot;Méditation&quot;.

==Instrumental intermezzo==
In the 19th century, the intermezzo acquired another meaning: an instrumental piece which was either a movement between two others in a larger work or a character piece that could stand on its own. These intermezzi show a wide variation in the style and function: in Mendelssohn&#x27;s incidental music to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; the intermezzo serves as musical connecting material for action in Shakespeare&#x27;s play; in chamber music by Mendelssohn and Brahms, the intermezzi are names for interior movements which would otherwise be called scherzi; and the piano intermezzi by Brahms, some of his last compositions, are sets of independent character pieces not intended to connect anything else together. Stylistically, intermezzi of the 19th century are usually lyrical and melodic, especially compared to the movements on either side, when they occur in larger works. The Brahms piano intermezzi in particular have an extremely wide emotional range, and are often considered some of the finest character pieces written in the 19th century. 

Opera composers sometimes wrote instrumental intermezzi as connecting pieces between acts of operas. In this sense, an intermezzo is similar to the entr&#x27;acte. The most famous of this type of intermezzo is probably the intermezzo from Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;. Puccini also wrote intermezzi for &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, and examples exist by Wolf-Ferrari, Delius and others.

Also, incidental music for plays usually contained several intermezzi. Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Rosamunde&quot; music as well as Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; contained several intermezzi for the respective plays.

Schumann combined intermezzi in several of his works featuring piano, including the Piano Concerto Op. 54. &quot;Carnaval&quot; Op. 9 and intermezzi Op. 4

In the 20th century, the term was used occasionally. Shostakovich named one movement of his dark String Quartet No. 15 &quot;intermezzo&quot;; Bartók used the term for the fourth movement (of five) of his &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;.

<doc id="958409" wikidata="Q7191290" url="?curid=958409" title="Pidgin code">
<text>In computer programming, pidgin code is a mixture of several programming languages in the same program, or pseudocode that is a mixture of a programming language with natural language descriptions. Hence the name: the mixture is a programming language analogous to a pidgin in natural languages.

==Examples==
In numerical computation, mathematical style pseudocode is sometimes called pidgin code, for example &quot;pidgin ALGOL&quot; (the origin of the concept), &quot;pidgin Fortran&quot;, &quot;pidgin BASIC&quot;, &quot;pidgin Pascal&quot;, and &quot;pidgin C&quot;. It is a compact and often informal notation that blends syntax taken from a conventional programming language with mathematical notation, typically using set theory and matrix operations, and perhaps also natural language descriptions. 

It can be understood by a wide range of mathematically trained people, and is used as a way to describe algorithms where the control structure is made explicit at a rather high level of detail, while some data structures are still left at an abstract level, independent of any specific programming language. 

Normally non-ASCII typesetting is used for the mathematical equations, for example by means of TeX or MathML markup, or proprietary Formula editor formats. 

These are examples of articles that contain mathematical style pseudocode:
*Algorithm
*Conjugate gradient method
*Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
*Gauss–Seidel method
*Generalized minimal residual method
*Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm
*Jacobi method
*Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm
*Particle swarm optimization
*Stone method
*Successive over-relaxation
*Symbolic Cholesky decomposition
*Tridiagonal matrix algorithm

<doc id="958417" wikidata="Q177238" url="?curid=958417" title="Esteban Torres">
<text>Esteban Edward Torres (January 27, 1930 – January 25, 2022) was an American politician who served as member of the United States House of Representatives for California&#x27;s 34th congressional district from 1983 to 1999.

==Early life and education==
Torres was born in Miami, Arizona, to parents from Mexico. He was raised in East Los Angeles, California mostly by his mother, Rena Gómez. His father was a miner, but was deported to Mexico during the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s. He graduated from East Los Angeles College and California State University, Los Angeles, and later took graduate courses at the University of Maryland, College Park, and American University.

==Career==
He served in the United States Army from 1949 to 1953. Torres came up through the United Auto Workers, ultimately serving as the international representative of UAW 1964-68 in Washington, DC. In addition to being active in the labor movement, he was appointed United States Ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris, France, from 1977 to 1979 and served as a special assistant to President Jimmy Carter from 1979 to 1981.

Torres was unsuccessful in his attempt to win a seat in the House of Representatives in 1974, but was elected in 1982 as a Democrat. He served from 1983 until 1999. During his time in office, he prioritized issue related to Hispanics, and in 1986 he played a key role in the development and passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act.

He did not run for reelection in 1998 and was succeeded by Democrat Grace Napolitano. He served as a member of the California Transportation Commission from 1997 to 2007.

==Personal life and death==
Torres and his wife, Arcy Sanchez, had four children. He died on January 25, 2022, two days shy of his 92nd birthday.

==Legacy and awards==
* Esteban E. Torres NCLR-Harvard Mid-Career Fellowship Program - a partnership between NCLR and the John F. Kennedy School of Government
* Esteban Torres High School
*In 2001, Torres was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.

<doc id="958434" wikidata="Q1569565" url="?curid=958434" title="Hainzel (crater)">
<text>Hainzel is the southern member of a trio of overlapping lunar impact craters. The composite rim is located at the west edge of Lacus Timoris in the southwest sector of the Moon. The heavily worn crater Mee is attached to the southwest wall; its rim forms a ridge running from the south of the Hainzel formation.

Hainzel forms the south portion of the grouping, and is overlain by Hainzel C to the northeast, and then by Hainzel A in the north. Hainzel A is the most intact and also the youngest of the cluster. The wall between Hainzel and Hainzel C is the most intact of the interior rims, forming a promontory from the southeast wall. Both Hainzel A and C have central peaks.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hainzel.

<text>Sir Edward Belcher (27 February 1799 – 18 March 1877) was a British naval officer, hydrographer, and explorer. Born in Nova Scotia, he was the great-grandson of Jonathan Belcher, who served as a colonial governor of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Belcher was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the second son of Andrew Belcher and entered the Royal Navy in 1812.

===Surveys===
In 1825, he accompanied Frederick William Beechey&#x27;s expedition to the Pacific and Bering Strait as a surveyor. In 1835 he was surveying in the Irish Sea in , and in 1836 he commanded a surveying ship on the north and west coasts of Africa and in the British seas. Belcher took up the work which Beechey had left unfinished on the Pacific coast of South America. He was on board , which was ordered to return to England in 1839 via the Trans-Pacific route. Belcher made various observations at a number of islands which he visited, having been delayed by being despatched to take part in the war in China in 1840.

On 25 January 1841, Commander Belcher landed on Possession Point at the north shore Hong Kong Island, and made the first British survey of Hong Kong harbour. After the war&#x27;s end in 1842 he reached home and for his services was made a Knight Bachelor in the following year. He was then engaged on , in surveying work in the East Indies, the Philippines, Port Hamilton, and other places, until 1847.

===Arctic expedition===
In 1852 Belcher led the last and largest Admiralty expedition to attempt to find and rescue Sir John Franklin. He was also to look for his former surveying officer in Hong Kong, Sir Richard Collinson, and Sir Robert McClure, whose ships had not been seen after entering the Bering Strait. He did a great deal of sledge exploration, rescued McClure and abandoned four of his five ships in the ice.

He had five ships: (Belcher), (Henry Kellett, second mate George Nares), the steam tenders &quot;Pioneer&quot; (Sherard Osborn) and &quot;Intrepid&quot; (Sir Leopold McClintock) and the depot ship (William Pullen). Belcher and one tender were to enter the Wellington Channel, between Cornwallis Island and Devon Island, where Franklin was thought to be, while Kellett was to go west to Melville Island and look for Collinson and McClure. &quot;North Star&quot; was to stay at Beechey Island as a supply base.

He left the Nore in April 1852. By early winter &quot;Assistance&quot; and &quot;Pioneer&quot; were frozen in at Northumberland Sound to the north of Wellington Channel while &quot;Resolute&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot; were frozen in off Melville Island – the first ships this far West since Sir William Edward Parry in 1819. A great deal of exploration was done by manhauled sledges. In April 1853 Leopold McClintock and others left &quot;Resolute&quot; on sledges and returned 105 days later, having covered and discovered Prince Patrick Island.

Another party went West and discovered Robert McClure, whose ship was frozen in at Mercy Bay. Belcher went north by sledge and found a channel at the northern tip of Devon Island, hinting that Franklin might have used it to escape to Baffin Bay. When the ice broke up that summer, he pushed his ships up Wellington Channel and became trapped again.

By February 1854, Belcher was becoming increasingly worried about the safety of his ships and men. In April he ordered Kellett to abandon his ships and return by sledge to &quot;North Star&quot;. Belcher abandoned his two ships in late July. Aided by two ships that showed up at Beechey Island ( and ), the whole party returned to England. Belcher went through a court martial, which was automatic for any captain who had lost a ship.


He was exonerated, but his sword was returned to him &quot;without observation&quot;. He never again received an active command. Curiously &quot;Resolute&quot; broke free of the ice and drifted all the way to Davis Strait, southwest of Greenland, where it was picked up by an American whaler. The American government graciously returned the ship to the United Kingdom, and when many years later the ship was broken up, its timbers were used to make a desk for the American president by way of a thank you. This &quot;Resolute&quot; desk, a gift from Queen Victoria, is still used today in the Oval Office.

Despite his achievements, Belcher would later be described by a Hydrographer of the Navy as “a tyrannical martinet who made every ship he commanded a floating hell.”

===Later life===
Following his last active service, Belcher was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1867, and an admiral in 1872.

==Personal life==
He was briefly married to Diana Jolliffe, stepdaughter of Captain Peter Heywood; that marriage ending upon her application for legal separation for his having infected her with venereal disease.

== Legacy ==
Belcher is commemorated in Hong Kong through Belcher&#x27;s Street, Belcher Bay and The Belcher&#x27;s in Kennedy Town. His name is also commemorated in the Belcher Islands, in the Canadian Arctic. He is also commemorated with a plaque in the Admiralty Garden, CFB Halifax.

A highly venomous seasnake, &quot;Hydrophis belcheri&quot;, is also named in his honour. Belcher collected the holotype which is housed in the Natural History Museum, London.

<doc id="958449" wikidata="Q17028380" url="?curid=958449" title="Hyperbolic orthogonality">
<text>In geometry, the relation of hyperbolic orthogonality between two lines separated by the asymptotes of a hyperbola is a concept used in special relativity to define simultaneous events. Two events will be simultaneous when they are on a line hyperbolically orthogonal to a particular timeline. This dependence on a certain timeline is determined by velocity, and is the basis for the relativity of simultaneity. Furthermore, keeping time and space axes hyperbolically orthogonal, as in Minkowski space, gives a constant result when measurements are taken of the speed of light.

==Geometry==
Two lines are hyperbolic orthogonal when they are reflections of each other over the asymptote of a given hyperbola.
Two particular hyperbolas are frequently used in the plane:
The relation of hyperbolic orthogonality actually applies to classes of parallel lines in the plane, where any particular line can represent the class. Thus, for a given hyperbola and asymptote &quot;A&quot;, a pair of lines (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) are hyperbolic orthogonal if there is a pair (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) such that formula_1, and &quot;c&quot; is the reflection of &quot;d&quot; across &quot;A&quot;.

Similar to the perpendularity of a circle radius to the tangent, a radius to a hyperbola is hyperbolic orthogonal to a tangent to the hyperbola.

A bilinear form is used to describe orthogonality in analytic geometry, with two elements orthogonal when their bilinear form vanishes. In the plane of complex numbers formula_2, the bilinear form is formula_3, while in the plane of hyperbolic numbers formula_4 the bilinear form is formula_5
:The vectors &quot;z&quot;1 and &quot;z&quot;2 in the complex number plane, and &quot;w&quot;1 and &quot;w&quot;2 in the hyperbolic number plane are said to be respectively &quot;Euclidean orthogonal&quot; or &quot;hyperbolic orthogonal&quot; if their respective inner products [bilinear forms] are zero.

The bilinear form may be computed as the real part of the complex product of one number with the conjugate of the other. Then
:formula_6 entails perpendicularity in the complex plane, while
:formula_7 implies the &quot;w&quot;&#x27;s are hyperbolic orthogonal.

The notion of hyperbolic orthogonality arose in analytic geometry in consideration of conjugate diameters of ellipses and hyperbolas. If &quot;g&quot; and &quot;g&quot;′ represent the slopes of the conjugate diameters, then formula_8 in the case of an ellipse and formula_9 in the case of a hyperbola. When &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; the ellipse is a circle and the conjugate diameters are perpendicular while the hyperbola is rectangular and the conjugate diameters are hyperbolic-orthogonal.

In the terminology of projective geometry, the operation of taking the hyperbolic orthogonal line is an involution. Suppose the slope of a vertical line is denoted ∞ so that all lines have a slope in the projectively extended real line. Then whichever hyperbola (A) or (B) is used, the operation is an example of a hyperbolic involution where the asymptote is invariant. Hyperbolically orthogonal lines lie in different sectors of the plane, determined by the asymptotes of the hyperbola, thus the relation of hyperbolic orthogonality is a heterogeneous relation on sets of lines in the plane.

==Constant light speed==
One of the premises of relativity is that the speed of light does not depend on the inertial frame of reference in which the measurements are done. This premise has been associated with null results in the Michaelson–Morley experiment. As long as space and time axes are hyperbolically orthogonal, the measurement of the speed of light will give the same result. The seeming paradox of light speed invariance with respect to moving observers is resolved in special relativity by this feature of Minkowski space.

==Simultaneity==
Since Hermann Minkowski&#x27;s foundation for spacetime study in 1908, the concept of points in a spacetime plane being hyperbolic-orthogonal to a timeline (tangent to a world line) has been used to define simultaneity of events relative to the timeline, or relativity of simultaneity. In Minkowski&#x27;s development the hyperbola of type (B) above is in use. Two vectors (, , , ) and (, , , ) are &quot;normal&quot; (meaning hyperbolic orthogonal) when
:formula_10
When = 1 and the s and s are zero, ≠ 0, ≠ 0, then formula_11.

Given a hyperbola with asymptote &quot;A&quot;, its reflection in &quot;A&quot; produces the conjugate hyperbola. Any diameter of the original hyperbola is reflected to a conjugate diameter. The directions indicated by conjugate diameters are taken for space and time axes in relativity.
As E. T. Whittaker wrote in 1910, &quot;[the] hyperbola is unaltered when any pair of conjugate diameters are taken as new axes, and a new unit of length is taken proportional to the length of either of these diameters.&quot; On this principle of relativity, he then wrote the Lorentz transformation in the modern form using rapidity.

Edwin Bidwell Wilson and Gilbert N. Lewis developed the concept within synthetic geometry in 1912. They note &quot;in our plane no pair of perpendicular [hyperbolic-orthogonal] lines is better suited to serve as coordinate axes than any other pair&quot;

<doc id="958457" wikidata="Q651377" url="?curid=958457" title="Shunga Empire">
<text>The Shunga Empire (IAST: &quot;&quot;) was a ruling entity centred around Magadha and controlled most of the northern Indian subcontinent from around 187 to 75 BCE. The dynasty was established by Pushyamitra, after taking the throne of Magadha from the Mauryas. The Shunga empire&#x27;s capital was Pataliputra, but later emperors such as Bhagabhadra also held court at Besnagar (modern Vidisha) in eastern Malwa. This dynasty is also responsible for successfully fighting and resisting the Greeks in Shunga–Greek War.

Pushyamitra ruled for 36 years and was succeeded by his son Agnimitra. There were ten Shunga rulers. However, after the death of Agnimitra, the second king of the dynasty, the empire rapidly disintegrated: inscriptions and coins indicate that much of northern and central India consisted of small kingdoms and city-states that were independent of any Shunga hegemony. The dynasty is noted for its numerous wars with both foreign and indigenous powers. They fought the Kalinga, the Satavahana dynasty, the Indo-Greek kingdom and possibly the Panchalas and Mitras of Mathura. 

Art, education, philosophy, and other forms of learning flowered during this period, including small terracotta images, larger stone sculptures, and architectural monuments such as the stupa at Bharhut, and the renowned Great Stupa at Sanchi. The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of Brahmi script and was used to write Sanskrit. 

The Shungas were important patrons of culture at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place. Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot; was composed in this period. Artistry also progressed with the rise of the Mathura art style.

The last of the Shunga emperors was Devabhuti (83–73 BCE). He was assassinated by his minister Vasudeva Kanva and was said to have been overfond of the company of women. The Kanva dynasty succeeded the Shungas around 73 BCE.

==Name==
The name &quot;Shunga&quot; has only been used for convenience to designate the historical polity now generally described as &quot;Shunga empire&quot;, or the historical period known as the &quot;Shunga period&quot;, which follows the fall of the Maurya empire. The term appears in a single epigraphic inscription in Bharhut, in which a dedication to the Buddhist Bharhut stupa is said to have been made &quot;at the time of the Suga kings&quot; (&quot;Suganam raje&quot;), with no indication as to whom these &quot;Suga kings&quot; might be. Other broadly contemporary inscriptions, such as the Heliodorus pillar inscription, are only assumed to relate to Shunga rulers. The Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana mentions a ruler named Pushyamitra, but does not mention the name &quot;Shunga&quot;.

The Bharut epigraph appears on a pillar of the gateway of the stupa, and mentions its erection &quot;during the rule of the &quot;Sugas&quot;, by Vatsiputra Dhanabhuti&quot;. The expression used (&quot;Suganam raje&quot;, Brahmi script: 𑀲𑀼𑀕𑀦𑀁 𑀭𑀚𑁂), may mean &quot;during the rule of the Sugas [Shungas]&quot;, although not without ambiguity as it could also be &quot;during the rule of the Sughanas&quot;, a northern Buddhist kingdom. There is no other instance of the name &quot;Shunga&quot; in the epigraphical record of India. The unique inscription reads:


Dhanabhuti was making a major dedication to a Buddhist monument, Bharhut, whereas the historical &quot;Shungas&quot; are known to have been Hindu monarchs, which would suggest that Dhanabhuti himself may not have been a member of the Shunga dynasty. Neither is he known from &quot;Shunga&quot; regnal lists. The mention &quot;in the reign of the Shungas&quot; also suggests that he was not himself a Shunga ruler, only that he may have been a tributary of the Shungas, or a ruler in a neighbouring territory, such as Kosala or Panchala. 

The name &quot;Sunga&quot; or &quot;Shunga&quot; is also used in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, the date of which is contested, to designate the dynasty of kings starting with Pushyamitra , and ending with Devabhuti circa 75 BCE. According to the Vishnu Purana:

==Origins==

Shungas were originally from Vidisha. 
According to historical reconstructions, the Shunga dynasty was established in 184 BCE, about 50 years after Ashoka&#x27;s death, when the emperor Brihadratha Maurya, the last ruler of the Maurya empire, was assassinated by his &quot;Senānī&quot; or commander-in-chief, Pushyamitra, while he was reviewing the Guard of Honour of his forces. Pushyamitra then ascended the throne.

Pushyamitra became the ruler of Magadha and neighbouring territories. His realm essentially covered the central parts of the old Mauryan empire. The Shunga definitely had control of the central city of Ayodhya in northern central India, as is proved by the Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription. However, the city of Mathura further west never seems to have been under the direct control of the Shungas, as no archaeological evidence of a Shunga presence has ever been found in Mathura. On the contrary, according to the Yavanarajya inscription, Mathura was probably under the control of Indo-Greeks from some time between 180 BCE and 100 BCE, and remained so as late as 70 BCE.

Some ancient sources however claim a greater extent for the Shunga empire: the &quot;Asokavadana&quot; account of the &quot;Divyavadana&quot; claims that the Shungas sent an army to persecute Buddhist monks as far as Sakala (Sialkot) in the Punjab region in the northwest:

Also, the &quot;Malavikagnimitra&quot; claims that the empire of Pushyamitra extended to the Narmada River in the south. They may also have controlled the city of Ujjain. Meanwhile, Kabul and much of the Punjab passed into the hands of the Indo-Greeks and the Deccan Plateau to the Satavahana dynasty.

Pushyamitra died after ruling for 36 years (187–151 BCE). He was succeeded by son Agnimitra. This prince is the hero of a famous drama by one of India&#x27;s greatest playwrights, Kālidāsa. Agnimitra was viceroy of Vidisha when the story takes place.

The power of the Shungas gradually weakened. It is said that there were ten Shunga emperors. The Shungas were succeeded by the Kanva dynasty around 73 BCE.

==Decline of Buddhism==

===Accounts of persecution===

Following the Mauryans, the first Sunga emperor, a Brahmin named Pushyamitra, is believed by some historians to have persecuted Buddhists and contributed to a resurgence of Brahmanism that forced Buddhism outwards to Kashmir, Gandhara and Bactria. Buddhist scripture such as the &quot;Asokavadana&quot; account of the &quot;Divyavadana&quot; and ancient Tibetan historian Taranatha have written about persecution of Buddhists. Pushyamitra is said to have burned down Buddhist monasteries, destroyed stupas, massacred Buddhist monks and put rewards on their heads, but some consider these stories as probable exaggerations.


Pushyamitra is known to have revived the supremacy of the Bramahnical religion and reestablished animal sacrifices (Yajnas) that had been prohibited by Ashoka.

===Accounts against persecution===
Later Shunga emperors were seen as amenable to Buddhism and as having contributed to the building of the stupa at Bharhut. During his reign the Buddhist monuments of Bharhut and Sanchi were renovated and further improved. There is enough evidence to show that Pushyamitra patronised buddhist art. However, given the rather decentralised and fragmentary nature of the Shunga state, with many cities actually issuing their own coinage, as well as the relative dislike of the Shungas for the Buddhist religion, some authors argue that the constructions of that period in Sanchi for example cannot really be called &quot;Shunga&quot;. They were not the result of royal sponsorship, in contrast with what happened during the Mauryas, and most of the dedications at Sanchi were private or collective, rather than the result of royal patronage.  

Some writers believe that Brahmanism competed in political and spiritual realm with Buddhism in the Gangetic plains. Buddhism flourished in the realms of the Bactrian kings. 

Some Indian scholars are of the opinion that the orthodox Shunga emperors were not intolerant towards Buddhism and that Buddhism prospered during the time of the Shunga emperors. The existence of Buddhism in Bengal in the Shunga period can also be inferred from a terracotta tablet that was found at Tamralipti and is on exhibit at the Asutosh Museum in Kolkata.

====Royal dedications====
Two dedications by a king named Brahmamitra as well as the monarch Indragnimitra are recorded at the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya. Some may claim these show Sunga support for Buddhism. These kings, however, are essentially unknown, and do not form a part of the Shunga recorded genealogy. They are thought to be post-Ashokan and to belong to the period of Sunga rule. A Brahmamitra is known otherwise as a local ruler of Mathura, but Indragnimitra is unknown, and according to some authors, Indragnimitra is in fact not even mentioned as a king in the actual inscription.
* An inscription at Bodh Gaya at the Mahabodhi Temple records the construction of the temple as follows:
:&quot;&quot;The gift of Nagadevi the wife of King Brahmamitra.&quot;
* Another inscription reads:
:&quot;The gift of Kurangi, the mother of living sons and the wife of King Indragnimitra, son of Kosiki. The gift also of Srima of the royal palace shrine&quot;.&quot; 

Cunningham has regretted the loss of the latter part of these important records. As regards the first coping inscription, he has found traces of eleven Brahmi letters after &quot;&quot;Kuramgiye danam&quot;, the first nine of which read &quot;rajapasada-cetika sa&quot;. Bloch reads these nine letters as &quot;raja-pasada-cetikasa&quot;&quot; and translates this expression in relation to the preceding words:
&quot;(the gift of Kurangi, the wife of Indragnimitra and the mother of living sons), &quot;to the caitya (cetika) of the noble temple&quot;, taking the word raja before pasada as an epithet on ornans, distinguishing the temple as a particularly large and stately building similar to such expressions as rajahastin &#x27;a noble elephant&#x27;, rajahamsa &#x27;a goose&#x27; (as distinguished from hamsa &#x27;a duck&#x27;), etc.&quot;
Cunningham has translated the expression &quot;the royal palace, the caitya&quot;, suggesting that &quot;the mention of the raja-pasada would seem to connect the donor with the king&#x27;s family.&quot; Luders doubtfully suggests &quot;to the king&#x27;s temple&quot; as a rendering of &quot;raja-pasada-cetikasa.&quot;

===Shunga period contributions in Sanchi===
On the basis of Ashokavadana, it is presumed that the stupa may have been vandalised at one point sometime in the 2nd century BCE, an event some have related to the rise of the Shunga emperor Pushyamitra who overtook the Mauryan empire as an army general. It has been suggested that Pushyamitra may have destroyed the original stupa, and his son Agnimitra rebuilt it. The original brick stupa was covered with stone during the Shunga period.

According to historian Julia Shaw, the post-Mauryan constructions at Sanchi cannot be described as &quot;Sunga&quot; as sponsorship for the construction of the stupas, as attested by the numerous donative inscriptions, was not royal but collective, and the Sungas were known for their opposition to Buddhism.

====Great Stupa (No 1)====
During the later rule of the Shunga, the stupa was expanded with stone slabs to almost twice its original size. The dome was flattened near the top and crowned by three superimposed parasols within a square railing. With its many tiers it was a symbol of the dharma, the Wheel of the Law. The dome was set on a high circular drum meant for circumambulation, which could be accessed via a double staircase. A second stone pathway at ground level was enclosed by a stone balustrade. The railing around Stupa 1 do not have artistic reliefs. These are only slabs, with some dedicatory inscriptions. These elements are dated to .

====Stupa No2 and Stupa No3====
The buildings which seem to have been commissioned during the rule of the Shungas are the Second and Third stupas (but not the highly decorated gateways, which are from the following Satavahana period, as known from inscriptions), and the ground balustrade and stone casing of the Great Stupa (Stupa No 1). The Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana are said to have been placed in Stupa No 3. These are dated to for the medallions, 80 BCE for the gateway carvings, slightly after the reliefs of Bharhut, with some reworks down to the 1st century CE.

The style of the Shunga period decorations at Sanchi bear a close similarity to those of Bharhut, as well as the peripheral balustrades at Bodh Gaya, which are thought to be the oldest of the three.

==Warfare==
War and conflict characterised the Shunga period. They are known to have warred with the Kalingas, Satavahanas, the Indo-Greeks, and possibly the Panchalas and Mathuras.

The Shunga empire&#x27;s wars with the Indo-Greek kingdom figure greatly in the history of this period. From around 180 BCE the Greco-Bactrian ruler Demetrius conquered the Kabul Valley and is theorised to have advanced into the trans-Indus to confront the Shungas. The Indo-Greek Menander I is credited with either joining or leading a campaign to Pataliputra with other Indian rulers; however, very little is known about the exact nature and success of the campaign. The net result of these wars remains uncertain.

===Literary evidence===
Several works, such as the Mahabharata and the Yuga Purana describe the conflict between the Shungas and the Indo-Greeks.

===Military expeditions of the Shungas===
Scriptures such as the &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; claim that Pushyamitra toppled Emperor Brihadratha and killed many Buddhist monks. Then it describes how Pushyamitra sent an army to Pataliputra and as far as Sakala (Sialkot), in the Punjab, to persecute Buddhist monks.

===War with the Yavanas (Greeks)===
The Indo-Greeks, called Yavanas in Indian sources, either led by Demetrius I or Menander I, then invaded India, possibly receiving the help of Buddhists. Menander in particular is described as a convert to Buddhism in the &quot;Milindapanha&quot;.

The Hindu text of the &quot;Yuga Purana&quot;, which describes Indian historical events in the form of a prophecy, relates the attack of the Indo-Greeks on the Shunga capital Pataliputra, a magnificent fortified city with 570 towers and 64 gates according to Megasthenes, and describes the impending war for city:

However, the Yuga Purana indicates that the Yavanas (Indo-Greeks) did not remain for long in Pataliputra, as they were faced with a civil war in Bactria.

Western sources also suggest that this new offensive of the Greeks into India led them as far as the capital Pataliputra:
===Battle on the Sindhu river===
An account of a direct battle between the Greeks and the Shunga is also found in the &quot;Mālavikāgnimitram&quot;, a play by Kālidāsa which describes a battle between a squadron of Greek cavalrymen and Vasumitra, the grandson of Pushyamitra, accompanied by a hundred soldiers on the &quot;Sindhu river&quot;, in which the Indians defeated a squadron of Greeks and Pushyamitra successfully completed the Ashvamedha Yagna. This river may be the Indus River in the northwest, but such expansion by the Shungas is unlikely, and it is more probable that the river mentioned in the text is the Sindh River or the Kali Sindh River in the Ganges Basin.

===Epigraphic and archaeological evidence===

====Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription====
Ultimately, Shunga rule seems to have extended to the area of Ayodhya. Shunga inscriptions are known as far as Ayodhya in northern central India; in particular, the Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription refers to a local king Dhanadeva, who claimed to be the sixth descendant of Pushyamitra. The inscription also records that Pushyamitra performed two Ashvamedhas (victory sacrifices) in Ayodhya.

====Yavanarajya inscription====

The Greeks seem to have maintained control of Mathura. The Yavanarajya inscription, also called the &quot;Maghera inscription&quot;, discovered in Mathura, suggests that the Indo-Greeks were in control of Mathura during the 1st century BCE. The inscription is important in that it mentions the date of its dedication as &quot;The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony (&quot;Yavanarajya&quot;)&quot;. It is considered that this inscription is attesting the control of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE in Mathura, a fact that is also confirmed by numismatic and literary evidence. Moreover, it does not seem that the Shungas ever ruled in Mathura or Surasena since no Shunga coins or inscriptions have been found there.

The &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; of the Mahabharata affirms that the city of Mathura was under the joint control of the Yavanas and the Kambojas.

Later however, it seems the city of Mathura was retaken from them, if not by the Shungas themselves, then probably by other indigenous rulers such as the Datta dynasty or the Mitra dynasty, or more probably by the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps under Rajuvula. In the region of Mathura, the Arjunayanas and Yaudheyas mention military victories on their coins (&quot;Victory of the Arjunayanas&quot;, &quot;Victory of the Yaudheyas&quot;), and during the 1st century BCE, the Trigartas, Audumbaras and finally the Kunindas also started to mint their own coins, thus affirming independence from the Indo-Greeks, although the style of their coins was often derived from that of the Indo-Greeks.

====Heliodorus pillar====

Very little can be said with great certainty. However, what does appear clear is that the two realms appeared to have established normalised diplomatic relations in the succeeding reigns of their respective rulers. The Indo-Greeks and the Shungas seem to have reconciled and exchanged diplomatic missions around 110 BCE, as indicated by the Heliodorus pillar, which records the dispatch of a Greek ambassador named Heliodorus, from the court of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas, to the court of the Shunga emperor Bhagabhadra at the site of Vidisha in central India.

==Decline==
After the death of Agnimitra, the second king of the dynasty, the empire rapidly disintegrated: inscriptions and coins indicate that much of northern and central India consisted of small kingdoms and city-states that were independent of any Shunga hegemony. 

The last king of Sungas, Devabhuti was assassinated by his minister Vasudeva Kanva, who then established Kanva dynasty. According to the Puranas: &quot;The Andhra Simuka will assail the Kanvayanas and Susarman, and destroy the remains of the Sungas&#x27; power and will obtain this earth.&quot; The Andhras did indeed destroy the last remains of the Sunga state in central India somewhere around Vidisha, probably as a feeble rump state.

==Art==
The Shunga art style differed somewhat from imperial Mauryan art, which was influenced by Persian art. In both, continuing elements of folk art and cults of the Mother goddess appear in popular art, but are now produced with more skill in more monumental forms. The Shunga style was thus seen as &#x27;more Indian&#x27; and is often described as the more indigenous.

Art, education, philosophy, and other learning flowered during this period. Most notably, Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras and Mahabhashya were composed in this period. It is also noted for its subsequent mention in the Malavikaagnimitra. This work was composed by Kalidasa in the later Gupta period, and romanticised the love of Malavika and King Agnimitra, with a background of court intrigue.

Artistry on the subcontinent also progressed with the rise of the Mathura school, which is considered the indigenous counterpart to the more Hellenistic Gandhara school (Greco-Buddhist art) of Afghanistan and North-Western frontier of India (modern day Pakistan).

During the historical Shunga period (185 to 73 BCE), Buddhist activity also managed to survive somewhat in central India (Madhya Pradesh) as suggested by some architectural expansions that were done at the stupas of Sanchi and Bharhut, originally started under Emperor Ashoka. It remains uncertain whether these works were due to the weakness of the control of the Shungas in these areas, or a sign of tolerance on their part.

==Script==
The script used by the Shunga was a variant of Brahmi, and was used to write the Sanskrit language. The script is thought to be an intermediary between the Maurya and the Kalinga Brahmi scripts.

<doc id="958469" wikidata="Q5877718" url="?curid=958469" title="Hoi (video game)">
<text>Hoi is a 1992 platform video game developed by Team Hoi and published by Hollyware Entertainment in North America and Software Business in Europe for the Amiga. In the game, players assume the role of the titular lime green &quot;Saur&quot; character venturing into the &quot;Madlands&quot;, an area within Hoi&#x27;s home planet populated with obstacles, to face a ritual test of maturity and find a female partner.

&quot;Hoi&quot; received mostly favourable reception from the Amiga gaming press. Critics praised the audiovisual presentation, gameplay, character animations and puzzle-like elements but some felt mixed in regards to the controls while others criticized its idea, level design, forced memorization approach and collision detection.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Hoi&quot; is a platform game in a similar style as &quot;Super Mario Bros. and Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. The plot revolves around the titular &quot;Saur&quot; character living on a planet in a far away solar system. As soon as the male inhabitants of his planet have reached maturity, each of them cannot escape to face the ultimate ritual test. They have to defy the &quot;Madlands&quot;, a large area of Hoi&#x27;s planet littered with all kinds of dangers. If they survive the quest and manage to reach the other side, they will enter the female part of the planet, with predominantly pleasant consequences. The ritual maturity test was established by Hoi&#x27;s forefathers and serves as a trial to separate the real men from the boys. Hoi sets his teeth and stoutheartedly enters the ultimate challenge.

The player takes control of Hoi through five stages of varying thematic. Some of the stages featured are linear in nature, populated with obstacles and enemies, requiring the player to traverse the stage by running, jumping and climbing while avoiding harmful enemies and obstacles, while other levels that are featured later in the game become more maze-like and exploratory, making the player take different routes and teleports to reach the end. The third and fourth stages requires Hoi to equip himself with a jet-pack and scuba diving. Along the way, the player collects diamonds and gold for bonus points and extra lives. The title uses a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will respawn at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemies, colliding against stage obstacles, falling off the stage, running out of air or being blown up by a bomb will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over.

== Development and release ==

&quot;Hoi&quot; was developed by Team Hoi (previously Soft Eyes), a group of three young Dutch game developers: programmer Reinier van Vliet, artist Metin Seven and composer Ramon Braumuller, who worked on the shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Venom Wing&quot; for the Amiga and recounted its creation process and history through various publications. The project was conceived in 1990 during a gathering at Seven&#x27;s house, who was playing with Deluxe Paint and drew a green character that would become the protagonist of their next release titled &quot;Hoi Let&#x27;s Play!&quot;, as the team were determined to create their &quot;pièce de resistance&quot; and settled with a cute platform game after &quot;Venom Wing&quot; programmer Pieter Opdam left the team to work at Team17.

Work on the project bearing the name of the character began in autumn of 1990, with Seven sketching game ideas on paper notepad pages using ballpen, some of which were never implemented in the final release such as a split-screen two-player mode. Seven stated that the team created and implemented new ideas on-the-fly without the use of storyboards or other elements that would have constrained the team with marking the game during development. He stated that the development period of the title &quot;marked one of the best times of our lives&quot;, as the team had fun creating several game situations and reinforced their friendship but he also claimed that the group did not realize how difficult the final product turned out.

&quot;Hoi&quot; was initially let down by publisher Innerprise Software but was eventually released by Hollyware Entertainment (formerly MicroIllusions) in North America and Software Business in Europe in August 1992. However, Team Hoi did not receive much money from their contract with Hollyware and decided to release a special freeware remix version for the AGA Amiga system range in 1993.

== Reception ==
&quot;Hoi&quot; received mostly favourable reception from the Amiga gaming press. &quot;Aktueller Software Markt&quot;″s Klaus Trafford commended the audiovisual presentation and gameplay but criticized the level design. &quot;Joystick&quot;″s Derek de la Fuente praised the graphics, sound, character animations and controls. &quot;Amiga Action&quot;″s Alan Bunker said the game was adequate for beginners, but that more advanced players should look elsewhere, stating that it plays like an edutainment title intended for a younger audience. &quot;Amiga Format&quot; felt it was playable and fun during a preview article, however Marcus Dyson criticized its forced memorization approach and unintelligent level design, stating that it failed with being an &quot;addictively playable&quot; title, but gave positive remarks to the character and graphics.

&quot;Amiga Joker&quot;″s Richard Löwenstein commended the colorful graphics, music and puzzle-like elements but criticized its controls and overall idea, stating that &quot;&quot;Hoi&quot; simply has too little good and new to offer, even if you include the &quot;stroboscopic effect&quot; that the (English) instructions for the final level promise.&quot; &quot;Amiga Mania&quot;″s Huw Pryce thought a lot of effort was put into every aspect of the game. &quot;Amiga Power&quot;″s Gary Penn called it &quot;amazingly frustrating junk&quot;, criticizing its frustrating design and poor collision detection but ultimately liked playing the game. &quot;Amiga World&quot;″s Peter Olafson regarded it as a very good &quot;&quot;Super Mario Bros./Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;-type&quot; title, praising the smooth scrolling, animated intro and colorful visuals but noted that more could be done to the main character&#x27;s sprite. &quot;The One for Amiga Games&quot;″ Jim Douglas concluded &quot;Graphically, it&#x27;s pretty standard fare. Regulation parallax backdrops scroll behind stone and wood foregrounds that we&#x27;ve seen many times before. But even here there are plenty of innovative touches, such as the stage where platforms are hidden in the parallax background and only available when Hoi moves, making an otherwise predictable ascent up a narrow shaft positively gripping.&quot; Douglas also added positive comments to the sound, arcade-like playability and longevity.

<doc id="958470" wikidata="Q3098092" url="?curid=958470" title="History of corsets">
<text>The corset is a supportive undergarment. It was standard in women&#x27;s fashion in Europe for several centuries and served to shape the body and support upright posture, evolving in form as fashion trends changed. Depending on the era and location, the corset has been called various terms such as a pair of bodies, stays, or corsets.

A pair of bodies or stays, as they were known at the time, first became popular in sixteenth-century Europe, and created in the wearer a conical shape with a flattened bust. The wasp-waisted garment that is now associated with the term &quot;corset&quot; reached the zenith of its popularity in the Victorian era. While the corset has typically been worn as an undergarment, it has occasionally been used as an outer-garment, as can be seen in the national dress of some European countries.

==Etymology==
The English word corset is derived from the diminutive of the Old French word &quot;corps&quot;, meaning &quot;body,&quot; which itself derives from the Latin &quot;corpus&quot;. The term &quot;corset” was in use in the late 14th century, from the French &quot;corset&quot; which meant &quot;a kind of laced bodice.&quot; The meaning of it as a &quot;stiff supporting so constricting undergarment for the waist, worn chiefly by women to shape the figure,&quot; dates from 1795. The term &quot;stays&quot; was frequently used in English circa 1600 until the early twentieth century, and was used interchangeably with corset in the Renaissance. The term &quot;jumps,&quot; deriving from the French word &quot;jupe&quot; &quot;short jacket,&quot; referred to stays without boning, which were less structured and typically laced in the front. 

==Before the 16th century==
The earliest known representation of a possible corset appears on a figurine from Minoan art made circa 1600 BCE. The article of clothing depicted resembles a corset, but is worn as an outer garment, and leaves the breasts exposed.

Corsets have been used for centuries among the Circassians and Abkhaz tribes of the Caucasus region. They were used to &quot;beautify&quot; women and also to ensure modesty. Corsets were laced tightly with as many as fifty laces, and had to be worn from childhood until the wedding night. When the marriage was consummated, a groom had to slowly and carefully undo each lace to demonstrate self-control.

==16th and 17th centuries==
For most of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries corsets were known, in English, as bodies or stays. These garments could be worn as under or outer wear. The women of the French court saw this corset as &quot;indispensable to the beauty of the female figure.&quot;

In the Elizabethan era, pairs of bodies were typically made out of layered fabrics like linen and silk, starched, and stiffened with whalebone. A busk, typically made of wood, ivory, metal, or whalebone, was added to stiffen the front of the bodice. It was carved into a thin knife shape and inserted into the bodice, then fastened and held into place by laces, so that the busk could be easily removed and replaced. By the end of the sixteenth century, bodies were commonly worn garments among the elites of Europe. The front of the corset was typically covered by a &quot;stomacher,&quot; a stiff, V-shaped structure that was worn on the abdomen for decorative purposes. While a few surviving bodies exist that are structured with steel or iron, these are generally considered to have been either orthopedic or novelty constructions and were not worn as part of mainstream fashion, although some dress historians believe that they were not worn at all.

==18th century==
The most common type of corset in the 18th century was an inverted conical shape, often worn to create a contrast between a rigid quasi-cylindrical torso above the waist and heavy full skirts below. The primary purpose of 18th-century stays was to shape the torso into a fashionable &#x27;V&#x27; or cone shape, slightly tapering the waist and creating an upright shoulders-back posture. 

&quot;Jumps&quot; of quilted linen were also worn instead of stays for informal situations or by those who needed more freedom of movement to work. Jumps were partially boned or boned with cord instead of whalebone, and padded with cotton to provide support for the breasts while not being restrictive. Jumps were made of silk, cotton, or linen and often embroidered. Jumps fastened over the breasts with ties, buttons, or metal hooks. Both garments were considered undergarments, and would be worn outwardly only under very limited circumstances. Stays were considered more respectable than jumps, as described in an anonymous aphorism dating to 1762: &quot;Now a shape in neat stays, now a slattern in jumps.&quot; This phrase continued to be referenced through the end of the 19th century, although the term &quot;stays&quot; largely fell out of fashion.
== Late 18th and early 19th century ==
During and shortly following the French Revolution, rationalists and classicists criticized the glorification of an artificial body shape, created by stays, as more beautiful than the natural human form. Fashion trended towards loose, thin dresses which resembled the shift dresses worn as undergarments by previous generations. Doctors and philosophers promoted the beauty of the natural female waist, and criticized the effect of wearing stays on female health as well as the health of the fetus, when worn during gestation. By the 1770s, &quot;short stays&quot; became the fashion. These garments did not extend beyond the chest area and had little to no boning, instead serving to create a fashionable &quot;shelf&quot; shape for the bust. Short stays were appropriate to wear beneath the empire silhouette gowns of the period, which were loose and unrestrictive below the chest and created a long, columnar line which referenced the clothing of Ancient Greece and Rome. This style of dress was called &quot;robe à la grecque&quot;. Lightly boned stays were still worn for formal occasions, but it was acceptable to forego them, even at highly formal settings such as at the royal court.

==Late Regency and early Victorian period==
By the 1820s, the empire silhouette fell out of fashion and what we now recognize as corsets returned, along with the elaborate, structured gowns associated with the Victorian era. Along with the change in trends, the industrialization of the garment industry meant that by the 1830s, steel boning had started to replace the classic whalebone. The advent of steel boning, as well as metal clasps and eyelets, meant that these corsets could be tightened significantly tighter than the stays of the 18th century without damaging the garment. In addition, the manufacture of stays was turned over to the assembly line. Prior to this era, each corset was hand made by one person from start to finish, either at home or by individual craftsmen, called staymakers. By the 19th century, most corsets were made in factories, and each step was performed by a different group of people, often children. Heavy or messy work was done in house, such as cutting the fabric pieces and lacquering the steels to prevent rust, and lighter work, such as sewing the bones in place, was taken home by piece workers, generally women who enlisted their children to help them. 

The diarist Emily Eden recorded that she had to obtain a silver &quot;husk&quot; before accompanying her brother to India because a humid climate rusted the usual steel and spoilt the garment. In 1839, a Frenchman by the name of Jean Werly made a patent for women&#x27;s corsets made on the loom. As seen in various fashion advertisements of the era, the common corset cost one dollar ($1).

==Mid- to Late-Victorian era==
The dress reform movement of the 1850s and 1860s opposed corsets and advocated against their use, particularly the high-fashion trend of tightlacing to achieve ever-smaller waistlines. While support for fashionable dress contested that corsets maintained an upright, ‘good figure’, as a necessary physical structure for moral and well-ordered society, dress reformists contested that women’s fashions were not only physically detrimental but “the results of male conspiracy to make women subservient by cultivating them in slave psychology.” They believed a change in fashions could change the position of women, allowing for more social mobility, independence from men and marriage, the ability to work for wages, and better physical movement and comfort.

The corset controversy was also closely tied to notions of social Darwinism and eugenics. The anxiety surrounding the damaged uterus, ovaries, and fetus were frequently pointed to as a danger to the &quot;race&quot; (i.e., European race). Western women were thought to be weaker and more prone to birth complications than the ostensibly more vigorous, healthier, &quot;primitive&quot; races who did not wear corsets. Dress reformers exhorted readers to reform the corset, or risk destroying the &quot;civilized&quot; races. On the other hand, those who argued for the importance of corsets cited Darwinism as well, specifically the notion that women were less evolved and thus frailer, in need of the support of a corset.   

In 1873 Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote:

Along with dress reformists, doctors criticized the trends in corsets. Reformists claimed that lifelong corset-wearing had a variety of health risks. Obstetricians of this period connected lifelong corset-wearing to the difficult births that many Victorian women experienced. In particular, the use of corsets during pregnancy was widely condemned, with physician Alice Bunker Stockham writing sardonically: &quot;The corset should not be worn for two hundred years before pregnancy takes place.&quot; 

Despite these protests, the corset did not fall out of fashion for many decades. However, corset manufacturers responded to the public health outcry by offering a variety of corsets which promoted &quot;hygiene&quot; (referring to the general health of the body, not cleanliness), introducing features such as elastic, buttons instead of metal clasps, or more lightweight fabrics, which became highly popular. Roxey Ann Caplin was a noted corset designer who consulted her husband, a physician and anatomist, to create more anatomically forgiving corsets for a variety of situations, including maternity.
==Edwardian and Post-Edwardian era==
As discussed in the previous sections, health concerns around the usage of corsets led to the development of &quot;hygienic&quot; corsets which purported to be less harmful to the wearer&#x27;s health. A number of doctors themselves became corsetieres, either fitting their patients into corsets or even going into the corset-making trade themselves. Inès Gâches-Sarraute, a female doctor who was interested in the corset, is credited with creating the straight-fronted busk corset to address gynecological problems her patients suffered. This design, seen on the left, purported to reduce pressure on the wearer&#x27;s abdomen. The new silhouette became the mode by the late 1890s.

Along with a change to the pattern and structure of the corset, the S-bend silhouette also necessitated a change in posture, requiring the wearer to adopt a lordotic or swayback stance to conform to the shape of the corset and avoid crumpling the flexible bones inside. The straight-front corset could be paired with bum, hip, and bust pads to create a fashionably exaggerated silhouette.

From 1908 to 1914, the fashionable narrow-hipped and narrow-skirted silhouette necessitated the lengthening of the corset at its lower edge. Meanwhile, as bras began to catch on in the 1910s, fewer and fewer corsets included bust support. A new type of corset covered the thighs and changed the position of the hip, making the waist appear higher and wider and the hips narrower, forecasting the &quot;flapper&quot; silhouette of the 1920s. The new fashion was considered uncomfortable, cumbersome, and required the use of strips of elastic fabric. The development of rubberized elastic materials in 1911 helped the girdle replace the corset. However, these garments were better known as girdles, and had the express purpose of reducing the hips in size. 

==Post-World War I==
A return to waist nipping corsets in 1939 caused a stir in fashion circles but World War II ended their return as women entered the workforce en masse and material shortages again became widespread, necessitating sleeker, more utilitarian designs. 

== Post-World War II ==
In 1952, a corset known as &#x27;The Merry Widow&#x27; was released by Warner&#x27;s. Initially, the Merry Widow was a trademark of the famous Maidenform company, which designed it for Lana Turner&#x27;s role in a 1952 movie of the same name. The Merry Widow differed from earlier corsets in that it separated the breasts, whereas corsets had held them together. 

Both corsets and girdles remained popular throughout the 1950s and 1960s, especially with the creation of Christian Dior&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot; in 1947. The &quot;New Look&quot; silhouette featured full skirts and nipped-in waists which appealed to the nostalgia of post-World War II America. The style contrasted sharply from the more utilitarian styles that had been needed during wartime, when women entered the workforce en masse and fashion houses faced widespread fabric shortages. The glamorous Dior designs symbolized a return to femininity under post-war American prosperity.

== Late 20th century and onwards ==
By the 1960s, the advent of hippie culture and youth rebellion led the wasp-waisted silhouette to fall out of favor. Feminist activists protested against the restrictive nature of Dior&#x27;s designs. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a &quot;Freedom Trash Can.&quot; These included girdles and corsets, which were among items the protestors called &quot;instruments of female torture&quot;. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of popular fitness culture. Dieting, plastic surgery (modern liposuction was invented in the mid-1970s), and exercise became the preferred methods of achieving a thin waist. The sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s brought with it midriff-revealing styles like the crop top, and many women chose to forgo supportive undergarments like girdles or corsets, preferring a more athletic figure.

The corset has largely fallen out of mainstream fashion since the 1920s in Europe and North America, replaced by girdles and elastic brassieres, but has survived as an article of costume. Originally an item of lingerie, the corset has become a popular item of outerwear in the fetish, BDSM, and Goth subcultures. In the fetish and BDSM literature, there is often much emphasis on tightlacing, and many corset makers cater to the fetish market. Women associated with the goth and punk subcultures experimented with corsets as outerwear, reclaiming the sexual symbolism and fetishistic, sadomasochistic associations of the garment. In the 1970s, high-fashion punk designer Vivienne Westwood began to incorporate corsets with printed designs. In the 1980s, other haute couture designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler began to experiment with corsets. 

In the early 2020s, corset-inspired tops and dresses began to trend as part of the regencycore aesthetic, inspired by television series like &quot;Bridgerton&quot; and &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;. These designs only superficially resemble corsets and typically do not incorporate any form of boning.

<text>The eulachon ( (Thaleichthys pacificus), also spelled oolichan , ooligan , hooligan ), or the candlefish, is a small anadromous species of smelt that spawns in some of the major river systems along the Pacific coast of North America from northern California to Alaska.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;candlefish&quot; derives from it being so fatty during spawning, with up to 15% of the total body weight in fat, that if caught, dried, and strung on a wick, it can be burned as a candle. This is the name most often used by early explorers. The name &quot;eulachon&quot; (occasionally seen as oolichan, ooligan, oulachon, and uthlecan) is from the Chinookan language and the Chinook Jargon based on that language. One of several theories for the origin of the name of the state of Oregon is that it was a corruption from the term &quot;Oolichan Trail&quot;, the native trade route for oolichan oil.
In some parts it is also known as &quot;halimotkw&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;savior fish&quot; or &quot;salvation fish&quot;, due to its availability for fishing often coming at the end of winter, when food supplies typically run low.

The unrelated sablefish &quot;Anoplopoma fimbria&quot; is also called &quot;candlefish&quot; in the United Kingdom.

==Species description==

Eulachon are distinguished by the large canine-like teeth on the vomer bone and 19 to 31 rays in the anal fin. Like salmon and trout they have an adipose fin (aft of the dorsal); it is sickle-shaped. The paired fins are longer in male fish than in females. All fins have well-developed breeding tubercles (raised tissue &quot;bumps&quot;) in ripe males, but these are poorly developed or absent in females. Adult coloration is brown or blue on the back extending to the top of the head, lighter to silvery white or light blue on the sides, and white on the ventral surface; speckling is extra fine, sparse, and restricted to the back. Adults can reach maximum lengths of but most adults are between . Adults have striae on their operculum that aid in distinguishing &quot;Thaleichthys pacificus&quot; from other smelt. They feed on plankton but only while at sea.

==Ecology==
Eulachon feed primarily on plankton as well as fish eggs, insect larvae, ocean debris and small crustaceans. It forms an important part of the diet of many ocean and shore predators, and serves as a prominent food source for people living near its spawning streams.

Eulachon, as anadromous fish, spend most of their adult lives in the ocean but return to their natal freshwater streams and rivers to spawn and die. As such, one stream may see regular large runs of eulachon while a neighboring stream sees few or none at all. Regular annual runs are common but not entirely predictable, and occasionally a river which has large runs sees a year with no returns; the reasons for such variability are not known. The eulachon run is characteristic for the early portion being almost entirely male, with females following about midway through the run to its conclusion. Males are easily distinguished from females during spawning by fleshy ridges which form along the length of their bodies.

==Economics and trade==
Indigenous communities of the Pacific Coast from California to Alaska made eulachon an important part of their diet, as well as a valuable trade item with peoples whose territories did not include spawning rivers. The species was caught using traps, rakes, and nets. The harvest continues today, with other residents taking part in the exploitation of the large runs. Today harvested eulachon are typically stored frozen and thawed as needed. They may also be fried, dried, smoked, or canned. Eulachon were also processed for their rich oil. The usual process was to allow the fish to decompose (rot) for a week or more in a hole in the ground, then add boiling hot water and skim off the oil, which would rise to the surface, being less dense than water. Eulachon oil (also known as &quot;Eulachon grease&quot;) was traded with inland communities; as a result, the trails over which the trade was conducted came to be known as grease trails. Other uses of eulachon by non-Natives include bait for sportfishing and food for cats and dogs.

==Conservation status==
In November 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) received a petition from the Cowlitz Tribe to list a distinct population segment (DPS) of eulachon from Washington, Oregon, and California, (the so-called Southern DPS) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. (ESA). NMFS found that this petition presented enough information to warrant conducting a status review of the species. Based on the status review NMFS proposed listing this species as threatened on March 13, 2009. On March 16, 2010, NOAA announced that the Southern DPS of eulachon will be listed as threatened under the ESA, effective on May 17, 2010 (See: the &quot;Federal Register&quot; notice published on May 18, 2010, at 74 FR 3178). On September 6, 2017, the NMFS approved a recovery plan intended to serve as a blueprint for the protection and recovery of the southern Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of eulachon (&quot;Thaleichthys pacificus&quot;) using the best available science per the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.

In Canada, the Central Pacific Coast and Fraser River populations were classified as endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2011. At that time, the Nass / Skeena Rivers population was given threatened status, but this was downgraded to Special Concern status when the Nass / Skeena Rivers population was individually reassessed by COSEWIC in 2013. As of May 2023, a decision is pending on the listing of these populations under Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act.

Overall, the species faces multiple threats, including overharvest, pollution, loss of freshwater spawning habitat due to logging, diversion and dam construction and climate change. Canadian spawning runs have been severely depleted compared to historic levels, while abrupt declines were reported in the Columbia, Fraser and Klinaklini rivers in 1994.

<text>Dunnes Stores is an Irish multinational retail chain that primarily sells food, clothes and household wares.
It was founded by Ben Dunne in 1944.
In addition to its main customer base in Ireland, the chain also has operations in Spain. The format of most of the chain&#x27;s stores in Ireland involves a grocery supermarket operating alongside a clothing/textiles store, although some stores contain only textiles and some contain only a supermarket. The grocery side of the business does not operate outside of Ireland, save for a limited grocery range in the Spanish stores. The larger stores usually contain a café branded as either Café Sol or Dunnes Stores Café.

Dunnes Stores&#x27; original own brand of groceries was sold under the &quot;St Bernard&quot; brand introduced in 1956, becoming an Irish household name, but was rebranded as &quot;My Family Favourites&quot; in 2013.

The main domestic competitors in the supermarket business are Tesco, SuperValu, Lidl and Aldi. Since first opening, Dunnes Stores has consistently maintained a top-three market share in Ireland&#x27;s grocery market, formerly alongside Quinnsworth and currently alongside SuperValu and Tesco. Combined, Dunnes, Tesco and SuperValu currently account for approximately 70% of Ireland&#x27;s grocery market. Currently, Dunnes Stores is Ireland’s number one supermarket, holding this title since 2018. 

In clothing, their rivals include Penneys and Marks and Spencer. 
Dunnes collaborate for many clothing/home wares collections from a number of Irish designers such as Paul Costelloe, Padraic Harrington, Carolyn Donnelly, Joanne Hynes and Paul Galvin.
They also sell in-house clothing brands such as Savida and Gallery, along with their own Dunnes Stores brand of clothing.

==History==

===1940s–1950s===
Ben Dunne began his retail career as an employee at Anderson&#x27;s drapery shop in Drogheda, Ireland, in 1926. In the mid-1930s, Dunne moved to Roches Stores in Cork. He rose to become a senior buyer for Roches Stores. When he was asked to oversee Roches&#x27; entire drapery business, he agreed on condition that he receive a pay rise. The owners refused, noting that he would be earning more than any of them. Dunne decided to leave Roches Stores and set up his own business.

Dunne opened his first drapery shop on St Patrick’s Street, Cork on 31 March 1944, promising &quot;better value&quot; by offering goods at pre-war prices. 

Dunnes introduced its own-brand range in 1956, then branded as &quot;St Bernard&quot;, modelled on the Marks &amp; Spencer &quot;St Michael&quot; brand.

Through the 1950s, Dunne established stores in Wexford, Waterford, Limerick and Dublin, with the first Dublin shop being opened on Henry Street in 1957.

===1960s–1970s===

Dunne opened a large shop on South Great George&#x27;s Street, Dublin in 1960. This shop allowed customers to browse through items on racks before making a purchase, which was new to Irish retail.

Dunnes continued to expand during the 1960s, and in 1963, Dunne grouped his growing number of stores under a new corporate structure, Dunnes Holding Company, which took over ownership of the entire operation. He also set up a family trust at the same time, in part to ensure that the company remained family controlled.

In the middle of the decade Dunne sparked a new revolution in the Irish retail scene. Until then, the company&#x27;s stores had operated, like the country&#x27;s retail sector in general, in Ireland&#x27;s city centre. In 1965, however, Dunnes opened a store at Cornelscourt in what was then Ireland&#x27;s first out-of-town shopping centre. Although scoffed at by experts, who believed the company would fail at the new location, the Cornelscourt site was not only a success, but became one of the company&#x27;s flagship stores.

By the end of the 1960s, Dunnes operated 17 stores across Ireland. This increased to 19 by October 1971. The company remained intensely private and, despite an active advertising schedule, wary of publicity. As Ben Dunne explained, in what the &quot;Times&quot; described as a rare interview in 1971, &quot;If there is one thing I hate it is publicity. No one is allowed to write about Ben Dunne. The people I do not like are the people who talk about what they have done and the people who talk about what they are going to do.&quot; In that same interview, Dunne reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining family control of his business, saying: &quot;Public companies are like the government. The government has the privilege of spending money foolishly and public companies are no better.&quot;

In 1978, Dunnes purchased Crumlin Shopping Centre in Dublin, which had been built four years earlier with 41 units including 2 large units, and having Dunnes Stores as anchor.
Dunnes added its first store in Northern Ireland in 1971. The company continued to expand its retail business, and by the end of the 1970s, it had built up a network of more than 60 stores.

===1980s–1990s===

By the beginning of the 1980s, the company operated seven stores in Northern Ireland.

In 1980, Dunnes opened its first shop on the European continent, in Fuengirola in the Costa del Sol in Spain. The success of that venture led the company to begin construction on its second Spanish store the following year, which opened in Marbella.

By 1981, Dunnes Stores represented 66 locations, producing estimated sales revenues of some £200,000,000. Dunne, by then in his 70s, had succeeded in building his company into one of Ireland&#x27;s top ten firms. Dunne also had been joined by his five children, Frank, Margaret, Thérèse, Elizabeth, and, especially, youngest son Ben Dunne Jr. The company became swept up in political events in 1982 when Ben Dunne Jr. was kidnapped and held captive for several days by the IRA.

Ben Dunne Senior died of a heart attack at 4pm on 14 April 1983. Although the business was nominally handed to all five of his children, most of whom played an active role in the company&#x27;s operations, actual leadership of the company became the responsibility of his son, Ben Dunne Jr.

Dunnes expanded into England in 1986.

In 1990, Dunnes closed the drapery shop it had opened on South Great George&#x27;s Street in Dublin in 1960, which at the time had been one of Ireland&#x27;s first self-selection drapery shops.

Ben Dunne Jr.&#x27;s tenure as leader of the family business came to an end in 1992, when he was arrested for cocaine possession in a Florida hotel.
The resulting scandal led the other family members to oust their brother, resulting in a somewhat public battle among the otherwise publicity-shy family.
In order to quantify and document the financial dealings of her brother, Margaret Heffernan commissioned a report from Price Waterhouse accountants, which was eventually disclosed in the legal case between the Dunne siblings (and which eventually lead to the McCracken Tribunal). In the end, the company paid IR£100 million to buy out Ben Dunne Jr.&#x27;s share of the business. The family faced other tragedies, as sisters Thérèse and Elizabeth both died at relatively young ages.
In the meantime, the alleged unorthodoxy of Ben Dunne Jr.&#x27;s business practices, which included funnelling Dunnes Stores funds into the offshore bank accounts of a number of Irish political figures, brought the company once again into the limelight in the late-1990s. The resulting political scandal had an additional consequence for the very private company, when the government announced in 1997 that it would appoint an authorised officer to inquire into the company&#x27;s business practices under Ben Dunne Jr.

Dunnes faced other difficulties as well during the decade. The UK retail giant Tesco had entered the Irish market and gained steadily, taking the number one retail spot from Dunnes. At the same time, a new breed of deep-discount supermarket, led by the German Aldi and Lidl chains, had arrived in Ireland, placing Dunnes&#x27; own discount formula under pressure.

===2000s–2020s===
By March 2000, Dunnes had some 119 outlets, with 81 in the Republic of Ireland, 26 in Northern Ireland, 9 in Great Britain and 3 in Spain.

Dunnes expanded into the Scottish market in 2000, opening a shop in Glasgow. It announced its intention to boost the number of Dunnes stores in the United Kingdom by up to 25, by 2005.

In 2000, the business re-opened its unit on South Great George&#x27;s Street in Dublin, this time as a grocery shop in a new format, adapting the American-style convenience store concept for the Dublin market. By 2001, the company had opened a second store featuring the smaller format and had registered a new subsidiary name, Better Value Conveniently Yours Ltd., in what some observers saw as the company&#x27;s intent on expanding its convenience store operations. In the meantime, Dunnes continued to open new stores, bringing its total to 125 stores. It opened its 126th shop on Henry Street in Limerick on 20 November 2001, again with a focus on convenience, &quot;heat and eat&quot;, products in its grocery shop on the ground floor, with its drapery department located upstairs.

The company was said to have held buyout talks in 2000 with U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart, which had expressed an interest in entering Ireland. The Dunne family, however, declined and decided to retain control of their business.

In 2003, the Irish government appointed an authorised officer to look into Dunnes Stores&#x27; records. While the results of that investigation were to remain private, it nevertheless represented a new intrusion for the company&#x27;s carefully guarded privacy. That same desire for privacy had reportedly led the company to quash a story slated to appear about Dunnes Stores in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, which allegedly chose not to run the story in order to safeguard the yearly €1.6 million in advertising revenues provided by Dunnes Stores.

In 2007, Dunnes refurbished its shop at Henry Street, Dublin. Also in 2007, architect Arthur Gibney &amp; Partners designed a large commercial development on South Great George&#x27;s Street, Dublin as Headquarters for Dunnes Stores, which entailed the removal of some buildings and facade retention of several others, including the former Dunlop Factory on Stephen Street, and the Connolly Shoes building. The building has a dramatic glass corner atrium leading to an internal street through the development. The facade to George&#x27;s Street respects existing building heights.

The company owns 50% of the Asian fast-food chain, Neon.
In spring 2018, Dunnes Stores confirmed the closure of all stores in England and Scotland, limiting their UK presence to Northern Ireland only.

In 2018, Dunnes Stores commenced with a number of substantial refurbishments and expansions on some of its stores, including its stores in Bishopstown and Ballyvolane in Cork and in a number of stores in Dublin including Donaghmede, Blanchardstown and Swords. The refurbished supermarkets now contain a number of concessions including James Whelan Butchers, Sheridan&#x27;s Cheesemongers and Baxter &amp; Greene Markets Delis.

In 2019, new stores opened in Naas, Ilac Centre and the refurbishment of stores in the Jetland and Briarhill. Also in 2019, Dunnes Stores celebrated 75 years of business. The refurbished Jetland store included Dunnes Stores&#x27;s first beauty department.

In 2023, Dunnes Stores opened a new store in Point Square, Dublin. It also extensively refurbished its Henry Street store for a second time. 

Dunnes Stores introduced a voucher scheme known as “Shop &amp; Save”, whereby customers who spend between €25 and €50 receive a €5 voucher for their next shop, and customers who spend €50 or more receive a €10 voucher for their next shop. This has earned Dunnes Stores a loyal customer following. 

In March 2020, Dunnes Stores introduced priority shopping for the elderly and vulnerable between 11:00-13:00, in response to the high volume of customer traffic in the mornings, a result from the COVID-19 pandemic where panic buying became an issue across Ireland.

==Controversies==

===South Africa boycott===
In 1984, Mary Manning, a shop worker in the Henry Street, Dublin branch, made international headlines when she led a picket for almost three years against the sale by Dunnes of oranges sourced from South Africa, then governing under a system of apartheid, in which Ewan MacColl wrote a song about the issue. The Irish Government eventually banned all imports from South Africa until the end of apartheid, which happened between 1991-94. The workers eventually met African National Congress leader and political prisoner Nelson Mandela on the occasion of his conferral of the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1990. A plaque presented by President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki, commemorating the action, was unveiled in Dublin in June 2008, and a street has been named after Mary in Johannesburg. Manning was invited to attend the Funeral of Nelson Mandela in 2013.

===Bras for children===
In September 2011, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; found that Dunnes Stores was selling bra-and-knicker sets for three to six-year-old girls. Dunnes also has padded bras for girls with a 28 to 30-inch chest, which are the typical measurements of nine-year-old girls.

===Burma boycott===
An attempted boycott was made on Dunnes due to reports of selling goods made in Burma.

===Mandate dispute===
On 2 April 2015, members of the Mandate Trade Union had a one-day dispute at 109 branches of Dunnes Stores. The dispute concerned low-hour contracts (typically 15 hours per week), income and employment security, and the continued failure of Dunnes Stores to recognise or engage with the Mandate Trade Union, contrary to the recommendations of the Labour Court.

<doc id="958480" wikidata="Q3034226" url="?curid=958480" title="Gus Savage">
<text>Augustus Alexander &quot;Gus&quot; Savage (October 30, 1925 – October 31, 2015) was an American entrepreneur, publisher and a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois. He served six terms from 1981 to 1993.

==Early life and career==
Savage was born in Detroit, Michigan, and graduated from Roosevelt University in Chicago. He served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1946 and then worked as a journalist from 1954 to 1979, owning a chain of weekly community newspapers in the Chicago area including the South End Citizen. The Chicago Citizen Newspaper Group became the largest Black-owned chain of weekly newspapers in the Midwest with a circulation of 121,000.

== Congress ==
Savage entered political life in 1948 as a Progressive Party organizer.

He challenged the local establishment&#x27;s chosen candidates for the House of Representatives in 1968 and 1970, losing the Democratic primary both times, but won election to the House in 1980, representing the 2nd District on Chicago&#x27;s South Side for 6 terms, from January 1981 to January 1993.

In 1983 he joined with 7 other Congressional Representatives to sponsor a resolution to impeach Ronald Reagan over his sudden and unexpected invasion of Grenada.

=== Controversies ===
In 1989, Savage was accused of trying to force himself on a female Peace Corps worker in Zaire. He denied the allegations and blamed them on the &quot;racist press.&quot; The House Ethics Committee decided that the events did indeed occur, but it did not take disciplinary action only because Savage wrote a letter of apology.

Savage had long been controversial even in his own district. His racially incendiary and anti-Semitic remarks frequently drew bipartisan criticism. He never won a primary election–the real contest in this overwhelmingly Democratic district–with more than 52% of the vote, and usually faced multiple challengers.

=== Redistricting and defeat ===
For the 1992 election, redistricting pushed his district further into Chicago&#x27;s south suburbs, territory that Savage did not know and that did not know him. He faced a rematch with Mel Reynolds, who had challenged him in the 1988 and 1990 primaries. Savage claimed that &quot;racist Jews&quot; were donating to Reynolds, while Reynolds claimed that Savage was involved in a drive-by shooting that injured him. Although Savage accused Reynolds of staging the shooting, he lost the 1992 election to Reynolds by a margin of 63%-37% after voters in the suburban portion of the district voted 4-to-1 for Reynolds. In defeat Savage declared, &quot;We have lost to the white racist press and to the racist reactionary Jewish misleaders.&quot;

=== Role in national historic landmark ===
In one of his final acts as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, excavation and construction at the site of the African Burial Ground in New York City was temporarily halted in 1992, pending further evaluation by the General Services Administration, after Savage was able to leverage his reputation as a national political figure to bring attention to the potential importance of the site. The site was eventually designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993 and a National Monument in 2006 by President George W. Bush.

== Final years ==
During the last 5 years of his life, Congressman Savage hired private security, and Jokarhi Shakur-El (former Minister of Intelligence of the New Black Panther Party) was his Chief of Security. He drove the Congressman and his belongings from Washington, D.C. to Chicago, Illinois. While living in the Hyde Park area (just 5 minutes from the Chicago home of Barack Obama) Gus was being cared for by Linda Muhammad, a long-time friend of Gus, and he was at that point seemingly healthy. On October 29, 2015, Gus was discharged from the hospital after some minor issues, and placed into the care of his son Thomas Savage.

=== Death ===
On October 30, 2015, Congressman Savage celebrated his 90th birthday, and he died the following day on October 31, 2015. He is survived by his son Thomas Savage, daughter Dr. Emma Savage, and grandchildren Thomas Savage Jr., Chyella McBride, and Alexandria Savage.

<doc id="958481" wikidata="Q2961963" url="?curid=958481" title="Cheesehead">
<text>Cheesehead is a nickname in the United States for a person from Wisconsin or for a fan of the Green Bay Packers.

==Background==
Wisconsin is associated with cheese because the state historically produced more dairy products than other American states, giving it the nickname &quot;America&#x27;s Dairyland&quot;. The use of the term &quot;Cheesehead&quot; as a derogatory word for Wisconsinites originated with Illinois football and baseball fans to refer to opposing Wisconsin sports fans. The term, however, was quickly embraced by Wisconsinites and is now a point of pride.

==Other uses==
During World War II, German soldiers mockingly referred to the Dutch as cheeseheads because of the Netherlands&#x27; extensive dairy farming industry. The Dutch term &quot;kaaskop&quot;, literally &quot;cheese head&quot;, is considered a profanity to refer to a person as stupid or dense.

In the 1969 novel &quot;Papillon&quot;, the term was used to describe the unsophisticated jurors who voted to convict the main character.

==Cheesehead hat==
Rose Bruno first saw a cardboard &quot;Cheesehead&quot; hat at a Milwaukee Brewers vs. Chicago White Sox game in Chicago in 1987 worn by fellow Milwaukeean Amerik Wojciechowski. Ralph Bruno later made the first one out of foam while he was cutting up his mother&#x27;s couch. It was made popular by centerfielder Rick Manning, who saw the hat while playing. Bruno started a multi-million-dollar business to sell the hats as novelties. The &quot;Cheesehead&quot; trademark is owned by Foamation, Inc. of St. Francis, Wisconsin, which began manufacture of the wearable, foam &quot;Cheesehead&quot; in 1987. Along with the original Cheesehead &quot;wedge&quot;, Foamation has made other similar &quot;cheese&quot; apparel, including baseball caps, cowboy hats, and earrings. In 2023, Bruno sold Foamation to the Green Bay Packers, making the Cheesehead official Packers merchandise.

The Cheesehead gained attention in 1995, when Packers fan Frank Emmert Jr. was flying on a private plane back to Wisconsin after attending a Packers game against the Cleveland Browns and the plane crashed due to ice accumulation. Emmert suffered a broken ankle and other minor injuries but was saved from further serious injury when he used his Cheesehead for protection in the crash. In 2013, sports fans of Chicago replied to their rivals by wearing cheese graters.

Cheesehead hats have evolved beyond sports to become a cultural and political symbol of Wisconsin. Notably, Wisconsin delegates wore Cheesehead hats at both the 2024 Republican National Convention and the 2024 Democratic National Convention to represent their state.

<text>vMac is a free and open-source Macintosh Plus emulator which is able to run versions of System 1.1 to 7.5.5. It is available for Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac OS, NeXTSTEP, Linux, Unix, and other platforms. Although vMac has been abandoned, &quot;Mini vMac&quot;, an improved spinoff of vMac, is still actively developed.

vMac and Mini vMac support CPU emulation from Motorola 68000 to 68040, display output, sound, floppy disk insert, HFV image files, and more. Some vMac ports include extra features such as CD-ROM support, basic serial port (SCC) support, Gemulator ROM board support, and various performance improvements. Although the website is still in operation, most vMac development slowed to a halt in 1999, and no official releases have been made since. Many of the developer e-mail addresses listed on the website are not currently working.

== Overview ==

Mini vMac, vMac&#x27;s spinoff, is still being maintained and developed by Paul C. Pratt. Currently Mini vMac supports Macintosh 128K, 512K, 512Ke, Plus, SE and Classic, with active development for Macintosh II, Macintosh Portable and PowerBook 100 support. Due to complaints about the rarity of the original II, it also accepts Macintosh IIx and Macintosh SE/30 ROM files.

vMac and Mini vMac require a Macintosh Plus ROM file and Macintosh system software to work. Macintosh ROM files are owned by Apple and cannot be legally distributed. However, the Windows and Unix ports of vMac (not Mini vMac) support the Gemulator ROM board from Emulators Inc., which allows users to add genuine MacPlus ROM chips to their x86 machine via an ISA expansion slot. This board can also support ROM chips from other early Macintosh systems, but the publicly released versions of vMac only supported the Macintosh Plus. Macintosh system software is available from Apple&#x27;s Support Downloads Website.

As mentioned, Mini vMac also requires a specific ROM image for the computer emulation desired. A software application for these 68000 Macs may be downloaded from the Mini vMac website for retrieval of a system&#x27;s ROM image, along with a complete tutorial for locating an old Mac, retrieving the ROM and working with disk images.

<doc id="958497" wikidata="Q1198604" url="?curid=958497" title="The Flying Circus of Physics">
<text>The Flying Circus of Physics by Jearl Walker (1975, published by John Wiley and Sons; &quot;with Answers&quot; in 1977; 2nd edition in 2007), is a book that poses and answers 740 questions that are concerned with everyday physics. There is a strong emphasis upon phenomena that might be encountered in one&#x27;s daily life. The questions are interspersed with 38 &quot;short stories&quot; about related material.

The book covers topics relating to motion, fluids, sound, thermal processes, electricity, magnetism, optics, and vision.

There is a website for the book which stores over 11,000 references, 2,000 links, new material, a detailed index, and other supplementary material. There is also a collection of YouTube videos by the author on the material. See External links at the bottom of this page.

Jearl Walker is a professor of physics at Cleveland State University. He is also known for his work on the highly popular textbook of introductory physics, Fundamentals of Physics, which is currently in its 12th edition. From 1978 until 1990, Walker wrote The Amateur Scientist column in Scientific American magazine.

==Examples==
Typically, the questions posed by the book are about everyday phenomena that most people do not think about. For example, here is question 4.78, &quot;A Candle Flame&quot;:

Note that this question is actually a series of closely related sub-questions. This is often the case. Here is another example; this one is an excerpt from question 5.2, &quot;Lightning: People, cows, and sheep&quot;:

Here is a third example; this one is an excerpt from question 6.1, &quot;Rainbows&quot;:

Many of the short stories are descriptions of particular events. For example, item 1.54 is the short story &quot;Bomber crashes into Empire State Building.&quot; The story describes how this actually occurred in 1945 and what happened to the bomber, the building, and one of the elevators.

==History==
As is discussed in the preface of the book, the idea for the collection of real-world physics phenomena started when Jearl was a graduate student teaching assistant, and was asked by a student to give an example of how physics had anything to do with her life. The collection grew steadily over time, and he gave it a name that he thought would attract attention. Eventually it became large enough and popular enough to justify publication. The original 1975 edition provided no answers to the questions, but did provide references to use as a starting point. This was followed in 1977 by a modified 1st edition that included a section at the back with answers or partial answers to the questions. The author continued to work on the project and 31 years later, in 2006, the 2nd edition was released. It is a major expansion of the material and the answers now immediately follow the questions. The references for the 2nd edition are kept in an online website (see External links below) along with other useful material. The book has been translated and published in 11 different languages, the colorful covers of which can be seen here.

==Reception==
The various editions of the book all received highly favorable reviews.

The reviews make it clear that the book poses questions about the real world that most readers will find interesting and which present challenges at all levels of expertise from high school science student to professional physicist.

Edward Adelson, physicist at Ohio State University writes of the 2nd edition: &quot;Jearl Walker, known for writing of exceptional clarity in his editions of Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick, and Walker, has offered us a new, expanded version of The Flying Circus of Physics, his collection of natural phenomena and physics oddities. ... This book, full of examples you will want to think through or discuss with friends, also includes phenomena that have not yet been fully tested or explained. It is easy for a physicist to become immersed in this book and ignore colleagues, spouse, children, and earthquakes.&quot;

A staff writer for Goodreads said in a review of the 2nd edition: &quot;Wiley published the first edition of Jearl Walker’s The Flying Circus of Physics, which has sold over 100,000 copies and become a cult classic in the physics community. The Flying Circus is a compendium of interesting real world phenomena that can be explained using basic laws of physics. This new edition represents a thorough updating and modernization of the book. The new edition gives us the opportunity to highlight Jearl’s creativity, his communication skills, and his ability to make physics interesting.&quot;

Thomas E Taylor, at the University of Arizona, says in a review of the 1st edition (with answers), &quot;Jearl Walker&#x27;s &#x27;Flying Circus of Physics&#x27; is so fascinating that it is difficult to review. In 174 pages, no less than 618 &quot;just-for-fun&quot; problems are posed regarding things that we see in everyday life. ... While this little book comes with &#x27;physics&#x27; in the title, it obviously transcends that single science (if indeed it can be isolated). My students not only read it with enthusiasm, they also try out the things that are listed. And, with time, they resist looking at the answers until they have thoroughly experimented with each phenomenon.&quot;

Brian E Woolnough of University of Oxford says of the 1st edition (with answers)
&quot;Now and again there is published a book which comes like a breath of fresh air through the existing tomes in that field; such a book is The Flying Circus of Physics by Professor Jearl Walker - It is a delight to peruse. ... Having met Jearl Walker I know that he would hope that his book would make people realize that physics is not an irrelevant, esoteric art which is the sole preserve of those who communicate with advanced mathematics. On the contrary, there is physics all around us, and an appreciation of this can make the whole of our life more enjoyable and more fun.&quot;

Douglas D. Smith, a high school teacher, in a review of the 1st edition (without answers), says &quot;The book is especially valuable to a general science teacher but has many items that relate to high school chemistry. One successful use of the book was to give students the opportunity to choose one of the phenomena and find answers to the related questions by checking into the references.&quot;

In a review of the 1st edition (without answers), Robert H. Romer, a physics professor at Amherst College, says &quot;I recommend this book without reservation to everyone who enjoys physics, who knows the subject and who wants to learn more about its application to real phenomena. My major worry about the book is my fear that it might be mistaken for an &#x27;elementary&#x27; book. It is true that no quantum mechanics is needed, for instance, to grapple with these questions, but at least with many of these questions, you will not get far without a sound knowledge of classical physics.&quot;

<text>Ronald James Taylor (October 16, 1952 – January 16, 2002) was an American actor, singer and writer. He grew up in Galveston, Texas, and later moved to New York City to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. After graduating, Taylor began working in musical theater, appearing in &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1977), before getting his break with the 1982 off-Broadway production &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. Taylor voiced the killer plant Audrey II in the show, which ran for five years and over 2,000 performances.

Taylor created and starred in the musical revue &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot;, which charted the history of blues music from its African origin to American success. Originally performed at high schools in Denver as a 45-minute piece, the revue was expanded to two hours, played around the country and opened on Broadway in 1999. It was met with critical acclaim, ran for eight months, and saw Taylor receive two Tony Award nominations.

He also had numerous television roles, appearing in &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal, Matlock&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. His performance in the latter, as a singer who performed the American national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at baseball games, led him to perform the anthem at several real-life sporting events. Taylor was married and had one son. He died in January 2002 after suffering a heart attack.

==Early life==
Taylor was born on October 16, 1952, in Galveston, Texas to Marian and Robert &quot;Bruno&quot; Taylor and had two sisters, Roberta and Frances. He attended O&#x27;Connell High School, and Wharton County Junior College, where he was a football player, and a participant in the school choir and theater. The choir teacher suggested he join after overhearing him singing The Temptations. He favoured music over football, and at the age of 19 attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, intending to become a singer.

==Career==

===Theater===

====Early theater work====

Taylor, a &quot;barrel-chested bass-baritone&quot;, had an extensive career in musical theater. Upon graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Taylor was unable to read sheet music and could &quot;barely&quot; play the piano, but found work as a singer. In 1977 he played the Cowardly Lion in a national touring production of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. Taylor subsequently played Great Big Baby in the 1978 Broadway production &quot;Eubie!&quot; and Caiaphas in a performance of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

He voiced Audrey II, the &quot;street-smart, funky, conniving&quot; talking killer plant which is an &quot;anthropomorphic cross between a Venus flytrap and an avocado&quot;, in the original off-Broadway production of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken&#x27;s &quot;black-comedy musical&quot; &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; from 1982. Audrey II was played by four increasingly large puppets, operated by Martin P. Robinson, while Taylor sat in a box at the back of the stage to voice the role, standing to perform his musical numbers. The two kept in close proximity to ensure &quot;that voice and action are always synchronized&quot; and &quot;developed a rapport&quot; which was &quot;the only thing that allow[ed] the character to really bloom.&quot; Taylor disliked sitting in the box as it left him feeling disconnected from the audience. The part was his break and was described by Jesse McKinley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a role Mr. Taylor&#x27;s booming voice was made for...[he] soon put his stamp on Audrey&#x27;s signature line: &#x27;Feed me, feed me!&#x27;&quot; Members of the public often used the line when they saw Taylor. &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; was performed over 2000 times before it closed in 1987. At the 1983 Drama Desk Awards, Taylor won the award for Outstanding Special Effects for his performance, which he shared with Robinson.

In the 1984 Broadway production of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; at The Broadway Theatre, Taylor played Porthos, one of the three title characters. After fifteen preview performances, the show ran just nine times before closing. Frank Rich wrote that the musketeers were &quot;professionally played&quot; by Taylor and his co-stars Brent Spiner and Chuck Wagner but felt the three had &quot;little dialogue and often seem like interchangeable stand-ins for the Three Stooges.&quot; A similar view was held by William B. Collins of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; who said they &quot;speak as in one voice and behave like comedians who have been stranded without good material.&quot;

====&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot;====
Taylor created and starred in the musical revue &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot;, which charted the history of blues music from its African origin to American success. He conceived the original idea for the show when he played blues musician Rufus Payne in a 1987 production of &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, a play about singer Hank Williams at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts in Denver, Colorado. He proposed the idea to director Randal Myler who eventually accepted it in 1994. Taylor co-wrote the revue with Myler, Lita Gaithers, Charles Bevel and Dan Wheetman, and also served as its associate producer. Taylor was the revue&#x27;s lead singer and acted as its narrator; his numbers included &quot;I&#x27;m Your Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, &quot;The Thrill is Gone&quot;, &quot;Blues Man&quot; and &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;. It was initially performed as a 45-minute production at 25 local high schools. Because of their positive reception, the show was expanded to two hours and 50 songs, with three people being added to the original cast of four, and was regularly performed at the Denver Center.

Taylor described the performance as &quot;very cordial&quot;, with the audience close to performers, and that &quot;one show is never the same as the next because of the songs, of what they are. Blues is about how you feel today. One day, you&#x27;re down; another day is real happy and giddy. We&#x27;re all laughing. Randy&#x27;s direction captures that. It&#x27;s always so personal, bringing the audience into the piece.&quot; As well as African music, the revue includes &quot;country, gospel, the old blues, Appalachian music,&quot; featuring music by Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Rogers, Nina Simone and Muddy Waters.

In 1995, the revue ran for a month at the Cleveland Play House, in conjunction with the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, before touring at other regional theaters. It played at the Crossroads Theatre in New Jersey for seven weeks in November 1998 and opened off-Broadway at New York&#x27;s New Victory Theater in March 1999, presented by Crossroads Theatre, in association with San Diego Repertory Theatre and Alabama Shakespeare Festival. It was met with critical and audience acclaim and the following month moved to Broadway to the Vivian Beaumont Theater. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Lawrence Van Gelder wrote that the show had a &quot;cornucopia of splendidly interpreted song,&quot; and &quot;is a potent blend of visual eloquence and historical sweep that engages the eye and touches the heart while its songs soothe the ear, occasionally work mischief on the funny bone, and always raise the spirits.&quot;

A week after opening at the Beaumont, the show received four Tony Award nominations, with Taylor being nominated for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical and Best Book of a Musical. The cast&#x27;s performance on the live Tony Awards show on CBS was bumped due to limited time, sparking controversy, costing the show potential revenue, and damaging its prospects for survival. The cast performed two days later on the CBS talkshow &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, while media attention and radio coverage of the Tony snub boosted the show&#x27;s takings for the following two weeks. This did not last and did not &quot;build a long-lasting audience like the Tonys could&quot;, leading to dwindling attendance. A large word-of-mouth networking campaign to advertise the performance was set up by the producers and the show moved to the Ambassador Theatre, where the box office takes began to break even. The show closed in January 2000 after a total run of eight months on Broadway.

For the rest of the year, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot; again toured at regional theaters, running in Atlanta, San Diego, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and returning to New York in August 2000 at the B.B. King Blues Club and Grill for a month-long run. Jim Trageser of &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot;, in a review of one of the San Diego performances, praised Taylor, saying he &quot;has the lung power to simply take over any show, especially his own&quot; and &quot;shows surprising grace and athleticism as well as the kind of leonine masculinity that certain big men (Orson Welles, Babe Ruth) possess&quot;. Trageser also praised the writing, calling it &quot;a superb job not only of selecting the songs, but in choosing arrangements that blow away all the cobwebs history has laid on many of them.&quot;

&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot; was the longest-running show Taylor appeared in, as well as his final Broadway appearance. Taylor planned an IMAX film version of the production; and nine years after his death, it was revived by the New Harlem Arts Theater at the Aaron Davis Hall on the City College of New York campus.

===Film, television and music===
Taylor had numerous television roles. He voiced jazz musician &quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, appearing in the first season episode &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; (1990) and returning for the character&#x27;s death in the season six episode &#x27;Round Springfield&quot; (1995). He was one of the first people to guest star on the show. Taylor was supposed to reprise his role in the season two episode &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot;, but was in New York and unable to record his part. Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said the role gave Taylor &quot;television immortality&quot;. He also reprised the role on a recording of Billie Holiday&#x27;s song &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; on the 1990 &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ album &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot;. He appeared as a Klingon chef in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and played wrestling instructor Coach Wingate in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Other television roles included guest spots on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Taylor also had a recurring part in the 2000 series &quot;City of Angels&quot;, and played a blues singer in a two-part episode of &quot;Matlock&quot;, a role that was written for him. He also appeared in more than 20 films. These included &quot;Trading Places&quot;, &quot;Amos &amp; Andrew&quot;, &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot; (as Hank), &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot; and &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;.

After a 1991 appearance on the series &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, on which he played a singer sacked by a baseball team for &quot;embellish[ing]&quot; his performances of the American national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, Taylor received several invitations to sing it before sports events, although never expected anything to happen when he had taken the part. He sang it before the Major League Baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers on July 1, 1991. His rendition did not mimic that of his character: &quot;the song is self-explanatory. I&#x27;m just going to sing the song straightforwardly and that&#x27;s that.&quot; Taylor received travel and accommodation expenses but no other payment for his performance. He also sang for a Los Angeles Kings National Hockey League game, and on August 5, 1995, he sang the anthem before the MLB match between the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox.

Taylor was part of the blues group The Nervis Bros and performed across the United States. He also sang with Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Etta James, Slash and Sheila E.

==Personal life==
Taylor met DeBorah Sharpe in 1977 during the production of &quot;The Wiz&quot; where she was the understudy for Dorothy. They married in 1980 and had a son, Adamah. In his spare time, Taylor often helped teach vulnerable young people through a variety of projects, including at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey. He noted &quot;things have come out of the air for me...I&#x27;m grateful; that&#x27;s why I work with kids. I&#x27;ve had a blessing in my career, to have gone as far as I&#x27;ve gone.&quot; A 1995 piece in &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; described Taylor as &quot;A jolly giant of a man, he looks like a natural force – a mountain, perhaps, who can tell great stories.&quot; Taylor was a Christian.

Taylor suffered a small stroke in 1999; he was able to perform again in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot; 73 days later. He died from a heart attack at his home in Los Angeles on January 16, 2002, at the age of 49. His funeral took place on January 28 at the New Christ Memorial Church of God in Christ.

<doc id="958502" wikidata="Q1048478" url="?curid=958502" title="Shunga">
<text>is a type of Japanese erotic art typically executed as a kind of ukiyo-e, often in woodblock print format. While rare, there are also extant erotic painted handscrolls which predate ukiyo-e. Translated literally, the Japanese word &quot;shunga&quot; means &quot;picture of spring&quot;; &quot;spring&quot; is a common euphemism for sex.

Shunga, as a subset of ukiyo-e, was enjoyed by all social groups in the Edo period, despite being out of favor with the shogunate. The ukiyo-e movement sought to idealize contemporary urban living and appeal to the new chōnin class. Shunga followed the aesthetics of everyday life and widely varied in its depictions of sexuality. Most ukiyo-e artists made shunga at some point in their careers.

== History ==
Shunga was heavily influenced by illustrations in Chinese medicine manuals beginning in the Muromachi era (1336 to 1573). Zhou Fang, a notable Tang-dynasty Chinese painter, is also thought to have been influential. He, like many artists of his time, tended to draw genital organs in an oversized manner, similar to a common shunga topos. Besides &quot;shunga&quot; literally meaning a picture of spring (sex), the word is also a contraction of &quot;shunkyū-higi-ga&quot; (春宮秘戯画), the Japanese pronunciation for a Chinese set of twelve scrolls depicting the twelve sexual acts that the crown prince would perform as an expression of yin yang.

The Japanese influences of shunga date back to the Heian period (794 to 1185). At this point, it was found among the courtier class. Through the medium of narrative handscrolls, sexual scandals from the imperial court or the monasteries were depicted, and the characters tended to be limited to courtiers and monks.

The style reached its height in the Edo period (1603 to 1867). Thanks to woodblock printing techniques, the quantity and quality increased dramatically. There were repeated governmental attempts to suppress shunga, the first of which was an edict issued by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1661 banning, among other things, erotic books known as (literally &quot;lewdness books&quot;). While other genres covered by the edict, such as works criticising &quot;daimyōs&quot; or samurai, were driven underground by this edict, shunga continued to be produced with little difficulty.
The Kyōhō Reforms, a 1722 edict, were much more strict, banning the production of all new books unless the city commissioner gave permission. After this edict, shunga went underground. However, since for several decades following this edict, publishing guilds saw fit to send their members repeated reminders not to sell erotica, it seems probable that production and sales continued to flourish. Further attempts to prevent the production of shunga were made with the Kansei Reforms under Emperor Kōkaku in the 1790s.
According to Monta Hayakawa and C. Andrew Gerstle, westerners during the nineteenth century were less appreciative of shunga because of its erotic nature. In the journal of Francis Hall, an American businessperson who arrived in Yokohama in 1859, he described shunga as &quot;vile pictures executed in the best style Japanese art.&quot; Hayakawa stated that Hall was shocked and disgusted when on two occasions his Japanese acquaintances and their wives showed him shunga at their homes. Shunga also faced problems in Western museums in the twentieth century; Peter Webb reported that while engaged in research for a 1975 publication, he was initially informed that no relevant material existed in the British Museum, and when finally allowed access to it, he was told that it &quot;could not possibly be exhibited to the public&quot; and had not been catalogued. In 2014 he revisited the museum, which had an exhibition entirely of shunga &quot;proudly displayed&quot;.

The introduction of Western culture and technologies at the beginning of the Meiji era (1868–1912), particularly the importation of photo-reproduction techniques, had serious consequences for shunga. For a time, woodblock printing continued to be used, but figures began to appear in prints wearing Western clothing and hairstyles. Eventually, shunga could no longer compete with erotic photography, leading to its decline.

The art of shunga provided an inspiration for the Shōwa (1926–1989) and Heisei (1989–2019) art in Japanese video games, anime and manga known in the Western world as hentai and known formally in Japan as &quot;jū hachi kin&quot; (adult-only, literally &quot;18-restricted&quot;). Like shunga, hentai is sexually explicit in its imagery.

== Uses ==
Shunga was probably enjoyed by both men and women of all classes. Superstitions and customs surrounding shunga suggest as much; in the same way that it was considered a lucky charm against death for a samurai to carry shunga, it was considered a protection against fire in merchant warehouses and the home. From this we can deduce that samurai, chonin, and housewives all owned shunga. All three of these groups would suffer separation from the opposite sex; the samurai lived in barracks for months at a time, and conjugal separation resulted from the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system and the merchants&#x27; need to travel to obtain and sell goods. It is therefore argued that this ownership of shunga was not superstitious, but libidinous.

Records of women obtaining shunga themselves from booklenders show that they were consumers of it. Though not shunga, it was traditional to present a bride with ukiyo-e depicting scenes from the Tale of Genji. Shunga may have served as sexual guidance for the sons and daughters of wealthy families. The instructional purpose has been questioned since the instructional value of shunga is limited by the impossible positions and lack of description of technique, and there were sexual manuals in circulation that offered clearer guidance, including advice on hygiene.

Shunga varied greatly in quality and price. Some were highly elaborate, commissioned by wealthy merchants and &quot;daimyōs&quot;, while some were limited in colour, widely available, and cheap. Empon were available through the lending libraries, or kashi-honya, that travelled in rural areas. This tells us that shunga reached all classes of society—peasant, &quot;chōnin&quot;, samurai and &quot;daimyōs&quot;.

== Production ==

Shunga were produced between the sixteenth century and the nineteenth century by ukiyo-e artists, since they sold more easily and at a higher price than their ordinary work. Shunga prints were produced and sold either as single sheets or—more frequently—in book form, called &quot;enpon&quot;. These customarily contained twelve images, a tradition with its roots in Chinese shunkyu higa. Shunga was also produced in hand scroll format, called kakemono-e (掛け物絵). This format was also popular, though more expensive as the scrolls had to be individually painted.

The quality of shunga art varies, and few ukiyo-e painters remained aloof from the genre. Experienced artists found it to their advantage to concentrate on their production. This led to the appearance of &quot;shunga&quot; by renowned artists, such as the &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; painter perhaps best known in the Western world, Hokusai (see &quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot; from the series ). Ukiyo-e artists owed a stable livelihood to such customs, and producing a piece of &quot;shunga&quot; for a high-ranking client could bring them sufficient funds to live on for about six months. Among others, the world-famous Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama uses his special hand brush painting technique and hanko stamp signature method in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to create modern day shunga art in the same tradition of the past artists like Hokusai.

Full-colour printing, or nishiki-e, developed around 1765, but many &quot;shunga&quot; prints predate this. Prior to this, colour was added to monochrome prints by hand, and from 1744 benizuri-e allowed the production of prints of limited colours. Even after 1765 many shunga prints were produced using older methods. In some cases this was to keep the cost low, but in many cases this was a matter of taste.

Shunga produced in Edo tended to be more richly coloured than those produced in Kyoto and Osaka, mainly owing to a difference in aesthetic taste between these regions—Edo has a taste for novelty and luxury, while the kamigata region preferred a more muted, understated style. This also translates into a greater amount of background detail in Edo Shunga.

After 1722 most artists refrained from signing shunga works. However, between 1761 and 1786 the implementation of printing regulations became more relaxed, and many artists took to concealing their name as a feature of the picture (such as calligraphy on a fan held by a courtesan) or allusions in the work itself (such as Utamaro&#x27;s empon entitled &quot;Utamakura&quot;).

== Content ==

Edo period shunga sought to express a varied world of contemporary sexual possibilities. Some writers on the subject refer to this as the creation of a world parallel to contemporary urban life, but idealised, eroticised and fantastical.

=== Characters ===
By far the majority of shunga depict the sexual relations of the ordinary people, the &quot;chōnin&quot;, the townsmen, women, merchant class, artisans and farmers. Occasionally there also appear Dutch or Portuguese foreigners.

Courtesans also form the subject of many shunga. Utamaro was particularly revered for his depictions of courtesans, which offered an unmatched level of sensitivity and psychological nuance. Tokugawa courtesans could be described as the celebrities of their day, and Edo&#x27;s pleasure district, Yoshiwara, is often compared to Hollywood. Men saw them as highly eroticised due to their profession, but at the same time unattainable, since only the wealthiest, most cultured men would have any chance of sexual relations with one. Women saw them as distant, glamorous idols, and the fashions for the whole of Japan were inspired by the fashions of the courtesan. For these reasons, the fetish of the courtesan appealed to many.

Works depicting courtesans have since been criticised for painting an idealised picture of life in the pleasure quarters. It has been argued that they masked the situation of virtual slavery under which sex workers lived. However, Utamaro is just one example of an artist who was sensitive to the inner life of the courtesan, for example showing them wistfully dreaming of escape from Yoshiwara through marriage.

Similarly, boys of the Wakashū age range were considered erotically attractive and often performed the female parts in kabuki productions. Many of them worked as gigolos. These carried the same fetish of the sex worker, with the added quality of often being quite young. They are often depicted with samurai, since wakashū and older samurai often formed couples with the elder acting as a mentor for the younger.

===Stories===

Both painted handscrolls and illustrated erotic books (empon) often presented an unrelated sequence of sexual tableaux, rather than a structured narrative. A whole variety of possibilities are shown—men seduce women, women seduce men; men and women cheat on each other; all ages from virginal teenagers to old married couples; even octopuses were occasionally featured.

While most &quot;shunga&quot; were heterosexual, many depicted male-on-male trysts. Woman-on-woman images were less common but there are extant works depicting this. Masturbation was also depicted. The perception of sexuality differed in Tokugawa Japan from that in the modern Western world, and people were less likely to associate with one particular sexual preference. For this reason the many sexual pairings depicted were a matter of providing as much variety as possible.

The backstory to shunga prints can be found in accompanying text or dialogue in the picture itself, and in props in the background. Symbolism also featured widely, such as the use of plum blossoms to represent virginity or tissues to symbolise impending ejaculation.

=== Clothing ===
In many of the shunga the characters are fully clothed. This is primarily because nudity was not inherently erotic in Tokugawa Japan – people were used to seeing the opposite sex naked in communal baths. It also served an artistic purpose; it helped the reader identify courtesans and foreigners, the prints often contained symbolic meaning, and it drew attention to the parts of the body that were revealed, i.e., the genitalia.

=== Non-realism ===
Shunga couples are often shown in nonrealistic positions with exaggerated genitalia. Explanations for this include increased visibility of the sexually explicit content, artistic interest and psychological impact: that is, the genitalia are interpreted as a &quot;second face&quot;, expressing the primal passions that the everyday face is obligated by &quot;giri&quot; to conceal, and are therefore the same size as the head and placed unnaturally close to it by the awkward positioning.

<text>Virgin is a Polish pop rock band created in 2000 that officially disbanded in 2007. They temporarily reunited in 2014, and permanently in 2016. Its lead singer is Dorota Rabczewska.

==History==

===Virgin (2000–2004)===
Virgin&#x27;s first album &quot;Virgin&quot;, which contained sixteen tracks, had 13,000 sales. . The songs on this album were written by Doda, Andrzej Mogielnicki, Anja Orthodox and Asia Prykowska. After the debut release of this album, Virgin was nominated for a Fryderyk award in the category of &quot;New Face of Music 2002&quot;. The group intensively promoted the album and gave concerts while they were working on their second album. This album showed the group&#x27;s rock side as well as its musical aspirations. It also included a cover of Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Material Girl&quot;. While promoting this album, Doda took part in the reality TV show broadcast on Polsat, titled &quot;Bar&quot;.

===Bimbo (2004–2005)===
The band&#x27;s second album titled &quot;Bimbo&quot; was released in May 2004. The title of this album is American slang for &quot;slut&quot;. Dorota chose this title to caution &quot;All the silly people, who think of me as a whore&quot;. On the new CD, eleven of her compositions can be found. The words for two of the songs, &quot;Bar&quot; and &quot;Ulica&quot;, were written by Anja Orthodox. The singles released from this CD were &quot;Dżaga&quot;, &quot;Kolejny raz&quot; and &quot;Nie zawiedź mnie&quot;. This album also contained a feature on the song &quot;Nie Oceniać Jej&quot; by Arkadiusz &quot;Arekcore&quot; Stępień, who is a Polish guitarist and vocalist from the group &quot;Ametria&quot;.

For &quot;Dżaga&quot;, there were two versions of the video clip (one of them includes uncensored photos where the other does not). One of the main roles in this clip was played by Radosław Majdan, goalkeeper of club Wisła Kraków. The music on &quot;Bimbo&quot; was a continuation of the themes of the first album. 

In 2004, the group parted ways with its bass player Krzysztof Najman, (former husband of Anja Orthodox, vocalist of gothic rock band Closterkeller) and drummer Piotr &quot;Posejdon&quot; Pawłowski. As a result of several months of searching and auditions, the place of Krzysztof Najmana was taken by bass player Łukasz Damm from Wrocław, and Peter Pawłowski was substituted by percussionist Pitr Matsiak from Radom.

===Ficca (2005–2007)===
The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Ficca&quot;, was released on 24 October 2005. It was the first album featuring the new members. The title of this album comes from the Italian word meaning &quot;sheath&quot; . Enclosed with the CD release of this album is an unpublished photo session of the lead musicians of the group.

The first single from this album was &quot;Znak Pokoju&quot;, and it won the &quot;Słowika Publiczności&quot; at the 42. Sopot International Song Festival in 2005, which is voted by the public. This song wades is homage for Pope John Paul II, and deviates from the group&#x27;s previous rock tone to a more melodious pop ballad. The second single from this CD was &quot;2 Bajki&quot;, which was a big hit and successfully stayed in the charts for a long time. The next single was &quot;Szansa&quot;, which was composed specially for the Festival in Opole.

On 23 January 2006, the re-issue of &quot;Ficca&quot; was released, which featured short clips recorded by Doda and her husband from their vacation as well as the music videos to both &quot;Znak pokoju&quot; and &quot;2 bajki&quot;.

At the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole 2006, the group received a &quot;Superjedynka&quot; in category of best pop CD, and also performed the new song &quot;Szansa&quot; in the premiere concert, in which they won the audience vote.

On 14 June, the third edition (second re-issue) of the CD was published in a maxi version. For this edition, the addition included the song &quot;Szansa&quot; and &quot;Nie zawiedź mnie&quot; (live version) as well as karaoke versions of &quot;Znak pokoju&quot; i &quot;Szansa&quot;. A special recording taken during the Opole Festival and another vacation clip is also added to this version of the CD.

On 1 January 2007, on the official website of Virgin, a statement from Tomasz Lubert was released in which he said that he is parting ways with the group. This effectively disbanded the group and Dorota Rabczewska decided to continue her music career as a soloist, releasing her debut album Diamond Bitch in 2007.

=== Virgin Box (2006) ===
In 2006 the previous three albums were released as an individual album titled, Virgin Box. The Virgin Box was a three disc set.

<text>Science North is an interactive science museum in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.

The science centre, which is Northern Ontario&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction, consists of two snowflake-shaped buildings on the southwestern shore of Ramsey Lake, just south of the downtown core, and a former ice hockey arena which includes the complex&#x27;s entrance and an IMAX theatre. The snowflake buildings are connected by a rock tunnel, which passes through a billion-year-old geologic fault. This fault line was not known to be under the complex when the site was originally selected, and was discovered only during the construction of the building in the early 1980s. Where the walkway reaches the larger snowflake, the Vale Cavern auditorium is frequently used for temporary exhibits, press conferences, film screenings, and other gala events by Science North and the wider community.

Inside the main building, a 20-metre fin whale skeleton, recovered from Anticosti Island, hangs from the ceiling.

The science centre is well-known for its team of science communicators, called &#x27;bluecoats&#x27; for their blue lab coat uniforms. Bluecoats provide interpretive and educational experiences for visitors, present shows at the Discovery Theatre, and lead events and tours.

The complex also features a boat tour, the William Ramsey, which offers touring cruises of the scenic Ramsey Lake. Formerly known as the Cortina due to its corporate sponsorship by the city&#x27;s Cortina Pizza restaurant chain, it was renamed the William Ramsey in 2014 in memory of the surveyor for whom the lake was named. The Jim Gordon Boardwalk also extends from the facility to the city&#x27;s Bell Park along the western shore of the lake.

Opened in 1984, the facility was designed by architect Raymond Moriyama of Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects. Local architecture firm Townend, Stefura, Baleshta and Nicholls also contributed to the project. It had its official opening in October 1984, at a ceremony presided over by Queen Elizabeth II during her royal visit.

An agency of the provincial government of Ontario, Science North is overseen by the provincial Ministry of Culture.

==Facilities==

===First level===
* IMAX With Laser - Science North has a 3D IMAX with Laser theatre. The theatre opened in 1994, and was converted to 3D in February 2009.
* Planetarium - In June 2009, Science North added a planetarium. It has an 8-metre dome and 36 seats.
* Vale Cavern - Event Space
* TD Canada Trust Toddler&#x27;s Treehouse - A children&#x27;s educational play area.

===Second level===
* Nature Exchange - Visitors collect and research natural items from the wild and are swapped for points in a database. The points can be used to &quot;purchase&quot; other natural artifacts from around the world (i.e.: Rocks, sea shells, fossils, etc.)
* Lapidary Lab - Moved to Dynamic Earth
* F. Jean MacLeod Butterfly Gallery - A glass-enclosed butterfly house home to more than 400 butterflies from 30 different tropical species.

===Third level===
The exhibits on the third floor are divided into four main areas:
* Northern Forests - This area focuses on animals who live in northern forests. Some of the animals ambassadors for the Northern Forest include Maple the porcupine and Saunders the skunk. Other notable animals include the Northern Flying Squirrels, the Grey Rat Snake and the Big Brown bats. One of the biggest improvements to the third floor include a nocturnal room, allowing people to see active nocturnal animals during the day and better equipment habitats for the animals and for visitors. Also, there is an intricate bee hive, behind a plate glass window, which allows visitors to see into the hive.
* Lakes and Rivers - In this area, animals that live in rivers and lakes are featured. The animals ambassadors on this floor include the Common Snapping Turtle, the Northern Water Snakes and local fish found in Northern Ontario Lakes. This sections allow people to get a better understanding of the aquatics systems that surround Northern Ontario and the difficulties and challenges these systems are currently facing. As well, the stream table (also known as the sand table) shows people what is erosion and how erosion can shape the landscape around us.
* Wetlands - The wetlands area teaches about the complex wetlands ecosystems. With Lilly creek situated right beside Science North, people are able to go on Lilly Creek tours (weather permitting) and get a personal look of what makes wetland such an important landmass for our ecosystems. Some of the animal ambassadors include Northern Ontario frogs (including Green Frogs, Wood Frogs, Tree Frogs and Bullfrogs), American Toads, The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake and the painted turtle. This section also houses the SO2 monitor, which measures the sulphur dioxide levels in Sudbury. There is also an interactive computer that displays the current reading of other sulphur dioxide monitors located throughout the Greater Sudbury region.
* Discovery Theatre - The discovery theatre is located in the centre of the third and fourth levels of Science North. Here, live science shows cover topics ranging from fire to sound. A daily schedule, located in front of the theatre and on the LCD screens around the Science Centre, is kept up to date and people can schedule their day around the shows they want to see. Usually, upbeat music will be played two minutes before the show starts to allow people to know the show is about to begin. Wheelchair accessibly is offered on the first, and third level of the discovery theater.
* The Northern Garden - The Northern Garden is located outside of the science centre. This gives people the opportunity to learn about native plant species in Northern Ontario, plant growth and general garden maintenance.

===Fourth level===
* BodyZone - BodyZone teaches about DNA and how it makes people unique, and how bodies work. There are also many exhibits allowing visitors to measure their performance, such as the race track. The Club Genome object theatre entrance is also in BodyZone.
* Racetrack - Build a race car and run it on two circular track. This area has a K&#x27;Nex table.
* Space Place - This lab focuses on astronomy and space exploration. Exhibits include a gravity well, a microgravity drop tower, exhibits on SNOLAB, and information on Canadian space exploration. The entrance to the &quot;Between the Stars&quot; object theatre is also found in Space Place. This show explores the topic of dark matter - why we know it exists, and how we are trying to detect it. Between the Stars opened in June 2010 and is designed to appeal to all age ranges with a cartoon character named String Man narrating the story of a topic that is quite complex.
* TechLab - Technology and engineering area where visitors can create circuits, take apart old electronics, and play with pulleys and gears.
* DataBase - Computer based technology areas where visitors can learn how we can use computers and coding in our everyday lives.

===Object theatres===
Special film and video exhibits which change over time; current exhibits include
* The Global warming Changing Climate Show -- Narrated by Rick Mercer, the show was updated and reopened in March 2011.
* Between the Stars -- Addresses the evidence for dark matter, what it might be, and how scientists are trying to detect it at SNOLAB.
* Ready, Set, Move! -- Advocates and demonstrates healthy living through an interactive experience.

===Outdoor grounds===
* Polaris Boulevard - is a line which reaches from a large sundial right up the side of the building which points directly at Polaris (the north star).
* Terra - Visited stand on this one-millionth scale world model, outdoors near Science North&#x27;s main entrance. At sunset and sunrise, the Earth&#x27;s shadow moves across Canada. The benchmark at the centre of Terra is: 46° 28&#x27; 12.00&quot; N and 80° 59&#x27; 45.70&quot; W.
* A sculpture honouring local bush plane pilot Rusty Blakey.
* Lily Creek - a marsh located opposite to the centre, Lily Creek is home to many species of creatures.
* The Northern Forest - This outdoor exhibit features many of the tree species grown in northern Ontario that Domtar relies on for its sawmills and for the manufacture of pulp and paper at the Espanola mill.

==Other activities==
Science North, which was opened in 1984, also owns and operates Sudbury&#x27;s Dynamic Earth facility, an earth sciences exhibition which is home to the Big Nickel, one of the city&#x27;s most famous landmarks. From January 22, 2001, to May 10, 2003, the Big Nickel was temporarily located on the primary Science North grounds while Dynamic Earth was under construction.

The Science North Production Team produces object theatres, multi-media presentations and large format film productions for science museums and educational facilities around North America. The team&#x27;s most noted production to date has been the 2023 documentary film &quot;Jane Goodall: Reasons for Hope&quot;, which won several national awards including a special Canadian Screen Award for sustainable production at the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024.

Science North&#x27;s former science director, Alan Nursall, later became a correspondent for the Canadian science newsmagazine series &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, which aired on Discovery Channel and CTV. The institution&#x27;s first science director, David Pearson, returned to the position in 2007. He was succeeded by Jennifer Pink from 2008 to 2017, and Julie Moskalyk from 2017 to 2024.

Science North has also worked extensively with the city&#x27;s Laurentian University on scientific and environmental research and as a partner in the university&#x27;s graduate program in science communication.

Science North runs science education day camps for children in the summer, autumn, and winter.

=== COVID-19 ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Science North engaged in several programs to promote COVID-19 vaccines to youth, families and young adults.

The museum received a $50,000 CAD grant in July 2021 from the Government of Canada for a project titled “Promoting Vaccine Confidence across Northern Ontario.” It was awarded through a grant program called “Encouraging Vaccine Confidence in Canada” jointly administered by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC).

Science North also received a $500,000 grant from the Public Health Agency of Canada&#x27;s Immunization Partnership Fund to target vaccine hesitant individuals through virtual and in-person activities including podcasts, webinars, digital content and events, museum exhibits and workshops.

<text>Jearl Dalton Walker (born 1945 in Pensacola, Florida) is a physicist noted for his book &quot;The Flying Circus of Physics&quot;, first published in 1975; the second edition was published in June 2006. He teaches physics at Cleveland State University.

Walker has also revised and edited the textbook &quot;Fundamentals of Physics&quot; with David Halliday and Robert Resnick.

Walker is a well-known popularizer of physics, and appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Walker is known for his physics demonstrations, which have included sticking his hand in molten lead, walking barefoot over hot coals, lying on a bed of nails, and pouring freezing-cold liquid nitrogen in his mouth to demonstrate various principles of physics. Such demonstrations are included in his PBS series, &quot;Kinetic Karnival&quot;, produced by WVIZ in Cleveland, Ohio.

Walker was born in Pensacola, Florida, and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. He graduated with a degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1973.

Walker authored &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine from 1978 to 1988. During the latter part of this period, he had been the Chairman of the Physics Department at Cleveland State University. He appeared regularly around this time on the long-running CBC radio science program &quot;Quirks and Quarks&quot;.

From 1981 to 1982 he hosted &quot;The Kinetic Karnival of Jearl Walker&quot;, a six-episode series for PBS syndication in the US. In each 30-minute program he performed humorous demonstrations before a live audience. The show was distributed to schools as a teaching aide.

He is the first recipient, in 2005, of the Outstanding Teaching Award from Cleveland State University&#x27;s College of Science. The College&#x27;s Faculty Affairs Committee selected Walker as the first honoree based on his contributions to science education over the last 30 years. The award was thereafter named &quot;The Jearl Walker Outstanding Teaching Award&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="958510" wikidata="Q2486939" url="?curid=958510" title="New York State Route 890">
<text>New York State Route 890 (NY 890) is a freeway located northwest of downtown Schenectady in the Capital District of New York in the United States. Although the route runs north–south, it is signed as east–west to match the posted direction of Interstate 890 (I-890), of which NY 890 is an extension. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Glenville, and its eastern terminus is at an interchange with I-890 in the town of Rotterdam, where NY 890 becomes I-890 and continues east into Downtown Schenectady.

The idea of a Rotterdam–Glenville connector across the Mohawk River was proposed as early as the 1960s. Parts of the right-of-way of NY 890, including the bridges carrying what is now NY 890 over the ramp leading from NY 890 west to NY 5S, were built as part of I-890&#x27;s construction in 1973. Construction of the remainder of the route was delayed for decades due to a lack of funds. Work on the highway finally resumed in 1996, and the length of NY 890 was opened to traffic in October 1998.

==Route description==

NY 890 begins four miles (6 km) from downtown Schenectady at an at-grade intersection with NY 5 in the town of Glenville. The route heads south as a four-lane freeway, passing through a small open area in the otherwise developed town before passing under the Delaware and Hudson Railway. Another brief undeveloped stretch leads to the Mohawk River (Erie Canal), which the highway crosses to reach the town of Rotterdam. On the southern bank, NY 890 encounters the eastern terminus of NY 5S via exit 1A, a modified trumpet interchange built adjacent to a forested area bordering the river.

As the roadway crosses over a ramp leading from NY 890 westbound to NY 5S, it makes a turn to the southeast, bringing the highway closer to the banks of the river. NY 890 also widens to six lanes at this point to accommodate the road&#x27;s upcoming junction with the New York State Thruway. The connection between the Thruway and NY 890 is made via I-890, which begins at Thruway exit 26 and merges with NY 890 at exit 1B, a modified trumpet interchange adjacent to the Thruway junction. NY 890 terminates at the south end of the trumpet interchange, and I-890 continues southeastward on NY 890&#x27;s right-of-way along the Mohawk River toward downtown Schenectady.

==History==

===Origins and cancellation===
Plans for a Mohawk River crossing between New York State Thruway exit 26 west of Schenectady and NY 5 in Glenville date as far back as 1967 when the town of Glenville developed a proposal to build a western bypass of the city of Schenectady. The highway, named &quot;Alternate Route 50&quot; or Route 50W, would run from the Thruway at exit 26, cross the Mohawk River, and ultimately head northeast to a terminus in Saratoga County. The crossing part of the proposal gained traction in 1973 when the final section of I-890 was built to accommodate a northward extension and a future exit with NY 5S near the riverbank. In the meantime, NY 5S was reconfigured to directly connect to the west end of I-890 while Thruway exit 26 was accessed by exiting the highway at modern exit 1B.

Most of the groundwork for the northern extension was put in place around this time. The connection with NY 5S utilized the right-of-way of what was intended to be a ramp for the riverside exit with NY 5S. Graded roadbeds were laid out for both directions of the extension up to the south bank of the Mohawk River, and the ground was graded for all of the proposed exit&#x27;s ramps. A pair of bridges to carry the extension over the westbound ramp to NY 5S were also constructed, but unused at this point. No construction of any kind was present north of the river, even though the state of New York had purchased the road&#x27;s right-of-way. Work on the highway came to a halt in 1976 when the state cancelled the project to shift funds to other projects, including the construction of bridges carrying NY 5 and Freemans Bridge Road over the Mohawk River in downtown Schenectady.

===Revival and construction===
The project idled until 1983 when state voters approved &quot;Rebuild New York&quot;, a $1.25 billion bond issue to improve the state&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. A study of the crossing project began in March 1985 using $800,000 in funds from Rebuild New York and continued through December 1986. The General Contractor was Reicker Construction for the update. L-Tech Coatings, Inc. was the final painting contractor to finish the bridge in December 1986. It was finally completed by March 1988. Even through the preliminary study was complete, the state still lacked the funds needed to construct the road. Projections made in 1986 put the cost of the highway at $20 million. The delay in constructing the highway led to increases in the estimated final price tag, which climbed to $34 million by 1990 and $40 million by 1994.

In 1995, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) finally made plans to construct the highway, now projected to cost $52 million as originally designed. A total of $24.1 million had been set aside for the road by this point—$13.3 million from the federal government and a combined $10.8 million from the state and the New York State Thruway Authority—leading NYSDOT to consider making changes to the road&#x27;s design in an effort to cut the project&#x27;s cost. In 1996, two contracts to construct the Mohawk River bridge and its southern approach were awarded for just $22.5 million. The latter contract, valued at just under $7.5 million, would build ramps and highways on the right-of-ways that had graded and leveled years before, as well as rehabilitate and widen three previously unused bridges, including the two installed along the extension&#x27;s alignment.

Work on the highway began in October 1996, almost 25 years after the completion of I-890 and 40 years since work began on the graded roadbeds on the southern riverbank. Ground was broken on the Mohawk River bridge in May 1997. The highway was completed in October 1998 and opened to traffic at 3 p.m. on October 21, 1998, following a ribbon-cutting ceremony. It was designated as NY 890 at this time, becoming one of several state routes to serve as an extension of a like-numbered Interstate Highway.

<doc id="958511" wikidata="Q1155672" url="?curid=958511" title="Canon EF-S lens mount">
<text>The Canon EF-S lens mount is a derivative of the EF lens mount created for some Canon digital single-lens reflex cameras with APS-C sized image sensors. It was released in 2003. Cameras with the EF-S mount are backward compatible with the EF lenses and, as such, have a flange focal distance of 44.0 mm. Such cameras, however, have more clearance, allowing lens elements to be closer to the sensor than in the EF mount. Only Canon cameras released after 2003 with APS-C sized sensors support the EF-S mount.

The &quot;S&quot; in EF-S has variously been described by Canon as coming from either &quot;Small image circle&quot; (the lens projects a smaller image circle than normal EF lenses to match the sensor), or &quot;Short back focus&quot; (the smaller mirror used in APS-C cameras also allows optical elements to protrude further into the camera body, reducing the minimum distance between the sensor and the back element of the lens). The combination of a smaller sensor and shorter back focal length distance enhances the possibilities for wide angle and very wide angle lenses. Such lenses designed for the EF-S mount can be made smaller, lighter (containing less glass), faster (larger aperture) and less expensive. 

Although not all Canon EF-S lenses use this short back focal length, they cannot be mounted on DSLRs with sensors larger than APS-C. However, some lenses produced by third-party manufacturers may feature the standard EF mount if they do not have the shorter back focal length but only have a small image circle. Such lenses will give noticeable vignetting or unsharp outer areas if used on a 35mm film or full frame sensor cameras. To a lesser degree, vignetting also occurs with APS-H sensor sizes, such as several (now discontinued) cameras of the 1D series.

By design, it is physically impossible to mount EF-S lenses on EF-only cameras. This is because the increased proximity of the lens to the sensor means that on full-frame sensor or 35mm film EF cameras the lens itself would obstruct the mirror&#x27;s movement and cause damage to the lens and/or camera. While it is possible to modify the lens such that the physical obstruction is removed, allowing for mounting to EF mount cameras, the rear of the lens would still obstruct the mirror. An additional reason is that the lenses produce a smaller image circle of even illumination (circle of no vignetting). An EF-S lens alignment mark is indicated by a small white rectangle, whereas the EF employs a small red dot. The lens will insert into the body when the alignment marks on each are matched, and the lens can then be rotated and locked into the operating position. EF-S camera bodies have both EF-S and EF alignment marks, while EF bodies have only EF marks. Some have reported success attaching EF-S lenses to full-frame bodies with the use of an extension tube; however, this does not eliminate the vignetting problem, and also removes the lens&#x27;s ability to achieve infinity focus. Also, attachment of EF-S lenses on EF bodies can often be accomplished by removing the small plastic ring seen in the photo above. Although vignetting is still an issue, photos can be taken, and infinity focus achieved. This modification comes with caveats, one being that on some lenses, like the EF-S 10-22mm, at the 10mm setting, the element protrudes too far back toward EF mount camera bodies. 

The 10D, D60, D30, and earlier cameras share the EF-only mount with the full frame EOS camera bodies, and also with the APS-H size EOS camera bodies (1D series prior to the 1D X), despite having a smaller sensor and therefore a smaller mirror.

==List of EF-S lenses==
The EF-S lens mount is a relatively new offering from Canon, so the selection of available lenses is limited compared to the full EF range, but it is backward compatible with the EF mount, and can therefore still accept all EF lenses. The variety of EF-S prime lenses is very limited in comparison to EF-S zoom lenses, with three primes to nine zooms. EF-S lenses are very popular due to their lower cost and zoom lenses are preferred by amateur photographers. no EF-S lens has been produced with the &quot;L&quot; designation or with diffractive optics, and only three EF-S prime lenses have been produced.

<text>Lindsay Ann Crouse (born May 12, 1948) is an American actress. She made her Broadway debut in the 1972 revival of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and appeared in her first film in 1976 in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. For her role in the 1984 film &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her other films include &quot;Slap Shot&quot; (1977), &quot;Between the Lines&quot; (1977), &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), &quot;Prefontaine&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999). She also had a leading role in the 1987 film &quot;House of Games&quot;, which was directed by her then-husband David Mamet. In 1996, she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for &quot;Between Mother and Daughter&quot;, a &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot; episode. She is also a Grammy Award nominee.

==Early life==
Crouse was born at Le Roy Hospital on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, the daughter of Anna (née Erskine) and Russel Crouse, the playwright and librettist. Her maternal grandparents were author and educator John Erskine and his wife Pauline Ives. Lindsay Ann Crouse&#x27;s full name is an intentional tribute to the Broadway writing partnership of Lindsay and Crouse, which consisted of her father and his writing partner, Howard Lindsay. The two wrote much of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Their 1946 play &quot;State of the Union&quot; won that year&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Their last collaboration was &quot;Mr. President&quot; in 1962. As Crouse has said: &quot;In our family, the work ethic was held up as some kind of byword ... At any hour, somebody&#x27;s typewriter was going.&quot;

==Career==
After graduating from the Chapin School in 1966 
and Radcliffe College in 1970, Crouse began her performing career as a modern and jazz dancer, but she soon switched to acting and made her Broadway debut in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; in 1972. She received her acting training at HB Studio in New York City.

Crouse&#x27;s film career began in 1976, with small roles in television and theatrical movies. In 1977, she appeared as Lily Braden, the discontented wife of hockey player Ned Braden in &quot;Slap Shot&quot;. In 1982 she appeared as the decisive witness in &quot;The Verdict&quot;. Crouse was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the 1984 movie &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;. Among her films was a starring role in &quot;House of Games&quot;, the 1987 film directed and written by her then-husband David Mamet, in which she plays Margaret Ford, a psychiatrist who is intrigued by the art of the con. &quot;It&#x27;s always hard to be directed by someone who&#x27;s close to you,&quot; Crouse says. &quot;Because everybody needs to go home and complain about the director. Everybody.&quot;

Crouse has appeared in featured and guest roles in a number of television series. Notable roles include a recurring portrayal of Kate McBride, a lesbian police officer on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; during its sixth season in 1986. This was the first lesbian recurring character on a major network. Crouse is also known for her role in the fourth season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, where she was a recurring supporting cast member playing Professor Maggie Walsh. Crouse has also guest-starred on &quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Millennium&quot;, and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;.

In recent years, Crouse has concentrated on the theater. &quot;Once you get your driver&#x27;s license, you end your film career,&quot; says Crouse. &quot;Look at my generation. Great actresses like Glenn Close and Susan Sarandon—there&#x27;s nothing written for anyone over a certain age.&quot; In 2007, Crouse opened a revival of &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot;, a one-woman show about the life of poet Emily Dickinson, at the Gloucester Stage in Gloucester, Massachusetts. &quot;You can&#x27;t stop and recite something,&quot; says Crouse. &quot;You have to keep the poetry very, very active, which is pretty easy with Dickinson. She was striving so hard to understand what life was about. It&#x27;s very dramatic poetry in that way.

Crouse appeared in Lee Blessing&#x27;s &quot;Going to St. Ives&quot; with the Gloucester Stage Company during the summer of 2008 and provided the narration for &quot;Virginia Lee Burton: A Sense of Place&quot;, a documentary film about Virginia Lee Burton. In 2021, she appeared in a limited engagement of &quot;Mornings at Seven&quot; at Broadway&#x27;s Theatre at St. Clements.

==Personal life==
After a relationship with Robert Duvall, Crouse married playwright David Mamet in 1977. The two had met during the production on &quot;Slap Shot&quot;. John Lahr writes in his book &quot;Show and Tell: New Yorker Profiles&quot; that when Mamet married Crouse in 1977, he &quot;married into show business aristocracy&quot;. Lahr also writes that Mamet received his first screenwriting assignment through Crouse. Crouse was on her way to audition for Bob Rafelson&#x27;s 1981 remake of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, and jokingly Mamet told Crouse to tell Rafelson that &quot;he was a fool if he didn&#x27;t hire me to write the screenplay.&quot; But Crouse said this to Rafelson, who called Mamet; when the director asked why he should hire him for the screenplay, Mamet replied, &quot;Because I&#x27;ll give you a good screenplay or a sincere apology.&quot; Mamet received the job. She and Mamet divorced in 1990. Their marriage produced two daughters, Willa and Zosia Mamet.

Crouse&#x27;s brother is Timothy Crouse, author of &quot;The Boys on the Bus&quot; about political journalism during the 1972 presidential campaign.

===Buddhist beliefs===

Crouse is a Buddhist. In 2005, she organized an annual Buddhist educational program, originally held at the Windhover Center for the Performing Arts in Rockport, Massachusetts, and then in 2010 moved to The Governor&#x27;s Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts. Crouse has spoken on the relevance of Buddhism in the modern world:

<text>Alan Dupree Wheat (born October 16, 1951) is an American economist, lobbyist, and politician who served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from the state of Missouri from 1983 to 1995.

==Early life==

His father was James Wheat, an officer and civil engineer in the U.S. Air Force. His mother Emogene (Jean) Wheat was a teacher. Since his father served in the USAF, he grew up in air bases and went to schools in Wichita, Kansas, and Seville in Spain. In 1968, he graduated from Airline High School in Bossier City, Louisiana. Wheat was hired by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as an economist in 1972 after passing his B.A. in economics at Grinnell College, in Iowa. Between 1973 and 1975 he joined the Mid–America Regional Council in Kansas City for the same role. In 1975 he then became an aide to Mike White a Jackson County, Missouri, executive.

=== Missouri legislature ===
In 1976, he won the election at age 25 to the Missouri general assembly, at the age of 25 and stayed there until 1982.

=== Campaign for Congress ===
When Congressman Richard Bolling retired at the 1982 House of Representatives election, Wheat won the Democratic primary by only 1,004 votes (11%). He went on to win the general election to succeed Bolling by beating Republican John Sharp with 58% of the votes.

==House career and Senate campaign==

Wheat was the youngest member of the United States House of Representatives ever to be appointed to the Rules Committee, and was also the first African-American to represent a district with a non-liberal white majority. He was also a member of the United States House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families.

In 1992, Wheat drew four opponents in the Democratic primary election. He was perceived to be vulnerable due to the House banking scandal and his having been one of the House members who had made overdrafts. Wheat survived the primary and defeated Republican Edward “Gomer” Moody, who was a well-known Missouri businessman. Wheat won the general election, which also included two third-party candidates, with 59% of the vote.

After United States Senator John Danforth said he would not run for re-election in the 1994 election, Wheat chose to leave the House and instead run for Danforth&#x27;s seat. The Senate race was closely watched nationally because Wheat was perceived as a candidate who could win crossover votes, as the House district he represented was 70 percent white. Wheat lost the general election to former governor John Ashcroft. Karen McCarthy was elected to succeed him in the House.

==Post-congressional career==

After his Senate race, Wheat was chosen as vice president of Public Policy and Government Relations at CARE. He served as deputy campaign manager and director of constituent outreach of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1996. In 1997, Wheat formed the lobbying group Wheat Government Relations.

Wheat joined the national law firm and lobbying practice Polsinelli in 2013, as the firm&#x27;s Public Policy practice chair.

In 2021, Wheat helped found Wheat Shroyer Government Relations, a public service-oriented lobbying firm, where he currently serves as Chairman.

Wheat currently serves on the board of directors at CARE.

== Personal life ==
Wheat has three children.

<text>Campbellford is an unincorporated place and former town in Northumberland County, Ontario, Canada, in the township municipality of Trent Hills. It lies approximately midway between Toronto and Ottawa. It is situated on both the Trent-Severn Waterway and the Trans Canada Trail. It can be reached from Highway 401 by exiting at Brighton (exit 509) and going north on County Road 30. It can also be reached from Highway 7 at the Havelock exit going south (also on County Road 30). Campbellford is surrounded by prime agricultural land which is home to many farms. In recent years, some of the town&#x27;s agricultural sector has diversified into non-traditional areas such as bison farming, rare breeds farming and there are many horse farms in the area. The town has a farmers market that is open two days a week in the summer.

== History ==
Campbellford traces its history back to 1834 when the first homesteaders arrived in the area. Once very wealthy, it is still known today for its many fine Victorian homes. Campbellford became a town in 1906 (Trent Hills Visitor Guide, 2009, p. 13). About 70 years earlier, &quot;the British government gave two brothers, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Campbell and Major David Campbell, 1800 acres of land to settle in an area named for the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s wife Lady Elizabeth Seymour&quot; (Trent Hills Visitors Guide, 2009, p. 13). The Trent River (long before it became a canal) meandered through the Campbell property and, not far from the current town centre, the river was shallow enough for crossing. The river crossing came to be known as &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Ford.&quot; In 1876 the Village of Campbellford was created and then became a town in 1906. Its centennial was celebrated in 2006. In 2001, Campbellford, Hastings and Warkworth amalgamated to form the Municipality of Trent Hills.

==Local information==
Campbellford Memorial Hospital is the largest employer in the community, and the only hospital located between Belleville and Peterborough. It is a teaching practice affiliated with the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine.

In the summer, Campbellford&#x27;s population swells with tourists taking advantage of the local lakes and waterways, trails, and camping areas. In the winter, snowmobiling is a popular attraction. Ferris Provincial Park is located on the Trent River a short distance south of Campbellford.

Campbellford is a stop on the Trent-Severn Waterway, an important inland water transportation network, and is situated between the Ranney Falls Flight Lock (Locks 11 and 12) and the Campbellford Lock (13) of this system.

Campbellford is home to the radio station CKOL-FM.

The town has a high statue of a toonie, which was designed by local artist Brent Townsend.

==Notable residents==
* Escott Reid (1905–1999), Canadian diplomat and Order of Canada recipient
* W. F. Taylor (1877–1945), founding president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association

<text>John Joseph DeGioia (born 1957) is an American academic administrator and philosopher who served as the president of Georgetown University from 2001 to 2024. He was the first lay president of the school and its longest-serving president. Upon his appointment, he also became the first lay president of any Jesuit university in the United States. Having spent his entire career at Georgetown, where he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees, DeGioia was the dean of student affairs and held various vice presidential positions before becoming president.

== Early life and education ==

John Joseph DeGioia was born in Connecticut in 1957, and was raised in Orange, Connecticut, and Hanford, California. He attended Amity Regional High School in Woodbridge, Connecticut, graduating in 1975. He then attended Georgetown College at Georgetown University, where he majored in English. DeGioia also played sports and founded the Georgetown chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1979.

== Georgetown University administrator ==

===Dean and vice president===
Upon graduation, DeGioia became a hall director at one of Georgetown&#x27;s freshman dormitories, New South Hall. In 1982, he became an assistant to university president Timothy S. Healy, where he oversaw the office of the president. Three years later he was named dean of student affairs, during which time he led the university&#x27;s committee on free speech, expanded the university&#x27;s psychological and counseling services, and implemented a program to track the performance of student athletes. He also participated in two fundraising campaigns, one of which raised money for the construction of the Leavey Center. As dean of student affairs, he also was involved in the conflicts over Georgetown&#x27;s Catholic identity during the tenure of Healy&#x27;s successor, Leo J. O&#x27;Donovan. DeGioia was criticized by some Catholics for allowing the formation of a student abortion rights group in 1991. The funding for the group was later revoked due to three events that DeGioia claimed advocated for abortion, violating the terms he had set out for the club.

O&#x27;Donovan named DeGioia the associate vice president and chief administrative officer of Georgetown&#x27;s main campus in 1992. DeGioia received his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy from the university&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1995. He has taught undergraduates at the university as a professor of philosophy since that time.

That same year, DeGioia was promoted to vice president, overseeing all operations of the main campus, including the university&#x27;s finances, undergraduate admissions, financial aid, athletics, and student affairs. He was promoted to senior vice president in 1998, where he was responsible for all university-wide operations. In this capacity, he managed the Georgetown Medical Center&#x27;s financial and academic strategy, and ultimately negotiated the sale of the Georgetown University Hospital to MedStar Health in 2000, while retaining university ownership of the School of Medicine.

=== University president ===

On July 1, 2001, DeGioia became the president of Georgetown University. Succeeding O&#x27;Donovan, upon his appointment, DeGioia became the first lay president of any Jesuit university in the United States. It was the board of directors&#x27; initial intention to hire a Jesuit for the job, but they determined that there was not a suitable candidate for the office. In his inauguration speech on October 14, DeGioia expressed his commitment to carrying on the Jesuit tradition of the university. Upon assuming office, he oversaw the successful completion of a $1 billion fundraising campaign (equivalent to $ in ), which the board of directors had begun in 1995. DeGioia began another major fundraising campaign in 2011, which reached its goal of $1.5 billion in 2015 (equivalent to $ in ), one year ahead of schedule.

A number of construction projects were undertaken during DeGioia&#x27;s presidency. He assumed office midway through the construction of the Southwest Quadrangle, and oversaw its completion. Additionally, a new, science building, Regents Hall, opened in 2012, and the John R. Thompson, Jr. Intercollegiate Athletic Center opened in 2016.

Several new academic components were created during his tenure. The largest of these were the Georgetown campus in Qatar, which opened in 2005, and the McCourt School of Public Policy, which was founded in 2013. Permanent programs also were established in Shanghai and London.

DeGioia was involved in several controversies as president. In 2012, he publicly came to the defense of a student at the Georgetown University Law Center, Sandra Fluke, following her testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives in support of the Affordable Care Act&#x27;s contraceptive mandate, when political pundit Rush Limbaugh made disparaging comments about her. That same year, DeGioia was criticized by prominent Catholics, including the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, for Georgetown&#x27;s invitation of Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and author of the contraceptive mandate, to be honored as a graduation speaker. This prompted William Peter Blatty, a Georgetown alumnus, to file a canon lawsuit with the Vatican, requesting that it order the university to comply with &quot;Ex corde Ecclesiae&quot;. 

In 2016, DeGioia convened a systemic study of and apology for the university&#x27;s 19th-century connection to slavery.

DeGioia became the longest-serving president in Georgetown&#x27;s history in 2014. On June 5, 2024, he suffered a stroke and was in stable condition after prompt medical intervention. On November 21, 2024, DeGioia announced that he would resign as president to focus on his recovery. He will hold the title of president emeritus and will remain a member of the faculty.

== Honors and affiliations ==
In addition to his role as university president, DeGioia is involved in a number of national education organizations. He has been the chair of the board of directors of the American Council on Education and the Forum for the Future of Higher Education, and the chair of the board of governors of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). He has been a member of the boards of directors of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the National Association of Independent Schools, as well as a commissioner of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. He is a member of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Agenda Council on Values and WEF&#x27;s Global University Leaders Forum.

DeGioia was presented the &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award for Excellence in Academia&quot; by the Order Sons of Italy in America in 2004, and the &quot;Catholic in the Public Square Award&quot; by &quot;Commonweal&quot; magazine in 2012. He was named &quot;Washingtonian of the Year&quot; by &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine in 2008, and a &quot;Brave Thinker&quot; by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2012.

DeGioia was inducted into the Amity Regional High School hall of honor in 2006. In 2010, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has received honorary degrees from Miami Dade College in 2008, Loyola University Maryland in 2009, Queens University Belfast in 2009, Sacred Heart University in 2011, Mount Aloysius College in 2015, and Seattle University in 2016. In addition, he has received an honorary fellowship at Wrexham Glyndŵr University in 2010, and the &quot;Esteemed Friend&quot; award from Sophia University in Tokyo in 2014. He has been a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO.

== Personal life ==
DeGioia&#x27;s father, John G. DeGioia, worked as a customer service specialist for a Connecticut manufacturing company. His mother taught gifted students in the Hanford, California, public schools.

On November 5, 1994, DeGioia married Theresa Anne Miller, a 1989 graduate of Georgetown University. Both Catholic, they were married at Holy Trinity Church in the Georgetown neighborhood, in a ceremony presided over by DeGioia&#x27;s uncle and Jesuit priest, John J. Begley. They have one son. DeGioia is a member of the Order of Malta.

<text>Dynamic Earth is an interactive earth sciences museum in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Owned-and-operated by Science North, Dynamic Earth builds on the city&#x27;s mining heritage, focusing principally on geology and mining history exhibitions.

The centre, which opened in 2003, is home to the Big Nickel, one of the city&#x27;s most famous landmarks.

Dynamic Earth offers tours of the mine. The tour starts with a seven-story elevator ride descending to a cavern. Then the tour goes through a demonstration mine to showcase the evolution of mining from turn-of-the-century to modern day. The mine&#x27;s temperature are averages at 13°C (55°F) all year long. The final destination is Epiroc Theatre, where educational films are played, with a focus on nature documentaries, Sudbury history, and mining.

The science park has activities such as interactive historical mining equipment, interior playground, and gold sifting. During the winter, Sudbury Snow trails are managed by Dynamic Earth Science North working with northern communities to offer a &quot;Northern Nature Trading experience&quot; where visitors can trade and build collections of natural objects. In 2013, Science North had 44,000 student visits and almost 47,000 participants in science programs and workshops.

==Affiliations==
The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network and the Virtual Museum of Canada. The building was used to gather data for FLAC and Numerical Modeling in Geomechanics which is responsible for modeling the Greater Sudbury Area.

This project was combined into two phases, Research and construction, Significant financial contributions included: C$463,000: Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation, C$499,000: Independent Electricity System Operator&#x27;s Conservation Fund, C$620,000: Electrale Innovation and MIRARCO – Mining Innovation.

<text>A legendary saga or fornaldarsaga (literally, &quot;story/history of the ancient era&quot;) is a Norse saga that, unlike the Icelanders&#x27; sagas, takes place before the settlement of Iceland. There are some exceptions, such as &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot;, which takes place in the 11th century. The sagas were probably all written in Iceland, from about the middle of the 13th century to about 1400, although it is possible that some may be of a later date, such as &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;.

==Description of the sagas==
In terms of form, &quot;fornaldarsögur&quot; are similar to various other saga-genres, but tend towards fairly linear, episodic narratives. Like sagas in other genres, many quote verse, but in the &quot;fornaldarsögur&quot; that verse is almost invariably in the metre of Eddaic verse (unlike the skaldic verse found in most other saga genres). The setting is primarily Scandinavia in the time prior to the settlement of Iceland and the conversion of Scandinavia, but occasionally it moves temporarily to more distant and exotic locations or has its characters encounter Christian cultures (one example of both being &quot;Örvar-Odds saga&quot;). There are also very often mythological elements, such as dwarves, elves, giants and magic. In centuries past, they were considered to be reliable historic sources by Scandinavian scholars, but since the 19th century, they have been considered to contain very little historic material. The present consensus is that, although some of the sagas contain a small core which is not fiction, or are based on historical characters, the primary function of the legendary sagas was entertainment, and the aim of the sagas has not been to present a historically accurate tale. Recently, however, it has been emphasized that the sagas are useful sources for the culture of 13th and 14th century Iceland, &quot;in terms of the light that they can shed on the culture in which they were composed&quot; i.e. Iceland in the later Middle Ages. In the words of Margaret Clunies Ross,
:The themes, characters and the whole world of the &quot;fornaldarsaga&quot; lend themselves to interpretation, not as realistic narratives, but rather as subjects dealing with deep and disturbing issues that cannot be approached from the perspective of the mundane world but must rather be enacted in a literary world in which often taboo subjects can be raised and aired, though not necessarily resolved. They may also be treated in a comic or parodic vein.

Some of the sagas are based on distant historic characters, and this is evident in cases where there are corroborating sources, such as &quot;Ragnars saga loðbrókar&quot;, &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot; and &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. In the case of &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, it conveys names of historical places in present Ukraine during the period c. 150-450, and the last part of the saga is used as a historic source for Swedish history. Indeed, they often contain very old Germanic matter, such as the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; which contains poetry about Sigurd that did not find its way into the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and which would otherwise have been lost (see the Great Lacuna). Other sagas deal with heroes such as Ragnar Lodbrok, Hrólf Kraki and Orvar-Odd. In these respects, then, the &quot;fornaldarsögur&quot; overlap in genre and occasionally content with the Kings&#x27; sagas.

The Fornaldarsagas have great value for legend research, since they contain motifs and complexes of motifs from many types of legend of which there is otherwise no documentation in Scandinavia prior to the mid-19th century. They are also of great value for scholars studying medieval Scandinavian ballads, particularly the Faroese kvæði, which are often based on the same matters. Moreover, they are also very important for the study of Scandinavian and Germanic heroic legends together with Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; which was based on the same heroic poetry and traditions.

Philologists have generally held the legendary sagas in less esteem, in terms of their literary value, than the Icelanders&#x27; sagas. The content is often less realistic, the characters more two-dimensional, and the sagas often borrow themes from each other, and from folk tales. In these aspects of style and reception, the &quot;fornaldarsögur&quot; tend to overlap with the Chivalric sagas, particularly those composed in medieval Iceland.

The legendary sagas have influenced later writers, for instance the Swede Esaias Tegnér, who wrote &quot;Frithiof&#x27;s saga&quot;, based on the &quot;Friðþjófs saga ins frœkna&quot;. One such saga was even forged in the early modern period: &quot;Hjalmars och Hramers saga&quot;.

<doc id="958534" wikidata="Q847238" url="?curid=958534" title="European Engineer">
<text>European Engineer (EUR ING) is an international professional qualification and title for highly qualified engineers used in over 32 European countries. Contemporary EUR ING engineers are degree-qualified and have gained the highest level of professional competencies through training and monitored professional practice experience. EUR ING engineers are characterised by their ability to develop appropriate solutions to engineering problems, using new or existing technologies, through innovation, research, creativity and change. They might develop and apply new technologies, promote advanced designs and design methods, introduce new and more efficient production techniques, marketing and construction concepts, pioneer new engineering services and management methods.

The title is pre-nominal, i.e. it is placed before, rather than after, the name as in the case of a post-nominal title such as that for academic degrees (however, in some European countries, academic degrees are also pre-nominal). It is displayed in uppercase with no punctuation (EUR ING).

== Qualification ==
The title is granted after successful application to a national member of Engineers Europe which includes representation from many European countries, including much of the European Union. 
In providing an acceptable common and highly professional standard, the European Engineer requires proven experience and competency in the application of scientific knowledge, level of professional skill, safety and environmental consciousness, sense of responsibility and the ability to communicate within the level of supervision received and given. A substantial number of years of formation and practice, consisting of an accredited engineering degree, further advanced training, and extensive responsible professional experience, is required by Engineers Europe for the EUR ING title. This is defined in the EUR ING standard for
professional engineering competence (EUR ING Spec).

Recognition of the qualification and title are generally not specifically incorporated into national law. In all cases approval is only after peer review by the appropriate national engineering society. The EU Directive 89/48/EEC generally exempts a bearer from additional examination in the European Union. Names are also placed on the EUR ING Register maintained by Engineers Europe in addition to national member registers.

== Ireland and the UK ==
In Ireland and the United Kingdom, the Chartered Engineer title (8-12 year qualification process) is a prerequisite requirement for an application for the EUR ING title. In the United Kingdom the Privy Council has approved the use of the title, which can be displayed on a British passport.

== France ==
In France, it is the association Engineers and Scientists of France (IESF) which manages the applications for the attribution of the title of European Engineer (EUR ING) with Engineers Europe. A Masters level engineering degree recognised by the state (Bac+5), together with a minimum of five years of experience and training is required for the application of the EUR ING title to Engineers Europe.

== Germany ==
In Germany for the application of EUR ING, a Bachelors and master&#x27;s degree in engineering is required along with the relevant training and experience consisting of the seven years formation required by Engineers Europe. Qualified engineers must also be a member of an engineering association such as VDI, VDE or another member of German Association of Technical and Academic Societies (DVT), the technical and scientific association representing professional engineering in Germany.

== Belgium ==
In Belgium a Master of Engineering degree together with further years of postgraduate experience and training is required for the application of the EUR ING title. This is achieved through the Committee of Belgian Engineers (Comité des Ingénieurs Belges, CIBIC).

== Greece ==
In Greece a Master of Science in Engineering (5-year course leading to a Diploma/Dipl.Ing) from a university together with at least two further years of postgraduate experience and training in relevant roles as an Engineer is required for the application of the EUR ING title. This is achieved through the Technical Chamber of Greece (Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος, ΤΕΕ) after an application and examination of all required specifications.

Engineers Europe also requests that the School of Engineering be accredited by a EUR-ACE Seal of Excellence. In the French-speaking part of Belgium (Wallonia) it is the responsibility of AEQES, the agency for the Evaluation of the Quality of Higher Education of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation (also known as the &quot;French Community of Belgium&quot;) to request and obtain this European reference certification.

<doc id="958539" wikidata="Q4342987" url="?curid=958539" title="Time Chasers">
<text>Time Chasers (originally released as Tangents) is a 1994 science fiction film directed by David Giancola and starring Matthew Bruch, George Woodard, and Bonnie Pritchard. The film premiered in Rutland, Vermont on March 16, 1994 to three invitation-only showings, and in open release in Rutland theatres the next day. The film follows the adventures of an amateur inventor who goes through time with his female accomplice to stop an evil megacorporation intent on changing history for profit. The film was lampooned on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in 1997, and by Rifftrax in a live event broadcast on May 5, 2016.

==Plot==
Physics teacher and amateur pilot Nick Miller (Matthew Bruch) has finally completed his quest of enabling time travel, via a Commodore 64 and his small airplane. After being inspired by a television commercial for GenCorp, he uses a ruse to bring out both a GenCorp executive and a reporter from a local paper. To Nick&#x27;s surprise, the reporter is Lisa Hansen (Bonnie Pritchard), an old high school flame. One trip to 2041 later and Gencorp&#x27;s executive, Matthew Paul (Peter Harrington), quickly arranges Nick a meeting with CEO J.K. Robertson (George Woodard). Impressed by the potential of time travel, Robertson offers Nick a licensing agreement on the technology.

The following week, Nick and Lisa meet at the supermarket and go on a date to the 1950s. However, another trip to 2041 reveals that GenCorp abused Nick&#x27;s time travel technology, creating a dystopian future. In an attempt to tell J.K. about how GenCorp inadvertently ruined the future. J.K. dismisses the eventuality, and states that there&#x27;s enough time to worry about how to fix it before it happens. J.K. sees Nick as a threat to GenCorp, and due to the association with the U.S. Government, considers Nick&#x27;s actions as treason. Nick and Lisa escape GenCorp and spend the remainder of the film trying to reverse the damage to the future. When J.K. finds out about this, he and Matt try to shoot down Nick&#x27;s plane, killing Lisa in the process while Nick jumps out before the plane crashes. This ultimately culminates in a fight in 1777 during the American Revolution, the deaths of the present Nick and Robertson, and the destruction of the time machine before the original demo, thus ensuring that the majority of the film&#x27;s events never happen in the first place. The film ends with the now current Nick (now aware of the danger of his time machine) sabotaging his demonstration, and doing a pitch of how an elderly skydiver would be a better ad campaign for J.K.&#x27;s company. Furious about being misled, J.K. fires Matt. Nick deletes the data that makes time travel possible. At the end of the film, Nick talks to Lisa in the supermarket as he did in the previous timeline.

==Cast==

* Matthew Bruch as Nick Miller
* Bonnie Pritchard as Lisa Henson
* Peter Harrington as Matthew Paul
* George Woodard as J.K. Robertson
* Jason Smiley as Future Inhabitant
* Cyrus Rodgers as Future Inhabitant
== Production ==

&quot;Time Chasers&quot; was written and directed by David Giancola, under the title &quot;Tangents&quot;. It was promoted as the first feature film directed, written, and produced in Vermont.

The production was shot in the Rutland, Vermont area during the summer of 1990, though it has a distinctive assortment of mid-1980s cultural artifacts, sets, and props. It was made on a $150,000 budget by 24 year old director David Giancola and his company Edgewood Studios.

Scenes of the dystopic future were filmed at the Howe Center which Giancola&#x27;s family was then renovating. A few scenes were shot in the Burlington area; the undisturbed future were shot by the Papa Gino&#x27;s in what was then the Burlington Square Mall and the 1950s diner was Libby&#x27;s Blue Line Diner (now Athens Diner) by I-89 Exit 16.

In 2004, when asked if he was considering a sequel, Giancola said: &quot;We don&#x27;t have any plans for a sequel, there have been so many time travel films since covering the same material, I don&#x27;t feel I have anything new to add.&quot;

==Release==
To make the title of the movie more comprehensible in the Asian markets, the title of the movie was changed to &quot;Time Chasers,&quot; from &quot;Tangents&quot;.

In 2008, a new &quot;Special Anniversary Edition&quot; of the film was released with deleted scenes, new audio commentary and in depth humorous interviews, including &quot;Memories In Time&quot; by filmmaker Andrew Gannon.

===Reception===
In 1994, &quot;Time Chasers&quot; won the first-place Gold Award in the independent category at the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==
The film initially lost money, but licensing fees for its 1997 &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; appearance took its earnings out of the red. For the showing on &quot;MST3K&quot;, the cast and crew had a reunion party to view the lampooning. &quot;MST3K&quot; star Michael J. Nelson claims that some at the party were not happy at the mocking, in particular Peter Harrington. However, director Giancola said they all &quot;laughed their asses off&quot;, but also admitted that some people at the time &quot;took it a bit too seriously.&quot; Harrington was originally planned to appear in the episode as a guest but was unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts.

<text>Melvin Reynolds (born January 8, 1952) is an American politician from Illinois. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995. He resigned in October 1995 after a jury convicted him of sexual assault charges related to sex with an underage campaign worker.

==Early life==
Reynolds and his twin brother, Marvin Jerry Reynolds, were born in Mound Bayou, Mississippi to Reverend J. J. Reynolds and Essie Mae Prather. Reynolds moved to Chicago as a child. He received an Associate of Arts from one of the City Colleges of Chicago, and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and from Harvard University with a M.P.A. He also won a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he attended Lincoln College and received an LL.B.

Before entering politics, Reynolds worked as an assistant professor of political science at Roosevelt University in Chicago, Illinois. He also founded the Community Economic Development and Education Foundation.

==Political career==
Reynolds ran three times from 1988 to 1992 in Democratic Party elections for the 2nd District against incumbent Gus Savage, who was known for racially incendiary and anti-Semitic remarks that drew criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. In 1988, Reynolds finished third with only 14% of the vote with multiple candidates running. In 1990, Reynolds lost, but ran much closer after Savage&#x27;s conduct was criticized by the House Ethics Committee in connection with a sex scandal.

In 1992, redistricting pushed the 2nd further into Chicago&#x27;s suburbs. The New York Times reported that this change was &quot;seen as a benefit to the 40-year-old Mr. Reynolds, whose appeals for accountability and racial unity sit well with middle-class black moderates embarrassed by Mr. Savage and whites frightened by his often combative, racially charged speech.&quot; Shortly before the primary, Reynolds was lightly injured when unknown gunmen fired shotguns at his vehicle while he was waiting at an intersection. 
He was given police protection for the rest of the campaign; Savage&#x27;s supporters accused Reynolds of staging the incident to generate sympathy for himself and suspicion of Savage. Reynolds did not directly accuse Savage of organizing the attack.

Days later, Reynolds beat Savage in the Democratic primary on March 17, and easily won the general election in November. In Congress, he was granted a seat on the Ways and Means Committee, the first freshman to serve on this committee in 14 years. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement and introduced legislation on gun control.

==Convictions and resignation==
In August 1994, Reynolds was indicted for sexual assault and criminal sexual abuse for engaging in a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer that began during the 1992 campaign. He also faced charges of child pornography for asking the underage campaign worker to obtain &quot;lewd photographs of another girl who was age 15&quot; and obstruction of justice for convincing one of the girls involved to lie to authorities. Despite the charges, he continued his campaign and was re-elected in November without opposition. Reynolds initially denied the charges, which he claimed were racially motivated.

On August 22, 1995, Reynolds was convicted on 12 counts of criminal sexual assault, sexual abuse, obstruction of justice, and solicitation of child pornography. He resigned his seat on October 1 of that year. Had he attempted to stay in office, his role in Congress would have been very limited, as longstanding House rules state that a member convicted of a felony should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the House Ethics Committee reviews the matter. Reynolds was sentenced to five years in federal prison and was expected to be released in 1998.

==Bank fraud==
In April 1997, Reynolds was convicted on 16 new counts of bank fraud, misusing campaign funds for personal use, and lying to FEC investigators. Specifically, one count of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud, eight counts of making false statements on loan applications, one count of conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission, and four counts of making false statements to the FEC.

These charges resulted in an additional sentence of 78 months in federal prison, to run consecutively with his 1995 sentence. Reynolds served all of his first sentence, and served 42 months in prison for the later charges. President Bill Clinton then commuted his sentence for bank fraud and Reynolds was released from prison. He served the remaining time in a halfway house.

==Later career==
In January 2001, Reynolds was hired by Jesse Jackson&#x27;s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition to decrease the number of young African-Americans going to prison.

In 2004, Reynolds sought to win back his old House seat, but was overwhelmingly defeated in the Democratic primary by the man who had succeeded him, Jesse Jackson, Jr., with Jackson netting 88% of the vote. Reynolds sought the seat again, running in the 2013 special election to replace Jackson after Jackson retired. He came in 7th place in the Democratic primary.

==Later legal troubles==
On February 18, 2014, Reynolds was arrested in Zimbabwe for overstaying his visa. He was allegedly found to be in possession of pornographic videos he had filmed with several women at the hotel where he was staying. Possession of pornography is a crime in the country. He had also purportedly accrued over $24,000 in hotel charges that he had yet to pay. The pornography charges were later dropped, but he pleaded guilty to violating immigration laws, and was deported to South Africa. He claimed in early March 2014 to be hiding there from Zimbabwean death squads, who he claimed were targeting him because he possessed information about American companies from Chicago doing business illegally in Zimbabwe.

On June 26, 2015, Reynolds was indicted by a grand jury for failure to file federal income tax returns for the 2009 through 2012 tax years on more than $400,000 income. The next month he missed his arraignment, because he claimed he could not return to the U.S. due to issues with his daughter&#x27;s health. It was not clear where Reynolds was, although he had previously hidden in South Africa out of fear for his life.

In April 2016, Reynolds was sentenced to two months of prison for two bond violations in his tax case and his trial was scheduled for September; Reynolds decided to represent himself in court. Reynolds claims the majority of the income the government claimed should be filed on income tax returns was given by Elzie Higginbottom, the key witness for the trial on misdemeanor tax charges, to him in order to travel to South Africa to set up opportunities in real estate and the diamond industry.

On September 28, 2017, Judge Robert Gettleman found Reynolds guilty on tax charges, on all four counts alleging he failed to file a federal income tax return for four consecutive years. He was sentenced by Gettleman to six months in prison on May 10, 2018, which he began serving at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago on August 1. At a press conference after the sentencing, Reynolds stated he planned to move to South Africa with his daughter after his release.

Released into a halfway house in November 2018, Reynolds filed a lawsuit against deposed Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe and a Chicago-area businessman for what he said was &quot;physical and psychological torture&quot; that took place during his 2014 detainment in Zimbabwe. Reynolds received permission from the U.S. court to travel to Africa while on supervised release. But as of August 2019, he was still living in the Chicago area.

<doc id="958556" wikidata="Q921536" url="?curid=958556" title="Viking Press">
<text>Viking Press (formally Viking Penguin, also listed as Viking Books) is an American publishing company owned by Penguin Random House. It was founded in New York City on March 1, 1925, by Harold K. Guinzburg and George S. Oppenheimer and then acquired by the Penguin Group in 1975.

==Imprints==
* Viking Kestrel
* Viking Adult, who got in legal trouble in 1946 due to John Steinbeck&#x27;s bold eulogy, and fell out of public favor in 1947
* Viking children&#x27;s Books
* Viking Portable Library
* Pamela Dorman Books

===Viking Children&#x27;s===

In 1933, Viking Press founded a department called Junior Books to publish children&#x27;s books. The first book published was &quot;The Story About Ping&quot; in 1933 under editor May Massee. Junior Books was later renamed Viking Children&#x27;s Books. Viking Kestrel was one of its imprints. 

Its books have won the Newbery and Caldecott Medals, and include such books as &quot;The Twenty-One Balloons&quot;, written and illustrated by William Pene du Bois (1947, Newbery medal winner for 1948), &quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot;, &quot;The Stinky Cheese Man&quot; by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith (1993), &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;, and &quot;The Story of Ferdinand&quot;. Its paperbacks are now published by Puffin Books, which includes the Speak and Firebird imprints. In 2023, Tamar Brazis was named v-p and publisher of Viking Children&#x27;s Books.

===Viking Critical Library===

The Viking Critical Library offers academic editions of literary texts. Like W. W. Norton&#x27;s &quot;Norton Critical Editions&quot;, all titles print the text alongside a selection of critical essays and contextual documents (including relevant extracts from the author&#x27;s oeuvre). The series, which only saw sporadic publications in the late &#x27;70s and late &#x27;90s, has been dormant since 1998, with no new titles released since then. However, a number of existing titles remain in print.

<doc id="958558" wikidata="Q2065060" url="?curid=958558" title="Oceanic (unfinished ship)">
<text>Oceanic was the planned name of an unfinished ocean liner that was partially built by Harland and Wolff for the White Star Line. It would have been the third ship bearing the name &quot;Oceanic&quot;, after the one of 1870 and the one of 1899. It was envisaged in 1926, with the idea of modernizing the transatlantic service of the company. With the arrival of Lord Kylsant at the head of the company, the planned size of the project increased, until it became that of a large ship destined to be the first to exceed the symbolic limit of in length and in speed.

After several years of study, the construction began in June 1928 in the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyards in Belfast. However, the work was carried out at a slow pace and ceased in June 1929, probably because further studies relating to the propulsion were needed. The Great Depression which began the same year and the financial affair which sent Lord Kylsant to prison in 1931 put a definitive end to the construction, for which the government refused to advance funds.

Within the White Star Line fleet, the planned &quot;Oceanic&quot; was replaced by two smaller ships, and .

==Birth of the project==

By the early 1910s, the White Star Line had planned to provide regular and cost-effective transatlantic service with its three ships. The loss of in 1912, then of in 1916, however, seriously handicapped this aim. Following World War I, the company was given two German liners in compensation for wartime damage, which became and . Both were assigned to the transatlantic service alongside , the only surviving ship of the initially planned trio. It quickly turned out, however, that while &quot;Majestic&quot; and &quot;Olympic&quot; had relatively equivalent profiles, reaching roughly the same speed (between respectively) and the same passenger capacities, &quot;Homeric&quot; was significantly smaller and slower ( only). Additionally, the ship was less successful compared to its fellow liners. In fact, its career did not last long and it left the North Atlantic route in 1932, only ten years after its entry into service.

It was in August 1926 that a press release about a project from the company appeared for the first time, indicating the imminent construction of a 25-knot ship to replace &quot;Homeric&quot;. This ship must then, according to the press releases, be of a profile close to that of the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class vessels. The same year, in November, the International Mercantile Marine Co., a trust that owned the White Star Line, decided to separate from its non-American companies. The company was then bought by Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant, who integrated it into his company, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, the largest maritime conglomerate of the period. Lord Kylsant, who was also the owner of the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyards in Belfast, decided to have the planned ship built there. Studies for the planned construction were carried out over many months.

On 14 April 1927, construction of a fleetmate began in Harland &amp; Wolff. &quot;Britannic&quot; was a smaller version of the proposed liner, but of similar design. However, it was not until 18 June 1928 that a contract was signed to build the proposed liner; construction began ten days later. The liner was to be named &quot;Oceanic&quot;, in reference to the very first liner put into service by White Star after its purchase by Thomas Henry Ismay in 1871. Estimates gave it a length of over , , and a cost of £3.5 million, making it the largest liner ever built and the first to exceed the symbolic 1,000-foot mark. Construction of the ship&#x27;s keel began with great fanfare ten days after the contract was signed. The only existing plans of the ship remained sketchy and only allowed for understanding the general arrangement, but they did give an idea of the capacity of the liner: it would carry 722 passengers in first class, 464 in second, and 1,096 in third, and also 240 interchangeable seats between first and second class, and 286 between second and third, for a total of 2,808 passengers.

==Economic crisis and cancellation==

However, construction was proceeding at a very slow pace, to such an extent that a year later, the keel was still not completed. The work was slowed by a dispute over her powerplant; Lord Kylsant wanted to use diesel-electric instead of the then more common steam power to enable the ship&#x27;s speed to exceed 30 knots (a barrier not surpassed until the completion of in 1935). White Star proposed having over 40 diesel generator sets driving four propellers through geared electric motors. Harland and Wolff was reluctant to adopt this system, preferring to continue the use of trusted steam turbine propulsion as it seemed that not testing a new type of engine by installing it on smaller ships first was perilous. A compromise of sorts was reached and the final design used four conventional low-speed &#x27;cathedral&#x27; diesel engines, each directly driving one propeller shaft - which would have made &quot;Oceanic&quot; the first quadruple-screw motor ship. Despite construction on &quot;Oceanic&quot; slowing down, construction of the smaller &quot;Britannic&quot; continued without issues.
Further work on &quot;Oceanic&quot; was postponed after which the keel was coated in preservative oil in hopes construction would resume but the project was later cancelled due to the Great Depression and the collapse of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, owners of the White Star Line, as a result of the financial problems of Lord Kylsant. The Royal Mail Case, as it was known, led to the imprisonment of Kylsant, and to substantial changes in accounting and auditing practice. Loans backed by the governments of England and Northern Ireland intended for the construction of &quot;Oceanic&quot; were diverted to complete the construction of &quot;Britannic&quot;, as well as to start construction of a sister ship to &quot;Britannic&quot; named . These two liners were partially built with steel plates ordered for &quot;Oceanic&quot;, whose partially built hull was subsequently dismantled and reused on &quot;Britannic&quot; and &quot;Georgic&quot; after the aforementioned diversion of funds.

==Legacy==

In total, of the estimated cost of £3.5 million, £150,000 was spent on &quot;Oceanic&quot;″s design and start of construction. These sums were not, however, totally lost. Part of the design indeed inspired , a smaller ship which largely reproduced the silhouette of the aborted ship, in particular its packed funnels and its motor propulsion. The liner entered service in 1930 and enjoyed some success. To replace &quot;Oceanic&quot;, , a sister ship of &quot;Britannic&quot;, was built and put into service in 1932. &quot;Georgic&quot; differed in appearance from &quot;Britannic&quot; in that the forward part of her superstructure and bridge was rounded instead of straight, and the front part of her promenade deck was covered. These features were carried over to &quot;Georgic&quot; from &quot;Oceanic&quot;.

These two liners could not replace large ships like &quot;Majestic&quot; and &quot;Olympic&quot; and construction of a large liner remained on the agenda. The Cunard Line also had to stop the construction of its own large liner because of the economic crisis. Neville Chamberlain, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, pushed the shipping companies White Star and Cunard to merge in 1934, with the promise to help them finish the liner. This is how the Cunard-White Star Limited was formed and construction of the was able to resume. In 1947 Cunard purchased White Star&#x27;s interest, and by 1949 the company had dropped the White Star name and was renamed Cunard Line, which continued to operate &quot;Britannic&quot; and &quot;Georgic&quot;. In 1956, &quot;Georgic&quot; was sold for scrap, leaving &quot;Britannic&quot; as the last liner of the White Star Line in service. In 1960, Cunard sold the &quot;Britannic&quot; for scrap, removing the last traces of the &quot;Oceanic&quot;.

In appearance the planned &quot;Oceanic&quot; had certain features that make it akin to the liner , including the three short, wide funnels that contrasted with the tall narrow stacks of older ships. Designed shortly after &quot;Oceanic&quot;, the 300 meter-plus &quot;Normandie&quot; was the first to exceed the symbolic barriers of 1000 feet in length and 30 knots in speed that the White Star Line was aiming for.

<doc id="958561" wikidata="Q1335954" url="?curid=958561" title="Okurigana">
<text>are kana suffixes following kanji stems in Japanese written words. They serve two purposes: to inflect adjectives and verbs, and to force a particular kanji to have a specific meaning and be read a certain way. For example, the plain verb form (&quot;miru&quot;, &quot;see&quot;) inflects to past tense (&quot;mita&quot;, &quot;saw&quot;), where is the kanji stem, and る and た are okurigana, written in hiragana script. With very few exceptions, okurigana are only used for kun&#x27;yomi (native Japanese readings), not for on&#x27;yomi (Chinese readings), as Chinese morphemes do not inflect in Japanese, and their pronunciation is inferred from context, since many are used as parts of compound words (kango).

The technique in which native scripts are used to inflect adjectives or verbs may have initially taken after Korean scribal stategies, namely gugyeol, and later spread to Japan. When used to inflect an adjective or verb, okurigana can indicate aspect (perfective versus imperfective), affirmative or negative meaning, or grammatical politeness, among many other functions. In modern usage, okurigana are almost invariably written with hiragana; katakana were also commonly used in the past.

== English analogues ==
Analogous orthographic conventions find occasional use in English, which, being more familiar, help in understanding okurigana.

As an inflection example, when writing &quot;&quot; for &quot;cross-ing,&quot; as in &quot;Ped Xing&quot; (pedestrian crossing), the &quot;-ing&quot; is a verb suffix, while &quot;cross&quot; is the dictionary form of the verb – in this case &quot;cross&quot; is the reading of the character &quot;X,&quot; while &quot;-ing&quot; is analogous to okurigana. By contrast, in the noun &quot;&quot; for &quot;Christmas,&quot; the character &quot;Χ&quot; is instead read as &quot;Christ&quot; (it is actually a chi in origin, from the Greek Χριστός, &quot;Khristós&quot;). The suffixes serve as phonetic complements to indicate which reading to use.

Another common example is in ordinal and cardinal numbers – &quot;1&quot; is read as &quot;one,&quot; while &quot;1st&quot; is read as &quot;fir-st&quot;.

Note that word, morpheme (constituent part of word), and reading may be distinct: in &quot;1&quot;, &quot;one&quot; is at once the word, the morpheme, and the reading, while in &quot;1st&quot;, the word and the morpheme are &quot;first&quot;, while the &quot;reading&quot; is &quot;fir,&quot; as the &quot;-st&quot; is written separately, and in &quot;Xmas&quot; the word is &quot;Christmas&quot; while the morphemes are &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;,&quot; and the reading &quot;Christ&quot; coincides with the first morpheme.

==Inflection examples==

Adjectives in Japanese use okurigana to indicate aspect and affirmation-negation, with all adjectives using the same pattern of suffixes for each case. A simple example uses the character (high) to express the four basic cases of a Japanese adjective. The root meaning of the word is expressed via the kanji (, read &quot;taka&quot; and meaning &quot;high&quot; in each of these cases), but crucial information (aspect and negation) can only be understood by reading the okurigana following the kanji stem.

; (&quot;takai&quot;) : High (positive, imperfective), meaning &quot;[It is] expensive&quot; or &quot;[It is] high&quot;
; (&quot;takakunai&quot;) : High (negative, imperfective), meaning &quot;[It is] not expensive/high&quot;
; (&quot;takakatta&quot;) : High (positive, perfective), meaning &quot;[It was] expensive/high&quot;
; (&quot;takakunakatta&quot;) : High (negative, perfective), meaning &quot;[It was not] expensive/high&quot;

Japanese verbs follow a similar pattern; the root meaning is generally expressed by using one or more kanji at the start of the word, with aspect, negation, grammatical politeness, and other language features expressed by following okurigana.

; (&quot;taberu&quot;) : Eat (positive, imperfective, direct politeness), meaning &quot;[I/you/etc.] eat&quot;
; (&quot;tabenai&quot;) : Eat (negative, imperfective, direct), meaning &quot;[I/you/etc.] do not eat&quot;
; (&quot;tabeta&quot;) : Eat (positive, perfective, direct), meaning &quot;[I/you/etc.] ate/have eaten&quot;
; (&quot;tabenakatta&quot;) : Eat (negative, perfective, direct), meaning &quot;[I/you/etc.] did not eat/have not eaten&quot;

Compare the direct polite verb forms to their distant forms, which follow a similar pattern, but whose meaning indicates more distance between the speaker and the listener:

; (&quot;tabemasu&quot;) : Eat (positive, imperfective, distant politeness), meaning &quot;[My group/your group] eats&quot;
; (&quot;tabemasen&quot;) : Eat (negative, imperfective, distant), meaning &quot;[My group/your group] does not eat&quot;
; (&quot;tabemashita&quot;) : Eat (positive, perfective, distant), meaning &quot;[My group/your group] ate/has eaten&quot;
; (&quot;tabemasen deshita&quot;) : Eat (negative, perfective, distant), meaning &quot;[My group/your group] did not eat/has not eaten&quot;

== Disambiguation of kanji ==
Okurigana are also used as phonetic complements to disambiguate kanji that have multiple readings, and consequently multiple meanings. Since kanji, especially the most common ones, can be used for words with many (usually similar) meanings — but different pronunciations — key okurigana placed after the kanji help the reader to know which meaning and reading were intended. Both individual kanji and multi-kanji words may have multiple readings, and okurigana are used in both cases.

Okurigana for disambiguation are a &quot;partial&quot; gloss, and are &quot;required&quot;: for example, in , the stem is (and does not vary under inflection), and is pronounced (&quot;kudasa&quot;) – thus corresponds to the reading くだ (&quot;kuda&quot;), followed by (&quot;sa&quot;), which is written here &quot;kuda-sa.&quot; Note the okurigana are not considered part of the reading; grammatically the verb is &quot;kudasa-ru&quot; (verb stem + inflectional suffix), but orthographically the stem itself is analyzed as &quot;kuda-sa&quot; (kanji reading + okurigana). Compare with furigana, which specify the reading of the kanji, appear &quot;outside&quot; the line of the text, and which are &quot;omitted&quot; if understood.

Disambiguation examples include common verbs which use the characters (up) and (down):

; (&quot;a&quot;) : (&quot;a-garu&quot;) &quot;to ascend/to make ready/to complete&quot;, and (&quot;a-geru&quot;) &quot;to raise, to give (upwards)&quot;
; (&quot;nobo&quot;) : (&quot;nobo-ru&quot;) &quot;to go up/to climb (a set of stairs)&quot;, and (&quot;nobo-su&quot;) &quot;serve food, raise a matter (uncommon)&quot;
; (&quot;kuda&quot;) : (&quot;kuda-saru&quot;) &quot;to give [to the speaker from a superior]&quot;, and (&quot;kuda-ru&quot;) &quot;to be handed down [intransitive]&quot;
; (&quot;o&quot;) : (&quot;o-riru&quot;) &quot;to get off/to descend&quot; and (&quot;o-rosu&quot;) &quot;to let off (transitive)&quot;
; (&quot;sa&quot;) : (&quot;sa-garu&quot;) &quot;to dangle (intransitive)&quot;, and (&quot;sa-geru&quot;) &quot;to hang, to lower (transitive)&quot;

Observe that many Japanese verbs come in transitive/intransitive pairs, as illustrated above, and that a single kanji reading is shared between the two verbs, with sufficient okurigana written to reflect changed endings. The above okurigana are as short as possible, given this restriction – note for instance that (&quot;noboru&quot;) / (&quot;nobosu&quot;) are written as / , not as or , while must be written as to share a kanji reading with .

Another example includes a common verb with different meanings based on the okurigana:
; (&quot;hana-su&quot;) : &quot;to speak/to talk&quot;. Example: (&quot;chanto hanasu hō ga ii&quot;), meaning &quot;It&#x27;s better if you speak correctly.&quot;
; (&quot;hana-shi&quot;) : noun form of the verb hanasu, &quot;to speak&quot;. Example: (&quot;hanashi kotoba to kaki kotoba&quot;), meaning &quot;spoken words and written words&quot;.
; (&quot;hanashi&quot;) : noun, meaning &quot;a story&quot; or &quot;a talk&quot;. Example: (&quot;hanashi wa ikaga?&quot;), meaning &quot;How about a story?&quot;

Okurigana are not always sufficient to specify the reading. For example, (to become angry) can be read as (&quot;ika-ru&quot;) or (&quot;oko-ru&quot;) – and are not used – (to open) may be read either as (&quot;a-ku&quot;) or as (&quot;hira-ku&quot;) – is not used – and may be read either as (&quot;to-meru&quot;) or as (&quot;ya-meru&quot;) – is not used. In such cases the reading must be deduced from context or via furigana.

Ambiguity may be introduced in inflection – even if okurigana specify the reading in the base (dictionary) form of a verb, the inflected form may obscure it. For example, &quot;i-ku&quot; &quot;go&quot; and &quot;okona-u&quot; &quot;perform, carry out&quot; are distinct in dictionary form, but in past (&quot;perfective&quot;) form become &quot;i-tta&quot; &quot;went&quot; and &quot;okona-tta&quot; &quot;performed, carried out&quot; – which reading to use must be deduced from context or furigana.
One of the most complex examples of okurigana is the kanji , pronounced &quot;shō&quot; or &quot;sei&quot; in borrowed Chinese vocabulary, which stands for several native Japanese words as well:
* &quot;nama&quot; &#x27;raw&#x27; or &quot;ki&quot; &#x27;pure/unprocessed&#x27;
* &quot;o-u&quot; &#x27;grow/spring up&#x27;
* &quot;i-kiru&quot; &#x27;live&#x27;
* &quot;i-kasu&quot; &#x27;make use of (experience, skills)&#x27;
* &quot;i-keru&quot; &#x27;arrange (flowers)&#x27;
* &quot;u-mu&quot; &#x27;bear (child)/produce&#x27;
* &quot;u-mareru&quot;/&quot;uma-reru&quot; &#x27;be born&#x27;
* &quot;ha-eru&quot; &#x27;grow&#x27; (intransitive)
* &quot;ha-yasu&quot; &#x27;grow&#x27; (transitive)
as well as the hybrid Chinese-Japanese words
* &quot;shō-jiru&quot; &#x27;occur&#x27;, which is a modification of
* &quot;shō-zuru&quot; (single character + (rendaku of する))
Note that some of these verbs share a kanji reading (&quot;i,&quot; &quot;u,&quot; and &quot;ha&quot;), and okurigana are conventionally picked to maximize these sharings.

=== Multi-character words ===
Okurigana may also be used in multi-kanji words, where the okurigana specifies the pronunciation of the entire word, not simply the character that they follow; these distinguish multi-kanji native words from kango (borrowed Chinese words) with the same characters. Examples include nouns such as &quot;kikubari&quot; &quot;care, consideration&quot; versus &quot;kehai&quot; &quot;indication, hint, sign&quot; (note that the reading of changes between &quot;ki&quot; and &quot;ke&quot;, despite it not having an okurigana of its own), and verbs, such as &quot;hayaru&quot; &quot;be popular, be fashionable&quot;, versus &quot;ryūkō&quot; &quot;fashion&quot;. Note that in this later case, the native verb and the borrowed Chinese word with the same kanji have approximately the same meaning, but are pronounced differently.

Okurigana can also occur in the middle of a compound, such as &quot;ochiba&quot; &quot;fallen leaves&quot; and &quot;rakuyō&quot; &quot;fallen leaves, defoliation&quot; – note that the reading of the terminal changes between &quot;ba&quot; and &quot;yō&quot; despite it occurring after the okurigana.

=== Historical suffixes ===
For a few categories of words, okurigana correspond to historical suffixes which are no longer distinct or productive, and the suffix is now fused to the word, but still written in hiragana. This is particularly the case for words which function as adjectives, with notable categories including:
* &quot;-shii&quot; adjectives, such as &quot;ure-shii&quot; &quot;happy&quot;
* &quot;-yaka&quot; &quot;na&quot; adjectives, such as &quot;nigi-yaka(na)&quot; &quot;bustling, busy&quot;
* &quot;-raka&quot; &quot;na&quot; adjectives, such as &quot;aki-raka(na)&quot; &quot;clear, obvious&quot;
* &quot;-taru&quot; adjectives, such as &quot;dōdō-taru&quot; &quot;magnificent, stately&quot;
* &quot;-naru&quot; adjectives, such as &quot;tan-naru&quot; &quot;mere, simple&quot;
Note that only the &quot;-i&quot; in &quot;-shii&quot; inflects; the other kana are invariant, and in practice serve only for disambiguation and to reflect historical grammar. Briefly, &quot;-shii&quot; adjectives used to be a different class from &quot;-i&quot; adjectives (distinguished historically as &quot;-ku&quot; and &quot;-shiku&quot; adjectives, for present &quot;-i&quot; and &quot;-shii&quot;), but have since merged; &quot;-yaka&quot; and &quot;-raka&quot; used to be suffixes, but are no longer productive, while &quot;-taru&quot; and &quot;-naru&quot; are historical variants of what is now the adjective particle &quot;-na&quot;. See Japanese adjectives for details.

==Informal rules==
===Verbs===

The okurigana for group I verbs ( &quot;godan dōshi&quot;, also known as &quot;u&quot;-verbs) usually begin with the final mora of the dictionary form of the verb.
: &quot;no-mu&quot; to drink, &quot;itada-ku&quot; to receive, &quot;yashina-u&quot; to cultivate, &quot;ne-ru&quot; to twist

For group II verbs ( &quot;ichidan dōshi&quot;, also known as &quot;ru&quot;-verbs) the okurigana begin at the mora preceding the last, unless the word is only two morae long.
: &quot;samata-geru&quot; to prevent, &quot;ta-beru&quot; to eat, &quot;shi-meru&quot; to comprise, &quot;ne-ru&quot; to sleep, &quot;ki-ru&quot; to wear

If the verb has different variations, such as transitive and intransitive forms, then the different morae are written in kana, while the common part constitutes a single common kanji reading for all related words.
: &quot;shi-meru&quot; to close (transitive), &quot;shi-maru&quot; to close (intransitive) – in both cases the reading of is &quot;shi&quot;.
: &quot;o-chiru&quot; to fall, &quot;o-tosu&quot; to drop – in both cases the reading of is &quot;o&quot;.

In other cases (different verbs with similar meanings, but which are not strictly variants of each other), the kanji will have different readings, and the okurigana thus also indicate which reading to use.
: &quot;obiya-kasu&quot; to threaten (mentally), &quot;odo-su&quot; to threaten (physically)

===Adjectives===

Most adjectives ending in &quot;-i&quot; (true adjectives) have okurigana starting from the &quot;-i&quot;.
: &quot;yasu-i&quot;, &quot;taka-i&quot;, &quot;aka-i&quot;

Okurigana starts from &quot;shi&quot; for adjectives ending in &quot;-shii&quot; (this reflects historical grammar; see above).
: &quot;tano-shii&quot;, &quot;ichijiru-shii&quot;, &quot;mazu-shii&quot;

Exceptions occur when the adjective also has a related verbal form. In this case, as with related verbs (above), the reading of the character is kept constant, and the okurigana are exactly the morae that differ.
: &quot;atata-meru&quot; (verb), &quot;atata-kai&quot; (adjective) – in both cases is read &quot;atata&quot;.
: &quot;tano-mu&quot; (verb), &quot;tano-moshii&quot; (adjective) – in both cases is read &quot;tano&quot;.

As with verbs, okurigana are also used to distinguish between readings (unrelated adjectives with the same kanji), in which case the okurigana indicate which reading to use.
: &quot;hoso-i&quot;, &quot;koma-kai&quot;; &quot;ō-ini&quot;, &quot;ō-kii&quot;

Na-adjectives (adjectival verbs) that end in &quot;-ka&quot; have okurigana from the &quot;ka&quot;.
: &quot;shizu-ka&quot;, &quot;tashi-ka&quot;, &quot;yuta-ka&quot;, &quot;oro-ka&quot;

===Adverbs===

The last mora of an adverb is usually written as okurigana.
: &quot;sude-ni&quot;, &quot;kanara-zu&quot;, &quot;suko-shi&quot;
Note that such adverbs are often written in kana, such as &quot;matta-ku&quot; and &quot;moppa-ra&quot; .

=== Nouns ===
Nouns do not normally have okurigana.
: &quot;tsuki&quot;, &quot;sakana&quot;, &quot;kome&quot;
In some cases the reading is then ambiguous, and must be deduced from context or by furigana.
: &quot;nama&quot; or &quot;ki&quot;
: &quot;tetsu&quot; or &quot;kurogane&quot; (&quot;tetsu&quot; is usual)

However, if the noun is derived from a verb or adjective, it may take the same okurigana, although some may be omitted in certain cases (see below). The derivation may not be apparent if it is old and the verb is no longer in use (see below).
: &quot;a-tari&quot; (from &quot;a-taru&quot;), &quot;ika-ri&quot; (from &quot;ika-ru&quot;), &quot;tsu-ri&quot; (from &quot;tsu-ru&quot;), &quot;kiza-shi&quot; (from &quot;kiza-su&quot;)

For some nouns it is obligatory to omit the okurigana, despite having a verbal origin.
: &quot;hanashi&quot; (from &quot;hana-su&quot;), &quot;kōri&quot; (from &quot;kō-ru&quot;), &quot;tatami&quot; (from &quot;tata-mu&quot;)

In these cases, the noun form of the corresponding verb does take okurigana.
: &quot;hana-shi&quot; is the nominal form of the verb &quot;hana-su&quot;, and not the noun &quot;hanashi&quot;.
Formally, the verbal noun (VN, still retaining verbal characteristics) takes okurigana, as is usual for verbs, while the deverbal noun (DVN, without verbal characteristics) does not take okurigana, as is usual for nouns.

To understand this grammatical distinction, compare the English present participle (verb form ending in &quot;-ing&quot;, indicating continuous aspect) and the gerund (noun form of the &quot;-ing&quot; verb form, which is a verbal noun) versus deverbal forms (which are irregular):
:&quot;I am learning Japanese&quot; (verb) and &quot;Learning is fun&quot; (verbal noun) versus the deverbal &quot;Alexandria was a center of learning&quot; (here &quot;learning&quot; is being used as synonymous with &quot;knowledge&quot;, rather than an activity)

Similarly, some nouns are derived from verbs, but written with different kanji, in which case no okurigana are used.
: &quot;hori&quot; moat, from &quot;hori&quot; (nominal form of &quot;horu&quot; to dig)
In other cases a kanji may be derived from another verb or verb combination and retain the okurigana:
: &quot;shiawa-se&quot; from &quot;shi-awa-se&quot;

Some okurigana come from Old Japanese, and the underlying verb is no longer in use.
: &quot;saiwa-i&quot; from earlier &quot;saihahi&quot;
: &quot;ikio-i&quot; from &quot;ikio-fu&quot; (compare &quot;sei&quot;)
Note that these &quot;-i&quot; suffixes are not &quot;i&quot;-adjectives – they are the ends of verb stems.

===Compounds===

In compounds, okurigana may be omitted if there is no ambiguity in meaning or reading – in other words, if that compound is only read a single way. If okurigana occur after several characters (esp. both in the middle of the compound and at the end of the compound, as in 2-character compounds), either only the middle okurigana, or both the middle and the final okurigana may be omitted; omitting only the final okurigana but retaining the middle okurigana is rather unusual and somewhat questionable, though not unknown (marked with “?” below).
: &quot;u-ke tsu-ke&quot;, &quot;uke tsu-ke&quot;, &quot;?u-ke tsuke&quot;, &quot;uke tsuke&quot;
: &quot;i-ki saki&quot;, &quot;iki saki&quot;
This is particularly done for Japanese compound verbs (the okurigana inflection of the first, main verb is dropped), as above. This is especially common in reducing or removing kana in formulaic constructions, particularly in signs. For example, in the common phrase (&quot;tachi-iri kin-shi&quot;, Do not enter; literally, entry prohibited) in analyzed as , but the okurigana are usually dropped.

If the compound is unfamiliar to the reader, there is the risk of it being incorrectly read with &quot;on&quot; readings, rather than the &quot;kun&quot; readings – for example, &quot;drive-in forbidden&quot; is read &quot;nori-ire-kin-shi&quot; () – the first two characters are a compound verb – but an unfamiliar reader may guess &quot;jōnyū-kinshi&quot; based on the &quot;on&quot; readings. However, this is not a problem with familiar compounds, whose reading is already known.

Okurigana are avoided in compounds where the reading cannot easily be analyzed into readings of the individual characters, as these are confusing – the reading simply must be learnt separately. These include especially ateji and gikun, as well as cases where a compound word has changed pronunciation over the years, and is no longer a simple combination of the compounds. For example, &quot;i-buki&quot; &quot;breath&quot; is specifically prescribed to &quot;not&quot; have okurigana – there is the related verb &quot;i-bu-ku&quot; &quot;to breathe&quot;, which must have okurigana for inflection, but is otherwise pronounced &quot;iki,&quot; so there is the risk of misreading as *&quot;iki-buki.&quot; This is formalized for the words in the addendum to the Jōyō list in the second category of exceptions, listed below.

===Exceptions===
The above rules are guidelines, and there are exceptions and special cases that must be learnt individually: okurigana that has become standard for historical reasons (now obscure or not obvious at a glance) or by convention rather than logic. Compare for instance:
: &quot;aka-rui&quot; – rather than &quot;akaru-i&quot;
: &quot;a-kari&quot; ( &quot;aka-ri&quot; also acceptable)
These both originally derived from the verb &quot;aka-ru,&quot; which is no longer in use; the first is an irregularly derived &quot;i&quot;-adjective, while the latter is a deverbal noun. Compare &quot;a-ku&quot; and &quot;aki-raka&quot;.

== Formal rules ==
The Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT) prescribes rules on how to use okurigana, giving standardized Japanese orthography. The original notification (see references) is from 1973, but it was amended in 1981 when the jōyō kanji table was issued.

The rules apply to kun&#x27;yomi (native Japanese readings) of kanji in the jōyō kanji table; they do not apply to kanji outside the jōyō kanji table, or kanji without kun&#x27;yomi (with only on&#x27;yomi, Chinese readings). The notification gives 7 general rules () and 2 rules for difficult cases () in the jōyō kanji table&#x27;s word list attachment (). The first 2 rules (1 &amp; 2) address words that conjugate, the next 3 rules (3–5) address words that do not conjugate, and the last 2 rules (6 &amp; 7) address compound words. Whenever there&#x27;s doubt whether something is permissible use () or not, the general rule () is to be followed. In some cases, variations are permitted, when there is no danger of confusion; in other case, when there is danger of confusion, variations are not permitted.

Scope:
* The notification provides the basis for okurigana usage in laws, official documents, newspapers, magazines, broadcasts, and similar places where modern Japanese is written using the readings given in the jōyō kanji table.
* The notification does not attempt to regulate the use of okurigana in science, technology, art, and other special fields or in writing of individuals.
* The notification does not apply to proper nouns or kanji used as symbols.
* Okurigana are not used for on readings, and they are not mentioned in the rules except where necessary.
Examples for each rule, with permitted variations:
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (for read as ) and (for read as ).
:This rule states that one needs to write (at least) the part of the word that changes under inflection – the last mora.
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (for read as ), but is also explicitly permitted ().
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (for read as ). is not allowed by the rules, because it could be mistaken for ().
:In Japanese, there are many pairs of transitive/intransitive verbs, some of which differ in the last mora, other of which differ in the second to last mora, as in this example. This is the case illustrated here in , though the rule also addresses other points.
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (for read as ), but is permitted () because there&#x27;s no fear of it being misread.
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage .
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage .
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage . When used as the continuative form of , the form is to be used instead.
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (for read as ), but is permitted () because there&#x27;s no fear of it being misread.
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage .
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (for ), but is permitted () because there&#x27;s no fear of it being misread.
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (for ), but and are permitted () because there&#x27;s no fear of their being misread.
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage (iteration mark), but (no iteration mark if okurigana are present).
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage .
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage .
* The 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes () the okurigana usage .

===Special cases===
There are 16 special cases listed, 7 where okurigana are required or recommended, 9 where it is forbidden. These refer to prescribed spellings of words on the attachment to the Jōyō kanji list.

Required or recommended (acceptable alternatives in parentheses) ():
* 
* 
* 

Forbidden ():
* &quot;i-buki&quot;
* &quot;sa-jiki&quot;
* &quot;shigure&quot;
* &quot;tsuki-yama&quot; (avoid confusion with &quot;kizu-ki&quot;)
* &quot;na-gori&quot; (avoid confusion with &quot;noko-ri&quot;)
* &quot;nadare&quot; (avoid confusion with &quot;kuzu-re&quot;)
* &quot;fubuki&quot;
* &quot;mai-go&quot; (avoid confusion with &quot;mayo-i&quot;)
* &quot;yuku-e&quot;

== Issues ==
=== Variation ===
While MEXT prescribes rules and permitted variations, in practice there is much variation – permitted or not – particularly in older texts (prior to guidelines) and online – note that these rules are not prescriptive for personal writings, but only in official documents and media. As an example, the standard spelling of the word &quot;kuregata&quot; is , but it will sometimes be seen as .

=== Sound change ===
While okurigana are sufficient to show inflection of adjectives and verbs, in rare cases further sound change occurs that affects the stem, and must be inferred from the okurigana, without being explicitly written. An everyday example is , where the stem would normally be pronounced , as this comes from the &quot;i&quot;-adjective – the &quot;a&quot; → &quot;o&quot; sound change must be inferred from the following &quot;-u&quot;. This sound change is due to this being a polite adjective form.

If there is additional non-inflectional okurigana, then these are change, and this is sufficient to show the sound change in the spelling. This occurs for adjectives ending in &quot;-shii,&quot; like , hence . A basic example other than &quot;-shii&quot; of such okurigana use is , from .

=== Confusion with compounds ===
There is a risk of confusion of okurigana with compounds: some Japanese words are traditionally written with kanji, but today some of these kanji are hyōgaiji (uncommon characters), and hence are often written as a mixture of kanji and kana, the uncommon characters being replaced by kana; this is known as mazegaki. The resulting orthography is seen by some as confusing and unsightly, particularly if it is the second character that is written in kana – the kana characters are where okurigana would be expected to go – and this is one motivation for expansions of kanji lists. For example, until the 2010 expansion of the jōyō kanji, the word &quot;kanpeki&quot; (perfect) was officially written , not as the compound , since the character was not on the official list, and &quot;takarakuji&quot; (lottery) is officially (and also popularly) written as , not as , since the second character is not in the jōyō kanji and is also quite complicated. This is less of an issue when the first kanji is written in kana, as in (&quot;yashi-kaku,&quot; coconut shell), which is formally .

=== Unwritten particles ===
Converse to okurigana, where part of the pronunciation of a word is written after the kanji, in some cases following kana is dropped (or included in the reading of the previous character). This is primarily for the attributive particles &quot;-no&quot; (sometimes written in katakana as ) and &quot;-ga&quot; (sometimes written or ), and is most common in names. For example, the common family name Inoue (&quot;I-no-ue&quot; Well’s top, top of well) is generally written , though if the particle were written it would be . Similarly, Amagasaki (&quot;Ama-ga-saki,&quot; Nun’s peak) is generally written , but can be written , and Sen no Rikyū is written (here the particle is between the family and given name). This can sometimes cause ambiguity, as in the Yamanote Line (for a time called the Yamate Line) and the Agatsuma Line (which could be read as Azuma). Particles are considered grammatically separate from the attached word (they are not an inflection), and this is not considered okurigana, despite some superficial similarities.

=== Other affixes ===
Japanese has various affixes, some of which are written in kana and should not be confused with okurigana. Most common are the honorifics, which are generally suffixes, such as &quot;-san&quot; (Mr., Ms.), and bikago (, &quot;beautified language&quot;), such as and as in (&quot;ocha,&quot; tea).

<text>Alaska Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. state of Alaska, observed on October 18. It is the anniversary of the formal transfer of territories in present-day Alaska from the Russian Empire to the United States, which occurred on Friday, October 18, 1867.

==Background==
On March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It was not until October of that year that the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 United States Army troops, who marched to the governor&#x27;s house at &quot;Castle Hill&quot;. There, the American soldiers raised the American flag, and the Russian flag was lowered.

The official account of the affair as presented by General Lovell Rousseau to Secretary of State William H. Seward:

Due to the 11-hour time difference between Sitka and St. Petersburg, and the fact that Russia still used the Julian calendar, the date is sometimes given as Saturday, October 7.

==Observance==

Alaska&#x27;s territorial legislature declared Alaska Day a holiday in 1917. It is a paid holiday for state employees. The annual celebration is held in Sitka, where schools release students early, many businesses close for the day, and events such as a parade and reenactment of the flag-raising are held.

It should not be confused with Seward&#x27;s Day, the last Monday in March, another state holiday commemorating the signing of the treaty for the Alaska Purchase in which the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia on March 30, 1867.

==Modern view==
Alaska Day is protested by some Alaska Native people, who view the holiday as a celebration of the violence used to take their land away. Native organizers assert that the land was not Russia&#x27;s to sell in the first place; therefore, the sale of the land to the U.S. is illegitimate. Even despite being a holiday tradition in Alaska and October 18 being marked the day Russia transferred Alaska to the United States, some Alaska Natives have argued about the holiday as cultural genocide, and there is a chance of healing in time. A former resident of Sitka, Peter Bradley, had given an idea about a resolution that called for renaming Alaska Day to Reconciliation Day.

<doc id="958564" wikidata="Q1955445" url="?curid=958564" title="Muslimgauze">
<text>Muslimgauze was the main musical project of Bryn Jones (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British ethnic electronica and experimental musician who was influenced by conflicts and history in the Muslim world, often with an emphasis on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never achieved mainstream success. His music has been described by one critic as &quot;among the most startling and unique in the noise underground.&quot;

Despite his project name, Jones never converted to Islam. The name Muslimgauze is a play on the word &quot;muslin&quot; (a type of gauze) combined with &quot;Muslim&quot;, referring to Jones&#x27; preoccupation with conflicts throughout the Muslim world.

==Biography==
===Early musical career===
Jones first released music in 1982 as on Kinematograph, his own imprint, and the independent co-op label Recloose, run by Simon Crab. came from the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos of the time and was musically composed of electronic/experimental drone with occasional synth-melodic hooks and use of radio broadcast samples.

Releases at the time were occasionally on cassette, more often vinyl EPs and LPs; the longest-running of Jones&#x27; label monikers, Limited Editions, started with &quot;Hunting Out with an Aerial Eye&quot; (1984) followed by &quot;Buddhist on Fire&quot;, put out by Recloose the same year. Since then, Jones roughly released an album a year, given scarce financial resources until 1988, when he began making inroads with then-emerging labels Staalplaat, Soleilmoon, and Extreme Records.

By the late 1980s, Jones ran out of funding to self-release, and other labels that did put out Muslimgauze releases such as Recloose and Permis De Construire (which put out &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot;) did not pay promised royalties. Recloose head Simon Crab cited lack of sales and damaged records from firebombing as his reason.

At this time, distributors Soleilmoon, Staalplaat, and Extreme Records transitioned to becoming labels with the advent of the compact disc format, which became less expensive to produce and ship than vinyl over time and gradually became a physical staple of the Muslimgauze catalogue.

===Later musical career===

It was with the release of &quot;United States of Islam&quot; (1991) a formalised agreement was reached with Extreme Records, which helped fund professional studio recordings, designed attractive packaging, and used a more extensive distribution network. Though pleased at first, Jones was frustrated with Extreme&#x27;s one-release-a-year policy and in 1993 signed with then-sibling labels Soleilmoon and Staalplaat, which offered a more frequent release schedule. 1993 saw the release of &quot;Vote Hezbollah&quot;, &quot;Veiled Sisters&quot; and a re-release of &quot;Iran&quot; on Soleilmoon and &quot;Hamas Arc&quot;, &quot;Satyajit Eye&quot; and &quot;Betrayal&quot; on Staalplaat. His 1998 record &quot;Mullah Said&quot; on the label has been critically acclaimed.

Jones additionally released material on nearly any small label that approached him. A drawback with releasing on so many labels was gratuitous editing by producers and, through design or circumstance, no royalties. Extreme cited betrayal by distribution networks that were unscrupulous or filed for bankruptcy and could not pay—though they also claimed to have eventually remunerated Jones. Lack of due royalties was a source of ongoing stress throughout Jones&#x27;s career.

Jones once stated that he never had time to listen to other people&#x27;s music, although in a 1992 interview with &quot;Impulse Magazine&quot;, he mentioned that he enjoyed traditional music of Japan, the Middle East, and India, as well as the works of artists such as Can, Throbbing Gristle, Wire, and Faust.

===Death===
On 30 December 1998, Jones was rushed to A&amp;E in Manchester with a rare fungal infection in his bloodstream, for which he had to be heavily sedated. He contracted pneumonia and died on 14 January 1999.

==Legacy==
Since Bryn Jones&#x27;s death in 1999 at the age of 37, his music under Muslimgauze has continued to be released. He often inundated labels and collaborators with music, and consequently the latter had to be selective of what was eventually put out. Labels, including Soleilmoon and Staalplaat, continue to publish unreleased albums, as well as releases of demos, his own reworked tracks, and abandoned full-length tapes. Jones&#x27; posthumous discography is known for including many studio variations of nearly all his music.

In April 2014, Vinyl On Demand released &quot;Chasing the Shadow of Bryn Jones 1983–1988&quot;, a 10 LP box set reissuing early albums originally released by Product Kinematograph, Recloose Organisation, and Jones&#x27; own Limited Editions. Each LP includes bonus tracks taken from period compilation albums. The release was also accompanied by biography written by Ibrahim Khider titled &quot;Muslimgauze: Chasing the Shadow of Bryn Jones&quot;.

==Musical styles==
Muslimgauze&#x27;s music is often difficult to describe due to sheer volume, content diversity and often singular stylings; Jones never produced any hit albums or songs. However, it&#x27;s possible to describe common features of his music as he tended to use many of the same strategies, modified from album to album to give each release a distinct feel or concept. The music is often heavily electronic and strongly rhythmic (sometimes including live studio percussion), though tempos can vary from very fast to slowly driving and almost ambient, making frequent use of gradually changing structures or melodic motifs. Critic Ned Raggett reviewed a number of Muslimgauze albums for Allmusic.com, noting the diverse styles of Jones&#x27;s recordings: &quot;United States of Islam&quot; (1991) featured layered percussion and &quot;a muted techno pulse&quot;, &quot;Hamas Arc&quot; (1993) touched on a menacing &quot;ambience that is not so far removed from the likes of [industrial metal acts] Godflesh or Scorn&quot;, and &quot;Gun Aramaic&quot; (1996) blended atmospheric sounds and vocal samples that &quot;almost turns the album into a soundtrack for a non-existent film.&quot;

==Political beliefs==
Jones originally claimed Muslimgauze was formed in response to Operation Peace of the Galilee, Israel&#x27;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon. This event inspired Jones to research the conflict&#x27;s origins, which grew into a lifelong artistic focal point, and he became a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, and often dedicated recordings to the Palestinian Liberation Organization or a free Palestine. Jones&#x27;s research further grew to encompass other conflict-ridden, predominantly Muslim countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Chechnya, Iran, and Iraq. He concluded that Western interests for natural resources and strategic-political gain were root causes for many of these conflicts and should Western meddling halt, said regions would stabilise.

Jones frequently netted criticism for never having visited the Middle East. He said in a 1994 interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t think you can visit an occupied land. It&#x27;s the principle. Not until it&#x27;s free again.&quot;
References in dedications, album, and track titles suggest Jones had researched the conflict regions in the Middle East, as well as Chechnya, Kashmir, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, among others. He opposed the oppression of and dedicated pieces to Tibetan Buddhists and Tamil Tigers.

When asked what he would do if conflicts in the Muslim world were peaceably resolved, Jones replied his music would champion other conflict regions such as China&#x27;s occupation of Tibet.

Simon Crab of Bourbonese Qualk described Jones as &quot;naturally Conservative and quite right-wing,&quot; noting that Jones admired Margaret Thatcher during his youth. Though Crabb states, &quot;I suspect a lot of this was just to be contrary.&quot;

==Discography==
Jones released over 90 original albums on 32 different record labels, creating nearly 2,000 original compositions. Many of his pieces were inspired by political facts or events. Many of his releases have been re-pressed as, after 1994, most of his albums were released in limited editions of 200–1,000.

==Live performances==
During the early phase of his career, Jones was known to have performed only one live show in 1986 at the V2 in s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. At the behest of Bourbonese Qualk, of the Recloose label, Jones performed a half-hour set. The show consisted of Jones singing to a backing track while Simon Crab then members of Bourbonese Qualk added instrumental accompaniment. By all accounts the show went reasonably, but Jones was traumatised by the experience enough to swear off live performance until the 1990s.

Jones resumed live performance in 1995 at the behest of record store owner and DJ Simon Scott. Part of Jones&#x27;s apprehension with live performance was in trying to figure out how to present the music. He concluded the best way was refrain from vocals with lyrics and instead play live percussion atop a backing track. He also did DJ sets that consisted of exclusively his own material. Contrary to his 1986 experience, Jones did enjoy doing live shows and frequently did them in his last years in diverse places such as the UK, throughout mainland Europe, and even Japan.

<text>Space Patrol is a British science fiction television series featuring marionettes that was produced in 1962 and broadcast from the beginning of April 1963. It was written and produced by Roberta Leigh in association with ABC Weekend TV.

==Summary==
The series features the vocal talents of Dick Vosburgh, Ronnie Stevens, Libby Morris, Murray Kash and Ysanne Churchman, and comprises 39 half-hour episodes. This series is also known by its US title Planet Patrol to avoid confusion with the 1950s American live-action series of the same name. The marionettes used in the series incorporated some elements of Gerry Anderson&#x27;s Supermarionation technique – specifically their mouths would move in synch with dialogue; Leigh had previously worked with Anderson on the series &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; and first series of &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot;, though Anderson would not develop Supermarionation until after his association with Leigh ended.

The series is set in the year 2100, by which time the indigenous and autonomous civilisations on Earth, Mars and Venus have banded together to form the United Galactic Organization (UGO). Space Patrol is the UGO&#x27;s military wing, and the series follows the actions of this interplanetary force, focusing on the missions of a tiny unit led by the heroic, bearded Captain Larry Dart. The humanoids in his crew consist of the elfin Slim from Venus, and the stocky, ravenously sausage-mad Husky from the Red Planet, Mars. The imperfect Slavic accent variants and six-pointed star chest emblems of these two may have been a sly nod to the Jewish-Russian heritage of the English series creator/writer. These men would regularly use one of two interplanetary space vehicles, the &quot;Galasphere 347&quot; and the &quot;Galasphere 024&quot;.

Providing technical support on Earth is the brilliant and inventive Irishman Professor Aloysius O’Brien O’Rourke Haggarty, called &quot;Pop&quot; by his daughter Cassiopeia, to his perpetual dismay. Haggarty&#x27;s garrulous pet Martian &quot;parrot&quot; (a Gabblerdictum bird), taught to talk in &quot;The Slaves of Neptune&quot; episode, accompanies the crew on rare occasions. Keeping them all on a tight rein are Colonel Raeburn and his super-efficient Venusian secretary, Marla, both also based on Earth.

The show reflected sex roles characteristic of the culture and era which produced it, but blonde and brainy Marla would often explicitly point out that &quot;There are no dumb blondes on Venus.&quot; Indeed, the series was created and written by the prolific polymath artist Roberta Leigh, the first woman producer in Britain to have her own film company.

The series was sold overseas and broadcast in the US, Canada and Australia, and in spite of the very low budget – which meant that sometimes the shadow of a puppet could be seen behind a &quot;TV Screen&quot; before the communication device was supposedly turned on —the show rated strongly with young audiences in many regions (including New York City) and garnered a huge following. &quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator J. Michael Straczynski said that it was his favourite TV show as a child.

==The science==
Whereas Gerry Anderson had a rocket ship in &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; that could travel light-years to planets around other stars as though they were just a few million miles away, Space Patrol took a more realistic approach. Because of limited speed, trips to other planets in our solar system could take weeks or months and this was facilitated by the crew of the Galasphere going into a freezer chamber and being put in suspended animation for the trip. A robot would then take over (its movements were said to cost £2,000 a time rather than being just a puppet). The ray (faster than light) could be used from Earth to wake them up in an emergency. The term &quot;galaxy&quot; was used inaccurately, but consistently, except in the episode &quot;The Talking Bell&quot; when solar system was used, to refer to our solar system in the series, so &quot;Galactic Control&quot; only supervised the local planets and &quot;other galaxies&quot; referred to nearby star-systems.

On other planets, they would use dial-selector translators (dial P for Pluto) to talk to alien beings—at the time, even some serious scientists considered the possibility of life on Venus, Mars and maybe elsewhere. Unusually for a TV show, the translators did not instantly pick up new languages; they had to be programmed on Earth before they could be used, a lengthy process requiring recordings of the alien language. Life support in hazardous atmospheres was provided by a &quot;Mo-lung&quot; (short for &#x27;Mobile Lung&#x27;)—a sealed cylindrical transparent helmet, and the crew would often ride around on &quot;Hover Jets&quot;, or more rarely, an &quot;Ion Gun&quot; which looked like a giant sparkler firework. Neptune was said to have atomic heating but none of the planets were really cold, such as when Dart walked about on Pluto (in &quot;The Buried Spaceship&quot;) without any extra protection in what would be temperatures of about −230 °C.

The Galasphere had a top speed of about 800,000 mph, using &quot;meson power&quot;. In &quot;The Talking Bell&quot;, they use &quot;Boost Speed&quot;, which is dangerous, but allows them to travel at almost one million miles per hour for a long period. Meson power is dangerous to use in atmosphere. The engine also used gamma rays and &#x27;Yobba rays&#x27;. The Galasphere has a force field which would protect it from enemy missiles, and it also turned out to protect them from the mind control of the evil Neptunians who were thousands of years ahead of Earth people, with great mental powers, and who hated work.

The Galasphere was constructed of Plutonite from Pluto, and a number of times, like in &quot;The Human Fish&quot;, it also travelled underwater. Pluto was the furthest they normally travelled but after an accident they went way beyond that to a self-heated new planet which was full of giants who treated the Galasphere as a toy. Another time, an alien from Alpha Centauri visited them and installed a device which allowed the Galasphere to travel faster than light (at which point it vanished). They had their adventure twenty five trillion miles away and then returned to Earth, and just made it, with Galasphere 347 collapsing under the strain of such travel, just as they left it. In &quot;The Planet of Light&quot;, Dart and Slim were taken to a planet circling Sirius (8.7 light-years away) in just a few hours. This fast journey was necessary as the &quot;light beings&quot; who took them would be poisoned by air, so the two had to rely on their own supplies.

In &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; and a minority of other episodes, the crew rode the Galasphere 024, rather than the Galasphere 347. The references to Galasphere 024 are, for the most part, continuity errors introduced by the continual re-use of stock footage from the pilot episode, &quot;The Swamps of Jupiter&quot;. Although the Galasphere is referred to as 024 during the takeoff programme sequence, it is often later referred to as 347 in the same episode.

Colin Ronan is listed as Space Consultant in the end credits.

==Production==
The series was filmed in converted church buildings in Stoke Newington and Harlesden, London. The production was completed in two blocks consisting of 26 and 13 episodes, which are considered as the first series. The final 13 episodes employ refurbished puppets and sets, and are copyrighted 1962 Wonderama Productions on the end credits (the first 26 episodes omitted any on-screen copyright information).

Various puppets from the series were re-used in later Roberta Leigh productions including &quot;Wonderboy and Tiger&quot; and &quot;Send for Dithers&quot;. These colour films reveal the fact that the Gabblerdictum was bright pink. Other than two endpapers from the &quot;TV Comic Annual&quot; for 1966, no colour photographic materials from the series have survived. These images indicate that the puppets were dressed in monochromatic uniforms, although most comic strip and book illustrations depict them as red and silver. Slim&#x27;s darker complexion in the series suggests that the Venusians and Martians were repainted in their &#x27;correct&#x27; skin tone for this batch of episodes, although no colour stills from the second series are known to exist.

Leigh had previously worked with Gerry Anderson on children&#x27;s puppet series, and there are some obvious similarities between &quot;Space Patrol&quot; and Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, although &quot;Space Patrol&quot; was made on a lower budget. Arthur Provis, Anderson&#x27;s former business partner in AP Films was responsible for the cinematography. For many years it was believed that all but a handful of episodes had been destroyed, until a complete cache of 16 mm prints was discovered in the garage of Roberta Leigh&#x27;s home. Despite their scratched and grainy condition, they were of sufficient historic interest to warrant a commercial release, initially on VHS tapes, and later on DVD. Two episodes have survived from the original 35 mm prints and these were later made available on Blu-ray Disc.

===Style of the series===
Although compared (and often confused) with the Gerry Anderson productions (due to the similar use of voice-synchronised marionettes), &quot;Space Patrol&quot; is distinguished by some of its creative choices. The only music involved is &quot;avant-garde&quot;, the theme being made by Roberta Leigh herself using electronic equipment she bought locally after asking an assistant for anything that made interesting noises. F. C. Judd was responsible for creating all the electronic music for the series; he was an early British electronic experimenter, amateur radio expert, circuit designer, author and contributor to many wireless and electronics magazines from the 1950s to the 1990s.

In addition, the marionettes used for &quot;Space Patrol&quot; were more realistic-looking and less cartoon-like than those being used on &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;; in terms of relative realism, the puppets of &quot;Space Patrol&quot; fall between that of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;. There were two types of robots, and the ones with the thick upper bodies were mainly used.

Final credits always showed panoramic views over a gigantic city of the future, and never featured any music; only the throb of some industrial machinery, sounding like a gigantic pump or a steam engine beating rhythmically. A model of London&#x27;s GPO tower can be seen among the other futuristic buildings; when this series was filmed, the GPO tower was still in the early stages of construction. The male characters from the planet Venus (Slim for example) had obvious androgynous features (in contrast to the more rustic and virile Martians). Venusians also only had three fingers and a thumb.

Episodes known to have been released in this format are: &quot;The Swamps of Jupiter&quot;, &quot;The Miracle Tree of Saturn&quot;, &quot;The Robot Revolution&quot; and &quot;Mystery on the Moon.&quot; The films were released in 400&#x27; sound editions, and packaging for all titles used the same artwork as the first release, &quot;Mystery on the Moon.&quot; The title &quot;Space Patrol&quot; did not appear anywhere on the packaging. The films were all around 16 minutes long, with most of the material coming from the second act of the episodes. The complete series was released by Network on VHS tape following the recovery of the episodes in the late 1990s.

<doc id="958572" wikidata="Q648824" url="?curid=958572" title="Glenn Hall">
<text>Glenn Henry Hall (born October 3, 1931) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. During his National Hockey League career with the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Black Hawks, and St. Louis Blues, Hall seldom missed a game and was a consistent performer, winning the Vezina Trophy, which at the time was awarded to the goaltender on the team allowing the fewest goals against (a distinction that now results in being awarded the William M. Jennings Trophy), three times, being voted the First team All-Star goaltender a record seven times, and winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as best rookie. Nicknamed &quot;Mr. Goalie&quot;, he was the first goaltender to develop and make effective use of the butterfly style of goalkeeping. In 2017 Hall was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. He is the grandfather of Grant Stevenson.

==Professional playing career==
===Detroit Red Wings===
After finishing his junior years playing for the Humboldt Indians and the Windsor Spitfires, he signed with the Detroit Red Wings in 1949. The first few years of his NHL career were spent playing in Detroit&#x27;s minor system. In the 1952 playoffs, he was called up from the minors to be the backup goalie in the finals but did not play for Detroit. Detroit still put Hall&#x27;s name on the Stanley Cup, before he had played his first NHL game. He finally made the Red Wings&#x27; lineup as their starting goalie in the 1955–56 season, displacing Terry Sawchuk. Hall played in every game of his first full season with the Red Wings, recording twelve shutouts, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, and being voted the Second Team All-Star goaltender. He seemed erratic during the Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal.

===Chicago Blackhawks ===

During his second full season with Detroit, he again played every game and was voted as the First Team All-Star goaltender, which since the Vezina Trophy was automatically awarded to the goaltenders on the team allowing the fewest goals, was essentially being named the best goaltender in the league. Despite this, at season&#x27;s end, he found himself traded to the Chicago Black Hawks along with NHL Players&#x27; Association co-organizer Ted Lindsay. Hall continued his stellar play in the Windy City, playing every regular-season game as well as every playoff game. In 1961, Hall backstopped the Black Hawks to their first Stanley Cup Championship since 1938 over Detroit. On November 7, 1962, the record streak finally came to an end against the Boston Bruins, as Hall had back problems. Denis DeJordy replaced him during the game. Hall managed to play 502 consecutive complete games, which spanned eight seasons, an NHL record for goaltenders that is unlikely to be broken. He never wore a goaltending mask or helmet during the streak, only doing so late in his career, which will be an unbreakable record as the mask has now become a mandatory piece of equipment. It is rumoured that Hall threw up before each game, then drank a glass of orange juice. During his time in Chicago, he was voted the First Team All-Star goaltender five times and the Second Team All-Star goaltender three times.

===Later success===
Despite winning the Vezina Trophy in 1966–67, the 36-year-old Hall was left unprotected for that summer&#x27;s NHL expansion draft and was chosen by the St. Louis Blues. One of six expansion franchises in their first year in the league, the Blues stocked themselves with veteran talent, including Red Berenson and Phil Goyette, and won the West Division Playoffs in two seven-game series. Hall&#x27;s play led them to the Stanley Cup Finals. Most hockey fans expected an utter rout when the established Canadiens faced the 1st-year expansion Blues. But this was Hall&#x27;s fourth trip to the finals, and his goaltending was the most outstanding contribution to the surprisingly good performance of the Blues against the Montreal Canadiens. The Blues lost the best-of-seven series getting swept 4–0, but in 4 exciting 1-goal games (3–2 (OT), 1–0. 4–3 (OT), and 3–2). Hall&#x27;s remarkable play was recognized by being awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs&#x27; Most Valuable Player, an award rarely going to a player from a losing team. ‘Even though we lost to the Canadiens in a sweep, I don’t feel it tainted my winning the Smythe one bit’, said Hall. ‘The odds were heavily stacked against us right from the start.’

In 1968, veteran goaltending legend Jacques Plante joined the Blues, sharing duties with Hall. The two put together a fine season in 1968–69, winning the Vezina Trophy, and setting a then-Blues&#x27; record of 13 shutouts. Hall was voted the First Team All-Star goaltender emblematic of being the best goaltender in the league, his record seventh selection as such.

===Retirement===

He had retired after the 1968–69 season, but Hall came out of retirement to play 18 games in 1969–70 season. He was in goal when the Boston Bruins&#x27; Bobby Orr scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal in game 4 of the 1970 Finals after only 40 seconds of overtime.

Hall&#x27;s career ended after the 1970–71 season when he announced his retirement at the age of 39. In 1975 he was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Hall won his third Stanley Cup as the goaltending coach with Calgary Flames in 1989.

==Legacy==

Hall ended his career with 407 wins, 84 shutouts, a career GAA of 2.49, and was voted to eleven All-Star Games. Hall is widely regarded as one of the first NHL goalies to master the butterfly style of goaltending. He is thought of by many as one of the best goalies to ever play the game. Hall still holds the record for the most First Team All-Star selections (7) which he achieved while playing in the same era as other greats, Sawchuk and Plante—as well as other Hall of Famers, such as Johnny Bower and Gump Worsley.

In 1998, he was ranked number 16 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, currently the highest rank for a living former goaltender (No. 13-ranked Jacques Plante died in 1986, and No. 9 Terry Sawchuk in 1970).

In 2005, the City of Humboldt, Saskatchewan erected a permanent monument to Hall&#x27;s career in Glenn Hall Park on Highway #5 (Glenn Hall Drive). The tribute included highlights of his career from his junior days in Humboldt until he retired from the NHL.

<text>Newsworld International (NWI) was an American news-oriented cable and satellite television network that operated from June 1994 to July 2005. The network carried a mix of newscasts from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other international networks. After several ownership changes, the channel was purchased by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and other parties in 2005 and became Current TV.

==History==
The network was launched on June 1, 1994, as a joint venture between the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Power Corporation of Canada along with sister channel Trio. It aired much of the same programming as the CBC-owned Canadian cable news channel CBC Newsworld. 

During the late 1990s, Newsworld International&#x27;s Sunday evening newscast at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time aired on CBC-owned CBET in Windsor, Ontario as a replacement for the ABC family movie anthology series &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, which aired on most other CBC stations in that timeslot (Windsor is part of the Detroit market for programming purposes, as such, stations in Southwestern Ontario near the U.S.–Canada border pre-empt certain U.S.-based programs whose rights are held by Canadian networks to avoid paying higher advertising rates).

The channel reached about 20 million homes and provided news coverage from a variety of global perspectives. It also acted as a news source for Canadians who reside or were visiting the United States, Latin America or the Caribbean. The channel was available across the United States mainly on satellite provider DirecTV.

In May 2000, Newsworld International was sold along with sister cable channel Trio to Barry Diller&#x27;s USA Network for $155 million. It was subsequently acquired by Vivendi (which later merged with Universal Pictures to become Vivendi Universal). The CBC maintained day-to-day operation of the channel. The network&#x27;s main in-house news program was &quot;NWI International NewsFirst&quot;.

===Shutdown and replacements===
In 2004, Newsworld International was purchased by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Joel Hyatt, who acquired it mainly for the channel&#x27;s digital cable and satellite coverage reach, and were not interested in maintaining the network&#x27;s existing format. Programming on Newsworld continued to be provided by the CBC until July 31, 2005; on that date, the network ceased operations with a special farewell message from the channel&#x27;s Toronto offices on behalf of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre.

Gore and Hyatt relaunched the channel at midnight on August 1 as Current TV, specializing in a youth perspective on national issues. Gore and Hyatt chose the format after deciding that a liberal-focused news network would be rejected by national advertisers. The new channel, despite being profitable, underwent a major reorganization in 2010 after a &quot;troubled&quot; history, eventually evolving it into a progressive-leaning news and documentary channel. Gore and his partners sold the network to Al Jazeera Media Network in 2013, which like Gore and Hyatt before them, was mainly interested in taking over the channel&#x27;s existing carriage deals, using Current&#x27;s channel space to launch the internationally focused news channel Al Jazeera America that August. Al Jazeera America in turn failed in April 2016, after which the channel space created by NWI in 1994 ceased to exist.

After the closure of the channel, the CBC began uploading some of its news programs and reports as clips on CBC.ca for online viewing worldwide. Today, CBC News Network – the former parent channel of Newsworld International – carries many of the CBC programs formerly seen on Newsworld, and is available worldwide outside of Canada online through paid subscriptions.

==Programming==
===Original series===
Newsworld International produced &quot;Special Assignment&quot;, a half-hour documentary series hosted by veteran CBC correspondent Bill Cunningham, featuring a different country in each episode. The format included a segment of historical context on the featured country with archive footage narrated by Cunningham, followed by a recap of recent political developments and current events. The program often featured interviews with high-ranking government officials and political insiders. During its run, &quot;Special Assignment&quot; visited many countries in Europe, East Asia and Latin America as well as countries in Africa and the Caribbean. Reruns of earlier editions often included updated narrations to reflect recent developments.

<text>Paxton Automotive is a United States–based manufacturer of superchargers for automotive use. The company is the major proponent of the centrifugal type supercharger. Early products were offered under the [[McCulloch Motors Corporation|McCulloch]] name. Some Paxton superchargers have been factory fitted, but most units sold have been aftermarket installed. Paxton products are possibly best known for their frequent use in performance-modified Ford Mustangs.

Inventor Robert Paxton McCulloch began producing superchargers to his design in 1937 for the Ford Flathead V8, a popular engine for performance modification at the time. The company estimates that around 5,000 were built before World War II stopped production.

Postwar, McCulloch developed a more sophisticated supercharger and began selling it in 1953. This was factory fitted to a number of vehicles at the time, including the Kaiser Manhattan, Packard Panther, Studebaker Golden Hawk, 
1957 Packard Clipper and 1958 Packard Hawk.

In 1956, McCulloch set up a separate Paxton Superchargers division, selling it off in 1958. Supercharged engines were used for one successful year in NASCAR racing, after which forced induction was banned from the sport. For this purpose, Paxton superchargers were fitted as the rare (211 produced) F-option for the 1957 Ford Thunderbird. 

A short run of Shelby Mustangs were fitted with Paxton superchargers, and Ford dealers offered Paxton superchargers as a dealer-fitted Ford Mustang option from 1965 to 1972. Paxton still provides supercharger kits for older Mustangs as well as more recent models.

Still in business as a subsidiary of Vortech, Paxton now supplies complete supercharging kits for popular performance-modified cars, as well as bare superchargers for more customised installations.

One of the more unusual applications for the Paxton brand superchargers was as an air pump in the air purifying CO2 scrubbers of U.S. Navy submarines.

<doc id="958612" wikidata="Q5068894" url="?curid=958612" title="Challenge Anneka">
<text>Challenge Anneka is a British entertainment reality programme that originally aired on BBC1 from 8 September 1989 to 15 October 1995 and is hosted by Anneka Rice.

It was announced on 6 November 2006 that the series was returning, but this time on ITV. The first of the two specials was shown on Boxing Day 2006. The second was transmitted 6 June 2007.

On 23 May 2022, Channel 5 announced that they had commissioned a revival of the series, with four episodes being ordered by the broadcaster. Two episodes were broadcast on 18 and 25 March 2023. The third episode was broadcast on 14 May 2023 and the fourth is yet to air.

==Format==

The series was devised as a vehicle for Anneka Rice, who had previously appeared on &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;, one of the first big hits for Channel 4 and was piloted in 1987&#x27;s edition of &quot;Children in Need&quot;. It was produced by Tom Gutteridge of Mentorn, who also produced the US version with Erin Brockovich.
The format of &quot;Challenge Anneka&quot; involved Rice being given a task to accomplish within a certain period, usually two or three days. She was supposed to have no knowledge of what the task of each particular episode would be before it began, and would have to organise its accomplishment by persuading companies and people to contribute their time and resources for free. The task would usually be in aid of a charitable cause, for example building a play area for children within the local community, or something similar.

Rice would be based during the &#x27;challenges&#x27; in a large blue truck, and for her frequent trips to persuade companies and people to take part she initially employed the use, in the first 3 series, of a Volkswagen based beach buggy, and then went on to use a kit built Dakar 4x4 vehicle from series 4-7. For the ITV Specials, a Jeep buggy was used. In Series 8, Rice had the use of both a beach and a 4x4 buggy. For series 6 and 7, she had a dog called Pedro. Series 7 differed from the previous six series with new variation of theme tune, logo and on alternating episodes, a format tweak involving small scale mini Challenges running alongside the main Challenge. She was also distinguished by her frequent use of her mobile phone to organise the projects, years before they became common everyday objects for people in Britain.

Another trademark aspect of the series would be the frequent on-screen presence of Rice&#x27;s soundman, Dave Chapman, part of the camera team who followed her around as she attempted to accomplish the challenges and who often found himself having to lend a helping hand.

Most of the popularity of the series came from the tension of whether Rice and her teams of volunteers would accomplish their tasks before the deadlines set. Sometimes they would fail, but usually on such occasions those who had agreed to help out would carry on the following day to complete the work.

The format was sold to many European countries, each with a different host. In the late 1990s, the show was produced by Mentorn in the United States as &quot;Challenge America&quot; (ABC), hosted by Erin Brockovich.

==ITV revival==
&quot;Challenge Anneka&quot; returned in 2006 with a &#x27;one-off&#x27; special on ITV, on Boxing Day and featured the team helping World Vision to rebuild a maternity clinic, a cricket pavilion and a children&#x27;s play centre in Sri Lanka after the 2004 Tsunami disaster.

There were plans for two more UK specials in 2007 – Rice walked on stage, along with television crew, during a McFly concert in Cambridge, and asked the band if they would record a single for charity – this formed part of the Challenge Anneka challenge recording an album to raise money for Children&#x27;s Hospices around the UK, broadcast on 6 June 2007 on ITV. The album, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was released on 4 June 2007. The two specials gained 3.34m (8pm, 26 December 2006) and 2.8m (9pm, 6 June 2007) viewers on ITV. A third special, reported in the press at the time of the revived format, was never completed, as ITV dropped their plans to revive the series in a frequent format.

Following ITV abandoning their plans of a full revival, in 2009 Rice approached the BBC about a proposed revival as part of &quot;Children in Need&quot; night (where the format of &quot;Challenge Anneka&quot; had first been tested in 1987) to mark the 20th anniversary of the series. The BBC did not proceed with the proposal, citing that the series was no longer in the public consciousness.

== Channel 5 revival ==
On 23 May 2022, it was announced that the series would be revived again, this time on Channel 5 for a four-part series. This was shot from September to November 2022: Dementia Village 27-30 Sep; Sprouts 19-21 Oct; Sea Cadets 2-5 Nov; Foal Farm 15-18 Nov. 

Episode 1 (Foal Farm) gained 1.25m viewers for the 90 minute programme on Saturday 18 March 2023 at 8.50pm, with the second episode losing more than half its viewing audience (0.66m) on Saturday 25 March 2023 at 8.30pm. This resulted in Channel 5 postponing the last two scheduled episodes. The penultimate episode was transmitted on Sunday 14 May 2023 at 7.30pm (0.52m) and the final one has yet to air.

<text>Douglas is a community on Douglas Island in southeastern Alaska, directly across the Gastineau Channel from downtown Juneau.

==History==
Douglas Island was originally a border of the Auke people’s and Taku people’s territory. It was not usually used for year-round settlement, but rather as a place to spend the summer, or at times a place for battles.

Some historical reports indicate an early settler to the area may be credited for the naming of Douglas Island.

In 1880 gold was discovered in Juneau, Alaska, across the narrow Gastineau Channel, drawing in all kinds of people looking to strike it rich. In 1881 two towns sprouted up on Douglas Island: Treadwell and Douglas. Treadwell was the community for the miners, with its own entertainment, pool, and bar. Douglas, too, had businesses popping up and soon had its own school and post office. A railroad and boardwalk connected the two towns. At this time the Treadwell power plant was large enough to power the entire Treadwell area, Douglas, and Juneau. The power plant continued to serve the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mine until the mine was shut down in 1944 by the War Department as non-essential to the war effort.

1887, Douglas Island Friends Mission School established to forcefully assimilate Indigenous Alaska Native peoples into Western European culture. 

1902, Douglas Island Friends Mission School Closed. This site later became a dairy farm 

In 1902, the city of Douglas was incorporated. The town sustained significant damage on March 9, 1911, when a fire started in the Douglas Grill. It took the Douglas, Treadwell, and Juneau fire departments working together to stop the entire town from being destroyed.

The towns of Douglas and Treadwell underwent changes after the 1917 cave-in of the Treadwell mine. While one section still operated until 1926, Treadwell shrank and Douglas became the town of Douglas Island.

Douglas continued to have its own dairy (Douglas Dairy, owned by Joe Kendler) until 1923 when it moved across the channel. At this time, there was a regular ferry between the towns of Juneau and Douglas.

On October 10, 1927, another great fire ripped through Downtown Douglas once again, demolishing part of the abandoned Treadwell Mine, the Downtown commercial district and the Native Village. 

In 1935, the Douglas Bridge was opened and made transportation between the island and Juneau simpler. 

On February 23, 1937, the city of Douglas again experienced a devastating fire, with 600 of the 700 residents losing their homes. However, Douglas rebuilt and restarted. 

On March 8, 1955, the city voted to combine schools with the city of Juneau, resulting in the construction of Juneau-Douglas High School, which continues to serve the area&#x27;s students.

May 1962, Douglas City Council burned the Tlingit Indian Village of Douglas, Anax̱ Ya Andagan Yé (Where Sunlight Touches First). 

In a controversial moment in 1970, voters in the cities of Douglas and Juneau, and of the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough, elected to unify their respective governments, forming the present-day City and Borough of Juneau.


==Demographics==

Douglas first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as &quot;Douglas City.&quot; Despite its name, it was still an unincorporated community. It appeared as Douglas in 1900 and formally incorporated in 1902. In 1970, voters in the city of Douglas and Juneau Division approved a merger with the city and borough of Juneau.

In 1890, Douglas was the 11th largest community in Alaska with 402 residents. Of those, 356 were White, 26 were Native, 17 were Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Native), 2 were Asian and 1 was Other.

In 1900, Douglas was the 7th largest community in Alaska with 825 residents. It did not report a racial breakdown.

In 1910, Douglas was the 3rd largest city in Alaska with 1,722 residents (exceeding neighboring Juneau, which was in 4th place with 1,644 residents and 6th placed Treadwell on the south border of Douglas with 1,222 residents). It reported 1,344 Whites, 346 Natives and 32 others. Had all three locales been unified as they are today, they would&#x27;ve been the most populous locale that year with 4,588 residents, exceeding Fairbanks (3,541) as the largest city.

In 1920, Douglas fell to 7th place (919); in 1930 it was at 11th (593); in 1940 it was at 18th (522); in 1950 it was at 20th (699); in 1960 it was at 23rd (1,042); and in 1970 it was at 29th (1,243).

==Infrastructure==
The only traditional school left in Douglas is Gastineau Elementary, operated by the Juneau School District, which serves all of Douglas Island&#x27;s elementary-aged students. The Douglas Public Library is part of the Juneau Public Library System. Douglas has a small commercial core with several restaurants and bars, a gas station and the Perseverance Theatre, Alaska&#x27;s only professional theater company. The town’s population has dropped over the years but recently is up to about 3,000 people, or close to ten percent of the City and Borough of Juneau’s population. Douglas gets its water and electricity from Juneau and has a mix of onsite and municipal (diverted to Juneau) wastewater treatment.

The Alaska Department of Corrections has its headquarters in Douglas.

<text>Ethel Campbell Louise Anderson (née Mason; 16 March 1883 – 4 August 1958) was an early twentieth century Australian poet, essayist, novelist and painter. She considered herself to be mainly a poet, but is now best appreciated for her witty and ironic stories. Anderson has been described as &quot;a high-profile author, artist, art commentator and emissary for modernism&quot;.

==Life==

Ethel Anderson was born in Lillington, a suburb of Leamington, in Warwickshire, England, of Australian born parents Cyrus Mason and Louise Campbell on 16 March 1883. Her family soon moved back to Australia and she grew up in Sydney and at her grandfather&#x27;s property, Rangamatty, near Picton, New South Wales. She was educated both at home and at Sydney Church of England Girls&#x27; Grammar School (now SCEGGS Darlinghurst).

On 8 October 1904 she married Brigadier-General Austin Thomas Anderson (1868–1949) in Ahmednagar, Bombay where she had accompanied him on his posting. In 1907 they had a daughter, Bethia.

At the beginning of World War I her husband was posted to France and Anderson moved to Cambridge, England, where she studied drawing at Downing College and exhibited some of her work.

While she was in England, from 1914 to 1924, Anderson joined the Cambridge Group and mixed with artists such as Sir William Rothenstein. She painted murals for English churches and founded the Young Worcestershire Arts and Crafts Club.

The Andersons later lived in Worcestershire, and on her husband&#x27;s retirement from the army in 1924 the family moved to Australia and lived at Turramurra, New South Wales. From 1927 Brigadier Anderson became secretary to several State Governors.

In Sydney she became an important supporter of modern art and the modernist painters Grace Cossington Smith, Dorrit Black, Roland Wakelin and Roy de Maistre, by writing about their work, holding exhibitions in her home, organising exhibitions in other venues and opening exhibitions. She wrote articles on modern art and artists in various Australian publications. An exhibition of Roland Wakelin&#x27;s work was held at her home. In 1930 she cleared her house of furniture to hold an exhibition of Wakelin&#x27;s paintings.

In Turramurra, Ethel Anderson founded the Turramurra Wall Painters Union in 1927. She was asked by the rector of St James&#x27; Church, Sydney to help decorate the Children&#x27;s Chapel and designed a mural scheme for it which was executed by her artists group in 1929.

On 16 March 1932, she opened the inaugural exhibition of the Modern Art Centre established by Dorrit Black in Margaret Street, Sydney, to teach and promote the Cubist ideas learned during Black&#x27;s study trip to France. Anderson also wrote about contemporary artists&#x27; work for magazines such as &quot;Art in Australia&quot; and &quot;Home&quot;, while her poetry and stories were published in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot;, the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. Her poetry was influenced by her knowledge of French literature and Modernist work, with considerable formal and metrical experimentation. Her poem &quot;The Song of Hagar&quot; was set to music by John Antill.

The death of her husband in 1949 meant that she had to support herself, which she did through her writing, serialising her first novel &quot;At Parramatta&quot; in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. She died on 4 August 1958 in Sydney.

<doc id="958627" wikidata="Q2896861" url="?curid=958627" title="Persuasive definition">
<text>A persuasive definition is a form of stipulative definition which purports to describe the true or commonly accepted meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an uncommon or altered use, usually to support an argument for some view, or to create or alter rights, duties or crimes.
The terms thus defined will often involve emotionally charged but imprecise notions, such as &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;terrorism&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot;, etc. In argumentation the use of a persuasive definition is sometimes called definist fallacy. (The latter sometimes more broadly refers to a fallacy of a definition based on improper identification of two distinct properties.)
Examples of persuasive definitions (definist fallacies) include: 
* Democrat – &quot;a leftist who desires to overtax the corporations and abolish freedom in the economic sphere&quot;.
* Democrat – &quot;compassionate person who cares about the poor and wants to make the rich pay their fair share.&quot;

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in controversial topics such as politics, sex, and religion, as participants in emotionally charged exchanges will sometimes become more concerned about swaying people to one side or another than expressing the unbiased facts. A persuasive definition of a term is favorable to one argument or unfavorable to the other argument, but is presented as if it were neutral and well-accepted, and the listener is expected to accept such a definition without question.

The term &quot;persuasive definition&quot; was introduced by philosopher Charles Stevenson as part of his emotive theory of meaning.

==Overview==
Language can simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings (expressive). Unlike other common types of definitions in logic, persuasive definitions focus on the expressive use of language to affect the feelings of readers and listeners ultimately with an aim to change their behavior. With this fundamentally different purpose, persuasive definitions are evaluated not on their truth or falsehood but rather on their effectiveness as a persuasive device. 
Stevenson showed how these two dimensions are combined when he investigated the terms he called &quot;ethical&quot; or emotive. He noted that some words, such as &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;war&quot;, are not simply used to describe reality by modifying the cognitive response of the interlocutor. They have also the power of directing the interlocutor&#x27;s attitudes and suggesting a course of action. For this reason, they evoke a different kind of reaction, emotive in nature. As Stevenson put it &quot;Instead of merely describing people&#x27;s interests, they change and intensify them. They recommend an interest in an object, rather than state that the interest already exists.&quot; These words have the tendency to encourage future actions, to lead the hearer towards a decision by affecting his or her system of interests. Stevenson distinguished between the use of a word (a stimulus) and its possible psychological effects on the addressee&#x27;s cognitive and the emotive reactions by labeling them as &quot;descriptive meaning&quot; and &quot;emotive meaning&quot;. Applying this distinction reveals how the redefinition of an ethical word is transformed into an instrument of persuasion, a tool for redirecting preferences and emotions:

In persuasive definitions the evaluative component associated with a concept is left unaltered while the descriptive meaning is modified. In this fashion, imprisonment can become &quot;true freedom&quot;, and massacres &quot;pacification&quot;. Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while keeping the original evaluations that the use of a word evokes. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the emotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define a word by qualifying the without setting forth what the term actually means. For instance, we can consider the following quasi-definition taken from Casanova&#x27;s Fuga dai Piombi. In this example (1), the speaker, Mr. Soradaci, tries to convince his interlocutor (Casanova) that being a &quot;sneak&quot; is an honorable behavior:

This quasi-definition employed in the first case underscores a fundamental dimension of the &quot;emotive&quot; meaning of a word, namely its relationship with the shared values, which are attacked as &quot;prejudices.&quot; This account given by the spy shows how describing the referent based on a different hierarchy of values can modify emotive meaning. The value of trust is not denied, but is placed in a hierarchy where the highest worth is given to the State.

Stevenson gives two definitions of the word &quot;culture&quot; in order to illustrate what a persuasive definition can accomplish:

* The original definition: &quot;widely read and acquainted with arts&quot;
* The persuasive definition: &quot;imaginative sensitivity&quot;

Both carry the positive emotive meaning of culture; it is still a good thing to be cultured by either definition. What they change is what exactly it means to be called &quot;cultured.&quot; Because being cultured is a positive trait, the society views being well read and acquainted with the arts as positive traits to have. By promoting a persuasive definition of &quot;imaginative sensitivity&quot; the society begins to views those qualities positively because they are attached to a word with a positive emotive meaning.

Unclear, figurative language is often used in persuasive definitions. Although several techniques can be used to form such a definition, the genus and difference technique is the usual one applied. Both definitions in the taxation example above agree that the genus is a procedure relating to governance but disagree on the difference. Persuasive definitions combine elements of stipulative definitions, lexical definitions, and sometimes theoretical definitions.

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in political speeches, editorials and other situations where the power to influence is most in demand. They have been dismissed as serving only to confuse readers and listeners without legitimate purpose. Critical scrutiny is often necessary to identify persuasive definitions in an argument as they are meant to appear as honest definitions.

<text>Louis Manuel McManus (May 31, 1898 – April 17, 1968) was an American television engineer, film editor, and designer of the 1930s and 1940s. He is best known as the designer for the appearance of the Emmy award statuette and symbol for the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.

During the 1930s, McManus worked primarily as an editor and edited many films and shorts, including those featuring Laurel and Hardy and the &quot;Our Gang&quot; characters. In addition to editing, he also designed the title cards for many films. 

It was his work as a designer that inspired him to submit a design entry for the Emmy award in 1948. He used his wife, Dorothy, as a model for the figure. His design was ultimately chosen for the award, out of a field of forty-eight other proposals submitted.

McManus was awarded an Emmy statue (in the &quot;Special Award&quot; category) in 1949 (the first year awards were presented) for his work in designing the Emmy.

<text>Thane is a neighborhood in the City and Borough of Juneau in the U.S. state of Alaska. Located along Gastineau Channel, it begins one mile (1.6 km) south of downtown Juneau and consists of approximately five dozen houses spread over five miles (8 km). All the houses are located on Thane Road, which comes to a dead end about six miles (10 km) from downtown; there are no side streets. It was named for Bartlett L. Thane, Manager and Director of the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company.

The only electric link to Snettisham hydroelectric dam - Juneau’s primary electric power plant - travels through Thane. Avalanches knock out this power line somewhat routinely, forcing the local power company, Alaska Electric Light &amp; Power, to keep a series of reserve diesel generators on standby.

==History==
Thane was founded in 1881 as a result of mining operations in the vicinity. Since World War II the population has steadily declined with the curtailment of mining activities. It is now a residential area (DeArmond, 1957, p43-44).

===Etymology===
The community was named in 1914 for Bartlett L. Thane, 1878–1927, general manager of the Alaska Gastineau Mining Co. which had its mill here. Thane was born in California and went to Alaska in 1897. The name Sheep Creek, which was the original miners&#x27; name for the town, was published by United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in the 1901 Coast Pilot, but was later changed to Thane by the United States Board on Geographic Names.

==Demographics==

Thane first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It continued to appear until the 1960 census. It was annexed into Juneau soon after.

==Geography==
Thane lies on the eastern shore of Gastineau Channel, southeast of Juneau and northwest of Point Salisbury, Coast Mountains.
==Government==

Juneau assesses personal property and real estate taxes, and distributes a portion of collections to settlements within the Borough. Tax rates are generally low.

==Media==
Radio and television broadcast are available either via satellite or from local broadcasts in Juneau, Alaska.

<text>Gastineau Channel (Lingít: &quot;Séet Ká&quot;) is a channel between the mainland of the U.S. state of Alaska and Douglas Island in the Alexander Archipelago of southeastern Alaska. It separates Juneau on the mainland side from Douglas (now part of Juneau), on Douglas Island. The first European to sight the channel was Joseph Whidbey whilst serving on the Royal Navy&#x27;s Vancouver Expedition early in August 1794, first from the south and later from the west. It was probably named for John Gastineau, an English civil engineer and surveyor.

==Characteristics==
The channel is navigable by large ships, only from the southeast, as far as the Douglas Bridge, approximately . Between the bridge and Juneau International Airport, approximately , it is navigable only by smaller craft and only at high tide.

The channel is becoming increasingly unnavigable due to shallow water depths. The two principal causes for this are:
# Isostatic rebound following the retreat of glacial ice sheets
# Sedimentation and infilling of the Gastineau Channel by silty sediment produced by the Mendenhall Glacier and Mendenhall River.
If current trends continue, Gastineau Channel may eventually become dry or unnavigable or both.

During isostatic rebound, the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere (crust) is slowly rising because of buoyant forces, following the removal of a large mass on the surface. This can be likened to an ice cube floating in a glass of water with a penny sitting on top. The weight of the penny makes the ice cube float lower, similar to the immense weight of a glacier on top of the lithosphere. When the penny (glacier) is removed, the ice cube (lithosphere) &quot;rebounds&quot; and floats slightly higher. In the geologic case, that scenario happens very slowly. Rates of isostatic rebound throughout SE Alaska vary from 0.1 to 1.5 inches/year depending on glacial history. The approximate rebound rate in the Juneau area is 0.25 to 0.5 inches/year.

<doc id="958648" wikidata="Q6535703" url="?curid=958648" title="Levitation (band)">
<text>Levitation were an English psychedelic rock band, formed in 1990 in London. The band consisted of frontman Terry Bickers (formerly guitarist with The House of Love), drummer David Francolini, guitarist Christian Hayes, bassist Laurence O&#x27;Keefe and keyboardist Robert White.

Bickers announced his departure from the band onstage at Tufnell Park Dome in north London on 14 May 1993. The release of the band&#x27;s already completed second album &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot; was shelved. The band enlisted former Some Have Fins frontman Steve Ludwin to replace Bickers, and in 1994 the new lineup released a remixed version of &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot; in Australia featuring new vocals from Ludwin. The band split in October 1994, leaving their second album remaining unreleased. Hayes, Francolini and O&#x27;Keefe regrouped in 1996 to form Dark Star. They released &quot;Twenty Twenty Sound&quot; in 1999 before disbanding in 2001.

== History ==

===Formation and early EPs===

Following his departure from The House Of Love in 1990, Terry Bickers began forming a new band with drummer David Francolini. The pair met during Bickers&#x27; last tour with his previous band in December 1989, on which Francolini was playing with support band Something Pretty Beautiful whom he joined just days before going out on tour. They first enlisted Christian Hayes, who had played with Ring and Panixphere, played bass in The Dave Howard Singers and was currently playing guitar in Cardiacs and working as a courier. Bickers knew Hayes through musical friends in South London, and when Bickers and Francolini spotted Hayes on his courier bike by chance in Covent Garden, London they arranged to meet up in the studio. Hayes&#x27; former Ring bandmate, keyboardist Robert White (also formerly of Zag and the Coloured Beads) soon joined along with bassist Joe Allen and violinist Johnny T, a member of The Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra.

The band first played low key shows in France supporting Ride, and in Belgium supporting Galaxie 500. Soon after Johnny T left the band along with Allen, who was replaced by former Jazz Butcher bassist Laurence O&#x27;Keefe, whom Francolini knew through touring with The Blue Aeroplanes. The band signed to the independent label Ultimate Records and released their debut release in April 1991, &quot;Nadine&quot;/&quot;Coppelia&quot; EP. It was made &quot;Single of the Week&quot; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, but received a negative review in the &quot;NME&quot;. Original bassist Joe Allen appeared on early recordings &quot;Nadine&quot; and &quot;Paid in Kind&quot;.

In August 1991 the band released the &quot;After Ever&quot; EP, which again made &quot;Single of the Week&quot; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, who described the EP as &quot;blessed genius&quot;. The following month, the band released the low-key single &quot;Squirrel&quot; (and early recording featuring the first lineup of the band) via the new Rough Trade mail-order 7&quot; vinyl singles club.

Through 1991 the band toured extensively, supporting the likes of Pere Ubu, All About Eve, the Psychedelic Furs and Hawkwind. The band were dropped from a tour supporting Transvision Vamp, officially because their equipment required too much stage space, but reports suggested that the headliners were worried about being overshadowed by Levitation who were receiving a lot of press due to Bickers&#x27; profile from his work with The House Of Love. The band also received further press attention from outlandish and eccentric comments Bickers would make to the press, which often displayed a fondness for conspiracy theories, leading him to be labelled &quot;Bonkers Bickers&quot;.

In November 1991 a compilation album, &quot;Coterie&quot;, was released collating tracks from the band&#x27;s previous releases along with new live recordings. The album was the first to be released in the US, via Capitol Records and saw the band play their first dates there in Los Angeles and New York.

===Rough Trade and &quot;Need for Not&quot;===

Following the release of &quot;Coterie&quot;, the band left Ultimate and signed to Rough Trade. They also signed to EMI in Germany and Festival Records in Australia, along with Capitol Records in North and South America. They released &quot;World Around&quot;, their first single for the label in February 1992 which reached the top five in the UK Indie Chart.

Leviation were kicked off another tour after just three gigs, supporting The Fall. The Fall&#x27;s frontman Mark E Smith reportedly took exception to the amount of time the band took to sound check and how much dry ice they used during their set. Smith allegedly called the band &quot;a bunch of fucking poofs&quot;.

The band released their debut album, &quot;Need for Not&quot; on 4 May 1992, and the slogan &quot;May the Fourth be with you&quot; was used in advertising. Throughout the summer the band toured with Cardiacs, and performed at Reading Festival. The band didn&#x27;t tour the album in the US as Bickers refused to go, with O&#x27;Keefe commenting that &quot;Terry was acutely paranoid of America and failed to join us in New York and started to be a real drag&quot;. He described the moment as &quot;the exact point at which the dynamic changed irreparably&quot;.

===Further recording and departure of Terry Bickers===

Following the collapse of Rough Trade, Levitation signed to Chrysalis, a sub-label that was owned by EMI Germany with whom the band were signed to there. The band began working on their second album, &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot;. After recording so much material towards it, the band decided it would be released in two parts, &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Autumn&quot;. Francolini revealed that the band &quot;started the album last year but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t finance the recording. But in the time we were looking around for the money we wrote a lot more material, which we have since recorded rather quickly&quot;. With the first part completed, the band released the lead single &quot;Even When Your Eyes Are Open&quot; in April 1993.

However, Bickers announced his departure from the band onstage at the Dome in Tufnell Park, London the following month on 14 May. He proclaimed from the stage that &quot;Levitation certainly are a lost cause as far as I can tell. We&#x27;ve completely lost it, haven&#x27;t we? Haven&#x27;t we?&quot;. The band had played Glasgow the previous night, and due to transportation problems had had no sleep. O&#x27;Keefe commented that &quot;obviously the demons within and the repressed emotions were released, along with all the other toys from the pram&quot;.

A mailout to the band&#x27;s fanclub featured a statement from Hayes, in which he described Bickers&#x27; departure as &quot;an unfortunate but necessary stick in the spokes... Terry no longer wishes to be in Levitation, feeling no excitement for the material and therefore uncomfortable within the band&quot;. The band maintained that his departure was positive for all involved. A later statement on 1 June read, &quot;Terry Bickers (the one who stood in the middle) has parted company with Levitation... We believe the circumstances in which we now find ourselves presents us with the oil to lubricate our gears&quot;.

Bickers would later admit that his mounting depression had much to do with the manner of his departure and added that &quot;it was a crap thing to do. It was unfair on the people that came to see us and on everyone in the band... The reason I left the way I did was because I didn&#x27;t want to give anyone the opportunity to talk me round.&quot; Hayes would also later admit, &quot;I think Terry could have definitely done with more support. He had begun a family and had pressures outside our creative bubble that were out of my experience. I&#x27;m afraid I was way too self-absorbed to appreciate the difficulty of the situation he was in&quot;.

The album was shelved and a string of shows were cancelled, including a headline slot at the Phoenix Festival, a support slot with The Cure on their Great Expectations gig at Finsbury Park and a US tour with Spiritualized, The Verve and Mercury Rev.

===The Steve Ludwin lineup, the reworked &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot; and the final split===

Determined to continue, Levitation set about auditioning new singers. Although it was rumoured that the band initially asked former All About Eve singer Julianne Regan, the band announced in August 1993 the arrival of American singer Steve Ludwin who had previously fronted the London-based band Some Have Fins. It was noted in the press that the band were seen as a quintessentially English band, and Hayes responded that he &quot;did personally have some reservations about us using an American vocal though, purely for sound reasons, and I do think that it does change the sound from how it was&quot;.

The new line-up played a series of gigs in Germany and at the Splash Club (at the Water Rats in King&#x27;s Cross) in May and June 1994. A subsequent letter to the fan club stated, &quot;The storm has passed and the voyage may begin again.&quot; The reception for the Ludwin fronted lineup however was mixed.

Instead of working on new material, the band decided to remix the existing &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot; album and overdub new vocals by Ludwin, removing most traces of Bickers. Hayes stated that the band &quot;really liked the material, we&#x27;d spent a year and a half to two years writing it all, and it seemed such a waste to just dump it&quot;. The new version received a low key release in Australia, along with a single release of &quot;King of Mice&quot; in Germany. The band were reportedly plagued by continuing and escalating rows (Francolini would later describe Ludwin as &quot;a vapid, careerist fool of a man and a complete waste of time&quot;), and it was announced in October 1994 that the band had finally split up.

==Post-split==

Immediately following his departure from the band, Bickers formed Paradise Estate with guitarist Clive Giblin. After Bickers&#x27; and Giblin&#x27; partnership dissolved, Bickers began working on material with his partner Caroline Tree and other musicians. They signed a development deal with Geoff Travis for Blanco y Negro Records and recorded an album which he would later describe as &quot;eclectic if also a little unfocused&quot;. The album was shelved and the band were dropped from the label before anything was released. Bickers and Tree began work on new material and were reunited with Clive Giblin in the band Cradle, who released the &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; album in 1996 on Ultimate Records. The band split yet again before the end of the year. In 1996, Bickers briefly resurfaced with the Brighton-based Monkey 7. In 2003, he reformed The House of Love with Guy Chadwick, who have since released two albums &quot;Days Run Away&quot; and &quot;She Paints Words In Red&quot;.

Christian Hayes, David Francolini and Laurence O&#x27;Keefe regrouped in 1996 to form Dark Star. They released a number of EPs and the 1999 album &quot;Twenty Twenty Sound&quot; on EMI. Despite recording a second album, &quot;out flew reason&quot;, in 2000, they split up in 2001 leaving the album unreleased until 2023 when it was made available on Bandcamp.

Post-Dark Star, O&#x27;Keefe embarked on a session career, while Hayes briefly played guitar in the Pet Shop Boys live band and subsequently released three solo albums of archive material under the name Mikrokosmos. Francolini re-surfaced in 2007 with a new band &quot;Dragons&quot; who released one album before splitting in 2009.

Robert White went on to front the Brighton-based The Milk And Honey Band. Several independent albums have been released and have worked with Andy Partridge&#x27;s APE label.

Steve Ludwin went on to form &quot;Pura Vida&quot;, who were originally set to feature Francolini on drums. The band released several EPs on Org Records and later evolved into Carrie, who released one album, &quot;Fear of Sound&quot; in 1998. In 2001, Ludwin formed Little Hell. Ludwin also unsuccessfully auditioned to be the lead singer for Velvet Revolver. Ludwin has since moved into songwriting and production and has worked with artists including Ash, Betty Curse, The Crimea and Good Shoes. He also produced the MTV Europe show &quot;Annoying Americans&quot;.

==Spin-offs and reissues==

Following the band&#x27;s split, several releases were announced for future release including &quot;The Barn Sessions&quot; (an instrumental album featuring Hayes, Francolini, O&#x27;Keefe &amp; White) and &quot;The Departure Lounge&quot; (a collaboration between Francolini &amp; White), along with mixing the second part of &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot; and releasing the complete album in its original form.

In 2007, Francolini confirmed plans for a Levitation re-issue campaign via Rough Trade (including the original, never released, version of &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot; along with an expanded edition of &quot;Need For Not&quot; and other unreleased material). However, it was later revealed that this didn&#x27;t happen after Rough Trade again went into liquidation, and Beggars Banquet Records who bought the label out didn&#x27;t wish to continue with the releases.

In January 2015, Hayes confirmed that &quot;Meanwhile Gardens&quot; would finally be released and it appeared on 23 October 2015.

<text>Michel Hénon (; 23 July 1931, Paris – 7 April 2013, Nice) was a French mathematician and astronomer. He worked for a long time at the Nice Observatory.

In astronomy, Hénon is well known for his contributions to stellar dynamics. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he made important contributions on the dynamical evolution of star clusters, in particular globular clusters. He developed a numerical technique using Monte Carlo methods to follow the dynamical evolution of a spherical star cluster much faster than the so-called &quot;n&quot;-body methods.

In mathematics, he is well known for the Hénon map, a simple discrete dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior.

He published a two-volume work on the restricted three-body problem.

In 1978 he was awarded the &quot;Prix Jean Ricard&quot;.

<doc id="958655" wikidata="Q723157" url="?curid=958655" title="Hogan Ephraim">
<text>Hogan Phillip Ephraim (born 31 March 1988) is an English former footballer. He is a graduate of the West Ham United academy, a former England Under-19 international, and made over 100 appearances for Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers. His primary position is winger, but he can also play forward.

==Background==

Ephraim was born on 31 March 1988 in Archway, London. He attended Highbury Grove School from 1999 to 2004 and lives in Highbury, North London.

==Club career==

===West Ham United===
Ephraim joined West Ham as a trainee in July 2004 making one substitute appearance for the Hammers first team during the 2005–06 season in the League Cup win over Sheffield Wednesday in September 2005 and was an unused substitute in the club&#x27;s 0–3 loss to Italian side Palermo in the 2nd leg of the UEFA Cup 1st round a year later. He joined Championship side Colchester United on a one-month loan in November 2006, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve played youth football for three years now and I&#x27;m looking forward to getting stuck into the Championship. A few clubs were interested but with Colchester being a team on the up, this was my first choice.&quot; He extended his loan spell for a further month in December and again in January 2007 until the end of the season. He made 21 appearances for Colchester, scoring one goal. In the 2007/08 season, he joined Queens Park Rangers on a three-month loan in August 2007. QPR manager John Gregory described him as &quot;...technically very gifted and has the versatility to play on the right or left of midfield.&quot;
He returned to West Ham in November 2007, having made 13 league appearances for QPR, scoring two goals.

===Queens Park Rangers===
He joined Queens Park Rangers for an undisclosed fee on 2 January 2008, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. Ephraim said of the move, &quot;It&#x27;s a great time to be at QPR. Big things are going to happen here – the new owners are very ambitious.&quot; Ephraim went on to become a regular during Queens Park Rangers&#x27; promotion campaign, scoring 3 goals during the 2010 to 2011 season. However, after QPR&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League, an influx of player&#x27;s saw Ephraim&#x27;s first team chances limited and he soon fell down the pecking order. He also scored four goals in a 13–0 pre-season friendly win over Tavistock. On 26 November 2009, Ephraim joined Football League One leaders Leeds United on loan until 1 January 2010. QPR decided to not allow Ephraim to be eligible for Leeds&#x27; FA Cup games. On 1 December, Ephraim made his Leeds debut in a 2–0 away win against Oldham Athletic. After being limited to substitute appearances against Huddersfield Town and Brentford, Ephraim returned to the starting line-up against Accrington Stanley, on 15 December, in the Football League Trophy and scored his first goal for Leeds as well as providing as assist for Neil Kilkenny&#x27;s goal. On 1 January 2010, he returned to QPR.

On 9 November 2011, Ephraim joined Football League One leaders Charlton Athletic on loan until 3 January 2012. Ephraim signed on loan for Bristol City on 22 March 2012 until the end of the 2011–12 season. Ephraim scored on his debut on 25 March in a 1–1 away draw with Middlesbrough. Ephraim signed with Toronto FC on loan on 27 February 2013. Ephraim made his debut for Toronto on 2 March in a 1–0 away defeat to Vancouver Whitecaps FC. On 4 June 2013 Ephraim&#x27;s loan was terminated by Toronto. On 8 November 2013, Ephraim joined Peterborough United on loan for a month. His Peterborough debut came the next day in a 2–0 home win in the FA Cup against Exeter City. Ephraim returned to QPR in February 2014, having made 11 appearances in all competitions for The Posh.

Ephraim was finally released by QPR on 1 July 2014.

===Wycombe Wanderers===
On 28 October 2014, Ephraim signed for League Two team, Wycombe Wanderers on a free transfer. On 1 November 2014, Ephraim made his debut appearance against Oxford United, as a second-half substitute in a 2–1 away league win. After appearing in the Football League Two play-off Wembley final for Wycombe Wanderers, Ephraim turned down the offer of a new contract with The Chairboys and subsequently left the club.

===Whitehawk===
After being without a club for the first half of the 2016–17 season, Ephraim eventually signed for Brighton-based National League South side Whitehawk in March 2017.

==International career==
Ephraim has represented England at U-16, U-17, U-18 and U-19 levels. He scored four goals in an England under-17s match against Russia and appeared in the UEFA European Championships in May 2005, scoring two goals in three games.

<text>The Durham Fair, held in Durham, Connecticut, is one of the largest agricultural fairs in New England and was first held in 1916. The four-day event takes place during the last full weekend of September. Activities include livestock and competitive exhibits, pulling contests, craft and commercial tents, various forms of entertainment and a carnival midway. The fairgrounds accommodate both permanent buildings for commercial and agricultural exhibits and space for tents and other non-permanent structures to be brought in each year. Past entertainers on the main stage have included Blake Shelton, Pat Benatar, Justin Moore, George Jones, SHeDAISY, Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn, 38 Special, Charlie Daniels, Phil Vassar, The Guess Who, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Blues Traveler, and KC and the Sunshine Band.

The Durham Fair is staffed entirely by volunteers; in fact, it is the second largest fair in North America without paid management or employees. In addition to the members of the Durham Agricultural Fair Association and other volunteers, local organizations such as schools, churches, clubs, civic groups, and more, participate in the fair to help raise funds for their organizations.

There was no fair in 1917–18, 1942–45 &amp; 2020.

== Pulling contests ==
Pulling contests are events that involve the use of oxen, draft horses and tractors to pull concrete weights to determine the best contestant in each event. They are well received as a show of strength between farmers who believe that their oxen, horses or tractors are the strongest in terms of pulling weight. Monetary awards provide additional motivation for all competitors.

== Use of Durham Fairgrounds ==
The Durham Fairgrounds have been used for several other festivals including B.O.M.B. Fest 2010.

In May 2012, the fairgrounds hosted the 1st annual Construction Pro RODEO featuring an EXPO, careers in construction day for high school kids and a skills competition.

<text>USS &quot;Tautog&quot; (SSN-639), a attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tautog (&quot;Tautoga onitis&quot;), a wrasse commonly found along the Northern Atlantic coast. The submarine was in service from 17 August 1968 to 31 March 1997.

== Construction and commissioning ==
The contract to build &quot;Tautog&quot; was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 30 November 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 27 January 1964. She was commissioned on 15 March 1967, sponsored by Pauline Lafon Gore, wife of United States Senator Albert Gore, Sr. (1907–1998) of Tennessee. Under sunny skies, a crowd of thousands watched as Mrs. Gore took a hearty swing with a bottle of champagne and intoned the memorial words, &quot;In the name of the United States of America, I christen thee &quot;Tautog&quot;.&quot; &quot;Tautog&quot; was commissioned 17 August 1968 under the command of Commander Buele G. Balderston.

== Service history ==

=== 1968–1970 ===
On 30 August 1968, &quot;Tautog&quot; departed Pascagoula on her way to join the United States Pacific Fleet. She transited the Panama Canal on 8 September 1968 and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 23 September 1968. There, she joined Submarine Squadron 12, serving as its flagship. Throughout 1969, &quot;Tautog&quot; completed her post-commissioning tests and sea trials, followed by her shakedown training cruise. She conducted the majority of these operations in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands, although in January and February 1969, she berthed in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, for trials and repairs. She completed her shakedown training in September 1969, and on 15 September 1969, began post-shakedown repairs and alterations, which were protracted by the necessity of replacing her entire diesel generator. &quot;Tautog&quot;″s repairs finally were completed on 19 February 1970, and she began normal operations out of Pearl Harbor, involving torpedo and sonar tracking exercises, culminating in &quot;Tautog&quot; earning the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; in 1970 for outstanding performance. &quot;Tautog&quot; received a Navy Unit Commendation for service on or about 1 June 1969. According to Drew, 2008, &quot;Tautog&quot; monitored a test of new cruise missiles launched from a Soviet &quot;Echo II&quot;-class submarine in the summer of 1969.

&quot;Tautog&quot; sailed with the Seventh Fleet (Western Pacific, or WESTPAC) in 1970, making port calls in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Okinawa, Japan, and Korea. Upon return to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Tautog&quot; was presented the Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations conducted during that deployment, 1 October 1970 to 1 April 1971.

=== Collision with &quot;K-108&quot;, 1970 ===
On 20 June 1970, &quot;Tautog&quot; was patrolling the North Pacific Ocean near the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, on the Soviet Union&#x27;s Kamchatka Peninsula, which was a major base for missile-armed submarines of the Soviet Navy. &quot;Tautog&quot; was attempting to trail the &quot;K-108&quot;, a Soviet Navy guided-missile submarine nicknamed &quot;Black Lila&quot;. The Soviet submarine was &quot;close aboard&quot; with &quot;Tautog&quot;, unaware that &quot;Tautog&quot; was in the vicinity, and the two submarines were within feet of one another for a lengthy period. Unable to determine the depth of &quot;K-108&quot;, as new depth-finding hydrophones had not yet been installed, the American submarine was at a disadvantage in such close quarters. At some points, the hydrographic equipment aboard &quot;Tautog&quot; registered zero distance between the submarines. At another point, &quot;Tautog&quot;″s hydrophone operators assumed &quot;K-108&quot; had risen to near the surface, placing the Soviet submarine directly above &quot;Tautog&quot;. Then, the operators determined the Soviet vessel was descending. The trace on the oscilloscope that gave the American submariners at visual reference as to the distance of &quot;K-108&quot; disappeared. Just as the captain began to say the Soviet sub was coming close aboard again, &quot;K-108&quot; slammed belly first into the top of &quot;Tautog&quot;″s sail, proof the Soviet vessel had been descending from directly above. The &quot;K-108&quot;″s massive screws came into contact with the steel of &quot;Tautog&quot;″s sail and lost one screw. This was confirmed by hydrographic sound of a turbine running away aboard the Soviet sub, being no longer coupled to a propeller. &quot;Tautog&quot; suffered damage to her sail. As &quot;Tautog&quot; proceeded away from the site of the incident, her crew heard what they believed was &quot;K-108&quot; breaking up and sinking. When &quot;Tautog&quot; arrived in Pearl Harbor, a large portion of one of &quot;K-108&quot;″s screws was found embedded in her sail. Over 20 years later, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, &quot;K-108&quot; was revealed to have actually been able to return to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The former captain of &quot;K-108&quot;, Boris Bogdasaryan, was able to provide a concise narrative of the collision, which resulted in no casualties aboard either submarine.

Though the occurrence of this event was adamantly denied by the United States and the Soviet Union, &quot;Tautog&quot;″s sail was permanently bent at a 2° angle, which made dry-docking problematic.

In 1991, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; broke the story about the collision. The Discovery Channel mentioned it in their TV program &quot;Sharks of Steel&quot;, and the full details were finally made public in 1999 in the book &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff: The Untold Story Of American Submarine Espionage&quot;.

=== 1970–1977 ===
On 9 October 1970, &quot;Tautog&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her first East Asian deployment. She arrived on station at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 23 October 1970 and joined the United States Seventh Fleet. During her tour of duty in the Western Pacific, she was completely engaged in antisubmarine warfare training, usually with units of the Seventh Fleet, but on one occasion, in a joint operation with the British Royal Navy frigate HMS &quot;Aurora&quot; (F10). She spent time in port for liberty and repairs at such places as U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in the Philippines; Hong Kong; Yokosuka, Japan; and the South Korean port of Pusan. She concluded her first tour of duty in the Western Pacific on 28 March 1971, when she departed Yokosuka bound for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 5 April 1971 and resumed her routine of upkeep in port alternated with periods at sea engaged in antisubmarine warfare training for the remainder of 1971 and during the first three months of 1972.

On 21 March 1972, &quot;Tautog&quot; put to sea for a special operation. During that mission, she called briefly at Guam and at Subic Bay. At the conclusion of the assignment, &quot;Tautog&quot; earned the Navy Unit Commendation for operations conducted during that deployment, 1 June 1972. &quot;Tautog&quot; made a liberty visit to Hong Kong before returning via Guam to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 31 August 1972. She conducted operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the remainder of 1972.

On 15 January 1973, &quot;Tautog&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her first regular overhaul. It was completed on 15 April 1974, when she resumed local operations out of Pearl Harbor which – except for a voyage to the Pacific Northwest which lasted from late July to early September 1974 – occupied her time until the beginning of May 1975. 
On 3 May 1975, she departed Pearl Harbor for another series of special operations in the Central and Western Pacific. That voyage included a period in drydock at Guam during the first week in June 1975, and exercises in the Philippines near Subic Bay. Ports of call once again included Subic Bay and Hong Kong, but no South Korean or Japanese ports. &quot;Tautog&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 October 1975 and resumed her schedule of training and upkeep. The officers and crew were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for the successful completion of their assigned mission.

=== 1977–1980 ===
Attack submarine training, independent ship&#x27;s exercises, inspections, and evaluations, all conducted in the Hawaiian Islands operating area, consumed &quot;Tautog&quot;″s energies through the end of 1976. She did not deploy overseas again until the beginning of 1977, when she got underway for a goodwill visit to Mombasa, Kenya. Departing Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1977, she reached Mombasa on 24 January 1977 and remained there for a month while her crew saw the sights and she received visitors on board.

==== Uganda crisis, 1977 ====
&quot;Tautog&quot; departed Mombasa on 24 February 1977 and started east toward Pearl Harbor. On the way, however, President of Uganda Idi Amin had precipitated a crisis by rounding up all Americans resident in Uganda in response to President of the United States Jimmy Carter&#x27;s condemnation of the murders of two of Amin&#x27;s Ugandan political opponents, and &quot;Tautog&quot; received orders to join a hastily organized task force built around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and return to the East African coast. While the United States waited for Amin to make his mind up about whether or not to release the American hostages, &quot;Tautog&quot; cruised the coast of Kenya, which stands between landlocked Uganda and the Indian Ocean, with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force both as a show of American resolve to protect U.S. citizens in Uganda and as a scratch force to try for a hostage rescue if one became necessary. &quot;Tautog&quot; received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service 1 November 1976 to 5 July 1977.

Amin eventually freed the hostages, and &quot;Tautog&quot; was released from the special task force and resumed her voyage east, arriving at Guam on 19 March 1977. &quot;Tautog&quot; visited Chinhae, South Korea, in April, and on 20 April 1977, arrived in Subic Bay for a series of special operations in the Philippines.

Early in May 1977, &quot;Tautog&quot; made a liberty call at Hong Kong and then returned to Subic Bay on the 18 May. Special operations occupied her time in late May and June. On 3 July 1977, she arrived back at Pearl Harbor and upon return, preparations were made for the transit to Vallejo, California, where &quot;Tautog&quot; would undergo its second major overhaul and receive a new reactor core. In December 1977, she entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard and the overhaul commenced.

Following completion of the stand down on 8 August 1977, &quot;Tautog&quot; conducted local operations in the Hawaiian area until she departed Pearl Harbor on 2 December 1977 to proceed to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, for an overhaul. This overhaul, which included the refueling of her nuclear core, lasted nearly 15 months, after which &quot;Tautog&quot; successfully completed her sea trials and sailed to Pearl Harbor to rejoin the submarine force arriving in July 1979.

=== 1980–1997 ===

Following a period of training and operational exercises, &quot;Tautog&quot; again deployed on WESTPAC in March 1980. &quot;Tautog&quot; met every commitment placed on her during this period of international tension, and was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for her performance. In September 1980, the ship was awarded the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;, Antisubmarine Warfare &quot;A&quot; and Engineering &quot;E&quot; for excellence displayed during the previous year. Port visits were made to Diego Garcia; the Philippines; Perth, Australia; and Guam. &quot;Tautog&quot; also received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service on or around 1 June 1980.

In 1981, the ship and crew were rested and ready to go. After a training cycle, &quot;Tautog&quot; sailed west once more in support of the Seventh Fleet in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. She became the first nuclear submarine to transit the Malacca Straits; she surfaced and visited Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Diego Garcia, and Japan. Later in 1982, &quot;Tautog&quot; earned her third consecutive Engineering &quot;E&quot; and a Damage Control &quot;DC&quot; for excellence in engineering and damage control.

In winter 1982, &quot;Tautog&quot; joined one of her sister ships, , and journeyed to the frozen reaches of the Arctic. She operated beneath the ice pack for two months and conducted a dual surfacing maneuver at the North Pole with USS &quot;Aspro&quot;. It was reportedly the second rendezvous by two U.S. submarines at the pole and the first during winter.

During summer 1983, &quot;Tautog&quot; once again found herself operating under the Arctic ice pack. To celebrate her arrival at the Pole, the crew had a picnic, a tug-of-war, and dog-sled races &quot;around the world&quot;.

In 1984, following a two-month shipyard availability, &quot;Tautog&quot; entered an operational crew training period. In the spring of 1984, &quot;Tautog&quot; again journeyed west in support of Seventh Fleet operations. &quot;Tautog&quot; operated extensively in the Northern Pacific, making port visits to the Philippines, Thailand, and Japan. Again, she was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal. &quot;Tautog&quot; completed a Western Pacific deployment in November 1984 upon her return to Pearl Harbor. After completing a stand down and a post-deployment upkeep period, she hosted prospective commanding officer operations in February 1985 and spent a three-day liberty period at Lahaina, Hawaii, on Maui.

In the summer of 1985, &quot;Tautog&quot; joined the attack submarine in hosting prospective commanding officer operations. In October 1985, &quot;Tautog&quot; left Pearl Harbor for a Western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment, visiting Guam; Singapore (for Christmas); Diego Garcia twice; Perth, Australia; the Philippines; and Chinhae, South Korea. On her return to Pearl Harbor, she picked up an operational reactor safeguard examination team.

Once back in Pearl Harbor in April 1986, &quot;Tautog&quot; had a change of command ceremony in which Commander Walter P. Stuermann relieved Commander T. R. Kent as commanding officer. In October 1986, &quot;Tautog&quot; began a nonrefueling overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. After extensive modifications and testing, she returned to her homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 30 May 1989.

&quot;Tautog&quot; departed on her eighth Western Pacific deployment in May 1990, visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, Subic Bay (Philippines), and Yokosuka, Japan. The ship experienced a massive typhoon, which prevented her from entering Subic Bay for almost a week. Back in Pearl Harbor in November 1990, &quot;Tautog&quot; enjoyed the holidays and began preparing for her third Arctic deployment. In April 1991, &quot;Tautog&quot; once again joined her sister ship, &quot;Aspro&quot;, for three weeks of Arctic under-ice operations, ending in a liberty port in San Francisco. After the exercise, she performed an emergency main ballast tank blow from her test depth. In summer 1991, &quot;Tautog&quot; hosted the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) submarine &quot;Akishio&quot; on her mid-Pac cruise.
In late January 1992, &quot;Tautog&quot; successfully fired a MK 48 Advanced Capability warshot torpedo and sank the target ship ex-&quot;Darter&quot; in the deep waters just south of Oahu. In summer 1992, &quot;Tautog&quot; set sail on a WESTPAC deployment, where she pulled back-to-back operations totaling about 150 days at sea of the roughly 180-day deployment.

In October 1993, &quot;Tautog&quot; was sent on an emergent WESTPAC with four days&#x27; notice. The ship and crew participated in a joint exercise with the JMSDF, then enjoyed a liberty port in Hong Kong. In February 1995, she departed Pearl Harbor for her 11th WESTPAC deployment, conducting joint operations with Japanese, Korean, and British naval forces. During this deployment, the crew was still able to enjoy such liberty ports as Guam, Hong Kong, Yokosuka (Japan), Sasebo (Japan), Okinawa (Japan), Chinhae (South Korea), and Subic Bay (Philippines). &quot;Tautog&quot; was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for the highly completion of this successful cruise.

Misfortune arrived in February 1996 while the &quot;Tautog&quot; was conducting a personnel transfer in the mouth of Pearl Harbor. Unusual winds blowing from Maui caught the sail and &quot;Tautog&quot; drifted off course. While the officer of the deck was trying to reposition her, she ran into the west bank of the harbor. The damage was slight – cracking the sonar dome – but it was still a ship-grounding incident and a board of inquiry was launched to determine the root cause of the incident.

In July 1996, &quot;Tautog&quot; departed on her final deployment, this time to the eastern Pacific, supporting weapons testing and weeks of daily midshipman orientation cruises. Her liberty ports included San Diego and Esquimalt (British Columbia), with a repair stop in Bangor, Washington. &quot;Tautog&quot; made her 1,119th and last dive on 13 October 1996; her inactivation ceremony was held on 25 October 1996. After an inactivation period around 6 months, &quot;Tautog&quot; departed her lifelong homeport of Pearl Harbor for the final time, en route to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for final disposition.

== Decommissioning and disposal ==

&quot;Tautog&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 1997 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton began on 15 March 2003 and was completed on 30 November 2004.

== Commemoration ==
&quot;Tautog&quot;″s sail was preserved and is now on display at Galveston Naval Museum, in Seawolf Park in Galveston, Texas. ). It suffered damage when Hurricane Ike struck the area in 2008.

<text>An aircraft catapult is a device used to help fixed-wing aircraft gain enough airspeed and lift for takeoff from a limited distance, typically from the deck of a ship. They are usually used on aircraft carrier flight decks as a form of assisted takeoff, but can also be installed on land-based runways, although this is rare.

The catapult used on aircraft carriers consists of a track or slot built into the flight deck, below which is a large piston or &quot;shuttle&quot; that is attached through the track to the nose gear of the aircraft, or in some cases a wire rope, called a catapult bridle, is attached to the aircraft and the catapult shuttle. Other forms have been used historically, such as mounting a launching cart holding a seaplane on a long girder-built structure mounted on the deck of a warship or merchant ship, but most catapults share a similar sliding track concept.

Different means have been used to propel the catapult, such as weight and derrick, gunpowder, flywheel, compressed air, hydraulic, steam power, and solid fuel rocket boosters. The United States Navy is developing the use of a linear motor-based electromagnetic catapult system called the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) with the construction of the s, and a similar system has also been developed for the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy&#x27;s Type 003 aircraft carrier.

Historically it was most common for seaplanes to be catapulted, allowing them to land on the water near the vessel and be hoisted on board, although in the Second World War (before the advent of the escort carrier) conventional fighter aircraft (notably the Hawker Hurricane) would sometimes be catapulted from &quot;catapult-equipped merchant&quot; (CAM) vessels to drive off enemy aircraft, forcing the pilot either to divert to a land-based airstrip, or to jump out by parachute or ditch in the water near the convoy and wait for rescue.

==History==

===First recorded flight using a catapult===
Aviation pioneer and Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Langley used a spring-operated catapult to launch his successful flying models and his failed Aerodrome of 1903. Likewise the Wright Brothers beginning in 1904 used a weight and derrick styled catapult to assist their early aircraft with a takeoff in a limited distance.

On 31 July 1912, Theodore Gordon Ellyson became the first person to be launched from a U.S. Navy catapult system. The Navy had been perfecting a compressed-air catapult system and mounted it on the Santee Dock in Annapolis, Maryland. The first attempt nearly killed Lieutenant Ellyson when the plane left the ramp with its nose pointing upward and it caught a crosswind, pushing the plane into the water. Ellyson was able to escape from the wreckage unhurt. On 12 November 1912, Lt. Ellyson made history as the Navy&#x27;s first successful catapult launch, from a stationary coal barge. On 5 November 1915, Lieutenant Commander Henry C. Mustin made the first catapult launch from a ship underway.

===Application timeline===

===Interwar and World War II===

The US Navy experimented with other power sources and models, including catapults that utilized gunpowder and flywheel variations. On 14 December 1924, a Martin MO-1 observation plane flown by Lt. L. C. Hayden was launched from using a catapult powered by gunpowder. Following this launch, this method was used aboard both cruisers and battleships.

By 1929, the German ocean liners &quot;SS Bremen&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot; had been fitted with compressed-air catapults designed by the Heinkel aviation firm of Rostock, with further work with catapult air mail across the South Atlantic Ocean, being undertaken during the first half of the 1930s, with Dornier &quot;Wal&quot; twin-engined flying boats.

Up to and during World War II, most catapults on aircraft carriers were hydraulic. United States Navy catapults on surface warships, however, were operated with explosive charges similar to those used for guns. Some carriers were completed before and during World War II with catapults on the hangar deck that fired athwartships, but they were unpopular because of their short run, low clearance of the hangar decks, inability to add the ship&#x27;s forward speed to the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed for takeoff, and lower clearance from the water (conditions which afforded pilots far less margin for error in the first moments of flight). They were mostly used for experimental purposes, and their use was entirely discontinued during the latter half of the war.

Many naval vessels apart from aircraft carriers carried float planes, seaplanes or amphibians for reconnaissance and spotting. They were catapult-launched and landed on the sea alongside for recovery by crane. Additionally, the concept of submarine aircraft carriers was developed by multiple nations during the interwar period, and through until WW2 and beyond, wherein a submarine would launch a small number of floatplanes for offensive operations or artillery spotting, to be recovered by the submarine once the aircraft has landed. The first launch off a Royal Navy battlecruiser was from on 8 March 1918. Subsequently, many Royal Navy ships carried a catapult and from one to four aircraft; battleships or battlecruisers like carried four aircraft and carried two, while smaller warships like the cruiser carried one. The aircraft carried were the Fairey Seafox or Supermarine Walrus. Some like did not use a catapult, and the aircraft was lowered onto the sea for takeoff. Some had their aircraft and catapult removed during World War II e.g. , or before ().

During World War II a number of ships were fitted with rocket-driven catapults, first the fighter catapult ships of the Royal Navy, then armed merchantmen known as CAM ships from &quot;catapult armed merchantmen&quot;. These were used for convoy escort duties to drive off enemy reconnaissance bombers. CAM ships carried a Hawker Sea Hurricane 1A, dubbed a &quot;Hurricat&quot; or &quot;Catafighter&quot;, and the pilot bailed out unless he could fly to land.

While imprisoned in Colditz Castle during the war, British prisoners of war planned an escape attempt using a falling bathtub full of heavy rocks and stones as the motive power for a catapult to be used for launching the Colditz Cock glider from the roof of the castle.

Ground-launched V-1s were typically propelled up an inclined launch ramp by an apparatus known as a &quot;Dampferzeuger&quot; (&quot;steam generator&quot;).

===Steam catapult===

Following World War II, the Royal Navy was developing a new catapult system for their fleet of carriers. Commander C. C. Mitchell, RNV, recommended a steam-based system using a slotted cylinder as an effective and efficient means to launch the next generation of naval aircraft. Trials on , flown by pilots such as Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown, from 1950 showed its effectiveness. Navies introduced steam catapults, capable of launching the heavier jet fighters, in the mid-1950s. Powder-driven catapults were also contemplated, and would have been powerful enough, but would also have introduced far greater stresses on the airframes and might have been unsuitable for long use.

At launch, a release bar holds the aircraft in place as steam pressure builds up, then breaks (or &quot;releases&quot;; older models used a pin that sheared), freeing the piston to pull the aircraft along the deck at high speed. Within about two to four seconds, aircraft velocity by the action of the catapult plus apparent wind speed (ship&#x27;s speed plus or minus &quot;natural&quot; wind) is sufficient to allow an aircraft to fly away, even after losing one engine.

Nations that have retained large aircraft carriers, i.e., the United States Navy and the French Navy, are still using a CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery) configuration. U.S. Navy tactical aircraft use catapults to launch with a heavier warload than would otherwise be possible. Larger planes, such as the E-2 Hawkeye and S-3 Viking, require a catapult shot, since their thrust-to-weight ratio is too low for a conventional rolling takeoff on a carrier deck.

====Steam catapults types====
Types previously or still operated by the British, U.S. and French navies include:

====Bridle catchers====
The protruding angled ramps (Van Velm Bridle Arresters or horns) at the catapult ends on some aircraft carriers were used to catch the bridles (connectors between the catapult shuttle and aircraft fuselage) for reuse. There were small ropes that would attach the bridle to the shuttle, which continued down the angled horn to pull the bridle down and away from the aircraft to keep it from damaging the underbelly. The bridle would then be caught by nets aside the horn. Bridles have not been used on U.S. aircraft since the end of the Cold War, and all U.S. Navy carriers commissioned since then have not had the ramps. The last U.S. carrier commissioned with a bridle catcher was USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;; starting with USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; the ramps were omitted. During Refueling and Complex Overhaul refits in the late 1990s–early 2000s, the bridle catchers were removed from the first three s. USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the last U.S. Navy operational carrier with the ramps still attached before her inactivation in 2012.

Like her American counterparts, the French aircraft carrier &quot;Charles De Gaulle&quot; is not equipped with bridle catchers because the modern aircraft operated on board use the same launch systems as in US Navy. Because of this mutual interoperability, American aircraft are also capable of being catapulted from and landing on &quot;Charles De Gaulle&quot;, and conversely, French naval aircraft can use the US Navy carriers&#x27; catapults. At the time when the Super Étendard was operated on board of the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, its bridles were used only once, as they were never recovered by bridle catchers.

The carriers and were also equipped with bridle catchers, not for the Super Étendards but only to catch and recover the Vought F-8 Crusader&#x27;s bridles.

=== Electromagnetic catapult ===
The size and manpower requirements of steam catapults place limits on their capabilities. A newer approach is the electromagnetic catapult, such as Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) developed by General Atomics. Electromagnetic catapults place less stress on the aircraft and offer more control during the launch by allowing gradual and continual acceleration. Electromagnetic catapults are also expected to require significantly less maintenance through the use of solid state components.

Linear induction motors have been experimented with before, such as Westinghouse&#x27;s Electropult system in 1945. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, navies again started experimenting with catapults powered by linear induction motors and electromagnets. Electromagnetic catapult would be more energy efficient on nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and would alleviate some of the dangers posed by using pressurized steam. On gas-turbine powered ships, an electromagnetic catapult would eliminate the need for a separate steam boiler for generating catapult steam. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s s and PLA Navy&#x27;s Type 003 aircraft carrier included electromagnetic catapults in their design.

==Civilian use==
From 1929, the German Norddeutscher Lloyd-liners and were fitted with compressed air-driven catapults designed by the &quot;Heinkel Flugzeugwerke&quot; to launch mail-planes. These ships served the route between Germany and the United States. The aircraft, carrying mail–bags, would be launched as a mail tender while the ship was still many hundreds of miles from its destination, thus speeding mail delivery by about a day. Initially, Heinkel He 12 aircraft were used before they were replaced by Junkers Ju 46, which were in turn replaced by the Vought V-85G.

German airline Lufthansa subsequently used dedicated catapult ships , , &quot;Ostmark&quot; and &quot;Friesenland&quot; to launch larger Dornier Do J &quot;Wal&quot; (whale), Dornier Do 18 and Dornier Do 26 flying boats on the South Atlantic airmail service from Stuttgart, Germany to Natal, Brazil. On route proving flights in 1933, and a scheduled service beginning in February 1934, &quot;Wals&quot; flew the trans-ocean stage of the route, between Bathurst, the Gambia in West Africa and Fernando de Noronha, an island group off South America. At first, there was a refueling stop in mid-ocean. The flying boat would land on the open sea, be winched aboard by a crane, refueled, and then launched by catapult back into the air. However, landing on the big ocean swells tended to damage the hull of the flying boats. From September 1934, &quot;Lufthansa&quot; had a support ship at each end of the trans-ocean stage, providing radio navigation signals and catapult launchings after carrying aircraft out to sea overnight. From April 1935 the &quot;Wals&quot; were launched directly offshore, and flew the entire distance across the ocean. This was possible as the flying boats could carry more fuel when they did not have to take off from the water under their own power, and cut the time it took for mail to get from Germany to Brazil from four days down to three.

From 1936 to 1938, tests including the Blohm &amp; Voss Ha 139 flying boat were conducted on the North Atlantic route to New York. &quot;Schwabenland&quot; was also used in an Antarctic expedition in 1938/39 with the main purpose of finding an area for a German whaling station, in which catapult-launched &quot;Wals&quot; surveyed a territory subsequently claimed by Germany as New Swabia. All of &quot;Lufthansa&quot; catapult ships were taken over by the Luftwaffe in 1939 and used as seaplane tenders in World War II along with three catapult ships built for the military.

After World War II, Supermarine Walrus amphibian aircraft were also briefly operated by a British whaling company, United Whalers. Operating in the Antarctic, they were launched from the factory ship FF &quot;Balaena&quot;, which had been equipped with an ex-navy aircraft catapult.

==Alternatives to catapults==
The Chinese, Indian, and Russian navies operate conventional aircraft from &quot;short take-off but arrested landing&quot; (STOBAR) aircraft carriers. Instead of a catapult, they use a ski jump to assist aircraft in taking off with a positive rate of climb. Carrier aircraft such as the J-15, Mig-29K, and Su-33 rely on their own engines to accelerate to flight speed. As a result, they must take off with a reduced load of fuel and armaments.

All other navies with aircraft carriers operate short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, such as the B variant of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, the BAE Sea Harrier, and the AV-8B Harrier II. These aircraft can take off vertically with a light load, or use a ski jump to assist a rolling takeoff with a heavy load. STOVL carriers are less expensive and generally smaller in size compared to CATOBAR carriers. The British &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers were built to use STOVL aircraft due to the expected cost of an electromagnetic catapult; they do not have the means to generate steam for a conventional catapult.

<text>Yōko Tawada (多和田葉子 &quot;Tawada Yōko&quot;, born March 23, 1960) is a Japanese writer currently living in Berlin, Germany. She writes in both Japanese and German. She is a former writer-in-residence at MIT and Stanford University.

Tawada has won numerous literary awards, including the Akutagawa Prize, the Tanizaki Prize, the Noma Literary Prize, the Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature, the Gunzo Prize for New Writers, the Goethe Medal, the Kleist Prize, and a National Book Award.

==Early life and education==

Tawada was born in Nakano, Tokyo. Her father was a translator and bookseller. She attended Tokyo Metropolitan Tachikawa High School. In 1979, at the age of 19, Tawada took the Trans-Siberian Railway to visit Germany. She received her undergraduate education at Waseda University in 1982 with a major in Russian literature, and upon graduation moved to Hamburg, Germany, where she started working with one of her father&#x27;s business partners in a book distribution business. She left the business to study at Hamburg University, and in 1990 she received a master&#x27;s degree in contemporary German literature. In 2000 she received her doctorate in German literature from the University of Zurich, where Sigrid Weigel, her thesis advisor, had been appointed to the faculty. In 2006 Tawada moved to Berlin, where she currently resides.

==Career==
Tawada&#x27;s writing career began in 1987 with the publication of &quot;Nur da wo du bist da ist nichts—Anata no iru tokoro dake nani mo nai&quot; (&quot;Nothing Only Where You Are&quot;), a collection of poems released in a German and Japanese bilingual edition. Her first novella, titled &quot;Kakato o nakushite&quot; (&quot;Missing Heels&quot;), received the Gunzo Prize for New Writers in 1991.

In 1993 Tawada won the Akutagawa Prize for her novella &quot;Inu muko iri&quot;, which was published later that year with &quot;Kakato o nakushite&quot; and another story in the single volume &quot;Inu muko iri&quot;. &quot;Arufabetto no kizuguchi&quot; also appeared in book form in 1993, and Tawada received her first major recognition outside of Japan by winning the Lessing Prize Scholarship. An English edition of the three-story collection &quot;Inu muko iri&quot;, translated by Margaret Mitsutani, was published in 1998 but was not commercially successful. New Directions Publishing reissued the Mitsutani translation of the single Akutagawa Prize-winning novella in 2012 under the title &quot;The Bridegroom Was a Dog.&quot; 

Several other books followed, including &quot;Seijo densetsu&quot; (&quot;Legend of a Saint&quot;) in 1996 and &quot;Futakuchi otoko&quot; (&quot;The Man With Two Mouths&quot;) in 1998. Portions of these books were translated into English by Margaret Mitsutani and collected in a 2009 book titled &quot;Facing the Bridge&quot;. Tawada won the 1996 Adelbert von Chamisso Prize, a German literary award for non-native speakers of German. In 1997 she was writer in residence at Villa Aurora, and in 1999 she spent four months as the Max Kade Foundation Distinguished Writer-in-Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She won the Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature for her 2000 book &quot;Hinagiku no ocha no baai&quot;, and both the Sei Ito Literature Prize and the Tanizaki Prize in 2003 for &quot;Yogisha no yako ressha&quot; (&quot;Suspects on the Night Train&quot;). 

Tawada took a bilingual approach to her 2004 novel &quot;Das nackte Auge&quot;, writing first in German, then in Japanese, and finally producing separate German and Japanese manuscripts. The novel follows a Vietnamese girl who was kidnapped at a young age while in Germany for a youth conference. An English version, translated from the German manuscript by Susan Bernofsky, was published by New Directions Publishing in 2009 under the title &quot;The Naked Eye&quot;. In 2005, Tawada won the prestigious Goethe Medal from the Goethe-Institut for meritorious contributions to German culture by a non-German. From January to February 2009, she was the Writer-in-Residence at the Stanford University Department of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages.

In 2011, inspired by the story of the orphaned polar bear Knut, Tawada wrote three interlocking short stories exploring the relationship between humans and animals from the perspective of three generations of captive polar bears. As with previous work, she wrote separate manuscripts in Japanese and German. In 2011 the Japanese version, titled &quot;Yuki no renshūsei&quot;, was published in Japan. It won the 2011 Noma Literary Prize and the 2012 Yomiuri Prize. In 2014 the German version, titled &quot;Etüden im Schnee&quot;, was published in Germany. An English edition of &quot;Etüden im Schnee&quot;, translated by Susan Bernofsky, was published by New Directions Publishing in 2016 under the title &quot;Memoirs of a Polar Bear&quot;. It won the inaugural Warwick Prize for Women in Translation.

Tawada won the 2013 Erlanger Prize for her work translating poetry between Japanese and German. 

In 2014 her novel &quot;Kentoshi&quot;, a near-future dystopian story of a great-grandfather who grows stronger while his great-grandson grows weaker, was published in Japan. An English version, translated by Margaret Mitsutani, was published in the US by New Directions Publishing in 2018 under the title &quot;The Emissary.&quot; and as &quot;The Last Children of Tokyo&quot; by Portobello Books/Granta Books in the UK.

In 2016 she received the Kleist Prize, and in 2018 she was awarded the Carl Zuckmayer Medal for services to the German language. Also in 2018, she received the National Book Award for Translated Literature (the inaugural year of that award) for her novel &quot;The Emissary&quot;, translated by Margaret Mitsutani. In 2022, her novel &quot;Scattered All Over the Earth&quot;, also translated by Mitsutani, was a National Book Award for Translated Literature finalist.

== Writing style ==

Tawada writes in Japanese and German. Scholars of her work have adopted her use of the term exophony to describe the condition of writing in a non-native language. Early in her career Tawada enlisted the help of a translator to produce German editions of her Japanese manuscripts, but later she simultaneously generated separate manuscripts in each language through a process she calls &quot;continuous translation.&quot; Over time her work has diverged by genre as well as language, with Tawada tending to write longer works such as plays and novels in Japanese, and shorter works such as short stories and essays in German. She also tends to create more neologisms when writing in German than when writing in Japanese.

Tawada&#x27;s writing highlights the strangeness of one language, or particular words in one language, when seen from the perspective of someone who speaks another language. Her writing uses unexpected words, alphabets, and ideograms to call attention to the need for translation in everyday life. She has said that language is not natural but rather &quot;artificial and magical,&quot; and has encouraged translators of her work to replace word play in her manuscripts with new word play in their own languages.

A common theme in Tawada&#x27;s work is the relationship between words and reality, and in particular the possibility that differences in languages may make assimilation into a different culture impossible. For example, Tawada has suggested that a native Japanese speaker understands different words for &quot;pencil&quot; in German and Japanese as referring to two different objects, with the Japanese word referring to a familiar pencil and the German word referring to a pencil that is foreign and &quot;other.&quot; However, her work also challenges the connection between national language and nationalism, particularly the &quot;kokugo&quot;/&quot;kokutai&quot; relationship in Japanese culture.

Tawada&#x27;s stories often involve traveling across boundaries. Her writing draws on Tawada&#x27;s own experiences of traveling between countries and cultures, but it also explores more abstract boundaries, such as the boundary between waking life and dreams, between thoughts and emotions, or between the times before and after a disaster. For example, the main character in her short story &quot;Bioskoop der Nacht&quot; dreams in a language she does not speak, and must travel to another country to learn the language and understand her own dreams. Tawada&#x27;s work also employs elements of magical realism, such as the animal and plant anthropomorphism in &quot;Memoirs of a Polar Bear&quot;, in order to challenge otherwise familiar boundaries, such as the distinction between human and animal. Challenging boundaries is further explored in &quot;The Last Children of Tokyo&quot;, in which the catastrophe against which the novel is set &quot;reconnects humans with non-human agencies, questioning the very meaning of the exclusive concept of “human”. By imagining children as going back to an earlier stage rather than ever improving – a meandering that is reflected in the novel’s non-linear, associative narration – Tawada terminates their ties to futurity, and with it the capitalist myth of continuous progress.&quot; 

Tawada has cited Paul Celan and Franz Kafka as important literary influences.

<text>Planet Patrol is an American electro group originating in the 1980s. The members were Arthur Baker, John Robie, and a quintet of vocalists led by Herbert J. Jackson (lead singer), Joseph Lites, Rodney Butler, Michael Anthony Jones, and Melvin B. Franklin (not to be confused with Melvin Franklin of The Temptations). The group only produced a single album, the self-titled &quot;Planet Patrol&quot; in 1983, which peaked at #64 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums chart.

The group&#x27;s most popular song, &quot;Play at Your Own Risk&quot;, was created from tracks that did not make the final version of Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s seminal &quot;Planet Rock&quot;.

<doc id="958686" wikidata="Q5298297" url="?curid=958686" title="Dorothy Auchterlonie Green">
<text>Dorothy Auchterlonie (also known as Dorothy Green; 28 May 1915 – 21 February 1991) was an English-born Australian academic, literary critic and poet.

==Life==
Auchterlonie was born in Sunderland, County Durham in England. In 1927 when she was 12 years old, her family moved to Australia.

Educated in both England and Australia, Auchterlonie went on to study at the University of Sydney, where she completed a first-class honours and then an M.A. in English. During her time there Auchterlonie became a member of an elite group that included the brilliant and flamboyant poet James McAuley, Joan Fraser (who wrote under the pseudonym Amy Witting), Harold Stewart, Oliver Somerville, Alan Crawford and Ronald Dunlop. James McAuley and Harold Stewart were later to become notorious for perpetrating the Ern Malley hoax. The group was described by Peter Coleman in his book on James McAuley, as the &#x27;sourly brilliant literary circle&#x27;, an oblique reference to Thomas de Quincey.

In 1944, Auchterlonie married literary historian and critic, H. M. Green (1881–1962), who was then the Librarian at the University of Sydney. She worked as an ABC broadcaster and journalist in Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra from 1942 to 1949, and, in 1955, became co-principal of a Queensland school. In 1961, she became the first female lecturer at Monash University, lecturing in literature. Her teaching career included positions at both the Australian National University and the Australian Defence Force Academy.

During her academic career (1961–1987) she threw herself into championing Australian literature and publishing literary criticism to re establish authors she felt were undervalued, notably Martin Boyd, E. L. Grant Watson, Patrick White, &#x27;Henry Handel Richardson&#x27;, Christopher Brennan, Christina Stead and Kylie Tennant. In 1963, after publisher Angus &amp; Robertson had approached her for an abridgement suitable for students, she began to revise her husband H. M. Green&#x27;s massive &quot;History of Australian Literature&quot;, republished in two volumes in 1985. Her major study of Henry Handel Richardson, &quot;Ulysses Bound&quot; was published in 1973 and revised in 1986. In 1970, she began researching a major biography of writer and biologist E. L. Grant Watson, which led to the publication of &quot;Descent of Spirit&quot; in 1990, but at her death in 1991 the project remained uncompleted.

Along with supporting environmental causes and volunteer work for the Australian Council of Churches, she was prominent in campaigning with an ADFA colleague, David Headon, in speeches and writing against nuclear arms. She visited Moscow in 1987 as one of nine Australian delegates invited to a peace forum by the USSR Government.

In 1991, a collection of Auchterlonie&#x27;s writings and papers was purchased by the National Library of Australia. Additional papers and documents are held in the Australian Defence Force Academy Library, Canberra.

==Recognition==
Auchterlonie was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 1984 and was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1988 for her services to literature, teaching and writing.

<text>Murray Irwin &quot;Moe&quot; Norman (July 10, 1929 – September 4, 2004) was a Canadian professional golfer whose accuracy and ability to hit shot after shot perfectly straight gave him the nickname &quot;Pipeline Moe&quot;. During his career Norman won 54 tournaments in Canada and set 33 course records. He has total 55 professional wins in his golf career.

Sam Snead claimed Norman was the game&#x27;s &quot;greatest striker of the ball&quot;, and Tiger Woods said Norman and Ben Hogan were the only two golfers in history to have &quot;owned their swings&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, in 1929, Norman developed his golf from childhood at the Rockway municipal course in that city, starting as a caddie in his pre-teen years. He refined his skills competing against talented area players such as Gary Cowan and Gerry Kesselring.

Norman spent most of his playing career in poverty. He spent many winters setting pins in a bowling alley for a few cents a line.

Norman&#x27;s first win was in 1949, when he won a one-day amateur event at the St. Thomas Golf and Country Club.

During 1957, Norman entered 21 separate tournaments and won 17 out of those. It was his first time shooting a 59 as well.

Norman won back-to-back Canadian Amateur Championships in 1955 and 1956. He turned professional in 1957 and played briefly on the PGA Tour, but due to shyness, bullying he encountered from certain pros, and a preference to stay in Canada, he stayed primarily in Ontario rather than travel extensively outside Canada. In the 1980s, Norman also played several events on the Senior PGA Tour.

Late in his life, Norman found better financial security when Natural Golf, an instruction company, and Titleist, a major golf manufacturer, signed him to a lifetime contract after he allegedly told a reporter, &quot;Titleist never did nothing for me.&quot; Moe would often perform golf exhibitions across Canada – Wally Uihlein, president of Titleist considered Moe&#x27;s lifetime contract a &quot;Reverse Scholarship&quot;.

Norman died in 2004 in a Kitchener hospital from congestive heart failure, having suffered from the condition since heart bypass surgery six years earlier. He also had a heart attack two years before his death.

== Playing style ==
Norman was self-taught and never took a golf lesson.

Norman&#x27;s skills as a ball striker are legendary. Sam Snead described Norman as the greatest striker of the ball. In January 2005, Tiger Woods, the biggest golf star of the modern era, told &quot;Golf Digest&quot;&#x27;s Jaime Diaz that only two golfers in history have &quot;owned their swings&quot;: Moe Norman and Ben Hogan. Stated Woods, &quot;I want to own mine.&quot;

Norman&#x27;s play, along with his way of dressing were both unconventional. He wore long-sleeved shirts in any weather, buttoned to his chin, and his pants did not fit very well. He devised what is known as &quot;The Single Plane Golf Swing&quot; —- rigid arms extended far from his body, a very wide stance with minimal knee bend, shorter-than-usual backswing and extended follow-through with minimal hand action, which produced amazingly accurate ball placement. He played extremely fast, sometimes not slowing to line up his putts.

Norman was known for sometimes unconventional behavior on the course. It is said that on one hole his caddie told him he could get to the green with a driver and a 9-iron. Naturally, he hit off the tee with his 9-iron and then hit the green with his driver.

While playing in an exhibition match with Sam Snead in 1960, rather than lay up short of a creek hazard, which could not be carried, Norman rolled his drive across the bridge which crossed the creek.

<doc id="958703" wikidata="Q347695" url="?curid=958703" title="Peter Englund">
<text>Peter Mikael Englund (born 4 April 1957) is a Swedish author and historian. He focuses on writing non-fiction books and essays, mostly about the Swedish Empire and other historical events. Englund is known for his accessible writing style, which includes narrative details that are often left out in traditional history books. His works have been translated into multiple languages, including German and Czech. From 2009 to 2015, Englund served as the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, before being succeeded by Sara Danius. In January 2019, he and fellow academy member Kjell Espmark announced their return as active members of the Swedish academy, where they had been inactive since April 2018.

==Biography==
Englund was born in Boden and studied a preparatory course for the caring professions for two years and then humanistic subjects for another two years in secondary school. He was then conscripted and served 15 months in the Swedish Army at the Norrbotten Regiment located in Boden. He was politically active in his youth and supported the National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam.

Englund studied archaeology, history, and theoretical philosophy at Uppsala University, completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1983, after which he began doctoral studies in History. He was awarded his Ph.D. in 1989 for his dissertation &quot;Det hotade huset&quot; (English title in the dissertation abstract: &quot;A House in Peril&quot;) (1989), an investigation of the worldview of the 17th-century Swedish nobility. During his period as a doctoral student, he had also worked for some time for the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service (&quot;MUST&quot;), and the year before receiving his doctorate he had published the bestselling &quot;Poltava&quot;, a detailed description of the Battle of Poltava, where the troops of Swedish king Charles XII were defeated by the Russian army of Tsar Peter I in 1709.

Englund has received the August Prize (1993) and the Selma Lagerlöf Prize for Literature (2002). He was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 2002. On 1 June 2009, he succeeded Horace Engdahl as the permanent secretary of the Academy.

In 2009, Englund &quot;criticized the jury panel as being too &#x27;Eurocentric&#x27;&quot; and &quot;told the Associated Press that it was easier for Europeans to relate to European literature&quot;. &quot;It’s the result of psychological bias that we really try to be aware of,&quot; Englund was quoted as saying. In December 2014, he announced his retirement from the post of secretary of the Swedish Academy. On 1 June 2015, Sara Danius succeeded Peter Englund as permanent secretary.

On 6 April 2018, Englund announced that he would no longer participate in the Academy&#x27;s work. On the same day, Klas Östergren and Kjell Espmark also declared that they would become inactive members of the Academy.

On 10 January 2019, Englund announced on his blog that he and fellow Academy member Kjell Espmark would be returning as active members of the Academy. He stated that continued work to renew the Academy has now reached a point that it must be done from within.

<text>Dry–mesic prairie is a native grassland community made up mid-to-tall grasses (1–2 m tall) and a diverse mixture of forbs. The sandy loam or loamy sand soils of Dry-mesic Prairie support grasses that are shorter and grow less densely than Wet-mesic and Wet Prairies. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), and porcupine grass (Hesperostipa spartea) are the most abundant grasses in dry-mesic prairie.

<text>Georgia Bright Engel (July 28, 1948 – April 12, 2019) was an American actress. She is best known for having played Georgette Franklin Baxter in the sitcom &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; from 1972 to 1977, Pat MacDougall on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; from 2003 to 2005, and Mamie Sue on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; from 2012 to 2015. She was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards and a BAFTA award.

==Early life==
Georgia Engel was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Ruth Caroline (née Hendron) and Benjamin Franklin Engel, who was a Vice Admiral in the United States Coast Guard. Engel attended the Kodiak Island Borough School District, Walter Johnson High School, and the Academy of the Washington Ballet from which she graduated. She earned her theater degree from the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

==Career==

After college, Engel appeared in musical productions with Washington&#x27;s American Light Opera Company. She moved to New York City in 1969, appearing off-Broadway in &quot;Lend an Ear&quot;, and for a year as Minnie Fay in the Broadway production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, starting in December 1969. A 1971 off-Broadway production of &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; eventually played in Los Angeles, where Engel was seen by Mary Tyler Moore and her husband, producer Grant Tinker, her soon-to-be employers.

Engel portrayed the character Georgette on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; from 1972 until the sitcom ended in 1977. The role won her two Emmy nominations. After that sitcom ended, she teamed up with former &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; co-star Betty White for &quot;The Betty White Show&quot; during its only (1977–78) season. She later co-starred on two short-lived 1980s sitcoms, &quot;Goodtime Girls&quot; as Loretta Smoot, and in &quot;Jennifer Slept Here&quot; featuring Ann Jillian.

Engel had a recurring role on &quot;Coach&quot; as Shirley Burleigh and starred as the voice of Love-a-Lot Bear in &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; (1985). She played a good witch in a 2007 recurring role of Esmeralda on the now-defunct NBC soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;. Engel received consecutive Emmy Award nominations as outstanding guest actress in a comedy series in 2003, 2004, and 2005 for her role on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; as Robert Barone&#x27;s mother-in-law, Pat MacDougall.

Engel made her &quot;big screen&quot; debut in Miloš Forman&#x27;s first English-language movie &quot;Taking Off&quot; (1971), playing &quot;Margot&quot;, a performance that earned her a BAFTA nomination for best supporting actress. Her other film appearances include &quot;The Outside Man&quot; (1973), &quot;Papa Was a Preacher&quot; (1987), &quot;Signs of Life&quot; (1989), &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; (2002), and the made-for-TV movies &quot;The Day the Women Got Even&quot; (1980) and &quot;A Love Affair: The Eleanor and Lou Gehrig Story&quot; (1978).

She lent her distinctive voice to the animated films &quot;Open Season&quot; (2006), &quot;Open Season 2&quot; (2008), &quot;Open Season 3&quot; (2010) and &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; (2001).

Engel returned to her stage roots in 2006, appearing on Broadway in the musical &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot;, with Sutton Foster and Edward Hibbert. She created the role of Mrs. Tottendale, which she continued to perform, leaving the Broadway production as of April 1, 2007. She was featured in the North American tour, performing in Toronto in September 2007, through engagements at the Orpheum Theater in San Francisco, in August 2008, and at the Denver Performing Arts Complex in October 2008.

For the summers of 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010, Engel appeared in various productions at The Muny Theater in Forest Park in St. Louis, Missouri. She also appeared in &quot;Show Boat&quot; in August 2010 as Parthy. In July 2005, she appeared in &quot;Mame&quot; as Agnes Gooch, in June 2007, she appeared in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; as Aunt Eller, and in July 2009, she appeared as Mrs. Paroo in &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

In June 2010, Engel appeared at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine, production of &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; as Mrs. Tottendale. In October through December 2010, Engel was featured in the Vineyard Theatre&#x27;s off-Broadway production of &quot;Middletown&quot;, written by Will Eno.

In 2012, she appeared in episodes of &quot;The Office&quot; as Irene, an older lady being helped by Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). She also appeared in two episodes of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; as the mother of Lyndsey McElroy, Alan&#x27;s girlfriend. The character would also become a lesbian lover of Alan&#x27;s mom, Evelyn. In March 2012, 35 years after the close of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, Engel was reunited with Betty White in the third season of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; as Mamie Sue Johnson, best friend of White&#x27;s character Elka, in a recurring role.

Engel appeared in the new Annie Baker play &quot;John&quot;, which opened off-Broadway at the Signature Theatre on July 22, 2015 (previews), directed by Sam Gold. The play ran to September 6, 2015. The cast also featured Lois Smith. Engel won a 2016 Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress and was nominated for the 2016 Lucille Lortel Award, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Play for her role in this play.

Engel starred in the musical &quot;Gotta Dance&quot;, which premiered at the Bank of America Theatre, Chicago on December 13, 2015, and ran until January 17, 2016. The cast also featured Stefanie Powers, Lillias White, and André De Shields. The musical was directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, with a book by Chad Beguelin and Bob Martin, and the score by Matthew Sklar and Nell Benjamin. The musical, under the new title of &quot;Half Time&quot;, played a limited engagement at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey. The production opened on May 31, 2018, and was scheduled to run to July 1, 2018.

==Personal life and death==
Engel was an adherent of Christian Science. She died on April 12, 2019, at the age of 70 in Princeton, New Jersey. Her friend John Quilty told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the cause was unknown as Engel did not consult doctors due to her religious beliefs. She was buried at Cape Charles Cemetery, in Cape Charles, Virginia.

<text>Red Hot Riding Hood, also known as Red and Miss Vavoom in the 1990s, is an American animated character, created by Tex Avery, who appears in several MGM short films and &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; films. She is a fictional nightclub singer and dancer who usually makes all men in the room crazy, especially a Wolf character who—in vain—tries to seduce and chase her. Red debuted in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot; (May 8, 1943), a modern-day variant of the fairy tale &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.

She appeared in seven animated shorts in the Golden age of American animation, and was revived to appear in many Hanna-Barbera TV cartoon series from the 1990s until 2013.

==History==
According to Avery, the character originated in the army, where he helped the sergeant plan training films for the animators at MGM. When the film was finished, Avery got down to the projection room, where he always &quot;ran the picture for the producer and the whole group&quot;. When the sergeant spotted the picture, much like the wolf, he roared. Word soon spread about the picture among the army. The version he showed was the uncensored version, which had a scene where the grandma marries the wolf and has children with him, and the Hays Office found that the scene strongly suggested bestiality. The scene was ultimately cut for the theatrical release.

The character was designed by Claude Smith and animated by Preston Blair, who said that the picture originally was just planned around the wolf and the grandmother (her design was inspired by the caricatures of Peter Arno), but they soon focused mainly on Red. In fact, the character was not rotoscoped, but was drawn from his imagination. The first cartoon, garnering 15,000 bookings, was so successful that it garnered various sequels, the first being &quot;The Shooting of Dan McGoo&quot;.

Jessica Rabbit of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; was inspired by Red.

<text>Richard Spink Bowles (November 16, 1912 – July 9, 1988) was a Canadian lawyer and office holder in Manitoba, Canada. He served as the province&#x27;s 16th lieutenant governor from 1965 to 1970.

Bowles had no political experience prior to his appointment as lieutenant governor, and was only the second non-political appointee to the position (James Duncan McGregor was the first, although McGregor had previously worked for the federal government in a non-partisan capacity).

Bowles was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and Manitoba Law School. He practiced law from 1937 to 1965, starting his own firm in 1940. He became the first president of Winnipeg&#x27;s Home and School Association in 1952, and was chairman of the Winnipeg Board of Parks and Recreation in 1956–57. He was named president of the Manitoba Bar Association in 1961, and also served as president of the Law Society of Manitoba in 1964–65.

His appointment as lieutenant governor came in recognition of his legal and community work. The position was primarily ceremonial by this time. Bowles might have been entrusted with determining Manitoba&#x27;s government after the inclusive 1969 election, but the defection of Liberal MLA Laurent Desjardins to the New Democratic Party made this unnecessary.

Bowles returned to private law practice after his term in office ended. In 1969, he presented an essay on Adams George Archibald (the first lieutenant governor of Manitoba) to the Manitoba Historical Society. He later served as chancellor of the University of Manitoba from 1974 to 1977.

In 1972, Bowles campaigned for the federal House of Commons as a Liberal, in the rural riding of Lisgar. Due to the prestige of his former office, there was widespread speculation that he would be appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau if elected. As it happened, however, he lost to Progressive Conservative Jack Murta by 12,784 votes, obtaining only 4,469 to Murtha&#x27;s 17,253. He did not return to political life thereafter.

<doc id="958722" wikidata="Q498760" url="?curid=958722" title="USS Guitarro (SSN-665)">
<text>USS &quot;Guitarro&quot; (SSN-665), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the guitarro, a ray of the guitarfish family.

==Construction and commissioning==
===Keel-laying and launching===
The contract to build &quot;Guitarro&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 18 December 1964 and her keel was laid down there on 9 December 1965. She was launched on 27 July 1968, sponsored by Mrs. John M. Taylor, wife of Vice Admiral John Taylor.

On 15 March 1969 during a meeting with the shipyard managers, Cmdr. William G. Lange urged them to create centralized control and designate responsibility for all construction. The shipyard representatives dismissed his idea, saying &quot;the shipyard had been building ships for a long time without the need for such a procedure and no one had been killed or equipments damaged yet.&quot;

===Sinking===
 On 15 May 1969, &quot;Guitarro&quot; was moored in the Napa River at Mare Island Naval Shipyard while construction was still underway. At about 16:00, a civilian nuclear construction group began to calibrate the aft ballast tanks, which required them to fill the tanks with approximately of water. Within 30 minutes, a different, non-nuclear civilian construction group began an assignment to bring &quot;Guitarro&quot; within a half-degree of trim; this entailed adding water to the forward ballast tanks to overcome a reported two-degree up-bow attitude. Until shortly before 20:00, both groups continued to add water, unaware of each other&#x27;s activities.

Twice between 16:30 and 20:00, a security watch advised the non-nuclear group that &quot;Guitarro&quot; was riding so low forward that the 1.5-foot-high (0.46 m) wakes of boats operating in the Napa River were sloshing into the sonar dome manhole, but the group ignored the warnings. At 19:45, the non-nuclear group stopped adding water to the ballast tanks and began to halt work for their meal break, leaving at 20:00. At 19:50, the nuclear group completed their calibrations and began to empty the tanks aft.

At 20:30, both the nuclear group, still aboard, and the non-nuclear group, returning from their break, noticed &quot;Guitarro&quot; taking a sudden down angle which put the forward hatches underwater. Massive flooding took place through several large open hatches. Efforts between 20:30 and 20:45 to close watertight doors and hatches were largely unsuccessful because lines and cables ran through the doors and hatches, preventing them from closing. At 20:55, &quot;Guitarro&quot; sank, leaving only her sail above water, earning her the nickname &quot;Mare Island Mud Puppy&quot;.

=== Causes===

In an attempt to correct what they thought was an out of trim condition, the non-nuclear construction team in the forward part of the boat purposefully defeated safety measures preventing accidentally filling ballast tanks while the sub was under construction. During construction, steel plates are welded over the ballast tanks flood ports to prevent water from getting into the tanks and putting the submarine in an unsafe condition. The construction crew put a fire hose down the tank&#x27;s vent pipe and forced it past the check valve.

The Congressional report concluded that the sinking was caused in large part by &quot;the action, or inaction, of certain construction workers who either failed to recognize an actual or potential threat to the ship&#x27;s safety or assumed that it was not their responsibility.&quot; The report stated that the &quot;lack of centralized control and responsibility for all construction&quot; was the overriding cause.

One of the factors contributing to the ship&#x27;s sinking was the open manhole used to access the bow structure sonar dome containing the boat&#x27;s sonar sphere. The manhole has a bolted cover which had been removed for maintenance purposes. The opening was protected by a cofferdam approximately high. The cofferdam was intended to prevent water from accidentally entering the dome and contacting the exposed electronic gear.

To facilitate repair work, the cofferdam and the bolted manhole cover were removed in early March 1969 and neither the cofferdam nor the cover was ever replaced. When the construction crews added and then removed water from the ballast tanks, affecting the boat&#x27;s trim, the manhole was exposed to waves caused by the wake of other vessels, causing the boat to sink at the bow, eventually filling the entire submarine.

=== Refloating===

&quot;Guitarro&quot; was refloated three days later, on 18 May 1969. Damages to her were estimated at $15.2 to $21.85 million (equivalent to $ to $ million in ).

=== Lessons learned===

Among other recommendations affecting communication, management, and supervision of ship construction, the report authors recommended that cables and lines running through watertight hatches and doors be equipped with quick disconnect fittings.

===Commissioning===
&quot;Guitarro&quot; had been scheduled to be commissioned in January 1970, but repairs necessitated by her sinking dictated a 32-month delay. She finally was commissioned on 9 September 1972.

==Service history==


In the mid-to-late 1970s, &quot;Guitarro&quot; was stationed at Point Loma in San Diego, California, commanded by Alvin H. Pauole, followed by Scott Van Hoften.

&quot;Guitarro&quot; played a major role in developing tactics for prototype combat systems deployed to the Pacific submarine fleet, in particular the new Submarine Towed Array Sensor System (STASS) along with its BQR-20 series digital sonar displays. In the mid-1970s, Guitarro also installed the first digital submarine combat system (BQQ-5 sonar and Mk-117 fire control system) and participated in the development of submarine-launched Harpoon and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

She was active at the time in the pre-operational testing of the new Tomahawk cruise missile, launching several of the missiles on a test range off the coast of Southern California.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Guitarro&quot; was decommissioned on 29 May 1992 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 18 October 1994.
