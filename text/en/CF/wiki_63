<text>The Capital Beltway is a auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Washington metropolitan area that surrounds Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, and its inner suburbs in adjacent Maryland and Virginia. It is the basis of the phrase &quot;inside the Beltway&quot;, used when referring to issues dealing with U.S. federal government and politics. The highway is signed as Interstate 495 (I-495) for its entire length, and its southern and eastern half runs concurrently with I-95. It was constructed in 1964.

This circumferential roadway, which is located mostly in Maryland and Virginia, also has a section through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River. The beltway passes through Prince George&#x27;s and Montgomery counties in Maryland and Fairfax County and the independent city of Alexandria in Virginia.

The Cabin John Parkway, a short connector between I-495 and the Clara Barton Parkway near the Potomac River along the Maryland–Virginia border, is considered an Interstate spur (I-495X) by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA).

==Route description==

Except for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of Downtown (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles Washington, D.C., in adjacent Maryland and Virginia. The two directions of travel, clockwise and counterclockwise (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the &quot;Inner Loop&quot; and the &quot;Outer Loop&quot;. The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River, south of Washington.
Most beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with I-95 and I-295 from the south, I-66 from the west, and U.S. Route 50 (US 50) from the west and the east are among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the beltway into DC are offered by the George Washington Memorial Parkway along the Virginia side of the Potomac River, the Clara Barton Parkway along the Maryland side of the river, and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (B–W Parkway), approaching Washington DC from the northeast.

Initially, the entire beltway was simply I-495, and I-95 was planned to serve Downtown from the south and north, intersecting the beltway in Virginia and Maryland. However, environmental litigation stopped the completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the beltway from the south northward into Downtown was redesignated I-395 in 1977. The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side. In 1989, the I-495 designation was also returned to the eastern portion, with the highway cosigned as I-95 and I-495 along this route.

===District of Columbia===

The beltway—here I-95 and I-495 together and four lanes in each direction—travels over the tidal Potomac River on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge between Alexandria, Virginia, and the neighborhood of National Harbor of Oxon Hill, Maryland. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) recognizes of the bridge as crossing the tip of the southernmost corner of the District of Columbia, but, while there are signs acknowledging the Maryland and Virginia state borders, there are none for DC.

===Maryland===
==== Prince George&#x27;s County ====

The beltway (where I-95 and I-495 together) enters Maryland during its Potomac River crossing over the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, west of Forest Heights and National Harbor as a 10-lane highway with a local–express lane configuration including three local lanes and two express lanes in each direction. After crossing the Potomac River, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction and immediately meets the southern terminus of I-295, known as the Anacostia Freeway, a route that serves Downtown to the north, connecting in Washington, D.C., to I-695. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard, which links the National Harbor with the beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm and next intersects Maryland Route 210 (MD 210; Indian Head Highway), a major north–south route from southern DC to Indian Head in Charles County, which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.
Heading eastward, the beltway&#x27;s (I-95/I-495) local–express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including MD 5 and MD 4 on either side of Andrews Air Force Base, which the beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into DC and southeastward into Southern Maryland.) Past the MD 4 interchange, the beltway turns north through Glenarden, interchanging with MD 202.

The beltway then interchanges with US 50/unsigned I-595, a major highway from Downtown eastward to Annapolis and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the beltway slightly northward) provide access to New Carrollton station serving Washington Metro&#x27;s Orange Line, MARC Train&#x27;s Penn Line, and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor railroad line and the New Carrollton area.
Turning northwest, the beltway then enters Greenbelt Park, intersecting the B–W Parkway on the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B–W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with MD 201, which connects to the southern terminus of the B–W Parkway at US 50 near the DC line. Now turned fully west, the beltway runs through the northern edge of College Park, interchanging with the access roadway for Greenbelt station serving Washington Metro&#x27;s Green Line and MARC Train&#x27;s Camden Line in Greenbelt, then US 1.

Beyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast toward Baltimore. The interchange includes access to a park-and-ride lot, paved initially as part of I-95&#x27;s route within the beltway.

==== Montgomery County ====

Continuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into Montgomery County, entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath MD 212 with no access, the route interchanges with MD 650 near the George Washington Cemetery. After bisecting Northwest Branch Park, the beltway interchanges with MD 193 and US 29 south of Four Corners; the two interchanges are little more than half a mile () apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown Silver Spring, continuing into Washington, D.C.
Squeezing past Argyle Local Park and Sligo Creek Golf Course, the beltway interchanges with MD 97 northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as Rock Creek Parkway. The route twists along the alignment, through and around Rock Creek Park, then interchanges with MD 185 near the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of I-270, which extends northwestward to meet I-70 in Frederick.

I-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y junction, with two separate high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) connections to I-270&#x27;s HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from MD 355 (formerly US 240). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.
Interchanging with Old Georgetown Road (MD 187), I-495 soon meets the I-270 Spur, the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging Y junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the MD 190 and Cabin John Parkway interchanges. (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the Potomac and Great Falls areas of Montgomery County, while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the Clara Barton Parkway along the Potomac River.)

After these interchanges, the beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the Potomac River; this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, D.C., and westward toward the Potomac River&#x27;s Great Falls. After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the Mather Gorge into Virginia over the 10-lane American Legion Memorial Bridge.

===Virginia===
Immediately after crossing into Fairfax County, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the George Washington Memorial Parkway at a trumpet interchange; the parkway provides a scenic route to Arlington and Downtown. The beltway then continues south, next interchanging with State Route 193 (SR 193) south of Dranesville District Park, then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the Dulles Access Road, SR 267, and SR 123. The eastbound Dulles Access Road also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop beltway traffic. The former interchange with the toll road (SR 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the Tysons business district.
Now running south, the beltway interchanges with SR 7 (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons; passing Dunn Loring to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with I-66, which extends westward to I-81 in the Shenandoah Valley near Strasburg and eastward to Arlington and Downtown. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound Dulles Access Road exit to the north in order to reach I-66 east. There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The Dulles Access Road leads to Dulles International Airport, which then changes over to the Dulles Greenway and ends at Leesburg.
South of the I-66 interchange, the beltway crosses under US 29 and SR 237 with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, US 50, and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified single-point urban interchanges. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.

Continuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of Mill Creek Park before interchanging with SR 236 southwest of Annandale Community Park. Running along the eastern edge of Wakefield Park, the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with SR 620 before turning east near Flag Run Park and entering Springfield, meeting the Springfield Interchange with I-95 southeast of the Shirley Industrial Complex.

I-95 joins the beltway within the Springfield Interchange. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of I-395 within the same massive interchange complex.

Running due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of Backlick Stream Valley Park, the beltway (now I-95/I-495) interchanges with SR 613 east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of Loftridge and Burgundy parks, the two routes enter Alexandria and soon reach SR 241, a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction. Within the interchange, the beltway nears the western approach to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.

Continuing east, the two routes encounter US 1, a major north–south highway providing access to Alexandria, Arlington, and Downtown, as well as various points south in Fairfax County. Finally, beyond this complex interchange, I-95 and I-495 together cross Alexandria&#x27;s Jones Point Park and exit Virginia via the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.

==History==
The idea of building a highway around the Washington, D.C., suburbs had been discussed at least since 1944, when Fred W. Tummler, director of planning of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, proposed an Inter-County Metropolitan Freeway. The Senate Committee on Public Works backed the idea of building the highway in 1951, asking the Bureau of Public Roads to prepare plans for the highway. Backed by Senator Francis H. Case of South Dakota, the plan called for the highway to begin in Beltsville at the nearly completed B–W Parkway, continue west through Silver Spring and Bethesda, cross the Potomac River over a new bridge, head south near Tysons Corner and Falls Church, turn east by the Shirley Memorial Highway, and end at US 1 in Gum Springs. A 1952 amendment called for continuing the highway past Alexandria, over the Potomac River on a new bridge, and reconnect to the B–W Parkway in Maryland. By December 1952, the plan had evolved into a highway that fully encircled Washington DC&#x27;s suburbs. The highway was intended to reduce traffic and also to offer an alternative route for the military in case of emergency. The federal government gave final approval for the construction of the Capital Beltway (also known as the Circumferential Highway in the planning stages) on September 28, 1955. The first section of the beltway (including the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.
Originally designated I-495, in 1977, the eastern portion of the beltway was redesignated I-95 when a proposed alignment of I-95 from New York Avenue in Washington, D.C., through Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;,
In 1989, the I-495 designation was restored to the eastern portion, making it a dual I-95/I-495.

Traveling clockwise, the beltway is designated as the &quot;Inner Loop&quot;; traveling counterclockwise, it is designated as the &quot;Outer Loop&quot;. This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the beltway and on the on-highway signage, &quot;Inner Loop&quot; and &quot;Outer Loop&quot; shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.

The beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington, D.C. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington, D.C., suburbs following the beltway&#x27;s completion quickly made the beltway the area&#x27;s &quot;main street&quot; for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus Northern Virginia, also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the beltway to Virginia. The newer Fairfax County Parkway in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete outer beltway in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground because local governments in Maryland object to building additional Potomac River crossings as well as destroying protected &quot;open space&quot; and creating sprawl.

===College Park Interchange===
The College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park, Maryland. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore and Capital beltways. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into Washington, D.C., as the Northeast Freeway, joining the North Central Freeway within DC and running south toward the central business district. When the DC government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a concurrency of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.

Originally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for US 1. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new collector–distributor lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the park and ride was built.

===Traffic congestion===
Despite and because of numerous widening projects during its history (particularly in Virginia), heavy traffic on the beltway is a continuing problem. The Woodrow Wilson Bridge—where eight lanes were squeezed into six—was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.

Two intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the &quot;worst bottlenecks in the nation&quot;. They are the I-495 at I-270 interchange in Montgomery County, Maryland, ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The Springfield Interchange, where I-395, I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as &quot;The Mixing Bowl&quot;. although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated interchange complex adjacent to the Pentagon on the original Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway (currently better-known as I-395) at SR 27 in Arlington.

In April 2005, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) signed an agreement with two private companies to build high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes on the stretch of the beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike. Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them &quot;Lexus Lanes&quot; because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial Intercounty Connector project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The MDOT SHA&#x27;s Purple Line light rail transit line, under construction , is just one example.

The beltway has been continuously modified since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County. The interchange between I-95 and the beltway in Prince George&#x27;s County was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between US 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George&#x27;s County was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the beltway&#x27;s original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north–south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the beltway for approximately . As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.

In January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Senator Joanne C. Benson of Prince George&#x27;s County proposed legislation (Senate Bill 55) to increase the speed limit of the Maryland section of the beltway from in a bid to reduce traffic congestion on the beltway.

===Bridge and interchange improvements===

The Springfield Interchange in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007. The eight-year, nearly $676-million (equivalent to $ in ) project worked to eliminate weaving among local and long-distance traffic between I-95, I-395, the beltway, and SR 644.


The Woodrow Wilson Bridge underwent reconstruction in a major project that began in 1999; it now provides express and local lanes for both the Inner and Outer loops. The new Woodrow Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.

Also, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the Telegraph Road and US 1 interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia, were rebuilt. The I-295 and MD 210 interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvements lasted through 2013.

The Branch Avenue (MD 5) Interchange was also improved.

===Virginia HOT lanes===
VDOT authorized a public–private partnership to construct HOT lanes in Northern Virginia. The project added two lanes to I-495 in each direction from just west of the Springfield Interchange to just north of the Dulles Toll Road and included the replacement of more than 50 bridges, overpasses, and major interchanges.

Drivers of vehicles with fewer than three occupants are required to pay a toll to use the lanes. Tolls change dynamically, with higher tolls charged during periods of heaviest congestion. Drivers using the HOT lanes are required to carry an E-ZPass transponder to allow electronic toll collection, eliminating the need for tollbooths. Tolls are waived for buses, carpools of at least three people, motorcycles, and emergency vehicles with an E-ZPass Flex transponder set to the &quot;HOV ON&quot; configuration. If more than a specified number of carpools or busses use the lanes, Virginia must pay the tolls for the excess vehicles.

At the north and south terminal of the HOT lanes, motorists are able to transition directly between the HOT lanes and the I-495 general purpose lanes. However, elsewhere along the corridor, access to and from the HOT lanes is only permitted from cross roads. Some cross roads provide access to both HOT lanes and general purpose lanes; others have access only to one system or the other. Many HOT lane access points serve traffic in only one direction of I-495, which is intended to complement typical commuting patterns. HOT lane interchanges are as follows:

The original scope of the HOT project is covered by a fixed-price $1.3-billion (equivalent to $ in ) contract between concessionaire Capital Beltway Express LLC and contractor Fluor Corporation. 

In 2004, Transurban joined the Fluor Corporation team to serve as concessionaire and long-term operator of the HOT lanes. After a competitive procurement, the team was selected to deliver and operate the new HOT lanes. After a series of public meetings and environmental studies, the project was approved and funded in 2007. Construction began in mid-2008. The express lanes were opened for public access on November 17, 2012.

In March 2022, VDOT and Transurban commenced on a two and a half mile northern extension of the I-495 HOT lanes from VA 267 to just south of the American Legion Memorial Bridge (4-4 to 4-2-2-4 configuration). A new flyover is to be constructed to connect eastbound VA 267 with the northbound HOT Lanes, and an exit and entry ramp are to be constructed to enable access from the HOT lanes to the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The collector distributor lane on southbound I 495 from the parkway to VA 193 (Georgetown Pike) will reconstructed, and the underpasses at VA 267 and Scott Run, and the overpasses at Lewinsville Road, Old Dominion Drive, VA 193, and the parkway will be rebuilt as well. VA 193 will be widened within the vicinity of its interchange with the Beltway. The express lanes are expected to be opened to the public in late 2025, and the project itself is expected to be completed on 2026.

===Maryland express toll lane proposal===

In September 2017, Governor Larry Hogan announced a plan to widen the portion of I-495 in Maryland by four lanes, adding express toll lanes to the median, as part of an $11-billion-or-more (equivalent to $ or more in ) proposal to widen roads in Maryland. The project would be a public–private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the lanes. On June 5, 2019, the Maryland Board of Public Works voted 2–1 in favor of the proposal to construct express toll lanes along I-495, with Governor Hogan and State Comptroller Peter Franchot voting for it and State Treasurer Nancy Kopp voting against it. The widening and addition of express toll lanes along I-495 would be split into two phases, with the first phase expanding the road in Montgomery County and the second phase expanding the road in Prince George&#x27;s County. On June 12, 2019, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCCPC) sent a letter of nonconcurrence to MDOT SHA, triggering a mediation process with the state. The M-NCPPC has jurisdiction over parkland that MDOT SHA would need for its proposal.

In August 2022, the FHWA approved the proposed project. In October 2022, environmental and historic preservation groups filed suit against the state, citing deficiencies in the environmental review process and the projected impacts on Plummers Island. In November 2022, the Maryland Department of Transportation announced that it would not award a contract for construction of the proposed toll lane project until after Governor Hogan has left office in January 2023. Decisions on the project will be made by the administration of newly elected governor Wes Moore and the Board of Public Works.

===Exit numbering===
Exit numbers on the beltway have gone through several iterations. Originally, all exits on the beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria, and the last exit number being 38 for I-295 in Prince George&#x27;s County. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as I-95, exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts. This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia. Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the American Legion Memorial Bridge and the Springfield Interchange—I-495&#x27;s intersection with I-395 and I-95 in Virginia—became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to the American Legion Memorial Bridge. The exit numbers between the Springfield Interchange and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the beltway but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the Baltimore Beltway, have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.

==Exit list==
===Mainline===
Prior to 2000, the commonwealth of Virginia reset exit numbers at state lines and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.






















===Express lanes===

The entire route is in Fairfax County, Virginia.

<doc id="960281" wikidata="Q1201832" url="?curid=960281" title="Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis">
<text>The Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis (Russian: Теракт в Будённовске, &quot;teract [terrorist act] in Budyonnovsk&quot;) took place from 14 to 19 June 1995, when a group of Chechen separatists led by Shamil Basayev attacked the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk (alternatively transliterated as Budennovsk) near the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, during the First Chechen War of 1994–1996. After brief fighting in the city, Basayev and his men took over a local hospital complex where they gathered over 2,000 mostly civilian hostages, demanding a ceasefire in Chechnya and the resumption of Russian negotiations with Chechen leadership. Following several failed attempts by the Russian government to respond to the situation by force, Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin personally agreed to Basayev&#x27;s demands, securing the release of the hostages. The terrorist act in Budyonnovsk was the first hostage crisis in modern Russian history.

==Initial attack==
Shamil Basayev&#x27;s group of more than 100 Chechen separatist &quot;smertniki&quot; (ready to die) fighters crossed from the south of embattled Chechnya through the Russian republic of Dagestan into the Russian republic of Stavropol Krai. They concealed themselves in a column of three KamAZ military trucks and a police VAZ-2106 car, their drivers dressed as Russian servicemen and pretending to be bringing a &quot;Cargo 200&quot; load of corpses of dead Russian troops back from the war zone.

At about noon on 14 June, the column was stopped by the local police at Budyonnovsk, some 110 km north of Chechnya, and ordered to drive to the city&#x27;s main police station for an inspection. Having arrived there, Chechen fighters suddenly emerged from the trucks and opened fire, storming and capturing the police headquarters as well as the city hall, and raising Chechen flags over local administration offices. Over the next several hours, as Russian reinforcements arrived, the Chechens retreated to the residential district and regrouped in the city&#x27;s main hospital, taking hostages on their way. During the clashes and on the way to the hospital, the attackers killed as many as 41 people, including police officers, soldiers, personnel from Budyonnovsk air base, and civilians.

==Hostage crisis==
At the hospital complex, which they quickly fortified and rigged with c-4 explosives, Basayev&#x27;s 119-strong and well-armed group held more than 2,000 people (some estimates are as high as 5,000) hostage, most of them civilians, including 150 children and several women with newborn infants. Basayev issued an ultimatum, threatening to kill the hostages unless his demands were met. These included an end to the First Chechen War, an amnesty for Chechen fighters, and direct negotiations by Russia with the representatives of Chechen president Dzokhar Dudayev. He also demanded that Russian authorities immediately bring reporters to the scene and allow them to enter the Chechen position in the hospital. Russian authorities, in turn, threatened to kill 2,000 Chechen prisoners if Basayev did not surrender. Russian president Boris Yeltsin immediately vowed to do everything possible to free the hostages, denouncing the attack as &quot;unprecedented in cynicism and cruelty&quot;. Over 300 hostages were released through low-level negotiations on June 14 and 15.

At about 8 pm on 15 June, the Chechens killed one hostage, a military registration and enlistment official. The following day, when the reporters did not arrive at the arranged time, five additional male hostages were shot to death on Basayev&#x27;s order. &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted the hospital&#x27;s chief doctor that &quot;several of the Chechens had just grabbed five hostages at random and shot them to show the world they were serious in their demands that Russian troops leave their land.&quot; The five men taken outside to a courtyard and shot were, according to conflicting reports, either five military helicopter pilots, or three pilots and two policemen. Basayev himself explained the choice of the pilots as a result of his personal &quot;special relationship&quot; with them, referring to the death of his wife, child, and sister in an airstrike two week earlier, which he had sworn to avenge. Russian security minister Sergei Stepashin called the reports of the execution &quot;a bluff&quot;. Later, however, Russian authorities relented and allowed a group of journalists to enter the hospital for a press conference, at which Basayev repeated his demands publicly.

On the third day of the siege, Russian authorities ordered security forces to retake the hospital compound. The task was given to a grouping of MVD and FSB special forces, including the elite units Alfa and Vympel, supported by armored vehicles and armed helicopters. The Russians attacked the next day (June 17) at dawn, meeting fierce resistance. After several hours of fighting, in which many hostages were killed by crossfire, a local ceasefire was agreed on and Basayev released more hostages, including all pregnant women and nursing mothers with their children. A second Russian attack on the hospital a few hours later also failed, and so did a third, resulting in further casualties. The Russian authorities accused the Chechens of using the hostages as human shields. Yeltsin&#x27;s human rights advisor Sergey Kovalyov described the scene: &quot;In half an hour the hospital was burning, and it was not until the next morning that we found out what happened there as a result of this shooting. I saw with my own eyes pieces of human flesh stuck to the walls and the ceiling and burned corpses.&quot; Nevertheless, the Russian troops had freed some hostages and Basayev soon released all remaining women and children. Both sides also agreed to the arrival of fire trucks and ambulances at the hospital to put out fires and evacuate the dead.

==Resolution of the crisis==
On 18 June, direct negotiations between Shamil Basayev and Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin led to a compromise, which ultimately became a turning point for the First Chechen War. In a televised conversation with Basayev, Chernomyrdin agreed to halt military actions in Chechnya and begin top-level talks with separatist leaders. He then signed the formal statement:

The agreement resulted in the release of 350 additional hostages. Yeltsin meanwhile had gone to the summit of the G8 in Canada. After meeting with Yeltsin, the Group of Eight condemned violence on both sides of the Chechen conflict. When asked about the crisis by a journalist, Yeltsin denounced the rebels as ″horrible bandits with black bands on their foreheads″ (″Это оголтелые бандиты, понимаешь, с чёрными повязками″).

On 19 June, all remaining hostages were released. Basayev&#x27;s group, along with a group of over 100 volunteer hostages (16 journalists, nine State Duma deputies including Kovalev, Oleg Orlov, Mikhail Molostvov, Aleksandr Osovtsov, Valeriy Borshchev, Yuliy Rybakov and Viktor Borodin, and numerous other government officials, medical workers, and previously released hostages) boarded six buses and traveled to Chechnya through North Ossetia and Dagestan. Despite a rogue plot by interior ministry general Anatoly Kulikov to eliminate Basayev in an ambush at the blocked Chechen border, the bus convoy eventually reached the Chechen settlement of Zandak near the border with Dagestan. The volunteer hostages were then released, while Basayev, accompanied by some of the journalists, went on to the southern Chechen village of Dargo, Vedensky District, where he was welcomed as a hero. 

==Casualties and damage==
According to official figures, at least 129 people were killed and 415 were injured (including 18 who later died of their wounds) as a result of the attack. One official death toll included 105 civilians, 11 police and at least 14 military fatalities. However, according to an independent estimate, as many as 166 hostages were killed and 541 injured in the special forces assault on the hospital. A report submitted by Russia to the Council of Europe stated that a total of 130 civilians, 18 policemen, and 17 soldiers had been killed, and more than 400 people had been wounded. Of Basayev&#x27;s forces, 11 men were killed and one went missing; most of the bodies were eventually returned to Chechnya in a refrigerator truck.

Over 160 buildings in the town were destroyed or damaged during the crisis, including 54 municipal buildings and 110 private houses. Many of the former hostages suffered psychological trauma and were treated at a special facility in Budyonnovsk.

==Aftermath==
The government&#x27;s handling of the hostage crisis was perceived as inept by many Russians. The State Duma passed a motion of no confidence by a vote of 241 to 72; however, this was seen as purely symbolic, and the government did not resign. The debacle ultimately led to the resignations of FSB director Sergei Stepashin and interior minister Viktor Yerin on 30 June 1995.

The raid is widely seen as the turning point in the war. It boosted morale among the hard-pressed Chechen separatists, shocked the Russian public, and discredited the Russian government. The negotiations sparked by the attack provided the Chechens with time to regroup and rearm. After peace talks broke down and hostilities resumed, Russian forces never truly regained a position of strength, and the war concluded in August 1996 with a Chechen military victory.

In the years following the hostage crisis, more than 40 of the surviving attackers were tracked down and killed, including Aslambek Abdulkhadzhiev in 2002. At least 20 were sentenced by the Stavropol territorial court to various terms of imprisonment.

<text>Andrew Jackson Grayson (1819–1869) was an American ornithologist and artist.

Grayson was the author of &quot;Birds of the Pacific Slope&quot; (1853–69), which he considered to be a completion of John James Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Grayson was born August 20, 1819, in the northwest corner of Louisiana, on the Ouachita River, where his father had a cotton plantation. Later on, his father sent him to St. Mary&#x27;s College in St. Louis, Missouri. There, they discouraged him from studying art.

He developed a talent for drawing the birds he observed in the bayous while in his teens. However, he was once punished by a schoolteacher for drawing instead of doing his lessons. Admonished by his father, he stopped drawing birds for the next 25 years.

==Moving west==
After his father died, Mr. Grayson used his inherited funds to invest in a small store. As he ignored it for the most part it went out of business fairly quickly. After meeting frontiersmen in his college years, he developed an insatiable urge to move west. After he married his wife, Frances J. Timmons, on July 21, 1842, they decided to move to California. They had a child in 1845, Edward B. Grayson, and moved to St. Louis to begin the journey. In April 1846, Grayson led a party of migrants out of Independence, Missouri. Other groups joined along the way. At Fort Bridging, a conman, L. W. Hastings, persuaded one of the groups to take a shortcut through a mountain pass. They ended up being the Donner Party.

The party Grayson led reached Fort Hall, Idaho. In between there and California, Grayson lost half his group. In late 1846, they reached San Francisco.

==Early California days==
Once Grayson settled in San Francisco, he instantly joined a military group led by Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. During this given period of time, he became a colonel. After he came back from the war, he took no breaks in settling down. He invested in several San Franciscan business ventures, and established the town of Grayson along the San Joaquin river. However, because he had no interest in business, most of these ventures failed.

==Taxa named after Grayson==
Two bird species and several other taxa have been named in honor of Grayson. They are mainly from the Revillagigedo Islands and other islands offshore Pacific Mexico. As with much island fauna, several are endangered or extinct:

Birds:
* &quot;Micrathene whitneyi graysoni&quot; - Socorro elf owl (probably extinct since c. 1970)
* &quot;Mimus graysoni&quot; - Socorro mockingbird (critically endangered)
* &quot;Parula pitiayumi graysoni&quot; - Socorro tropical parula
* &quot;Zenaida graysoni&quot; - Socorro dove (extinct in the wild)
Other:
* &quot;Cambarus graysoni&quot; - a Cambaridae crayfish
* &quot;Ochrotrichia graysoni&quot; - a Hydroptilidae caddisfly
* &quot;Sylvilagus graysoni&quot; - Tres Marias cottontail rabbit (endangered)

<doc id="960291" wikidata="Q6252420" url="?curid=960291" title="John Peel (writer)">
<text>John Peel (born 1954) is a British writer, best known for his TV series tie-in novels and novelisations. He has written under several pseudonyms, including &quot;John Vincent&quot; and &quot;Nicholas Adams&quot;. He lives on Long Island, New York. While his wife is a US citizen, Peel continues to travel under a British passport.

==Career==
During the 1980s, Peel wrote a licensed spin-off novel based on the popular 1960s TV series &quot;The Avengers&quot;, titled &quot;Too Many Targets&quot;. He is also known for his various books based on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot; (written as &quot;John Vincent&quot;).

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot; books===
A friend of the television writer Terry Nation, Peel wrote novelisations of several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories for Target Books featuring Nation&#x27;s Daleks; he is reportedly one of the few writers to have been willing to do so, given the high percentage of the author&#x27;s fee that Nation&#x27;s agents demanded for the rights to use the Daleks. For similar reasons, Peel is one of the few novelists to have used the Daleks in full-length, original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels, examples of which include &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; (1997) and &quot;Legacy of the Daleks&quot; (1998), written for the BBC Books &quot;Eighth Doctor Adventures&quot; range. Neither novel was especially well received by fans of the series, in part due to Peel&#x27;s re-writing of Dalek history as depicted in the TV series (in particular the destruction of Skaro in the 1988 serial &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;), to bring their story more into line with Nation&#x27;s vision.

With the publication of &quot;&quot; (1991), Peel became the first author to write a full-length &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel, featuring the Doctor, not to be based on either a TV or radio script. He had been selected by editor Peter Darvill-Evans to launch the &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot; range, to resume the story of the Doctor&#x27;s travels from where the now-cancelled TV series had left off. He also wrote the &quot;Evolution&quot; (1994) for their sister range, &quot;Missing Adventures&quot; (featuring previous Doctors and companions), and also &quot;The Gallifrey Chronicles&quot; (1991, not to be confused with the &quot;Eighth Doctor Adventures&quot; book), a compendium of the history of the Doctor&#x27;s planet, Gallifrey.

<text>The Socorro dove or Grayson&#x27;s dove (Zenaida graysoni) is a dove species which is extinct in the wild. It was endemic to Socorro Island in the Revillagigedo Islands off the west coast of Mexico. The last sighting in its natural habitat was in 1972 and it survives only in captivity. A reintroduction program is being prepared.

It is a close relative of the mourning and eared doves, particularly the former, and was at one time considered a subspecies. In captivity, it hybridizes with the former and almost all privately owned birds as well as several of the captive breeding program birds are known or strongly suspected to be hybrids. These are excluded from the reintroduction program as there is evidence of unique adaptations in the Socorro species. The scientific name commemorates Zénaïde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte and the American ornithologist and artist Andrew Jackson Grayson.

== Description ==
The Socorro dove is a medium-sized, principally terrestrial dove with long legs for a zenaida dove. It is long and weighs on average. In overall color pattern, it agrees with its relatives. It is considered to be a stronger-colored insular representative of the mourning dove. The male is deep cinnamon on its head and underparts, with an ear streak like its relatives. The nape is blue-grey and the neck has an iridescent pink patch, most prominent after moult. The upperparts are rufous brown. Female and juvenile coloration is slightly duller. The most conspicuous differences from the mourning dove, darker coloration and more well-developed feet, were useful amid the dark lava rock and the shady forests of its island home, where native mammalian predators were absent but constant threats from red-tailed hawks and great frigatebirds were present. The advertising call begins with a disyllabic coo, followed by three single calls, and ends with another disyllabic coo: &quot;Coo-oo, OO, OO, OO, Coo-oo&quot;. Each of these 5 elements takes a little less than one second.

The arid and fairly barren Clarión Island, some west of Socorro, has an endemic subspecies of the mourning dove, &quot;Zenaida macroura clarionensis&quot;. These birds are roughly intermediate in appearance between the Socorro dove and the mainland mourning doves. It is highly likely that they represent a later colonization by mourning doves (rather than earlier stock), which evolved its phenotype independently from but in parallel with the Socorro birds. This would mean that predation by great frigatebirds is significant enough to select towards a cryptic darkening of the plumage, as these are the only predators of &quot;Z. m. clarionensis&quot;. On a semidesert island such as Clarión, birds would be expected to evolve towards lighter plumage, to better withstand the heat and lack of reliable freshwater sources, in accordance with Gloger&#x27;s Rule.

The upper elevation limit of the doves is 950 m.

== Ecology ==
There is marked behavioral difference to the mourning dove. When Andrew Jackson Grayson discussed the species, he called it the &quot;solitary dove&quot; because he never saw more than one male and one female together. The doves, particularly the adult males, chase away their young as soon as these can fend for their own and the partners split for the time being. This too is believed to be in adaptation to the former dominance of aerial predators, lest local concentrations of birds, let alone young, inexperienced ones, would present easy targets for the hawks. Typical of many birds on islands lacking mammals, Socorro doves also show little fear of humans or introduced predators, including cats, which proved a major factor in its extirpation.

The last habitat in which this dove was found is the low seasonally humid forest above 500 m ASL. Before the introduction of cats, it seasonally descended into the lowlands where it was &quot;common&quot; in March 1953 for example. It may be that this coincided with the peak of the breeding season, when many birds had dependent young and dispersed widely to gather more varied food. This was the case in the Socorro mockingbird, the other mid-sized native landbird of Socorro, which apparently has very similar habitat preferences.

Its last refuge was dominated by endemic &quot;Guettarda insularis&quot;, &quot;Ilex socorroensis&quot; and &quot;Sideroxylon socorrense&quot;, as well as black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), &quot;Ficus cotinifolia&quot; fig trees and &quot;Psidium socorrense&quot; guavas, apparently all native on Socorro. At least at the time of the last record, it seemed to be dependent on intact understorey of Euphorbiaceae (spurges and relatives) and ferns, maybe because cats hunt less efficiently in the dense foliage. It is frugivorous and, as is often the case in Columbidae, might have played an important role in the reproduction of the trees which dominate its habitat. One of these (&quot;S. socorrense&quot;) is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. In particular, it was found to associate with the fig trees.

Virtually nothing is known about breeding in the wild. However, each generation is estimated to be about 6.6 years. Parallels in altitudinal migration with the equally solitary mockingbird might be taken as indication that the breeding activity peaked around March through April. In captivity, the female generally lays two white eggs in a nest box 1–2.5 m above ground. The incubation lasts from 14 to 17 days, and the young birds fledge after around 14 to 20 days.

== Extinction in the wild ==
The primary reason for the extirpation of the Socorro dove is predation by feral cats, but other pressures may have also contributed. In 1856, sheep were introduced, which resulted in a major alteration to the vegetation of the island, turning most areas below into open vegetation. This may have caused some decline in their numbers, but did not pose an existential risk to the species. However, in 1957, a military base was established on the island. The evidence found by Jehl and Parkes suggested that feral cats had been introduced at the time that the military base was established, which was ultimately the cause of the species’ extinction. Two expeditions, in 1978 and 1981, failed to find the species, and it was declared extinct in the wild in 1983.

The species avoided complete extinction due to the collection of several doves by an expedition in 1925. The subsequent use of these doves in aviculture resulted in about one hundred doves being available for captive breeding programs, beginning in the late 1980s.
The species reproduces no less willingly in captivity than other &quot;Zenaida&quot; doves, provided its different ecological needs are addressed. As of May 2023, the captive population numbered 156 birds, all in zoos and other facilities in Europe and North America. As of early 2006, it was being prepared to remove the sheep and to rid the island of cats. In the meantime, with the maintenance of the remaining birds, stock for reintroduction is being provided.

== Reintroduction efforts ==
In order to protect these birds and eventually reintroduce them into the wild, various reintroduction and conservation efforts have germinated. In 1994, the birds&#x27; native island of Socorro was declared a biosphere preserve. In addition, as the number of birds in captivity is only slightly above 100, various associations have begun breeding programs. These include the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) as well as zoos in Frankfurt and Cologne. In 2013, the breeding program was successfully introduced into Mexico by the EAZA in collaboration with various government agencies such as the SEMAR, SEMARNAT, and the Mexican Navy.

=== Specific actions ===
Construction of aviaries on Socorro Island began in 2003. Avian Malaria and trichomoniasis were detected during screens of other dove populations on neighboring islands in December 2003 and January 2004. As a result, recommendations for protection of the reintroduction population were put forward. Construction of aviaries was completed in 2005. The same year, plans were outlined to assess the level of soil erosion on Socorro as a result of vegetation loss. In 2006, there was an outbreak of avian influenza in Europe, and therefore 12 doves were sent to Albuquerque Biological Park to create a separate reserve population. In 2008, the Edinburgh and Paignton Zoos sent 12 chicks from their breeding program to the Albuquerque Zoo as part of the collective aggregation effort. The original plan was to reintroduce the birds into Mexico in 2008, but was delayed due to import restrictions and permits, so a stock of viable individuals was kept in the US. In 2010, by using hunting and telemetry, all sheep had been eradicated from the island. The stock aggregated in the United States was finally transferred to Mexico in 2013. , the problem of cats and house-mice has yet to be resolved on Socorro Island.

In addition to efforts to control cats, other animals, and human activity, such as ATV usage, on Socorro Island, efforts are also underway to control locust swarms on the island. Outbreaks of &quot;Schistocerca piceifrons&quot; have occurred at least twice a year on the island since 1994, and has resulted in damage to native flowers and vegetation.

<text>Tunç Hamarat (born December 1, 1946) is a Turkish chess player living in Austria and the sixteenth ICCF World Champion, 1999–2004.

Born in Istanbul, Hamarat attended the Austrian St. Georgs-Kolleg high school in Istanbul, and then graduated in Physics from the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ) in Ankara. In 1972, he moved to Vienna, Austria for his Master&#x27;s degree in Physics Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology there. In 1976, he went temporarily back to İzmir, Turkey for military service. Since 1972 he has been living in Austria and has been an Austrian citizen since 1994. Recently, he is working for a telecommunication company in Vienna.

During the sixteenth ICCF World Championship, he had amassed an unassailable 11 points out of 15 games with one game remaining. Hamarat was deadly on the black side of the Sicilian Sveshnikov, beating former CC World Champion Horst Rittner of Germany and Greek International Master Spyros Kofidis with it. At one time, Hamarat was supposed not to have lost a single game as White in over 40 years. However, this retroactively ceased to be the case, as correspondence chess games date from their year of initiation, and Hamarat eventually lost games playing with the white pieces against Edgar Prang (started in 2001) and Hans Marcus Elwert (started in 2002), though he apparently resigned these only after he became World Champion in January 2004. In &#x27;over-the-board&#x27; chess, he played in the finals of the Turkish championships three times. In Vienna, he played in the top league. But since 1963 his main interest has been correspondence chess, &quot;because I am a perfectionist&quot;, he says. In 1997, he earned the title of International Grandmaster of Correspondence Chess.

Hamarat also plays backgammon professionally. He is one of the top players in Austria. He won several titles in international backgammon tournaments. Besides, he is also an expert in jazz music, and acts as a jazz DJ in Vienna.

The Austrian mail authority issued a personified postage stamp with his picture in his honor. The &quot;Wiener Zeitung&quot;, an important newspaper, named him as the &#x27;Viennese of the month&#x27;.

<text>John Peel (13th November 1776? – 13 November 1854) was an English huntsman who is the subject of the nineteenth century song &quot;D&#x27;ye ken John Peel&quot; - &quot;ken&quot; meaning &#x27;to be aware of&#x27; or &#x27;to know&#x27; in some dialects of the North of England and Scotland.

==Peel&#x27;s life==

Peel was born at Park End, near Caldbeck, Cumberland; his family moved a short time after to the Greenrigg farm. He was baptised on 24 September 1777, but most sources suggest he was born the previous year. Peel married in 1797 to Mary White. Some of the White family&#x27;s property at Ruthwaite (near Ireby) passed into his hands, which secured Peel a comfortable income. However, he was, as many of his friends admitted, prone to dissipation and he devoted himself primarily to hunting. Peel was a farmer by profession, and kept a pack of fox hounds. Peel hunted pine martens and hares in addition to foxes. By the end of his life (13 November 1854, most likely due to a fall while hunting) he had accrued large debts, which his friends helped pay off.

John Peel did occasionally ride to hounds, his mount being a 14 hand dun crossbred gelding named &#x27;Dunny&#x27;. &#x27;Dunny&#x27; would often be abandoned for hours during the hunt when the going became too rough to ride over, standing patiently waiting for his master to return.

Peel&#x27;s niece Nancy Wilson (who was brought up in the Peel household) was also known to hunt with her Uncle John on horseback, &#x27;mounted on a grey pony and garbed in a green habit&#x27;, meaning she rode sidesaddle, which was the proper custom for ladies at the time. But Peel did on many occasions follow the old Cumberland custom, known as &#x27;Chasing the Ace&#x27;, chasing after the hounds on foot.

Peel became a moderately well-known figure, owing to the song written about him. Some of the local gentry, after his death, were glad to take on his sons as servants, and the story of Peel romanticized hunting activities for many. He died in 1854 and is buried in the churchyard of St Kentigern&#x27;s Church, Caldbeck. In 1977 his grave was vandalised by anti-hunting activists.

Peel Region, the equivalent of a county in Ontario, Canada may be named after him.

It is believed that three inns were named after his hounds, &quot;Hark to Towler&quot; at Heywood, &quot;Hark to Bounty&quot; at Slaidburn, and the &quot;Hark to Bellman&quot; Clitheroe. Residents now passed of the area have always understood that John Peel hunted in the Clitheroe district, later arriving by train to Chatburn station, with hounds and horses, and from there to the Bellman Inn (less than 1/2 mile) for a tot of whisky before going hunting. The railway opened in 1850, and the Bellman Inn was granted its first licence in 1826, but was known as the &#x27;ancient hostelry of the Hark to Bellman&#x27; in 1832.

There was also a racecourse very near the Bellman hostelry which ran from at least 1811 to 1839. The hound Bellman was also said to be a completely white hound. John Peel has a fact file in Tullie House Carlisle.

<text>Camilo Nogueira Román (born 22 November 1936) is a Spanish politician and engineer. He was a Member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2004. He was part of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG) and the Democratic Party of the Peoples of Europe, which took part in the Greens–European Free Alliance.

Nogueira finished his studies in industrial engineering in 1964, and graduated with a degree in economics in 1975. He worked as an engineer for Citroën in Vigo between 1964 and 1972. After that he became the Projects and Development Director of the Society for the Industrial Development of Galicia (SODIGA) between 1973 and 1987. Nogueira has always been actively involved in politics.

As a politician, he was a member of the executive board of UPG/ANPG (Galician People&#x27;s Union) from 1970–1977, and member of the executive board of the PSG-EG (Galician Socialist Party) from 1977–1996. He was the leader of Unidade Galega (Galician Unity), a political party which eventually integrated in the BNG coalition. He was a member of the executive board of BNG from 1996 to 1999.

At present he is member of the municipal council of his birth city of Vigo and Deputy in the Galician Parliament representing the BNG.

Nogueira is author of a number of publications on economics and politics in connection with the &quot;Galician Question&quot; (issues related to or having to do with Galicia).

In European Parliament, Camilo Nogueira was very active. His posts while he was a member of the European Parliament were:

* Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Member
* Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Substitute
* Committee on Fisheries, Substitute
* Delegation for relations with the United States, Member

Nogueira made headlines when, following the example of José Posada, he made his oral and written communications in Galician at the European chamber, and this was accepted as a variety of Portuguese. Since then, he has been considered a reintegrationist and was offered honorary membership of the AGAL (Galician Association of the Language), which he accepted.

<doc id="960324" wikidata="Q2471572" url="?curid=960324" title="Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children">
<text>The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children, abbreviated &quot;Pr Azar&quot;, is a passage which appears after Daniel 3:23 in some translations of the Bible, including the ancient Greek Septuagint translation.

The passage is accepted by some Christian denominations as canonical.

The passage includes three main components. The first is the penitential prayer of Daniel&#x27;s friend Azariah (called Abednego in Babylonian, according to ) while the three youths were in the fiery furnace. The second component is a brief account of a radiant figure who met them in the furnace yet who was unburned. The third component is the hymn of praise they sang when they realized their deliverance. The hymn includes the refrain, &quot;Praise and exalt Him above all forever...&quot;, repeated many times, each naming a feature of the world.

==Texts and origin==

The Prayer and accompanying Song are not found in the Hebrew and Aramaic text of the Book of Daniel, nor are they cited in any extant early Jewish writings.

The origins of these writings are obscure. Whether the accounts were originally composed in Hebrew (or Aramaic) or in Greek is uncertain, although many modern scholars conclude on the basis of textual evidence that there was probably an original Semitic edition. The date of composition of these documents is also uncertain, although many scholars favor a date either in the second or first century BC.

== Canonicity ==
It is accepted as canonical scripture by Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians, but rejected by most Protestants as being non-canonical. The passage is included in 80-book Protestant Bibles in the section of the Apocrypha, however. To this end, Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England has it listed as non-canonical (but still, with the other Apocryphal texts, &quot;the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners&quot;). The Belgic Confession of the Reformed Churches teaches that &quot;The church may certainly read these [Apocryphal] books and learn from them as far as they agree with the canonical books.&quot;

<doc id="960328" wikidata="Q1040304" url="?curid=960328" title="Socorro mockingbird">
<text>The Socorro mockingbird (Mimus graysoni) is an endangered mockingbird endemic to Socorro Island in Mexico&#x27;s Revillagigedo Islands. The specific epithet commemorates the American ornithologist Andrew Jackson Grayson.

&quot;Mimus graysoni&quot; shows its close relationship to the northern and tropical mockingbirds rather subtly. It is a much stouter bird, resembling some thrashers in habitus. It also has a distinct juvenile plumage, more rufous above and has a heavy pattern, especially below. This uncannily resembles, e.g., the gray thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma cinereum&quot;) from Baja California, but is apparently a case of convergent evolution.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
This is a rather distinct &quot;Mimus&quot; mockingbird and was for some time placed into a distinct genus, &quot;Mimodes&quot;. This was revealed to be incorrect based on analysis of mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequences.

Rather, the present species is closely related to the northern and tropical mockingbirds. Its distinctiveness is the result of the strong selective pressure on its island home, which enforced the evolution of conspicuous adaptational autapomorphies. The juvenile plumage might also have been the result of genetic drift enforced maybe by resource partitioning in this aggressive bird. The standard model of molecular clocks cannot be applied for mimids as their rates of mutation seem to vary much over time. While it is the most phenotypically distinctive bird on Socorro, it also has the strongest ecological change from its ancestors; therefore its distinctiveness is not informative except supporting the theory that it is one of the older Socorro endemics.

Thus, and because the adaptation to the peculiar conditions on Socorro may even have accelerated not only morphological but also molecular evolution – see also founder effect — it cannot be said with any certainty whether or not among &quot;Mimus&quot;, the Socorro species is a quite recent island offshoot of either of the mainland species. In any case, the three taxa are very close relatives.

==Ecology and status==
The Socorro mockingbird today lives mainly in unmodified low forest above 600 m (2000 ft), where it prefers groves of &quot;Oreopanax xalapensis&quot; and the endemic &quot;Guettarda insularis&quot;, with an understorey dominated by &quot;Triumfetta socorrensis&quot; and the endemic &quot;Eupatorium pacificum&quot;. As late as March 1953 it was still &quot;common&quot; at lower elevations, foraging in arid open shrublands of &quot;Croton masonii&quot; and prickly pear. In November of the same year, the birds had retired to the more humid forest in the uplands and were busy singing and defending territories. Today, they mainly remain in &quot;Ficus cotinifolia&quot; stands when visiting the lower elevations. The breeding season is extended, with nests in attendance between November and July, with the peak laying occurring in March and April. Three eggs are laid, which take no more 15 days to hatch.

The birds are generally reluctant to fly and as late as the mid-20th century were still fatally unwary; if pressed they will rather hop away than fly and if they take wing, it is usually for a few meters only. This may be an adaptation to the fact that Socorro has no native terrestrial predators, but red-tailed hawks and great frigatebirds that not infrequently prey on mockingbird-sized birds.

This species feeds on small invertebrates, the remains of land crabs (&quot;Johngarthia planata&quot;) and fruit, namely of the endemic shrubs &quot;Ilex socorrensis&quot; and &quot;Sideroxylon socorrense&quot;, the latter of which has also become rare. Flies are pecked up but do not seem to be snatched out of the air. Like many Mimidae, the Socorro mockingbird is an aggressive, solitary species living alone or with its partner. When they come together at a plentiful food source – e.g. blowflies on a carcass – there is a marked social hierarchy between birds and rarely are more than two or three actively feeding; the less dominant birds hang around nearby, waiting for their turn.

The call is two medium followed by one lower whistle. Less often, a full song is given, consisting of a variable warbling tune, repeated several times as in many mockingbirds. It is not clear whether this species imitates other birds like its relatives do; in any case only the Socorro tropical parula, Socorro towhee and Socorro wren would seem to possess songs that might serve as models for the mockingbirds, and except the parula these are not often found in the mockingbird&#x27;s core habitat.

===Status and conservation===
This species numbers fewer than 400 individuals altogether and is considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN. &quot;Mimus graysoni&quot; is mostly threatened by habitat loss caused by feral sheep and the locust &quot;Schistocerca piceifrons&quot;, and predation by feral cats which became established after 1953, probably in the early 1970s. It is not believed that the northern mockingbird which has colonized Socorro in the late 20th century is limiting the recovery of its relative; the two &quot;Mimus&quot; do not occupy the same habitat and even if they did, the native bird is larger and more powerful and would probably simply outcompete its mainland relative in native vegetation at least. The extermination of the sheep is underway in the hope of restoring the island ecosystem.

On one hand, it seems that the Socorro mockingbird is a prolific species and would be able to increase in numbers quickly if habitat improves. On the other hand, its terrestrial habits make it vulnerable to cat predation and this may limit its recovery even if sheep are contained; it is not known for example in how far foraging in the lowlands – now cat-ridden – was important for robust breeding success. In addition, it can be expected that predation on this species by both the native red-tailed hawk as well as the feral cats has increased since the Socorro dove – formerly a preferred prey item – has become extinct in the wild. Cerro Evermann, Socorro&#x27;s main volcano, is still active and erupts on a limited scale every few decades; as the mockingbirds seem to depend on upland forest habitat, a major eruption could place the species in jeopardy (see also San Benedicto rock wren). This threat is not considered significant compared to the problem of introduced species however.

<text>George Barris (June 14, 1922 – September 30, 2016) was an American photographer and photojournalist best known for his photographs of actress Marilyn Monroe. He was born in New York City to Romanian parents.

Barris had a lifelong interest in photography, and as a young man he worked for the U.S. Army&#x27;s Office of Public Relations. Many of his photographs of General Dwight D. Eisenhower were published. After the war, he became a freelance photographer and found work in Hollywood. He photographed many stars of the 1950s and 1960s, including Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Cleopatra, Marlon Brando, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Sinatra, Clark Gable and Steve McQueen.

Barris is perhaps best known for his work with Marilyn Monroe, whom he photographed in 1954 on the set of &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, and in 1962 at Santa Monica beach, and in the Hollywood Hills in a series that became known as &quot;The Last Photos.&quot; Barris was collaborating on a book titled &quot;Marilyn: Her Life In Her Own Words&quot; at the time of her death. Barris is well known for taking the last photo of Monroe on July 13, 1962.

Barris died on September 30, 2016, at the age of 94.

<text>Jerrold Lewis Nadler (; born June 13, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician who since 2023 has served as the U.S. representative for , which includes central Manhattan. A member of the Democratic Party, he was first elected to Congress in 1992 to represent the state&#x27;s , which was renumbered as the from 1993 to 2013 and as the from 2013 to 2023. Nadler chaired the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2023. In his 17th term in Congress, Nadler is the dean of New York&#x27;s U.S. House delegation. Before his election to Congress, he served eight terms as a New York State Assemblyman.

== Early life, education, and early political career ==

Nadler was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Miriam () and Emanuel &quot;Max&quot; Nadler. Nadler described his father as a &quot;dyed-in-the-wool Democrat&quot; who lost his poultry farm in New Jersey when the younger Nadler was seven. In his youth, he attended Crown Heights Yeshiva; he is the only member of Congress with a yeshiva education. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1965 (where his debate team partner was the future philosopher of science Alexander Rosenberg, and Dick Morris managed his successful campaign for student government president).

Nadler received his B.A. in 1969 from Columbia University, where he became a brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi. After graduating from Columbia, Nadler worked as a legal assistant and clerk, first with Corporation Trust Company in 1970, then the Morris, Levin and Shein law firm in 1971. In 1972, Nadler was a legislative assistant in the New York State Assembly before becoming shift manager at the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation, a position he held until becoming a law clerk with Morgan, Finnegan, Pine, Foley and Lee in 1976.

While attending evening courses at the Fordham University School of Law, Nadler was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1976. He completed his J.D. at Fordham in 1978.

== New York State Assembly ==

Nadler was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 1992, sitting in the 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th and 189th New York State Legislatures.

In 1985, Nadler ran for Manhattan Borough President. He lost the Democratic primary to David Dinkins. In the general election, he ran as the New York Liberal Party nominee, and again lost to Dinkins.

In 1989, he ran for New York City Comptroller, but lost to Kings County D.A. and former U.S. representative Elizabeth Holtzman in the Democratic primary.

Nadler founded and chaired the Assembly Subcommittee on Mass Transit and Rail Freight.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===

In 1992, Democratic representative Ted Weiss was expected to run for reelection in the 8th district, which had been renumbered from the 17th after the 1990 U.S. Census. However, Weiss died a day before the primary election, and Nadler was nominated to replace Weiss. He ran in two elections on Election Day– a special election to serve the rest of Weiss&#x27;s eighth term in the old 17th district, and a regular election for a full two-year term in the new 8th district. He won both handily, and has been reelected 15 times with very little opposition. In 2020, Nadler faced a primary challenge from activist Lindsey Boylan; the election was the first time in his tenure that Nadler received less than 75% of the vote. The district was renumbered the 10th district after the 2010 Census. A Republican has not represented this district or its predecessors in over a century.

From 2013 to 2023, Nadler&#x27;s 10th district included Manhattan&#x27;s west side from the Upper West Side down to Battery Park, including the World Trade Center; the Manhattan neighborhoods of Chelsea, Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Greenwich Village; and parts of Brooklyn, such as Coney Island, Bensonhurst, Borough Park, and Bay Ridge. It includes many of New York City&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, including the Statue of Liberty, New York Stock Exchange, Brooklyn Bridge and Central Park.

In 2022, Nadler defeated his longtime House colleague Carolyn Maloney in a three-way Democratic primary with 56% of the vote after he and Maloney were both drawn into the during redistricting.

=== Tenure ===

Nadler is the ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and is a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure committees.

Despite earlier efforts to impeach George W. Bush and more recent requests from fellow representatives, he did not schedule hearings on impeachments for Bush or Dick Cheney, saying in 2007 that doing so would be pointless and would distract from the presidential election. In an interview in &quot;Washington Journal&quot; on July 15, 2008, Nadler reiterated the timing argument and endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, saying that electing an honest candidate would create a greater chance of prosecuting those in the Bush administration who had committed war crimes. Ten days later, after Representative Dennis Kucinich submitted articles of impeachment, the full House Judiciary Committee held hearings regarding the process covered solely by C-SPAN. A top Ronald Reagan Justice Department official, Bruce Fein, was among those testifying for impeachment.

On a similar note, referring to hypothetical impeachment proceedings against President Trump that would begin in the newly elected Democrat-controlled House, he suggested a &quot;three-pronged test&quot; that &quot;would make for a legitimate impeachment proceeding&quot;. Such a test would include &quot;the offenses in question must be so grave&quot;, and &quot;the evidence so clear&quot;, that &quot;even some supporters of the president concede that impeachment is necessary&quot;. If it was determined that the president committed an impeachable offense, lawmakers must consider if such an offense would &quot;rise to the gravity where it&#x27;s worth putting the country through the trauma of an impeachment proceeding,&quot; Nadler said.

On September 24, 2019, Representative Lance Gooden proposed a resolution to remove Nadler from his position as chair of the House Judiciary committee, accusing him of unlawfully beginning impeachment proceedings before the House had given the committee authorization.

Nadler served as an impeachment manager (prosecutor) during the first impeachment trial of President Trump.

For his tenure as chair of the House Judiciary Committee in the 116th Congress, Nadler earned an &quot;A&quot; grade from the non-partisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

PolitiFact criticized Nadler for incorrectly claiming following the Kenosha unrest shooting that Kyle Rittenhouse had taken a gun across state lines and might thus be subject to a federal Department of Justice review, when in fact he had not.

Nadler is a member of the Vote Blue Coalition, a progressive group and federal PAC created to support Democrats in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania through voter outreach and mobilization efforts.

== Political positions ==

=== Surveillance ===

Nadler was unhappy with the passage of the surveillance-reform compromise bill, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, saying it &quot;abandons the Constitution&#x27;s protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal scrutiny&quot;.

=== Income taxes ===

Nadler compared Obama&#x27;s acceptance of Republican demands to extend Bush-era tax cuts at the highest income levels to someone&#x27;s being roughed up by the mob, asserting that the Republicans would allow the middle class tax cut only if millionaires and billionaires receive a long-term tax cut as well.

Nadler has proposed changing the income tax brackets to reflect different regions and their costs of living, which would have lowered the tax rate for New Yorkers. He has opposed tax breaks for high-income earners, saying that the country cannot afford it.

=== Abortion ===

Nadler has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.

Nadler sponsored the Freedom of Choice Act in 2004 and 2007. In 2009, he said he might soon re-introduce the bill.

=== LGBT rights ===

Nadler supports same-sex marriage, and anti-discrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

On September 15, 2009, Nadler and two other representatives introduced the Respect for Marriage Act, a proposed bill that would have repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and required the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages.

In 2019, Nadler supported the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

=== Immigration ===

In March 2019, as the House debated President Trump&#x27;s veto of a measure unwinding his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, Nadler said: &quot;I&#x27;m convinced that the president&#x27;s actions are unlawful and deeply irresponsible. A core foundation of our system of government and of democracies across the world, going back hundreds of years, is that the executive cannot unilaterally spend taxpayer money without the legislature&#x27;s consent.&quot;

=== Iran ===

In 2015, Nadler voted to support an agreement to lift economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for Iran&#x27;s compliance with the terms of the agreement which called for substantial dismantling and scaling back of their nuclear program.

=== Israel ===

Of Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December 2017, Nadler said, &quot;I have long recognized Jerusalem as the historic capital of Israel, and have called for the eventual relocation of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, the seat of the Israeli government. While President Trump&#x27;s announcement earlier today rightly acknowledged the unique attachment of the Jewish people to Jerusalem, the timing and circumstances surrounding this decision are deeply worrying.&quot;

=== Housing ===
In 2020, Nadler praised a judge for a ruling that could lead to the removal of 20 or more stories in an already-constructed 52-story luxury high-rise building in the Upper West Side of New York City. The developer had received a permit to construct the building, but the judge said the permit should not have been given.

=== Climate change ===
In April 2023, Nadler was one of the 95 co-sponsors of H.Res.319, which calls for the creation of a Green New Deal.

=== Cannabis ===

Nadler introduced the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act in July 2019 to legalize cannabis at the federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s past time to right this wrong nationwide and work to view marijuana use as an issue of personal choice and public health, not criminal behavior.&quot; In November 2019, the bill passed the House Judiciary Committee by a 24–10 vote, marking the first time that a bill to end cannabis prohibition had ever passed a congressional committee. In April 2022, it passed the full House of Representatives by a 228–164 vote.

=== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ===
Nadler was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

=== Leadership Call To Discuss Biden ===
On July 7, 2024, it was reported that Nadler had expressed interest in Biden dropping out. This was during a call that Hakeem Jeffries held with the committee leaders.

But on July 9, 2024, after a huddle with all the Democrats, Nadler said &quot;he is &#x27;enthusiastically&#x27; supporting Biden.&quot;

=== Voting record ===

Nadler has had a liberal voting record in the House. He gained national prominence during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when he described the process as a &quot;partisan railroad job&quot;.

His Medicare proposal includes a section that provides for a consortium of organization to study Ground Zero illness.

== Personal life ==
Nadler and Josephine Langsdorr &quot;Joyce&quot; Miller wed in 1976. As of 2013, they lived in Lincoln Square.

In 2002 and 2003, Nadler had laparoscopic duodenal switch surgery, helping him lose more than .

<text>José Domingo Posada González (May 9, 1940 – January 14, 2013), of Galicia, Spain, was a member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 1999 and is the president of Galician Coalition (a regionalist political party now integrated in Commitment to Galicia).

Posada came to the spotlight in 1994 as he was the first member of the Parliament to use Galician in his spoken and written communications. This was accepted since Galician was considered to be like Portuguese, which is an official language of the European Union. Since then Posada is considered a reintegrationist.

Today, his processing plant is one of the biggest producers and exporters of Spanish marron glacé. It was established in 1955.

He died on January 14, 2013.

<doc id="960349" wikidata="Q762260" url="?curid=960349" title="Mike Ribeiro">
<text>Michael Tavares Ribeiro (born February 10, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. Originally selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the second round, 45th overall, of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, Ribeiro has played in the NHL for the Canadiens, Dallas Stars, Washington Capitals, Phoenix Coyotes and the Nashville Predators.

==Playing career==
===Amateur===
As a youth, Ribeiro played in the 1993 and 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

===Montreal Canadiens, Dallas Stars===

Ribeiro was drafted 45th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the second round of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. On September 30, 2006, the Canadiens traded Ribeiro and a sixth-round draft pick in 2008 to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Janne Niinimaa and a fifth-round draft pick in 2007.

In the 2006–07 season, Ribeiro led Dallas in points, with 59. On July 12, the Stars signed Ribeiro to a one-year, $2.8 million contract extension for the 2007–08 season.

On January 7, 2008, Ribeiro and the Stars agreed to a new five-year, $25 million contract extension. Ribeiro went on to establish career highs in goals (27), assists (56) and points (83) that season and earned his first NHL All-Star Game appearance.

The 2008–09 season also saw Ribeiro breakout in the shootout, particularly with highlight reel performances in games against the Los Angeles Kings and the Colorado Avalanche.

===Washington Capitals===

On June 22, 2012, during the 2012 NHL Entry Draft and in the final year of his contract, Ribeiro was traded to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Cody Eakin and a 2012 second-round draft pick (54th overall). Alongside the likes of Alexander Ovechkin and Nicklas Bäckström on the Washington roster, Ribeiro scored prolifically with the Capitals, averaging over a point-per-game with 49 in 48 games.

===Phoenix Coyotes===
On July 2, 2013, seeking a long-term deal, the Capitals opted to allow Ribeiro to become an unrestricted free agent. On July 5, the Phoenix Coyotes then signed the free agent Ribeiro to a four-year, $22 million contract with a limited no-movement clause, re-uniting him with his former head coach whilst with the Stars, Dave Tippett. In his first season with the Coyotes in 2013–14, however, Ribeiro failed to reproduce his scoring pace of the previous year, scoring 16 goals and 47 points in 80 games.

===Nashville Predators===
On June 27, 2014, Ribeiro was bought-out by the Coyotes after only the first year of his four-year contract due to behavioural issues related to alcohol use. Weeks later, on July 15, Ribeiro signed a one-year, $1.05 million contract as an unrestricted free agent with the Nashville Predators.

On July 1, 2015, after a 2014–15 season in which he scored 15 goals and 47 assists for 62 points to finish second on the Predators in scoring, Ribeiro signed a two-year, $7 million contract extension with Nashville, thereby avoiding free agency.

In the second year of his contract extension, Ribeiro struggled to keep up his play, scoring just 4 goals in 46 games before being placed on waivers by the Predators on February 2. After going unclaimed, Ribeiro was assigned to the Milwaukee Admirals, the Predators&#x27; AHL affiliate. Ribeiro briefly considered retirement, but ultimately decided to report to the Admirals.

Ribeiro had battled alcoholism throughout his career in the NHL, and amidst reports that he had relapsed, his agent subsequently stated &quot;There is not a single NHL or even European team that has called me to inquire about his services.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ribeiro has three children (Mikael, Noah and Viktoria) with his ex-wife Tamara. Their divorce was finalized in September 2021 in Williamson County Tennessee. He is of Portuguese descent.

In 2014, Ribeiro faced charges from his former nanny that he forcibly sexually assaulted her at their Virginia residence. In 2017, Ribeiro settled the case out of court.

In 2024, Ribeiro went on trial for two counts of sexual assault and a count of attempted sexual assault, stemming from incidents at Lake Cypress Springs, Texas in 2021. He was found not guilty on two counts and the third deadlocked the jury resulting in a mistrial.

<doc id="960361" wikidata="Q7833965" url="?curid=960361" title="Transduction (machine learning)">
<text>In logic, statistical inference, and supervised learning,
transduction or transductive inference is reasoning from
observed, specific (training) cases to specific (test) cases. In contrast,
induction is reasoning from observed training cases
to general rules, which are then applied to the test cases. The distinction is
most interesting in cases where the predictions of the transductive model are
not achievable by any inductive model. Note that this is caused by transductive
inference on different test sets producing mutually inconsistent predictions.

Transduction was introduced in a computer science context by Vladimir Vapnik in the 1990s, motivated by
his view that transduction is preferable to induction since, according to him, induction requires
solving a more general problem (inferring a function) before solving a more
specific problem (computing outputs for new cases): &quot;When solving a problem of
interest, do not solve a more general problem as an intermediate step. Try to
get the answer that you really need but not a more general one.&quot;.

An example of learning which is not inductive would be in the case of binary
classification, where the inputs tend to cluster in two groups. A large set of
test inputs may help in finding the clusters, thus providing useful information
about the classification labels. The same predictions would not be obtainable
from a model which induces a function based only on the training cases. Some
people may call this an example of the closely related semi-supervised learning, since Vapnik&#x27;s motivation is quite different. 
The most well-known example of a case-bases learning algorithm is the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which is related to transductive learning algorithms.
Another example of an algorithm in this category is the Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM).

A third possible motivation of transduction arises through the need
to approximate. If exact inference is computationally prohibitive, one may at
least try to make sure that the approximations are good at the test inputs. In
this case, the test inputs could come from an arbitrary distribution (not
necessarily related to the distribution of the training inputs), which wouldn&#x27;t
be allowed in semi-supervised learning. An example of an algorithm falling in
this category is the Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM).

==Historical Context==
The mode of inference from particulars to particulars, which Vapnik came to call transduction, was already distinguished from the mode of inference from particulars to generalizations in part III of the Cambridge philosopher and logician W.E. Johnson&#x27;s 1924 textbook, &quot;Logic&quot;. In Johnson&#x27;s work, the former mode was called &#x27;eduction&#x27; and the latter was called &#x27;induction&#x27;. Bruno de Finetti developed a purely subjective form of Bayesianism in which claims about objective chances could be translated into empirically respectable claims about subjective credences with respect to observables through exchangeability properties. An early statement of this view can be found in his 1937 &quot;La Prévision: ses Lois Logiques, ses Sources Subjectives&quot; and a mature statement in his 1970 &quot;Theory of Probability&quot;. Within de Finetti&#x27;s subjective Bayesian framework, all inductive inference is ultimately inference from particulars to particulars.

==Example problem==

The following example problem contrasts some of the unique properties of transduction against induction.

A collection of points is given, such that some of the points are labeled (A, B, or C), but most of the points are unlabeled (?). The goal is to predict appropriate labels for all of the unlabeled points.

The inductive approach to solving this problem is to use the labeled points to train a supervised learning algorithm, and then have it predict labels for all of the unlabeled points. With this problem, however, the supervised learning algorithm will only have five labeled points to use as a basis for building a predictive model. It will certainly struggle to build a model that captures the structure of this data. For example, if a nearest-neighbor algorithm is used, then the points near the middle will be labeled &quot;A&quot; or &quot;C&quot;, even though it is apparent that they belong to the same cluster as the point labeled &quot;B&quot;, compare semi-supervised learning.

Transduction has the advantage of being able to consider all of the points, not just the labeled points, while performing the labeling task. In this case, transductive algorithms would label the unlabeled points according to the clusters to which they naturally belong. The points in the middle, therefore, would most likely be labeled &quot;B&quot;, because they are packed very close to that cluster.

An advantage of transduction is that it may be able to make better predictions with fewer labeled points, because it uses the natural breaks found in the unlabeled points. One disadvantage of transduction is that it builds no predictive model. If a previously unknown point is added to the set, the entire transductive algorithm would need to be repeated with all of the points in order to predict a label. This can be computationally expensive if the data is made available incrementally in a stream. Further, this might cause the predictions of some of the old points to change (which may be good or bad, depending on the application). A supervised learning algorithm, on the other hand, can label new points instantly, with very little computational cost.

==Transduction algorithms==

Transduction algorithms can be broadly divided into two categories: those that seek to assign discrete labels to unlabeled points, and those that seek to regress continuous labels for unlabeled points. Algorithms that seek to predict discrete labels tend to be derived by adding partial supervision to a clustering algorithm. Two classes of algorithms can be used: flat clustering and hierarchical clustering. The latter can be further subdivided into two categories: those that cluster by partitioning, and those that cluster by agglomerating. Algorithms that seek to predict continuous labels tend to be derived by adding partial supervision to a manifold learning algorithm.

===Partitioning transduction===

Partitioning transduction can be thought of as top-down transduction. It is a semi-supervised extension of partition-based clustering. It is typically performed as follows:

 Consider the set of all points to be one large partition.
 While any partition P contains two points with conflicting labels:
 Partition P into smaller partitions.
 For each partition P:
 Assign the same label to all of the points in P.

Of course, any reasonable partitioning technique could be used with this algorithm. Max flow min cut partitioning schemes are very popular for this purpose.

===Agglomerative transduction===

Agglomerative transduction can be thought of as bottom-up transduction. It is a semi-supervised extension of agglomerative clustering. It is typically performed as follows:

 Compute the pair-wise distances, D, between all the points.
 Sort D in ascending order.
 Consider each point to be a cluster of size 1.
 For each pair of points {a,b} in D:
 If (a is unlabeled) or (b is unlabeled) or (a and b have the same label)
 Merge the two clusters that contain a and b.
 Label all points in the merged cluster with the same label.

===Manifold transduction===

Manifold-learning-based transduction is still a very young field of research.

<text>Peter Thomas King (born April 5, 1944) is an American former politician and novelist who represented New York in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1993 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, he represented a South Shore Long Island district that includes parts of Nassau County and Suffolk County and was numbered as the 3rd and later the 2nd district.

King was formerly chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security. He stepped down because of Republican conference term limits, but remained a member of the committee. On November 11, 2019, King announced he would not seek re-election in the 2020 elections and would retire after his current term expired. He resigned from the Financial Services Committee on January 15, 2020. King also previously served on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

King&#x27;s professional papers are held at the University of Notre Dame Archives.

==Early life, family, education and military career==
King was born in the New York City borough of Manhattan and raised in the Sunnyside neighborhood in nearby Queens. He is the son of Ethel M. King (née Gittins) and Peter E. King, a New York City police officer. His paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants from the island of Inishbofin in County Galway. His maternal grandfather was Welsh, and his maternal grandmother was also Irish, from County Limerick.

He graduated from St. Francis College in 1965 with a B.A. in political science, and earned his J.D. from Notre Dame Law School in 1968. That same year, he began service in the 165th Infantry Regiment of the New York Army National Guard. He worked for the Nassau County district attorney&#x27;s office until 1974, when he was honorably discharged from the 165th infantry regiment.

King and his wife, Rosemary, reside in Seaford, New York, and have two adult children. His daughter, Erin King Sweeney, served on the town council for Hempstead, New York.

King is Roman Catholic.

==Political career==
King first sought public office in 1977, running for an at-large seat on the Hempstead, New York town council and winning with the backing of the then-powerful Nassau County Republican Party machine led by Joseph Margiotta. In 1981, he successfully ran for Nassau county comptroller, again with Margiotta&#x27;s support. The next year, when several prominent Republican politicians, led by then senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, sought to displace Margiotta, King joined them in this internal Republican dispute; at one point, he was the only Nassau politician to do so. King was re-elected in 1985 and 1989. As comptroller, he displayed independence, often criticizing the budget proposals of county executives Francis Purcell and Thomas Gulotta, both Republicans.

King ran for attorney general of New York in 1986, and won the Republican primary after Ulster County District Attorney E. Michael Kavanagh dropped out to run for lieutenant governor. However, he was defeated by a large margin by incumbent Democratic attorney general Robert Abrams.

King was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992. When Democratic Party Rep. Robert Mrazek announced his short-lived 1992 U.S. Senate candidacy against Republican incumbent Al D&#x27;Amato, King ran for the 3rd district congressional seat that had been held by Mrazek. Despite being outspent 5-to-1, King won 49.6% to 46.5%. From 1993 to 2008, he sometimes faced only token opposition, while in other races, he ran against candidates who could self-finance their campaigns. Although King was outspent in those races, he won by double-digit margins.

In 2006, Nassau county legislator Dave Mejias challenged King. While some pundits believed this race would be close due to dissatisfaction with George W. Bush, King defeated Mejias 56% to 44%. King again sought re-election to Congress in 2008. The Democrats fielded 25-year-old newcomer Graham Long in a long-shot bid to defeat King. King won the 2008 election with 64% of the vote.

In 2013, St. John&#x27;s University honored King with a Doctor of Laws degree, and he gave their commencement address. He was recognized for assisting New York City following Hurricane Sandy.

===Potential bids for U.S. Senate and presidency===

King had contemplated running for Senate in 2000 against Hillary Clinton, and even created an exploratory committee in 2003 to challenge Chuck Schumer. On both occasions he ultimately decided not to pursue the challenge.

After briefly contemplating running for governor of New York in 2010, King announced that he was seriously considering running for U.S. Senate in a special election for the last two years of the term won in 2006 by Hillary Clinton, who had been appointed U.S. secretary of state. When Kirsten Gillibrand, the representative of New York&#x27;s 20th congressional district, was appointed to fill the seat by David Paterson, King initially said he would consider holding off on making a run for the seat. However, two days after the Gillibrand pick, King demanded Paterson justify his selection of the congresswoman, saying there were more qualified candidates. In August 2009, King ruled out a Senate run; however, in January 2010, he said he was reconsidering a run. King ultimately decided to run for re-election, which he won with 72% of the vote.
During a 2013 radio interview in New Hampshire, King said that he was in the state &quot;because right now I&#x27;m running for president,&quot; for the 2016 election. However, during a March 2014 CNN interview, King said he was considering running, not actively running. In a July 2015 interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, King announced he would not be running for president. King had earlier characterized a potential candidacy as being opposed to potential Tea Party movement candidates such as Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, whom he criticized for their national defense policies. He later opposed Republican efforts to tie the repeal of delay of the Affordable Care Act to a continuing resolution before and during the 2013 government shutdown.

==Political positions and statements==

King was ranked as the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the U.S. Congress by the frequency by which each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party. He was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. In 2010, when Charles Rangel of New York was censured for ethical violations, King, along with Alaska Representative Don Young, were the only two Republicans voting against.

Although he supported John McCain for president in 2000, and despite his earlier disagreements with George W. Bush, King later became a Bush supporter. He opposed McCain&#x27;s calls for an end to coercive interrogation methods used with suspected terrorists, as well as the senator&#x27;s 2007 effort to enact a path to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants.

On April 19, 2016, King stated that he would &quot;take cyanide&quot; should Ted Cruz ever win the Republican nomination for president, stating:

The animosity stemmed from the Texas senator not supporting a 9/11-related healthcare bill for police and firefighters, and a statement from Cruz that New York values are socially liberal.

King, like all 195 Republican members of the House present, voted against both articles of impeachment against Donald Trump during Trump&#x27;s first impeachment in 2019.

=== Economy ===
King voted for the 2008 Wall Street bailout, saying it was &quot;necessary for the financial health of New York and his district.&quot; He opposed the 2009 economic stimulus package.

King was one of five New York Republicans in the House to vote against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He voted against it due to the $10,000 cap the bill would impose on the deductibility of state, local, and property taxes and the impact that would have in New York, a high-tax state. Upon the possibility of a second round of cuts, King reiterated he would be &quot;forced to oppose&quot; more tax cuts if legislation included a provision &quot;permanently extending the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction&quot;. Only twelve Republican members of Congress in total voted against the bill.

===Labor issues===
King was considered a pro-union Republican. At times, King was highly critical of his party&#x27;s leadership for being, in his view, &quot;anti-union.&quot; During his time in Congress, King&#x27;s voting record was significantly more pro-labor than most members of his party. In 2019, the AFL-CIO gave King a score of 55%; compared to a House Republican average of 31% for that same year. King holds a lifetime score of 54%. 2019 marked the first time since 2010 (when King scored the GOP average of 7%) that King&#x27;s score was not at least double the Republican average.

=== Guns ===
King is pro-gun control. He cites his support of gun control based on his experiences in New York, &quot;Virtually every time there&#x27;s a murder in New York, the gun tracked comes from another state,&quot; he states, expressing that without stricter gun control, people in New York will get killed.

King authored legislation to close what is known as the &quot;terror gap,&quot; which would ban individuals on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns. He also supports the banning of bump stocks, in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. He describes the banning of bump stocks as being &quot;morally, legally, and common sense-wise the right thing to do.&quot;

King supports expanding background checks for commercial gun sales (including at gun shows), and co-sponsored a bipartisan bill on this issue with Mike Thompson in 2013.

The NRA Political Victory Fund gave King a rating of D in 2014, falling to an &quot;F&quot; in 2016.

===Health care===
On May 4, 2017, King voted in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with the American Health Care Act.

=== House Intelligence Committee ===
King was a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. In 2018, he voted to release the Nunes memo, written by Committee staff at the request of Republican Committee Chairman U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, over the objections of senior FBI leaders and all Democratic members of the committee. The memo states that the FBI &quot;may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources&quot; to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant on Trump adviser Carter Page in October 2016, and in three subsequent renewals, during the early phases of the FBI&#x27;s investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

At the time Trump asserted that the memo discredited the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. The FBI was asserted that &quot;material omissions of fact ... fundamentally impact the memo&#x27;s accuracy.&quot;

===Irish republicanism and the IRA===

King began actively supporting the Irish republican movement in the late 1970s. He frequently traveled to Northern Ireland to meet with senior members of the paramilitary group, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), many of whom he counted as friends. King compared Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Féin, the political wing of the Irish republican movement, to George Washington, and said that the &quot;British government is a murder machine&quot;. King met Adams in person in 1984.

King became involved with Irish Northern Aid (NORAID), an organization that the British, Irish, and U.S. governments had accused of financing IRA activities and providing them with weapons. Regarding the IRA&#x27;s violent campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, King said, &quot;If civilians are killed in an attack on a military installation, it is certainly regrettable, but I will not morally blame the IRA for it.&quot;

King called the IRA &quot;the legitimate voice of occupied Ireland&quot;. Speaking at a pro-IRA rally in 1982 in Nassau County, New York, King pledged support to &quot;those brave men and women who this very moment are carrying forth the struggle against British imperialism in the streets of Belfast and Derry.&quot; In 1985, the Irish government boycotted New York&#x27;s annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations in protest over King serving as Grand Marshal of the event; the Irish government condemned him as an &quot;avowed&quot; supporter of &quot;IRA terrorism&quot;. At the parade he again offered words of support for the IRA.

During the murder trial of an IRA member in the 1980s, a judge in Northern Ireland ejected King from the courtroom, describing King as &quot;an obvious collaborator with the IRA&quot;.

In 1993, King lobbied unsuccessfully for Gerry Adams to be a guest at the presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton. King was a go-between during the Northern Ireland peace process, and has said the IRA was a &quot;legitimate force that had to be recognized&quot; to have peace.

In 2002, King denounced congressional investigation of the IRA-FARC links in the Colombia Three case.

Although disgruntled by Sinn Féin&#x27;s opposition to the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq, King supported bail in 2008 for an IRA Maze escapee, Pól Brennan. Brennan was facing charges for illegally entering the U.S. and was deported to the Republic of Ireland in April 2009.

In a 2005 interview, King said he had &quot;cooled on Ireland&quot;, blaming an epidemic of what he called &quot;knee-jerk anti-Americanism&quot; that swept through Ireland after the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. &quot;I don&#x27;t buy that it&#x27;s just anti-Bush. There&#x27;s a certain unpleasant trait that the Irish have, and it&#x27;s begrudgery ... and resentment towards the Americans.&quot; King said he had turned down an offer from the Obama administration to be the US ambassador to Ireland in 2009. At a September 2011 hearing conducted by the UK Parliament&#x27;s Home Affairs Select Committee as part of its &quot;Roots of Violent Radicalisation&quot; inquiry, King defended his 1985 &quot;If civilians are killed&quot; remarks and extolled his role in the peace process as an &quot;honest mediator&quot;. His office cited Congressional Research Service and House of Commons researchers noting that King became the first member of Congress to testify before a UK parliamentary hearing.

In 2011, King said that his ties to the IRA had been &quot;entirely distorted&quot;, arguing that if the accusations were true then &quot;I doubt the president of the United States would have offered me the position of ambassador to Ireland.&quot;

===Islam===
King has faced criticism over concerns of his treatment and views towards the civil rights of minority communities, especially that of Muslim Americans. Some observers have credited King with demonizing Muslim Americans and giving political influence towards anti-Muslim views and activism.
During the 1990s, King enjoyed a close relationship with the Muslim community in his congressional district. King often gave speeches at the Islamic Center of Long Island in Westbury, NY, held book signings in the prayer hall, hired Muslim interns, and was one of the few Republicans who supported U.S. intervention in the 1990s to help Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Muslim community thanked King for his work by making him the guest of honor for the 1993 opening of a $3 million prayer hall. For years, a picture of King cutting the ceremonial ribbon hung on the bulletin board by the mosque&#x27;s entrance.

In a September 2007 interview with the website &quot;Politico.com&quot;, King said &quot;There are too many mosques in this country ... There are too many people sympathetic to radical Islam. We should be looking at them more carefully and finding out how we can infiltrate them.&quot; King later said he meant to say that too many mosques in the United States do not cooperate with law enforcement.

In late 2016, King suggested to Donald Trump that a federal program be formed aimed at surveilling the activities of American Muslims.

===National security===
King supported the Iraq War. King supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s order to kill Osama bin Laden, saying that he knew it was a &quot;tough decision&quot; to make in the situation room. He also approved of Obama&#x27;s surprise trip to Afghanistan in May 2012.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2006 that King had been &quot;the Patriot Act&#x27;s most fervent fan.&quot; In 2008, King told the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Look, we have not been attacked in seven years and it&#x27;s not because of luck.&quot;

Since 2009, King has argued against holding terrorist trials in New York City, saying that enormous security risks and financial costs would accompany the public trials. In April 2011, he called for attorney general Eric Holder to resign due to Holder&#x27;s plans to transfer Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged co-conspirators in the September 11, 2001, attacks from Guantanamo to New York City for trials in U.S. federal court. King denounced Holder&#x27;s plan &quot;as the most irresponsible decision ever made by any attorney general.&quot;

King continued to challenge Holder in April 2011, demanding to know why the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), its co-founder Omar Ahmad, the Islamic Society of North America, the North American Islamic Trust, and other unindicted &quot;co-conspirators&quot; in the Holy Land Foundation &quot;terrorism financing&quot; trial, were not being prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice. In a letter to Holder, King wrote he had recently learned that the decision had been made by high-ranking Justice Department officials &quot;over the vehement and stated objections of special agents and supervisors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the prosecutors at the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office in Dallas&quot;, adding that &quot;there should be full transparency into the Department&#x27;s decision.&quot; Holder responded that the decision not to prosecute had been made during the Bush administration. The U.S. attorney in Dallas said he alone had been responsible for the decision, which had been made based on an analysis of the law and the evidence, with no political pressure involved.

In December 2009, King commented on reports that accused attempted airline bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had admitted to being trained and equipped in Yemen and on then pending plans to release several Guantanamo prisoners to Yemen: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Guantanamo should be closed, but if we&#x27;re going to close it I don&#x27;t believe we should be sending people to Yemen where prisoners have managed to escape in the past . ... Obviously, if [Abdulmutallab] did get training and direction from Yemen, it just adds to what is already a dangerous situation&quot;, he said.

King criticized the activities of WikiLeaks and in December 2010 suggested that the group be designated a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; and treated as such by U.S. agencies. In 2011, King became a co-sponsor of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). He praised Obama&#x27;s nominations of Leon Panetta for United States Secretary of Defense and David Petraeus for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, saying, &quot;Director Panetta has done an outstanding job at the CIA, and General Petraeus has distinguished himself as one of the great American military leaders. Both men ... will be instrumental as we continue to combat the terrorist threat.&quot; On June 11, 2013, King stated that Edward Snowden should be punished for releasing classified information to the American public, and added that journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras should also be punished for publishing classified documents provided by Snowden. On June 12, 2013, on Fox News, King called for prosecution of Greenwald, alleging that the journalist was said to be in possession of names of CIA agents around the world and would be &quot;threatening to disclose&quot; them. Via Twitter, Greenwald immediately refuted King&#x27;s claim and called it a &quot;blatant lie&quot;.

King suggested in 2014 that &quot;foreign policy was not a major issue&quot; for Obama, as he had worn a light tan suit in August in Washington the day before. He also said that &quot;There&#x27;s no way any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday&quot; in reference to wearing the light tan suit as he addressed the media.

King and Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) asked Congress on March 11, 2015, to make anthrax vaccines that are about to expire and otherwise would be disposed of available to emergency responders. They made their request in a letter to fellow members of Congress shortly after King introduced the bill (H.R. 1300) on March 4, 2015. King previously introduced the bill in September 2014, but it was not enacted.

King supported Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration to the United States from some Muslim-majority countries until better screening methods are devised. He stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t think the Constitution applies to people coming in from outside the country, especially if there is a logical basis for it.&quot;

===Radicalization hearings===

In December 2010, King announced that, when he became chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, he would hold hearings on the alleged radicalization of some American Muslims. While allowing that, &quot;The overwhelming majority of Muslims are outstanding citizens,&quot; he claimed some Islamic clerics were telling their congregations to ignore extremism and to refrain from helping government investigators. King cited Justice Department statistics showing that, over the previous two years, 50 U.S. citizens had been charged with major acts of terrorism and that all were motivated by radical Islamic ideologies.

The first hearing, held on March 10, 2011, was entitled &quot;The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and that Community&#x27;s Response.&quot; The hearing included testimony from congressmen John D. Dingell of Michigan, Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who was one of two Muslims in the U.S. Congress at the time, Frank Wolf (R-VA), and Los Angeles county sheriff Leroy Baca.

Others to provide testimony included Dr. M Zuhdi Jasser, a secular Muslim and founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy; Melvin Bledsoe, whose son Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, a Muslim convert, is serving a life sentence for killing a soldier and wounding another in the 2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting; and Abdirizak Bihi, the Director of the Somali Education and Social Advocacy Center. The Council on American Islamic Relations submitted a statement to the committee.

In an article for the &quot;National Review&quot;, King announced that his second and third Homeland Security Committee hearings on radicalization would focus on foreign money coming into American mosques and al Shabab&#x27;s efforts to recruit young Muslim men in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The second hearing was set for mid-May while the third was tentatively scheduled for July. King stated he would continue to hold radicalization hearings as long as he is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.

====Reactions====
Bennie Thompson (D-MS), the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, responded by saying that &quot;none of these law enforcement and intelligence officials have backed King&#x27;s assertions that the Muslim community has not been helpful in thwarting terrorist attacks.&quot; Thompson wrote King, demanding that the scope of the hearings be widened to include all extremist groups in the United States, irrespective of ideology or religion.

Los Angeles County sheriff Lee Baca said there was nothing to support King&#x27;s claims of non-cooperation by American Muslims, and invited King to Los Angeles to show the reported cooperation between Muslim-Americans and federal law enforcement. The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), in a letter to King, claimed that his call was sweeping and misguided and called for a meeting with him to discuss his initiatives, the proposed hearings, and the efforts of the Muslim American community to fight radicalization.

The Council on American Islamic Relations joined fifty other activist and Human Rights organizations, including Amnesty International, the Sikh Coalition, the Japanese American Citizens League and Unitarian Universalist Service Committee in signing a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), comparing the hearings to those held by Senator Joe McCarthy in the 1950s and calling them &quot;divisive and wrong&quot;, and &quot;an affront to fundamental [American] freedoms&quot;

Seema Jilani, a freelance journalist writing an opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described King as &quot;America&#x27;s new McCarthy&quot;, who was instigating &quot;a bigoted witchhunt.&quot;

Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the conservative religious organization American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), which opposed the building of the Park51 Community Center, declared his support for King and the hearings and remarked, &quot;This hearing isn&#x27;t about profiling — it&#x27;s about protecting our homeland.&quot;

Frank Gaffney, founder and president of the American Center for Security Policy, praised King for holding a hearing &quot;about an issue that has long been deemed politically untouchable&quot; and opined that King had indeed shown there is &quot;a problem of &#x27;extremism&#x27; within the American Muslim community.&quot; Several members of Congress, including Representatives Mike Rogers and Joe Walsh, wrote letters of support for King&#x27;s hearings. Rogers wrote that radicalization could happen anywhere in the United States, and thus it is an issue all Americans have to deal with. Walsh added that &quot;Homegrown terrorists are the number one threat facing American families right now, and it would be irresponsible and negligent not to try and identify the causes of their radicalization.&quot;

=== Social issues ===
====LGBT rights====
In the 114th Congress, King had a score of 4 out of 100 from the Human Rights Campaign for his voting record on LGBT rights issues. He does not support same-sex marriage and opposed the Supreme Court taking on the landmark &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; case.

====Abortion====
King identifies as &quot;pro-life.&quot; While in Congress, King consistently received a score of 0%, from NARAL-Pro Choice America, an abortion rights organization. When asked at the Republican National Convention in 2012, King said, &quot;[The] main purpose of government is to protect innocent life, no matter where that life is.&quot; In the same interview, King said a woman should not be punished for getting an abortion but doctors who perform the procedure should be.

====Marijuana====
King had a &quot;C&quot; rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He has twice voted against providing veterans access to medical marijuana via the Veterans Health Administration.

===Criticism of Occupy Wall Street===
King was harshly critical of the Occupy Wall Street movement from the beginning; commenting on October 7, 2011:

King supported New York City mayor Bloomberg&#x27;s decision to have the NYPD forcibly evict the Occupy protestors from Manhattan&#x27;s Zuccotti Park; calling them, &quot;low life dirtbags&quot; and &quot;losers&quot;, who &quot;live in dirt.&quot; Bloomberg received widespread bipartisan support for the removal.

===Noteworthy statements===
On July 5, 2009, shortly after the death of Michael Jackson, King made a video statement chiding the media for its coverage of Jackson&#x27;s death:

King&#x27;s statement generated national media coverage. In reaction to the controversy, King said, &quot;I believe I&#x27;m articulating the views of a great majority of the American people&quot;.

Responding to the 2014 death of Eric Garner by police, King said, &quot;If he had not had asthma, and a heart condition, and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died from this.&quot;

In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, King posted on Facebook that it was a &quot;vicious Islamic terrorist attack&quot; and said the &quot;Islamic threat to the United States is greater than at any time since 9/11.&quot; He proceeded to then critique &quot;leftwing editors at the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the liberal ideologies&quot; of the American Civil Liberties Union, saying both the newspaper and the organization were attempting to &quot;intimidate&quot; critics of radical Islam.

On May 26, 2018, responding to the owner of the New York Jets supporting the right of National Football League players to kneel in protest during the national anthem, King likened the protest to that of &quot;Nazi salutes&quot;

His novel &quot;The Way West&quot; won the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and his screenplay for &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) was nominated for an Academy Award.

==Biography==
Guthrie was born in 1901 in Bedford, Indiana. When he was six months old he relocated with his parents to Montana, where his father became the first principal of the Teton County Free High School in Choteau. His father was a graduate of Indiana University, his mother from Earlham College at Richmond, Indiana.

A constant reader, Guthrie tried to write while in high school, &quot;fiction pretty much, some essays, but I majored in journalism. My father had been a newspaper man for four years in this little town in Kentucky, and I guess he thought it was the way to become a writer&quot;.:3

In 1919, Guthrie studied at the University of Washington for a year, then transferred to the University of Montana, where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and graduated with a degree in journalism with honors in 1923. He worked odd jobs for the next few years.

In 1926, Guthrie took out a $300 bank loan and moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where he took a job at the &quot;Lexington Leader&quot; newspaper. For the next 21 years he worked as a reporter, the city editor, and an editorial writer for the &quot;Leader&quot;. Guthrie published his first novel &quot;Murders at Moon Dance&quot; in 1943.

In 1944, while still at the &quot;Leader&quot;, Guthrie won the Nieman Fellowship from Harvard, and spent the year at the university studying writing. While at Harvard he made friends with English professor Theodore Morrison, &quot;who knew so much about writing, probably more than I ever will.&quot;:3 Morrison mentored Guthrie and helped him transition from journalism to fiction.

During his year at Harvard Guthrie began his novel &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, which was published in 1947. Guthrie later wrote, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until I went to Harvard that I got in gear. Then I went back and worked for the newspaper for another year or so.&quot;:4

At the &quot;Lexington Leader&quot; Guthrie&#x27;s boss was very understanding and as long as Guthrie performed his news duties satisfactorily he was allowed to take his afternoons off to write fiction.:18 After publication of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; Guthrie left the paper and supported himself by teaching creative writing at University of Kentucky. During this time he published &quot;The Way West&quot; which won the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. He quit teaching in 1952 to devote his full-time to writing, and moved back to Choteau, Montana, because he said it was his &quot;point of outlook on the universe&quot;. He split his residence between Choteau and Great Falls, Montana, an hour away from Choteau.

Guthrie continued to write predominantly western subjects. He worked for a time in Hollywood, writing the screenplays for &quot;Shane&quot; (1953, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award) and &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; (1955).

His other books included &quot;These Thousand Hills&quot; (1956), &quot;The Blue Hen&#x27;s Chick&quot; (1965), &quot;Arfive&quot; (1970), &quot;The Last Valley&quot; (1975), &quot;Fair Land, Fair Land&quot; (1982), &quot;Murder in the Cotswolds&quot; (1989), and &quot;A Field Guide to Writing Fiction&quot; (1991). His first collection of short stories, &quot;The Big It and Other Stories&quot;, was published in 1960.

Guthrie died in 1991, at age 90, at his ranch near Choteau.

<doc id="960381" wikidata="Q280481" url="?curid=960381" title="Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album is an award presented to recording artists at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award has been presented every year since 1992, though it has had two name changes throughout its history. In 1992 the award was known as Best Traditional Pop Performance, from 1993 to 2000 the award was known as Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance, and since 2001 it has been awarded as Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. Apart from the first year it was presented, the award has been designated for &quot;albums containing 51% or more playing time of vocal tracks&quot;, with &quot;traditional&quot; referring to the &quot;composition, vocal styling, and the instrumental arrangement&quot; of the body of music known as the Great American Songbook.

The 1992 award was presented to Natalie Cole for the spliced-together duet of her and her father, Nat King Cole, performing his original recording of &quot;Unforgettable&quot;. This is the only instance in which the traditional pop award was awarded for a song, as opposed to an album. Prior to 2001, the Grammy was presented to the performing artists only; since then the award has been given to the performing artists, the engineers/mixers, as well as the producers, provided they worked on more than 51 percent of playing time on the album. Producers and engineers who worked on &quot;less&quot; than 50 percent of playing time of the album, as well as mastering engineers do not win an award, but can apply for a Winners Certificate. However, the lead performing artist remains the only one to receive an official nomination. Eligibility criteria for the category was expanded in 2025 to welcome more entries from the musical theater community, and it was mandated that albums must contain more than 75% of newly recorded and previously unreleased material.

<doc id="960392" wikidata="Q1226282" url="?curid=960392" title="MacKinlay Kantor">
<text>MacKinlay Kantor (February 4, 1904 – October 11, 1977), born Benjamin McKinlay Kantor, was an American journalist, novelist and screenwriter. He wrote more than 30 novels, several set during the American Civil War, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1956 for his 1955 novel, &quot;Andersonville&quot;. He also wrote the novel &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, set during the Civil War.

==Early life and education==
Kantor was born and grew up in Webster City, Iowa, with his older sister, Virginia. His mother, Effie (McKinlay) Kantor, worked as the editor of the &quot;Webster City Daily News&quot; during part of his childhood. His father, John Martin Kantor, was a native-born Swedish Jew descended from &quot;a long line of rabbis, who posed as a Protestant clergyman&quot;. His mother was of English, Irish, Scottish, and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. (Later, MacKinlay Kantor wrote an unpublished novel called &quot;Half Jew&quot;.) 

Kantor&#x27;s father had trouble keeping jobs and abandoned the family before Kantor was born. His mother returned to her parents in Webster City, Mr. and Mrs. Adam McKinlay, to live at their home with her children.

As a child, the boy started using his middle name McKinlay as his given name. He changed its spelling, adding an &quot;a&quot;, because he thought it sounded more Scottish, and chose to be called &quot;Mack&quot; or MacKinlay. He attended the local schools and described the Kendall Young Public Library as his &quot;university&quot;. Kantor won a writing contest with his first story, &quot;Purple&quot;.

==Marriage and family==
Kantor married Florence Irene Layne, and they had two children together. Their son Tim Kantor wrote a memoir of his father, titled &quot;My Father&#x27;s Voice: MacKinlay Kantor Long Remembered&quot; (1988). His grandson, Tom Shroder wrote a biography of his grandfather titled, &quot;The Most Famous Writer Who Ever Lived: A True Story of My Family&quot;. (Blue Rider Press, 2016)

==Career==
===Stories, journalism, and novels===
From 1928 to 1934, Kantor wrote numerous stories for pulp fiction magazines, to earn a living and support his family; these works included crime stories and mysteries. He sold his first pulp stories, &quot;Delivery Not Received&quot; and &quot;A Bad Night for Benny&quot;, to Edwin Baird, editor of &quot;Real Detective Tales and Mystery Stories&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;Detective Fiction Weekly&quot;. In 1928, Kantor published his first novel, &quot;Diversey&quot;, set in Chicago, Illinois.

In 1932, Kantor moved with his family from the Midwest to New Jersey, in the New York metropolitan area. He was an early resident of Free Acres, a social experimental community developed by activist Bolton Hall in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. In two years, he sold 16 short stories and a serialized novel to Howard Bloomfield, editor of &quot;Detective Fiction Weekly&quot;. He also acquired a professional agent, Sydney Sanders.

Achieving some success by 1934, Kantor began to submit short stories to the &quot;slick magazines&quot; (glossies). His &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot;, published in &quot;Collier&quot; on August 24, 1935, became his most frequently reprinted story.

It was during this decade that Kantor first wrote about the American Civil War, beginning with his novel &quot;Long Remember&quot; (1934), set at the Battle of Gettysburg. As a boy and teenager in Iowa, Kantor had spent hours listening to the stories of Civil War veterans, and he was an avid collector of first-hand narratives. His work was also part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

During World War II, Kantor reported from London as a war correspondent for a Los Angeles newspaper. After flying with some bombing missions, he asked for and received training to operate the bomber&#x27;s turret machine guns, although he was not in service and this violated regulations. Kantor interviewed numerous wounded troops, whose thoughts and ideas inspired a later novel of his.

When Kantor interviewed U.S. troops, many told him the only goal was to get home alive. He was reminded of the Protestant hymn: &quot;When all my labors and trials are o&#x27;er / And I am safe on that beautiful shore [Heaven], O that will be / Glory for me!&quot; Kantor returned from the European theater of war on military air transport (MAT). After the war, the producer Samuel Goldwyn commissioned him to write a screenplay about veterans returning home. Kantor wrote a novel in blank verse, which was published as &quot;Glory for Me&quot; (1945). After selling the movie rights to his novel, Kantor was disappointed that the film was released under the title &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946), and that details of the story had been changed by the screenwriter Robert Sherwood. Kantor was said to have lost his temper with Goldwyn and walked off the Hollywood lot. The first 15 seconds of the movie note that it is &quot;based upon a novel by MacKinlay Kantor&quot;, but the novel&#x27;s title is not given. The film was a commercial and critical success, winning seven Academy Awards.

Beginning in 1948, Kantor arranged an intensive period of research with the New York City Police Department (NYCPD). He was the only civilian other than reporters allowed to ride with police on their beat. He often rode on night shifts, working with the 23rd Precinct, whose territory ranged from upper Park Avenue to East Harlem, comprising a wide range of residents and incomes. These experiences informed most of his short crime novels, as well as his major work &quot;Signal Thirty-Two&quot;, published in 1950 with jacket art by his wife Irene Layne Kantor.

Also in 1950 Kantor took up research into the post-war life of a war widow. In discussions with the chaplain at Mitchel Field, Kantor was referred to Margaret Stavish of Bellmore, New York, who had lost her B-24 pilot husband, Edward Dobson, killed in action on November 18, 1943, and in 1947 married John Stavish, a veteran of the Pacific theater. Kantor then published their story, &quot;V-J Day Plus Five Years,&quot; in the August 1950 issue of Redbook Magazine. And see: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JE_Hill_Crew_plaque_photo.jpg

Kantor was noted for his limited use of punctuation within his literary compositions. He was known for a lack of quotation marks and was influential in this regard on Cormac McCarthy, who said that Kantor was the first writer he encountered who left them out. Kantor was one of three primary influences on McCarthy&#x27;s adopting his unique style.

During his assignment with the U.S. troops in World War II, Kantor entered the Buchenwald concentration camp as they liberated it on April 14, 1945. During the next decade, that experience informed his research for and writing of &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955), his novel about the Confederate prisoner of war camp. One of the problems he struggled with in Germany and afterward was how to think of the civilians who lived near Buchenwald. As he struggled to understand, he developed ideas which he expressed in his novel, where he portrayed some civilian Southerners sympathetically, in contrast to officers at the camp. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1956 for &quot;Andersonville&quot;.

In writing more than 30 novels, Kantor often returned to the theme of the American Civil War. He wrote two works for young readers set in the Civil War years: &quot;Lee and Grant at Appomattox&quot; (1950) and &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1952).

In the November 22, 1960, issue of &quot;Look&quot; magazine, Kantor published a fictional account set as a history text, titled &quot;If the South Had Won the Civil War&quot;. This generated such a response that it was published in 1961 as a book. It is one of many alternate histories of that war.

Kantor&#x27;s last novel was &quot;Valley Forge&quot; (1975).

===Films===
In addition to journalism and novels, several of his novels were adapted for films by other writers.

Kantor was credited as writing the screenplay for &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Deadly Is the Female)&quot; (1950), a &quot;film noir&quot;. It was based on his short story by the same name, published February 3, 1940, in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. However, in 1992, it was revealed that Dalton Trumbo had written the &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; screenplay, as Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, had been blacklisted as a result of his refusal to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings. Kantor passed his payment on to Trumbo to help him survive.

Kantor acted in the film &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot; (1958).

The film &quot;Follow Me, Boys!&quot; (1966) was based on his novel &quot;God and My Country&quot;.

===Publishing===
He established his own publishing house, and published several of his works in the 1930s and 1940s.

==Death==
Kantor died of a heart attack in 1977, aged 73, at his home in Sarasota, Florida.

<doc id="960393" wikidata="Q545300" url="?curid=960393" title="Alonso de Salazar">
<text>Toribio Alonso de Salazar (died 5 September 1526) was a Spanish navigator of Castilian origin, who was the first Westerner to arrive on the Marshall Islands on 21 August 1526.

Born in Burgos, de Salazar was part of the Fray García Jofre de Loaísa&#x27;s expedition from Spain to the Spice Islands in 1525, the second in history to cross the Pacific Ocean, after the Magalhães-Elcano circumnavigation of the globe. De Salazar took command of &quot;Santa Maria de la Victoria&quot;, the last of seven ships to survive the voyage, after the deaths of Loaísa and Juan Sebastián Elcano. He sighted the Bokak Atoll in the Marshall Islands en route to Guam, the Philippine Islands and finally the Moluccas. After one month of holding the command, he also died of scurvy shortly after having left Guam on 5 September 1526, and was succeeded by Martín Íñiguez de Carquizano.
The character Armando Salazar from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is based on Alonso de Salazar.

<doc id="960395" wikidata="Q238733" url="?curid=960395" title="Charles Stenholm">
<text>Charles Walter Stenholm (October 26, 1938 – May 17, 2023) was an American businessman and Democratic Party politician from a rural district of the state of Texas. After establishing himself as owner-operator of a large cotton farm, he entered politics and was elected to Congress in his first run for office. Stenholm was a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives for 13 terms, representing Texas&#x27;s 17th congressional district from 1979 to 2005.

He was known for his conservative social positions, helping garner conservative Democratic support for President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts in 1981, and gaining passage of a new farm bill in 2002 that doubled farm subsidies for Texas agribusiness. In 1992 he supported an amendment to require the federal government to have balanced budgets. He prioritized rural and agriculture issues and is considered one of the leading architects of federal farm policy.

After leaving Congress when defeated by a Republican in 2004, Stenholm stayed in Washington, DC. He worked as a lobbyist for food and agricultural interests, primarily with Olsson Frank Weeda, a law and lobbying firm in Washington, DC.

==Early life and education==
Stenholm was born in 1938 in Ericksdahl, Texas (sometimes identified as Stamford), a farming community in Jones County that was settled in the early 20th century largely by Swedish immigrants, including his grandparents. His parents Lambert and Irene Constance Stenholm raised him on their plantation-scale, 2000-acre farm near Abilene. They cultivated mostly cotton as a commodity crop. After attending public schools, Stenholm graduated from Texas Tech University, with a B.S. (1961) and an M.S. (1962) in Agriculture Education. He was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

Stenholm took over his family farm, raising cotton and also having a cattle ranch. He operated the large cotton farm in Stamford for many years. He also worked as a vocational teacher. He married Cynthia Watson and they had three children together.

He began a career in agricultural politics when he was appointed to be member of the Texas State Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. He also served as an executive of the Rolling Plains Cotton Growers Association before being elected to Congress.

== Congressional career ==
Stenholm had gotten increasingly interested in politics. In 1965 he became a lobbyist for the Rolling Plains Cotton Growers Association. In late 1978 longtime Democratic Congressman Omar Burleson decided to resign from his office representing Texas&#x27;s 17th congressional district, a vast and mostly rural district which stretched from San Angelo to the western fringes of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Seeing an opportunity, Stenholm ran in his first campaign as a Democrat, and finished first in a crowded seven-way primary before winning the runoff with 67 percent of the vote. He then breezed to victory in November.

Stenholm established a reputation as one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, and belonged to the Blue Dog Coalition. He was a leader of the Boll Weevils during the 1980s, and Chair of the Conservative Democratic Forum from 1981 until about 1993. In 1981, Stenholm was one of the more prominent Democratic supporters of Republican President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s tax-cut package. A decade later, he said he regretted that support.

Like many Texas politicians, Stenholm was conservative on certain social issues; he opposed both abortion and gun control. In 1990 he was one of three House Democrats who voted against the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

Stenholm frequently clashed with Democratic President Bill Clinton during his administration; he voted for three of the four articles of impeachment against him. But Stenholm was also a severe critic of the succeeding Republican George W. Bush Administration&#x27;s fiscal policy. He voted against making Bush&#x27;s tax cuts permanent, as by then he strongly opposed cutting taxes unless the budget was balanced.

=== Agriculture policy ===
As a large farmer, Stenholm was chiefly interested in agriculture and also in budget matters. In 1992 he supported a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution requiring the federal government to keep to such budgets. He is considered one of the leading architects of federal farm and agricultural policy during the late 20th Century and early 21st Century.

In addition, for eight years, Stenholm was ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. He was among members who personally benefited from the subsidy program, originally authorized during the Great Depression to aid small farmers in staying on their land. Under the 1996 farm bill, from 1996 to 2002, Stenholm as a farmer received $39,000 in subsidies. At least ten of his colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, also received substantial farm subsidies during this period.

Stenholm worked very closely with Larry Combest, the committee&#x27;s chairman and a fellow farm owner, a Republican representing the neighboring Texas&#x27;s 19th congressional district. They shepherded the 2002 Farm Bill through Congress, in which Texas got the largest increase in subsidies of any state, doubling the amount received. During this period, the wealthiest 10% of farmers received 74% of the subsidies, which were directed at agribusiness. The 15 states that received 74% of the subsidies paid only 24% of the cost in their taxes, thus gaining a major federal handout.

===Electoral success and demographic changes===
Although the 17th&#x27;s voters had begun splitting their tickets and voting Republican in presidential and U. S. Senate elections from the 1970s onward, the Republican Party had little support at the local level at the time. Conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices in the 17th&#x27;s footprint well into the 1990s. Proving this, Stenholm faced no major-party opposition from 1980 to 1990. He ran unopposed in 1980 and from 1984 to 1990. Notably, he was elected unopposed in years when Republican presidential candidates carried the 17th in landslides.

In 1994, however, Stenholm was held to 53 percent of the vote by a then relatively unknown Republican candidate, Phil Boone. When his children heard the initial returns, they were so certain that he&#x27;d lost that they traveled to the family farm to console him. That same election saw Republicans win dozens of offices at the local level. Afterward, Stenholm ran for House Minority Whip, losing to David E. Bonior. While he was reelected four more times after that, Stenholm never won more than 60 percent of the vote, and he was nearly defeated in 1996 and 2002. During this time, Republicans gradually whittled away the Democratic advantage at the local level. By the end of the 20th century, Stenholm was the only Democrat elected above the county level in much of the 17th district. The district had swung so heavily to the GOP downballot by then that many observers thought it likely that Stenholm would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.

== Reelection defeat ==
Stenholm was considered a major target of the Republican-dominated House in the redrawing of Texas&#x27;s congressional districts in 2003, following the 2000 census. The Texas Legislature, now controlled by Republicans, significantly redrew the state&#x27;s congressional map after U.S. House of Representatives Majority leader Tom DeLay of the Houston-based 22nd district pushed for a new map. Stenholm&#x27;s district was dismantled and split among four districts. Most of his former territory, including his home in Abilene, was thrown into the heavily Republican Lubbock-based 19th congressional district, represented by Combest&#x27;s successor, Republican Randy Neugebauer. The next-biggest chunk of Stenholm&#x27;s former territory, including his cotton farm, was assigned to the equally Republican Amarillo-based 13th district, represented by Mac Thornberry.

Stenholm chose to run in the reconfigured 19th. The new district contained 60 percent of Neugebauer&#x27;s former territory, a disadvantage which Stenholm could not overcome, despite his 13 terms of seniority. He lost by 18 percentage points in the November 2004 election, gaining slightly more than 40 percent of the vote. To date, this is the only time since Combest claimed the 19th for the GOP in 1984 that a Democrat has garnered even 40 percent of the vote in the district.

== Post-Congressional life ==
Some major news organizations mentioned Stenholm as a possible candidate for Secretary of Agriculture in President George W. Bush&#x27;s second-term Cabinet, although Bush had supported the congressional redistricting plan. Bush nominated Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns, a fellow Republican, for the post.

After leaving Congress, Stenholm became a lobbyist, representing various agricultural interests, including the horse meat industry. In 2006, he was the most visible lobbyist for three foreign-owned horse-slaughter plants in the U.S., which were fighting regulatory legislation that would have resulted in their having to close. Meat from such horses was consumed as food by residents of some European Union countries, Japan, and Mexico; it was also used for zoo food and medical purposes.

From 2005, Stenholm was a senior policy advisor and lobbyist with Olsson Frank Weeda, a Washington law and lobbying firm that specializes in representing food, drug, and agriculture interests before federal agencies.

Stenholm was a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. He also served on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Stenholm later returned to Tarleton State University where he taught Agriculture Policy.

== Death ==
Stenholm died at his home in Granbury, Texas, on May 17, 2023, at the age of 84. Upon his death, many notable political leaders offered public tribute to Stenholm, including former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and the top leaders on the U.S. House and Senate committees on Agriculture.

<text>Tax exemption is the reduction or removal of a liability to make a compulsory payment that would otherwise be imposed by a ruling power upon persons, property, income, or transactions. Tax-exempt status may provide complete relief from taxes, reduced rates, or tax on only a portion of items. Examples include exemption of charitable organizations from property taxes and income taxes, veterans, and certain cross-border or multi-jurisdictional scenarios.

Tax exemption generally refers to a statutory exception to a general rule rather than the mere absence of taxation in particular circumstances, otherwise known as an exclusion. Tax exemption also refers to removal from taxation of a particular item rather than a deduction.

International duty free shopping may be termed &quot;tax-free shopping&quot;. In tax-free shopping, the goods are permanently taken outside the jurisdiction, thus paying taxes is not necessary. Tax-free shopping is also found in ships, airplanes and other vessels traveling between countries (or tax areas). Tax-free shopping is usually available in dedicated duty-free shops. However, any transaction may be duty-free, given that the goods are presented to the customs when exiting the country. In such a scenario, a sum equivalent to the tax is paid, but reimbursed on exit. More common in Europe, tax-free is less frequent in the United States, with the exception of Louisiana. However, current European Union rules prohibit most intra-EU tax-free trade, with the exception of certain special territories outside the tax area.

==Specific monetary exemptions==
Some jurisdictions allow for a specific monetary reduction of the tax base, which may be referred to as an exemption. For example, the U.S. Federal and many state tax systems allow a deduction of a specified dollar amount for each of several categories of &quot;personal exemptions&quot;. Similar amounts may be called &quot;personal allowances&quot;. Some systems may provide thresholds at which such exemptions or allowances are phased out or removed.

==Exempt organizations ==
Some governments grant broad exclusions from all taxation for certain types of organization. The exclusions may be restricted to entities having various characteristics. The exclusions may be inherent in definitions or restrictions outside the tax law itself.

===Approaches for exemption===
There are several different approaches used in granting exemption to organizations. Different approaches may be used within a jurisdiction or especially within sub-jurisdictions.

Some jurisdictions grant an overall exemption from taxation to organizations meeting certain definitions. The United Kingdom, for example, provides an exemption from rates (property taxes), and income taxes for entities governed by the Charities Law. This overall exemption may be somewhat limited by limited scope for taxation by the jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may levy only a single type of tax, exemption from only a particular tax.

Some jurisdictions provide for exemption only from certain taxes. The United States exempts certain organizations from Federal income taxes, but not from various excise or most employment taxes.

===Charitable, nonprofit and religious organizations ===
Many tax systems provide complete exemption from tax for recognized charitable or nonprofit organizations. Such organizations may include religious organizations (temples, mosques, churches, etc.), fraternal organizations (including social clubs), public charities (e.g., organizations serving homeless persons), or any of a broad variety of organizations considered to serve public purposes.

The U.S. system exempts from Federal and many state income taxes the income of organizations that have qualified for such exemption. Qualification requires that the organization be created and operated for one of a long list of tax-exempt purposes, which includes more than 28 types of organizations and also requires, for most types of organizations, that the organization apply for tax-exempt status with the Internal Revenue Service, or be a religious or apostolic organization. The U.S. system does not distinguish between various kinds of tax-exempt entities (such as educational versus charitable) for purposes of granting exemption, but does make such distinctions with respect to allowing a tax deduction for contributions.

The UK generally exempts public charities from business rates, corporation tax, income tax, and certain other taxes.

Tax exemption status of nonprofit organizations can in some cases result in financial mismanagement and negative societal value.

===Governmental entities ===
Most systems exempt internal governmental units from all tax. For multi-tier jurisdictions, this exemption generally extends to lower tier units and across units. For example, state and local governments are not subject to Federal, state, or local income taxes in the U.S.

===Pension schemes===
Most systems do not tax entities organized to conduct retirement investment and pension activities for employees of one or more employers or for the benefit of employees. In addition, many systems also provide tax exemption for personal pension schemes.

===Educational institutions===
Some jurisdictions provide separate total or partial tax exemptions for educational institutions. These exemptions may be limited to certain functions or income.

===Sales tax===

Most states and localities imposing sales and use taxes in the United States exempt resellers from sales taxes on goods held for sale and ultimately sold. In addition, most such states and localities exempt from sales taxes goods used directly in the production of other goods (i.e., raw materials).

==Exempt individuals ==
Certain classes of persons may be granted a full or partial tax exemption within a system. Common exemptions are for veterans, clergymen or taxpayers with children (who can take &quot;dependency exemption&quot; for each qualifying dependent who has lived with the taxpayer. The dependent can be a natural child, step-child, step-sibling, half-sibling, adopted child, eligible foster child, or grandchild, and is usually under age 19, a full-time student under age 24, or have special needs). The exemption granted may depend on multiple criteria, including criteria otherwise unrelated to the particular tax. For example, a property tax exemption may be provided to certain classes of veterans earning less than a particular income level. Definitions of exempt individuals tend to be complex.

==Exempt income ==
Most income tax systems exclude certain classes of income from the taxable income base. Such exclusions may be referred to as exclusions or exemptions. Systems vary highly. Among the more commonly excluded items are:
*Income earned outside the taxing jurisdiction. Such exclusions may be limited in amount.
*Interest income earned from subsidiary jurisdictions.
*Income consisting of compensation for loss.
*The value of property inherited or acquired by gift.

Some tax systems specifically exclude from income items that the system is trying to encourage. Such exclusions or exemptions can be quite specific or very general.

Among the types of income that may be included are classes of income earned in specific areas, such as special economic zones, enterprise zones, etc. These exemptions may be limited to specific industries. As an example, India provides SEZs where exporters of goods or providers of services to foreign customers may be exempt from income taxes and customs duties.

==Exempt property ==
Certain types of property are commonly granted exemption from property or transaction (such as sales or value added) taxes. These exemptions vary highly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and definitions of what property qualifies for exemption can be voluminous.

Among the more commonly granted exemptions are:
*Property used in manufacture of other goods (which goods may ultimately be taxable)
*Property used by a tax exempt or other parties for a charitable or other not for profit purpose
*Property considered a necessity of life, often exempted from sales taxes in the United States
*Personal residence of the taxpayer, often subject to specific monetary limitations

==Multi-tier jurisdictions==
Many countries that impose tax have subdivisions or subsidiary jurisdictions that also impose tax. This feature is not unique to federal systems, like the U.S., Switzerland and Australia, but rather is a common feature of national systems. The top tier system may impose restrictions on both the ability of the lower tier system to levy tax as well as how certain aspects of such lower tier system work, including the granting of tax exemptions. The restrictions may be imposed directly on the lower jurisdiction&#x27;s power to levy tax or indirectly by regulating tax effects of the exemption at the upper tier.

==Cross-border agreements==
Jurisdictions may enter into agreements with other jurisdictions that provide for double taxation relief. Such provisions are common in an income tax treaty. These reciprocal tax exemptions typically call for each contracting jurisdiction to exempt certain income of a resident of the other contracting jurisdiction.

Multi-jurisdictional agreements for tax exemption also exist. 20 of the U.S. states have entered into the Multistate Tax Compact that provides, among other things, that each member must grant a full credit for sales and use taxes paid to other states or subdivisions. The European Union members are all parties to the EU multi-country VAT harmonisation rules.

==Diplomatic tax exemptions==
The US provides a few tax exemptions for their diplomatic mission visitors.

===Sales tax exemption===
The Department’s Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) issues diplomatic tax exemption cards to eligible foreign missions and their accredited members and dependents on the basis of international law and reciprocity.

There are 2 types of diplomatic sales exemption cards.
====Mission tax exemption card====
This card is used by foreign missions to buy necessary items for the mission. This type of card work only while paying with a cheque, credit card, or wire transfer transaction and must be made in the name of the mission otherwise it is not eligible for the tax exemption. These cards may only be issued to a person, who is a principal member or an employee of the mission, holds an A or G visa, and is not a permanent resident of the USA.

====Personal tax exemption card====
This card is issued to eligible foreign mission members for exemption on their personal item purchases. The user of this card is the only person who might use this card on his purchases and he is the only one who can profit from them.

There are 4 levels of exemption cards, and each one holds a name after an animal:

* Owl: This card is for mission tax exemption with no restriction
* Buffalo: This card is for mission tax exemption with some degree of restriction
* Eagle: This card is for personal tax exemption with no restriction
* Deer: This card is for personal tax exemption with some degree of restriction
===Hotel tax exemption===
This is a tax exemption issued for purchases of hotel stays and other forms of lodging. The tax exemption card is required before paying for the lodging, if it is paid before acquiring it, or through the internet, the benefits are unusable.

====Official mission tax exemptions====
These exemptions might only be used for purchases necessary for the mission’s functioning. The mission is only available to be exempt from tax if the mission has a valid tax exemption card, the stay is required in support of the mission’s diplomatic or consular functions and the costs are paid with a cheque, credit card, or a wire transfer in the name of the mission.

====Personal tax exemption====
This card is issued only for the benefit of its holder and may not be used to benefit anyone else. The expenses are only exempt from tax if the person has a valid tax exemption card and the rooms are registered and paid only by the person holding the tax exemption card.
===Other exemptions===
Other exemptions in the US include those for vehicles, airlines, gasoline, utilities, and certain types of income.

==Historical uses==

In in the Hebrew Bible, King Saul includes tax exemption as one of the rewards on offer to whoever comes forward to defeat the Philistine giant Goliath.

Gregory of Tours, in his history of the Franks, claimed that the people of the city of Tours were given tax exemption by the Merovingian kings on account of the presence of the relics of St Martin of Tours and suggested that divine punishment from the saint could fall on anyone who violated this to reimpose taxes.

During some of the historical Muslim caliphates, those who believed or converted to Islam could be tax exempt. 

The inhabitants of Domrémy-la-Pucelle in France, were given tax exemption when Charles VII of France received a request from Joan of Arc to exempt the community (which was her home town) from taxes. This community was exempt from taxes until the time of French revolution, when the republican government restored taxation. 

In the Ottoman Empire, tax breaks for descendants of Muhammad encouraged many people to buy certificates of descent or forge genealogies; the phenomenon of &quot;teseyyüd&quot; – falsely claiming noble ancestry – spread across ethnic, class, and religious boundaries. In the 17th century, an Ottoman bureaucrat estimated that there were 300,000 impostors; In 18th-century Anatolia, nearly all upper-class urban people claimed descent from Muhammad. The number of people claiming such ancestry – which exempted them from taxes such as avarız and tekalif-i orfiye – became so great that tax collection was very difficult.

<text>Shirley Ann Grau (July 8, 1929August 3, 2020) was an American writer. Born in New Orleans, she lived part of her childhood in Montgomery, Alabama. Her novels are set primarily in the Deep South and explore issues of race and gender. In 1965 she won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature for her novel &quot;The Keepers of the House&quot;, set in a fictional Alabama town.

== Early life ==
Grau was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on July 8, 1929. Her father was a dentist; her mother was a housewife. She grew up in and around Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, with her mother. She graduated in 1950 Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. degree from Newcomb College, the women&#x27;s coordinate college of Tulane University.

== Career ==
Grau&#x27;s first collection of stories &quot;The Black Prince&quot; was nominated for the National Book Award in 1956. Nine years later, her novel &quot;The Keepers of the House&quot; was awarded the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It deals with an interracial marriage that was illegal, and the implications of the mixed-race children later passing as white. 

The morning she was called about the Pulitzer Prize, she thought it was a practical joke from a friend whose voice she thought she recognized. I was awfully short-tempered that morning because I&#x27;d been up all night with one of my children,&#x27; Grau said ... &#x27;So, I said to the voice I mistook, &quot;yeah and I&#x27;m the Queen of England too,&quot; and I hung up on him. The Pulitzer Prize committee member did not give up and called her publisher Alfred A. Knopf. &quot;The news got to me, but that was very embarrassing.&quot;

== Themes ==
Grau&#x27;s writing explores issues of death, destruction, abortion, and miscegenation, frequently set in historical Alabama or Louisiana. Although she did not restrict her writing to the Deep South or stories about women, she is recognized as an important writer in the fields of women&#x27;s studies, feminist literature, and Southern literature.

== Personal life ==
In 1955 Grau married James Feibleman, a fellow writer and a professor of philosophy at Tulane University. The pair were introduced by Grau&#x27;s friend, a student of Feibleman. She legally changed her surname to his but retained her maiden name when writing. Together, they had four children—two sons (Ian and William) and two daughters (Nora and Katherine). The family settled in Metairie, on the outskirts of New Orleans. They were still married when he died in 1987. Grau died on August 3, 2020, at a retirement home in Kenner, Louisiana. She was 91 and had suffered from complications of a stroke.

<doc id="960407" wikidata="Q156045" url="?curid=960407" title="Eleanor of Austria">
<text>Eleanor of Austria (15 November 1498 – 25 February 1558), also called Eleanor of Castile, was born an Archduchess of Austria and Infanta of Castile from the House of Habsburg, and subsequently became Queen consort of Portugal (1518–1521) and of France (1530–1547). She also held the Duchy of Touraine (1547–1558) in dower. She is called &quot;Leonor&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese and &quot;Éléonore&quot; or &quot;Aliénor&quot; in French.

She was the elder sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and her life was dominated by her role in the international dynastic politics of the period.

==Life==

Eleanor was born in 1498 at Leuven, the eldest child of Philip the Handsome and Joanna of Castile, who would later become co-sovereigns of Castile. Her father was also the son of the reigning Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and his deceased consort Mary of Burgundy, while her mother was the daughter of the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Her siblings were Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, Queen Isabella of Denmark, Queen Mary of Hungary, and Queen Catherine of Portugal. She was named after her paternal great-grandmother, Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress. After the death of her father in September 1506 Eleanor was educated at the court of her aunt Margaret of Austria in Mechelen (in modern Belgium).

When she was a child, Eleanor&#x27;s relatives tried to marry her to the future King of England, Henry VIII, who was seven years her senior. However, when Henry&#x27;s father died and he became king, Henry decided to marry Eleanor&#x27;s aunt, Catherine of Aragon, who was the widow of King Henry&#x27;s older brother, Arthur, Prince of Wales. Her relatives also tried to marry her to the French kings Louis XII or Francis I, or to the Polish King Sigismund I, but nothing came of these plans. Eleanor was also proposed as a marriage candidate for Antoine, Duke of Lorraine, in 1510.

In 1517 Eleanor may have had a love affair with Frederick II, Elector Palatine. Her brother King Charles, who had succeeded their elderly grandfather King Ferdinand as King of Aragon the year before, once discovered her reading a love letter from Frederick. Charles forced Eleanor and Frederick to swear in front of a lawyer that they were not secretly married, after which he expelled Frederick from court. She followed her brother to Spain in 1517.

=== Queen of Portugal ===

Eleanor married her uncle by marriage, King Manuel I of Portugal, after a proposed marriage with her cousin, the future King John III of Portugal, did not occur. Her brother Charles arranged the marriage between Eleanor and the King of Portugal to avoid the possibility of Portuguese assistance for any rebellion in Castile. Manuel had previously been married to two of Eleanor&#x27;s maternal aunts, Isabella of Aragon and Maria of Aragon.

Manuel and Eleanor married on 16 July 1518. They had two children: the Infante Charles (born 18 February 1520 – died 15 April 1521) and the Infanta Maria (born 8 June 1521, and who was later one of the richest princesses of Europe). Eleanor became a widow on 13 December 1521, when Manuel died of the plague. As Queen Dowager of Portugal, Eleanor returned to the court of Charles in Spain. Eleanor&#x27;s sister Catherine later married Eleanor&#x27;s stepson, King John III of Portugal.

In July 1523, Eleanor was engaged to Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, in an alliance between Charles and Bourbon against France, but the marriage never took place. In 1526, Eleanor was engaged to King Francis I of France during his captivity in Spain.

=== Queen of France ===

The Treaty of Cambrai (1529; called &quot;La Paz de las Damas&quot; - &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Peace&quot;) paused the conflict between Francis and Charles. It included the stipulation that the previously agreed upon marriage of Eleanor and Francis would take place.

Eleanor left Spain in the company of her future stepsons, who had been held hostage by her brother. The group met Francis at the border, and then departed for an official entrance to Bordeaux. She was married to Francis on 4 July 1530. Eleanor was crowned Queen of France at the Basilica of Saint-Denis on 31 May 1531. She was dressed in purple velvet at her coronation. They had no children.

Eleanor was ignored by Francis, who seldom performed his marital obligations and preferred his lover Anne de Pisseleu d&#x27;Heilly. At the official entrance of Eleanor to Paris, Francis displayed himself openly to the public in a window with Anne for two hours.

Queen Eleanor performed as the queen of France at official occasions, such as the wedding between her stepson Henry and Catherine de&#x27; Medici in 1533. She also performed charity and was praised for this. She also took her stepdaughters, Madeleine and Margaret, into her household to raise them further.

As queen, Eleanor had no political power; however, she served as a contact between France and Emperor Charles. Queen Eleanor was present at the peace negotiations between Francis and Charles in Aigues-Mortes in 1538. In 1544, she was given the task of entering peace negotiations with Charles and their sister Mary of Hungary. In November 1544, she visited Charles in Brussels.

===Later life===
As a queen dowager, Eleanor left France for Brussels in 1548. She witnessed the abdication of Charles in October 1555 and left for Spain with him and their sister Mary in August 1556. She lived with her sister in Jarandilla de la Vera, where they often visited their brother, who retired to the Monastery of Yuste nearby. In 1558, she met her daughter Maria in Badajoz for the first time in 28 years. Eleanor became ill while returning from Badajoz. Eleanor died on 25 February 1558, on the return trip from Badajoz. Her brother was devastated to learn of her death and he himself died seven months later.

==Family==
With Manuel I of Portugal:
* Infante Charles (born 18 February 1520 – died 15 April 1521); died in infancy.
* Maria of Portugal, Duchess of Viseu (born 8 June 1521 – died 10 October 1577); never married and did not have issue.

<doc id="960423" wikidata="Q7572957" url="?curid=960423" title="Spaldeen">
<text>A Spalding Hi-Bounce Ball, often called a Spaldeen or a Pensie Pinkie, is a rubber ball, described as a tennis ball core without the felt. These balls are commonly used in street games developed in the mid-20th century, such as Chinese handball (a variation on American handball), Australian Handball, stoop ball, hit-the-penny (involving trying to make a penny flip on a sidewalk), butts up, handball, punchball, boxball, half-rubber, Wireball and stickball (variations of baseball).

==Name==
The term arose from a local pronunciation of &quot;Spalding&quot; in Brooklyn, with Spalding being the sporting goods company that produced the balls. The name has become so common that Spalding now uses it in marketing, and it is now a registered trademark. The ball is also known as a &quot;Pensie Pinkie&quot; or &quot;Pennsy Pinky&quot; referring to Penn Racquet Sports, another sporting goods manufacturer brand.

==History==
The original Spaldeens were tennis balls that had been rejected for slight defects. Instead of throwing them away, Spalding stamped &quot;Spalding High-Bounce Ball&quot; on the rubber rejects and sold them cheaply to wholesalers. They were popular with children from the 1930s through to the 1970s. The balls sold for 15 cents in the 1950s. In urban areas sparse in grass, Spaldeens became integral to many street games due to their bounciness and light weight. Players of these games at the time said of the spaldeen, if dropped from a person&#x27;s eye height, it would rebound to half of their total height. Citing the declining popularity of stickball, Spalding took the ball off the market in 1979, but it returned in 1999 to much fanfare. After reintroducing spaldeens in 1999, Spalding sold more than 2 million in the first year.

In his memoir, New York Senator Chuck Schumer recalls playing slapball with spaldeens as a child growing up in Brooklyn, and refers to the baseball-inspired game and its bouncy ball as his era&#x27;s video game.

==Colors==
Since its return in 1999 Spaldeens have been manufactured in a variety of colors in addition to pink. Some of them are black, blue, green, orange, purple, red, and yellow.

<doc id="960428" wikidata="Q3437301" url="?curid=960428" title="Clevis fastener">
<text>A clevis fastener is a two-piece fastener system consisting of a &quot;clevis&quot; and a &quot;clevis pin head&quot;.

==Terms==
The &quot;clevis&quot; is a U-shaped piece that has holes at the end of the prongs to accept the clevis pin. The &quot;clevis pin&quot; is similar to a bolt, but is either partially threaded or unthreaded with a cross-hole for a split pin. A &quot;tang&quot; is a piece that is sometimes fitted in the space within the clevis and is held in place by the clevis pin. The combination of a simple clevis fitted with a pin is commonly called a &quot;shackle,&quot; although a clevis and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take.

==Usage==
Clevises are used in a wide variety of fasteners used in farming equipment and sailboat rigging, as well as the automotive, aircraft and construction industries. They are also widely used to attach control surfaces and other accessories to servo controls in airworthy model aircraft. As a part of a fastener, a clevis provides a method of allowing rotation in some axes while restricting rotation in others.

==Clevis pin==

There are two main types of clevis pins: threaded and unthreaded. Unthreaded clevis pins have a domed head at one end and a cross-hole at the other end. A cotter pin (US usage) or split pin is used to keep the clevis pin in place. Threaded clevis pins have a partially threaded shank on one end and a formed head on the other. The formed head has a lip, which acts as a stop when threading the pin into the shackle, and a flattened tab with a cross-hole. The flattened tab allows for easy installation of the pin and the cross-hole allows the pin to be moused.

A bolt can function as a clevis pin, but a bolt is not intended to take the lateral stress that a clevis pin must handle. Normal bolts are manufactured to handle tension loads, whereas clevis pins and bolts are designed to withstand shearing forces. The sheering strength of a threaded bolt is determined by its inner thread diameter.

Clevis pins should be closely fitted to the holes in the clevis to limit wear and reduce the failure rate of either the pin or the clevis.

==Twist clevis==

A twist shackle provides a loop at a right angle to the axis of rotation. Older farming implements intended to be pulled by a team of draft animals often require a twist shackle to be hitched.

==Clevis hanger==

A clevis hanger consists of one U-shaped clevis and a second V-shaped clevis with a hole in a flattened section at the base of the V, joined together with a bolt or pin. Clevis hangers are used as a pipe attachment providing vertical adjustment for pipes.

==Clevis bracket==
A clevis bracket generally takes the form of a solid metal piece with a flat rectangular base, fitted with holes for bolts or machine screws, and two rounded wings in parallel forming a clevis. Commonly used in aircraft and cars, clevis brackets allow mounting of rods to flat surfaces.

==Clevis hook==
A clevis hook is a hook, with or without a snap lock, with a clevis and bolt or pin at the base. The clevis is used to fasten the hook to a bracket or chain.

==Clevis rod end==
A clevis rod end is a folded or machined piece formed into a clevis and fitted with a hole at its base to which a rod is attached. In machined pieces, the hole is most often threaded.

==Twin clevis==
A twin clevis is a solid piece with two clevises directly opposite one another, each fitted with a pin. Twin clevises are commonly used to join two lengths of chain.

<doc id="960429" wikidata="Q3249163" url="?curid=960429" title="List of French dukedoms">
<text>This is a list of French dukedoms from the beginning of feudalism in the 9th century to the end of the French monarchy in the 19th century.

==History==

The Duchies of France were founded in the 9th century by the Carolingian Kings and the princely members of their family who shared the Empire of Charlemagne which they had inherited by reorganizing all the Carolingian kingdoms of France into feudal duchies and counties vassals of the King of France.

===Administrative districts===
In the continuity of the administration of the Roman Empire, the various Germanic kingdoms set up districts of command entrusted to representatives of the aristocracy, appointed and dismissed by the sovereign. These dukes often had authority over several counties. The commands of the border regions took the name of &quot;march&quot; () or &quot;marquisate&quot; (). The precise geography of these districts is difficult to establish, especially since their contours were very fluctuating. Many of these commands, having become hereditary, evolved into territorial principalities of the feudal type.

===Feudal titles===

In the late Middle Ages and the modern era, the duchy and peerage were attributed to smaller feudal groups, mainly former counties. The holders were most often princes of the royal family, under the rule of appanage which required that the extinction of the male descendants of the first holder led to the attachment to the royal domain of the duchy.

==Modern Duchies==
The duchies of the &quot;Ancien régime&quot; were more complex than those of the medieval period. Essentially, the new duchies were not independent principalities and the ducal status was not definitively attached to the fiefs erected into duchies. The letters patent of creation contain clauses of succession which regulate the future of the duchies. In most cases, the rule chosen is that of succession by males: upon the extinction of the male descendants of the beneficiary of the erection into a duchy, the duchy reverts to its &quot;previous state&quot; lordship, county or other. Further distinction was made between dukes and peers, who sat in parliament; hereditary dukes, and patent dukes, whose title was not transmissible. In 1566, Charles IX issued an order that set forth that hereditary duchies would be reversible to the Crown in the absence of males heirs.

Some duchies have changed their name during their history: the Duchy of Thouars, for example, is often called the Duchy of Trémoïlle. Furthermore, it was not uncommon for certain fiefs to be erected into duchies under another name. Thus, the Duchy of Montmorency was re-created in 1633 under the name of Enghien, which remained attached to a lake in the Montmorency region, a lake which gave its name to the town of Enghien-les-Bains.

The title of duke, abolished during the French Revolution, was reestablished in 1806. Several dukes were created under the Empire and under the governments that followed. Under the &quot;Ancien régime&quot;, from the 16th century onwards, the title of &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot; was used to designate the eldest son of the Prince of Condé. Duke Henri de Bourbon, who was a minister in 1723, is particularly well known in history under this name.

===Duchies created by French sovereigns===
Of the 218 titles created (141 under the &quot;Ancien régime&quot;, 33 under the First Empire, 33 under the Restoration, 7 under the July Monarchy, 4 under the Second Empire), only about forty remain today, the others becoming extinct.

===Ethnic composition by municipalities, 1991 census===


==Historical population==
Historically Sarajevo had always been a very populous city, but as the Ottoman Empire declined, so did its population. Although it had around 100,000 people in the 1660s, by the end of World War II in the 1940s Sarajevo had only grown to some 115,000 people.

The population of the district of Sarajevo, according to the 1921 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes religious population census:
* Serbian Orthodox Christians 55,477 (&quot;38.6%&quot;)
* Sunni Muslims 50,270 (&quot;34.9%&quot;)
* Roman Catholic Christians 29,395 (&quot;20.4%&quot;)
* &quot;Others&quot; 8,768 (&quot;6.1%&quot;)

In 1921 there were 8 municipalities, and their populations were:
* Serbs comprised majorities in 5 municipalities: Ilidža, Koševo, Pale, Rajlovac, and Trnovo.
* Bosniaks comprised majorities in the City of Sarajevo and in 2 municipalities: Bjelašnica and Ozren.

The same year, the City of Sarajevo had 78,173 inhabitants:
* Sunni Muslims 29,649 (&quot;37.9%&quot;)
* Roman Catholic Christians 21,373 (&quot;27.3%&quot;)
* Serbian Orthodox Christians 18,630 (&quot;23.8%&quot;)
* &quot;Others&quot; 8,522 (&quot;11.0%&quot;)

Heavy industrialization and increased importance in regional affairs during the time of Yugoslavia resulted in a rapid increase, however, and by the time of the 1984 Olympics, the greater Sarajevo area had more than 500,000 residents. Although exact &quot;ethnic&quot; distribution is unknown, of these 500,000, 49% were Muslim, 30% Orthodox Christians, and 7% Catholics, indicating relatively corresponding percentages of Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats.

The Yugoslav wars and the resulting siege of Sarajevo radically disrupted this order of things. The city itself was completely surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces, and it has been estimated that some 12,000 people were killed, with another 50,000 wounded. Combined with horrific living conditions forced upon by the besieging forces, the result was thousands of refugees leaving the city. By 1996, Sarajevo had less than 300,000 residents. The majority Sarajevan Serbs, massively fled the Bosnian capital, with their fears fuelled by propaganda, rumors and mass panic. Early estimates stated 62,000 Serbs leaving Sarajevo, In the years that followed, a tremendous influx of returning refugees and people from a war-torn countryside resulted in the city population once again going above 300,000 residents.

The following are some recorded populations of Sarajevo throughout its history. The figures from 1580 and 1800 are from H. Inalcık, &quot;An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire&quot; (1994). The figures from 1626 and 1660 are based on the accounts of traveling writers who estimated that Sarajevo at the time had 20,000 houses, and figures an average of 5 people per house. All latter figures are based on official censuses by Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and Socialist Yugoslavia, except for that of 2002, which is an estimate by the Sarajevo Canton government. All figures after 1945 represent the greater Sarajevo area.
==Population density==
According to the official government statistics, Sarajevo&#x27;s population density is 2470.1 per square kilometer. The most densely populated part of Sarajevo is in the municipality Novo Sarajevo (7524.5 inhabitants per square kilometer), while the least densely populated is the Stari Grad municipality (742.5 inhabitants per square kilometer).

==Age==
Regarding the age structure of Sarajevo, the overwhelming majority of people are between 15 and 64 years of age. This group consists of 208,703 people, a little over 70% of the total city population. When it comes to people 14 years of age or under and people over 65 years of age, the youth have a slight edge. There are 47,558 people under 14 years of age in Sarajevo, making up 16% of the overall population, compared to 41,138 people over 65 years of age, who make up 13.8% of the total population. The Novi Grad municipality has the highest percentage of citizens under 14 years of age in the city, at 17.4%, while 17.5% of Novo Sarajevo municipality&#x27;s population is over 65 years of age. Overall, the city&#x27;s population is slightly older than its surrounding areas and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole.

==Ethnic groups==
The biggest ethnic group in Sarajevo are the Bosniaks who, with more than 230,000 people, make up 77.4% of the city. They are followed by the Serbs, of which there are some 10,000 (3% of the city), and Croats with a population of 14,000 (5% of the total population). 9,283 people (3.1% of the overall population) are classified as others. They most likely consist of Sephardi Jews, and Romani, along with a small number of foreign workers and also Bosnians who come from mixed marriages and do not take either side as their own, other than simply &#x27;others&#x27; or Bosnians.

==Birth rate==
The city&#x27;s birth rate is 9.17 while the mortality is 8.10, resulting in a population growth rate of 1.07. The greater Sarajevo area, meanwhile, has a 9.56 birth rate and 8.01 mortality rate, which makes for a population growth rate of about 1.55. This would indicate a population of 303,797 in the city by December 2004, and a population of 413,649 in the metropolitan area. If current growth trends continue, the city&#x27;s population should reach the pre-war population in less than 25 years. The metro area would do the same a bit sooner, in some 15 years.

<text>The economy of Sarajevo is based largely on industries such as manufacturing and tourism. Sarajevo is economically one of the strongest regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the center of various levels of area politics, many Sarajevo citizens also work in government. A number of local and international companies are present in the city and contribute to its economic health.

Sarajevo is the most populous region, urban zone and the only metropolitan area in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The area generates approximately 45% of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s GDP.

==Overview==
Sarajevo&#x27;s economy reached its peak in the 1980s, thanks in large part to the culmination of several decades of industrial development and a tourist boom following the 1984 Winter Olympics, as well as increased international investment. During the Siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb forces often targeted structures key to the city’s economic health, including the headquarters of companies and many services and public utilities. Since then, the Sarajevo economy has made tremendous progress, significantly better than its post-war state in 1996.

Sarajevo&#x27;s manufacturing deals with a wide array of products. This includes production of Foods and Beverages, textiles, furniture, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and metalworking. Sarajevo companies also produce unique brands of alcohol and cigarettes.

According to Sarajevo Canton statistics, the greater Sarajevo area in 2002 had a workforce of 278,341. 86,012 (30.6%) of these were, on average, actually employed. Of those 86,012, some 37,253, or 43,3%, were women. The largest number of people were employed in industry (19.4%), trade (12.9%), transport (9.9%) and education (8.7%). The largest concentration of jobs is in Centar municipality (34.5%) and Novo Sarajevo (20.8%).

In 2002, the total export for the greater Sarajevo region was worth about 259.569.000 KM. This was an increase of 21.9% from the previous year. Most of Sarajevo&#x27;s exports (28.2%) head to Germany, with the United Kingdom following behind at 16.8% and Serbia thirds with 12.8%. The largest amount of imported goods come from Germany, at 15.8%. With a worth of total import at about 1.322.585.000 KM, the total import is almost 5.1 times the total export.

A variety of important economic institutions are to be found in Sarajevo. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina is found in the city, as are numerous other independent banks. Overall, 19 different banks have their headquarters in Sarajevo. The city also holds the Sarajevo Exchange of securities, Institute for accounting and auditing of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Board for valuable papers of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Register of valuable papers of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Foreign companies with a foothold in the Sarajevo region include Brown &amp; Root, Burger King, Coca-Cola, KFC, Porsche, Philip Morris International, Zara and so on. The Bosnian-Malaysian firm Bosmal is also situated in the city. Their main exports are clothing and electrical goods.

<doc id="960440" wikidata="Q290633" url="?curid=960440" title="Jean Stafford">
<text>Jean Stafford (July 1, 1915 – March 26, 1979) was an American short story writer and novelist. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for &quot;The Collected Stories of Jean Stafford&quot; in 1970.

==Biography==
She was born in Covina, California, to Mary Ethel (McKillop) and John Richard Stafford, a Western pulp writer. As a youth Stafford attended the University of Colorado Boulder and, with friend James Robert Hightower, won a one-year fellowship to study philology at the University of Heidelberg from 1936 to 1937.

Her first novel, &quot;Boston Adventure&quot;, was a best-seller, earning her national acclaim. She wrote two more novels in her career, but her greatest medium was the short story: her works were published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and various literary magazines. In 1955 she won first place in the O. Henry Awards for her story &quot;In the Zoo&quot;. For the academic year 1964–1965, she was a Fellow on the faculty at the Center for Advanced Studies of Wesleyan University.

Stafford was married three times. Her first marriage was to poet Robert Lowell, in 1940. She was seriously injured in an automobile accident with Lowell at the wheel in 1938, a trauma she described in one of her best-known stories, &quot;The Interior Castle,&quot; and the disfigurement she suffered as a result was a turning point in her life. A second marriage to &quot;Life&quot; magazine staff writer Oliver Jensen ended in divorce. Stafford enjoyed a brief period of domestic happiness with her third husband, A. J. Liebling, a prominent writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. After his death in 1963, she nearly stopped writing fiction, though she continued to write non-fiction essays.

==Death and legacy==
For many years Stafford suffered from alcoholism, depression, and pulmonary disease. By age sixty-three she had almost stopped eating and died of cardiac arrest in White Plains, New York, in 1979. She was buried in Green River Cemetery, East Hampton, New York.

In &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, E. B. White cites Stafford as an example of good prose: &quot;Jean Stafford, to cite a modern author, demonstrates in her story &#x27;In the Zoo&#x27; how prose is made vivid by the use of words and images that evoke sensations.&quot; 

Several biographies of Jean Stafford were written following her death, notably David Roberts&#x27; &quot;Jean Stafford: a Biography&quot; (1988), Charlotte Margolis Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Jean Stafford: The Savage Heart&quot; (1990), and Ann Hulbert&#x27;s &quot;The Interior Castle: The Art and Life of Jean Stafford&quot; (1992).

<doc id="960444" wikidata="Q3554462" url="?curid=960444" title="Vancouver South (federal electoral district)">
<text>Vancouver South () is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1917 to 1997, and since 2004. It covers the southern portion of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. The district will be replaced by Vancouver Fraserview—South Burnaby for the 45th Canadian federal election.

==Demographics==
The riding is one of the most diverse in Canada, with less than one-fifth of the population being of European descent. As of 2021, four pan-ethnic groups form greater than 10 percent of the riding; 38.1% East Asian, 18.7% European, 17.8% South Asian and 16% Southeast Asian.

Vancouver South is the centre of the city&#x27;s South Asian community; the colourful Punjabi Market (&quot;Little India&quot;) and the close-knit community of religious Sikhs dominate the area. The service sector, retail trade and manufacturing are the major sources of employment in Vancouver South. Nearly 30% of residents over the age of 25 years have obtained a university certificate or degree. The average family income is over $71,000. Unemployment is around 6.3%.

==History==
This electoral district was formed in 1914 from Vancouver City riding.

In 1996, it was abolished and used to create Vancouver South—Burnaby with portions of New Westminster—Burnaby.

Vancouver South was re-created in 2003 when the Burnaby sections were moved into the new ridings Burnaby—Douglas and Burnaby—New Westminster.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Vancouver South should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined Vancouver South loses a portion of its current territory west of Cambie Street to the new district of Vancouver Granville, and gains a small area in the northeast currently included in Vancouver Kingsway. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015. After the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, district was replaced by Vancouver Fraserview—South Burnaby, Vancouver Granville and Vancouver Kingsway.

<doc id="960447" wikidata="Q35571410" url="?curid=960447" title="Patel">
<text>Patel is an Indian surname or title, predominantly found in the state of Gujarat, representing the community of land-owning farmers and later (with the British East India Company) businessmen, agriculturalists and merchants. Traditionally the title is a status name referring to the village chieftains during medieval times, and was later retained as successive generations stemmed out into communities of landowners. Circa 2015 there are roughly 500,000 Patels outside India, including about 150,000 in the United Kingdom and about 150,000 in the United States. As of the 2000 U.S. Census, yearly 1 in 10 people of Indian origin in the US is a Patel.

== As a title ==
*Patel is a title of the Koli caste of Gujarat in India which has the greatest importance in the Politics of Gujarat. The Koli Patels of Saurashtra benefited the most under the rule of Indian National Congress party. Koli Patels are recognised as an Other Backward Class caste by Government of Gujarat. Koli Patels are Agriculturist by profession and own the high landholding in villages. Koli Patels also call themselves as Mandhata Patel and Mandhata Koli Patel and those who have migrated to East Africa are Businessman and civil servants. Some of the well known Clans of Koli Patels are Chauhan, Makwana and Rathod.
*Patidars of Gujarat also use the Patel title as traditionally village headmen.
*Parsis, who were biggest herdsman of the village adopted the title of Patel.
*Muslims of Gujarat also use Patel as title who converted from Hindu Kolis and Patidars.

==Etymology==
The Gujarati term &quot;paṭel&quot;, along with its cognate Marathi terms &quot;pāṭel&quot; and &quot;pāṭīl&quot;, are derived from the Prakrit word &quot;paṭṭaïl(l)a-&quot; &quot;village headman&quot;, itself derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;paṭṭakila&quot; &quot;tenant of royal land&quot;, a term first appearing in the &quot;Vetālapañcaviṃśatikā&quot;.&quot;&quot;

==Geographical distribution==
The surname historically originated in the Indian state of Gujarat, where it is amongst the most common of surnames. Today, the name is found across India, as well as in the Indian diaspora.

In 2009, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; released a news article indicating that, in the United Kingdom, the surnames Patel and Singh now rank amongst native ones such as Smith and Jones. With those who immigrated to Germany during British colonial rule in India, Gujaratis used the variation &quot;Pätel&quot;, with an umlaut, to better integrate with German society.

<doc id="960448" wikidata="Q4296284" url="?curid=960448" title="Myrsinoideae">
<text>Myrsinoideae is a subfamily of the family Primulaceae in the order Ericales. It was formerly recognized as the family Myrsinaceae, or the myrsine family, consisting of 35 genera and about 1000 species. It is widespread in temperate to tropical climates extending north to Europe, Siberia, Japan, Mexico, and Florida, and south to New Zealand, South America, and South Africa.

Plants are mostly mesophytic trees and shrubs; a few are lianas or subherbaceous. Their leathery, evergreen leaves are simple and alternate, with smooth margins and without stipules. They are often dotted with glands and resinous cavities. The latter may take the form of secretory lines.

The plants are mostly monoecious, but a few are dioecious. Their small flowers are arranged in racemose terminal clusters, or in the leaf axils. The flowers have four or five sepals and petals. The floral envelope (perianth) has a distinct calyx and corolla. The calyx is regular and polysepalous. The nonfleshy petals of the corolla are more or less united, closely overlapping. The four or five stamens are usually isomerous with the perianth. The carpel has one style and one stigma, with the ovary unilocular, superior or semi-inferior.

The one-seeded, indehiscent fruit is a thin-fleshed berry or drupe.
North American species are the marlberry (&quot;Ardisia escalloniodes&quot;) and the Florida rapanea (&quot;Myrsine cubana&quot;).

Plants in the subfamily have few economic uses. A few genera, such as &quot;Ardisia&quot;, &quot;Cyclamen&quot;, &quot;Lysimachia&quot;, and &quot;Myrsine&quot;, are grown as ornamental plants, especially &quot;Ardisia crispa&quot; and &quot;Myrsine africana&quot;. One species, &quot;Ardisia japonica&quot; (Chinese: 紫金牛; pinyin: &quot;zǐjīn niú&quot;), is one of the 50 fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine.

In the APG III system and onwards, the Myrsinaceae were not recognized, but were sunk into Primulaceae, which in that system is circumscribed very broadly.

The following genera, traditionally categorized in Primulaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, should, according to Källersjö et al. (2000), belong to the Myrsinoideae (the clade of Myrsinaceae &quot;s. l.&quot;): &quot;Anagallis&quot;, &quot;Ardisiandra&quot;, &quot;Asterolinon&quot;, &quot;Coris&quot;, &quot;Cyclamen&quot;, &quot;Glaux&quot;, &quot;Lysimachia&quot;, &quot;Pelletiera &quot; and &quot;Trientalis&quot;.

<text>Johannes Franciscus Alphonsus Marinus (John) Opdam (1916-1983) was a Dutch murderer.

==Early life==
Opdam was born in October 1916 in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies. In 1936, he moved to the Netherlands. There he studied medicine and married Arnolda van Eyl, a teacher&#x27;s daughter.

==First murder==
During his wife&#x27;s vacation in 1951, Opdam had an affair with the couple&#x27;s maid, Nellie. Mrs. Opdam found out, but being a devoted Catholic, there was never any question of a divorce. Instead, Nellie was sacked. This did not stop Opdam from continuing his affair with the girl. In 1952, Mrs. Opdam&#x27;s health declined steadily until she died on 24 September. Doctor Opdam claimed it was a brain tumor, but the colleague who performed the post-mortem disagreed and gave the cause of death as &#x27;unknown&#x27;. Police were called to the case and a second examination of the body revealed Mrs. Opdam&#x27;s body contained prussic acid. Johannes Opdam was arrested. During his trial, he at one point even accused his mother-in-law of committing the murder.

==Prison, second murder==
On 8 June 1954 Opdam was sentenced to life in prison. In the prison in Leeuwarden Opdam continued he met Arie Lodder, who was also convicted for killing his wife. They agreed upon writing notes confessing each other&#x27;s murders, to be used when one of them would die. In February 1958, Arie Lodder was found dead in his cell, which was next to that of Doctor Opdam&#x27;s. Lodder too had been poisoned with prussic acid and on his body a note was found that he had taken a medicine Doctor Opdam had given him. In the meanwhile, both Doctor Opdam and the prison director had received a letter from Lodder, claiming that it was Lodder who had killed Mrs. Opdam.

Opdam had obtained the chemicals to poison Lodder from his cousin-in-law. It is also possible that Lodder&#x27;s parents had the poison delivered to the prison in Leeuwarden, thinking it was a medicine for their son. The letters and the trick did not set Opdam free, however. On the contrary, in 1961, he was again sentenceded to life in prison, this time for the murder of Arie Lodder. He remains the only person in Dutch judicial history to have been sentenced twice to life in prison for two different murders.

<text>Anoplopomatidae, the sablefishes, are a small family of ray-finned fishes classified within the order Perciformes. These fishes are found in the North Pacific Ocean.

==Taxonomy==
Anoplopomatidae was first proposed as a family in 1883 by the American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert. In 1965 Jay C. Quast proposed that the sablefishes were so different from other members of the Cottoidei that they should be classified within their own superfamily, the Anoplopomatoidea. The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies this superfamily within the suborder Cottoidei of the order Scorpaeniformes. However, other authorities place it within the infraorder Anoplopomatales which is close to the infraorder Zoarcales at the base of the Cottoidei within the order Perciformes.

==Genera==
Anoplopomatidae contains two monospecific genera:

==Characteristics==
Anoplopomatidae fishes have heads which lack spines, ridges, or cirri. They have two dorsal fins, the second dorsal fin having between 16 and 21 soft rays. The anal fin has three weak spines and between 11 and 19 soft rays. Their pelvic fins have a single spine and 5 soft rays, There are two well-developed nostrils on either side of the snout. The gill membranes are joined to isthmus. There is a single lateral line. Of the two species in the family the sablefish (&quot;Anoplopoma fimbria&quot;) is the smaller attaining a maximum total length of while the skilfish (&quot;Erilepis zonifer&quot;) reaches .

==Distribution==
Anoplopomatidae species are both distributed in the North Pacific Ocean from Japan to the Bering Sea and along the western coast of North America especially California,

<doc id="960455" wikidata="Q3331244" url="?curid=960455" title="Yakub (Nation of Islam)">
<text>Yakub (also spelled Yacub or Yaqub) is a figure in the mythology of the Nation of Islam (NOI) and its offshoots. According to the NOI&#x27;s doctrine, Yakub was a black Meccan scientist who lived 6,600 years ago and created the white race. According to the story, following his discovery of the law of attraction and repulsion, he gathered followers and began the creation of the white race through a form of selective breeding referred to as &quot;grafting&quot; on the island of Patmos; Yakub died at the age of 150, but his followers continued the process after his death. According to the NOI, the white race was created with an evil nature, and were destined to rule over black people for a period of 6,000 years through the practice of &quot;tricknology&quot;, which ended in 1914. 

The story and idea of Yakub originated in the writings of the NOI&#x27;s founder Wallace Fard Muhammad. Scholars have variously traced its origins in Fard&#x27;s thought to the idea of the Yakubites propounded by the Moorish Science Temple, the  Battle of Alarcos, or alternatively say it may have been created originally with little basis in any other tradition. Scholars have argued the tale is an example of a black theodicy, with similarities to gnosticism with Yakub as demiurge, as well as the story of Genesis. It has also been interpreted as a reversal of the contemporary racist ideas that asserted the inferiority of black people. 

The story has, throughout its history, caused disputes within the NOI. Under its current leader Louis Farrakhan, the NOI continues to assert that the story of Yakub is true, not a metaphor, and has been proven by modern science. Several other splinter groups and other black nationalist religious organizations, including the Nuwaubian Nation, the Five-Percent Nation and the United Nation of Islam, share a belief in Yakub.

==Summary==
=== Original version ===
According to the story, at the start of human history, a variety of types of black people inhabited the moon; when a black &quot;god-scientist&quot; became frustrated that all those living on the moon did not speak one language, he blew up the moon. A piece of this destroyed moon became the Earth, which was then populated by a community of surviving, morally righteous black people, some of whom settled in the city of Mecca. Yakub was born a short distance outside the city, and was among the third of original black people who were discontented with life in this society. A member of the Meccan branch of the Tribe of Shabazz, Yakub acquired the nickname &quot;big head&quot;, because of his unusually large head and arrogance. 

At the age of six, he discovered the law of attraction and repulsion by playing with magnets made of steel. He connected this to the rules of human attraction: the &quot;unlike&quot; people would attract, manipulate the original &quot;like&quot; people. By the age of 18, he had finished his education and had learned everything that Mecca&#x27;s universities had to teach him, widely known as a successful scientist. He then discovered that the original black man contained both a &quot;black germ&quot; and a &quot;brown germ&quot;, with the brown being the recessive one, and believed that if he could separate them by &quot;grafting&quot;, he could graft the brown germ into a white germ. This insight led to a plan to create a new people, who, using tricks and lies, could rule the original black man and destroy them.

He attracted a following but caused trouble, leading the Meccan authorities to exile him and his 59,999 followers. They then went to an isle in the Aegean Sea called Pelan, which Elijah Muhammad identified as modern-day Patmos. Yakub developed Christianity to fool the black people into supporting him and to trick them into not knowing their true history. Once there, he established a despotic regime, starting to breed out the black traits of his followers. This entailed breeding new children, with those who were too dark being killed at birth and their bodies being fed to wild animals or incinerated. Yakub died at the age of 150, but his followers carried on his work as he passed down his knowledge. After 600 years, the white race was created. All the races other than the black race were by-products of Yakub&#x27;s work, as the &quot;red, yellow and brown&quot; races were created during the &quot;bleaching&quot; process, with the red germ coming out of the brown, the yellow coming from the red, and from the yellow the white.

The brutal conditions of their creation determined the evil nature of the new race: &quot;by lying to the black mother of the baby, this lie was born into the very nature of the white baby; and, murder for the black people was also born in them—or made by nature a liar and murderer&quot;. As a group of people distinct from the Original Asiatic Race, the white race are bereft of divinity, being intrinsically prone to lying, violence, and brutality. According to the Nation&#x27;s teachings, Yakub&#x27;s newly created white race sowed discord among the black race, and thus were exiled to live in the caves of Europe (&quot;West Asia&quot;). In this narrative, it was in Europe that the white race engaged in bestiality and degenerated, losing everything except their language. They were kept in Europe by guards. Elijah Muhammad also asserted that some of the new white race tried to become black, but failed. As a result, they became gorillas and other monkeys. 

To help the whites develop, the ruling Allah then sent prophets to them, the first of whom was Musa (Moses), who taught the whites to cook and wear clothes. Moses tried to civilize them, but eventually gave up and blew up 300 of the most troublesome white people with dynamite. According to the Nation, Jesus was also a prophet sent to try and civilize the white race. However, the whites had learned to use &quot;tricknology&quot;; a plan to use their trickery and lack of empathy and emotion to usurp power and enslave the black population, bringing the first slaves to America. According to NOI doctrine, Yakub&#x27;s progeny were destined to rule for 6,000 years before the original black peoples of the world regained dominance, the end of which was the year 1914.

=== Nuwaubian version ===
An alternative version of the story was told by the Nuwaubian Nation, a black supremacist new religious movement run by Dwight York: this is set out in a roughly 1,700 page book called &quot;The Holy Tablets&quot;. In the Nuwaubian telling of the Yakub myth, 17 million years before the first of many &quot;intergalactic battles&quot;, the ancestors of black people (given a variety of names, including Riziquians) were gods, but subservient to the &quot;Supreme God&quot;. Riziquians lived in another galaxy on a planet known as &quot;Rizk&quot;, which was located in the &quot;Original Tri-Solar System&quot; which featured a &quot;moveable throne&quot;/spaceship, Nibiru.

In their telling the original protective atmospheric layer of this planet, necessary to protect from the UV rays of its three suns, had been destroyed by an evil being who was the leader of the fallen angels, Shaitan. Shaitan had been asked by the supreme god to move, either off the planet entirely or to a different location on it. He refused, and instead set off an atomic explosion &quot;like an H-bomb&quot;, destroying part of the atmosphere. The scientists of the planet were able to repair it with gold, but there wasn&#x27;t enough gold on the planet, necessitating excursions into space on the Nibiru to mine gold from planet Earth, where colonies were established.

The Riziquians did not want to mine gold, believing it was beneath their status as angels. They spliced genes of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; with their own genomes, producing mankind to do it for them. Humans originally had various psychic abilities, but after wars and Cain and Abel, the gland responsible for these psychic powers was removed from the human brain by the Riziquians. Yakub was born with two brains (the Nuwaubian explanation for the size of his large head), making him a genius capable of gene-splicing experiments, which resulted in white people. After his experiments were finished, one of his brains exploded, resulting in his death.

==Origins of the story==

The story of Yakub originated in the writings of Wallace Fard Muhammad, the founder of the Nation of Islam, in his doctrinal Q&amp;A pamphlet &quot;Lost Found Moslem Lesson No. 2&quot; from the early 1930s. It was developed by his successor Elijah Muhammad in several writings, most fully in a chapter entitled &quot;The Making of Devil&quot; in his book &quot;Message to the Blackman in America&quot;. The story of Yakub includes Jews as part of a wider artificially created &quot;white&quot; race.

In the Book of Genesis, biblical patriarch Jacob makes a deal with his uncle Laban to divide livestock amongst themselves. The black goats and sheep will belong to Laban, while spotted, speckled or brown goats will belong to Jacob. After Laban agrees, Jacob places wood &quot;with white streaks&quot; in front of the strongest animals during breeding so as to produce spotted offspring. He further uses selective breeding to ensure &quot;the feebler would be Laban&#x27;s, and the stronger Jacob&#x27;s&quot;. Leaders in the early-20th century Eugenics movement like James Barr cited the Jacob story in their literature, often from an anti-Semitic point of view. Knight opines: &quot;The prominence of Jacob as not only a controller of animal heredity but a selfish, scheming deceiver presents him as a natural candidate for the engineer of the white race&quot;.

In speeches by Malcolm X, Yakub is identified completely with the Jacob of Genesis. Referring to the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel, Malcolm X states that Elijah Muhammad told him that &quot;Jacob was Yacub, and the angel that Jacob wrestled with wasn&#x27;t God, it was the government of the day&quot;. This was because Yakub was seeking funds for his expedition to Patmos, &quot;so when it says Jacob wrestled with an angel, &#x27;angel&#x27; is only used as a symbol to hide the one he was really wrestling with&quot;. However, Malcolm X also states that John of Patmos was also Yakub, and that the Book of Revelation refers to his deeds: &quot;John was Yacub. John was out there getting ready to make a new race, he said, for the word of the Lord&quot;. 

Ernest Allen argues that &quot;the Yakub myth may have been created out of whole cloth by Prophet Fard&quot;. Allen says the Yakub story could conceivably have been influenced by a real historical event during the struggle between Muslims and Christians for control of Spain. Muslim leader Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur defeated the Franks at the Battle of Alarcos (1195). After the battle, 40,000 European prisoners of war were taken to Morocco to labor on Yaqub&#x27;s building projects. They were then set free and &quot;allowed to form a valley settlement located somewhere between Fez and Marrakesh. On his deathbed Ya&#x27;qub lamented his decision to allow these Shibanis (as they came to be called) to form an enclave on Moroccan soil, thereby posing a potential threat to the stability of the Moorish empire&quot;.

Yusuf Nuruddin says that a more direct source was the doctrine of the &quot;Yacobites&quot; or &quot;Yakubites&quot; propounded by Timothy Drew&#x27;s Moorish Science Temple, to which Fard may have belonged before he founded the NOI. According to Drew, early pre-Columbian civilizations were founded by a West African Moor &quot;named Yakub who landed on the Yucatan Peninsula&quot;, whose people evolved into &quot;a race of scientific geniuses with large heads&quot;. Drew&#x27;s followers said this was supported by the large heads of the Olmec statues, which they claimed reflected African features; Nuruddin argues this indicated that the Yakub myth was influenced by the Moorish Science Temple&#x27;s theology.

==Role in the Nation of Islam==
The Yakub story attempts to rationalize &quot;black suffering&quot; through the lens of Islamic theology, trying to give it a religious meaning and understanding. Even for those members who refused to take the story literally, it provided a useful metaphor for racial relations and oppression. Elijah Muhammad repeatedly referred to whites as &quot;the devil&quot;. The Nation maintains that most white people are unaware of their true origins, but that such knowledge is held by senior white Freemasons.

The doctrine is not present or substantiated in mainstream Islam. As a result, it has led to controversy: Malcolm X in his &quot;Autobiography&quot; notes that, in his travels in the Middle East, many Muslims reacted with shock upon hearing about the doctrine of Yakub. When Malcolm founded his own religion organization, Muslim Mosque, Inc., he did not carry over the concept of Yakub. 

Louis Farrakhan reinstated the original Nation of Islam, and has reasserted his belief in the literal truth of the story of Yakub. In a 1996 interview, Henry Louis Gates, Chairman of Harvard University&#x27;s Afro-American Studies Department, asked him whether the story was a metaphor or literal. Farrakhan claimed that aspects of the story had been proven accurate by modern genetic science and insisted that &quot;Personally, I believe that Yakub is not a mythical figure—he is a very real scientist. Not a big-head silly thing, as they would like to say&quot;. However, he did later cease speaking of the related &quot;white devil&quot; concept. Farrakhan&#x27;s periodical &quot;The Final Call&quot; continues to publish articles asserting the truth of the story, arguing that modern science supports the accuracy of Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s account of Yakub. The NOI splinter groups the Five-Percent Nation and the United Nation of Islam also believe in the Yakub doctrine.

== Commentary ==
Harold Bloom in his book &quot;The American Religion&quot; argues that Yakub combines elements of the biblical God and the Gnostic concept of the Demiurge, saying that &quot;Yakub has an irksome memorability as a crude but pungent Gnostic Demiurge&quot;. Nathaniel Deutsch also notes that Fard and Muhammad draw on the concept of the Demiurge, along with traditions of esotericism in Biblical interpretation, absorbing aspects of Biblical tales to the new narrative, such as the swords of the Muslim warriors keeping the &quot;white devils&quot; from Paradise, like the flaming sword of the angel protecting the Garden of Eden in Genesis. Yusuf Nuruddin also compared the Yakub story to the Genesis story, with the opposing group to the initial utopian society being comparable to the snake in the Garden of Eden. In his view the story of the later expulsion of Yakub was comparable to the expulsion of Adam and Eve, as well as the fall of man.

Edward Curtis calls the story &quot;a black theodicy: a story grounded in a mythological view of history that explained the fall of black civilization, the Middle Passage from Africa to the Americas, and the practice of Christian religion among slaves and their descendants&quot;. Stephen C. Finley also called it a theodicy. Several commentators state that the story, by associating blacks with ancient high civilizations and whites with cave-dwelling barbarians and gorillas, both uses and spectacularly reverses the populist and scientific racism of the era which identified Africans as primitive, or closer to apes than whites. This drew on earlier criticisms of white supremacist Nordicism, creating a mythic version of &quot;attacks on AngloSaxon lineage and behavior that had been voiced by more mainstream black thinkers during the nineteenth century. [...] With these references the [NOI] Muslims replicated the images of European savagery in the Middle Ages that were so pervasive in nineteenth-century black racial thought&quot;.

==In popular culture==

The American author and playwright Amiri Baraka&#x27;s play &quot;A Black Mass&quot; (1965) takes inspiration from the story of Yakub. In Baraka&#x27;s version the experiment creates a single Frankenstein-like &quot;white&quot; monster who kills Jacoub and the other magician-scientists and bites a woman, transforming her in a vampire-like way into a white-devil mate for himself. From this monstrous couple the white race is descended. According to critic Melani McAlister, &quot;the character of Yakub, now called Jacoub, is introduced as one of three &#x27;Black Magicians&#x27; who together symbolize the black origin of all religions&quot;. McAlister argues that Baraka turns the Yakub story &quot;into a reinterpretation of the Faust story and a simultaneous meditation on the role and function of art.&quot; saying that &quot;As with Faust, Jacoub&#x27;s individualism and egotism are his undoing, but his failings also signal the destruction of a community.&quot; He also compared his version of the story to Frankenstein, in its conflation of &quot;the six hundred years of Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s &quot;history&quot; into a single, terrible moment of the creation of a monster.&quot;

According to Charise L. Cheney, the doctrine of Yakub has had a significant influence in rap culture, mentioning several rappers. She argues that the rapper Kam (a member of the NoI), in his 1995 song &quot;Keep tha Peace&quot;, uses the Yakub doctrine in order to explain &quot;the roots of black-on-black crime and gang violence in America&#x27;s inner cities&quot;, noting the lyrics:

She also notes Grand Puba&#x27;s 1990 lyric, in which he announces that &quot;his calling was to bring enlightenment to black people and an end to white domination&quot; saying &quot;Here comes the god to send the devil right back to his cave. […] We&#x27;re gonna drop the bomb on the Yakub crew&quot;. Chuck D of Public Enemy also refers to the story in his song &quot;Party for Your Right to Fight&quot;, referring to the Yakub story by attributing the deaths of African American radicals to the &quot;grafted devils&quot; conspiring against the &quot;Black Asiatic Man&quot;.

<doc id="960460" wikidata="Q736776" url="?curid=960460" title="Tennis elbow">
<text>Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis is an enthesopathy (attachment point disease) of the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis on the lateral epicondyle.  It causes pain and tenderness over the bony part of the lateral epicondyle. Symptoms range from mild tenderness to severe, persistent pain. The pain may also extend into the back of the forearm. It usually has a gradual onset, but it can seem sudden and be misinterpreted as an injury.
Tennis elbow is often idiopathic. Its cause and pathogenesis are unknown. It likely involves tendinosis, a degeneration of the local tendon.

It is thought this condition is caused by excessive use of the muscles of the back of the forearm, but this is not supported by evidence. It may be associated with work or sports, classically racquet sports (including paddle sports), but most people with the condition are not exposed to these activities. The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and examination. Medical imaging is not very useful.
Untreated enthesopathy usually resolves in 1–2 years. Treating the symptoms and pain involves medications such as NSAIDS or acetaminophen, a wrist brace, or a strap over the upper forearm. The role of corticosteroid injections as a form of treatment is still debated. Recent studies suggests that corticosteroid injections may delay symptom resolution.

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients typically feel pain or burning around the outer part of the elbow (lateral epicondyle of the humerus), which can move down the forearm and sometimes up to the upper arm. The pain is worsened by activities that involve wrist extension, such as gripping objects. Pain intensity varies from mild to severe and can be intermittent or constant, significantly impacting daily life. Patients also commonly report grip weakness and difficulty lifting.

===Terminology===
The term &quot;tennis elbow&quot; is widely used (although informal), but the condition affects non-tennis players. More recently, with the explosive growth of pickleball, the term &quot;pickleball elbow&quot; is frequently used. Historically, the medical term &quot;lateral epicondylitis&quot; was most commonly used for the condition, but &quot;itis&quot; implies inflammation and the condition is not inflammatory. It is also referred to as enthesopathy of the extensor carpi radialis origin.

Since histological findings reveal noninflammatory tissue, the terms &quot;lateral elbow tendinopathy&quot; and &quot;tendinosis&quot; are suggested. In 2019, a group of international experts suggested that &quot;lateral elbow tendinopathy&quot; was the most appropriate terminology. But a disease of an attachment point (or enthesia) is most accurately referred to as an &quot;enthesopathy.&quot;

==Causes==
The exact cause of lateral epicondylitis remains unclear. However, it is often linked to repetitive microtrauma resulting from excessive gripping, wrist extension, radial deviation, and/or forearm supination.

Traditionally, people have speculated that tennis elbow is a type of repetitive strain injury resulting from tendon overuse and failed healing of the tendon, but there is no evidence of injury or repair, and misinterpretation of painful activities as a source of damage is common.

==Pathophysiology==
The extensor carpi radialis brevis is the most commonly affected muscle in lateral epicondylitis (LE), along with other extensor carpal muscles. Due to its unique origin, the ECRB tendon is prone to abrasion during elbow movements, leading to repetitive microtrauma.

Lateral epicondylitis was initially considered an inflammatory process, however there is no evidence of inflammation or repair. Therefore, the disorder is more appropriately referred to as &quot;tendinosis&quot; or &quot;tendinopopathy.&quot; Tendinosis, a degenerative condition with fibroblasts, abnormal collagen, and increased blood vessels. Repetitive stress causes microtears, scar tissue formation, and biomechanical changes, worsening symptoms over time.

Recently, successful results of a prospective therapeutic study of tennis elbow were published. It was observed that tennis elbow symptoms were most painful after awakening. It was hypothesized that a very common sleep position was interfering with healing and causing pain. The study evaluated if changing this position would avoid pressure on the lateral elbow while asleep. Patients who changed this sleep position reported successful resolution of symptoms, whereas those who were unable to change continued to have pain. The conclusion reached is that the pathophysiology of tennis elbow is due to an initial microscopic tear from a sprain/strain. This initial injury is aggravated at night by pressure on the sprain which delays healing. In other words, tennis elbow is neither a tendonitis nor a tendinosis, but more like a pressure sore. If the pressure is removed the initial injury goes on to heal. The importance of this finding is that other conditions characterized by nocturnal or early morning symptoms may also be worsened by a “pathological sleep position.” We know this applies to carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome, plantar fasciitis, shoulder/neck pain and Gerd. 

==Clinical evaluation==

===Physical examination===
Diagnosis is based on symptoms and clinical signs that are discrete and characteristic. For example, the extension of the elbow and flexion of the wrist causes outer elbow pain. The physical examination usually reveals marked tenderness at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle from the lateral epicondyle (extensor carpi radialis brevis origin). Pain may worsen with resisted wrist extension, middle finger extension, and forearm supination with an extended elbow, although normal elbow movement is often maintained, even in severe cases.

====Cozen&#x27;s test====
Cozen&#x27;s test is a physical examination performed to evaluate for tennis elbow involving pain with resisted wrist extension. The test is said to be positive if a resisted wrist extension triggers pain to the lateral aspect of the elbow owing to stress placed upon the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. The test is performed with extended elbow. NOTE: With elbow flexed the extensor carpi radialis longus is in a shortened position as its origin is the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus. To rule out the ECRB (extensor carpi radialis brevis), repeat the test with the elbow in full extension.

===Medical imaging===
Medical imaging is not necessary or helpful.

Radiographs (X-rays) may demonstrate calcification where the extensor muscles attach to the lateral epicondyle. Medical ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate the pathology, but are not helpful for diagnosis and do not influence treatment.

Longitudinal sonogram of the lateral elbow displays thickening and heterogeneity of the common extensor tendon that is consistent with tendinosis, as the ultrasound reveals calcifications, intrasubstance tears, and marked irregularity of the lateral epicondyle. Although the term “epicondylitis” is frequently used to describe this disorder, most histopathologic findings of studies have displayed no evidence of an acute, or a chronic inflammatory process. Histologic studies have demonstrated that this condition is the result of tendon degeneration, which replaces normal tissue with a disorganized arrangement of collagen. Colour Doppler ultrasound reveals structural tendon changes, with vascularity and hypo-echoic areas that correspond to the areas of pain in the extensor origin.

Table of Clinical classification of lateral epicondylitis phases.
=== Prevention ===
Activity modification is the best way to prevent the occurrence of lateral epicondylitis. Prevention can include avoiding extreme end range motions in extension and flexion, limit repetitive hand and wrist motions, and modification of heavy lifting with extended arms. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol drinking, and dietary habits are known to influence the prognosis of various medical conditions. Smokers showed a higher chance of developing lateral epicondylitis compared to non-smokers. Current research indicates that alcohol intake is not significantly associated with lateral epicondylitis.

=== Non-Operative Treatment ===
Non operative treatment resolves 90% of symptomatic lateral epicondylitis. Nonoperative care usually includes activity modification, physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, bracing, extracorporeal shock-wave therapy, and acupuncture. Modifying activity and avoiding overuse are key to treatment. Lifting with the palm up and avoiding palm-down movements can shift strain from the lateral to the medial epicondyle, easing pain. Patients should also improve lifestyle habits and avoid triggering activities. Following the RICE method (rest, ice, compression, elevation) can help relieve pain initially.

===Exercises===
Stretching and isometric strengthening are the most common recommended exercises. 

The muscle is stretched with the elbow straight and the wrist passively flexed. 

Isometric strengthening can be done by pushing the top of the hand up against the undersurface of a table and holding the wrist straight.

===Orthotic devices===
Orthosis is a device externally used on the limb to improve the function or reduce the pain. Orthotics may be useful in tennis elbow; however, long-term effects are unknown. There are two main types of orthoses prescribed for this problem: counterforce elbow orthoses and wrist extension orthoses. Counterforce orthosis has a circumferential structure surrounding the arm. This orthosis usually has a strap which applies a binding force over the origin of the wrist extensors. The applied force by orthosis reduces the elongation within the musculotendinous fibers. Wrist extensor orthosis maintains the wrist in the slight extension.

=== Speculative treatments ===
Other approaches that are not experimentally tested include eccentric exercise using a rubber bar, joint manipulation directed at the elbow and wrist, spinal manipulation directed at the cervical and thoracic spinal regions, low level laser therapy, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy.

===Medication===
Recent studies demonstrate that topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications are effective within four weeks for lateral epicondylitis. Evidence for oral NSAIDs is mixed. Research indicates that  corticosteroid injections improved outcomes more effectively than NSAIDs within four weeks but offered no long-term benefits at 12 months.

Other studies suggest that, while helpful for short-term pain relief, corticosteroid injections are less effective than watchful waiting or physical therapy after one year. Repeated injections can also lead to tendon rupture and muscle atrophy. Thus, clinicians should be cautious with corticosteroid use for lateral epicondylitis due to limited long-term effectiveness and possible adverse effects.

=== Alternative Treatments ===
While many alternative treatments, such as shockwave, laser, low-frequency electrical nerve stimulation, ultrasound, and pulsed magnetic wave therapies, have been used, none have been proven effective. Current evidence is inconclusive on the effectiveness of acupuncture was effective for lateral epicondylitits.

==== Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Injections ====
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) has emerged as a potential treatment for lateral epicondylitis. PRP is derived from the patient&#x27;s own blood and contains concentrated platelets, which are rich in growth factors. These growth factors are believed to initiate and accelerate tissue repair and regeneration support healing of the tendons and connective tissue and promote the growth of new blood vessels, aiding the recovery process.

The PRP procedure for lateral epicondylitis involves extracting a small amount of the patient&#x27;s blood, separating the plasma through centrifugation, and re-injecting it directly into the lateral epicondyle. While good outcomes have been reported with PRP for lateral epicondylitis, the overall literature is still unclear on its effectiveness. Additionally, variations in PRP preparation methods and injection techniques across different commercial systems add further complexity to assessing its effectiveness.

Overall, current research on PRP as a treatment for lateral epicondylitis is promising. However, more studies are needed to provide clear evidence of its effectiveness.

===Surgery===
Most patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) improve with conservative treatments and do not need surgery. However, if symptoms persist despite prolonged conservative therapy, surgical options should be reconsidered. Several surgical procedures are available for lateral epicondylitis, most involving the removal of damaged tissue from the ECRB and scraping of the lateral epicondyle. This procedure can be done through open, percutaneous, or arthroscopic methods.

==== Percutaneous Surgery ====
Percutaneous surgical approach is mainly used for releasing the common extensor tendon origin at the lateral epicondyle. This technique has been demonstrated to be safe, reliable, and cost-effective Good midterm outcomes in pain relief have been widely reported with a percutaneous surgical approach. However there is some limited evidence reported that arthroscopic and open techniques achieved a better prognosis than the percutaneous surgical approach for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. In recent years, a new technique termed as ultrasound-guided percutaneous tenotomy has been reported as a safe and effective for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis, with improvements in symptoms, function, and ultrasound imaging at 1-year follow-up.

==== Arthroscopic Surgery ====
Arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive option for treating lateral epicondylitis. This technique fully visualizes the elbow joint, and leads to a quicker return to work. In the past, studies have shown good long term effects and fewer complications with arthroscopic surgery compared to open or percutaneous approaches. However, the literature is currently mixed with some recent reviews suggest no significant differences among open, arthroscopic, and percutaneous methods regarding recovery time, complication rates, or patient satisfaction. While others state that arthroscopic surgery may allow for a quicker return to work, suggesting a potential advantage in the early postoperative period. While results are generally positive, arthroscopic surgery carries risks of injury to the radial nerve and lateral ulnar collateral ligament.

==Epidemiology==
Tennis Elbow is a commonly seen condition and has been reported to affect 1% to 3% of adults each year. The incidence of lateral elbow tendinosis has declined, which could be due to shifts in diagnostic practices or an actual drop in cases. Understanding the typical disease progression can help patients and providers choose the best treatment approach.

=== Symptoms of lateral epicondylitis ===

Symptoms suggestive of lateral epicondylitis are present in about 1% of the adult population and are most common between ages 40 and 60. The prevalence varies somewhat between studies, likely as a result of varied diagnostic criteria and limited reliability between different observers. The data regarding symptoms of lateral epicondylitis in relation to occupations and sports are inconsistent and inconclusive. The shortcomings of the evidence that addresses the relationship between symptoms and occupation/sport include: variation in diagnostic criteria, limited reliability of diagnosis, confounding association of psychosocial factors, selection bias due to a high non-response rate, and the fact that exposures are usually by subjective patient reports and symptomatic patients might receive greater exposure.

==History==

German physician F. Runge is usually credited for the first description of the condition, calling it &quot;writer&#x27;s cramp&quot; (&quot;Schreibekrampf&quot;) in 1873. Later, it was called as &quot;washer women&#x27;s elbow&quot;. British surgeon Henry Morris published an article in &quot;The Lancet&quot; describing &quot;lawn tennis arm&quot; in 1883. The popular term &quot;tennis elbow&quot; first appeared the same year in a paper by H. P. Major, described as &quot;lawn-tennis elbow&quot;.

<text>The Cimetière des Rois (French: &quot;Cemetery of Kings&quot;) (officially Cimetière de Plainpalais) is a cemetery in Geneva, Switzerland. The cemetery is commonly named after la &quot;rue des Rois&quot; (French: &quot;Kings&#x27; Street&quot;) near which it is situated. The graveyard was established in 1482 for people who died from plague in the Middle Ages, during the second plague pandemic.

== Personalities ==
The right to rest in the cemetery of Plainpalais is strictly limited. Under Article 30 (3) of the City of Geneva Cemeteries Regulations, only &quot;magistrates and distinguished personalities, having contributed by their life and activity to the influence of Geneva&quot; can claim a concession whose request must be made to the Administrative Council.

In the cemetery are buried John Calvin (the Protestant reformer), Jorge Luis Borges (the Argentine author), Sérgio Vieira de Mello (the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights), Ernest Ansermet (renowned Swiss conductor), and Jean Piaget (the noted developmental psychologist and epistemologist). The composers Frank Martin, Alberto Ginastera, Denis de Rougemont, Griselidis Real and Alice Rivaz, Jeanne de Salzmann, chemist Humphry Davy, editor François Lachenal, Robert Musil and actor François Simon are also buried there. Politicians are also buried there, such as Adrien Lachenal (President of the Confederation), Paul Lachenal, Antoine Carteret, Willy Donzé, and Gustave Moynier (President of the Red Cross). Max van Berchem (founder of Arabic epigraphy), and Eglantyne Jebb (founder of Save the Children, drafter of Declaration of the Rights of the Child)

<text>Wendy Wasserstein (October 18, 1950 – January 30, 2006) was an American playwright. She was an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. She received the Tony Award for Best Play and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1989 for her play &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Wasserstein was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the daughter of Morris Wasserstein, a wealthy textile executive, and his wife, Lola (née Liska) Schleifer, who moved to the United States from Poland when her father was accused of being a spy. Wasserstein &quot;once described her mother as being like &#x27;Auntie Mame&#x27;&quot;. Lola Wasserstein reportedly inspired some of her daughter&#x27;s characters. Wendy was the youngest of five siblings, including brother Bruce Wasserstein, a well-known investment banker.

Her maternal grandfather was Simon Schleifer, a yeshiva teacher in Włocławek, Poland, who moved to Paterson, New Jersey, and became a high school principal. Claims that Schleifer was a playwright are probably apocryphal, as contemporaries did not recall this and the assertion only appeared once Wasserstein had won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

A graduate of the Calhoun School (she attended from 1963 to 1967), Wasserstein earned a B.A. in history from Mount Holyoke College in 1971, an M.A. in creative writing from City College of New York in 1973, and an M.F.A. in fine arts from the Yale School of Drama in 1976. In 1990 she received an &quot;honoris causa&quot; Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Mount Holyoke College and in 2002 she received an &quot;honoris causa&quot; degree from Bates College.

===Career===
Wasserstein&#x27;s first production of note was &quot;Uncommon Women and Others&quot; (her graduate thesis at Yale), a play which reflected her experiences as a student at, and an alumna of, Mount Holyoke College. The play was workshopped at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center in 1977, 
and a full version of the play was produced in 1977 Off-Broadway with Glenn Close, Jill Eikenberry, and Swoosie Kurtz playing the lead roles. The play was subsequently produced for PBS with Meryl Streep replacing Close. While at Yale, she co-wrote a musical with fellow student Christopher Durang, &quot;When Dinah Shore Ruled the Earth&quot;.

In 1989, she won the Tony Award, the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for her play &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;.

Her plays, which explore topics ranging from feminism to family to ethnicity to pop culture, include &quot;The Sisters Rosensweig&quot;, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic&quot;, &quot;An American Daughter&quot;, &quot;Old Money&quot;, and her last work, which opened in 2005, &quot;Third&quot;.

During her career, which spanned nearly four decades, Wasserstein wrote eleven plays, winning a Tony Award, a Pulitzer Prize, a New York Drama Critics Circle Award, a Drama Desk Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award.

In addition, she wrote the screenplay for the 1998 film &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot;, which starred Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd.

Wasserstein is described as an author of women&#x27;s identity crises. &quot;Her heroines—intelligent and successful but also riddled with self-doubt—sought enduring love a little ambivalently, but they did not always find it, and their hard-earned sense of self-worth was often shadowed by the frustrating knowledge that American women&#x27;s lives continued to be measured by their success at capturing the right man.&quot; In a conversation with novelist A. M. Homes, Wasserstein said that these heroines are the starting points for her plays: &quot;I write from character, so it begins with people talking, which is why I like writing plays.&quot;

Wasserstein commented that her parents allowed her to go to Yale only because they were certain she would meet an eligible lawyer there, get married, and lead a conventional life as a wife and mother. Although appreciative of the critical acclaim for her comedic streak, she described her work as &quot;a political act&quot;, wherein sassy dialogue and farcical situations mask deep, resonant truths about intelligent, independent women living in a world still ingrained with traditional roles and expectations.

In 2007 she was featured in the film &quot;Making Trouble&quot;, a tribute to female Jewish comedians, produced by the Jewish Women&#x27;s Archive.

Wasserstein also wrote the books to two musicals. &quot;Miami&quot;, written in collaboration with Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman, was presented at Playwrights Horizons in 1985–1986, and starred among others, Marcia Lewis, Phyllis Newman, Jane Krakowski, and Fisher Stevens. &quot;Pamela&#x27;s First Musical&quot;, written with Cy Coleman and David Zippel, based on Wasserstein&#x27;s children&#x27;s book, received its world premiere in a concert staging at Town Hall in New York City on May 18, 2008.

She wrote the libretto for the opera &quot;Best Friends&quot;, based on Clare Boothe Luce&#x27;s play &quot;The Women&quot;, but it was uncompleted when she died. It was subsequently completed by Christopher Durang, set by Deborah Drattell, and is in development with Lauren Flanigan.

In 1996 she appeared as the guest caller &quot;Linda&quot; on the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Head Game&quot;.

Wasserstein was named the President&#x27;s Council of Cornell Women Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large in 2005.

=== Personal life and death ===
Wasserstein gave birth to a daughter, Lucy Jane, in 1999 when she was 48 years old. The baby, who was conceived via in vitro fertilization, was three months premature and is recorded in Wasserstein&#x27;s collection of essays, &quot;Shiksa Goddess&quot;. Wasserstein, who was not married, never publicly identified her daughter&#x27;s father.

Wasserstein was hospitalized with lymphoma in December 2005 and died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on January 30, 2006, at age 55. News of her death was unexpected because her illness had not been widely publicized outside the theater community. The night after she died, Broadway&#x27;s lights were dimmed in her honor. In addition to her daughter, Wasserstein was survived by her mother and three siblings, Abner Wasserstein (who died 2011), businessman Bruce Wasserstein (who died in 2009), and Wilburton Inn owner Georgette Wasserstein Levis (who died in 2014).

<doc id="960485" wikidata="Q33448" url="?curid=960485" title="Kujargé language">
<text>The Kujargé language is spoken in seven villages in eastern Chad near Jebel Mirra (), and in villages scattered along the lower Wadi Salih and Wadi Azum in Darfur, Sudan. It is estimated to have about 1,000 speakers ().

==Background==
The name &quot;Kujargé&quot; (also spelled &quot;Kujarke&quot;) is derived from the Sudanese Arabic word (, &quot;sorcerer&quot;), due to the Kujarke&#x27;s reputation for practicing witchcraft among the Sinyar people.

The speakers were reported to live mainly by hunting and gathering due to the climate, terrain, and unstable seasonal water supply of the Dar Fongoro area being inhospitable for intensive agriculture and animal husbandry. Honey was one of their main foods obtained through foraging.

The Kujarge refer to themselves as Kujartenin Debiya. They are surrounded by the Daju-Galfigé to the west, the Sinyar to the north, and the Fur-Dalinga, Fongoro, Formono, and Runga to the east and south. Historically, they had been ruled by the Daju sultans, and may have been slaves of the Daju.

Also, Lebeuf (1959) reports that the Daju Nyala refer to the Darfur Birgid as &quot;Kajargé&quot;.

==Classification==
Kujarge is unclassified. It is known only from a by Doornbos (1981). These include Chadic words, but low numerals and pronouns look very un-Chadic. Blench (2008) notes that much of the basic vocabulary looks Cushitic, and speculates that Kujarge could even be a conservative language transitional between Chadic and Cushitic.

The language had been classified as a member of the Mubi subgroup of East Chadic by Paul Newman; however, Lionel Bender argued that its classification remained uncertain. There may have been a mix-up with Birgit, a nearby Mubi language which is also called Kujarge; when Newman was shown the 200-word list in 2006, he would not commit to it being Chadic.

In addition, there appears to be a large amount of vocabulary that has not been identified as Afro-Asiatic; there is a possibility that it is a language isolate that has been largely relexified by Chadic and Cushitic.

Blažek (2013) purports to show that Kujarge is an East Chadic language.

==Documentation and status==

In 1981, Dutch anthropologist Paul Doornbos had spent 4–5 hours eliciting a basic vocabulary list of Kujarke from a father and son (Arbab Yahia Basi, born Ndundra, who was 35 years old in 1981) in Ro Fatá, near Foro Boranga, Darfur. The first 100 words were elicited from the informant&#x27;s father, who was nearly deaf and had limited knowledge of Arabic, while the second 100 words were provided by the main informant, who may have mixed Kujarke with Daju and Fur. Part of the interview had also been done in Fur with the help of Doornbos&#x27; Fur research assistant. The two disagreed over the Kujarke elicitations, leading Doornbos to doubt the accuracy of the list. Doornbos also speculates that in 1981, Kujarke may have already been a dying language with few speakers left, although their population may have exceeded 1,000 people in 1981.

The father and son had also disagreed about the origins of the Kujarke people. According to the son, the Kujarke had originally lived in the mountain ranges to east of the Wadi Azum, namely the Jebel Kulli, Jebel Toya, Jebel Kunjaro, Jebel Turabu, Jebel Oromba, and Jebel Kire. Later, they were forced to migrate to Chad during the time of the Fur sultans. However, the father claimed that the original Kujarke homeland had only been in Chad.

Due to the war in Darfur, most Kujarke may now be living in refugee camps in the Goz Beïda and Dar Sila regions of eastern Chad. However, the Kujarke have not been recorded as a separate group by any government or foreign aid organization. As a result, Kujarke may have been passing themselves off as Daju or Fur. The first time the Kujarke had been mentioned in over 25 years was when French anthropologist Jerome Tubiana had interviewed a Daju village chief in Tiero. The chief of Tiero mentioned that a Kujarke village had been burned to the ground by the Janjaweed in 2007 during an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Daju people. Nothing else is known about the current state of the Kujarke people.

==Ethnic group==
The Kujarke lived in proximity with the Sinyar, Daju, and Fur peoples. Although the Kujarke were mostly endogamous, Sinyar men may have also intermarried with Kujarke women, as &quot;Kijaar&quot; was the name of one of the 18 Sinyar clans. The Kijaar clan was located closer to the core Kujarke area of Jebel Mirra than all of the other Sinyar clans.

The Kujarke are not Muslims and practice a secret religion that is yet unrecorded, as the Kujarke would lead visitors to a perimeter outside their village whenever they needed to perform their prayers.

==Phonology==
Judging by the one available wordlist, the consonants appear to be:

Relatively few consonant clusters are attested; they appear to all involve r+consonant or gemination (unless the prenasalized stops are to be seen as clusters.)

The vowels used in transcribing the same wordlist are: . It is not clear whether all of these are phonemically distinct; and , in particular, are rare.

==Grammar==
The pronouns include &quot;annu&quot; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;nigi&quot; &quot;you (sg.)&quot;. Interrogative pronouns include &quot;ŋgayna&quot; &quot;what?&quot;, &quot;ye&quot; &quot;who?&quot;. Demonstratives include &quot;agu&quot; &quot;this&quot;.

The numbers include:
#&quot;kirre&quot;
#&quot;kurro&quot;
#&quot;ubo&quot;

<doc id="960487" wikidata="Q7288055" url="?curid=960487" title="Ralph Sadler">
<text>Sir Ralph Sadler or Sadleir PC, Knight banneret (1507 – 30 March 1587) was an English statesman, who served Henry VIII as Privy Councillor, Secretary of State and ambassador to Scotland. Sadler went on to serve Edward VI. Having signed the device settling the crown on Jane Grey in 1553, he was obliged to retire to his estates during the reign of Mary I. Sadler was restored to royal favour during the reign of Elizabeth I, serving as a Privy Councillor and once again participating in Anglo-Scottish diplomacy. He was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in May 1568.

==Family and early life==
Ralph Sadler was born in Hackney, Middlesex, the elder son of Henry Sadler, a minor official in the service of the Marquess of Dorset and Sir Edward Belknap. Henry Sadler was originally from Warwickshire, but later settled in Hackney. Ralph had a brother, John, who commanded a company at the Siege of Boulogne in 1544.

At around seven years of age, Sadler was placed in the household of Thomas Cromwell, later Earl of Essex, where he received an excellent education. He was taught to read and write, becoming fluent in French, Latin and Greek, and acquired a working knowledge of the law. He proved to be not only intelligent and resourceful but also capable of great feats of horsemanship and was skilled at falconry.

Roger Ascham compared Sadler&#x27;s appearance in terms of complexion, countenance and beard to Duke Maurice, although the Duke was taller. Sadler is also represented by his tomb effigy at Standon, and he may have been painted by Hans Holbein the Younger in 1535.

== Courtier and diplomat ==
Sadler began his career as secretary to Thomas Cromwell and went on to serve four Tudor monarchs. During his long career in royal service, he held many offices, including:
* Clerk of the Hanaper 1535–1587
* Gentleman of the Privy Chamber by May 1536
* Ambassador to Scotland 1537, 1540, 1542
* Jointly (with John Godsalve, Gregory Railton and Francis Kempe) prothonotary, Chancery 1537 – 1587?
* Principal Secretary April 1540 – April 1543

===In the service of Cromwell and the King, 1526 to 1539===
By the time he was 19 Sadler was serving as Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s secretary, learning about administration, finance and politics. In this role, he handled Cromwell&#x27;s household business and was also involved in drafting and writing his correspondence. By 1529 he had become one of Cromwell&#x27;s most trusted friends and was appointed an executor of his will. Between 1525 and 1529, his name appeared in Cromwell&#x27;s correspondence in connection with the suppression of monasteries. It was probably around this time that his talents came to the attention of the king. He was granted the manor and lands from the suppressed St Leonard&#x27;s Priory in Bow.

It was probably soon after Cromwell&#x27;s elevation to the peerage, on 9 July 1536, that Sadler was named a gentleman of the Privy Chamber. In the same year, he became MP for Hindon, Wiltshire and his name also appears in the list of administrators named for Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s will.

In January 1537, Sadler was sent to Scotland to investigate complaints made by Margaret Tudor, the King&#x27;s sister, against her third husband, Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, and to improve Anglo-Scottish relations. He succeeded in both respects. On 1 April 1537, Ralph met James V of Scotland, newly married to Madeleine of Valois, at Rouen.

The King was pleased with Sadler&#x27;s work and sent him again to Scotland, this time to discourage the King of Scotland, James V, from accepting Cardinal Beaton&#x27;s proposed Franco-Scottish alliance. Sadler failed in that respect, but the King was nonetheless impressed with his work. As a New Year&#x27;s Day gift in 1539, Sadler gave Henry VIII a gold signet ring with a dial. Later in that year, he was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Middlesex.

In 1535 Sadler built Sutton House in Hackney, It is a red-brick, three-storey H-plan structure. Sadler sold the house and surrounding estate to John Machell, a cloth merchant, in 1550, having built a grander house, Standon Lordship, in Hertfordshire. 

In 1576, Thomas Avery of Berden, Essex, bequeathed to Sadler a gold table or locket with an image of Cromwell, a reminder of his old master who was executed in July 1540.

=== Mr. Secretary: Henry VIII and Edward VI, 1540 to 1557 ===

In April 1540 Sadler was made principal secretary to the king, a position he held jointly with Thomas Wriothesley. In the same year, he was knighted, made a privy councillor, and began more than 30 years of service representing Hertfordshire in Parliament. He represented Preston in 1545.

Sadler survived the fall from power and subsequent execution of his friend and mentor in 1540; however, during the power struggle following Cromwell&#x27;s demise, he was arrested and sent to the Tower. On the evening of 17 January 1541, the Imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, and the French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, reported to their masters that Sir Ralph Sadler and Sir Thomas Wyatt had been arrested, as had another courtier Sir John Wallop. The following morning they were taken from Hampton Court, with their hands bound, accompanied by 24 archers, to the Tower. Marillac noted that it &quot;must be some great matter&quot; for Wyatt &quot;has for enemies all who leagued against Cromwell, whose minion he was.&quot;

Sadler was able to clear himself and was released in a few days, returning to the council chamber. He played a leading role in the examination of Catherine Howard and her relatives in November 1541, regained the King&#x27;s trust, and was knighted for his part in holding matters of state while the court went on a summer progress of the North in a tripartite ministry with Lords Audley and Hertford. Together with his allies in the council, notably Thomas Cranmer, Sadler gathered evidence in an unsuccessful attempt to discredit Norfolk and Gardiner, the men who had orchestrated Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s downfall.

=== From courtier to career diplomat: mission to Scotland ===
Sadler was sent to Scotland several times. In 1540 he tried to embarrass and undermine the authority of Cardinal Beaton, an ally of France, with letters captured from his messenger Alexander Crichton of Brunstane whose ship had been forced by a storm to put into England. However, James V of Scotland refused to accept that the letters were compromising, and argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King&#x27;s own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Sadler compared the captured letters with Beaton&#x27;s copies and found a discrepancy. James V said he was thankful to Sadler and his uncle Henry VIII but still would not find fault in the Cardinal&#x27;s actions.

Following the Battle of Solway Moss, Sadler was sent to Scotland again, in March 1543, to arrange a marriage between the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, and Edward, Prince of Wales. He was a successful negotiator for the Treaty of Greenwich, although the marriage was not concluded. On 22 March 1543, he rode from Edinburgh to Linlithgow Palace to see the queen for the first time. Mary of Guise asked the nurse Jean Sinclair to show him the queen out of her swaddling clothes. The scene was depicted by a 19th-century artist Benjamin Haydon. Sadler wrote that the infant was &quot;as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live&quot;. Mary of Guise reminded him that in turn Regent Arran wanted his son James Hamilton to marry Princess Elizabeth. Mary tried to work on him to intercede for Regent Arran to release Cardinal Beaton from imprisonment, alleging the Cardinal&#x27;s political expertise could be employed to mutual benefit. Henry VIII wanted English servants in Mary&#x27;s household, and Sadler recommended &quot;Lady Edongcomb&quot; for this role, his friend, Katherine Edgcumbe the widow of Peter Edgecumbe of Cotehele.

Sadler closely followed a controversy at Linlithgow between Arran and Cardinal Beaton in July 1543. When an agreement was reached, the Earl of Lennox escorted Mary to Stirling Castle. On 9 August 1543 Sadler wrote to Henry VIII describing his visit to Mary of Guise and the infant Queen;&quot;(Mary of Guise) is very glad that she is at Stirling, and much she praised there about the house, and told me, &quot;That her daughter did grow apace; and soon,&quot; she said, &quot;she would be a woman, if she took of her mother;&quot; who indeed, is of the largest stature of women. And therefore she caused also the child to be brought to me, to the intent I might see her, assuring your majesty, that she is a right fair and goodly child, as any that I have seen for her age.&quot;

By November Sadler, fearing for his safety as the mood in Edinburgh turned against England, moved to Tantallon Castle, which belonged to the Earl of Angus. Regent Arran sent the Rothesay Herald to Tantallon, ordering him to return Sadler to England, having &quot;seen daily his great practices made to seduce and corrupt true faithful subjects of this realm to the opinion of England.&quot; The Earl&#x27;s kinsmen conveyed him to Berwick upon Tweed on 11 December 1543. All of his work in solidifying Anglo-Scottish relations came to nothing, and war followed after the Scottish rejection of Treaty of Greenwich in December 1543.

Sadler was replaced by William Paget as Secretary of State in April 1543, owing to his frequent absences on diplomatic missions, but was appointed Master of the Great Wardrobe. He was treasurer for the war against Scotland with the Earl of Hertford during his punitive expedition to Edinburgh in May 1544. Sadler accompanied Hertford into Scotland, in the same role in September 1545. He accompanied Lord Hertford again, this time at the Battle of Pinkie in the post of High Treasurer of the Army. On 10 September 1547, in recognition of his services during the fighting, Sadler was made a knight banneret.

Sadler was present when Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, was arrested, and he also accompanied the force that put down Robert Kett&#x27;s Norfolk Rebellion. When Henry VIII was preparing his will on Boxing Day 1546, he had already appointed Sadler onto the Council of Regency that was to rule England during Edward VI&#x27;s minority and left him £200 in his will.

In 1550 Sadler sold his mansion at Hackney. He was one of the signatories of Edward VI&#x27;s will in 1553, proving one of the radicals in a Protestant government. He signed the device settling the crown on the Protestant Jane Grey, and was noted by Lord Burghley as one of those expected to act on her behalf.

=== Mary I and Elizabeth I, 1558 to 1587 ===

On the accession of the Catholic Mary I to the throne, after the resolution of the succession crisis, Sadler lost most of his offices, including master of the great wardrobe, he was removed from the commissions of the peace and excluded from the Privy Council. He was briefly under house arrest from 25 to 30 July 1553 before being granted a pardon on 6 October. For the rest of Mary I&#x27;s reign he did not sit in any parliament, remaining in semi-retirement at Standon, Hertfordshire.

During the reign of Elizabeth I, restored to royal favour, Sadler was sent to Scotland on 8 August 1559 to arrange an alliance with the Scottish Protestants, and forward the cause of the Lords of the Congregation and Duke of Chatelherault. After the English became directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Leith, he was one of the architects of the Treaty of Edinburgh. In 1568 he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

=== Mary, Queen of Scots ===
When Mary, Queen of Scots, fled to England in 1568 after the battle of Langside, Sadler was unwillingly appointed to meet with the Scottish commissioners regarding that problem. Sadler was keeper of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Sheffield in 1572 during the absence of the Earl of Shrewsbury at court. He was sent to arrest the Duke of Norfolk in Scotland in 1572 following the Rising of the North.

Sadler was again reluctantly appointed gaoler of Mary, Queen of Scots, from the summer 1584 to spring 1585, when she was housed at Wingfield Manor and Tutbury Castle. Mary&#x27;s secretary Gilbert Curle, devised a code that seemed to include Sadler as the &quot;carrier&quot; and his assistant John Somers as the &quot;carrier&#x27;s man&quot;. An intercepted letter appeared to compromise Somers, and Sadler vouched for his loyalty to Francis Walsingham. 

During Mary&#x27;s time with Sadler, Elizabeth was nervous about Mary&#x27;s plans against her. Sadler reported that the guards at Sheffield and Wingfield carried swords and daggers, pistols, halberds and partisans. He was instructed to restrict Mary&#x27;s freedom. Walsingham chided Sadler and Somers for letting Mary ride from Tutbury to go &quot;hawkyng&quot; and for giving her &quot;more lybertye now then at any tyme when she was in the E of Shrewsbury chardge&quot;.

According to Andrea Clarke, there was &quot;a tangible, palpable sense of heightened levels of fear among Elizabeth&#x27;s government and ministers about her safety in the midst of the danger posed by Mary Queen of Scots, who for many Catholics was a figurehead&quot;. Sadler was required to post guards round the castle and to search the grounds &quot;once or twice a moneth&quot;. After the Babington Plot, Sadler was on the council that sentenced Mary to death.

==Marriage and issue==
Around 1534, Ralph Sadler married Ellen, daughter of John Mitchell, of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, who at the time of their marriage was believed to be the widow of Matthew Barre (or Barrow) of Sevenoaks in Kent. The couple had three sons and four daughters:

* Sir Thomas Sadler of Standon, Hertfordshire, (c. 1536 – 1607), named after Thomas Cromwell, who succeeded him married twice:
:* Ursula, daughter of Sir Henry Sherington of Lacock, Wiltshire
:* Gertrude, daughter of Robert Markham, of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, by whom he had a son Ralph, and a daughter Gertrude, who married Walter Aston, 1st Lord Aston of Forfar. On Ralph&#x27;s death in 1661, Standon passed to Gertrude&#x27;s son, Walter.
* Edward Sadler of Temple Dinsley, (died 4 April 1584) married Anne, daughter and heir of Sir Richard Lee of Sopwell, Hertfordshire
* Henry Sadler of Everleigh, Wiltshire, (c. 1538 – 1618), married twice:
:* Mary, daughter of Gilbert Everley
:* Ursula, daughter of John Gill
* Anne Sadler (died 1576), married George Horsey of Digswell, Hertfordshire
* Mary Sadler married Thomas Bolle of Wallington, Hertfordshire
* Jane Sadler (died c. 1587), married Edward Baeshe of Stansted Bury, Hertfordshire.
* Dorothy Sadler (died c. 1578), married Edward Elrington of Byrchall, Essex

Sadler may have had an illegitimate son, Richard.

===The return of Matthew Barre===

More than eleven years after Ralph and Ellen had married, Matthew Barre returned alive from Ireland and was overheard in a London tavern claiming to be the lawful husband of Sadler&#x27;s wife. Ralph and his wife had seven surviving children, and he was now a very wealthy and influential person at court whose reputation was at stake. Sadler, a man devoted to his wife and children, was informed of the matter in October 1545 while on a diplomatic mission in Scotland. &quot;Master Sadler took his matter very heavily,&quot; the Lord Chancellor, Wriothesley reported to Secretary Paget.

Ellen Mitchell and Matthew Barre had been legally married in 1526, in Great Dunmow in Essex. They had two daughters before Barre abandoned them and went to Ireland. Ellen stayed in Dunmow for about a year trying to find out where he had gone. She then became a servant of the prioress at the nunnery of Clerkenwell. Determined to find Matthew, she visited his birthplace and with his brothers made further enquiries, but without success. Despairing of an answer she returned to Clerkenwell. Not long afterwards a man belonging to the city of Salisbury positively assured her that her husband was dead. Recommended by the Prioress of Clerkenwell, Ellen entered the service of Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s mother-in-law, Mercy Pryor, and was dwelling in his house when Ralph Sadler became enamoured of her. Ralph Sadler and Ellen married believing that Matthew Barre was dead.

A version of Ellen&#x27;s story was given by an Elizabethan writer, Nicholas Sanders, and attempted to cast doubt on her character, without success. Sanders claimed that Ellen (née Mitchell) was related to Thomas Cromwell, and that she had worked for him in his household. Given that Cromwell was known to take pity on widows, this is not unlikely. The 17th-century historian Gilbert Burnet considered that Sanders&#x27; story was a fiction. Sanders was a Jesuit, a Catholic recusant writing with an agenda. He took delight in attempting to discredit leading public figures in England. There was no scandal surrounding the marriage between Ellen and Ralph when it took place. Cromwell&#x27;s paternal aunt was Margaret Mitchell, and Ellen may have been a relative of Margaret and her husband William, or William&#x27;s brother Thomas, all of whom once lived with and worked for Walter Cromwell. Rather than slandering Ellen and Ralph, this shows a friendly familial beginning.
An investigation found that Ellen&#x27;s first marriage was valid, and Sadler was therefore obliged to have his children legitimised by a private act of Parliament. In 1546, this act of Parliament, (37 Hen. 8. c. &quot;30&quot; ) was passed on his behalf. The act set aside Ellen&#x27;s marriage to Matthew Barre and made her marriage to Ralph Sadler a true and proper union. Sadler managed to prevent the publication of the act and its details never appeared among the statutes of the period. The only known contemporary reference to the act appears in a transcript entitled &quot;The Unprecedented Case of Sir Ralph Sadleir&quot; in the Library of the Inner Temple. Matthew Barre disappeared from the scene.

This episode damaged Sadler&#x27;s reputation, but not irretrievably. His marriage to Ellen was saved and the couple lived on, without further incident, for many years. Sadler&#x27;s wife was still living in 1569; however, there is no further record of her and there is no surviving tomb for her.

== Death ==
Sir Ralph Sadler died 30 March 1587, reputedly, &quot;the richest commoner in England&quot;. His tomb lies beneath a magnificent wall monument in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Standon, Hertfordshire. 

Sadler left the majority of his vast landholdings, including Standon and Buntingford, Hertfordshire, to his eldest son and heir, Thomas Sadler. Henry Sadler received the manors of Hungerford, Berkshire, and Everley, Wiltshire, Jane Bash received a diamond ring and an annuity was provided for Richard Sadler.

==Works==

Sadler is one of the few Renaissance statesmen for whom extant Parliamentary orations survive, including a speech on succession in 1563 and one on subsidy in 1566. Copies of the orations appear in the 1809 two-volume publication of his letters, which includes a biography by Walter Scott.

==Fictional portrayals==

Sadler is one of the major characters in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, which gives a fictional portrayal of Sadler&#x27;s youth and early manhood in the household of Thomas Cromwell. He also appears prominently in &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot; and &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;, Mantel&#x27;s sequels to &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;. During the BBC TV series &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, Sadler is portrayed by Thomas Brodie-Sangster. 

He is also a minor character in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s book &quot;The Other Queen&quot;, with an account given of the time he spent as gaoler of Mary, Queen of Scots.

<text>The House of Della Scala, whose members were known as Scaligeri () or Scaligers (; from the Latinized &quot;de Scalis&quot;), was the ruling family of Verona and mainland Veneto (except for Venice) from 1262 to 1387, for a total of 125 years.

== History ==
When Ezzelino III was elected &quot;podestà&quot; of the commune in 1226, he was able to convert the office into a permanent lordship. Upon his death the Great Council elected as podestà Mastino I, who succeeded in converting the &quot;signoria&quot; (seigniory) into a family inheritance, governing at first with the acquiescence of the commune, then, when they failed to re-elect him in 1262, he effected a coup d&#x27;état and was acclaimed (&quot;people&#x27;s captain&quot;), at the head of the commune&#x27;s troops. In 1277 Mastino was killed by a faction of the nobles. The reign of his son Alberto as &quot;capitano&quot; (1277–1302) was an incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his three sons, Cangrande I inherited the podestà position in 1308, only the last shared the government (1308) and made a name as warrior, prince and patron of Dante, Petrarch and Giotto. By war or treaty he brought under his control the cities of Padua (1328), Treviso (1329), and Vicenza.
Cangrande I was succeeded by his nephews Mastino II (1329–1351) and Alberto. Mastino, the richest and most powerful prince of his generation in Italy, continued his uncle&#x27;s policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Po river. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). A powerful league was formed against him in 1337: Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este and the Gonzaga all joined, and after a three-year war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza.

His son Cangrande II (1351–1359) was a cruel and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with German mercenaries, but was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359–1375), who beautified Verona with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide among the Scaligeri continued when Antonio (1375–1387), Cansignorio&#x27;s natural son, slew his brother Bartolomeo. This aroused the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight (19 October 1387), thus ending the Scaliger domination.
His son Can Francesco attempted fruitlessly to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate: with the support of the people, he drove out the Milanese, but he died ten days thereafter, and Verona then submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular uprisings. After the Scaligeri had been ousted, two self-proclaimed members of the family, Giulio Cesare della Scala (also known as Julius Caesar Scaliger) and his son Joseph Justus Scaliger, made a reputation as humanist scholars, though their relationship to the historic Scaliger family is disputed. Guglielmo&#x27;s sons dispersed widely: went to Germany, while followed an ecclesiastical career, becoming Bishop of Freising; most of the siblings died and were buried in Vienna. married Amalia von Frauenberg and founded the Bavarian branch of the family, which survived until 1598.

The church of &quot;Santa Maria Antica&quot; in Verona is surrounded with the tombs (&quot;arche&quot;) of the Scaligeri in the form of Gothic shrines, or &quot;tempietti&quot;, enclosing their sarcophagi: Cangrande della Scala is memorialized with an equestrian statue; Cansignorio by a marble Gothic monument by Bonino da Campione, 1374.

<text>Alien Front Online is a 2001 video game released for the Dreamcast. It is an online version of the arcade game Alien Front, where it was bundled with the Microphone accessory. It was only released in North America.

The game was brought back online by fans through private servers in 2016.

== Gameplay ==

In the game, players use armored vehicles to fight battles staged in arenas. Players can choose which side to fight for; the Triclops or the military. Players can also choose one of three different vehicles, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Although the game is fully playable for one person, it was primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each side) can play. Players move around the arena attempting to shoot each other, while also looking for power-ups for their vehicles. The game is played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills are declared the winners.

== Development ==
Art director Gerardo Sprigg was working at Acclaim&#x27;s struggling coin-op division on &quot;,&quot; and before the studio closed, Sega employees paid a visit looking to buy arcade projects or people to recruit. Several months passed, when Sprigg received an email from Makoto Uchida, who had a small Japanese development team that were living in the US and working at Sega of America. Uchida&#x27;s boss had mandated him to find some Americans to work with, with the idea to make their titles feel more American. Sprigg and Uchida met, where it was decided that the old Acclaim art team would reunite and join Wow Entertainment in the US to work on a new project that would appeal to American audiences. Uchida was a big fan of &quot;Tokyo Wars&quot; which was popular in arcades, and wanted to create a vehicle game as he noticed that people enjoyed cabinets with steering wheels and pedals. In contrast to &quot;Tokyo Wars&quot;, Uchida was adamant on including destructible environments. During development, someone had suggested a premise of the US military fighting off an alien invasion, which the Americans liked but the Japanese were somewhat sceptical. Once a functional demo was running, testing for the &quot;Alien Front&quot; arcade game began in several California locations, and the game was brought to E3 2000, where it appeared to be fairly popular, despite being in the back corner of the Sega booth. Following the success of the cabinet, a home port was planned. New levels were added to the Dreamcast version, and online connectivity between the arcade and Dreamcast versions was even considered, but because the arcade never released outside Japan, the feature was scrapped.

== Release ==
&quot;Alien Front&quot; was released exclusively in Japanese arcades on January 23, 2001, and &quot;Alien Front Online&quot; was released on the Dreamcast exclusively in North America August 7, 2001. It was originally slated for release in Japan, but was cancelled. Copies of &quot;Alien Front Online&quot; were packaged with the Microphone accessory due to poor sales of &quot;Seaman&quot;. A related game, simply titled &quot;Alien Front&quot;, was announced by Sega for the N-Gage in 2004, but was eventually cancelled. A prototype ROM image of the N-Gage version was leaked online in 2019.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Rob Smolka of &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that the game was &quot;not terribly original, but the basics are solid enough to make it fun, especially when you can taunt your foes and coordinate your attack with teammates online&quot;.

<text>Square Leg was a 1980 British government home defence Command Post and field exercise, which tested the Transition to War and Home Defence roles of the Ministry of Defence and British government. Part of the exercise involved a mock nuclear attack on Britain. It was assumed that 131 nuclear weapons would fall on Britain with a total yield of 205 megatons (69 ground burst; 62 air burst) with yields of 500 kt to 3 Mt. That was felt to be a reasonably realistic scenario, but the report stated that a total strike in excess of 1,000 megatons would be likely. The ratio of ground bursts to air bursts was increased to provide all the regional NBC cells with radioactive fallout challenges. Furthermore, the scenario was altered from official assessments as these were highly classified and many participants did not have the appropriate clearance to see them.

Mortality was estimated at 29 million (53 percent of the population), serious injuries at 7 million (12 percent), and short-term survivors at 19 million (35 percent).

Square Leg was criticised for a number of reasons: the weapons used were exclusively in the high-yield megaton range, with an average of 1.5 Mt per bomb, but a realistic attack based on known Soviet capabilities would have seen mixed weapons yields, including many missile-based warheads in the low-hundred-kiloton range. Also, no targets in Inner London were attacked (for example, Whitehall, the centre of British government), though collateral damage from strikes on Outer London targets and on Potters Bar and Ongar meant that much of the Inner London area was still destroyed; towns such as Eastbourne were hit for no obvious reason. All government and military bunkers were assumed to have survived for exercise purposes, although Kelvedon Hatch Sub-Regional Headquarters had difficulty in establishing regional control. In addition, the exercise only covered Great Britain, with Northern Ireland being ignored. The United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation was not a &quot;live&quot; participant, with the strike data it would have provided instead being pre-recorded and played into the exercise as it proceeded, an aspect that was criticised by participants after the exercise. 

The Lothian Regional Council refused to participate in Square Leg, and the exercise came under journalistic scrutiny after its details were leaked to the press, but otherwise it was not met with significant opposition in the way that the later Hard Rock exercise would be.

<text>Messier 19 or M19 (also designated NGC 6273) is a globular cluster in the constellation Ophiuchus. It was discovered by Charles Messier on June 5, 1764 and added to his catalogue of comet-like objects that same year. It was resolved into individual stars by William Herschel in 1784. His son, John Herschel, described it as &quot;a superb cluster resolvable into countless stars&quot;. The cluster is located 4.5° WSW of Theta Ophiuchi and is just visible as a fuzzy point of light using binoculars. Using a telescope with a aperture, the cluster shows an oval appearance with a core and a halo.

M19 is one of the most oblate of the known globular clusters. This flattening may not accurately reflect the physical shape of the cluster because the emitted light is being strongly absorbed along the eastern edge. This is the result of extinction caused by intervening gas and dust. When viewed in the infrared, the cluster shows almost no flattening. It lies at a distance of about from the Solar System, and is quite near to the Galactic Center at only about away.

This cluster contains an estimated 1,100,000 times the mass of the Sun and it is around 11.9 billion years old. The stellar population includes four Cepheids and RV Tauri variables, plus at least one RR Lyrae variable for which a period is known. Observations made during the ROSAT mission failed to reveal any low-intensity X-ray sources.

<doc id="960530" wikidata="Q5875054" url="?curid=960530" title="Hobie Billingsley">
<text>Hobart Sherwood Billingsley (December 2, 1926 – July 16, 2022) was an American diver for Ohio State University and a Hall of Fame coach for Indiana University from 1959-1989, where he led the Hoosiers to six NCAA national swimming and diving team championships. During his time with Indiana, he coached the U.S. Olympic diving team in 1968, 1972, and 1976.

==Early life==
Billingsley was born to James and Wenonah (Willing) Billingsley in Erie, Pennsylvania, on December 2, 1926. He taught himself how to dive by analyzing wallcharts at his local YMCA. During his final year of high school in 1943, he finished in third place at the national championships. 

Billingsley attended Ohio State University (OSU), where he won the NCAA one-and three-meter titles during his freshman year in 1945. After putting his studies on hold to enlist in the United States Armed Forces, Billingsley served in Japan during World War II before completing his studies at OSU. He subsequently undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Washington and obtained a master&#x27;s degree.

==Career==
Billingsley first worked as a high school teacher and coach. He was the swimming and diving coach at Allen Park High School in Wayne County, Michigan from 1955 to 1957, where he built a swimming program that led to the Michigan High School Boys State Championship. He was subsequently recruited by James Counsilman, the head swimming coach at Indiana University who created the new position of diving coach for Billingsley.

===Dive coaching===
Billingsley served as the Indiana Hoosiers’s diving coach from 1959 to 1989, leading the Hoosiers to six NCAA and 23 Big Ten team championships. 

During his time at Indiana, he coached the United States Olympic diving team at the 1968, 1972, and 1976 Summer Games. Divers under his tutelage won 115 national diving titles and seven Olympic medals. His Olympic gold and bronze medalists include Lesley Bush, Kenneth Sitzberger, Mark Lenzi (twice), Cynthia Potter, Edwin Young, and Jim Henry. Billingsley coached diver Russ Bertram at Indiana from 1986-1989, a talented diver who would have an accomplished career as an Olympic and collegiate dive coach with the University of Arizona from 2006-2013, and with Denison University after 2013. He later established the World Diving Coaches Association in 1968 and the American Coaches Diving Association two years later. He was regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of diving. He was profiled in the award-winning and widely televised documentary &quot;Hobie’s Heroes — 25th Anniversary Edition&quot;, which depicts the struggles and successes of young divers training under this legendary coach. The title was derived from the nickname he gave to his divers.

==Later life==
Following retirement from university coaching, Billingsley continued to be active in the sport, training divers and coaches around the world, and was a respected speaker on diving history, technique, ethics, and general sports. His book &quot;Diving Illustrated&quot;, a seminal work offering detailed technical support for coaching diving, was released in 1990, with the second edition published in 2018.

==Personal life==
Billingsley married Mary Drake in 1952, whom he met in college. The couple had three children.

He was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis in July 2018 and hospitalized. He died on July 16, 2022, in Bloomington, at age 95.

==Honors and awards==
Billingsley was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1989. He was given the Sammy Lee Award, the most esteemed award in diving, in 1994. That same year, he was enshrined in the Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame. At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics, he took the oath on behalf of all judges. The Counsilman–Billingsley Aquatics Center at Indiana University is named in his honor, as is an award bestowed by the Indiana High School Swimming and Diving Hall of Fame.

<text>In painting, imprimatura is an initial stain of color painted on a ground. It provides a painter with a transparent, toned ground, which will allow light falling onto the painting to reflect through the paint layers. The term itself stems from the Italian and literally means &quot;first paint layer&quot;. Its use as an underpainting layer can be dated back to the guilds and workshops during the Middle Ages; however, it came into standard use by painters during the Renaissance, particularly in Italy.
The imprimatura not only provides an overall tonal optical unity in a painting but is also useful in the initial stages of the work, since it helps the painter establish value relations from dark to light. It is most useful in the classical approach of indirect painting, where the drawing and underpainting are established ahead of time and allowed to dry. The successive layers of color are then applied in transparent glaze or semi-transparent layers.

Care is taken not to cover the imprimatura completely allowing it to show through the final paint layers; this is effective in particular in the middle to dark shadow areas of the work. 

An imprimatura is usually made with an earth pigment such as raw sienna, and is often diluted with turpentine.

The term &quot;imprimatura&quot; should not be confused with &quot;imprimatur&quot;, a term used in editing.

<text>Share-alike (🄎) is a copyright licensing term, originally used by the Creative Commons project, to describe works or licenses that require copies or adaptations of the work to be released under the same or similar license as the original. Copyleft licenses are free content or free software licenses with a share-alike condition.

Two currently-supported Creative Commons licenses have the ShareAlike condition: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (a copyleft, free content license) and Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (a proprietary license).

The term has also been used outside copyright law to refer to a similar plan for patent licensing.

==Copyleft==
Copyleft or libre share-alike licenses are the largest subcategory of share-alike licenses. They include both free content licenses like Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike and free software licenses like the GNU General Public License. These licenses have been described pejoratively as viral licenses, because the inclusion of copyleft material in a larger work typically requires the entire work to be made copyleft. The term reciprocal license has also been used to describe copyleft, but has also been used for non-libre licenses (see, for example, the Microsoft Limited Reciprocal License).

Free content and software licenses without the share-alike requirement are described as permissive licenses.

==Creative Commons==
As with all six licenses in the current Creative Commons suite, CC Attribution-ShareAlike and CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike require attribution. According to Creative Commons, the advantage of this license is that future users are not able to add new restrictions to a derivative of your work; their derivatives must be licensed the same way.

The 3.0 and 4.0 version of the ShareAlike licenses include a compatibility clause, allowing Creative Commons to declare other licenses as compatible and therefore derivatives may use these instead of the license of the original work.

===Version history===

<text>The SEA IV was a French two-seat military aircraft of World War I and the immediate post-war era.

==Development==
The SEA IV was designed and built in 1917 by Henry Potez, Louis Coroller, and Marcel Bloch. It was a derivative of their previous SEA II design, equipped with a more powerful Lorraine engine of 261 kW (350 hp). It made its first flight during the first quarter of 1918, probably near Plessis-Belleville. It was initially tested by Gustave Douchy, a flying ace of 9 victories, then by the pilots of the Centre d&#x27;essais en Vol at Villacoublay. The &quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Armement et des Fabrications de guerre&quot; (Ministry of Armament and War Production) soon placed an order for 1,000 machines, making the SEA IV the first Dassault-designed aircraft to reach production.

==Operational history==
On August 24, 1918, General Duval, commander of Aéronautique at General Headquarters foresaw the need for two variants to equip the escadrilles at the beginning of 1919: the SEA IV A2 for observation and the SEA IV C2 for fighting. In October, General Headquarters ordered the commissioning of a flotilla to operate these aircraft, and therefore required production to reach 200 planes per month during the first quarter of 1919, to have a force of 400 on hand by April 1.

The Armistice, however, meant that the initial order of 1,000 was cancelled, and in the end, only 115 examples were built. These C2s were used for a number of years by several escadrilles in the &quot;Regiments d&#x27;Aviation&quot; at Le Bourget.

A further 25 were built by Aéroplanes Henry Potez as the Potez VII, a luxury touring aircraft, and one further example formed the basis of a racing aircraft.

==Variants==
;SEA IV: Basic production variant
;SEA IV P.M.:A long-distance aircraft with additional fuel tanks giving an endurance of 6 hours.
;SEA IV floatplane: Under construction at the time of the Armistice in November 1918

<text>As the capital and largest city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo is naturally the main center of the country&#x27;s media. Most of the country&#x27;s major television channels are based in the city, as are the most popular newspapers and magazines.

Newspapers are the most popular and most well established forms of media. The two most popular and credible daily newspapers are the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; and the &quot;Dnevni avaz&quot;, The buildings of both of these are adjacent to each other, situated in Novi Grad municipality, making the spot the center of the Bosnian media world.

The &quot;Dnevni avaz&quot; (the Daily Voice) is today the more successful of the two. It was claimed to have ties with the powerful Party of Democratic Action, which some take to explain its success. Later however it shifted its supported among the other parties. The &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; is the older and more well known of the two. Meaning &quot;The Liberation&quot;, it was established in Sarajevo following World War II as the communist party&#x27;s newspaper. Oslobođenje preserved somewhat leftist views. &quot;Novi Plamen&quot;, a monthly magazine, is the most left-wing publication currently.

Infostaza is the first newspaper in Bosnia and Herzegovina that is published exclusively online. It offers a wide range of daily news and current topics.

As well as professional newspapers, Sarajevo is also home to a variety of magazines and political tabloids, such as &quot;Slobodna Bosna&quot;, &quot;Dani&quot;, and &quot;Walter&quot;, all of which have a high circulation.

Television is very popular in Sarajevo, even though for most people the number of channels is somewhat limited. Satellites allow for a number of foreign channels to be watched, but the most popular are the local news stations based in the city. Federalna televizija (FTV) is the television of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, while there is also a national radio-television system named Public Broadcast Service of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A Sarajevo Cantonal channel is also available.

After the government affiliated channels there are several other television stations, perhaps the most prominent being Hayat TV. Another is the Open Broadcast Network, a television station founded by the International community, now privately owned. Television stations from Croatia are also available, as is Serbian Eastern European media giant RTV Pink, with Pink BH Company, the local branch based in Bijeljina.

Many small independent radio stations exist, although the majority listen to the more established ones such as Radio M, Radio Grad, eFM Student Radio and RSG. RSG, Radio Stari Grad (Radio Old Town) is the most popular of these. Radio Free Europe can still be heard, and several American and West European stations are available for listening as well. Also popular is Radio 202, affiliated with FTV.

<doc id="960545" wikidata="Q5433849" url="?curid=960545" title="Fangoria">
<text>Fangoria is an internationally distributed American horror film fan magazine, in publication since 1979. It is published four times a year by Fangoria Publishing, LLC and is edited by Phil Nobile Jr.

The magazine was originally released in an age when horror fandom was still a burgeoning subculture; in the late 1970s, most horror publications were concerned with classic cinema, while those that focused on contemporary horror were largely fanzines. &quot;Fangoria&quot; rose to prominence by running exclusive interviews with horror filmmakers and offering behind-the-scenes photos and stories that were otherwise unavailable to fans in the era before the Internet. The magazine would eventually rise to become a force itself in the horror world, hosting its own awards show, sponsoring and hosting numerous horror conventions, producing films, and printing its own line of comics.

&quot;Fangoria&quot; began struggling in the 2010s due to issues arising from the internet, including difficulty in generating enough ad revenue to cover printing costs. Publication became sporadic beginning in fall 2015, and the magazine ran through a succession of editors in 2015–2016, culminating with the February 2017 announcement of Ken Hanley&#x27;s December 2016 departure. After this, the magazine ceased publication. The magazine remained dormant throughout 2017.

In February 2018, Dallas-based entertainment company Cinestate bought &quot;Fangoria&quot; and, under new editor-in-chief Phil Nobile Jr., relaunched the magazine as a print-based quarterly publication. In October 2018, Cinestate released the first new &quot;Fangoria&quot; magazine under their ownership, stylized as &quot;Volume 2, Issue 1.&quot;

In August 2020, Tara Ansley and Abhi Goel acquired &quot;Fangoria&quot; from Cinestate under Fangoria Publishing, LLC, and, as of issue 9, are the publishers of the magazine and owners of the brand.

==Origins==
Kerry O&#x27;Quinn and Norman Jacobs first conceived of &quot;Fangoria&quot; in 1978 by under the name &quot;Fantastica&quot; as a companion to their science fiction media magazine &quot;Starlog&quot;. Just as &quot;Starlog&quot; covered science fiction films for a primarily teenaged audience, &quot;Fantastica&quot; was intended to cover fantasy films for a similar audience. O&#x27;Quinn, who had previously published soap opera fan magazines, anticipated a groundswell of interest in the fantasy genre due to Hollywood&#x27;s plan to bring Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Conan the Barbarian to the screen, although that movie would not appear for another four years.

The first issue was assembled under the editorship of &quot;Joe Bonham&quot;, a pseudonym taken from the quadriplegic hero of Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s pacifist novel &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;. This was a cover for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contributor and screenwriter Ed Naha and writer Ric Meyers. Shortly after the publishing trade press announced the coming launch of &quot;Fantastica&quot;, the launch was delayed by several months when the publishers of a &quot;Starlog&quot; competitor, &quot;Fantastic Films&quot; magazine, threatened a lawsuit because of the similarity in titles. This was eventually decided in favor of the plaintiff in court.

Brainstorming sessions resulted in the name &quot;Fangoria&quot;, over the objections of Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Martin, who was hired as editor during the delay. The first issue went to print July 31, 1979, with an August cover date.

==Publication==

===Early years===
The first issue of &quot;Fangoria&quot; was designed around the original &quot;fantasy film&quot; concept for the magazine and proved to be a notable publishing failure, as were the next five issues, all of which continued with the same approach. By the time issue four was released and issue six was in preparation, the publisher confided to Martin that the magazine was losing approximately US$20,000 per issue, an amount the small publisher could not sustain for long.

As described in one history of horror magazines, &quot;The first issue of &quot;Fangoria&quot;, published in 1979, was an abysmal failure, and subsequent issues did not fare much better. Apparently there was little or no interest in another magazine that did not deviate much from the already established &quot;Starlog/Cinefantastique&quot; structure.&quot; But because of great reader interest in &quot;a lavishly illustrated article on Tom Savini&#x27;s gruesome make-up effects for the 1978 film &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;,&quot; the magazine began focusing on &quot;readers&#x27; macabre interest in gory images of monsters and carnage.&quot; With the seventh issue, &quot;with a bold shift to fright flicks by featuring a still from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; on the cover&quot;, the magazine had become profitable. Then &quot;the 1980s gave rise to an endless offering of gory slasher films that &quot;Fangoria&quot; was more than happy to highlight, turning Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees into unlikely lucrative newsstand idols.&quot;
Martin continued as editor into the mid-1980s, with co-editor David Everitt from 1981 to 1985. After Everitt left, he was replaced by &quot;Starlog&quot; editor David McDonnell, who handled both magazines, with Tony Timpone under him as managing editor on &quot;Fangoria&quot;. In 1986, Timpone became editor-in-chief:

===1980s and 1990s===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;Fangoria&quot; tested numerous international horror markets, releasing issues of the magazine modified for various foreign languages. These foreign editions (released in Italy, Japan, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere) lasted only a handful of editions before being discontinued. Additionally, in May 1988, a sister publication titled &quot;Gorezone&quot; was first published. A second sister publication, titled &quot;Toxic Horror&quot; followed in 1989. &quot;Gorezone&quot; was cancelled after twenty-seven issues and one special &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;-themed issue. &quot;Toxic Horror&quot; was cancelled after five issues.

In 1990, Timpone brought in managing editor Michael Gingold, having been previously introduced to his horror-themed fanzine, &quot;Scareaphenalia&quot;. In addition to his editorial duties at the magazine, Gingold posted the majority of the news updates on the magazine&#x27;s official website. Under Gingold and Timpone&#x27;s tenure, Fangoria rose to its greatest level of prominence, enjoying widespread recognition and influence in the horror community.

===2000s===
Creative Group purchased &quot;Fangoria&quot; (and its parent publication &quot;Starlog&quot;) in the early 2000s, hoping to expand the brand identity of the magazine to radio, television, and comics. On December 5, 2007, a warehouse operated by Kable News, in Oregon, Illinois, which contained all back issues of &quot;Fangoria&quot; and &quot;Starlog&quot; magazines, was destroyed by fire. As back issues of &quot;Fangoria&quot; are not re-printed, the only remaining back issues are now housed in private collections or those available on the secondary market. After several failed ventures, Creative Group filed for Chapter 11 on March 21, 2008. In summer 2008, The Brooklyn Company, Inc., led by longtime Fangoria president Thomas DeFeo, bought &quot;Fangoria&quot; and all its related brands. Under DeFeo&#x27;s ownership, the magazine overhauled the magazine&#x27;s cover format, including the transformation of the company&#x27;s long-standing logo. Starting with issue #281, the original &quot;Fangoria&quot; logo was re-designed, and the trademark &quot;film strip&quot;, tagline, and embedded photos were removed. After consistent fan protest of the changes, the original logo returned with issue #305. The &quot;film strip&quot; photos returned briefly beginning with issue #309.

In February 2010, Chris Alexander, a Toronto-based filmmaker and former writer for &quot;Rue Morgue&quot;, succeeded Tony Timpone as &quot;Fangoria&quot;&#x27;s new editor. Under his management, the magazine explored more esoteric genre content, had its cover layout altered a few times, and hired several new staff members. Alexander also brought back the original Fangoria logo. In 2011, &quot;Gorezone&quot; was revived with a special &quot;The Bloody Best of Gorezone&quot; issue before resuming regular publication with issue #28 in 2013. In 2012, &quot;Fangoria&quot; also began publishing a line of limited edition specials titled &quot;Fangoria Legends&quot;.

===2015 print cessation===
In late September 2015, Alexander stepped down as editor-in-chief and left the &quot;Fangoria&quot; staff. By October, Gingold, who was then serving as managing editor, was hired as the publication&#x27;s new editor-in-chief. Eight months later, Gingold was fired after twenty-eight years with the magazine and the former managing editor, Ken Hanley, was named the new editor-in-chief. Many within the horror community responded with shock at Gingold&#x27;s termination and took it as a sign that the magazine had both lost touch with its fanbase and passed its glory days; Guillermo del Toro took to social media to voice his disappointment with the decision.

On February 11, 2017, Hanley announced that he too was no longer involved with the magazine and that he had been on hiatus from the company since mid-December 2016. He also stated that he felt that if the magazine remained under its current ownership, there would likely never be another new issue, especially as a print edition.

The last print edition of the magazine, issue #344, was released October 2015. After that issue, four additional issues were published exclusively in a digital format, leaving subscribers of the hard copy editions, as well as Gorezone subscribers, without the issues they paid for. Additionally, contributors such as Josh Hadley have stated that they remain unpaid for published articles and artwork. Fangoria responded to the statements made by Hanley and Hadley on February 13, in which president and owner Tom DeFeo thanked readers and subscribers for their patience and noted his intention to make amends with writers, artists, and subscribers that had been inconvenienced. The statement also noted that lack of sufficient ad revenue had been the reason for the disappearance of print editions but that DeFeo and his staff would continue their attempts to bring print editions back.

===Cinestate acquisition and return to print===

In February 2018, it was announced that Fangoria had been purchased by film producer Dallas Sonnier through his Texas-based entertainment company Cinestate. Sonnier named Phil Nobile Jr., of the &quot;Birth.Movies.Death.&quot; website as its new editor-in-chief. The company further announced that they would bring back the magazine as a quarterly, exclusively print-based publication, and offer a one-year free subscription to anyone who never received the issues to which they were entitled under the old ownership.

In addition to Gingold and Timpone returning as regular columnists, Cinestate further announced that the new writing staff would be composed of S. Craig Zahler, Grady Hendrix, Shudder curator Sam Zimmerman, Birth.Movies.Death&#x27;s Meredith Borders, author and former &quot;Rue Morgue&quot; magazine writer Preston Fassel, horror historian Rebekah McKendry, and black feminist critic Ashlee Blackwell. Cinestate planned on branching the franchise into producing films, podcasts and novels.

On May 19, 2018, the magazine announced its first licensed novel, Preston Fassel&#x27;s &quot;Our Lady of the Inferno&quot;, under their new &quot;Fangoria Presents&quot; label. The book was released September 11, 2018, to generally positive reviews, ultimately being named one of the ten best horror novels of 2018 by Bloody Disgusting. A week later, on September 18, Fangoria released their second licensed novel, Michael J. Seidlinger&#x27;s &quot;My Pet Serial Killer&quot;.

In October 2018, Cinestate published their first issue of the magazine, stylized as &quot;Volume 2, Issue 1,&quot; featuring a cover story on the 2018 film &quot;Halloween&quot;.

===Cinestate controversy and new ownership===

In June 2020, The Daily Beast published an exposé about producer Adam Donaghey&#x27;s sexual misconduct on the set of a Cinestate film.

In August 2020, Fangoria was acquired by Wanderwall Entertainment CEO Tara Ansley and entrepreneur Abhi Goel, and quarterly printing continued under their ownership. The new owners plan to launch a multimedia studio and produce and distribute fiction and non-fiction content.

==Other ventures==
Starting in 1985, Fangoria branched out into other media outlets including television, films, radio, and comic books.

Beginning in 1985, &quot;Fangoria&quot; has sponsored annual horror movie conventions known as the Weekend of Horrors in Los Angeles, New Jersey, and Chicago (with Austin, Texas, added in 2008). These conventions were produced in association with Creation Entertainment. After breaking ties with Creation in 2009, Fangoria began their own conventions, titling them the &quot;Trinity of Terrors&quot;.
In 1990, Fangoria Films was created with the goal of financing one feature film a year under this banner. The first film was 1990&#x27;s &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, starring Bruce Campbell. They created &quot;Children of the Night&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Severed Ties&quot; in 1992, then ceased production. In 1996, Fangoria Films re-emerged as a distribution company, occasionally using their &quot;Gore Zone&quot; label, to release twenty low-budget horror features over the next ten years. In 2004–2005, Fangoria Films produced and distributed &quot;Fangoria&#x27;s Blood Drive&quot;, two DVD compilations of award-winning short horror films. The first volume was hosted by musician-turned-filmmaker Rob Zombie, and the second by MuchMusic&#x27;s (now called FUSE) Mistress Juliya.

In 1991, &quot;Fangoria&quot; began honoring horror cinema with their annual Chainsaw Awards, which were voted on by readers of their magazine. The winners were announced at an awards show in Los Angeles, California, which was produced by Fangoria&#x27;s managing editor, Michael Gingold. In association with FUSE TV, &quot;Fangoria&quot; first televised its Chainsaw Awards in 2006. The event occurred on October 15, and was aired on FUSE on October 22. The event was not renewed for 2007, although the awards continued in the magazine.

From 1999 to 2003, they partnered with Bedford Entertainment to attain wider releases of certain &quot;Fangoria&quot; titles. Movies released during this time included &quot;I, Zombie: A Chronicle of Pain&quot;, &quot;The Last Horror Movie&quot;, &quot;Slashers&quot;, and &quot;Dead Meat&quot;. Many of these films featured the &quot;Fangoria&quot; logo along the top of their video/DVD covers, while &quot;Fangoria&quot;&#x27;s involvement in other releases was substantially more subdued.
From 2006 to 2009, Fangoria worked with Creative Group after it had purchased Fangoria in the early 2000s. &quot;Fangoria Entertainment&quot; was created as a result. This allowed both parties to agitate the &quot;Fangoria&quot; brand identity to a number of other media outlets in 2006. Creative Group also added a new &quot;Vampire Skull&quot; logo to Fangoria&#x27;s properties, which was used extensively after its inception. In 2010, all of Creative Group&#x27;s Fangoria brands were discontinued.

From 2006 to 2007 there was &quot;Fangoria TV&quot;. Originally conceived as a network television station dedicated to horror films, it was eventually modified to fit a limited online format.

From 2006 to 2009 there was Fangoria Radio. Debuting on Friday, June 23, 2006, it was a horror-themed talk radio program which aired on Sirius Radio Channel 108 and XM Radio Channel 139 on Friday nights. It was hosted by Dee Snider and Debbie Rochon, and regularly featured then-editor Tony Timpone.

In June 2007, Fangoria Comics was launched. For various reasons, the line abruptly ended a month later in August. Only two series were published: the two-issue series &quot;Fourth Horsemen&quot;, and the four-issue series &quot;Bump&quot;.

In 2018, under Cinestate, Fangoria&#x27;s podcast network included the shows &quot;Shockwaves&quot;, &quot;Nightmare on Film Street&quot;, &quot;Post Mortem with Mick Garris,&quot; &quot;Casualty Friday&quot;, &quot;The Movie Crypt&quot;, and &quot;Nightmare University&quot;. Concurrently, Fangoria founded a literary imprint called FANGORIA Presents that published four novels between 2018-2020, including works by Mick Garris and Max Booth III; two additional experimental horror novels, Robert Ashcroft&#x27;s &quot;The Megarothke&quot; and Jess Hagemann&#x27;s &quot;Headcheese&quot; were published under a sister imprint but promoted through Fangoria. The podcast network disbanded and the imprints were shut down following the 2020 controversy. In 2022, Mark Alan Miller acquired the publishing rights to five of the six books to be reprinted in new editions through his company Encyclopocalypse Publications.

In 2011 &quot;Fangoria&quot; partnered with producer Carl Amari to create &quot;Fangoria&#x27;s Dreadtime Stories&quot;, a horror radio drama series hosted by Malcolm McDowell and featuring original music by &quot;Fangoria&quot; editor-in-chief Chris Alexander.

In late 2020, &quot;Fangoria&quot; debuted the shows &quot;Colors of the Dark&quot; and &quot;The KingCast&quot; on their podcast network.

At one point, said longtime editor Tony Timpone, &quot;Fangoria&quot; &quot;almost did a &#x27;Fango Junior&#x27;, for the young adult/Goosebumps set.&quot;

==Fangoria.com==
Until 2016, the &quot;Fangoria&quot; online site featured daily updates about the world of horror, allowing the &quot;Fangoria&quot; brand to remain relevant to those who do not typically read print magazines. The website also featured several specialized horror blogs, including articles that continued &quot;Fangoria&quot;&#x27;s long tradition of being supportive of LGBT people working in the horror industry.

Following Cinestate&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;Fangoria&quot;, the homepage briefly went offline, replaced eventually by a front page of aggregated news. This version of the site was discontinued once Cinestate sold the brand to Fangoria Publishing, LLC. Fangoria.com returned in 2021.

==Fangoria Chainsaw Awards==
The Fangoria Chainsaw Awards are an award ceremony for horror films and thriller films. Beginning in 1992, the awards were expanded and an annual ceremony was inaugurated to give out the awards.

<doc id="960559" wikidata="Q408598" url="?curid=960559" title="Stromal cell-derived factor 1">
<text>The stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), also known as C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), is a chemokine protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;CXCL12&quot; gene on chromosome 10. It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. Stromal cell-derived factors 1-alpha and 1-beta are small cytokines that belong to the chemokine family, members of which activate leukocytes and are often induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide, TNF, or IL1. The chemokines are characterized by the presence of 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 disulfide bonds. They can be classified into 2 subfamilies. In the CC subfamily, the cysteine residues are adjacent to each other. In the CXC subfamily, they are separated by an intervening amino acid. The SDF1 proteins belong to the latter group. CXCL12 signaling has been observed in several cancers. The &quot;CXCL12&quot; gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.

== Structure ==
=== Gene ===

The &quot;CXCL12&quot; gene resides on chromosome 10 at the band 10q11.21 and contains 4 exons.. This gene produces 7 isoforms through alternative splicing.

=== Protein ===
This protein belongs to the intercrine alpha (chemokine CXC) family. SDF-1 is produced in two forms, SDF-1α/CXCL12a and SDF-1β/CXCL12b, by alternate splicing of the same gene. Chemokines are characterized by the presence of four conserved cysteines, which form two disulfide bonds. The CXCL12 proteins belong to the group of CXC chemokines, whose initial pair of cysteines are separated by one intervening amino acid. In addition, the first 8 residues of the CXCL12 N-terminal serve as a receptor binding site, though only Lys-1 and Pro-2 directly participated in activating the receptor. Meanwhile, the RFFESH motif (residues 12-17) in the loop region function as a docking site for CXCL12 receptor binding.

== Function ==
CXCL12 is expressed in many tissues in mice including brain, thymus, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, platelets and bone marrow. CXCL12 is strongly chemotactic for lymphocytes. During embryogenesis, it directs the migration of hematopoietic cells from fetal liver to bone marrow and the formation of large blood vessels. It has also been shown that CXCL12 signalling regulates the expression of CD20 on B cells. CXCL12 is also chemotactic for mesenchymal stem cells and is expressed in the area of inflammatory bone destruction, where it mediates their suppressive effect on osteoclastogenesis.

In adulthood, CXCL12 plays an important role in angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow through a CXCR4 dependent mechanism.

CXCR4, previously called LESTR or fusin, is the receptor for CXCL12. This CXCL12-CXCR4 interaction used to be considered exclusive (unlike for other chemokines and their receptors), but recently, it was suggested that CXCL12 may also bind the CXCR7 receptor (now called ACKR3). By blocking CXCR4, a major coreceptor for HIV-1 entry, CXCL12 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strains.

=== CNS ===
During embryonic development, CXCL12 plays a role in cerebellar formation through the migration of neurons. Within the CNS, CXCL12 contributes to cell proliferation, neurogenesis (nervous tissue development and growth), as well as neuroinflammation. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are stem cells that differentiate into glial and neuronal cells. CXCL12 promotes their migration to lesion sites within the brain, specifically over extensive ranges. Once at the site of damage, NPCs may begin stem cell based tissue repair to the lesion. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis provides guidance cues for axons and neurites hence promoting neurite outgrowth (neurons forming projections) and neurogenesis. Like other chemokines, CXCL12 is involved with cell migration that contributes to inflammation. In regards to the CNS, CXCL12 plays a role in neuroinflammation by attracting leukocytes across the blood brain barrier. however, excessive production and accumulation of CXCL12 can become toxic and the inflammation produced may result in serious consequences.

== Clinical significance ==
In humans, CXCL12 has been implicated in a wide variety of biomedical conditions involving several organ systems. Furthermore, CXCL12 signaling in conjunction with CXCR7 signaling has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic cancer. In the urinary tract system, methylation of the CXCL12 promoter and expression of PD-L1 may be powerful prognostic biomarkers for biochemical recurrence in prostate carcinoma patients after radical prostatectomy, and further studies are ongoing to confirm if CXCL12 methylation may aid in active surveillance strategies. In the field of oncology, melanoma associated fibroblasts are stimulated by stimulation of the A2B adenosine receptor followed by stimulation of fibroblast growth factor and increased expression of CXCL12.

=== Clinical marker ===
A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the CXCL12 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

=== Multiple Sclerosis ===
A neurological condition that results from a faulty interaction between the immune and nervous systems in multiple sclerosis. MS is characterized by demyelination of nerves due to the body&#x27;s immune system attacking the CNS. Elevated levels of CXCL12 are observed in the cerebral spinal fluid of patients with MS. CXCL12 crosses the blood–brain barrier and causes neuroinflammation that contributes to axonal damage and therefore the progression of multiple sclerosis.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Though CXCL12 may be detrimental for those with MS, recent research is suggesting that this chemokine may be beneficial in decreasing the progression of patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s. Alzheimer&#x27;s is another neurological condition and the most common form of dementia where cognition significantly declines. One main characteristic of Alzheimer&#x27;s is the accumulation of a brain plaque known as beta-amyloid. There are neuroprotective aspects of CXCL12 in mice with these plaques/Alzheimer&#x27;s. PAK is a protein associated with maintaining dendritic spines, which are essential at synapses in receiving information from axons. Mislocalization of PAK occurs in patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s, however pretreatment of neurons in mice with CXCL12 showed a suppression of that mislocalization. Additionally, this pretreatment with CXCL decreased the prevalence of apoptosis and oxidative damage normally caused by the presence of the beta-amyloid plaque.

===As a drug target===
Chemokines and chemokine receptors, of which CXCR stands out, regulate multiple processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and immune responses and are considered potential targets for drug development. It is indicated by clinical samples that a high expression level of CXCR4 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs. Experimental evidence further indicate that CXCR4/CXCR12 is associated with the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. In the gastrointestinal tract system, the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis is under investigation as an anti-fibrotic therapy in the treatment for chronic pancreatitis. For instance, blocking CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, with Plerixafor (AMD-3100) increased the effectiveness of combretastatin in a mouse model of breast cancer, presumably by preventing macrophages from being recruited to tumours.[15][16] AMD-3100 is also widely used in combination with G-CSF for mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells into the blood stream, allowing collection for bone marrow transplant.

<text>Stock Ticker is a stock holding board game that was first released in 1937 by Copp-Clark Publishing.

==Game play==
The game has six stocks, which in fact are commodities. These six are gold, silver, Bonds, oil, industrials, and grain. During gameplay all the stocks are identical. Each stock begins costing a dollar apiece. Players are given starting money of $5000 and they buy shares in groups of 500, 1000, 2000, or 5000. The stocks move based on the throw of three dice. The first die picks the stock that will be affected, with one of the commodities on each side of the die. The second die determines whether the stock will move up, down, or pay a dividend. The third die decides if the movement or dividend will be five, ten, or twenty cents. For instance, a roll of Industrials, Down, 20 will move the industrials stock from its start value of $1.00 to 80 cents. A roll of Grain, Up, 5 would move grain up to $1.05.

Dividends are paid out only for any stocks that are at or above $1.00 in value. For instance, a five-cent dividend pays five cents for each share owned. Thus, if a roll is Oil, Dividend, 10, and you own a thousand shares of Oil at $1.25 apiece you will receive a dividend of $100. Note that the dividend is not affected by the value of the share, with only the rule being that stocks worth less than $1.00 do not pay out when a dividend is rolled for them.

If a stock ever reaches $2.00 it splits. Everyone who owns the stock doubles the number of shares owned and the stock goes back to being worth $1.00. If a stock falls to being worth nothing all players lose their investment in that stock and must return their shares to the bank. The stock is then reset at $1.00.

After a set number of rolls, all players are able to buy and sell stocks concurrently at the prices established.

==Strategy==

There are two basic strategies to making money at the game. The first is to buy whichever stocks are safely in dividend-paying territory. Using this method, if a stock splits and returns to the $1.00 value, the owner should sell out and reinvest in a stock that is safely above par. Similarly, if a stock drops below a dollar, the owner should sell the shares. This technique relies upon the rule that any money invested in a stock paying dividends will earn a greater return than shares that are not paying dividends.

The second strategy is more risky, but can also be immensely profitable. It involves buying stocks when they are near the bottom of the board and at risk of being worth nothing. Since the dice-rolling system moves stocks by a fixed amount, rather than a percentage of their value, these stocks are very volatile. One thousand dollars will buy ten thousand shares of a ten-cent stock. While this stock could move down by ten or twenty and be wiped out, the most one would lose is a thousand dollars. However, there is an equal chance that the stock will move up, and a single roll of Up 20 will triple the original investment. The possible return on investing in a five-cent stock, the cheapest possible, is even higher.

<text>Anthocharis sara, the Sara orangetip, is one of three species in the Sara orangetip complex. It has a population extending from Baja California into extreme southwest Oregon and another extending from the east slope of the Sierra Nevada into far western Nevada. The common name Pacific orangetip is obsolete since it implies a distribution that includes two separate species.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Anthocharis sara&quot; is part of the &quot;Anthocharis sara&quot; complex, along with the southwestern orangetip (&quot;Anthocharis thoosa&quot;) and Julia orangetip (&quot;Anthocharis julia&quot;).

&quot;A. sara&quot; contains four recognized subspecies:

* &quot;A. s. gunderi&quot; (Ingham, 1933), the Santa Catalina Island orangetip: Santa Catalina and Santa Cruz islands
* &quot;A. s. pseudothoosa&quot; (Austin, 1998): east slope of the Sierra Nevada and adjacent regions
* &quot;A. s. sara&quot; (Lucas, 1852): widespread west of the Sierra Nevada from the west coast of central Baja California north to southwestern Oregon
* &quot;A. s. sempervirens&quot; (Emmel, Emmel &amp; Mattoon, 2008): Redwood National Park

== Life history ==
Like many butterfly species, they have strongly seasonal life cycles. &quot;A. sara&quot; have two consecutive flights at one point in the year and are not present for the other half of the year. The first brood lives from late January to April and the second brood lives from May to early July. There has been known to occasionally be some overlap between the two generations. In captivity, the pupae of &quot;A. sara&quot; have been observed staying in diapause for up to three years. The species is found in a variety of habitats including orchards, fields, meadows, and canyons.

== Description ==
The adult female orange-tip has orange tips at the ends of its wings while the male has ultraviolet reflective tips that appear orange to human eyes but appear &quot;bee purple&quot; to the butterfly. Females lay creamy white eggs that turn orange-red a few hours after they are laid. Fifth instar &quot;A. sara&quot; larvae are a dark green color and have small black pinacula. The larvae are a plain green, and when they mature they form a light brown, thorn-shaped pupa.

== Reproductive behavior ==
During the mating season, the males patrol, flying up and down a linear path as a way to increase the likelihood of sexual encounters with females. Males usually patrol by the sides of streams and roads in the canyon bottoms. There seems to be a hierarchy between the males in which the best sites are taken by the dominant males.

== Host plants ==
&quot;A. sara&quot; commonly lay their eggs on plants in the mustard family (Cruciferae) such as &quot;Arabis perennans, Athysanus pusillus&quot;, and &quot;Brassica nigra&quot;. &quot;A. sara&quot; lay their eggs on the stems, pedicels, and the bases of petioles of these plants, and less commonly they have been known to lay their eggs on the buds, flowers, and leaves of these plants. When the larvae emerge, they eat the buds, flowers, and fruits of the host plants.

&quot;A. sara&quot; have also been found on non-native host plants in California such as &quot;Barbarea verna, Barbarea vulagris, Brassica napus, Brassica nigra, Brassica rapa, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Hirschfeldia incana, Tropaeolum spp., Raphanus sativus,  Sinapis alba, Sinapis arvensis&quot;, and &quot;Sisymbrium officinale&quot; &quot;.&quot;

<doc id="960566" wikidata="Q2088225" url="?curid=960566" title="Laugh-O-Gram Studio">
<text>The Laugh-O-Gram Studio (also called Laugh-O-Gram Studios) was an animation studio located on the second floor of the McConahay Building at 1127 East 31st in Kansas City, Missouri, that operated from June 28, 1921, to October 16, 1923.

In the early years of animation, the studio was home to many of the pioneers of animation, brought there by Walt Disney. It was the site of inspiration for Disney and Ub Iwerks to create Mickey Mouse. Laugh-O-Gram is the subject of two feature films: &quot;As Dreamers Do&quot; and &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot;.

==History==
In 1921, Walt Disney was contracted by Milton Feld to animate twelve cartoons, which he called Newman&#x27;s Laugh-O-Grams. On May 23, 1922, when Disney was 20 years old, Laugh-O-Gram Films (LOGF) was incorporated by him using the remaining assets of the defunct Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists from local investors. LOGF produced nine of the requested 12 films with little income. Encouraged and inspired by his shorts&#x27; popularity at the theatre, Disney decided he wanted to make his own animated versions of fairy tales too, and invested six months on his first attempt at &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.

Among Disney&#x27;s employees on the series were several pioneers of animation: Ub Iwerks, Hugh Harman, Friz Freleng, and Carman Maxwell. The company had financial problems and by the end of 1922, Disney was living in the office and taking baths once a week at Union Station.

During the studio&#x27;s sales manager Leslie Mace&#x27;s stay in New York, where he was looking for distributors, he ended up signing a contract for six animated shorts with Pictorial Clubs, Inc. of Tennessee on Sunday, September 16, 1922. Pictorial agreed to pay for the cartoons, which were supposed to be shown at schools and other non-theatrical places, but only paid $100 in advance. The rest of the payment would have to wait until January 1, 1924, when all the shorts had been delivered. When Pictorial went bankrupt only a few months later, the studio never received the rest of the payment, its financial problems became even more serious, and the staff ended up leaving. When the local Kansas City dentist Thomas B. McCrum, from the Deener Dental Institute, contacted Disney and offered him the job of producing a short subject about dental hygiene intended for the Missouri school system, he brought together some of his staff again and made &quot;Tommy Tucker&#x27;s Tooth&quot;, which earned the studio $500. Instead of paying off his creditors, the money was invested in the live-action/animation demonstration film &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, starring the youthful Virginia Davis. Disney had noted how popular the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; series from the Fleischer Studios was, which had animated characters interacting with the real world. By reversing this gimmick and using a real-life character in a cartoon universe instead, he hoped for a hit.
Virginia Davis&#x27;s contract with Laugh-O-Gram was signed by her parents on April 23, 1923, with terms giving her 5% of the &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; film&#x27;s receipts. Looking for a distributor for &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; on May 14, Disney wrote to Margaret Winkler, a New York film distributor.

After finishing the raw edits of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, the studio filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1923. Disney finally made some money by shooting a film of a 6-month-old girl named Kathalee Viley and selling his movie camera, earning enough for a one-way train ticket, moving to Hollywood, California; he brought along an unfinished reel of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;.

The bankruptcy trustee was able to force LOGF&#x27;s erstwhile distributor and debtor, Pictorial Films, Inc., to pay LOGF&#x27;s agents the sum owed while agreeing that Pictorial could exercise its contractual distribution rights for LOGF works and to purchase several of LOGF&#x27;s films: &quot;The Four Musicians of Bremen&quot;, &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, the &quot;Lafflets&quot; series, and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;.

The studio building fell to ruin and efforts were made to restore it by a non-profit group called &quot;Thank You, Walt Disney&quot;. The Disney family promised $450,000 in matching funds for the rights to other Disney memorabilia and to tell the history of Walt Disney&#x27;s life in Kansas City, a movie house to exhibit original and restored Laugh-O-Grams, and an education center for animation workshops.

On July 30, 2021, a black Dodge Charger struck the building and caused significant damage to the exterior. The incident occurred early in the morning, the driver fleeing the scene, though authorities subsequently found a woman&#x27;s driving license and a margarita within the vehicle. Butch Rigby, who launched the campaign to save and restore the building, described the incident optimistically: &quot;The bottom line, it&#x27;s a bump in the road, but it could have been worse&quot;.

==Inspiration for Mickey Mouse==

Disney told interviewers that the inspiration to draw Mickey came from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.

In 1928 during a train trip to New York, he showed the drawing to his wife Lillian Marie Bounds and said he was going to call it &quot;Mortimer Mouse&quot;. She replied that the name sounded &quot;too pompous&quot; and suggested Mickey Mouse instead.

Of the original seven Laugh-O-Grams fairy tales, four were long known to have survived, and have been restored for DVD: &quot;Newman Laugh-O-Grams&quot; (1921), &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; (1922), &quot;The Four Musicians of Bremen&quot; (1922), &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (1922), and &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1922). These shorts later became available on Blu-ray Disc as bonus features for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. &quot;Tommy Tucker&#x27;s Tooth&quot; (1922) and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; (1923) are also available on DVD, and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; eventually became a bonus feature for the &quot;60th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition&quot; of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. The original piece of filming and animation known as &quot;Newman Laugh-O-Grams&quot; (originally released theatrically on March 20, 1921) is available on some DVDs too. In accordance with United States copyright law, all 11 shorts produced by the studio have entered into the public domain as of 2019.

The missing fairy tale cartoons were &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, and &quot;Goldie Locks and the Three Bears&quot; (all 1922). In October 2010, copies of all three cartoons had been found according to animation historian David Gerstein. For many years the two &quot;Jack&quot; cartoons were believed to be one, until researcher John Kenworthy located old studio assets sheets confirming that they were separate shorts.

<doc id="960568" wikidata="Q782454" url="?curid=960568" title="Superstition (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)">
<text>Superstition is the tenth studio album by English rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees, released on 10 June 1991 by Polydor Records. The lead single, &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;, gave the band their first top 40 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 entry in the United States, peaking at No. 23, with the album peaking at No. 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The band widened their musical influences with the arrival of musician Talvin Singh, who played tablas on the songs &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; and &quot;Silver Waterfalls&quot;.

==Background and promotion==
The band wrote the songs in a residential studio in Wales. The album was then recorded with producer Stephen Hague in London at RAK Studios. Hague used techniques that Siouxsie Sioux did not approve of later, such as computer-based production. She stated: &quot;There are still songs I like on it, like &#x27;Kiss Them for Me&#x27; and &#x27;Drifter&#x27;, but we were trying a different kind of working style, a different kind of discipline, during which I really built a strong case against computers.&quot; Steven Severin had a different perspective as he liked Hague&#x27;s way of working, which was &quot;all about honing and honing until you have something great&quot;.

In 1991, the band spent two months on the road, from July until August, in the United States as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour. The last date took place in Seattle on 31 August. Two weeks later, the album reached its highest position at number 65 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the week of 14 September; it spent 21 weeks total on that chart. It remained their best selling album in the US, with 358,000 sold copies as of 2004, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Release==
&quot;Superstition&quot; was reissued in a remastered CD version with bonus tracks in October 2014. A 180 gram double-vinyl reissue of the original edition, with the fourth side etched, was half-speed mastered by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios and released in September 2018.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Q&quot; rated the album four out of five stars, saying: &quot;They pop it up with sweet string textures on the single &#x27;Kiss Them for Me&#x27;, bear down on the maritime metaphor of &#x27;Drifter&#x27; with doomy foghorn and bells effects, give it the all but &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; dreamscape for &#x27;Softly&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; as &quot;gorgeous, wicked and glamorous.&quot; In the same paper, reviewer Jon Wilde described &quot;Superstition&quot; as &quot;a giant record about obsession, phobia, perspective and emotional tyranny.&quot; Wilde said that the song &quot;The Ghost in You&quot; was &quot;a furiously pretty six note refrain that haunts long after the needle has returned to safety.&quot; In a four out of five review, &quot;Select&quot; said that &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; was a &quot;passionately laidback&quot; single, &quot;exotic&quot; and &quot;funky&quot;, with &quot;an underlying hush of electro pulsebeat&quot; making it dancefloor friendly. In the same review, &quot;Drifter&quot; was compared to the soundtrack of a Sergio Leone film with a touch of &quot;ethereal sensuality&quot;, and &quot;Silver Waterfalls&quot; was qualified as &quot;gorgeous&quot;. The reviewer commented that the album ends with the &quot;delicate&quot; &quot;Softly&quot;, with lyrics bare and tender enough to be almost like Scott Walker. Glyn Brown concluded: [It is] &quot;ambitious&quot;.

Writing in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Mark Coleman and Mac Randall said that &quot;Superstition&quot; shares &quot;Peepshow&quot;″s integration of &quot;synthesizers and a lighter pop touch with the Banshees&#x27; trademark howl.&quot; Unlike its predecessor, however, they added that the album benefits from the inclusion of a &quot;great single&quot;, as &quot;&#x27;Kiss Them for Me&#x27; weaves a bewitching electronic stitch through Siouxsie&#x27;s familiar cloth.&quot;

==Legacy==
St. Vincent selected &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; in the episode 32 of her own radio show &quot;Mixtape Delivery Service&quot;, on Beats 1 Radio Apple Music. Karin Dreijer of the Knife included and presented &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; in a 60-minute program they produced for Sveriges Radio in 2004. Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio was inspired by the song &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;. Sitek stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve always tried to make a song that begins like &#x27;Kiss Them for Me&#x27;. I think songs like &#x27;I Was a Lover&#x27; or &#x27;Wash the Day Away&#x27; came from that element of surprise mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you&#x27;re like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends&#x27;re going to fall for this. I feel like that transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids and that was the first example where I thought, we&#x27;ve got them, they&#x27;re hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy.&quot; Girlpool included &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; in a playlist they did for &quot;The Fader&quot; magazine titled &quot;Fantasie&quot;, among songs that &quot;transcend time&quot;.

<text>Bokak Atoll (Marshallese: &#x27; or &#x27;, ) or Taongi Atoll is an uninhabited coral atoll in the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands, in the North Pacific Ocean. Due to its relative isolation from the main islands in the group, Bokak&#x27;s flora and fauna has been able to exist in a pristine condition.

== Geography ==
It is located north of Majuro Atoll, the capital of the Marshall Islands, and north-northwest of Bikar Atoll, the closest atoll, making it the most northerly and most isolated atoll of the country. Wake Island is north-northwest. The land area is , and the lagoon measures . It consists of 36 islets. The total area is (including reef flat).

== Physical features ==

The atoll is roughly crescent-shaped, measuring about by , and oriented in a north–south direction. The atoll reef is unbroken except for a wide channel in the west. Ten islets lie on the eastern and southeastern reef. The more important named islets, from north to south, are North Island, Kamwome, Bwdije, Sibylla, Bokak, and Bwokwla. Sibylla is the largest, measuring approximately in length and up to in width. Kamwome Islet to the north-east of Sibylla is the second largest, while Bokak (Taongi), after which the atoll is named, lies to the south of Sibylla.

Based on the results of drilling operations on Enewetak (Eniwetok) Atoll, in the nearby Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands, Bokak may include as much as of reef material atop a basalt rock base. As most local coral growth stops at about below the ocean surface, such a massive stony coral base suggests a gradual isostatic subsidence of the underlying extinct volcano, which itself rises from the surrounding ocean floor. Shallow water fossils taken from just above Enewetak&#x27;s basalt base are dated to about 55mya.

High boulder and sand ridges indicate a history of severe storms and are a feature of the islets. Inland on the wider islets are sand and rubble flats, while back from the lagoon sides are low sand and gravel ridges. Soils are mostly very immature, a mixture of coarser coral sand and gravel of various textures with very little humus accumulation. The lagoon is shallow, probably not exceeding depth, and has many coral heads and patch reefs, some reaching the surface.

The lagoon water level is up to higher than the surrounding ocean due to an influx of wind-driven waters over the windward ocean reef and the presence of only one narrow reef passage on the leeward side. Water cascades over the coral-covered rim and flats of the sloping leeward reef. A massive algal ridge lines the outer edge of the windward reef, while the south and west reefs are coral-covered narrow flats where landings can be made in quiet weather. A very small algal rim, high, on lagoon shores of the westernmost islets, on east-facing lagoon reef-fronts and on the windward edges of coral patches in the lagoon, may be a feature unique to Taongi. This rim is maintained by the constant flow of water over the reef flat.

== Climate ==
Bokak is the driest of the Marshall Islands atolls, having a semi-arid character. Mean annual temperature is approximately . Mean annual rainfall is less than , and falls primarily during the late summer. Prevailing winds are north to north-easterlies.

== Vegetation ==
Bokak supports just nine plant species. All are native to the Marshall Islands and entirely undisturbed by introduced species. A combination of insufficient rainfall, excellent drainage, and high temperatures lead to an arid environment in which a freshwater Ghyben-Herzberg lens cannot form, and coconut palm is unable to grow. The most common formation is a low, sparse scrub forest of tree heliotrope (&quot;Heliotropium foertherianum&quot;), tall, with occasional taller trees. The understory typically comprises beach maupaka (&quot;Scaevola taccada&quot;), or sparse endemic bunchgrass, ihi (&quot;Portulaca molokiniensis&quot;), ilima (&quot;Sida fallax&quot;), or alena (&quot;Boerhavia herbstii&quot;), the latter being more abundant on broken coral gravel. A small stand of &quot;Pisonia grandis&quot; is found on Kamwome Islet and in another very small stand on Sibylla.

Pure stands of very dense beach naupaka shrubland, sometimes with tree heliotrope, are predominant and cover 50-75% of southern, and nearly 100% of northeastern Sibylla. &quot;Heliotropium&quot;, &quot;Scaevola&quot;, and &quot;Sida&quot; dominated shrublands and the sandy bunchgrass savanna (&quot;Lepturus&quot; spp.) represent the finest examples of such vegetation in the Marshalls and probably the entire Pacific region.

The aquatic vegetation of the shallow edges of the lagoon consists of sparse coralline algae, encrusting fragments of coral and shells, and patches of green seaweed.

== Fauna ==
The atoll supports a large population of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, golden plover, and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets to the north of Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer&#x27;s petrel.

Terrestrial species includes the Polynesian rat on Sibylla. The more aggressive black rat appears to be absent, despite wrecked fishing vessels on the eastern and north eastern reefs. The snake-eyed skink and large hermit crabs are common.

 In general, the aquatic fauna population is healthy, but of low diversity, possibly due to the atoll&#x27;s isolation. Researchers have not seen any marine turtles, but Polynesian custom regarding harvesting assumed their presence. Examples of the giant clam family Tridacnidae are very abundant, except for the largest giant clam T. gigas. Smaller bivalves were present, but few Mollusks. The reef fish are primarily emperor breams, parrotfish, and red snappers. Also present are moray eel and grey reef shark. Approximately 100 stony coral species and two soft coral species are present.

== History ==

===Prehistory===
Although humans migrated to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago, there appear to be no traditional Marshallese artifacts present that would indicate any long term settlement. The harsh, desiccated climate, lack of potable water, and poverty of the soils indicate that the atoll will probably remain uninhabited. The atoll has traditionally been used for hunting and gathering, particularly seabirds, by inhabitants of other atolls in the northern Ratak chain. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bikar and Toke, Bokak was traditionally the hereditary property of the Iroji Lablab (chiefs) of the Ratak atoll chain. The exploitation of abundant sea turtles, birds, and eggs was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.

===16th to 19th Century===
The first European to record sighting Bokak was Toribio Alonso de Salazar, a Spanish explorer, on August 22, 1526, who commanded Loaisa expedition after the death of Loaisa and Elcano. It was charted as &quot;San Bartolome&quot;. It was explored by Spanish naval officer Fernando Quintano in 1795. A number of other Western ships recorded landfall on or passage by Bokak over the following three hundred years, but no attempt at settlement or establishment of food animals was noted, likely due to the arid conditions, and more fertile atolls nearby.

The German Empire annexed the Marshall Islands in 1885 and added to the protectorate of German New Guinea in 1906. Using the justification that uninhabited atolls were unclaimed, the Germans seized Bokak as government property, despite the protests of the local chiefs (Irojilaplap). As Japan&#x27;s economic vigor expanded under the Meiji Emperor, the German administration noted Marshallese complaints of Japanese bird poaching, more from the view of protecting German sovereignty, rather than the interests of the islanders.

===20th century to present===
In 1914, the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands, and transferred German government properties to their own, including Bokak. Like the Germans before them, the Japanese colonial administration did not attempt to exploit the atoll, and the Northern Ratak Marshallese continued to hunt and fish unmolested.

As a part of the 1940s Japanese militarization of the Marshall Islands, a small seaplane and communication outpost was established on Sibylla Island. During the early stages of the World War II, USN submarines operating in the area would periodically note patrols by Japanese aircraft. In March, 1943, the 20 man garrison was removed to Wake Island because of the lack of food and their general inability to sustain themselves on Bokak. Air elements of the USAAF, USN, and USMC bombed the (abandoned) facility on April 23, 1944. The base became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands.

The Marshall Islands as a whole were transferred to American administration in the wake of battles with Japanese forces in 1944. In September, 1945, as a part of the post-war repatriation of Japanese from their former Pacific possessions, a landing party was dispatched on LCI(L) 601 from Kwajalein to Bokak Atoll, and in conjunction with a PBM Mariner searched for potential survivors. Two days of search failed to turn up any survivors, human remains, or graves.

While en route from the US to Asia in April, 1953, LST 1138, later commissioned as , dropped anchor at Bokak to search for rumored Japanese stragglers. The landing party noted the remains of the wartime outpost, but found no signs of any current occupants.
In 1954, the experience of large scale fallout from the Castle Bravo nuclear test on Bikini Atoll led to a pre-planned aerial survey of atolls adjacent to the subsequent Castle Romeo test, timed at one and four hours after the shot. The aircraft were equipped with gamma radiation detectors designed to measure ground contamination from altitudes of . An overflight of Sibylla Island measured 1.0 mrem/hr (10 μGy) an hour after the shot, dropping to 0.4 mrem/hr (4 μGy) three hours later. In 1957, Bokak was surveyed as a site for nuclear weapons testing as a part of Operation Hardtack, but due to the number of improvements required to develop it, was passed over in favor of reusing the Bikini, Enewetak, and Nevada test sites. The atoll came under renewed consideration for use during Operation Dominic, but by that time the potential for political fallout from nuclear testing within a United Nations Trust Territory was deemed too great.

The atoll played a part in the disappearance of several men from Maui, Hawaii. On February 11, 1979, Scott Moorman and four companions set sail from Hana harbor in a 17-foot Boston Whaler, and went missing in subsequent high seas. The boat and buried remains of Moorman were discovered away on Bokak in 1988.

In 1988, the US firm Admiralty Pacific proposed to use the Bokak lagoon as a dump for millions of tons of solid waste. The proposal involved shipping 3.5 million tons of waste the first year and up to 25 million tons and 30 ships after five years.

In August, 2003, two ham radio enthusiasts from Texas camped on Sibylla Island for 76 hours to inaugurate the first Taongi ham station, call sign V73T, and assigned the IOTA reference number OC-263. The station transmitted from coordinates .

The Dominion of Melchizedek, an unrecognized micronation, claims sovereignty over Bokak, based on a 45-year lease allegedly granted by the Irojilaplap. The rights conveyed to DOM cannot be greater than the traditional leader possessed themself. As such they are still subject to the Government of the Marshall Islands and are not independent.

Currently, historic remains include an abandoned camp/homestead, several wrecked ships and the remnant of the former World War Two Japanese communication outpost.

In 2025, the atoll was included in the Marshall Islands&#x27; first designated marine sanctuary.

<doc id="960577" wikidata="Q2629221" url="?curid=960577" title="Final Straw">
<text>Final Straw is the third studio album and major-label debut by Northern Irish–Scottish alternative rock band Snow Patrol, released on 4 August 2003 in the United Kingdom and in 2004 in the United States. The album is notable for bringing the band their first mainstream success outside of their native countries of Northern Ireland and Scotland. In the 14 months following its release, a total of 5 singles were drawn from it. It is their first album to feature lead guitarist Nathan Connolly and their last with bassist Mark McClelland.

The album was re-released in the UK in 2004 with two extra tracks, before being exported to the US (without the bonus tracks). The album was also released on SACD and DualDisc with 5.1 Surround mixes.

A 20th anniversary edition was released on 4 August 2023, 20 years after the album&#x27;s original release.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s A&amp;R representative Jim Chancellor explained the reasons for choosing rock producer Jacknife Lee to oversee the record by saying, &quot;I wanted a record for them that was bigger and bolder and a lot different than their previous records. I wanted them to make a more of a rock album than an indie record.&quot; Chancellor, Lee and the band chose fifteen songs to start working on out of an original pool of 24. Critical to the new direction was Lightbody&#x27;s development into a more rounded songwriter. &quot;They played us some songs which were not indie. There were a couple of pop songs and then &quot;Run&quot;, which is an enormous emotional rollercoaster of a track,&quot; said Chancellor.

==Recording and composition==
During the first couple of weeks in the studio the band found it quite difficult to adapt from an &#x27;indie&#x27;-oriented sound to a more commercially viable pop rock sound. Producer Lee offered constructive suggestions about how to both simplify their songs and augment them with other sounds such as strings, and Snow Patrol proved very receptive to his advice. According to Chancellor, &quot;Some bands tend to be more defensive about what goes on in the studio. Snow Patrol weren&#x27;t. They were very much like, &#x27;Yeah, we really want to be successful this time.&#x27;&quot;

The lyrics, all written by Lightbody are about failing relationships and break-ups. They were inspired by his personal experiences. Quinn, his longtime friend, says that he knows who Lightbody sings about in those songs. The lyrics deal with the themes of relationships and politics. Lightbody has said that his &quot;finally learn[ing] to write a chorus&quot; was the key to the album&#x27;s success.

Guitarist Nathan Connolly joined the band during the recording sessions. He did not contribute much, as the whole album had already been demoed. He commented that he found it easy to start writing and sharing his ideas with the rest of the band, as he had a good relationship with the band before being a member. The album&#x27;s music incorporates distorted guitar, feedback styles, and the vocals are gritty. The band&#x27;s sound on the album was described as being a &quot;cross between the sullen folk of Nick Drake and the more punchy rock moments of Simple Minds and the Pixies. Reviewing the album, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the performances as being based around &quot;rigid, unwavering tempos that approximate dance music,&quot; created through looped sections of playing augmented with electronics. The first song, &quot;How to Be Dead&quot;, introduces this sound with extensive use of drum machine programming.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Final Straw&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. According to Metacritic, the album received a weighted mean review score of 73 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Before repromotion of the album, sales reached 20,000 copies.

<text>A sheriff court () is the principal local civil and criminal court in Scotland, with exclusive jurisdiction over all civil cases with a monetary value up to , and with the jurisdiction to hear any criminal case except treason, murder, and rape, which are in the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court of Justiciary. Though the sheriff courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court over armed robbery, drug trafficking, and sexual offences involving children, the vast majority of these cases are heard by the High Court. Each court serves a sheriff court district within one of the six sheriffdoms of Scotland. Each sheriff court is presided over by a sheriff, who is a legally qualified judge, and part of the judiciary of Scotland.

Sheriff courts hear civil cases as a bench trial without a jury, and make determinations and judgments alone. However, the specialist all-Scotland Sheriff Personal Injury Court (based in Edinburgh) has the ability to hear cases with a jury of twelve. Sheriff courts hear criminal trials on complaint as a bench trial for summary offences, and as a trial with a jury of fifteen for indictable offences. Where a person is convicted following a case heard on complaint they can be sentenced to a maximum of twelve months imprisonment and/or a fine, and in solemn cases, 5 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine.

Judgments of the sheriff courts in criminal offences handled through summary procedures, and civil cases handled through small claims and summary process, can be appealed to the Sheriff Appeal Court. Criminal offences heard on indictment through solemn procedure are appealed to the High Court of Justiciary. Other civil actions are appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session.

== History ==

The office of sheriff dates from the early days of the Scottish monarchy. Generally, one of the more powerful local lords in each county was appointed and the office became hereditary in his family. The original purpose of the sheriff was to exercise and preserve the King&#x27;s authority against the rival powers of the local lords and the sheriff became the local representative of the King in all matters, judicial and administrative. The sheriff dispensed the King&#x27;s justice in his county in the Sheriff Court. The hereditary sheriff later delegated his judicial functions to a trained lawyer called a sheriff-depute. The Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746 abolished the office of hereditary sheriff and the sheriff-depute soon became sheriff principal.

At first, only the sheriff of the Lothians and Peebles (who sat at Edinburgh) and the sheriff of Lanarkshire (who sat at Glasgow) were full-time appointments. Since the part-time sheriff-depute was not compelled to reside within his sheriffdom and could carry on his practice as advocate, it became common for a depute to appoint a sheriff-substitute who acted in his absence. Over time, the judicial duties of the depute were entirely assumed by the substitute and the depute became a judge of appeal from the decisions of his substitute.

The Sheriff Court (Scotland) Act 1870 combined the thirty counties of Scotland into fifteen sheriffdoms. Until 1877, the sheriffs-substitutes were appointed by the sheriffs-deputes; after 1877, that right was reserved to the Crown.

The civil procedure before the Sheriff Court underwent a major overhaul with the enactment of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1907.

==Remit and jurisdiction==
The legal cases which are heard within the courts are dealt with by a sheriff. A sheriff is a judge who is usually assigned to work in a specific court, although some work as &quot;floating sheriffs&quot;, who may work anywhere in Scotland. There are about 140 full-time sheriffs in the various courts and a number of part-time sheriffs. They are appointed on the recommendation of the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland. Until 1999, there were also &quot;temporary sheriffs&quot; who were appointed by the executive year by year and only sat for particular days by invitation; this class of sheriff was abolished as being inconsistent with judicial independence (contrary to article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) following the decision of the High Court of Justiciary in &quot;Starrs v Ruxton&quot;.

The sheriff courts are the main criminal courts. The procedure followed may either be solemn procedure, where the Sheriff sits with a jury of fifteen; or summary procedure, where the sheriff sits alone in a bench trial. From 10 December 2007, the maximum penalty that may be imposed in summary cases is 12 months imprisonment and/or a fine, and in solemn cases 5 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine.

Since 2017, appeals against conviction and sentence from the justice of the peace and sheriff courts in summary procedure are remitted to the Sheriff Appeal Court.

The Sheriff Appeal Court can &quot;refer&quot; a point of law to the High Court of Justiciary.

==Staffing==
The Courts are staffed by civil servants who are employed by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service which is a non-ministerial government department whose corporate board is chaired by the Lord President of the Court of Session, and is independent of the Scottish Ministers. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service publishes an online map, lists of Sheriffs, and the rules of the court under different procedures.

==Sheriffdoms==
There are six sheriffdoms in Scotland, each with a sheriff principal. Within each sheriffdom are sheriff court districts, each with a court presided over by one or more sheriffs. The most senior civil servant in each Court is the sheriff clerk and he or she is charged directly with the management of the Court. The Sheriffdoms are Glasgow and Strathkelvin, Grampian, Highland and Islands, Lothian and Borders, North Strathclyde, South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway, and Tayside Central and Fife. 

As of 1 February 2015, there are 39 Sheriff Courts in Scotland. Some, in rural areas of Scotland, are small due to the sparse population. Courts such as those in the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow have a large number of staff and can in one day deal with hundreds of cases. Glasgow Sheriff Court, for example, is the busiest Court in Europe.

==Relationship to other courts==
Sheriff Courts are above local Justice of the Peace Courts who deal with very minor offences and below the Supreme Courts. The High Court of Justiciary deals with serious criminal matters, such as murder, rape and treason, and the Court of Session is Scotland&#x27;s supreme civil court.

Any final decision of a Sheriff may be appealed. On 1 January 2016 the right of appeal to the Sheriff Principal was abolished and instead an appeal lies to the newly created Sheriff Appeal Court. All Criminal decisions were formally appealed to the High Court of Justiciary, but as of 22 September 2015 appeals in summary cases and appeals against bail decisions go to the Sheriff Appeal Court with appeals from Solemn cases going to the High Court of Justiciary.

== Reform of civil procedure ==
In 2009 Lord Gill, the Lord Justice Clerk, delivered his &quot;Scottish Civil Courts Review&quot; which was heralded as the &quot;most far-reaching reform of Scotland&#x27;s civil justice system in nearly two centuries&quot;.

Among his 206 proposals were:
* a major shift of work from the Court of Session to sheriff courts,
* removal of the jurisdictional overlap between those courts,
* specialisation of sheriffs in areas such as family law, commerce, personal injury,
* new district judges to deal with less legally complicated and low-value civil actions such as small claims and housing disputes.

In November 2010 the Scottish Government released its response to the &quot;Review&quot; accepting &quot;the majority of Lord Gill&#x27;s recommendations&quot; including expressly the following proposals:
* &quot;Civil court business should be reallocated to more appropriate levels, with a far greater proportion of civil court business to be heard by the sheriff courts
* &quot;A specialised personal injury court should be established as part of Edinburgh Sheriff Court
* &quot;The creation of a new Sheriff Appeal Court
* &quot;The introduction of a new role of District Judge
* &quot;Adoption of an improved and more active approach to case management
* &quot;The introduction of designated specialist judges&quot;

In October 2011, the Scottish Government announced consultation on appointments to a new Scottish Civil Justice Council to draft rules of procedure for civil proceedings in the Court of Session and sheriff court. The establishment of the Council was one of Lord Gill&#x27;s 2009 recommendations. The new Scottish Civil Justice Council was formally established on 28 May 2013.

<doc id="960581" wikidata="Q2313934" url="?curid=960581" title="Load-bearing wall">
<text>A load-bearing wall or bearing wall is a wall that is an active structural element of a building, which holds the weight of the elements above it, by conducting its weight to a foundation structure below it. 

Load-bearing walls are one of the earliest forms of construction. The development of the flying buttress in Gothic architecture allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central bearing walls. In housing, load-bearing walls are most common in the light construction method known as &quot;platform framing&quot;. In the birth of the skyscraper era, the concurrent rise of steel as a more suitable framing system first designed by William Le Baron Jenney, and the limitations of load-bearing construction in large buildings, led to a decline in the use of load-bearing walls in large-scale commercial structures.

== Description ==
A load-bearing wall or bearing wall is a wall that is an active structural element of a that is, it bears the weight of the elements above said wall, resting upon it by conducting its weight to a foundation structure. The materials most often used to construct load-bearing walls in large buildings are concrete, block, or brick. By contrast, a curtain wall provides no significant structural support beyond what is necessary to bear its own materials or conduct such loads to a bearing wall.

== History ==
Load-bearing walls are one of the earliest forms of construction. The development of the flying buttress in Gothic architecture allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central bearing walls. The Notre Dame Cathedral is an example of a load-bearing wall structure with flying buttresses.

==Application==
Depending on the type of building and the number of floors, load-bearing walls are gauged to the appropriate thickness to carry the weight above them. Without doing so, it is possible that an outer wall could become unstable if the load exceeds the strength of the material used, potentially leading to the collapse of the structure. The primary function of this wall is to enclose or divide space of the building to make it more functional and useful. It provides privacy, affords security, and gives protection against heat, cold, sun or rain.

===Housing===
In housing, load-bearing walls are most common in the light construction method known as &quot;platform framing&quot;, and each load-bearing wall sits on a wall sill plate which is mated to the lowest base plate. The sills are bolted to the masonry or concrete foundation.

The &quot;top plate&quot; or &quot;ceiling plate&quot; is the top of the wall, which sits just below the platform of the next floor (at the ceiling). The &quot;base plate&quot; or &quot;floor plate&quot; is the bottom attachment point for the wall studs. Using a top plate and a bottom plate, a wall can be constructed while it lies on its side, allowing for end-nailing of the studs between two plates, and then the finished wall can be tipped up vertically into place atop the wall sill; this not only improves accuracy and shortens construction time, but also produces a stronger wall.

===Skyscrapers===

Due to the immense weight of skyscrapers, the base and walls of the lower floors must be extremely strong. Pilings are used to anchor the building to the bedrock underground. For example, the Burj Khalifa, the world&#x27;s tallest building as well as the world&#x27;s tallest structure, uses specially treated and mixed reinforced concrete. Over of concrete, weighing more than were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles, with each pile being 1.5 m diameter × 43 m long ( × ) and buried more than deep.

==See also==
* Column – in most larger, multi-storey buildings, vertical loads are primarily borne by columns / pillars instead of structural walls
* Tube frame structure – Some of the world&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers use load-bearing outer frames – be it single tube (e.g. the old WTC Twin Towers), or &quot;bundled&quot; tube (e.g. the Willis Tower or the Burj Khalifa)

<text>Messier 21 or M21, also designated NGC 6531 or Webb&#x27;s Cross, is an open cluster of stars located to the north-east of Sagittarius in the night sky, close to the Messier objects M20 to M25 (except M24). It was discovered and catalogued by Charles Messier on June 5, 1764. This cluster is relatively young and tightly packed. A few blue giant stars have been identified in the cluster, but Messier 21 is composed mainly of small dim stars. With a magnitude of 6.5, M21 is not visible to the naked eye; however, with the smallest binoculars it can be easily spotted on a dark night. The cluster is positioned near the Trifid nebula (NGC 6514), but is not associated with that nebulosity. It forms part of the Sagittarius OB1 association.

This cluster is located away from Earth with an extinction of 0.87. Messier 21 is around 6.6 million years old with a mass of . It has a tidal radius of 11.7 pc, with a nucleus radius of and a coronal radius of . There are at least members within the coronal radius down to visual magnitude 15.5, including many early B-type stars. An estimated 40–60 of the observed low-mass members are expected to be pre-main-sequence stars, with 26 candidates identified based upon hydrogen alpha emission and the presence of lithium in the spectrum. The stars in the cluster do not show a significant spread in ages, suggesting that the star formation was triggered all at once.

As of January 2022, Messier 21 is one of the few remaining objects within the Messier Catalog to not have been photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.

<doc id="960585" wikidata="Q2333581" url="?curid=960585" title="Semantic security">
<text>In cryptography, a semantically secure cryptosystem is one where only negligible information about the plaintext can be feasibly extracted from the ciphertext. Specifically, any probabilistic, polynomial-time algorithm (PPTA) that is given the ciphertext of a certain message formula_1 (taken from any distribution of messages), and the message&#x27;s length, cannot determine any partial information on the message with probability non-negligibly higher than all other PPTA&#x27;s that only have access to the message length (and not the ciphertext). This concept is the computational complexity analogue to Shannon&#x27;s concept of perfect secrecy. Perfect secrecy means that the ciphertext reveals no information at all about the plaintext, whereas semantic security implies that any information revealed cannot be feasibly extracted.

==History==
The notion of semantic security was first put forward by Goldwasser and Micali in 1982. However, the definition they initially proposed offered no straightforward means to prove the security of practical cryptosystems. Goldwasser/Micali subsequently demonstrated that semantic security is equivalent to another definition of security called ciphertext indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack. This latter definition is more common than the original definition of semantic security because it better facilitates proving the security of practical cryptosystems.

==Symmetric-key cryptography==
In the case of symmetric-key algorithm cryptosystems, an adversary must not be able to compute any information about a plaintext from its ciphertext. This may be posited as an adversary, given two plaintexts of equal length and their two respective ciphertexts, cannot determine which ciphertext belongs to which plaintext.

==Public-key cryptography==
For an asymmetric key encryption algorithm cryptosystem to be semantically secure, it must be infeasible for a computationally bounded adversary to derive significant information about a message (plaintext) when given only its ciphertext and the corresponding public encryption key. Semantic security considers only the case of a &quot;passive&quot; attacker, i.e., one who generates and observes ciphertexts using the public key and plaintexts of their choice. Unlike other security definitions, semantic security does not consider the case of chosen ciphertext attack (CCA), where an attacker is able to request the decryption of chosen ciphertexts, and many semantically secure encryption schemes are demonstrably insecure against chosen ciphertext attack. Consequently, semantic security is now considered an insufficient condition for securing a general-purpose encryption scheme.

Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) is commonly defined by the following experiment:

# A random pair formula_2 is generated by running formula_3.
# A probabilistic polynomial time-bounded adversary is given the public key formula_4 , which it may use to generate any number of ciphertexts (within polynomial bounds).
# The adversary generates two equal-length messages formula_5 and formula_6, and transmits them to a challenge oracle along with the public key.
# The challenge oracle selects one of the messages by flipping a fair coin (selecting a random bit formula_7), encrypts the message formula_8 under the public key, and returns the resulting &quot;challenging ciphertext&quot; formula_9 to the adversary.

The underlying cryptosystem is IND-CPA (and thus semantically secure under chosen plaintext attack) if the adversary cannot determine which of the two messages was chosen by the oracle, with probability significantly greater than formula_10 (the success rate of random guessing). Variants of this definition define indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA, IND-CCA2).

Because the adversary possesses the public encryption key in the above game, a semantically secure encryption scheme must by definition be probabilistic, possessing a component of randomness; if this were not the case, the adversary could simply compute the deterministic encryption of formula_5 and formula_6 and compare these encryptions with the returned ciphertext formula_9 to successfully guess the oracle&#x27;s choice.

== The Role of Randomness in Semantic Security ==
Randomness plays a key role in cryptography by preventing attackers from detecting patterns in ciphertexts. In a semantically secure cryptosystem, encrypting the same plaintext multiple times should produce different ciphertexts.

If encryption relies on predictable or weak randomness, it becomes easier to break. Poor randomness can lead to patterns that attackers can analyze, potentially allowing them to recover secret keys or decrypt messages. Because of this, cryptographic systems must use strong and unpredictable random values to maintain security.

=== Why Randomness is Important ===
Strong randomness is critical in:

* Key generation – Ensures cryptographic keys are unpredictable.
* Nonce Selection – Reusing a nonce in AES-GCM or ElGamal can break security.
* Probabilistic encryption – Some schemes, like Goldwasser–Micali, rely on randomness to ensure ciphertexts are indistinguishable.

=== Failures of Randomness in the Past ===
Several cryptographic failures have resulted from weak randomness, allowing attackers to break encryption.

==== Debian OpenSSL Vulnerability (2008) ====
An error in Debian’s OpenSSL removed entropy collection, producing a small set of predictable keys. Attackers could guess SSH and TLS keys, allowing unauthorized access.

==== Sony PlayStation 3 ECDSA Failure (2011) ====
Sony’s PlayStation 3 misused the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) by reusing the same nonce - a random number used once in cryptographic signing - in multiple signatures. Since ECDSA relies on unique nonces for security, attackers recovered Sony’s private signing key, allowing them to sign unauthorized software.

==== ROCA Vulnerability (2017) ====
A flaw in Infineon&#x27;s RSA key generation created weak keys that attackers could efficiently factor. This vulnerability affected smart cards and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), requiring widespread key replacements.

=== How to Ensure Strong Randomness ===
To prevent such failures, cryptographic systems must generate unpredictable and high-quality random values.

==== Use of Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generators (CSPRNGs) ====
CSPRNGs provide secure random numbers resistant to attacks. Common examples include:

* /dev/random and /dev/urandom (Unix)
* Windows CryptGenRandom
* NIST-approved DRBGs (Deterministic Random Bit Generators)

==== Entropy Collection ====
Secure randomness requires high entropy sources, such as:

* Hardware-based generators (e.g., Intel RDRAND)
* Physical sources, like keystroke timing
* Dedicated security hardware, including HSMs and TPMs

==== Avoiding Deterministic Encryption Without Randomness ====
Some encryption schemes require added randomness to maintain security:

* RSA with OAEP padding introduces randomness to prevent deterministic encryption.
* Unique nonces in AES-GCM and ElGamal ensure encrypting the same message multiple times produces different ciphertexts.

==== Testing and Auditing Randomness ====
To verify randomness quality, cryptographic implementations should undergo:

* NIST SP 800-90B randomness tests
* Diehard tests
* FIPS 140-2 compliance checks

Semantically secure encryption algorithms include Goldwasser-Micali, ElGamal and Paillier. These schemes are considered provably secure, as their semantic security can be reduced to solving some hard mathematical problem (e.g., Decisional Diffie-Hellman or the Quadratic Residuosity Problem). Other, semantically insecure algorithms such as RSA, can be made semantically secure (under stronger assumptions) through the use of random encryption padding schemes such as Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP).

<text>Robert Lewis Taylor (September 24, 1912 – September 30, 1998) was an American writer and winner of the 1959 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

== Education ==
Born in Carbondale, Illinois, Taylor attended Southern Illinois University for one year. The university now houses his papers. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a bachelor of arts in 1933.

== Career ==
After college, he became a journalist and won awards for reporting. In 1939, he became a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, contributing biographical sketches. His work also appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

From 1942 to 1946, Taylor served in the United States Navy during World War II. During his service, he wrote numerous stories and &quot;Adrift in a Boneyard&quot;, an extended fiction about survivors of a disaster. In 1949,&quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; commissioned a series of biographical sketches of W. C. Fields. He published them together as &quot;W. C. Fields: His Follies and Fortunes.&quot; Taylor continued to write fiction and biographies, including one on Winston Churchill.

Taylor&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters&quot;, about a 14-year-old and his father in the California Gold Rush, won the Pulitzer Prize and was purchased for a film, but eventually became a television series, instead. &quot;A Journey to Matecumbe&quot; was adapted in 1976 as the Disney movie &quot;Treasure of Matecumbe&quot;. His novel &quot;Professor Fodorski&quot; served as the basis for the 1962 musical &quot;All American&quot;.

Taylor died on September 30, 1998.

<text>George Barris (born George Salapatas; November 20, 1925 – November 5, 2015) was an American designer and builder of Hollywood custom cars. Barris designed and built the Hirohata Merc. Barris&#x27;s company, Barris Kustom Industries, designed and built the Munster Koach and DRAG-U-LA for &quot;The Munsters&quot;; and the 1966 Batmobile for the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series and film.

Born in Chicago on November 20, 1925, Barris and his brother Sam moved to California to live with relatives. By his high school graduation, Barris had customized and sold multiple cars. He moved to Los Angeles at the age of eighteen to build custom cars for private buyers, including the Hirohata Merc in 1951. In the 1950s, Barris&#x27;s business became Barris Kustom Industries. Barris&#x27;s company designed and built vehicles for multiple television series in the 1960s, including &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Barris&#x27;s company designed and built custom cars for celebrities and private individuals. His company also built replicas of cars.

Barris died in Encino, Los Angeles on November 5, 2015.

==Early history==
George and his brother Sam (1924–1967) were born in Chicago in the 1920s. Their father was a Greek immigrant from Chios. Their mother died a few years after the brothers were born. When Barris was three years old, Barris&#x27;s father sent the brothers to live with an uncle and his wife in Roseville, California.

By the age of seven, Barris was building and modifying model cars made of balsa wood. His model cars won contests sponsored by hobby shops for careful attention to detail.

The brothers worked at the Greek restaurant owned by their family and were given a dilapidated 1925 Buick for their help. They swiftly restored it to running condition and experimented with changing its appearance. This became the first Barris Brothers custom car. They sold it at a profit to buy another project vehicle. Before George graduated from high school, demand for their work was growing, and they had created a club for owners of custom vehicles, called the Kustoms Car Club. This was the first use of the spelling &quot;Kustom&quot;, which would become associated with Barris.

Barris attended San Juan High School and &quot;rushed to sweep floors at a local auto body shop as soon as school let out&quot;. Barris resisted his family&#x27;s desire for him to work at its Greek restaurant in a Sacramento suburb. He moved to Los Angeles after turning 18 years old to &quot;become part of the emerging teen car culture&quot; and opened the &quot;Barris Custom Shop&quot; on Imperial Highway in Bell, California.

George and Sam Barris built their &quot;kustom&quot; designs for private buyers. George also built and raced his own cars briefly. Soon, Hollywood studio executives and stars wanted the custom cars for personal use and as film props. Robert E. Petersen publicized the Barris cars through car shows and by publishing George&#x27;s how-to articles in &quot;Hot Rod&quot; and &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazines.

==Custom cars and early popularity==

In 1951, the Barris Brothers designed and built the Hirohata Merc as a customer order based on Sam Barris&#x27;s own custom car. The Hirohata Merc was shown at the 1952 General Motors Motorama auto show and was so popular, it overshadowed the best work of Detroit&#x27;s top designers. It also established the early 1950s Mercury as a popular basis for custom car design. In addition, Sam built &quot;Ala Kart&quot;, a 1929 Ford Model A roadster pickup. After taking two AMBR (America&#x27;s Most Beautiful Roadster) wins in a row, the car made numerous film and television appearances, usually in the background of diner scenes.

Sam left the business in the 1950s. George continued in the business with his wife Shirley, and the business became Barris Kustom Industries. The company licensed its designs to model car manufacturers such as Aurora, Revell, MPC, and AMT, which spread the Barris name into the model builder community.

In the early 1960s, Barris, along with other well-known customizers (Gene Winfield, Dean Jeffries and the Alexander Brothers) reworked production cars for Ford&#x27;s &quot;Custom Car Caravan&quot; and &quot;Lincoln/Mercury&#x27;s Caravan of Stars&quot;. The traveling exhibits were designed to appeal to younger car buyers.

Barris also used the body of &quot;Pulsator&quot; (designed by Nye Frank) on his snowmobile dragster show car &quot;Ice Kutter&quot;.

Barris is the subject of the title story in writer Tom Wolfe&#x27;s first collection of essays &quot;The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby&quot;.

==Auto customizing for television, films and celebrities==
According to Barris, some of his first film work was making soft aluminum fenders for a police car that crashes into the rear of a Mercedes-Benz convertible in &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. The idea was to give the collision a comedic quality while also preventing serious damage to the expensive Mercedes. He also built and supplied cars for the 1958 film &quot;High School Confidential&quot; and loaned some of his customs for the &quot;future&quot; scenes in the 1960 film adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. Other Barris-built film cars included a modified Dodge Charger for &quot;Thunder Alley&quot;, a Plymouth Barracuda for &quot;Fireball 500&quot;, the futuristic &quot;Supervan&quot; for a film of the same name, a gadget-filled Mercury station wagon for &quot;The Silencers&quot;, and a sinister rework of a Lincoln Continental Mark III for &quot;The Car&quot;.

In the 1960s, the Barris firm became heavily involved in vehicle design for a television production. At the beginning of the decade, Barris purchased the Lincoln Futura, an extravagantly designed concept car. It remained in his collection for several years, until he was unexpectedly asked by ABC Television to create a signature vehicle for their &quot;Batman&quot; television series. As filming would begin in a few weeks, there was not enough time to create a new design from scratch. Instead, Barris used the Futura as the base for the Batmobile. Barris hired Bill Cushenbery to modify the car, which was ready in three weeks. The show&#x27;s popularity added to Barris&#x27;s fame. Barris owned the Batmobile until he sold it at a 2013 auction.

Other television cars built by Barris Kustom Industries include the Munster Koach and the DRAG-U-LA for &quot;The Munsters&quot;, an Oldsmobile Toronado turned into a roadster used in the first season of &quot;Mannix&quot;, a 1921 Oldsmobile touring car turned into a truck for &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, the fictional &quot;1928 Porter&quot; for the NBC comedy &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;, updated KITTs for later seasons of &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, and replicas of 1914 Stutz Bearcats for &quot;Bearcats!&quot;.

Barris created a customized gold Rolls-Royce for actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. The golden Rolls-Royce displayed the detailed work of Barris and included hand-etched window glass by Robb Rich showing butterflies, roses, and hummingbirds.

Barris built many novelty vehicles for other celebrities. These include golf carts for Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Ann-Margret, Glen Campbell, and Elton John; and 25 modified Mini Mokes for a record company contest involving the Beach Boys. Barris also modified cars for Hollywood stars. Some examples include a Cadillac limousine for Elvis Presley, custom Pontiac station wagons for John Wayne, a Cadillac Eldorado turned into a station wagon for Dean Martin, and a pair of &quot;his &amp; hers&quot; 1966 Ford Mustang convertibles for Sonny and Cher. With the cooperation of American Motors, in 1969 he modified an AMX coupe into the AMX-400 show car, later used in a 1972 episode of &quot;Banacek.&quot;

In the 1990s, NASA contacted Barris to request the designs of the Moonscope vehicle, a 1966 design that was a popular plastic car model for collectors. NASA engineers designing Martian rovers and vehicles were interested in the Moonscope&#x27;s 6-wheel spider suspension and large wedged tires. Edward Lozzi, spokesperson for George Barris, stated, &quot;NASA contacted my office and requested the original designs of the Moonscope from Barris. They revealed they were interested in studying the Barris designs for the Martian vehicles. Barris gave them permission and NASA sent people to meet with him&quot;.

Between 2002 and 2006, Barris also designed two custom Cadillac hearses for episodes of the cable television series &quot;Monster Garage&quot;. Barris&#x27; company often builds replicas of non-Barris designed vehicles from other TV series, including &quot;The Monkees&quot; Monkeemobile, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; (Ford Torino), &quot;Power Rangers&quot; (Turbo Vehicles) and &quot;Knight Rider&quot; KITT. Barris also designed and built the &quot;Wagon Queen Family Truckster&quot;, based on a 1979 Ford Country Squire station wagon, for the 1983 film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;.

==Later career==

In 2005 &quot;The New York Times&quot; had Barris customize a Toyota Prius, which they called one of the most popular yet least attractive cars in the U.S. The budget was $10,000, and a further condition was not to chop the body or interfere with the hybrid mechanics in any way.

In April 2010, the special George Barris design edition of the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro Spirit was introduced to the public for the first time at a VIP media event at Community Chevrolet, one of the largest Chevrolet dealerships in the United States.

On November 29, 2012, Barris Kustom and George Barris announced the sale of the Number 1 Batmobile at the Barrett-Jackson car show and auction held in Scottsdale, Arizona. The world-famous vehicle went on the auction block, on January 19, 2013. The final sale price, after a very intense bidding war, was $4.6 million to car collector Rick Champagne from Arizona.

==&quot;Back to the Future&quot; controversy==
Over a decade after the release of &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, Barris restored one of the DeLorean time machine stunt cars. Barris later purchased a stock DeLorean and converted it into a replica of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; DeLorean, which he used to promote himself and his company. While Barris never officially stated that he had anything to do with the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films, he would state that he had built a &quot;Back to the Future&quot; DeLorean without disclosing that it was a replica car.

In 2007, Universal Studios officials sent Barris a cease and desist order demanding that he never again make &quot;misrepresentations regarding any involvement with the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films&quot;. The order called upon Barris to remove images of the flying DeLorean from his company&#x27;s website and to restrict displaying any replicas of cars from the films. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; writer/producer Bob Gale said, &quot;George Barris had absolutely nothing to do with the design or construction of the DeLorean time travel vehicle.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Barris was married to Shirley Nahas from 1958 until she died in 2001. They had two children. Barris died on November 5, 2015, in his sleep at his home in Encino, Los Angeles, California, fifteen days before his 90th birthday.

<text>Messier 22 or M22, also known as NGC 6656 or the Great Sagittarius Cluster, is an elliptical globular cluster of stars in the constellation Sagittarius, near the Galactic bulge region. It is one of the brightest globulars visible in the night sky. The brightest stars are 11th magnitude, with hundreds of stars bright enough to resolve with an 8&quot; telescope. It is just south of the sun&#x27;s position in mid-December, and northeast of Lambda Sagittarii (Kaus Borealis), the northernmost star of the &quot;Teapot&quot; asterism.

M22 was one of the first globulars to be discovered, in 1665 by Abraham Ihle and it was included in Charles Messier&#x27;s catalog of comet-like objects in 1764. It was one of the first globular clusters to be carefully studied – first by Harlow Shapley in 1930. He placed within it roughly 70,000 stars and found it had a dense core. Then Halton Arp and William G. Melbourne continued studies in 1959. Due to the large color spread of its red giant branch (RGB) sequence, akin to that in Omega Centauri, it became the object of intense scrutiny starting in 1977 with James E. Hesser et al.

M22 is one of the nearer globular clusters to Earth – at about 10,600 light-years away. It spans 32′ on the sky which means its diameter (width across) is 99 ± 9 light-years, given its estimated distance. 32 variable stars have been recorded in M22. It is in front of part of the galactic bulge and is therefore useful for its microlensing effect on those background stars.

Despite its relative proximity to us, this metal-poor cluster&#x27;s light is limited by dust extinction, giving it an apparent magnitude of 5.5; even so, it is the brightest globular cluster visible from mid-northern latitudes (such as Japan, Korea, Europe and most of North America). From those latitudes due to its declination of nearly 24° south of the (celestial) equator, its daily path is low in the southern sky. It thus appears less impressive to people in the temperate northern hemisphere than counterparts fairly near in angle (best viewed in the Summer night sky) such as M13 and M5.

M22 is one of only four globulars of our galaxy known to contain a planetary nebula (an expanding, glowing gas swell from a massive star, often a red giant). It was an object first noted of interest using the IRAS satellite by Fred Gillett and his associates in 1986, as a pointlike light source and its nature was found in 1989 by Gillett et al. The planetary nebula&#x27;s central star is a blue star. The nebula, designated GJJC1, is likely about only 6,000 years old.

Two black holes of between 10 and 20 solar masses () each were unearthed with the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico and corroborated by the Chandra X-ray telescope in 2012. These imply that gravitational ejection of black holes from clusters is not as efficient as was previously thought, and leads to estimates of a total 5 to 100 black holes within M22. Interactions between stars and black holes could explain the unusually large core of the cluster.

<text>The Beatnuts is an American hip hop group and production duo from New York City. Its current members are JuJu and Psycho Les. JuJu (born Jerry Tineo on December 14, 1968) is a Dominican American from Corona and Psycho Les (born Lester Fernandez on April 10, 1970) is a Colombian American from Jackson Heights, Queens. Although only peripheral members, they are routinely acknowledged by Q-Tip as being members of Native Tongues. The Beatnuts were originally a trio before Fashion (born Berntony Smalls on January 13, 1970), now known as Al&#x27; Tariq, left the group to start a solo career. V.I.C. (Groove Merchantz, Ghetto Pros) was also a member of The Beatnuts&#x27; production team for a while.

==History==

===Origins===
JuJu and Psycho Les grew up in different communities in Queens, New York City. Psycho Les started producing beats and DJing at age 15 under aliases including DJ Les Jams and DJ Incredible. At a high school in Flushing, Queens, a friend DJ Loco Moe introduced Les to fellow producer JuJu. While crate digging, both Beatnuts ran into Afrika Baby Bam from the Jungle Brothers. Afrika introduced them to Native Tongues members including De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest and the Jungle Brothers. At this time, JuJu and Psycho Les were DJing parties under the alias Beat Kings. The Jungle Brothers claimed that they were not kings, but rather two nuts for their comical nature and the fact that they were crazy enough to carry hundreds of records to every show they played. They thus changed their name and &quot;it stuck.&quot; Rapper Kool Fashion later got together with the two Beatnuts members.

===Early production work===
The Beatnuts entered the recording industry in 1990 producing two tracks for the British alternative hip hop/electronica group Stereo MCs as well as a song for British rapper Monie Love. Over the next two years, they produced songs for rappers including Common, Pete Nice &amp; DJ Richie Rich and Kurious, as well as a full album for Chi-Ali. As of 1992, JuJu had not appeared on a record, but fellow Beatnuts rappers Fashion and Psycho Les appeared on tracks that he produced. In 1993, The Beatnuts produced more songs for the artists they had previously collaborated with as well as Fat Joe, Suprême NTM and Da Youngsta&#x27;s. At the same time, The Beatnuts made their name as remix specialists by remixing songs for MC Lyte, Da Lench Mob, Naughty by Nature, Jomanda and others.

===Debut albums===
The Beatnuts&#x27; early production work earned them a record deal with Combat Records in 1992. The Beatnuts planned on releasing a &quot;mini-LP&quot; through that label, but its release was delayed when Kool Fashion was sentenced to six months of jail for drug convictions. After Fashion completed his sentence, The Beatnuts left Combat Records and signed deals with Violator Management and Relativity Records. In April 1993, The Beatnuts released their debut album, &quot;Intoxicated Demons: The EP&quot;, through their new label. It featured 11 songs, including the two singles &quot;Reign of the Tec&quot; and &quot;No Equal&quot;. The album was characterized by its hedonistic party-style lyrics and sample-heavy jazz beats. It was a critical success receiving favorable reviews by Allmusic, &quot;The Source&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

&quot;Intoxicated Demons&quot; was followed in 1994 with the eponymous full-length album &quot;The Beatnuts: Street Level&quot;. &quot;Street Level&quot; followed its preceding EP in style, but slightly surpassed its commercial success by charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It featured two singles, &quot;Props Over Here&quot; and &quot;Hit Me with That&quot;, neither of which were commercial hits. &quot;Street Level&quot; was the last Beatnuts album released before Fashion left the group to become a devout Muslim and solo artist under the alias Al&#x27; Tariq. He left The Beatnuts on good terms and collaborated with his former group on future albums.

===Commercial breakthroughs===
The Beatnuts did not follow up their 1994 album until releasing &quot;Stone Crazy&quot; in 1997. Although it contained &quot;Off the Books&quot;, a single that charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, featured a standout performance by Big Pun and the first on-record performance from Cuban Link, the album was not a critical success. Leo Stanley of Allmusic attributed its mediocre reception to its lack of energy—not its &quot;jazz-inflected rhythms and hardcore rhyming&quot;. Chris Ryan of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; conceded that the album was still &quot;something of a breakthrough&quot; for The Beatnuts in spite of itself. Two weeks after the release of &quot;Stone Crazy&quot;, The Beatnuts released &quot;Hydra Beats, Vol. 5&quot;, a small-scale instrumental album. &quot;Vol. 5&quot; was one album in a series of vinyl instrumental albums released by underground label Hydra Entertainment.

1998 saw the release of &quot;The Spot&quot;, a remix EP that revamped songs from the first three non-instrumental Beatnuts albums. It additionally featured sequels to older Beatnuts tracks and one new song, &quot;Treat$&quot;. It was released in anticipation of 1999&#x27;s &quot;A Musical Massacre&quot;, The Beatnuts&#x27; most commercially and critically successful album. &quot;A Musical Massacre&quot; reached #35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 due to its hit single &quot;Watch Out Now&quot;. The album is hailed for its &quot;eclectic&quot; and &quot;textured&quot; beats as well as its &quot;rough, rugged, and raunchy&quot; lyrics with slightly more content variation than past releases.

After Sony released The Beatnuts&#x27;s first hits compilation, 1999&#x27;s &quot;World Famous Classics&quot;, The Beatnuts did not record another album until 2001&#x27;s &quot;Take It or Squeeze It&quot;. Their 2001 album contained two slightly popular singles, &quot;No Escapin&#x27; This&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Git Doe&quot;, but was unable to match the commercial or critical success of &quot;A Musical Massacre&quot;. Reviews by both Allmusic and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; claimed that &quot;Take It or Squeeze It&quot; had a mix of inventive production and clichéd gangster rhymes.

===Return to underground===

In November 2001, it was announced that Loud Records—whose father label Relativity Records had released all Beatnuts albums since their 1993 debut—had cut ties with The Beatnuts. The decision was followed by the release of two greatest hits: 2001&#x27;s &quot;Beatnuts Forever&quot; and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Classic Nuts, Vol. 1&quot;. While The Beatnuts were free agents, a rumor surfaced that JuJu and Psycho Les were going to collaborate with Al&#x27; Tariq under the group alias &#x27;Intoxicated Demons&#x27;. The Beatnuts did not reunite with Al Tariq, but instead signed with the underground label LandSpeed Records. In 2002, they released &quot;The Originators&quot;, a commercial failure that did not reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 or contain charting singles. The album was still a critical success because of its catchy hooks and creative beats. Steve Juon of RapReviews.com remarked on the correlation between The Beatnuts&#x27; critical and commercial success: If they are less known and don&#x27;t sell as well being on an indie imprint like LandSpeed Records, it will still be worth it if the increased quality of their beats and rhymes remain this high.

Instead of remaining on LandSpeed Records, The Beatnuts signed to Penalty Recordings before releasing their 2004 album &quot;Milk Me&quot;. Although Penalty was also an underground label, &quot;Milk Me&quot; was still able to scrape the bottom of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was almost unanimously held to be solid. Nonetheless, three singles and an Akon guest appearance did not propel the album to the commercial success of prior Beatnuts albums.

====&quot;Watch Out Now&quot; controversy====
&quot;Milk Me&quot; contained the song &quot;Confused Rappers&quot;, a track that dissed Jennifer Lopez for allegedly stealing the beat from The Beatnuts&#x27; &quot;Watch Out Now&quot; on her 2002 hit &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot;. The song criticizes Lopez&#x27;s singing ability and looks, but ultimately criticizes the track&#x27;s producers, Trackmasters and Cory Rooney, for allegedly stealing the beat. Although The Beatnuts did eventually receive royalties, Psycho Les is still critical of the track&#x27;s producers. The beats on both &quot;Watch Out Now&quot; and &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot; sample the Enoch Light cover of &quot;Hi-Jack&quot; by Fernando Arbex of the Spanish group Barrabás. Barrabás created the original drum and bass lines, with the flute transposition of the melodic loop (the famous sample in the Beatnuts and Jennifer Lopez tracks) introduced in the Herbie Mann and Enoch Light covers.

===Recent endeavors===
In March 2007, Psycho Les released his debut solo album &quot;Psycho Therapy (The Soundtrack)&quot; on Pit Fight Records. Psycho Les additionally joined with Al Tariq and Problemz to form the group Big City. In June, they released &quot;The City Never Sleeps&quot; on Nature Sounds.

Later that year, The Beatnuts had a track included on the &quot;Official Joints&quot; mixtape, a collection of previously unreleased songs by NYC rappers.

In December, JuJu was arrested in Stockholm, Sweden for an alleged assault. He was detained for 36 hours for a &quot;minor assault&quot; after performing a concert.

On September 30, 2008, Pit Fight Records released &quot;U.F.O. Files&quot;, a compilation of previously unreleased Beatnuts songs.

In October 2009, &quot;Deez Nuts&quot;, a semi-autobiographical theatre production conceived by Sacha Jenkins and starring The Beatnuts ran for 3 nights at the Ohio Theatre as part of the New York Hip-Hop Theater Festival.

The Beatnuts partnered with the West Coast Hip hop group Tha Alkaholiks in 2016 to make a super crew known as the Liknuts which toured together.

Both JuJu and Psycho Les contributed beats for Tony Touch&#x27;s The Piece Maker 3: Return of the 50 MC&#x27;s,

They went Tik Tok Viral with the song &quot;Se Acabo&quot; and re-released it in Remix version in 2022 featuring Method Man.

==Style==
The Beatnuts are known for their sample-heavy beats and explicit party-ready lyrics. In early records, the beats had a jazz and funk-influenced sound, but later songs were influenced by Latin music. Critics have commented that The Beatnuts have consistently good beats, but lack in terms of lyrics. JuJu addressed this in a 2004 interview:

<text>Songs for Polarbears is the debut studio album by Northern Irish–Scottish alternative rock band Snow Patrol, released on 31 August 1998 in the United Kingdom and 12 October in the United States.

The album charted at #143 in the UK and did not sell well upon its initial release. However, its re-release eventually went Gold in the UK.

The album title is a reference to the band&#x27;s previous name Polarbear.

==Track listing==

*&quot;Marketplace&quot; (3:48) is included as a hidden track after &quot;One Hundred Things You Should Have Done in Bed&quot; on both versions.

<doc id="960620" wikidata="Q433841" url="?curid=960620" title="Johannes de Sacrobosco">
<text>Johannes de Sacrobosco, also written Ioannes de Sacro Bosco, later called John of Holywood or John of Holybush ( 1195 – 1256), was a scholar, Catholic monk, and astronomer who taught at the University of Paris.

He wrote a short introduction to the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. Judging from the number of manuscript copies that survive today, for the next 400 years it became the most widely read book on that subject. He also wrote a short textbook which was widely read and influential in Europe during the later medieval centuries as an introduction to astronomy. In his longest book, on the computation of the date of Easter, Sacrobosco correctly described the defects of the then-used Julian calendar, and recommended a solution similar to the modern Gregorian calendar three centuries before its implementation.

Very little is known about the education and biography of Sacrobosco. For one thing, his year of death has been guessed at 1236, 1244, and 1256, each of which is plausible and each lacking adequate evidence.

==Place of birth==
The country in which he was born is uncertain. Robertus Anglicus wrote in 1271 that Sacrobosco was born in England. That could be true, yet there is neither good supporting nor good contradicting evidence for it. Based on Anglicus writing so soon after Sacrobosco&#x27;s death, a birthplace in England may deserve greater credence than later suggestions.

Among those other possibilities, several different tenuous efforts have been made to figure out his birthplace from his appellative name &quot;de Sacrobosco&quot;. Long after his death, Johannes de Sacrobosco was called and sometimes is still called by the name &quot;John of Holywood&quot; or &quot;John of Holybush&quot;, a name which was constructed by post-hoc reverse translation of the Medieval Latin &quot; &quot;, &quot;holy (sacred) wood&quot;. &quot;Sacer Boscus&quot; or Romance &quot;Sacro Bosco&quot; as such is an unknown town or region. One traditional report, that he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, is the speculation of a 16th-century antiquary, John Leland, which was discredited by William Camden: &quot;Halifax&quot; means &quot;holy hair&quot;, not &quot;holy wood&quot;.

Thomas Dempster identified Sacrobosco with an Augustinian canon from Holywood Abbey, Nithsdale, which would be a reason for supposing him to have been born in Scotland. The historian John Veitch claimed that he was born in Galloway and studied the classics among the monks of Whithorn and Dryburgh.

Based on a suggestion by Stanihurst, Holywood, County Down also claims Sacrobosco. However, Pederson attributes this assertion to Holywood being familiar to Stanihurst. A similar claim is made that he was born in Holywood, County Wicklow, but there is no known supporting historical document.

Pederson mentioned that James Ware, writing in 1639, believed that the birthplace of Sacrobosco was near Dublin. Stanihurst and even Pederson were probably unaware that the seat of the Sacrobosco / Hollywood family in Ireland was in Artane, a suburb of Dublin. Local historical records in Ireland seem to indicate that Johannes de Sacrobosco was a member of the Hollywood family, born in Artane Castle.

==Life==
The story that he was educated at the University of Oxford is no better documented than the stories on his place of birth.

According to a seventeenth-century account, he arrived at the University of Paris on 5 June 1221, but whether as a student or as a graduate (&quot;licentiate&quot; – one already having a Master of Arts degree from another university, and thus qualified to teach) is unclear. In due course, he began to teach the mathematical disciplines at the University of Paris.

The year of his death is uncertain, with evidence supporting the years 1234, 1236, 1244, and 1256. The inscription marking his burial place in the monastery of Saint-Mathurin, Paris, described him as a &quot;computist&quot; – one who was an expert on calculating the date of Easter.
:De Sacrobosco qui Joannes
:tempora discrevit, iacet hic a tempore raptus.
:Tempora qui sequeris, memor esto quod morieris.
:Si miser es, plora: miserans pro me procor ora.

On 14 May 2021, asteroid 14541 Sacrobosco, discovered by Czech astronomers Jana Tichá and Miloš Tichý in 1997, was in his memory.

==&quot;Tractatus de Sphaera&quot;==

About 1230, his best-known work, &quot;Tractatus de Sphaera / De Sphaera Mundi&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Sphere / On the Sphere of the World&quot;) was published. In this book, Sacrobosco gives a readable account of the Ptolemaic universe. Ptolemy&#x27;s (updated) Almagest had been translated into Latin in 1175 by Gerard of Cremona from the Arabic translation held in Toledo and copies had quickly found their way to Paris. In addition Sacrobosco was able to draw on translations of the Arabic astronomers Thabit ibn Qurra, al-Biruni, al-Urdi, and al-Fargani.

The &quot;sphere&quot; Sacrobosco was referring to is the &quot;celestial sphere&quot; – an imaginary backdrop of the stars in the sky – which was the meaning of the word &quot;mundi&quot; (&quot;world&quot;) at that time, &quot;not&quot; the planet Earth. Though principally about astronomy, in its first chapter the book also contains a clear description of the Earth as a sphere. &quot;De Sphaera Mundi&quot; was required reading by students in all western European universities for the next four hundred years.

==&quot;Algorismus&quot;==
Sacrobosco&#x27;s &quot;Algorismus&quot; a.k.a. &quot;De Arte Numerandi&quot; is thought to have been his first work, written c. 1225. The Hindu–Arabic methods of numerical calculation had arrived in Latin Europe during the previous fifty years but had not been disseminated on a wide scale. Sacrobosco&#x27;s &quot;Algorismus&quot; was the first text to introduce Hindu–Arabic numerals and arithmetical procedures into the European university curriculum.

==&quot;De Anni Ratione&quot;==
Sacrobosco may now be most famous for his criticism of the Julian calendar. In his book on computation of Easter&#x27;s date, &quot;De Anni Ratione&quot; [&quot;On Reckoning Years&quot;], he maintained that the calendar had accumulated an error of 10 days and that some correction was needed.

The Julian calendar was instituted in the 1st century BCE. The Julian calendar year contained 365.25 days, with the 0.25 day provided for by a Leap year once every fourth year. However, the more precise length of a solar year is about 365.2422 days. By the 13th century, the less accurate 365.25 days had resulted in an accumulated error of about 10 days in the date of the vernal equinox. Sacrobosco made no proposal on how to get rid of the accumulated error. But looking to the future, he proposed to leave one day out of the calendar every 288 years to prevent further error. His criticism would foreshadow the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, which corrected the error observed by Sacrobosco by skipping 10 days, and dropping three of the century leap years in every 400-year period.

<doc id="960632" wikidata="Q977920" url="?curid=960632" title="Thaddeus McCotter">
<text>Thaddeus George McCotter (born August 22, 1965) is an American politician, radio host, and a member of the Republican Party. He was the U.S. representative from from 2003 to 2012. The district at the time consisted of portions of Detroit&#x27;s northwestern suburbs, such as Livonia, Westland and Novi. He was also a candidate for the Republican nomination for president in the 2012 election.

McCotter first entered politics in 1992 when he was elected to the Wayne County Commission. He then served in the Michigan Senate from 1999 to 2003. In 2002, McCotter was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. From July to September 2011, McCotter was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination for the 2012 race. After a last place finish in the Iowa Straw Poll in August and failing to secure a spot in the presidential debates, McCotter suspended his campaign.

After ending his presidential campaign, McCotter decided to run again for his seat in Congress, but he failed to qualify for the 2012 Republican primary in his congressional district after most of his petition signatures were rejected as invalid. McCotter himself was not suspected of wrongdoing, though several of his staffers were charged with duplicating signatures and other electoral crimes, and some convicted. McCotter later sued some of the perpetrators for damage to his reputation, but fallout from the ensuing scandal resulted in McCotter&#x27;s resignation from Congress in July 2012.

==Early life, education, and career==
McCotter was born in Detroit, Michigan, and is a 1983 graduate of Detroit Catholic Central High School in Redford. His mother, Georgia Joan McCotter, was the city clerk of Livonia.
He received a B.A. from the University of Detroit in 1987 and a J.D. from the same school in 1990.

McCotter had a private law practice and was a Schoolcraft College trustee before being elected to the Wayne County Commission in 1992. While on the commission, he worked to change the county charter to require that new taxes require the approval of two-thirds of the Commission and 60% of voters.

McCotter was elected to the Michigan State Senate in 1998. As a state senator, he helped apportion the U.S. Congressional district from which he was subsequently elected in 2002.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises
** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
** Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy and Trade

====Party leadership and caucus memberships====
* Congressional COPD Caucus
* House Sovereignty Caucus (co-founder)
* International Conservation Caucus
* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus

Shortly before the midterm elections in November 2006, McCotter made a $250,000 contribution to the National Republican Congressional Committee. After the elections, when the Republicans became the minority party in the House of Representatives, McCotter was elected chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, the fifth-ranking post among House Republicans. The other Republican seeking the post was Congressman Darrell Issa of southern California.

==Political positions==
McCotter was a member of both the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership and the conservative Republican Study Committee.

In May 2007, McCotter, along with 55 other Republicans, voted for a bill written by House Democrats aimed at stopping energy price gouging, against the wishes of House Minority Leader John Boehner, who labeled the bill &quot;as pointless political pandering&quot;.

McCotter was a supporter of the United States&#x27; involvement in both the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. In his 2011 book &quot;Seize Freedom!&quot;, he wrote that the wars &quot;were never separate wars; they have always been battle theaters in the War for Freedom.&quot;

On September 22, 2008, McCotter became the first Republican in the House of Representatives to oppose the $700 billion Paulson bailout plan, calling it &quot;American socialism&quot;. A week later, he and 132 other Republicans voted against the bill.

At the end of July 2009, McCotter introduced a bill to allow pet owners a $3,500 tax deduction for pet care costs.
The bill, called the &quot;Humanity and Pets Partnered Through the Years&quot; (HAPPY) Act, was criticized by Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center as &quot;the poster puppy for all that is wrong with the tax code.&quot;

McCotter supported union-friendly measures including collective bargaining agreements for government jobs and card check, although he later said his vote for the so-called card check method was a mistake.

==Political campaigns==
McCotter was elected in November 2002, defeating Democratic Candidate Kevin Kelley of Redford, to the 108th Congress. He was reelected in the 2004 Congressional elections. McCotter ran unopposed in the 2006 Republican primary. His opponent in the November 2006 general election was Democrat Tony Trupiano, a progressive radio talk show host from Dearborn Heights. McCotter, Trupiano, Libertarian Party nominee John Tatar, and U.S. Taxpayers Party nominee Charles Tackett met only once for a recorded League of Women Voters public forum in mid-October. In radio and direct-mail advertisements, McCotter criticized Trupiano&#x27;s position on illegal immigration, and he was reelected with 55 percent of the vote.

In November 2008, McCotter defeated Democrat Joseph Larkin, Green Party candidate Erik Shelley, and Libertarian John Tatar. McCotter won 51 percent of the vote to Larkin&#x27;s 45 percent. In November 2010, McCotter defeated Democrat Natalie Mosher with 59 percent of the vote to Mosher&#x27;s 39 percent.

===2012 presidential campaign===

In May 2011, McCotter confirmed that he was considering a run for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States in 2012.
By late June, sources indicated that McCotter would enter the race.
On June 23, 2011, a McCotter representative bid $18,000 for a site at the Ames Straw Poll Auction in Iowa.
On July 1, 2011, McCotter announced that he had filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as a candidate for president.
On July 2, 2011, McCotter announced his candidacy at WAAM Freedom Fest in Whitmore Lake, Michigan, outside of Detroit.

Throughout his campaign, commentators suggested that McCotter&#x27;s lack of name recognition nationwide would hamper his chances of winning the nomination. In opinion polls that included McCotter, he received less than one percent and he came in last place in the August 2011 Ames Straw Poll. On September 22, 2011, McCotter announced the end of his campaign for the presidential nomination, and said that his exclusion from presidential debates had hindered it. Given the lack of media coverage of his campaign, McCotter called the end of his presidential campaign &quot;death by media.&quot; He said he would endorse Mitt Romney and would run again for his 11th congressional district in 2012.

===2012 congressional campaign and petition scandal===
In April 2011, McCotter was the only member of Michigan&#x27;s 15-member congressional delegation who did not confirm he was running for reelection. He indicated interest in running against incumbent Democrat Debbie Stabenow for the U.S. Senate seat in Michigan in 2012, but in May 2011 announced that he would not campaign for the position.

After announcing his intention to run for reelection, McCotter was expected to win the Republican nomination easily, but on May 25, 2012, Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson announced that he had failed to submit enough valid petition signatures to qualify for the August 7 primary ballot. Although McCotter had submitted 2,000 signatures, the maximum permitted by Michigan law for congressional primaries, a preliminary review indicated that fewer than the required minimum of 1,000 were valid. According to a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State&#x27;s office, several of McCotter&#x27;s petition signatures were duplicates. Michigan election law stipulates that if duplicates are found, both the original and duplicate are ruled invalid. McCotter had the option of running as a write-in candidate in the primary election or as an independent in the general election if he failed to qualify for a primary ballot spot.

At the time the apparent fraud was uncovered, McCotter was on a congressional trip to Taiwan. On May 26, a source within McCotter&#x27;s campaign told the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; that McCotter conceded that the signatures would be ruled invalid, and that he was considering a write-in effort. McCotter confirmed this to Nolan Finley of &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, adding that he did not understand what happened with the signatures on the petitions.

Later that day, state officials announced in two separate reviews that more than 85 percent of McCotter&#x27;s petition signatures were invalid. The Secretary of State&#x27;s office said its review revealed only 244 of 2,000 signatures were valid. Numerous petition sheets appeared to have been copied—in some cases, as many as three times—and in some cases a different canvasser&#x27;s name was attached to one of the copies. Michigan elections director Chris Thomas conducted his own review, and said there was evidence signatures from 2010 petitions had been cut-and-pasted onto the 2012 sheets. Thomas also said that McCotter had only turned in 1,830 signatures, and all but 244 were invalid. His office&#x27;s review revealed that dozens of petition sheets appeared to have been copied in what he described as an &quot;unprecedented level&quot; of fraud.

Late on May 27, the Secretary of State&#x27;s office announced that it found the potential fraud egregious enough to ask state attorney general Bill Schuette to look into the matter. In an op-ed that ran in the May 29, 2012, &quot;Detroit News&quot;, McCotter announced he would mount a write-in campaign in the Republican primary for his seat. He also acknowledged that the signatures in question were indeed invalid, based on his own legal team&#x27;s review. Likening himself to George Bailey in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, McCotter said that he was running a write-in campaign to &quot;clean up my own mess.&quot;

On June 2, McCotter announced that he was ending his bid for reelection and would leave the House at the end of his term. In his statement, he said that he felt obligated to fulfill his duties in Congress and assist Schuette and Johnson in getting to the bottom of the petition fraud. These obligations, he said, made mounting a write-in bid for Congress impossible. &quot;One can&#x27;t clean up a mess multitasking,&quot; he said. McCotter was the first sitting congressman since the late 1940s not to qualify for his party&#x27;s primary.

A month later, on July 5, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported that McCotter had spent much of the time since his presidential campaign failed writing a television pilot script for a comedy/variety show starring himself, to be called &quot;Bumper Sticker: Made on MoTown&quot;. It featured characters with the same nicknames he used for members of his staff and a guest appearance by conservative commentator S. E. Cupp. &quot;They take pot shots about McCotter&#x27;s ill-fated bid for the White House while spewing banter about drinking, sex, race, flatulence, puking and women&#x27;s anatomy&quot;, the newspaper wrote.

===Resignation and aftermath===
On July 6, 2012, McCotter resigned from the House. He said:

He also wrote:

While McCotter was not suspected of any wrongdoing, several of his staff members were charged with crimes. District Director Paul Seewald pleaded guilty to falsely signing a petition and was given two years of probation. Deputy District Director Don Yowchuang pleaded no contest to ten counts of felony forgery and was given three years of probation. Scheduler Lorraine O&#x27;Brady pleaded no contest to five counts of falsely signing a nominating petition and was sentenced to 20 days in jail. District Representative Mary M. Turnbull pleaded no contest to the felony of committing an illegal act and was sentenced to two years of probation and one day in jail.

McCotter&#x27;s resignation left the 11th district unrepresented until the November elections, when Democrat David Curson was elected in a special election to finish McCotter&#x27;s term. Republican Kerry Bentivolio succeeded Curson in January 2013 as the representative of the redrawn 11th district.

==Post-congressional career==
In January 2014, McCotter launched &quot;Thaddeus McCotter&#x27;s Freedom Asylum&quot;, a radio program on FM 92.7 &amp; AM 1400, The Patriot in Detroit. It was canceled by June 2014.

In June 2017, McCotter served as an election observer in the Puerto Rico political-status referendum. McCotter regularly appears on the &quot;John Batchelor Show&quot; radio program, on Cumulus Media, across the United States.

==Personal life==
McCotter is a practicing Catholic.

In December 2005, McCotter joined with several other Congressmen to form the &quot;Second Amendments&quot;, a bipartisan rock and country band set to play for United States troops stationed overseas over the holiday season. He played lead guitar. In June 2006, the band played at President George W. Bush&#x27;s picnic on the White House lawn, where Bush was quoted calling McCotter &quot;that rock-and-roll dude&quot;. McCotter was once in a band called the New Flying Squirrels.

<text>Margaret Ellis Millar (née Sturm; February 5, 1915 – March 26, 1994) was a Canadian-American mystery and suspense writer.

Born in Berlin, Ontario (the city would change its name to Kitchener in 1916), she was educated at the Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate Institute and the University of Toronto. She moved to the United States after marrying Kenneth Millar (better known under the pen name Ross Macdonald). They resided for decades in the city of Santa Barbara, which was often used as a locale in her later novels under the pseudonyms of San Felice or Santa Felicia. The Millars had a daughter, Linda, who died in 1970. 

==Styles and themes==

Millar&#x27;s books are distinguished by depth of characterization. Often we are shown the rather complex interior lives of the people in her books, with issues of class, insecurity, failed ambitions, loneliness or existential isolation or paranoia often being explored. Unusual people, mild societal misfits or people who don&#x27;t quite fit into their surroundings are given much interior detail. In some of the books (for example in &quot;The Iron Gates&quot;) we are given insight into what it feels like to be losing touch with reality and evolving into madness. In general, she is a writer of both expressive description and economy, often ambitious in conveying the sociological context of the stories.

Millar often delivers &quot;surprise endings,&quot; but the details that would allow the solution of the surprise have usually been subtly included, in the best genre tradition. Her books focus on subtleties of human interaction and rich psychological detail of individual characters as much as on plot.

Millar was a pioneer in writing about the psychology of women. Even as early as the &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s, her books have a mature and matter-of-fact view of class distinctions, sexual freedom and frustration, and the ambivalence of moral codes depending on a character&#x27;s economic circumstances. Read against the backdrop of Production Code-era movies of the time, they remind us that life as lived in the &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s was not as black-and-white morally as Hollywood would have us believe.

It has been argued that Millar &quot;essentially created a new hybrid form of literature: detective literature&quot; in contrast to formulaic genre stories.

Many websites cite her as working as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers just after World War II, but no further details are given as to what she may have worked on, even on imdb.com. Around that time, Warners bought the option on her novel &quot;The Iron Gates,&quot; with its portrait of a woman descending into madness, but reportedly Bette Davis and other prominent Warner Brothers actresses ultimately turned it down because the memorable protagonist is missing for the last third of the story. The film was never produced. In the early &#x27;60s, two of her novels (&quot;Beast in View&quot; and &quot;Rose&#x27;s Last Summer,&quot; the latter starred Mary Astor) were adapted for the anthology TV series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;.

While she was not known for any one recurring detective (unlike her husband, whose constant gumshoe was Lew Archer), she occasionally used a detective character for more than one novel. Among her occasional ongoing sleuths were Canadians Dr. Paul Prye (her first invention, in the earliest books) and Inspector Sands (a quiet, unassuming Canadian police inspector who might be the most endearing of her recurring inventions). In the California years, a few books featured either Joe Quinn, a rather down-on-his-luck private eye, or Tom Aragon, a young, Hispanic lawyer.

Most of Millar&#x27;s books are still in print in America. Starting in 2016, Soho Syndicate has published a large selection of omnibus re-issues grouped by theme. Many are available as single ebooks.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1956, Millar won the Edgar Allan Poe Awards Best Novel award for &quot;Beast in View&quot;. Two later novels were also nominated for Best Novel. In 1965 she was awarded the Woman of the Year Award by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In 1983, she was awarded the Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America in recognition of her lifetime achievements.

In 1987, critic and mystery writer H.R.F Keating included Millar&#x27;s &quot;Beast In View&quot; in his &quot;Crime &amp; Mystery: The 100 Best Books&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Margaret Millar is surely one of late twentieth-century crime fiction&#x27;s best writers, in the sense that the actual writing in her books, the prose, is of superb quality. On almost every page of this one there is some description, whether of a physical thing or a mental state, that sends a sharp ray of extra meaning into the reader&#x27;s mind.&quot;

==Birding==
As evidenced by her birdwatching memoir, birding was an important part of the lives of Margaret Millar and her husband. The couple were founding members of the Santa Barbara Audubon Society. She was a member of the inaugural SBAS Board and Conservation Chair. Millar was an early participant in the American Birding Association&#x27;s Rare Bird Alert, founded in Santa Barbara in 1963. She also served in the National Audubon Society.

<doc id="960657" wikidata="Q1319302" url="?curid=960657" title="The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp">
<text>The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is a 1943 British romantic-war film written, produced and directed by the British film-making team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It stars Roger Livesey, Deborah Kerr and Anton Walbrook. The title derives from the satirical Colonel Blimp comic strip by David Low, but the story is original. Although the film is strongly pro-British, it is a satire on the British Army, especially its leadership. It suggests that Britain faced the option of following traditional notions of honourable warfare or to &quot;fight dirty&quot; in the face of such an evil enemy as Nazi Germany.

One film critic has described it as &quot;England&#x27;s greatest film ever&quot; and it is renowned for its sophistication and directorial brilliance as well as for its script, the performances of its large cast and for its pioneering Technicolor cinematography. Among its distinguished company of actors, particular praise has been reserved for Livesey, Walbrook and Kerr.

The film was ranked 45th in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 1999 list of the top 100 British films and 80th in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.

== Plot ==

Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy is a senior commander in the British Home Guard during World War II. Before a training exercise, he is &quot;captured&quot; in a Victorian Turkish bath by British Army troops led by Lieutenant &quot;Spud&quot; Wilson, who has struck pre-emptively. He ignores Clive&#x27;s outraged protests that &quot;War starts at midnight!&quot; They scuffle and fall into a bathing pool. An extended flashback ensues.

In 1902, Clive is on leave from the Second Boer War, where his service has earned him the Victoria Cross. He receives a letter from Edith Hunter, who is working in Berlin. Edith complains that a German man named Kaunitz is spreading anti-British propaganda regarding Britain&#x27;s role in the conflict, and wants the British embassy to intervene. When Clive brings this to his superiors&#x27; attention, they refuse him permission to go to Berlin, but he goes anyway. In Berlin, Clive and Edith go to a café, where he confronts Kaunitz. Provoked, Clive inadvertently insults the Imperial German Army&#x27;s officer corps. The Germans insist he fight a duel with an officer chosen by drawing lots, which ends up being Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff. In the duel, both Clive and Theo suffer injuries, but become friends while recuperating. Edith visits the duo regularly and, although she has feelings for Clive, becomes engaged to Theo. Clive is delighted, but soon realises that he also loves her. Upon returning home, Clive takes Edith&#x27;s sister Martha to the opera, which does not result in a relationship.

In November 1918, Clive, now at the rank of brigadier general, believes the Allies won World War I because &quot;right is might&quot;. While in France with his driver Murdoch, Clive meets nurse Barbara Wynne, who bears a striking resemblance to Edith. He courts and marries her despite their 20-year age difference, while Murdoch becomes their butler. In July 1919, Clive tracks Theo down at a British prisoner-of-war camp in Derbyshire. Clive greets him as if nothing has changed, but Theo snubs him. On 26 August, about to be repatriated to Germany, Theo apologises and accepts an invitation to Clive&#x27;s house. He remains sceptical that his country will be treated fairly by the Allies. Barbara dies in August 1926, and Clive retires from the Army in 1935.

In November 1939, Theo relates to a British immigration official how he was estranged from his children when they became Nazis. Before World War II, he refused to move to England when Edith wanted; by the time he was ready, she had died. Clive vouches for Theo, and reveals to him that he loved Edith and only realised it after it was too late. Theo meets Angela &quot;Johnny&quot; Cannon, who is Clive&#x27;s MTC driver; Theo is struck by her resemblance to Barbara and Edith. Clive, restored to the active list as a major-general, is to give a BBC radio talk regarding the retreat from Dunkirk. Clive plans to say he would rather lose the war than win it using the methods employed by the Nazis, but his talk is cancelled. Theo urges Clive to accept the need to fight and win by whatever means are necessary because the consequences of losing are so dire.

Clive again is retired, but, at Theo&#x27;s and Angela&#x27;s urging, turns his energy to the Home Guard, and his efforts in building this organisation win him national press attention. His house is bombed in the Blitz, killing Murdoch, and it is replaced by an emergency water supply cistern. Clive moves to his club, where he relaxes in a Turkish bath before a training exercise he has arranged. Wilson is revealed as Angela&#x27;s boyfriend, who used her to learn about Clive&#x27;s plans and location. She tries to warn Clive, but it is too late. Theo and Angela find Clive sitting across the street from where his house stood. He recalls that after being dressed down by his superior for causing the diplomatic incident, he declined the man&#x27;s invitation to dinner, and often regretted doing so. He tells Angela to invite her boyfriend to dine with him. Years before, Clive promised Barbara that he would &quot;never change&quot; until his house was flooded and &quot;this is a lake&quot;. Seeing the cistern, he realises that &quot;here is the lake and I still haven&#x27;t changed&quot;. Clive salutes the new guard as it passes by him.

== Cast ==
Cast notes:
* Making their second appearance in &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; were director Michael Powell&#x27;s golden cocker spaniels, Erik and Spangle, who had appeared in &quot;Contraband&quot; (1940), and were seen in the Powell and Pressburger films &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (1945) and &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (US: &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, 1946).

== Production ==

=== Writing and casting ===
According to the directors, the idea for the film did not come from the newspaper comic strip by David Low but from a scene cut from their previous film &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1942), in which an elderly member of the crew tells a younger one: &quot;You don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to be old.&quot; Powell has stated that the idea was suggested by David Lean (then a film editor) who, when removing the scene from the film, mentioned that the premise of the conversation was worthy of a film.

Powell wanted Laurence Olivier (who had appeared in Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;49th Parallel&quot; and &quot;The Volunteer&quot;) to play Candy. However, the Ministry of Information refused to release Olivier—who was serving in the Fleet Air Arm—from active service, telling Powell and Pressburger &quot;we advise you not to make it and you can&#x27;t have Laurence Olivier because he&#x27;s in the Fleet Air Arm and we&#x27;re not going to release him to play your Colonel Blimp&quot;.

Powell wanted Wendy Hiller to play Kerr&#x27;s parts but she withdrew due to pregnancy.

Frau von Kalteneck, a friend of Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, was played by Roger Livesey&#x27;s wife Ursula Jeans. Although they often appeared on stage together, this was their only appearance together in a film.

=== Churchill&#x27;s disapproval ===
Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prompted by objections from James Grigg, his Secretary of State for War, wrote to Brendan Bracken, the Minister of Information: &quot;Pray propose to me the measures necessary to stop this foolish production before it gets any further.&quot; Grigg warned that the public&#x27;s belief in the &quot;Blimp conception of the Army officer&quot; would be given &quot;a new lease of life&quot;. There is also a certain similarity between Candy and Churchill, and some historians have suggested that Churchill may have mistaken the film for a parody of himself (having also served in the Boer War and the First World War). His exact reasons remain unclear, but he was acting only on a description of the planned film from his staff, not on a viewing of the film itself.

Bracken was uncomfortable with Churchill&#x27;s request, and replied he had no power to do so. After Ministry of Information and War Office officials had viewed a rough cut, objections were withdrawn in May 1943. Churchill&#x27;s disapproval remained, however, and at his insistence an export ban, much exploited in advertising by the British distributors, remained in place until August of that year. In an interview for a 1971 booklet, Powell revealed that he wanted to portray Blimp as &quot;a symbol of British procrastination and British regard for tradition and all the things which we know are losing the war&quot;.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in four months at Denham Film Studios and on location in and around London, and at Denton Hall in Yorkshire. Filming was made difficult by the wartime shortages and by Churchill&#x27;s objections leading to a ban on the production crew having access to any military personnel or equipment. But they still managed to &quot;find&quot; quite a few Army vehicles and plenty of uniforms.

Michael Powell said of &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; that it is 

At other times he also pointed out that the designer was German, and the leads included Austrian and Scottish actors.

The military adviser for the film was Lieutenant General Douglas Brownrigg (1886–1946), whose own career was rather similar to Wynne-Candy&#x27;s, as he had served with distinction in the First World War, was retired after the Dunkirk evacuation, and then took a senior role in the Home Guard.

=== Score ===
For the music, recorded by music director Charles Williams, Allan Gray used some existing pieces (Mendelssohn, Offenbach, Wagner), while composing new music to illustrate Britain&#x27;s gradual change in attitude to war from the days of the Boer War onwards. These include &#x27;I see you everywhere&#x27; (a foxtrot), &#x27;The mill goes round and around&#x27; (a waltz), and &#x27;Colonel Blimp March&#x27;. John Huntley highlights the use of jazz as background scoring for the sequence depicting a Home Guard operation in progress, during which &#x27;Colonel Blimp&#x27; is captured while in a Turkish bath. As &#x27;Commando Patrol&#x27; this piece achieved popularity under its own right, recorded by The Squadronaires in 1943.

=== Locations ===
* The Bull, Oxford Road, Gerrards Cross (Spud&#x27;s rendezvous with Angela)
* Denton Hall, Wharfedale (Wynne family home)
* 15 Ovington Square, Kensington (Aunt Margaret&#x27;s, and later, Clive and Barbara&#x27;s house; called 33 Cadogan Place in the script)
* 139 Park Lane, Mayfair (Home Guard Headquarters)

== Reception upon original release ==
The film was released in the UK in 1943. The première, organised by Lady Margaret Alexander, took place on 10 June at the Odeon Leicester Square, London, with all proceeds donated to the Odeon Services and Seamen&#x27;s Fund. The film was heavily attacked on release mainly because of its sympathetic presentation of a German officer, albeit an anti-Nazi one, who is more down-to-earth and realistic than the central British character. Sympathetic German characters had appeared in the films of Powell and Pressburger, for example &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; and &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, the latter of which was made during the war.

The film provoked the extremist pamphlet &quot;The Shame and Disgrace of Colonel Blimp&quot; by &quot;right-wing sociologists E.W. and M.M. Robson&quot;, members of the obscure Sidneyan Society, which proclaimed it a &quot;highly elaborate, flashy, flabby and costly film, the most disgraceful production that has ever emanated from a British film studio.&quot;

The film was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1943, after &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

Due to the British government&#x27;s disapproval of the film, it was not released in the United States until 1945 and then in a modified form, in black and white as &quot;The Adventures of Colonel Blimp&quot; or simply &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot;. The original cut was 163 minutes. It was reduced to a 150-minute version, then later to 90 minutes for television, both in black and white. One of the crucial changes made to the shortened versions was the removal of the film&#x27;s flashback structure.

==Restorations==
In 1983, the original cut was restored for a re-release, much to Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s delight. Pressburger, as affirmed by his grandson Kevin Macdonald on a Carlton Region 2 DVD featurette, considered &quot;Blimp&quot; the best of his and Powell&#x27;s works.

Nearly 30 years later, &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; underwent another restoration similar to that performed on &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. The fundraising was spearheaded by Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese&#x27;s long-time editor and Michael Powell&#x27;s widow. Restoration work was completed by the Academy Film Archive in association with the BFI, ITV Studios Global Entertainment Ltd. (the current copyright holders), and The Film Foundation, with funding provided by The Material World Charitable Foundation, the Louis B. Mayer Foundation, Cinema per Roma Foundation, and The Film Foundation.

== Reputation ==
Since the highly successful re-release of the film in the 1980s, &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; has been re-evaluated. The film is praised for its dazzling Technicolor cinematography, the performances by the lead actors as well as for transforming, in Roger Ebert&#x27;s words, &quot;a blustering, pigheaded caricature into one of the most loved of all movie characters&quot;. David Mamet has written: &quot;My idea of perfection is Roger Livesey (my favorite actor) in &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (my favorite film) about to fight Anton Walbrook (my other favorite actor).&quot; Stephen Fry saw the film as addressing &quot;what it means to be English&quot;, and praised it for the bravery of taking a &quot;longer view of history&quot; in 1943. Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote in 1995 that the film &quot;may be the greatest English film ever made, not least because it looks so closely at the incurable condition of being English&quot;.

<doc id="960658" wikidata="Q6172775" url="?curid=960658" title="Jedi Prince series">
<text>Jedi Prince is a series of science fiction young-reader novels set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, written by Paul and Hollace Davids. They were published by Bantam Skylark between 1992 and 1993.
The series takes place about a year after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, between the events of the books &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; (1993) and &quot;Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor&quot; (2008).

==Overview==

=== &quot;The Glove of Darth Vader&quot; ===
After the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of the Emperor, the Galactic Empire is left without a true leader. The Supreme Prophet Kadann has prophesied that the next leader of the Empire would wear the indestructible right hand glove of Darth Vader, so Imperial senator Timothy Barclay sends Captain Dunwell to find the glove. The Rebel Alliance and the Senate&#x27;s Planetary Intelligence Network, hoping to find information on the new emperor, send C-3PO and R2-D2 to the planet Kessel. There they discover Grand Moff Hissa introducing Trioculus, who claims to be Palpatine&#x27;s son, as the heir to the Empire. Although he manages to trick his followers by seemingly producing Force lightning, he demands that his advisors find the glove so he can cement his power. After much searching and no clues on the glove&#x27;s whereabouts, Captain Dunwell, the head of the Whaladon Processing Center on Mon Calamari, contacts him to inform him that he has found the glove, deep underneath the ocean. By chance, Luke Skywalker and Admiral Ackbar, after picking up the droids from Kessel, bring them to Mon Calamari to download the information that R2-D2 found. Although the whaling ship is destroyed and Captain Dunwell killed, Luke is unable to stop Trioculus from obtaining the glove and becoming the new emperor. As he parts ways with Luke, Trioculus swears he will destroy him.

=== &quot;The Lost City of the Jedi&quot; ===
After an attempted assassination by the Empire trying to blow up Luke&#x27;s X-wing fighter, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan tells Luke of the secret Lost City of the Jedi hidden beneath the rainforests of Yavin 4. Unknown to Luke at the time, the city is home to a 12-year-old boy named Ken, who is called the &quot;Jedi Prince&quot;. In the city, with the vast databanks on the computers, Ken learns the history of the Jedi and the Rebellion from his only companions, his caretaker droids. As Luke is searching the forests he meets a mysterious healer, Baji. With Baji, he searches the forests, eventually encountering Ken, who had run away from the droids. Before he is questioned further, his caretaker droid Dee-Jay finds him and helps him vanish in a puff of smoke. Luke, more determined to find this city, returns to get help from the rest of the Rebels.

Meanwhile, Emperor Trioculus has a meeting with Supreme Prophet Kadann. Kadann tells him that he is not the true son of Palpatine, but still gives him the blessing of the Prophets. He also tells him of the Lost City of the Jedi, where the Jedi Prince lives, saying that this prince could end Trioculus&#x27; reign. Able to infiltrate the Rebel&#x27;s meeting with an explosive device, he demands that they reveal to him the location of the city. When they refuse, he readies the device&#x27;s explosion, while still taking in the beauty of Princess Leia. As Luke stops the explosion, Trioculus starts his second plan: to raze the forests in order to find the entrance. During this implementation, he suddenly goes blind and orders the capture of the healer, Baji. Baji tells him that when he uses the power of Vader&#x27;s glove, he is injuring his nerve endings, causing blindness and his body to rot. Baji tells him of a cure, but it can only be found in his hut, which is about to be destroyed by the fires. Unable to stop his troops, Trioculus rushes into the hut, and saves the cure, but is badly burned and scarred. As the Rebels attempt to stop the troops, Luke finally finds the city. With the help of the droids at the weather-controlling center, he creates a rainstorm to put an end to the fires. Ken decides to leave with Luke and join the Rebels in their fight leaving the city and his caretakers. Without finding the city, Trioculus leaves the planet, vowing to destroy all of the Rebels except Leia, whom he would make his queen.

=== &quot;Zorba the Hutt&#x27;s Revenge&quot; ===
In order to help Ken become accustomed to the world outside of the Lost City of the Jedi, Luke brings him to Tatooine to experience the &quot;Droidfest.&quot; Although they are attacked by Tusken Raiders and bounty hunters hoping to get the reward Trioculus set for Ken, they manage to escape to Bespin with Han Solo&#x27;s housewarming gift, a housekeeping droid named Kate. Meanwhile, Zorba the Hutt, the father of Jabba, upon learning of his son&#x27;s death, flies to Cloud City in order to claim Jabba&#x27;s casino. Although the governor, Lando Calrissian, who has taken over the casino, refuses the claim, he agrees to bet the city and the casino on a game of sabacc. With Zorba marking the cards in an ultraviolet paint that only Hutts can see, Lando lost the city and left after warning Han and Leia.

After a series of mishaps, Leia is captured by Trioculus&#x27;s guards and brought to his factory on the planet and Ken is captured by Zorba. When Zorba learns that his son&#x27;s murderer is in the custody of Trioculus he proposes a trade. Trioculus, however, won&#x27;t give up his queen, and although has his stormtroopers ready to aid him, is defeated by Zorba&#x27;s police force. Ken, however, is able to escape his jailers through a use of a Jedi mind trick and is reunited with Han. Luke is also able to rescue Leia and all are taken aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; before Zorba destroys Trioculus&#x27;s factory. Thinking that Leia was killed, he taunts Trioculus before freezing him in carbonite. The rebels leave the planet with Han wondering if he&#x27;ll ever be able to ask Leia to marry him.

=== &quot;Mission from Mount Yoda&quot; ===
With Trioculus imprisoned in carbonite, the Prophets meet in Kadann&#x27;s Chamber of Dark Visions to hear his new prophecy on the leadership of the Empire. Kadann spoke in quatrains, prophesying that Trioculus would never again get the blessing to be leader, the new leader is on Duro and finally about the last days of the Rebel Alliance. As the Prophets concoct a plan to retrieve Trioculus&#x27;s body and destroy it, Luke, Leia and Han fly to Dagobah. The rebels began to colonize Dagobah by building a school, which Ken is to attend, and a fortress that served as the Defense Research and Planetary Assistance Center, DRAPAC. DRAPAC was based on Mount Yoda, and was the subject of Kadann&#x27;s prophecy.

While there, a Duros, Dustini, brings news that the planet Duro is under attack by Imperial stormtroopers, who are stealing artifacts. Though he managed to save some, one was a golden crown that was booby trapped and stabbed Dustini, seemingly fulfilling the prophecy. As the Rebels send a mission to Duro to stop the Empire, the Prophets destroy the block of carbonite, only to discover it was fake and Trioculus was still alive. In a secret cavern on Duro, Luke, Han and Ken finally encounter Triclops, the true son of Palpatine. Though the Imperials attacked trying to abduct Triclops, with his help the rebels escaped and brought Triclops back to DRAPAC, with him promising to bring down his father&#x27;s Empire.

=== &quot;Queen of the Empire&quot; ===
When a demonstration of a &quot;decoy&quot; Human Replica Droid of Leia goes wrong and the droid shoots a scientist, Han and Leia are forced to fly him to his home planet of Chad to get treatment. When they reach the planet&#x27;s hospital a hurricane is ravaging it. After Han is able to bring the scientist to the doctors, he is trapped by falling rubble caused by the storm. When Leia eventually saves him, he reveals that the experience scared him that he would not be able to reveal his big plans. Upon leaving the scientist in the doctors&#x27; care, Han proposes to Leia and they plan on eloping at Hologram Fun World, an amusement park. With the help of the new owner of the park, Lando Calrissian, they plan a wedding and visit many hologram attractions, including a trip through the Alderaan of Leia&#x27;s memories.

While they are at the park, one of Zorba the Hutt&#x27;s spies in the park tells him that Leia is alive and he plans on capturing her and killing her on Tatooine as she did to his son. With some help, he manages to capture her during a magic show and take her to his ship, with the carbonite-frozen body of Trioculus, for the trip to Tatooine. Zorba&#x27;s ship, however, is captured by the Moffship of Grand Moff Hissa. When they discover Trioculus is still alive, he is quickly unfrozen and only spares Zorba&#x27;s life when Zorba reveals where Leia is. Hoping to turn Leia to his side, Trioculus drops Zorba into the Pit of Carkoon into the mouth of the Sarlacc. While Trioculus makes plans to marry Leia, Han and Lando, joined by Luke, Ken and the Human Replica Droid of Leia are able to infiltrate the Moffship and plan a rescue operation. They rescue Leia and are able to replace her with the Human Replica Droid, who goes to the wedding in Leia&#x27;s place. While the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; escapes, the droid&#x27;s lasers pierce Trioculus&#x27;s heart. As he lay dying, unbeknownst to anyone, Zorba crawled out of the Sarlacc, as no creature in the universe can digest a Hutt.

=== &quot;Prophets of the Dark Side&quot; ===
As Trioculus lay dying he made Grand Moff Hissa promise that he would make Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebels pay for killing him. Meanwhile, at the Rebel base, they realize that Triclops, while sleepwalking, goes through files at the base and transmits them, through an implant on his tooth, to Imperial probe droids which are evading defenses. Leia proposes that a defense probe be built from plans found at the Lost City of the Jedi. These plans happen to be from Ken&#x27;s homework assignments, prompting him and Luke to return to the city. While there, Ken&#x27;s caretaker Dee-Jay and the other droids tell them about a decoy transport to the city that now leads to an underground sea of lava and also warn them of a prophecy by Supreme Prophet Kadann.

While they return to the Rebel base on Yavin, Zorba the Hutt has a meeting with the Prophets of the Dark Side in their space station Scardia. He tells of the grand moffs betrayals and plans of making Trioculus leader once again. When the Moffship is captured, they are put to trial, and surprised to see Zorba as the main witness. All of the moffs are sentenced to certain death, with Hissa&#x27;s being the cruelest, as the loyalest supporter of Trioculus.

Back on Yavin 4, Luke decides to give Triclops false information about the decoy transporter. In order to stop the information leak altogether, Luke, Ken, and Chewbacca went to the planet Arzid to find a mushroom to deactivate the implant. While there they are captured by Imperial stormtroopers and brought to the Prophets. Kadann, using the false information from Triclops, sends Hissa to his death in the decoy transport and threatens that he will send Luke if Ken doesn&#x27;t betray the location of the real transport. He also promises Ken that he will reveal who his father was. With that motivation, Ken betrays the city and is brought with the Prophets to it. There Kadann reveals that Ken&#x27;s father is Triclops, meaning that the Emperor was his grandfather. Not wanting to believe them and crying, Ken is told that he will be bred to be the new Emperor and will know the dark side of the Force. Meanwhile, Luke, finally able to get free of his guards and rescued by Han and the others, is able to sneak into the city through a steam vent. He rescues Ken, but not before the city is shut down by the Imperials and an earthquake destroys the main computer. Although Luke and Ken are able to reach the surface, Kadann and the other prophets are trapped in the city. Ken is able to come to terms with his parentage, but is unable to speak to his father about it, as Triclops manages to escape and evade capture in the forests of Yavin. The story ends with Leia, preparing for her wedding and seeing a vision of Han with their two children, wondering if they are twins.

==Characters==
* Ken, the main protagonist, is a brave but callow youth, whose behavior resembles that of Luke Skywalker before his Jedi training. Raised in the Lost City of the Jedi for the first twelve years of his life, Ken eventually joins the Rebel Alliance, where Luke discovers him. Ken is the son of the mutant Triclops and, therefore, Emperor Palpatine&#x27;s grandson.
* Trioculus is the self-proclaimed son and heir of Palpatine. As his moniker implies, he has three eyes: two in the same place as a normal human and a third on his forehead. He attempts to procure the glove worn on the hand that Darth Vader lost in his duel with Luke Skywalker in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. This glove is rumored to bestow great power upon its holder. Trioculus is killed by a droid replica of Princess Leia.
* Triclops is Palpatine&#x27;s illegitimate son, named because of his three eyes. He is sent into solitary exile because the Emperor fears Triclops&#x27; potential mastery of the dark side of the Force. During his exile, The Empire administers shock treatment therapies which eventually drove the boy insane, and he is sent to an insane asylum. There, he meets the nurse Kendalina, a Jedi Princess, and the two conceive a child. Kendalina is murdered, and their son, Ken, is taken away. Triclops is forced to work for the slave lord Trioculus. After pledging pacifism and his desire to see the Empire&#x27;s demise, Triclops is taken in by the Alliance. When they learn he was fitted with an implant that transmits images to Imperial Probe droids, they feed him disinformation. Triclops escapes before they can destroy the implant, leaving only an impassioned letter to his son, Ken.
* Grand Moff Hissa is an Imperial Moff who plots to take over the reins of the empire by using Trioculus as a puppet dictator. He loses his legs during a scuffle with the Rebellion, in which he falls into a vat of acid; thereafter, he uses a hovering wheelchair to get around.
* Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side Kadann is a bearded dwarf who prophesies that the next Emperor would wear the glove of Darth Vader, hence Trioculus&#x27;s interest in it. Part of Kadann&#x27;s success as a prophet is due to a network of bribe-payers and other people who help his prophecies come true. In the &quot;Dark Side Sourcebook&quot;, it is revealed that this Kadann was once a Jedi who was secretly turned to the dark side before the Great Jedi Purge. He pledged his loyalty to Palpatine, and was thus spared and became one of his chief advisors. Kadann foresees the Emperor&#x27;s death at Endor and tries to warn him; this warning went disregarded, of course.

==Reception==
&quot;GameRant&quot; said the &quot;books are rife with bizarre plot threads&quot; and &quot;the series comes off as a teenaged Dungeons &amp; Dragons player writing a Star Wars fan fiction.&quot; &quot;Gizmodo&quot; called the series &quot;bad&quot; and listed it among the 12 worst things in the Expanded Universe.

<doc id="960659" wikidata="Q300605" url="?curid=960659" title="A Trick of the Tail">
<text>A Trick of the Tail is the seventh studio album by English progressive rock band Genesis. It was released on 13 February 1976 on Charisma Records and was the first album to feature drummer Phil Collins as lead vocalist following the departure of Peter Gabriel. It was a critical and commercial success in the UK and U.S., reaching No. 3 and No. 31 respectively.

Following Gabriel&#x27;s decision to leave the band, the remaining members wanted to carry on to show they could still write and record successful material, as keyboardist Tony Banks and bassist/rhythm guitarist Mike Rutherford, not Gabriel, were the principal writers of the music. The group wrote and rehearsed new songs during mid-1975, and listened to numerous audition tapes for a replacement frontman. They entered Trident Studios in October with producer David Hentschel to record the album without a definitive idea of who was going to perform lead vocals. After the search for a singer proved unfruitful, Collins was persuaded to sing &quot;Squonk&quot;, and the performance was so strong, he sang lead on the rest of the album.

Upon release, critics were impressed by the improved sound quality and the group&#x27;s ability to survive the loss of Gabriel without sacrificing the quality of the music. The group went out on tour with Collins as frontman and Bill Bruford as tour drummer, and the resulting performances in the US raised Genesis&#x27; profile there. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including a deluxe package with bonus videos in 2007.

== Background ==
Founding member and lead singer Peter Gabriel decided to leave Genesis in late 1974, early in the tour for the album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. His bandmates hoped he would reconsider, as they were still in debt and felt his departure could destroy the band&#x27;s future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members wanted to continue to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.

Following the end of the tour, guitarist Steve Hackett recorded a solo album, &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot; with guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford and drummer Phil Collins, feeling unsure that Genesis would survive. He reconvened with the remaining group members in July 1975. Banks and Rutherford were particularly keen to write and record new material so that critics and fans would accept Gabriel&#x27;s departure. The group began rehearsals in a basement studio in Acton, and quickly wrote material they were happy with, but had not yet found a replacement lead singer. They placed an anonymous advertisement in the music paper &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for &quot;a singer for a Genesis-type group&quot;, which received around 400 replies. Some applicants sent photographs of themselves in costume and wearing masks, as Gabriel had done on stage. A few weeks into rehearsals, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; managed to find out about Gabriel leaving the band, and their story made the front page of the 16 August issue, where journalist Chris Welch declared Genesis dead. The group spoke to the music papers to deny they were splitting up and explained they had a new album written and waiting to be recorded.

== Recording ==

Recording began in Trident Studios in October 1975 with producer David Hentschel. On previous Genesis albums Hentschel had served as tape op and (later) as engineer; Collins had become a fan of his album &quot;Startling Music&quot;, a re-recording of Ringo Starr&#x27;s album &quot;Ringo&quot; on an ARP 2500 synthesizer. Collins thought the group could carry on as an instrumental act, but the others felt that it would be boring without vocals. The group had still not decided on a replacement singer, so they decided to start recording backing tracks and audition singers as they went. Gabriel visited the band in the studio and listened to the album, and thought they had succeeded in proving to others that they still were &quot;a whole, strong band without me&quot;. He knew that the group could write strong material, but the little effort it took them surprised him the most.

Some songs such as &quot;Ripples...&quot; were written with the intention that Collins could sing them, similar to &quot;More Fool Me&quot; on &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;, but he did not want to take over as a permanent replacement, opting instead to teach potential lead singers the songs. The group still wanted a regular frontman for live performances, as they thought Collins would not be able to handle all the material, and it would be problematic trying to sing Gabriel&#x27;s vocal parts while drumming on tour. One of the auditionees, Mick Strickland, was invited into the studio to sing, but the backing tracks were in a key outside of his natural range and the band decided not to work with him. With the band&#x27;s recruitment efforts having failed to produce a suitable vocalist, Collins reluctantly went in the studio to sing &quot;Squonk&quot;. His performance was well received by the band, and they decided that he should be their new lead singer. Hentschel stayed on as co-producer for future Genesis albums up to 1980&#x27;s &quot;Duke&quot;.

== Songs ==
The opening track, &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot;, was the first song written for the album. Rutherford felt that, in contrast to the material on &quot;The Lamb...&quot;, it was easy to write, and was intended to show how Genesis would move forward.

&quot;Entangled&quot; originated from a piece by Hackett that Banks particularly liked, and the latter went on to write the chorus and closing synthesiser solo for the song. Hackett also wrote the lyrics which Collins thought had a &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; feel to them. Rutherford recalled that Hackett &quot;started writing verses which were very airy-fairy and then he came down with a bang&quot;.

&quot;Squonk&quot; is based on the North American tale of the Squonk which, when captured, dissolves in a pool of tears. The song combines a main theme written by Rutherford against a middle section written by Banks, and was designed to sound like Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot;.

&quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot; was mostly written by Banks, in an attempt to replicate the humour in some of Gabriel&#x27;s lyrics. Collins, who also contributed to the writing, sang the song in character, inspired by his earlier role as the Artful Dodger in &quot;Oliver!&quot; before he became a professional musician.

&quot;Ripples...&quot; was a combination of a 12-string guitar piece composed by Rutherford and a piano-led middle section written by Banks.

Banks&#x27;s track &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; took form as a song some years before the band recorded it. He was inspired from reading the novel &quot;The Inheritors&quot; by William Golding and &quot;Getting Better&quot; by the Beatles, and wrote about an alien visiting Earth. When it came to selecting tracks for the album, he wanted to include &quot;something lighter and more quirky&quot;.

The closing song, &quot;Los Endos&quot;, was written by the whole band. Collins came up with the basic rhythmic structure, inspired by his work in side project Brand X and &quot;Promise of a Fisherman&quot; by Santana, wanting to take the looser playing style into Genesis. Banks and Hackett wrote the main themes, including reprises of &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; and &quot;Squonk&quot;, and Collins sang a few lines from &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; (on the 1972 album &quot;Foxtrot&quot;) on the fade-out, as a tribute and final goodbye to Gabriel. The opening section of &quot;Los Endos&quot; was recorded for a completely different song, &quot;It&#x27;s Yourself&quot;, which was later released as a B-side. &quot;Los Endos&quot; became a live favourite, and continued to be played through to the 2007 &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; tour. In 2014, Hackett added the song to the playlist of his extended &quot;Genesis Revisited II&quot; tour.

== Reception ==
&quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; had a positive reception from music critics, who were impressed that the group could not only survive the loss of Gabriel but still deliver a good album. The sound quality had improved from previous albums as a result of Hentschel&#x27;s production skills. The album reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 31 in the U.S. It was certified Gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry in June and in the US by the RIAA in March 1990. The album remained in the UK charts for 39 weeks and recouped a significant amount of the $400,000 worth of debt they had accumulated by the time Gabriel left.

For the first time in their career, Genesis filmed promotional videos for their songs. The first to be filmed was the title track, which features the band playing to the song together around a piano, including composite shots of a miniature Collins hopping around on a piano and a guitar. The group also produced promotional films of &quot;Ripples...&quot; and &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot;.

== Tour ==

Even after the album had been completed, Collins was unhappy about leaving the drumkit to sing lead, and the band were unsure he would be comfortable as frontman on tour. The group decided to try anyway, and needed someone to drum while Collins was singing. Collins insisted on choosing the touring drummer himself, selecting Bill Bruford, with whom he had already worked in Brand X. Collins continued to drum during instrumental sections.

The new line-up rehearsed in Dallas for a North American tour, which began in London, Ontario. Collins was nervous about what to say to the audience between songs, so Rutherford and Hackett helped with some announcements. Unlike Gabriel&#x27;s theatrical approach, Collins developed a humorous rapport with the audience, and it was immediately successful. Audiences were happy to hear Collins sing old material such as &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; in concert, and the resulting tour raised Genesis&#x27; profile in the U.S., where they had been relatively unknown while Gabriel was in the band.

== Track listing ==
This is the first Genesis album to credit songwriters individually, as opposed to the band as a whole.

=== 2007 SACD/CD/DVD release ===
A new version of &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; was released in the UK/Europe/Japan by Virgin/EMI &amp; in the US by Atlantic/Rhino in 2007 as part of the &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; box set. This includes the entire album in remixed stereo, surround sound, and related video tracks. A further DVD release includes audio and video tracks, including an interview with the band, the promotional videos, and the film &quot;&quot;, filmed during the 1976 tour promoting the album.
