<text>&quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; is a comedy song written by Monty Python member Eric Idle that was first featured in the Python film &quot;Life of Brian&quot; and has gone on to become a common singalong at public events such as football matches as well as funerals.

Written in the British music hall tradition, the song touches on stoicism and the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; spirit in the face of adversity, so often associated with British people. It became immensely popular, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart in 1991. Idle performed the song live to a global audience at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony during the one-hour symphony of British Music segment.

==History==
Whilst trying to come up with a way of ending the film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, Eric Idle wrote an original version of the song on a Gibson J-50 guitar using only jazz chords he learnt from a course by Mickey Baker. Originally the song was sung in a more straight fashion, which the other Python members eventually agreed would be good enough for the end of the film. However, Michael Palin noted in his diary for 16 June 1978 that during a script meeting, &quot;Eric&#x27;s two songs—&#x27;Otto&#x27; and the &#x27;Look on the Bright Side&#x27; crucifixion song—are rather coolly received before lunch.&quot; Despite being initially underwhelmed, the group warmed to Idle&#x27;s efforts and the song was retained. While practising during a break in filming, Idle found that it worked better if sung in a more cheeky manner by a character of his called &quot;Mr Cheeky&quot;, which in turn was based on the film&#x27;s Cockney lighting crew. This new version was used in the film and became one of Monty Python&#x27;s most famous compositions.

The song appears at the end of the film. The film&#x27;s lead character Brian Cohen (played by Graham Chapman) has been crucified for his part in a kidnap plot. After a succession of apparent rescue opportunities all come to nothing, a character on a nearby cross (played by Eric Idle) attempts to cheer him up by singing &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;. As the song progresses, many of the other crucifixion victims (140 in all, according to the script, though twenty-three crosses are actually seen on screen) begin to dance in a very restricted way and join in with the song&#x27;s whistled hook. The song continues as the scene changes to a long-shot of the crosses and the credits begin to roll. An instrumental version plays over the second half of the credits. Its appearance at the end of the film, when the central character seems certain to die, is deliberately ironic.

&quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; was arranged and conducted by John Altman and recorded at Chappell&#x27;s Studio with a full orchestra and the Fred Tomlinson Singers. The whistling was performed by Neil Innes. The song appeared on the film soundtrack album, listed as &quot;Look on the Bright Side of Life (All Things Dull and Ugly)&quot;. The subtitle does not appear in the actual song, and is only used on the soundtrack album. &quot;All Things Dull and Ugly&quot; was also the title of an unrelated track on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot; (released the following year) which is a parody of the popular hymn &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot;. The song was also released as a Double A side single with &quot;Brian&quot;, the film&#x27;s opening theme (performed by Sonia Jones).

The song touched a chord with the British trait of stoicism and the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; in the face of disaster, and became immensely popular. When the destroyer HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; was struck by an Exocet anti-ship missile on 4 May 1982 in the Falklands War, her crew sang it while waiting to be rescued from their sinking ship, as did the crew of HMS &quot;Coventry&quot;.

When Chapman died on 4 October 1989, the five remaining Pythons, as well as Chapman&#x27;s close friends and family, came together at his public memorial service to sing &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; as part of Idle&#x27;s eulogy. In 2005, a survey by Music Choice showed that it was the third-most popular song Britons would like played at their funerals. By 2014, it was the most popular.

==Alternative lyrics==
When performing the song live in a (solo) sketch within special events, Idle re-wrote one verse of the song to fit the particular occasion, and on one occasion sung a parody of the song with entirely different lyrics. What follows are two such examples of the former, and the latter.

=== &quot;We Are Most Amused&quot; version (Prince Charles&#x27;s 60th birthday party, 2008) ===

&quot;If Spamalot is hot&lt;br&gt;
And you like it, or per&#x27;aps not&lt;br&gt;
A bunch of knights in search of Holy Grails;&lt;br&gt;
When you&#x27;re 60 years of age&lt;br&gt;
And your mum won&#x27;t leave the stage,&lt;br&gt;
It&#x27;s good to know that you&#x27;re still Prince of Wales!&quot;

=== 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony version ===

&quot;When you&#x27;re stuck on the world&#x27;s stage&lt;br&gt;
With lots of loonies half your age,&lt;br&gt; 
And everything is starting to go wrong,&lt;br&gt; 
It’s too late to run away,&lt;br&gt; 
You might as well just stay,&lt;br&gt; 
Especially when they play your silly song!&quot;

=== Duet with James Corden ===
In 2018, Idle made a guest appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;; he and Corden begin to perform a duet of the song to distract from the abundance of bad-natured current events, but after they are interrupted multiple times by notifications on their cell phones where they are aghast at even more upsetting news, they instead sing a parody of the song titled &quot;We Are Probably All Going to Die&quot;, which ends with a reprise of the original song&#x27;s chorus.

==Single==
&quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; was first issued as a single as a double A-side with &quot;Brian&quot; in the UK on 16 November 1979 to promote &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; and its soundtrack album, but did not chart. Nine years later when the film was released on VHS, the song was reissued on 21 November 1988 in an edited form to remove profanity, with a full version of &quot;Brian&quot; on the B-side. Once again it failed to chart.

The song became particularly popular in the early 1990s. The film had retained a cult status in the intervening years. Around 1990, BBC Radio 1 DJ Simon Mayo, whose breakfast show had a track record of reviving old novelty songs, began playing the original version on his show, which led to Virgin reissuing the track as a single on 23 September 1991.

The 7-inch single was backed with two tracks from &quot;Contractual Obligation&quot;, &quot;I Bet You They Won&#x27;t Play This Song on the Radio&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Worried&quot;, while the cassette and CD singles added a German-language version of &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; taken from the first &quot;Fliegender Zirkus&quot; episode. The single reached the top ten in October and prompted a deliberately chaotic performance by Idle on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Despite some predictions, it did not manage to bring an end to Bryan Adams&#x27;s unprecedented run at the top of the UK Singles Chart with &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, instead peaking at number 3 and leading to a re-promotion for the 1989 compilation &quot;Monty Python Sings&quot;, which the song opens. However, the single did get to Number 1 in Ireland on 13 October 1991, despite &quot;Life of Brian&quot; having been banned in Ireland, and the soundtrack on Warners withdrawn when released after protests. Following this attention, the song became more popular than ever. Two cover versions, by Tenor Fly (incorporating the piano riff from Nina Simone&#x27;s &quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me&quot;), and the cast of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (with main vocals by Bill Waddington, who played Percy Sugden in the show), both reached the charts in 1995, with &quot;The Coronation Street Single&quot; version reaching number 35.

Eric Idle recorded alternative lyrics for the radio version, with the swearing censored, and the comments about the end of the film replaced with references to &quot;the end of the record&quot;, and continued rants about old people. This version was released on CD, cassette and vinyl via the compilation album &quot;Now 20&quot; in November 1991 and as a b-side on a reissue of &quot;Galaxy Song&quot; (where it is billed as &quot;1991 version&quot;) on 2 December 1991. For this radio version, the line &quot;Life&#x27;s a piece of shit&quot; was altered to &quot;Life&#x27;s a piece of spit&quot;. In recognition of Simon Mayo&#x27;s contribution to making the record a hit, a special version was also created, in which Idle addresses him by name. Mayo still uses this version when the song is played on his show. This version is also included as the penultimate track on &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 1991 – The Millennium Series&quot;, released in 1999.

On 14 July 2014 another version of the song was issued, this time as a 12&quot; single where it was promoted as &quot;The Unofficial England Football Anthem&quot;. The track featured a new vocal from Eric Idle and some alternate lyrics about the World Cup.

== Covers ==
Harry Nilsson performed &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; as the closing track on his 1980 album, &quot;Flash Harry&quot;. In 1997, the song was recorded by Art Garfunkel and included in the soundtrack of James L. Brooks&#x27; film &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;. In the film itself, Jack Nicholson sings the song fleetingly with the minor addition of &quot;your&quot; in &quot;brighter side of [your] life&quot;. Garfunkel&#x27;s version replaced the risqué phrase &quot;Life&#x27;s a piece of shit&quot; with the more family-friendly &quot;Life&#x27;s a counterfeit&quot; (&quot;Life is hit or miss&quot; has also replaced the lyric as with wedding bands and live radio). The song has also been performed by Bruce Cockburn and released on his 1990 live CD.

The Brobdingnagian Bards recorded the song for their CD &quot;A Faire to Remember&quot;. American musician Emilie Autumn performed a harpsichord cover of the song for her compilation album &quot;A Bit o&#x27; This &amp; That&quot;. Heavens Gate recorded a metal cover of &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; for the album &quot;Hell for Sale!&quot;. Green Day has used it in their rendition of &quot;Shout&quot; on their concert DVD &quot;Bullet in a Bible&quot;.

German fun metal band JBO made a version of the song with changed lyrics (&quot;Always Look on the Dark Side of Life&quot;) for their album &quot;Sex Sex Sex&quot;. German fun punk band Heiter bis Wolkig also made a version with changed lyrics called &quot;Versuch&#x27;s mal von der breiten Seite zu seh&#x27;n&quot;. The British duo Amateur Transplants made a parody version of &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; as well, with lyrics in which only the name and the chorus of the original song are retained.

Green Day did a short version of the song on their &quot;Revolution Radio&quot; tour in 2017 in Brisbane, Australia. They also covered &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; after playing &quot;King for a Day&quot; and &quot;Shout&quot;.

Scooter used a shortened version, also titled &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;, on their &quot;Scooter Forever&quot; album (2017), giving the song a techno version.

==Other appearances==
The song appears twice in the Broadway musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;, based on &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; – once in Act II and again during the curtain call.

The song is used at the end of &quot;Not the Messiah (He&#x27;s a Very Naughty Boy)&quot;, the comedic oratorio written by Eric Idle and collaborator John Du Prez.

The metal band Iron Maiden are known to play the song at the end of their concerts.

The song would make an appearance on season 8 of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, where Idle sung it as his encore song after being unmasked as the Hedgehog.

<text>Igor II Olgovich (died September 19, 1147) was Prince of Chernigov and Grand Prince of Kiev (1146). He was a son of Oleg I of Chernigov.

He was the chosen successor of his brother, Vsevolod II of Kiev. Though his brother had extracted promises of loyalty from his Kievan subjects, Igor and his family, the Olgovichi, were unpopular and there was resistance against his accession. The chroniclers accused Igor of being dishonest, greedy, scheming, and violent. He had reigned less than two weeks before the Kievans invited his cousin and rival, Iziaslav II, to be their prince. Reneging on a promise he had made not to seek power, Iziaslav attacked and defeated Igor and his brother Sviatoslav.

Sviatoslav escaped, but Igor got bogged down in some marshes and was unable to flee because of an infirmity in his legs. He was captured, and Iziaslav had him thrown into a pit. He languished in the pit until autumn 1146, when, desperately ill, he requested permission to become a monk. Iziaslav released him, but Igor was so weak he had to be carried from the pit and nearly died of illness. He became a monk at the monastery of St. Feodor in Kiev under the name Ignati.

In 1147, a mob attacked Igor under the mistaken impression that he intended to usurp Iziaslav&#x27;s throne. Iziaslav&#x27;s brother, Vladimir, tried to rescue Igor, but the mob tore down a balcony on which Igor had sought sanctuary, and thus killed him. His body was dragged behind a cart and exhibited in a market before it could be salvaged by Vladimir. Miracles were alleged to have occurred around Igor&#x27;s body, and he was proclaimed a saint-martyr. Eventually his remains were sent to the Transfiguration Cathedral in Chernigov.

== Veneration ==
Igor is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day being on 19 September. He bears the saint titles of &quot;Right-Believing and &quot;Martyr&quot;

<text>Theresa Ione Sanderson (born 14 March 1956) is a British former javelin thrower. She appeared in every Summer Olympics from 1976 to 1996, winning the gold medal in the javelin throw at the 1984 Olympics. She was the second track and field athlete to compete at six Olympics, and the first Black British woman to win an Olympic gold medal.

Sanderson won gold medals in the javelin throw at three Commonwealth Games (1978, 1986 and 1990) and at the 1992 IAAF World Cup. She was runner-up at the 1978 European Athletics Championships, and competed in three world championships (1983, 1987, and 1997). Sanderson was UK National Champion three times and AAA National Champion in amateur athletics ten times. She set five Commonwealth records and ten British national records in the javelin, as well as records at the junior and masters levels. During her career, Sanderson had a rivalry with fellow Briton Fatima Whitbread, who took the bronze in the 1984 Olympics.

Outside athletics, Sanderson has made several guest television appearances, and was a sports reporter for Sky News when it began broadcasting in 1989. Sanderson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1985 and became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2004 New Years Honours. She was Vice-chair of Sport England from 1999 to 2005, and later established the Tessa Sanderson Foundation and Academy, which aims to encourage young people and people with disabilities to take up sport.

==Early life==

Theresa Ione Sanderson was born on 14 March 1956 in St Elizabeth, Colony of Jamaica. Her parents left Jamaica to find work in England when Sanderson was five. She was cared for by her grandmother until she went to live with her parents in Wednesfield (then in Staffordshire) at age six. Barbara Richards, her physical education teacher at Ward&#x27;s Bridge High School, noted her talent for athletics and encouraged her to succeed; Richards threatened to place Sanderson in after-school detention if she did not train, an approach which Sanderson later said helped. She first threw a javelin at age 14, betting with a friend for a bag of chips on who would be able to throw it further.

==Athletic career==

===Early career===

Sanderson was a member of Wolverhampton &amp; Bilston Athletics Club, competing in the javelin throw and multi-event disciplines. In 1972, aged 16, Sanderson won the Intermediate javelin event at the English Schools&#x27; Athletics Championships. She was selected to compete in the javelin throw at the 1973 European Athletics Junior Championships the following year, where she reached the final but finished 12th with a throw of well behind the winner, Tonya Khristova of Bulgaria, who threw . Sanderson then decided to focus on the javelin throw rather than the pentathlon, partly because she thought that javelin competitions would provide more opportunities for travel. She made her senior international debut in the javelin throw at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, finishing fifth. Later that year, Sanderson finished 13th in the 1974 European Athletics Championships. She broke the British javelin-throw junior record five times, achieving a distance of in 1974. Sanderson set the national record in 1976, throwing , and went on to set ten national records and five Commonwealth records.

The 1976 season saw Sanderson&#x27;s debut at the Olympics. Aged 20, she was the youngest competitor in her event and threw to finish ninth. In July 1977, at the European Cup semi-finals in Dublin, she threw a national record and the second-longest distance by a woman at the time. At the European Cup finals, Ruth Fuchs of East Germany won the gold and Sanderson took the silver. Later that year, Sanderson was the bronze medalist at the 1977 IAAF World Cup.

Sanderson won her first major gold medal with a throw of in the 1978 Commonwealth Games, the first time England had won Commonwealth gold in the women&#x27;s javelin since 1962. A few weeks later, Sanderson took silver at the 1978 European Athletics Championships behind Fuchs; she was the bronze medalist at the 1979 European Cup again behind Fuchs, both of them losing out to Romanian Éva Ráduly-Zörgő. Selected for the 1980 Summer Olympics, she failed to meet the qualifying standard for the final, reaching only with her first throw and having her other two attempts declared no-throws.

After the 1980 Summer Olympic Games, Sanderson asked Wilf Paish of the Carnegie Institute of Physical Education in Leeds to become her coach, and lived with his family once he agreed. A throw of was enough for Sanderson to win at the 1981 Pacific Conference Games. At the 1981 European Cup, she was runner-up behind Antoaneta Todorova of Bulgaria who made a world-record throw of . She also competed in the pentathlon and heptathlon, setting UK and Commonwealth records for the heptathlon twice in 1981. Later that year, Sanderson had an achilles tendon rupture in her left leg and broke a bone in her throwing arm. Surgery on her Achilles tendon was unsuccessful, and she required another operation; the injuries prevented her from competing for 22 months. After returning, Sanderson achieved her career-best javelin throw of at the Tarmac Games in Edinburgh on 26 June 1983. It was the third-longest throw by a woman at the time, when the record was thrown by Tiina Lillak of Finland ten days previously. Sanderson finished fourth at the 1983 World Championships; another British competitor, Fatima Whitbread, who was coming to the fore as her rival, won silver. After re-injuring her Achilles tendon at the championship, Sanderson had surgery on both Achilles tendons a few days after the competition ended.

===Olympic gold and later career===

Sanderson won the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in the javelin, setting a new Olympic record with her throw of . Whitbread won the bronze; it was Great Britain&#x27;s first Olympic win in a throwing event since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Sanderson is the first Black British woman to win an Olympic gold medal. Sanderson wrote in her 1986 autobiography that following her Olympic victory, she had not intended to compete in the following athletics season, but she did take part in several competitions after being persuaded by her management company IMG to do so. Although she finished behind Whitbread in five successive meetings, Sanderson did produce the fourth-longest women&#x27;s javelin throw of the year. She won gold at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, and Whitbread took the silver medal.

In March 1987, Sanderson announced that she would change her focus from the javelin throw to the heptathlon. Shortly before then, she had moved to London and was looking for a career in television or promotional work. In fact, she only competed in one heptathlon after this, in July. At the Dairy Crest Games in August, Whitbread (who had been undefeated during the season) injured her shoulder; Sanderson won the event. Sanderson then announced that she would train with Mick Hill in Italy for the world championships. Whitbread won the world championship, and Sanderson finished fourth.

About ten days before participating in the 1988 Summer Olympics as defending champion, Sanderson burst the skin around her ankle and exposed her Achilles tendon. She failed to qualify for the final and left the competition limping, with blood visible on the bandage on her injured ankle. Sanderson left the stadium on crutches before the medal ceremony, where Whitbread received the silver medal behind Petra Felke from East Germany.

Sanderson announced after the 1988 Olympics that she would retire from the javelin throw, but made an unexpected return to competition in 1989 at the McVitie&#x27;s International Challenge; she finished third. She also finished third at the 1989 European Cup, despite not being in top condition. At the 1990 Commonwealth Games, a throw of was enough for Sanderson to retain her title. She finished 12th at the 1990 European Athletics Championships, but was later moved up to 11th. Aged 35, Sanderson won at the 1991 European Cup over a field which included world-record holder Felke.

Her fifth Olympic Games appearance, at the 1992 Summer Olympics, set a record for Olympic appearances by a British athlete. Sanderson&#x27;s best throw, , was almost five metres less than the winning throw of by Silke Renk and 3.28 metres less than bronze medalist Karen Forkel. She won gold at the 1992 World Cup with a throw of , nearly three metres further than any other competitor.

===Rivalry with Fatima Whitbread===

Alan Hubbard wrote in a 1990 article in &quot;The Observer&quot; about Sanderson and Whitbread that &quot;their hate-hate relationship has been one of the most enduring in British sport&quot;, lasting almost a decade. The same year, Matthew Engel wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;the Sanderson-Whitbread feud is, of course, one of the most splendid in sport&quot;, and Tom Lamont, in the same newspaper 29 years later, commented that &quot;Whitbread and Sanderson were always uneasy rivals and the enmity that developed during their overlapping careers became as famous as their achievements, and seems to survive in their retirement&quot;. Hubbard cited Sanderson&#x27;s perception that Whitbread received preferential treatment from the British Amateur Athletic Board. The Board&#x27;s promotions officer, Andy Norman, who had a role in setting British athletes&#x27; fees, was a family friend of Whitbread and her mother and coach, Margaret. Margaret Whitbread was also the national coach for women&#x27;s javelin in 1985, when her daughter participated in many international events while Sanderson only competed in one in the season ending in June 1985. In 1987, Sanderson threatened to boycott athletics events, for which she was being paid £1,000 each by British Athletics compared to Whitbread&#x27;s £10,000. Sanderson agreed to a new deal at the beginning of June that year. Sanderson also objected to the endorsement that the Whitbreads had given to the Australian athlete Sue Howland, who competed at the 1990 Commonwealth Games after a two-year doping suspension, saying that she felt that they should have supported British athletes instead.

During their respective careers, Sanderson won an Olympic and three Commonwealth golds, and Whitbread gained one world and one European title. In all, Sanderson placed higher in 27 of the 45 times that they faced each other in competition, although Whitbread had the better results of the pair from 1984 to 1987. In 2019, Sanderson told an interviewer from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that although she had initially been on friendly terms with Whitbread, before &quot;the competition got to Whitbread&#x27;s head&quot; and they fell out, &quot;The rivalry was one of the best things when you look at it now. It drove me to another level. It made me want to beat her every time. It&#x27;s calmer now. I respect her and I hope she respects me.&quot;

=== Return to competition ===

After a four-year hiatus, Sanderson returned to track and field competition in 1996. She set masters (over-40) record throws of and with her first two throws in May, surpassing the previous record of . After two further masters-record throws, Sanderson increased the record to at the Securicor Games in July. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, she became the second track and field athlete (after Romanian discus thrower Lia Manoliu) to compete at six Olympics but did not qualify for the final. Sanderson also failed to qualify for the final at the 1997 World Championships, her last international appearance. Sanderson retired from competition in 1997; Whitbread had retired five years earlier.

During the 1970s, the use of performance-enhancing drugs was common in throwing events; Sanderson spoke against the practice, consistently maintaining an anti-doping stance. Her rival, two-time Olympic champion Fuchs, later admitted using steroids in the East German sports programme. The East German team did not compete in the 1984 Olympic Games as they participated in a wider boycott led by the Soviet Union. Sanderson told reporters from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2021 that she felt during her career she had been &quot;robbed&quot; of medals by losing to competitors using drugs.

==Outside competition==

Sanderson has appeared as a guest on several television shows, including panel games &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; (in 1979), &quot;Bullseye&quot; (1984), &quot;Catchphrase Celebrity Special&quot; (1991), and &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; (2009). When Sky News was launched in 1989, Sanderson was a sports reporter for the channel, and she also co-hosted ITV&#x27;s light-entertainment programme &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; with Cilla Black. In 2012, Sanderson was in &quot;Billy&#x27;s Olympic Nightmare&quot;, a BBC Red Button episode of soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and was a contestant on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice Goes Gold&quot; in the same year. At age 58, she began modelling for the Grey Model Agency.

Sanderson was vice-chair of Sport England from 1999 to 2005. In 2006, she founded an academy in Newham which helped to find and train athletes to represent Britain in the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Tessa Sanderson Foundation and Academy was established in September 2009 to encourage young people and people with disabilities to take up sport with mentoring and support.

From 2009 to 2013, Sanderson organised an annual 10 km race in Newham; part of the route was through Olympic Park. Although the 2013 event attracted 3,000 participants (representing 45 different nationalities), it was cancelled in 2014; Sanderson said that the Newham Council wanted to double its fee, and delayed meeting about the race. Sanderson was appointed to the board of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, chaired by Baroness Ford, to &quot;develop and manage&quot; the park after the 2012 Olympics.

==Honours==

Sanderson, the British Athletics Writers&#x27; Association Athlete of the Year in 1977, 1978 and 1984, was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame in 2012. Candidates for the Hall of Fame are selected by a panel of experts and then voted on by the public. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours after her Olympic gold-medal performance, raised to Officer (OBE) in the 1998 New Year Honours for her charity work, and to Commander (CBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours for her service to Sport England.

Sanderson is an honorary graduate of the University of Wolverhampton, and was made an Honorary Fellow of London South Bank University in 2004. That year, she was one of 100 Great Black Britons in a poll taken after the BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; failed to include any Black Britons. Later that year, Sanderson received a Sportswomen of the Year Lifetime Achievement award from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. A housing estate in Wednesfield near where she began learning the javelin throw was named Sanderson Park after her. Two roads are named after her: Tessa Sanderson Place is near Wandsworth Road in South London, and Tessa Sanderson Way is in Greenford, West London.

==Personal life==

Sanderson has spoken about the discrimination she has experienced as a black woman. She told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1990 that she had faced racial discrimination (although not in her sporting career), and she felt that sexism was the reason women athletes were not adequately paid. Sanderson experienced racist language and behaviour in school (including being spat on), and has spoken about receiving a racist letter saying that she was not truly British after her 1984 Olympic gold medal. She told Sky Sports in October 2020, &quot;Black athletes didn&#x27;t have the voice they have now, so I just had to fight my own battles&quot;, and expressed disappointment at the continuing lack of Black, Asian and minority representation in sports governing bodies.

&quot;Tessa: My Life in Athletics&quot;, Sanderson&#x27;s autobiography, was published in 1986. In 1990, she sued several newspapers and was awarded £30,000 in damages by the High Court of Justice for claims that she had &quot;stolen another woman&#x27;s husband&quot;. Sanderson said that her affair with the man, Derrick Evans (a fitness instructor known as Mr Motivator) began after his marriage had broken up. Sanderson had starred in the fitness videos &quot;Cardiofunk&quot; (1990) and &quot;Body Blitz&quot; (c. 1992) with Evans.

On 3 May 2010, Sanderson married former judo Olympian Densign White at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Her bridesmaids were fellow Olympic teammates Sharron Davies, Kelly Holmes and Christine Ohuruogu. She had three unsuccessful in vitro fertilisation treatments by the age of 50. Sanderson and White began fostering four-month-old twins Cassius and Ruby Mae in 2013 and adopted them the following year, when Sanderson was 58. Her nephew, Dion Sanderson, is a footballer who debuted with Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 2019.

<text>Wollaston is a relatively small lunar impact crater located in the Oceanus Procellarum. To the northwest is the similar Nielsen. To the southeast is the somewhat larger Krieger. There are several small rilles to the southwest of Wollaston, forming part of the Rimae Prinz.

The crater was formally named by the IAU in 1935.

This is a circular, cup-shaped crater with a higher albedo than the surrounding mare. It has a raised rim that is free from impact erosion, and is surrounded by a small radial skirt of ejecta. The crater has not been significantly eroded by subsequent impacts.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Wollaston.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Wollaston C — &quot;See&quot; Nielsen.

<text>Felix Edward Hébert ( ; October 12, 1901 – December 29, 1979) was an American journalist and politician from Louisiana. He represented the New Orleans–based 1st congressional district as a Democrat for 18 consecutive terms, from 1941 until his retirement in 1977. He remains Louisiana&#x27;s longest-serving U.S. representative.

==Early life and education==
Hébert was born in New Orleans to Felix Joseph Hébert, a streetcar conductor, and the former Lea Naquin, a teacher. As a boy he loved sports, but after a shooting accident left him blind in his left eye at the age of nine, he could not play. However, at Jesuit High School he compensated by becoming manager of all the athletic teams. He reported on prep-school sports for &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;, becoming the paper&#x27;s assistant sports editor before he was out of high school, and at Tulane University he was the first sports editor of the &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;.

==Journalism career==
Hébert graduated from Tulane in 1924. He pursued a career in public relations for Loyola University in New Orleans and journalism for the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; and the New Orleans &quot;States&quot;, a paper purchased by &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; while Hébert worked there. As a front-page columnist and political editor, he covered the candidacy and election of Governor Huey Long, who was eventually elected to the United States Senate. &quot;&quot;In 1939, after being promoted to city editor, Mr. Hebert broke the story of political corruption that became known as the &quot;Louisiana scandals,&quot; leading to the jailing of many Long associates and triggering Mr. Hebert&#x27;s political career, reportedly at the urging of former Gov. James A. Noe, who had broken with the Long machine and reportedly supplied the tip that led to the expose.&#x27;&quot;— which put a spotlight on corruption among followers of the Long political family — contributed to the eventual convictions of Governor Richard W. Leche and James Monroe Smith, president of Louisiana State University. &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; won the Sigma Delta Chi plaque for &quot;courage in journalism&quot;, largely as a result of Hébert&#x27;s work.

&quot;As a member of the Armed Services Committee. He joined the states&#x27; rights Dixiecrat revolt in 1948, the only member of the Louisiana delegation to the Democratic National Convention to do so, kindling a feud with President Truman.&quot; In later life, Hébert said he never considered himself a politician. He described himself as &quot;an old reporter on a long sabbatical&quot;. In 1969 he said, &quot;I had no political ambition whatsoever. I never intended to enter public office; I had never been in public office. In this time, it looked to me like a pretty good chance to be a better reporter if I came to Washington. They got me on sabbatical leave for two years because I knew I would never be re-elected.&quot;

==Political career==

Hébert&#x27;s work also led to his election in 1940 to the 77th United States Congress. Hébert served in the United States House of Representatives until the end of the 94th United States Congress, having chosen not to seek a nineteenth term in 1976. That longevity set a Louisiana record for the service in the United States House of Representatives. Hébert was temporarily succeeded by the Democrat Richard Alvin Tonry, who in turn was quickly replaced by Bob Livingston, the first Republican to represent the district since the Reconstruction Era. The seat has remained in Republican hands ever since, passing from Livingston to David Vitter to Bobby Jindal to Steve Scalise.

=== House Committee on Armed Services, 1948–1975 ===
He joined the United States House Committee on Armed Services and was named chairman of the committee&#x27;s Special Investigations subcommittee.

==== Chairmanship, 1971–1975 ====
Hébert was the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services from 1971 to 1975. When Chairman L. Mendel Rivers died, on December 29, 1970, lame duck committee member Philip J. Philbin took his place; Philbin&#x27;s term ran out three and a half days later, and Hébert took the post.

Hébert brought millions of dollars in military investment to his district in Louisiana.

Hébert required Pat Schroeder and Ron Dellums, a female and Black Representative respectively, to share a seat in the committee room; Schroeder recalled him saying, &quot;The two of you are only worth half the normal member.&quot; He refused to approve her appointment to a U.S. delegation heading to an overseas conference, reportedly remarking, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t send you to represent this committee at a dogfight.&quot; The State Department eventually waived the rule requiring the chairman&#x27;s approval of all nominations, and Mrs. Schroeder made the trip.

He was removed from the chairmanship in a revolt of the increasingly young and liberal House Democratic Caucus against the seniority system. Many of the younger Democrats were not pleased when he addressed the new members from the Watergate Class of 1974 as &quot;boys and girls&quot;. Governor Edwin Edwards, New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu and the Louisiana House delegation chided the caucus for ousting Hebert as his years of political experience had generated thousands of jobs and brought millions of dollars into the state.

==Personal life and family==
On August 1, 1934, Hébert married Gladys Bofill. The couple had one daughter, Dawn Marie, who married a future judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, John Malcolm Duhé Jr., of Iberia Parish. Dawn Hébert was the first woman president of the Greater Iberia Chamber of Commerce.

== Illness and death ==
In 1975 he slipped on a piece of ice at a cocktail party and broke his arm. In 1979 he began to suffer congestive heart failure, and he died on December 29 in New Orleans at Hôtel-Dieu Hospital. A requiem mass was said for him at St. Louis Cathedral by Archbishop Philip Hannan. Hébert is entombed beside his wife in Lake Lawn Park Mausoleum in New Orleans.

==Legacy==
Hébert is responsible for founding the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. That university&#x27;s medical school, the F. Edward Hébert School of Medicine, is named for him.

On January 28, 2012, Hébert was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

F. Edward Hébert Hall, Building 7 at Hébert&#x27;s alma mater, Tulane University, houses Tulane&#x27;s Center for Academic Equity, its Africana Studies Department and its History Department. In 2017 Tulane&#x27;s Undergraduate Student Government resolved to request the board of administrators to allow Hébert Hall to be renamed. A student senator said, &quot;What does it say about what side of history Tulane is on when its History Department is housed in a building named after a segregationist?&quot; The students suggested &quot;Guillory and Elloie Hall&quot; for its new name, after Barbara Marie Guillory and Pearlie Hardin Elloie, the first two students of color to attend Tulane. Tulane&#x27;s Building Naming Task Force, which was made up of students, faculty, staff and alumni, recommended removing the Hébert name as the designation of the hall if legally possible and the Board of Tulane unanimously voted to authorize Tulane leadership to negotiate with the Hébert family as representatives of the F. Edward Hébert Foundation. However, according to University President Michael A. Fitts, &quot;Tulane was unable to reach an agreement to modify the legal requirement that Hébert&#x27;s name remain on the building.&quot; Beginning in the 2022-23 academic year, Hébert Hall will prominently feature contextual facts regarding the history of its naming.

Geographic numbers are nine digits long, including the area code, but not including the leading zero. Consequently, densely populated areas have shorter area codes, while less populated areas have longer area codes. For example:

* 6 xxxx xxxx (Osaka)
* 75 xxx xxxx (Kyoto)
* 742 xx xxxx (Nara)
* 4992 x xxxx (Niijima island, Tokyo pref.)
* 82486 xxxx (Takano, Hiroshima pref.)

Area codes increase from north to south; Sapporo in Hokkaidō (the northernmost prefecture) has 11, and Setouchi&#x27;s 99-73 is far to the south in Kagoshima. When the telephone system was devised, Okinawa was still under U.S. occupation, so when it was returned to Japan in 1972, its telephone numbers were squeezed between Miyazaki (98x) and Kagoshima (99x) and begin with 988, 989, and 980.

During the 1990s, when plans were being drawn up to amalgamate mid-sized cities and towns into larger municipalities, telephone numbering systems were merged in advance. For example,

*7442 x xxxx Kashihara (Nara prefecture)
*7444 x xxxx Sakurai
*74452 xxxx Takatori
*74454 xxxx Asuka etc.

became:

* 744 2x xxxx Kashihara
* 744 4x xxxx Sakurai
* 744 52 xxxx Takatori
* 744 54 xxxx Asuka etc.

Many of these towns have in fact refused to merge, leaving callers with more digits to dial when making local calls. This is partially balanced by not having to dial an area code for the neighboring city.

==Area code as local brand naming==

After entering the 2010s, local products and events have begun using names which come from the area code.

0465net (Odawara, Kanagawa)&lt;br&gt;
0428 T-shirt (Ome, Tokyo)&lt;br&gt;
028 Market (Utsunomiya, Tochigi)&lt;br&gt;
028 Machinaka (Inner-City) Wi-Fi (Utsunomiya, Tochigi) &lt;br&gt;
Bar 053 (Hamamatsu, Shizuoka)

<text>Zinner is a tiny lunar impact crater located due north of the crater Schiaparelli on the Oceanus Procellarum. It is circular and cup-shaped, with a high albedo in comparison to the surrounding lunar mare. The crater has essentially no rim because the mare lava nearly flooded it. A ray from the crater Glushko crosses Zinner. To the northwest is the slightly larger crater Golgi. East of Zinner is the Dorsa Burnet wrinkle ridge system.

This feature was previously designated Schiaparelli B before being given a name by the IAU.

<text>Mikhalko (Mikhail) Yuryevich (; died 20 June 1176) was Grand Prince of Vladimir in 1174, and from 1175 to 1176. He was a son of Yuri Dolgoruky.

==Life==
Yuri Dolgoruky&#x27;s eldest son by his second marriage, Mikhalko Yuryevich was removed from the Suzdal lands by his half-brother Andrei Bogolyubsky, who disliked his mother.

From 1162 to 1169 he lived in Ostyor, a small town near Chernigov, but he then moved on to the town of Torchesk. Appointed by Andrei to rule Kiev upon the death of Gleb Yuriyevich in 1171, Mikhalko refused to take the throne and sent his younger brother Vsevolod to Kiev instead. He was besieged in Torchesk by another claimant to Kiev, Yaropolk Rostislavich, but concluded peace with him and was allowed to move his capital to Pereiaslav. The starving of his subjects prompted Mikhail&#x27;s surrender after a week of holding the city. The next year, when Andrei invaded southern Rus&#x27;, he broke his ties with Rurik and swore allegiance to his brother.

Upon Andrei&#x27;s death, Yuryevich succeeded him in Vladimir, but he was forced to leave for Chernigov due to hostilities with boyars of Suzdal and Rostov, who felt neglected by the rise of Vladimir. The citizens of Vladimir soon called upon Yuryevich to help them fight against Yaropolk, son of Rostislav Yuryevich. He defeated this nephew of Andrei Bogolubsky and regained the throne of Vladimir in 1175. Mikhalko died the next year and was succeeded by his brother Vsevolod.

<doc id="940797" wikidata="Q614158" url="?curid=940797" title="Atabaque">
<text>The atabaque ( , , ) is a tall, wooden, Afro-Brazilian hand drum, similar to conga. 

The shell is made traditionally of Jacaranda wood from Brazil. The head is traditionally made from calfskin. A system of ropes are intertwined around the body, connecting a metal ring near the base to the head. Because of this tuning mechanism the drum is sometimes known as &#x27;Atabaque de Corda&#x27;. Wooden wedges are jammed between this ring and the body and a hammer is used to tighten or loosen the ropes, raising or lowering the pitch of the drum.

In Africa, cord-and-peg tension atabaques had a distribution area roughly congruent with the iron double bell (Agogo). This included the Guinea Coast from the Niger River and west to Benin, Togo, and Ghana. Beyond West Africa, cord-and-peg tension drums appeared in Bahia, Suriname, St. Domingue, Cuba, and the southern states of America. These drums traveled with the Ewe, Fon, Akan, and Yoruba people during the New World diaspora.

The atabaque is used in Capoeira, Maculelê and the Afro-Brazilian religions of Candomblé and Umbanda. It is considered sacred in Candomblé and Umbanda. The main instrument in Candomblé is the drum (Atabaque), skinned with cord-and-peg tension.

There are three types of atabaque: &quot;rum&quot;, the tallest with the lowest pitch; &quot;rum-pi&quot;, of medium height and in the middle pitch range; and &quot;lê&quot;, the smallest and highest-pitched.

In Maculelê and the rituals of Candomblé and Umbanda, as many as three Atabaques are used (usually one of each type), but in Capoeira, traditionally only one is used.

==Nomenclature==

The atabaque has several distinct parts. Some of these are the couro de boi (oxhide), the corda (rope) and the aro (hoop), forming where together the corda de aro (rope hoop). The acunhas are the Wedges, and the suporte is the atabaque stand.

On January 29, 1990, during his term as mayor, the city council approved a resolution making English the sole working language of city government. The council&#x27;s decision, which Fratesi had strongly supported, caused controversy within the town and across Canada. The resolution was widely seen as retaliation for Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa&#x27;s move to override the Supreme Court of Canada ruling that declared parts of Bill 101 unconstitutional. Bill 101 had declared French as the only official language of Quebec. Many prominent politicians, such as Premiers David Peterson and Bob Rae, and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, refused to meet with Fratesi on unrelated matters due to his stance. However, Fratesi was re-elected by a landslide in 1991. The resolution was struck down by a court ruling in 1994, one year after Premier Bourassa passed Bill 86 which amended that province&#x27;s language laws in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling.

Fratesi was involved in a conflict of interest controversy in 1995 when he applied for and got the post of chief administrative officer while still sitting as mayor. The Ontario Superior Court banned Fratesi from running for municipal officer for six years following a finding he had been in conflict of interest by applying for the chief administrative position while still holding the mayoral office. After stepping down as mayor, he was briefly replaced by Michael Sanzosti before former MP Steve Butland was elected in a special 1996 byelection. He retired as chief administrative officer in 2015.

<text>Mary Denise Rand, MBE (née Bignal; born 10 February 1940) is a British former track and field athlete. She won the long jump at the 1964 Summer Olympics by breaking the world record, the first British female to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field. Until Emma Finucane in 2024, she was the only British female athlete to win three medals in a single Games.

== Early life ==
Mary Rand is the daughter of Eric and Hilda Bignal. She was born and grew up in Wells, Somerset, England. At 16, Millfield School offered her an athletics scholarship. She excelled in all sports and won All-England Schools&#x27; titles. She was outstanding at high jump, long jump and hurdles. In 1956, she was a guest of the Olympic squad at a training camp in Brighton, where she beat Britain&#x27;s best high jumpers.

== Athletics career ==
At 17, Rand set a British record of 4,046 points in the pentathlon. She won a silver medal in the 1958 Commonwealth Games the long jump and came fifth in the high jump. One month later she came seventh in the European pentathlon championship.

In the 1960 Olympics in Rome, she set a British record of 6.33m in the qualifying round of the long jump, which if repeated, would have won a silver in the final. In the final she fouled two of the three jumps and finished ninth. She also finished fourth in the 80m hurdles. She won a bronze medal in the European championship long jump in 1962.

At the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Rand set an Olympic record in the long jump in the qualifying rounds, jumping 6.52m. In the final she beat the favourite, world record holder Tatyana Schelkanova of the USSR and Poland&#x27;s Irena Kirszenstein. Her first jump of 6.59m was a British record. However, in the fifth round, on a wet runway with a headwind of 1.6 metres a second, she broke the world record, leaping 6.76m to take gold. Her record lasted four years until it was broken at altitude by Viorica Viscopoleanu in the Mexico City Olympics.

Rand won the silver medal in the pentathlon, her 5,035 points putting her second in the all-time rankings. She was beaten to the gold by Irina Press, whose biological sex has been the subject of speculation. She also won a bronze as a member of the Great Britain team that finished third in the 4 x 100 metres relay.

Six days after Rand won the gold medal, her roommate Ann Packer won the 800 metres. Packer said: &quot;Mary was the most gifted athlete I ever saw. She was as good as athletes get, there has never been anything like her since. And I don&#x27;t believe there ever will.&quot;

Rand was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 New Year Honours for services to athletics and voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 1964.

After Tokyo, her training was less intensive, but she won a gold in the long jump at the 1966 Commonwealth Games. Due to injury, she failed to make the 1968 British Olympic team and retired in September that year.

Rand also held the world record in the triple jump from 1959 to 1981; it was unofficial as a world record because the women&#x27;s triple jump was not recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations until 1990.

Rand won 12 national WAAA Championships; six long jump titles (1959, 1961, &amp; 1963 to 1966) two high jump titles (1958 &amp; 1959) two sprint hurdles (1959 &amp; 1966) and two pentathlon titles (1959 &amp; 1960).

There is a plaque commemorating the world record long jump (6.76 metres) by Rand at the 1964 Olympic Games in the Market Place in Wells, the distance being marked out by a row of Olympic rings set into the pavement. She was succeeded as Golden Girl of British athletics by her friend and London Olympiades club-mate, Lillian Board.

In 2009, Rand was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

On 26 January 2012 Wells awarded her the Freedom of the City, following a campaign started by Wells resident Tony Williams.

== Personal life ==

Around 1960 Bignal dated Dutch decathlete Eef Kamerbeek. In 1961 she met rower Sid Rand. Three days after meeting she agreed to marry him and they married five weeks later. They had a daughter, Alison. The marriage lasted five years.

In December 1969, she married her second husband, American Bill Toomey, the 1968 Olympics&#x27; decathlon champion. This marriage lasted 22 years and they had two daughters, Samantha and Sarah. She later married John Reese and lives with him in Atascadero, California, in the United States. She holds dual UK/US citizenship.

<text>William Spencer Leveson-Gower, 4th Earl Granville (11 July 1880 – 25 June 1953), styled The Honourable William Leveson-Gower until 1939, was a British naval commander and governor from the Leveson-Gower family.

==Background==
Leveson-Gower was the younger son of Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, by his second wife Castilia Rosalind Campbell (daughter of Walter Frederick Campbell).

==Career==
After Wixenford School, William Leveson-Gower joined the Royal Navy in 1894. He was promoted to Sub Lieutenant in 1900, and lieutenant on 26 June 1902, when he was re-appointed to the torpedo cruiser HMS &quot;Scout&quot;. In August 1902 he was posted to HMS &quot;Hood&quot;, serving with the Mediterranean Fleet.

Promotion to commander followed in 1913. Leveson-Gower served in the First World War and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1919.

Leveson-Gower was appointed Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in 1924, aide-de-camp to the King in 1929 and Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Scotland in 1931. He was made a Companion of the Bath in 1930 and retired in 1935.

Leveson-Gower became Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man in 1937. He set up the War Consultative Committee in November 1939 to act as a &#x27;war cabinet&#x27; during World War II. The committee consisted of members of the House of Keys and the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man.

In 1939 Leveson-Gower succeeded his elder brother in the earldom. Granville was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1945 and became Governor of Northern Ireland in 1945, serving until 1952. He was made a Knight Companion of the Garter that same year.

<doc id="940850" wikidata="Q497915" url="?curid=940850" title="Vseslav of Polotsk">
<text>Vseslav Bryachislavich ( 1029 – 24 April 1101; also known as &quot;Vseslav the Sorcerer&quot; or &quot;Vseslav the Seer&quot;) was Prince of Polotsk (1044–1101) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1068–1069). Together with Rostislav Vladimirovich and voivode Vyshata, he created a coalition against the Yaroslaviches&#x27; triumvirate. Polotsk&#x27;s Cathedral of Holy Wisdom, completed in the mid-11th century, is one of the most enduring monuments from his reign and the oldest stone building in Belarus.

==Biography==
Vseslav was the son of Bryachislav Izyaslavich, Prince of Polotsk and Vitebsk, and was thus the great-grandson of Vladimir I of Kiev and Rogneda of Polotsk. He was born in c. 1029–1030 in Polotsk (with Vasilii as his baptismal name) and married around 1060.

He took the throne of Polotsk in 1044 upon his father&#x27;s death, and although since 1093 he was the senior member of the Rurik dynasty for his generation, since his father had not been prince in Kiev, Vseslav was excluded (izgoi) from the grand princely succession. In fact, since he was the only major prince in Rus not descended from Yaroslav, he was, according to Simon Franklin and Jonathan Shepard, &quot;an outsider from within&quot;

Unable to secure the capital, which was held by Yaroslav&#x27;s three sons, Vseslav started pillaging the northern areas of Kievan Rus. In 1065, he laid siege to Pskov but was thrown back. In the winter of 1066–1067, he pillaged and burnt Novgorod the Great, removing the bell and other religious objects from the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom and bringing them to decorate his own cathedral of the same name in Polotsk. His attack threatened to cut the sons of Yaroslav in the Middle Dnieper region off from Scandinavia, the Baltic region, and the far north, important sources of men, trade, and income (in furs for example) for the Rus princes in the Middle Dnieper. The attack also forced the young Mstislav, then enthroned in Novgorod, to flee back to his father, Iziaslav, in Kiev, and was thus and affront to the Kievan grand prince. The Yaroslavichi joined forces and marched north, sacking Minsk (then under the control of Polotsk) and defeating Vseslav in battle on the Nemiga River on March 3, 1067 Vseslav fled but was treacherously captured during the peace talks in June, when Iziaslav violated his oath. He was then imprisoned in Kiev.

During the Kiev Uprising of 1068, brought about by defeat at the hands of the Kipchaks on the Alta River and Iziaslav&#x27;s unwillingness to arm the veche, so its members could march out and face the nomads the second time, the crowd freed Vseslav from prison, and proclaimed him grand prince of Kiev, forcing Iziaslav to flee to Poland. Returning with an army seven months later, Iziaslav retook his throne, and Vseslav fled back to Polotsk. After several years of complicated struggle with Iziaslav of Kiev, he finally secured Polotsk in 1071. During the last 30 years of his reign, his chief enemies were Vsevolod Yaroslavich and Vsevolod&#x27;s son Vladimir Monomakh.

Vseslav died April 24, 1101, the Wednesday before Good Friday according to the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;—indeed the chronicles strangely link the two events, as if the sorcerer had died as a result of the crucifixion and resurrection. He was buried in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom in Polotsk.

==Family==
Vseslav had six sons:
#Roman (?-1114/1116), Prince of ? (probably of Drutsk). Roman perished either in Ryazan or Murom. His widow became a nun and lived in Polotsk, Saint Sophia Cathedral, where she opened her charity. They had no children.
#Gleb Vseslavich, Prince of Minsk;
#Rogvolod-Boris, Prince of Drutsk; There has been some discussion whether Vseslav had six or rather seven sons. Some historians (L.Alekseev and Vasily Tatishchev) believe that Boris was the baptism name of Rogvolod, and thus they were one and the same person.
#Davyd, Prince of Polotsk,
#Sviatoslav, Prince of Vitebsk;
#Rostislav, possibly Prince of Lukoml. In 1129, he was sent to Byzantium by Vladimir II Monomakh, with the rest of Vseslaviches. It is uncertain who his wife or his descendants were.

St. Euphrosyne of Polotsk is sometimes said to be Vseslav&#x27;s daughter, although her date of birth is given as 1120, two decades after Vseslav&#x27;s death and thus she could not be his child; other sources, however, say she was the daughter of Sviatoslav Vseslavich, and thus a granddaughter of Vseslav. She founded a number of monasteries in Polotsk and the surrounding region, and is considered one of the patron saints of Belarus.

==Vseslav in literature and legend==
===Vseslav in chronicles===
Vseslav had a great reputation for sorcery. The &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot; states that he was conceived by sorcery and was born with a caul (a veil of birth membrane) on his head, and that the sorcerers told his mother that this should be bound to his head for the rest of his life as it was a sign of good luck. In modern Belarusian he is known as Usiasłaŭ the Sorcerer; in Russian he is &quot;Vselav Charadei&quot; or &quot;Vseslav Veshchii&quot;, Vseslav the Sorcerer or Vseslav the Seer.

===Vseslav in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;===
Vseslav also appears in the 12th-century epic &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, where, as in several &quot;byliny&quot; or folk-tales, he is depicted as a werewolf. In &quot;The Igor Tale&quot;, his defeat at the Nemiga River is shown to illustrate that inter-princely strife is weakening the Russian land. Vseslav is also said to be able to hear the church bells (stolen from Novgorod) of his cathedral at Polotsk all the way from Kiev:

&quot;In the seventh age of Troyán Vséslav cast his lots for the Maiden dear to him.&quot;

&quot;He with wiles at the last tore himself free: and galloped to the city of Kíev; with his weapon took hold of the golden throne of Kíev; galloped from them like a wild beast at midnight from Bĕ́lgorod, swathed himself in a blue mist, rent asunder his bonds into three parts, opened wide the gates of Nóvgorod, shattered the Glory of Yarosláv [the First]; galloped like a wolf from Dudútki to the Nemíga.&quot;

&quot;On the Nemíga the sheaves are laid out with heads; men thresh with flails in hedgerows; on the barn-floor they spread out life; they winnow the soul from the body.&quot;

&quot;On the blood-stained Nemíga the banks were sown with bane,—sown with the bones of the sons of Russia.&quot;

&quot;Prince Vséslav was a judge to his subjects, he appointed cities for the princes: but he himself at night raced like a wolf from Kiev to the Idol [or, (accepting the reading of the text unaltered)—to the Lord] of Tmutarakáń, raced, like a wolf across the path of the great Khors.&quot;

&quot;To him at Polotsk they rang the bells early for matins at Saint Sophia; and he at Kíev heard the sound.&quot;

===Volkh Vseslavich/Volga Sviatoslavich and Vseslav of Polotsk===
Vseslav may also be the basis for the bogatyr Volkh Vseslavich or Volga Sviatoslavich, who is found in a cycle of byliny. &quot;Volkhvs&quot; were priests of the pre-Christian Slavic religion and were thought to possess magical powers. This fact may be tied to Vseslav&#x27;s alleged magical as well as his lupine aspects. In the Ruthenian Christianity volkhv is said to have been the son of a serpent and the Princess Marfa Vseslavevna and could transform himself into a wolf and other animals. That, of course, sounds as a fairy tale, however Christianity as a religion while still being challenged by people that followed the older traditions used this misinterpretation to outcast the followers of Slavic paganism. Volkhvs of Novgorod were well known to challenge the well established Christianity in Kiev in the 11th century, which resulted in Vseslav&#x27;s victory when Mstislav Iziaslavovich fled to Kiev. Not long after that the same volkhvs were calling to uprising against Gleb Sviatoslavovich. Volkh appears in a number of drawings by the late-19th and early 20th-century Russian artist Ivan Bilibin, who was heavily influenced by Russian folklore.

<text>Clarina Irene Howard Nichols (January 25, 1810 – January 11, 1885) was a journalist, lobbyist and public speaker involved in all three of the major reform movements of the mid-19th century: temperance, abolition, and the women&#x27;s movement that emerged largely out of the ranks of the first two. Though prominent enough in her time to merit her own chapter in Anthony&#x27;s &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, Nichols has been overlooked since 1900 and only recently have her contributions to equal rights undergone a reassessment.

==Biography==
Born in West Townshend, Vermont in 1810, into a prosperous New England family, Clarina Nichols fell on hard times after a disastrous early marriage. Supporting herself and her children on &quot;women&#x27;s wages&quot; — one-half to one-third what men received for similar work — she began writing for a newspaper in Brattleboro, Vermont, the &quot;Windham County Democrat in 1845&quot;. She married the editor and publisher, George Nichols; when he became an invalid, she quietly took over his duties at the paper. Through her new profession, she was introduced to various reform movements of the day — temperance, women&#x27;s rights, anti-slavery, dress and diet reform — and embraced many of them.

She helped organize the fledgling women&#x27;s movement in the East. In October 1852, she helped organize the first of several petitions submitted to the Vermont legislature to give women the right to vote in school meetings.

When the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 threatened to establish slavery outside of the South, Clarina Nichols uprooted her family to become a pioneer and activist in Kansas. Her efforts helped catapult her adopted state into the forefront of women&#x27;s rights, gaining the respect and support of such women as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. During the course of an ever-busy life, Clarina Nichols served as teacher, lecturer, editor, writer, farmer, lay doctor and lawyer, government clerk, matron in a home for destitute black children and widows, and conductor on the Underground Railroad. She died in 1885 in California, where she pioneered and agitated to the end.

She was an active Underground Railroad Station Master and Conductor while living in Quindaro, Kansas. She left a letter telling about a time when a Freedom Seeker named Caroline was brought to her house. Caroline&#x27;s slave master and other slave hunters were camped on the edge of town and looking for her. Clarina tells of hiding Caroline in an empty cistern overnight and then sending her on the road North as soon as it was safe.

<text>Pansarsprängvinggranat m/94 &quot;STRIX&quot; is a Swedish endphase-guided projectile fired from a 120 mm mortar currently manufactured by Saab Bofors Dynamics.

STRIX is fired like a conventional mortar round. The round contains an infrared imaging sensor that it uses to guide itself onto any tank or armoured fighting vehicle in the vicinity where it lands. The seeker is designed to ignore targets that are already burning.

Launched from any 120 mm mortar, Strix has a normal range of up to . With the addition of a special sustainer motor, however, range can be increased to .

The Strix mortar round uses twelve midsection lateral thruster rockets to provide terminal course corrections.

The tail unit is loaded first with the necessary propelling charges (up to eight increments), then the sustainer motor (if required) and finally, the programmed projectile. A hand-held programming unit is connected to the projectile by cable prior to loading to feed in flight time before seeker activation, and with allowances for terminal phase ballistic conditions.

As well as being fired by conventional mortars, STRIX can be fired by the Advanced Mortar System, an automatic dual 120 mm mortar mounted in a turret for fitting to armoured fighting vehicles.

Feasibility and project definition studies began in 1983, as a joint private venture between FFV Ordnance and Saab Missiles. The first fully guided flight took place in 1988. FFV expected to complete development this year, and to receive a Swedish Army production contract shortly thereafter. The company reports considerable foreign interest, in particular from the US Marine Corps. STRIX has been in service with the Swedish and Swiss Armies since 1994.

<doc id="940888" wikidata="Q575540" url="?curid=940888" title="Blighty">
<text>&quot;Blighty&quot; is a British English slang term for Great Britain, or often specifically England. Though it was used throughout the 1800s in the Indian subcontinent to mean an English or British visitor, it was first used during the Boer War in the specific meaning of homeland for the English or British, and it was not until World War I that use of the term became widespread.

== Etymology ==
The word ultimately derives from the Persian word , (from a regional Hindustani language with the use of b replacing v) meaning &#x27;foreign&#x27;, which more specifically came to mean &#x27;European&#x27;, and &#x27;British; English&#x27; during the time of the British Raj. The Bengali word is a loan of Indian Persian (), from () meaning &#x27;Iran&#x27; and later &#x27;Europe&#x27; or &#x27;Britain&#x27;, ultimately from Arabic meaning &#x27;state, province&#x27;.

The term subsequently gained an ironic connotation in its closeness to the English word &quot;blight&quot;, meaning epidemic. It&#x27;s an example of typical post-imperial British self-effacement.

==Context==
Blighty is commonly used as a term of endearment by the expatriate British community or those on holiday to refer to home. In &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot;, an 1886 historical dictionary of Anglo-Indian words, Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell explained that the word came to be used in British India for several things the British had brought into the country, such as the tomato and soda water.

During the First World War, &quot;Dear Old Blighty&quot; was a common sentimental reference, suggesting a longing for home by soldiers in the trenches. The term was particularly used by World War I poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. During that war, a &quot;Blighty wound&quot; – a wound serious enough to require recuperation away from the trenches but not serious enough to kill or maim the victim – was hoped for by many, and sometimes self-inflicted.

==Examples==

An early example of the usage of a derivative of the Arabic being used to refer to Britain is after diplomat I&#x27;tisam-ud-Din returned from Britain back to the Mughal Empire. The locals nicknamed him &quot;Bilayet Munshi&quot; due to him being the first South Asian (c. 1765) to travel to what was known as the Bilayet.

&quot;Blighty&quot;, a humorous weekly magazine, was issued free to British troops during the First World War. It contained short stories, poems, cartoons, paintings, and drawings, with contributions from men on active service. It was distributed by the War Office, the Admiralty and the Red Cross, and subsidised through donations and sales to the general public. The magazine was revived in 1939 and continued until 1958.

In his First World War autobiography &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; (1929), the writer Robert Graves attributes the term &quot;Blitey&quot; to the Hindustani word for &#x27;home&#x27;. He writes: &quot;The men are pessimistic but cheerful. They all talk about getting a &#x27;&#x27; one to send them back to &#x27;Blitey&#x27;.&quot;

The music hall artiste Vesta Tilley had a hit in 1916 with the song &quot;I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;ve Got a Bit of a Blighty One&quot; (1916), in which she played a soldier delighted to have been wounded and in hospital. &quot;When I think about my dugout,&quot; she sang, &quot;where I dare not stick my mug out... I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve got a bit of a blighty one&quot;. Another music hall hit was &quot;Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty&quot; (1917). The song is sung by Cicely Courtneidge in the 1962 film &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot;. The term was also referenced in the song &quot;All American Alien Boy&quot; by Ian Hunter (&quot;I&#x27;m just a whitey from Blighty&quot;), from the 1976 album of the same name. Folksinger Ian Robb&#x27;s album &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; features a topical parody of the traditional song &quot;Maggie May&quot;, about the Falklands War. The song contains the lines: &quot;When I get back to Blighty, I&#x27;ll give thanks to The Almighty / Whether Maggie&#x27;s little war is lost or won&quot;.

UKTV operated a digital television channel called Blighty that opened in February 2009 and closed on 5 July 2013. The subscription channel, which concentrated on British-made programming, was replaced by a Freeview channel called Drama.

<doc id="940900" wikidata="Q476719" url="?curid=940900" title="Maculelê (stick dance)">
<text>Maculelê () is an Afro-Brazilian stick-dance from Bahia.

Maculele, a stick fighting dance from Santo Amaro, was introduced to a wider audience by &quot;Viva Bahia&quot;, a capoeira theater group founded in 1963. Viva Bahia&#x27;s founder, Emília Biancardi, had researched Bahian folklore for many years and integrated maculele into her group&#x27;s performances. Major capoeira groups, such as those led by mestres Bimba, Pastinha, and Canjiquinha, soon adopted maculele as well.

==Origins==

The German painter Rugendas observed African slaves stick fighting during the 1820s in Brazil:

That stick fighting and dancing have endured into the twentieth century through forms like maculêlê.

==Form==
In the roda, one or more atabaques positioned at the entrance of the circle. Each person brandishes a pair of long sticks, traditionally made from biriba, canzi, or pitia wood from Brazil. The sticks, called grimas, traditionally measure long by thick. As the Maculelê rhythm plays on the atabaque, the people in the circle begin rhythmically striking the sticks together. The leader sings, and the people in the circle respond by singing the chorus of the songs. When the leader gives the signal to begin playing Maculelê, two people enter the circle, and to the rhythm of the atabaque, they begin striking their own and each other&#x27;s sticks together. On the first three beats, they strike their own sticks together, making expressive and athletic dance movements, and on each fourth beat, they strike each other&#x27;s respective right-hand stick together. This makes for a dance that looks like &quot;mock stick combat&quot;. (Also, traditionally in Maculelê, the players wear dried grass skirts).

Maculelê has steps similar to many other Brazilian dances such as &quot;frevo&quot; from Pernambuco, &quot;Moçambique&quot; from São Paulo, &quot;Cana-verde&quot; from Vassouras-RJ, &quot;Bate-pau&quot; from Mato Grosso, &quot;Tudundun&quot; from Pará among others.

==Capoeira==
In some capoeira schools, students perform maculelê using a pair of machetes or facones (&quot;facão&quot; in Portuguese; plural: &quot;facões&quot;). These large knives are associated with the tools used by slaves in plantations. The knives spark as they strike in the air, and the sparks along with the sounds of the knives striking one another make this performance particularly impressive. Because a fast moving dance with large knives is dangerous, only very experienced capoeiristas will use knives.

==In popular culture==
Maculelê was performed as a group dance in the Canadian version of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;.

<doc id="940909" wikidata="Q930383" url="?curid=940909" title="Romantic fantasy">
<text>Romantic fantasy or romantasy is a subgenre of fantasy fiction that combines fantasy and romance, describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the chivalric romance genre. One of the key features of romantic fantasy involves the focus on relationships, social, political, and romantic.

Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy lines and romance lines. As a result of the financial success of authors such as Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros in the 2000s, publishers created imprints to focus on this subgenre. Some publishers distinguish between &quot;romantic fantasy&quot; where the fantasy elements is most important and &quot;fantasy romance&quot; where the romance are most important. Others say that &quot;the borderline between fantasy romance and romantic fantasy has essentially ceased to exist, or if it&#x27;s still there, it&#x27;s moving back and forth constantly&quot;. Game historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;the heroes and heroines of romantic fantasy seek social connection and emotional wealth. Instead of carrying on by themselves, they find belonging in a community and a purpose larger than themselves. Magic and psychic abilities are often in-born talents; intelligent animals speak; and societies are egalitarian.&quot;

==2023–2024 romantasy trend==

In 2023 and 2024, romantic fantasy novels termed &quot;romantasy&quot; became a social media trend. Sales of the books have been widely driven by promotion on social media, particularly the part of TikTok known as BookTok. &quot;The Economist&quot; notes that the genre has particular appeal to those who grew up reading young-adult fantasy, such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, and are now interested in similar themes, but with adult themes of sex and romance. Popular authors in the genre include Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros, whose &quot;Fourth Wing&quot;, &quot;Iron Flame&quot;, and &quot;Onyx Storm&quot; have all broken sales records and are due to be made into a TV series. Authors of novels labeled as romantasy are largely women, as is the market, and the novels are known for representing minorities.

<text>Brattahlíð (), often anglicised as Brattahlid, was Erik the Red&#x27;s estate in the Eastern Settlement Viking colony he established in south-western Greenland toward the end of the 10th century. The present settlement of Qassiarsuk, approximately southwest from the Narsarsuaq settlement, is now located in its place. The site is located about from the ocean, at the head of the Tunulliarfik Fjord, and hence sheltered from ocean storms. Erik and his descendants lived there until about the mid-15th century. The name &quot;Brattahlíð&quot; means &quot;the steep slope&quot;. The estate, along with other archeological sites in southwestern Greenland, was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2017 as Kujataa Greenland: Norse and Inuit Farming at the Edge of the Ice Cap.

== Church ==
At Brattahlíð stood probably the first European church in the Americas: Þjóðhildarkirkja (Thjodhild&#x27;s church, actually a small chapel). A recent reconstruction of this chapel now stands at a distance from the actual site, along with a replica of a Norse longhouse.

At the site of the main church, built after the Norse converted to Christianity, investigators have found melted fragments of bell metal, and foundation stones of it and other buildings remained into the 20th century, as did the remnants of a possible forge. This church (not Thjodhild&#x27;s chapel) measured by and had two entrances, with what was evidently a hearth in the middle. Apparently, fire destroyed it. The church, possibly a 14th-century structure, may have stood on the ruins of an earlier church. The churchyard has tombstones, with a cross cut on one of them. On another stand engraved the runes for &quot;Ingibjørg&#x27;s Grave&quot;. Stones mark the church&#x27;s outline, though people probably placed them there in recent years; visitors can also see the surrounding graveyard.

== Farm ==
One farm building nearby measured by , with stone walls about thick; a turf outer bank provided further insulation. Inside, it had a flagstone floor. Flat stones — or, in one case, the shoulder-blade of a whale — formed the stalls. Some of these buildings still stood in 1953, contemporaneous with the Bluie West One airfield at Narsarsuaq, but today they exist mostly as depressions in the ground.

Brattahlíð still has some of the best farmland in Greenland, owing to its location at the inner end of Eriksfjord, which protects it from the cold foggy weather and arctic waters of the outer coast. It has a youth hostel and a small store. More extensive facilities exist in Narsarsuaq across the fjord.

== Assembly ==
Brattahlíð hosted the first Greenlandic &quot;Þing&quot; (parliament), based on the Icelandic Althing. In the early 20th century through written sources and archeological evidence, scholars identified two potential &quot;Þing&quot; sites at Brattahlíð and at Garðar. Given the sparse nature of the Greenlandic settlement, it is reasonable that the participants of a &quot;Þing&quot; would have taken the opportunity for social interaction or trade.

The exact causes of the disappearance of the Norse settlements toward the end of the 15th century remain unverified, but probably resulted from a combination of the Little Ice Age&#x27;s cooling temperatures, soil erosion, abandonment by Norway after the Black Plague and political turmoils, more convenient ways for Europeans to procure furs and a mercantile eclipsing by the Hanseatic League, and competition from the Inuit moving southward.

<doc id="940923" wikidata="Q348689" url="?curid=940923" title="Vsevolod the Big Nest">
<text>Vsevolod III Yuryevich, or Vsevolod the Big Nest (; 1154–1212), was Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1176 to 1212. During his long reign, the city reached the zenith of its glory.

==Family==
Vsevolod was the tenth or eleventh son of Yuri Dolgoruky (c. 1099 – 1157), who founded the town Dmitrov to commemorate the site of Vsevolod&#x27;s birth. Nikolai Karamzin (1766 – 1826) initiated the speculation identifying Vsevolod&#x27;s mother Helene as a Greek princess, because after her husband&#x27;s death she took Vsevolod with her to Constantinople.

Vsevolod spent his youth at the chivalric court of the Komnenoi. On his return from the Byzantine Empire to Rus&#x27; in 1170, Vsevolod supposedly visited Tbilisi, as a local chronicle records that that year the Georgian king entertained his nephew from Constantinople and married him to his relative, an Ossetian princess.

==Reign==

In 1173 two Smolensk princes captured Kiev (Kyiv), captured Vsevolod and briefly installed him on the throne. Ransomed a year later, Vsevolod took his brother Mikhalko&#x27;s side in his struggle against the powerful boyars of Rostov and Suzdal. Upon Mikhalko&#x27;s death in 1176, Vsevolod succeeded him in Vladimir. He promptly subjugated the boyars and systematically raided the Volga peoples, notably Volga Bulgaria. He installed puppet rulers on the throne of Novgorod and married his daughters to princes of Chernigov and Kiev.

Vsevolod showed little mercy to those who disobeyed his commands. In 1180 and 1187 he punished the princes of Ryazan by ousting them from their lands. In 1207 he burned to the ground both Ryazan and Belgorod. His military fame spread quickly. &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, thought to be written during Vsevolod&#x27;s reign, addresses him thus: &quot;Great prince Vsevolod! Don&#x27;t you think of flying here from afar to safeguard the paternal golden throne of Kiev? For you can with your oars scatter in drops the Volga, and with your helmets scoop dry the Don.&quot;

But Kievan matters concerned Vsevolod little in the latter part of his reign. He concentrated on building up his own capital, Vladimir. His Ossetian wife, Maria Shvarnovna, who devoted herself to works of piety and founded several convents, was glorified by the Russian church as a saint. By her Vsevolod had no fewer than fourteen children, thus earning for himself the sobriquet &quot;Big Nest&quot;.

== Death and succession ==
Before his death, grand prince Vsevolod divided his territories between his sons, with the second-oldest Yuri receiving the largest share. Four of them, Konstantin, George, Yaroslav and Sviatoslav, succeeded him as Grand Dukes of Vladimir. Vsevolod died on 12 April 1212 and was buried at the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir.

Immediately after Vsevolod&#x27;s death, the Vladimir-Suzdal war of succession (1212–1216) broke out between his sons, who each sought a larger share of his inheritance for themselves.

==Marriage and children==
Vsevolod married first Maria, whose origins are disputed. She has been variously identified as Ossetian, Alan and Moravian. They had at least fourteen children:

*Sbyslava (Pelagia) Vsevolodovna (born 26 October 1178).
*Vseslava Vsevolodovna. Married Rostislav Yaroslavich, Prince of Snovsk. He was a son of Yaroslav II Vsevolodovich, Prince of Chernigov. His paternal grandfather was Vsevolod II of Kiev.
*Verchoslava Vsevolodovna. Married Rostislav II of Kiev. 
*Konstantin of Rostov (18 May 1186 – 2 February 1218). 
*Boris Vsevolodovich. (c. 1187–1238). 
*Gleb Vsevolodovich (d. 29 September 1189). 
*Yuri II of Vladimir (1189 – 4 March 1238). 
*Yaroslav II of Vladimir (8 February 1191 – 30 September 1246). 
*Helena Vsevolodovna (d. 1204). 
*Vladimir Vsevolodovich, Prince of Yuryev-Polsky (25 October 1192 – 6 January 1227).
*Sviatoslav III of Vladimir (27 March 1196 – 3 February 1252).
*Ioann Vsevolodovich, Prince of Starodub (28 November 1197 – after 1247). 
*Anna Vsevolodovna. Married Vladimir, Prince of Belgorod (d. 1239). 

Maria died in 1205 or 1206. Vsevolod married Liubov Vasilkovna in 1209. She was a daughter of Vasilko Bryacheslavich, Prince of Vitebsk. They had no known children.

<text>Jonah J. &quot;Bud&quot; Greenspan (September 18, 1926December 25, 2010) was an American film director, writer, and producer known for his sports documentaries.

==Career==
Greenspan was born in New York City. He overcame a lisp in adolescence and went into sports broadcasting after graduating from New York University. In 1947 Greenspan became sports director at New York City&#x27;s WMGM, at that time the largest sports radio station in the US, when he was 21 years old. When he left WMGM, Greenspan began contributing articles to magazines while also producing television commercials.

He dabbled in documentary filmmaking in 1952, with &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot;, a 15-minute feature on weightlifter John Davis, but he began his filmmaking career in earnest in 1964, accompanying Jesse Owens to West Berlin to film &quot;Jesse Owens Returns to Berlin&quot;. In 1967, he formed his own film company, &quot;Cappy Productions, Inc.&quot;, with wife Cappy Petrash Greenspan (deceased 1983). After his wife&#x27;s death, Greenspan ran Cappy Productions with his companion Nancy Beffa.

Several hour-long productions followed. Greenspan won his first Emmy for 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Olympiad&quot;, 22 hour-long documentary specials on the Olympics (including &quot;Jesse Owens Returns to Berlin&quot;). The series was broadcast in 80 countries. In 1977, he branched into docudrama with the two-hour movie of the week biography of gold-medalist Wilma Rudolph. &quot;Wilma,&quot; starring Cicely Tyson, featured Denzel Washington in his first movie role. In 1979, he launched the first of several vignette series: &quot;This Day in Sports&quot;, which aired on CBS, featured 365 30-second film shorts highlighting exciting sports moments from years past. It was followed in 1980 by the similar &quot;Olympic Moments&quot;, &quot;Olympic Events&quot; and &quot;Olympic Vignettes&quot;.

In addition to his prolific film work, Greenspan continued working in other media. He was a contributing editor for &quot;PARADE&quot; magazine. He also authored a number of books, including several on the Olympics, a book of sports bloopers called &quot;Play It Again, Bud&quot;, and &quot;We Wuz Robbed&quot;, which addresses sports controversies. &quot;Great Moments in Sports&quot;, his first album, went gold and led him to produce 18 more spoken word albums.

==Awards and recognition==

Greenspan&#x27;s work was recognized many times. He received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Directors Guild of America in 1995 and from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences at the 2006 Annual Sports Emmy Awards. In 1996, he received a George Foster Peabody Award to recognize &quot;distinguished and meritorious public service&quot;, cited as one of the industry&#x27;s most prestigious awards.

Greenspan received the Olympic Order award in 1985, at which time International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch said, &quot;Mr. Greenspan has been called the foremost producer, writer and director of Olympic films; more than that, he is an everlasting friend of the Olympic family.&quot; In 2004, Greenspan was inducted as a &quot;Special Contributor&quot; into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. His visual and musical &quot;The Spirit of the Olympics&quot; is on display permanently at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1994, Greenspan was inducted in the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was given the &quot;Al Schoenfield Media Award&quot; by the International Swimming Hall of Fame. Bud Greenspan Circuit, Lidcombe, is a street in a housing development on the site the media centre at the Sydney Olympics.

==Death==
Greenspan died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on December 25, 2010, at the age of 84 in New York City.

<text>Delinquent Habits is an American hip hop group, formed in Norwalk, California in 1991. They are known for their Latin-tinged rap, which is both melodic and hardcore. Their first album was executive produced by Cypress Hill member Sen Dog and featured guest appearances by Sen himself as well as Puerto Rican New York City rapper Hurricane G. Their second album, &quot;Here Come the Horns&quot;, again featured Sen Dog as well as Sen&#x27;s brother, pioneering Latin rapper Mellow Man Ace. The melodic &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; featured the female singer Michelle Belle. The group chose to focus more on hardcore rap on their fourth offering, &quot;Freedom Band&quot;.

== History ==

Delinquent Habits was originally made up of two emcees Kemo The Blaxican (born David L.K. Thomas, April 13, 1969) and Ives Irie (born Ivan S. Martin, August 4, 1971), and a DJ/producer O.G. Style (born Alejandro R. Martinez, July 3, 1970). Thus the group was often called Los Tres Delinquentes (Spanish spelling: &quot;los tres delincuentes&quot;; Spanish for &#x27;The Three Delinquents&#x27;). As a trio, they sold over 1 million copies of their single &quot;Tres Delinquentes&quot;, published on the RCA label in 1996. They subsequently received a lot of attention from MTV and the media. Their self-titled debut album and their second releases were executive produced by Paul Stewart and Sen Dog. Almost a million copies of &quot;Delinquent Habits&quot; were sold. They have been compared to Cypress Hill. Their third album, &quot;Merry Go-Round&quot;, was published by ARK 21 Records and sold on the underground &quot;Spanglish network&quot;.

Kemo soon left the band after the completion of their album &quot;Freedom Band&quot; to pursue a solo career with some substantial success. He released his debut album in 2004, titled &quot;Simple Plan&quot;. He was replaced by female vocalist Michelle Belle (born Michelle Miralles), who had been previously featured in some of their songs. She released her debut album in 2016, titled &quot;Nothing More, Nothing Less&quot;. Around five years after Kemo&#x27;s exit, O.G. Style also left the band.

<doc id="940972" wikidata="Q2665468" url="?curid=940972" title="Dwight Morrow">
<text>Dwight Whitney Morrow (January 11, 1873October 5, 1931) was an American businessman, diplomat, and politician, best known as the U.S. ambassador who improved U.S.–Mexico relations, mediating the religious conflict in Mexico known as the Cristero rebellion (1926–29), but also contributing to an easing of conflict between the two countries over oil. The Morrow Mission to Mexico was an &quot;important step in the &#x27;retreat from imperialism.&#x27; &quot; He was the father of Anne Morrow and father-in-law of Charles A. Lindbergh.

==Life==
Of Scotch-Irish descent, Morrow was born in Huntington, West Virginia. He moved with his parents, James Elmore and Clara (Johnson) Morrow to Allegheny, Pennsylvania in 1875. His father James was principal of Marshall College, which is now Marshall University. Morrow&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Alexander Morrow had immigrated to America from Ireland around the year 1803. Before this, Alexander&#x27;s ancestors had come from Scotland. After graduating from Amherst College in 1895, Morrow studied law at Columbia Law School and began practicing at the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in New York City. In 1903, he married Elizabeth Reeve Cutter, his college sweetheart, with whom he had four children. Anne Morrow, his daughter, later married Charles A. Lindbergh, whom she met while her father was Ambassador to Mexico. In 1913, he became a partner at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., one of the largest and most powerful commercial and investment banks in the United States during this era, financially backing industrial giants such as General Motors and 3M. As a partner at Morgan, he served as a director on many corporate and financial boards.

With the onset of World War I in Europe, the bank lent Britain and France large sums of money with which they purchased war materials in the U.S. When the United States entered the war, Morrow became the director of the National War Savings Committee for the State of New Jersey. He also served abroad as adviser to the Allied Maritime Transport Council and as a civilian member of the Military Board of Allied Supply. With his proven logistical and intellectual talents, Morrow was sent to France by President Woodrow Wilson to serve as chief civilian aide to General John J. Pershing.

In 1925, Morrow was summoned by his old Amherst College classmate and friend, President Calvin Coolidge, to lead a board of inquiry into aviation in the U.S. In September of that year, Coolidge ordered the court-martial of Colonel Billy Mitchell of the Army Air Service for &quot;conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline.&quot; The trial was scheduled for November. Anticipating adverse political reaction to the trial, and seeking to shape aviation policy in accordance with his own economic views, Coolidge asked Morrow to head a board of military and civilian aviation experts to inquire into all aspects of aviation. The board&#x27;s report, published before Mitchell&#x27;s conviction, recommended the creation of an Air Corps within the Army equivalent to the Signal Corps or Quartermaster Corps, which resulted in the establishment of the U.S. Army Air Corps in July 1926.

==Ambassador to Mexico==
Morrow was appointed United States Ambassador to Mexico by Coolidge from 1927 to 1930. Upon learning the news, the Mexican press had expected that the appointment of a partner of the financial firm J.P. Morgan was &quot;a return to Dollar Diplomacy.&quot; However, the Coolidge administration planned on changing relations between Mexico and the U.S., which Morrow was to implement. One of Morrow&#x27;s first acts in Mexico was to change the sign identifying the embassy from &quot;American Embassy&quot; to &quot;United States Embassy&quot;; the appropriation of the words &quot;America&quot; and &quot;American&quot; to refer solely to the United States had long rankled other countries in the hemisphere, including Mexico.

Morrow was widely hailed as a brilliant ambassador, mixing popular appeal with sound economic and financial advice to the Mexican government. In 1927, he invited popular humorist-actor Will Rogers and famed aviator Charles Lindbergh for a goodwill tour of Mexico. His daughter, Anne Morrow, was introduced to Lindbergh, and the two were soon engaged. To thank the town of Cuernavaca, where Morrow owned a vacation home, Morrow hired the Mexican artist Diego Rivera to paint murals in the Palace of Cortez, which are a chronicle of Mexican history from a post-Mexican Revolution point of view.

Morrow initiated a series of breakfast meetings with President Plutarco Elías Calles (1924–1928), at which the two would discuss a range of issues, from oil and irrigation to a religious uprising in Mexico. This earned Morrow the nickname &quot;ham and eggs diplomat&quot; in U.S. newspapers. Morrow also invited Rogers to accompany him and Calles on a tour of Mexico, with Rogers sending favorable human-interest stories about Mexico and Mexicans back to U.S. newspapers, helping to change U.S. perceptions of Mexico.

In a dispute about Mexican petroleum, with U.S. and other foreign oil companies demanding protection of their interests in Mexico, Morrow helped prevent Mexican nationalization of the oilfields. The nationalization did, however, occur ten years later in 1938.

Morrow&#x27;s best known accomplishment was his mediation of the conflict between the Mexican government and the Catholic Church in Mexico which had escalated into a violent armed revolt, known as the Cristero rebellion. It was not in the security interests of the United States for such internal disorder to be occurring in its neighbor to the south, not least because of the flight of Mexican refugees to the U.S. from the regions of conflict. Morrow&#x27;s efforts at mediation were successful, and he was aided by Father John J. Burke of the National Catholic Welfare Conference. The Vatican was also actively seeking peace in Mexico.

After the assassination in 1928 of the newly re-elected President Álvaro Obregón, former president Calles was ineligible to serve again due to term limits, and the Mexican Congress named Emilio Portes Gil as president. In practice, Calles remained in power during a period known as the Maximato. As interim president in December 1928, Portes Gil permitted Morrow and Burke to revitalize their peace initiative. Portes Gil told a foreign correspondent on May 1 that &quot;the Catholic clergy, when they wish, may renew the exercise of their rites with only one obligation, that they respect the laws of the land.&quot;

Morrow managed to bring the war parties to agreement on June 21, 1929. His office drafted a pact called the &quot;arreglos&quot; (agreement) that permitted worship to resume in Mexico and granted three concessions to the Catholics: only priests who were named by hierarchical superiors would be required to register, religious instruction in the churches (but not in the schools) would be permitted, and all citizens, including the clergy, would be allowed to make petitions to reform the laws. The anticlerical articles of the Constitution of 1917 remained in place but were not systematically enforced.

==Later career==
In 1930 Morrow was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Walter Evans Edge. At the same time 
he was elected for the full-term commencing on March 4, 1931. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society that same year. He served in the Senate from December 3, 1930, until his death in Englewood, New Jersey, on October 5, 1931.

==Death==
Following a speaking engagement in New York City, Morrow suffered a stroke in his sleep at his home in Englewood, New Jersey and died the next afternoon on October 5, 1931.

A partner at J.P. Morgan, Morrow was one of the richest men in New Jersey. Morrow&#x27;s death occurred within 30 days of the next election allowing the Republican Governor Morgan Foster Larson to appoint William Warren Barbour as Morrow&#x27;s successor in the U.S. Senate.

Morrow was interred at Brookside Cemetery in Englewood.

Morrow&#x27;s will was dated January 24, 1927, and made over $1 million in specific bequests, including $200,000 to Amherst College, $200,000 to Smith College, $100,000 to the Smithsonian Institution, and several other bequests to family and friends. The estate was valued at about $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The large $1,000,000 in estate taxes paid to the state of New Jersey enabled the state to balance their books. In addition, a $1 million trust fund had been set up for Anne Morrow Lindbergh in 1929.

Morrow&#x27;s personal papers are held by the Archives &amp; Special Collections in Robert Frost Library at Amherst College. In 1934, Betty Morrow requested that the British diplomat and writer Harold Nicolson write the definitive biography of her late husband. Nicolson stayed with the family at Englewood and in Maine for several months, drawing on interviews with them, Morrow&#x27;s partners at J.P. Morgan, and with former Mexican president Plutarco Elias Calles for his book. It was published as &quot;Dwight Morrow&quot; in October 1935.

===Legacy===
Dwight Morrow High School, founded in 1932, was named in his honor. It is a public school serving students in Englewood and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

==In popular culture==
He was portrayed by Bruce Greenwood in the 2012 film &quot;For Greater Glory&quot; set during the Cristero War.

<text>Rurik Rostislavich, also spelt Riurik, (died 1215) was Prince of Novgorod (1170–1171), Belgorod (1173–1194), Grand Prince of Kiev (1173; 1180–1181; 1194–1201; 1203–1204; 1205-1206; 1207–1210), and Prince of Chernigov (1210–1214). 

== Life ==
Rurik was the son of Rostislav I of Kiev. Succession conflicts intermittently placed Rurik on the throne of the Kievan Rus&#x27; no fewer than six times between 1173 and 1210.

According to the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; account, in 1182, Rurik became co-ruler with Sviatoslav III Vsevolodovich of Kiev (who had become prince of Kiev in 1177), a &quot;duumvirate&quot; arrangement that lasted until Sviatoslav&#x27;s death in 1194. According to the &quot;Novgorod Fourth Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Sofia First Chronicle&quot; tradition &quot;sub anno&quot; 6688 (1180) and 6693 (1185), Sviatoslav reigned alone, and there is no mention of Rurik as co-prince.

Rurik ruled alone until 1199, when his rule was challenged by Roman the Great, who deposed Rurik.

After a brief stint in Chernigov, where he built the Church of St. Paraskebas, Rurik, along with his kinsmen and a Cuman army, attacked and sacked Kiev in 1203, but was repelled until Roman&#x27;s death in 1205. Rurik had been confined to a monastery in 1204, but he abandoned his holy vows and returned to the throne.

His cousin, Vsevolod, felt that Rurik&#x27;s previous monastic vows rendered his authority invalid, and so attacked and briefly seized Kiev in 1206, 1207, and 1211. He succeeded in capturing Rurik, who died in captivity in Chernigov.

Rurik was married to Anna of Turov; among their children was Rostislav II of Kiev.

<doc id="941056" wikidata="Q2054371" url="?curid=941056" title="Kingston Vale">
<text>Kingston Vale with Kingston Hill is a district in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames in south-west London. It is a residential area between Richmond Park, the much smaller Putney Vale, Wimbledon Common, Coombe/Coombe Hill and the Norbiton part of the very old borough. The main road is the A308 (also called Kingston Vale and Kingston Hill) which is a through route for traffic passing to and from Kingston Hill to the A3 trunk road (locally known as the &quot;Kingston By-pass&quot;). Many of the branch roads are cul-de-sacs. It includes, toward the east and in the Vale, the only part of Kingston which drains eastward, that is, into Beverley Brook. The hill expanse, shared with Coombe and a golf course, has a hotel, some tall blocks overlooking Kingston, the edge of Kingston Hospital, the main campus of Kingston University London and faint remnants of dense woodland.

==History==

An inn, the Bald-Faced Stag, stood on the site of the present day Asda from around 1650 into the 19th century. The inn was reputedly a haunt of the highwayman Jerry Abershawe until his execution in 1795, after which his body was displayed in a gibbet at Putney Vale.

===Etymology===
The vale part was little-inhabited and known as Kingston Bottom until the middle of the 19th century; the name is featured in a variety of documents dating from 1791 to c. 1850. The Last Will and Testament of one Philip Cawston, dated 26 September 1791, refers to his ownership of the Robin Hood premises in Kingston Bottom; the name also features in maps and wills held by the National Archives dating from 1791 to 1856.

The earliest record of the new name Kingston Vale occurs in the 1861 Census Returns, where the area is referred to as &#x27;Kingston Vale Hamlet&#x27;. By the time of the 1891 Census, the area is described as a &#x27;civil parish, township or place&#x27; under the name of &#x27;Kingston Vale&#x27;. A detailed summary of Kingston of 1848 names the recent new churches and describes the one erected in this neighbourhood as &quot;at Robinhood-Gate&quot;.

===Robin Hood Place Names===
The name of Robin Hood has long been associated with the Kingston Vale area which is close to the Robin Hood Gate of Richmond Park (the name of the gate appearing in records from at least 1785, and a nearby &quot;Robynhood Walke&quot; and &quot;Robyn-hodes Walke&quot; in 1548). Maps of the areas also show Robin Hood Lane and the Robin Hood Inn (later the Robin Hood Pub until it was converted into residential property) as early as 1874. The association with Robin Hood is thought to have arisen from the Robin Hood plays and the May Day Games put on in Richmond Park for the entertainment of Henry VIII.

===The Kingsnympton Park Estate===
The Kingsnympton Park Estate was originally part of &quot;The Knoll&quot;, a large house with extensive grounds along Kingston Hill next to Richmond Park. In 1881 it was the scene of the Kingston Hill Murder. The house was then owned by Harry Powys-Keck of Stoughton Grange, Leicestershire.

In 1914 Mr Crowther built his mansion, &quot;Haygreen&quot;, named after his Yorkshire village and described &quot;as one of the grandest of stately homes that once graced Kingston.&quot; The grounds included a golf course, lakes and Dutch gardens. Haygreen Close is named to remember the connection.

In 1927 Mr F. N. Picket purchased the house and he renamed it &quot;Kingsnympton&quot; after his Dorset village, King&#x27;s Nympton. The pillars on Crescent Road mark the former entrance.

The estate was then owned by Mr Maneckji B. Dadabhoy of Nagpur. He installed the automated wrought iron entrance gates by South Lodge; the roundels have his intertwined initials &quot;MBD&quot;. It was leased for a time by Montague Burton.

The estate was bombed in 1940. The house was demolished and then purchased by the council for housing.

==Transport==

===Road===

Kingston Vale is located north-east of Kingston on the A308; the village straddles both the A308 and the A3 London–Portsmouth Road. The closest junction of the A3 is the Robin Hood Roundabout, which is located at the north-eastern end of the village.

===Bus===
Kingston Vale is served by three local bus routes, connecting the village with New Malden and Tolworth to the south, Kingston and Surbiton to the south-west and Roehampton and Putney to the north-east. The bus routes serving Kingston Vale are as follows:

* 85 – Kingston to Putney, via Norbiton, Kingston Vale and Roehampton
* 265 – Tolworth to Putney, via New Malden, Coombe, Kingston Vale, Roehampton and Barnes
* K3 – Esher to Roehampton Vale, via Claygate, Thames Ditton, Surbiton, Kingston, Norbiton and Kingston Vale

===Rail===
Kingston Vale is not directly accessible by rail; the nearest stations are Norbiton to the south-west, and Putney and Barnes to the north-east. Bus connections are also available within a short walk of the stations at Kingston, New Malden, Surbiton, Tolworth and Barnes.

===Tube===
The nearest Tube station is East Putney station on the District line to the east, with direct bus connections to Kingston Vale on routes 85 and 265. An indirect connection with South Wimbledon station on the Northern line is also possible, via New Malden, Kingston or Roehampton.

==Education==

The vale has its own primary school, the Robin Hood Primary School. The hill hosts Kingston Hill Campus of Kingston University. The Parish Halls play host to a Montessori nursery school and a children&#x27;s dancing school –the Kingston Vale Dance Academy.

==Housing==
The bulk of the housing in Kingston Vale was built by the private sector. Most were built before the 1970s, with many houses along Kingston Hill going back to the 1840s. This older stock is typically ornate, well landscaped in small grounds, with some converted into apartments.
==Politics==
Kingston Vale is within the Parliamentary Constituency of Richmond Park (UK Parliament constituency). This was won by the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 General Election, but has mainly been a Conservative and Liberal Democrat marginal seat since the seat was created in 1997.

==Religious sites==

===St. John the Baptist Anglican church===
The first church in the area was built in 1839 and became the centre of its own Parish in 1847. Its replacement is the Parish Church of St. John the Baptist on Robin Hood Lane. It was consecrated on 22 July 1861, and was completed in 1886 by the addition of the Choir Vestry. It was built on land given by the Duke of Cambridge, using funds donated by Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh (a daughter of George III) and others. It is an Anglican church in the Deanery of Kingston and the Archdiocese of Southwark. In addition to its religious functions, the church acts as a focal point for community activities, such as social clubs, table tennis and space for parties and local associations. Every year the Church holds a summer fete and a fireworks night on varying dates. The Parish Office manages the booking of four halls (three on the site at St. John&#x27;s and the Village Hall).

Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck who, as a resident in White Lodge in Richmond Park, was a frequent worshipper in the church and laid the foundation stone for the North Aisle.

A Pathé newsreel from 1935 shows a society wedding at the church between Leslie Stoll (son of Putney resident Oswald Stoll) and Gertrude Sabey who had met at the nearby riding school.

===St. Ann&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Kingston Hill===
This is a 1960s neo-Georgian brick church with a brick campanile giving it an Italianate touch.

==Culture and recreation==

===Sports===
Kingston Vale is almost surrounded by open spaces, much reflected in the range of local activities; the east of the village/suburbs hosts Stag Lodge Stables, for horse-riding in adjoining Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common. The Richardson Evans Memorial Playing Fields, adjacent to Wimbledon Common, hosts many sporting activities including Saturday/Sunday league football teams, as well as number of annual schools&#x27; rugby and women&#x27;s football tournaments. It is the home ground of London Cornish RFC.

===Community activities===
An active local amenity group, the Kingston Vale Residents Association (KVRA), is a democratic body which deals with matters such as planning, conservation, transport, environment and social. The association&#x27;s newsletter is called the &quot;Bottom Line&quot;, taking its name from the original Middle Ages name of the vale part of the area: &quot;Kingston Bottom&quot;.

Kingston Vale&#x27;s halls are used to host a variety of community activities including an art club, the local theatre group, a coffee club, meetings of the Residents&#x27; Association and many open-door events.

The Kingston Vale Operatic Society (later Kingston Vale Operatic and Dramatic Society) was founded by local residents in 1943. Their first show was Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s Trial by Jury at the Kingston Vale Village Hall in 1943. The group continued operating in the area until the late 2000s when the old village hall was converted to residential property but continues operating in the wider Kingston area.

The village has a self-managed allotment site, which caters to some 60 plot holders from around the Borough and organises a range of social events.

===Museum===
The Dorich House Museum, a museum of sculpture and Imperial Russian art, is run both as a museum and a conference centre by Kingston University.

===Cultural events===
The playing fields host the annual Pongu Tamil event for the London area, a community rally attracting some 30,000 members of the British Tamil community.

<text>The Sword and Sorceress series is a series of fantasy anthologies originally edited by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley, and originally published by DAW Books. As she explained in the foreword to the first volume, she created the anthology to redress the lack of strong female protagonists in the subgenre of sword and sorcery. At the time, most female characters in sword and sorcery were little more than stock damsels in distress, or pawns who were distributed at the conclusion of the story as &quot;bad-conduct prizes&quot; (Bradley&#x27;s term) for the male protagonists. Many of the early sword-and-sorcery works featured attitudes toward women that Bradley considered appalling.

As the &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; series grew in popularity with readers, she began to receive increasing numbers of excellent submissions. As a result, she had to become more selective, and to shorten her reading periods accordingly. For the eighteenth volume, which she was editing at the time of her death, she had enough material for three volumes. After her death, it was decided to take as many as possible of the stories she had tentatively chosen and publish them in three annual volumes, thus extending the series. After volume twenty was published, the publisher decided to extend an invitation for an additional volume under Diana L. Paxson, an editor who had worked with Bradley, with the possibility of additional volumes being published if it became a success.

The &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; series is noteworthy not only for its introduction of strong female protagonists into a subgenre previously dominated by male characters, but for its financial success. Unlike most anthologies of original fantasy short fiction, they routinely earned out their advances and continued to pay their authors royalties for years afterward, often on foreign sales. In addition, many authors who made their first professional sales in the &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; anthologies subsequently enjoyed successful careers as novelists.

In February 2007, the Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Works Trust, which holds her copyrights, negotiated a contract with Norilana Books to publish a new volume and proceed to elicit submissions. The book was published in November, and the editor was Elisabeth Waters. Norilana Books has published four more books of the series, also edited by Elisabeth Waters. From 2012 to 2019 the Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Works Trust published the &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; anthologies.

<text>The pandeiro () is a type of hand frame drum popular in Brazil. The pandeiro is used in a number of Brazilian music forms, such as samba, choro, coco, and capoeira music.

The drumhead is tunable, and the rim holds metal jingles (&quot;platinelas&quot;) which are cupped, creating a crisper, drier and less sustained tone on the pandeiro than on the tambourine. It is held in one hand, and struck on the head by the other hand to produce the sound. Typical pandeiro patterns are played by alternating the thumb, fingertips, heel, and palm of the hand. A pandeiro can also be shaken to make sound, or one can run a finger along the head to produce a drum roll.

==Medieval instrument==
The term &quot;pandeiro&quot; was previously used to describe a square double-skinned frame drum, often with a bell inside; such an instrument is now known by the term &quot;adufe&quot; in Spain and Portugal.

The term &quot;pandeiro&quot; (&quot;pandero&quot; in Asturian) is still used in parts of Galicia, Asturias and Portugal to describe the square-shaped drum, while the round drum with jingles is known as &quot;pandeira&quot; in Galicia and &quot;pandeireta&quot; in Portugal.

==Players==

Some of the best-known pandeiro players today are Paulinho da Costa,  Nanny Assis, Airto Moreira, Marcos Suzano, Cyro Baptista, Zé Maurício, and Carlinhos Pandeiro de Ouro.

Other notable pandeiro players were Scott Feiner, bringing the pandeiro to jazz, and Milt Holland, a Los Angeles–based studio percussionist and drummer who travelled the world extensively to collect and study various ethnic percussion types.
===Non-traditional usage===
Artists such as Stanton Moore use it non-traditionally by tuning it low to sound like a bass drum with jingles, mounting it on a stand and integrating it into the modern drum kit. Others, such as Sule Greg Wilson on the Carolina Chocolate Drops album &quot;Genuine Negro Jig&quot;, use it in tandem with a tunable bodhran—also mounted—and play them as a pair with brushes to create drum kit effects, as well as their original intent as hand-held instruments.

<text>Izjaslav Ingvarevych

Ingvar Yaroslavich (died 1220) was Prince of Dorogobuzh, Prince of Lutsk (1180–1220), Grand Prince of Kiev (1202; 1212), and Prince of Vladimir-Volynsk (1207). He was son of Yaroslav Izyaslavich, great-grandson of Vladimir II Monomakh.

==Reign==
In 1180, Ingvar Yaroslavich joined Ryurik Rostislavich in his struggle against Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich of Chernigov. According to the &quot;Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, Ingvar was &quot;six-winged&quot; and is noted for not acquiring his lands by war. In 1183, for instance, Ingvar refused to accommodate Vladimir II Yaroslavich in Dorogobuzh, who had been banished from Galicia. It appears that Ingvar was wary of Yaroslav Osmomysl, Vladimir Yaroslavich&#x27;s father. Soon after this, Ingvar took the place of his older brother Vsevolod Yaroslavich as the ruler of Lutsk. In 1202, Ingvar was appointed ruler of Kiev instead of the ousted Ryurik Rostislavich in accordance with a deal between Roman Mstislavich of Galicia and Vsevolod the Big Nest, the grand prince of Vladimir. Ryurik, however, would regain Kiev that same year with the help of the Olgovichs and &quot;polovtsy&quot;. In 1204, Ingvar took part in capturing the city of Vladimir-Volynsk together with Alexander of Belz. He was appointed ruler of the city on the spot, but was soon replaced by Alexander due to boyars&#x27; discontent. In 1208–1211, Ingvar sent his son to assist Daniil Romanovich in his struggle against the sons of Igor Sviatoslavich of Novgorod-Seversk. In 1212, Ingvar and Mstislav Romanovich attacked Vsevolod Sviatoslavich and captured Kiev. After a battle near Belgorod, Ingvar voluntarily ceded Kiev to Mstislav Romanovich and left for Lutsk. He died in 1220.

<text>A Bachelor of General Studies or a Bachelor in General Studies (BGS) is a highly interdisciplinary undergraduate academic degree offered by higher education institutions that &quot;allows students to combine and explore multiple subjects.&quot; 

The concept of general studies derives from the medieval European university concept of &quot;studium generale&quot;. A BGS program allows students to design a degree plan with advisors while meeting their academic institution&#x27;s general requirements. Students can typically choose from concentrations in a variety of areas.

The University of Michigan is the only university in the U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking top 50 that offers a Bachelor in General Studies degree program. Despite its name, the Columbia University School of General Studies does not confer Bachelor of General Studies degrees but Bachelor of Arts degrees instead.

<doc id="941206" wikidata="Q722211" url="?curid=941206" title="Mikoyan Project 1.44">
<text>The Mikoyan Project 1.44/1.42 (; NATO reporting name: Flatpack) is a multirole fighter technology demonstrator developed by the Mikoyan design bureau. It was designed for the Soviet Union&#x27;s MFI (&quot;Mnogofunksionalni Frontovoy Istrebitel&quot;, &quot;Multifunctional Frontline Fighter&quot;) project for the I-90 (&quot;1990s fighter&quot;) program, the answer to the U.S.&#x27;s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). The MFI was to incorporate many fifth-generation jet fighter features such as supermaneuverability, supercruise, and advanced avionics, as well as some degree of radar signature reduction.

The design&#x27;s development was a protracted one, characterised by repeated and lengthy postponements due to a chronic lack of funds after the collapse of the Soviet Union; the MiG 1.44 made its maiden flight in February 2000, nine years behind schedule, and was cancelled later that year. The MFI project was replaced by the more modern and affordable PAK FA program, which resulted in the Sukhoi Su-57.

==Development==
===Preliminary design===

The MiG 1.44 had its origins in the early 1980s, when the U.S. Air Force began developing a successor to the F-15 Eagle under the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) project, which would eventually result in the supermaneuverable and stealthy, albeit costly, F-22 Raptor that first flew in 1997. Consequently, the Soviet government tasked its fighter design bureaus the job of developing a fighter with which to counter the perceived American threat, and replace the Sukhoi Su-27. In 1983, the project was formally approved as the I-90 (, ). At this time, the attributes of the next generation of fighter aircraft were still not universally defined; the U.S. pursued a dedicated air superiority fighter with the ATF emphasizing stealth and kinematic performance, whereas the Soviet direction instead focused on &quot;multifunctionality&quot;, or a multirole fighter with exceptional air-to-ground capability, while similarly emphasizing kinematic performance such as supermaneuverability at high angles-of-attack and increased supersonic endurance. Mikoyan occupied itself with two concurrent projects, one of which focused on a heavy multirole design designated MFI, the other a light tactical fighter named LFI (&quot;Lyogkiy Frontovoy Istrebitel&quot;, &quot;Light Frontline Fighter&quot;). To minimise costs, both designs were to share as many components as possible.

However, as the research and development phase for the two projects progressed, costs escalated due to the complexity normally associated with advanced aircraft projects. As a result, the Soviet government created the Combined Task Programme in 1983 with the aim of maximising efficiency and developing technologies to be used for all classes of aircraft. Mikoyan became the primary contractor for the programme, the importance of which was illustrated with its inclusion into the Soviet five-year economic plan. The design bureau soon formulated initial specifications for the new fighters.

Mikoyan proceeded with the preliminary design of both the MFI and LFI with participation from numerous institutions, which assisted in the progressive definition of the designs. TsAGI (&quot;Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut&quot;, &quot;Central Aero- and Hydrodynamic Institute&quot;) was responsible for collecting wind tunnel test results, which, along with theoretical studies, were vital during this phase of development. The institution recommended that Mikoyan include canards for the MFI, since it offers great agility and lift, the latter important as the MFI was a statically unstable design. The delta wings then had a wing leading edge sweep of 40–45°. During this period, engineers undertook wind tunnel testing to refine the MFI&#x27;s aerodynamics and verify its radar cross-section (RCS).

The MFI would have a variable engine intake ramp located under the front fuselage, reminiscent of the Eurofighter Typhoon; this was particularly important with the nature of the aircraft, since it allows for sustained air flow into the engine during sudden manoeuvres. As for the engine themselves, research was conducted on thrust vectoring, allowing for markedly improved maneuverability and short take-off and landing performance. Besides the mechanical and aerodynamic aspects of the design, engineers investigated hundreds of issues to refine the layout and specifications. In 1987, Mikoyan and the associated institutions submitted the MFI and LFI proposals for review.

The MFI production version 1.42 was intended to feature a weapons bay to decrease the radar cross section, however, the technology demonstrator 1.44 was not equipped with one.

===Full-scale development===
While both MFI and LFI designs passed critical review, due to budgetary constraints, Mikoyan shelved the latter to free up funds for the development of the MFI, which had by then been redesignated &quot;Izdeliye&quot; (product) &quot;1.42&quot;. Under the leadership and coordination of Chief Project Engineer Gheogiy A. Sedov, Mikoyan embarked on major design effort. Because the LFI was shelved, 1.42 had by then assumed the multi-role approach, meaning that it had to fulfill both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. TsAGI was still a part of the design effort, having tested radio-controlled models for research into stability and handling characteristics, particularly at high angles of attack. It was later confirmed that the 1.42 is still controllable at angles of attack of up to 60°.

By now the specifications were being firmed. Engineers from various establishments had settled on a definite design, having refined the flight-control software, verified all wind tunnel test results, and checked important systems using test rigs and modified aircraft. In 1988, Mikoyan was issued a specific operational requirement for the 1.42. Three years later, the design passed the Soviet Air Force&#x27;s critical review. This paved the way for the construction of a flyable technology demonstrator, and so Mikoyan issued specifications to specialized factories tasked with such roles.

The technology demonstrator, bearing the designation &quot;1.44&quot;, would be used to verify the aerodynamic layout and flight control system of the design. Construction of it was halfway when the collapse of the Soviet Union brought a halt to further funding. Inevitably the scheduled first flight of the almost-complete aircraft slipped indefinitely. However, full-scale mock-ups and sections of the 1.44 were built in support of static tests, while factories were gearing up for the construction of prototypes. Mikoyan lobbied the government to declassify the project so it could display the aircraft at various air shows. In June 1995, MiG&#x27;s Deputy General Designer Anatoliy Belosvet announced that the prototype could be displayed at that year&#x27;s MAKS Airshow; in the end, the government refused. The company tried in 1997, to no avail.

===Testing and cancellation===

In early 1994, the incomplete aircraft was transported to Zhukovsky Airfield, where it would undertake flight tests. Ground tests began later that year, culminating in the first high-speed runs with Mikoyan&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot Roman Taskayev at the controls. As the test program&#x27;s tempo increased, the programme was postponed as the design bureau did not have sufficient funds to purchase the remaining components still missing on the demonstrator. This would be the main factor in the indefinite postponement of the program for the next few years. In 1997, the Russian government cancelled production of the design due to its unacceptably high unit cost. Mikoyan was financially insecure, resulting with the change in the management during the years leading up to 2000; this opened up other sources of funds. A prospective sale to the Indian Air Force fell through, as Mikoyan demanded extraordinarily high royalty payments of USD 5 billion to set up local production.

The change in the company&#x27;s management also brought many changes. The Russian government revealed the project&#x27;s existence in late 1998. On 24 December 1998, the &quot;Nezavisimaya Gazeta&quot; published a brief article on the fighter, accompanied by several photos. During 1999, final preparations were made for first flight. The aircraft was finally completed. It underwent ground tests, including high-speed taxis during which the aircraft was rotated. On 12 January 1999, the 1.44 was officially rolled out in the presence of top-ranking Russian military and government personnel, international journalists and other dignitaries. Until then, the status of the 1.44 was largely a secret; the previous day, however, &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; published a photo taken from the roof of the hangar in which the demonstrator was parked.

On 29 February 2000, the aircraft performed its first flight at the hands of Vladimir Gorboonov. During the 18-minute flight, the 1.44 reached a maximum height of and reached speeds of . The aircraft touched down at 11:43 am Moscow Time, amid tight security. Gorboonov later described the aircraft as docile. After the 22-minute second flight on 27 April, engineers probably uncovered some problems, since there were no reported flights thereafter. The program has since been cancelled, with the sole prototype known residing at Gromov Flight Research Institute, it was later restored/refurbished and was displayed at MAKS 2015.
==Design==
:&quot;Note: Since the MiG 1.44 did not conduct an extensive flight test program, not all predicted performance aspects were verified. Thus, this section refers to the design as the MiG MFI.&quot;

The MiG MFI was a delta wing, twin-tailed, fifth-generation air superiority/strike fighter design that incorporated advanced technology to theoretically give the aircraft excellent stealth and fighting attributes. It featured a close-coupled canard layout which, when working with the thrust vectoring engine nozzles, gave the aircraft remarkable maneuverability. The aircraft had a tricycle landing gear system, with a single, dual-wheel landing gear in the front, and two single wheels in the rear. The MFI had relaxed stability and was controlled by a fly-by-wire flight control system. Mikoyan made use of weight-saving materials in the construction of the aircraft, with aluminum-lithium alloys making up 35% of the empty weight, steel and titanium alloys (30%), composites (30%) and others (5%).

The MiG MFI was unconventional in its layout, in an effort to improve in-flight efficiency and stealth characteristics. Efforts were made to minimize surface-area, possibly to reduce drag. The wings were of delta planform, with leading-edge sweep at 52°. At the tips were dielectric fairings which housed electronic countermeasures/electronic support measures. The wings had full-span leading-edge flaps. The canards, meanwhile, had a leading-edge sweep of 58°, and had prominent dogtooth which improved airflow over the wings at high alpha (angles of attack). Russian aviation experts claim that the unorthodox design, use of radar-absorbent materials (RAM), and internally mounted weapons, gave a radar cross-section (RCS) of less than , comparable to that of the F-22 Raptor. The RCS falls to with the use of a plasma shield.

Two Lyul&#x27;ka Saturn AL-41F afterburning turbofans produced of thrust, giving the MFI a top speed of Mach 2.35. The engines are variable cycle, which increased supersonic dry thrust and allowed the jet to supercruise at Mach 1.5. The axisymmetrical engines could be vectored in both pitch and yaw planes. The nozzle&#x27;s inner petals were lined with ceramic tiles to reduce infrared signature. The engines, through serpentine ducts covered in RAM, were fed by a double intake ramp with a splitter plate underneath the front fuselage. Weapons and fuel drop tanks could be carried under the wings as well.

The fighter is equipped with a glass cockpit and features a Pulse-Doppler radar. The N014 radar, with a range of and target detection from to , was able to track up to 40 targets and shoot against 20. The radar system has a passive electronically scanned array antenna and is linked to a fire-control system. The 1.42/1.44 fighter is believed to have evolved into the Mikoyan LMFS fifth-generation light fighter project.

Some Russian military analysts believe that the Chinese fifth generation Chengdu J-20 drew heavy inspiration from or was fundamentally based on the MiG 1.44, citing similarities in its canards, tail section, and &quot;duck like&quot; aerodynamic design.

==Variants==
* MiG 1.42: Primary version for production; performance was to be better than that of the 1.44. NATO assigned it the code name &quot;Foxglove&quot;.
* MiG 1.44: Demonstrator prototype with failed upgrades; 1 was built. NATO assigned it the code name &quot;Flatpack&quot;.
* MiG 1.42R: Proposed reconnaissance variant with reconnaissance equipment in the weapons bay.
* MiG 1.42K: Proposed naval variant with folding wings, arrestor hook, strengthened landing gear and enhanced corrosion protection.
* MiG 1.42 trainer: Proposed two-seat trainer variant.

==Specifications (Project 1.42/44)==

&quot;Note: Since the 1.44 and 1.42 never went beyond pre-production, most specifications are estimated.&quot;

<doc id="941221" wikidata="Q1148791" url="?curid=941221" title="Labyrinthulomycetes">
<text>Labyrinthulomycetes (ICNafp) or Labyrinthulea (ICZN) is a class of protists that produce a network of or tubes, which serve as tracks for the cells to glide along and absorb nutrients for them. The two main groups are the labyrinthulids (or slime nets) and thraustochytrids. They are mostly marine, commonly found as parasites on algae and seagrasses or as decomposers on dead plant material. They also include some parasites of marine invertebrates and mixotrophic species that live in a symbiotic relationship with zoochlorella.

== Characteristics ==

Although they are outside the cells, the filaments of Labyrinthulomycetes are surrounded by a membrane. They are formed and connected with the cytoplasm by a unique organelle called a sagenogen or bothrosome. The cells are uninucleated and typically ovoid, and move back and forth along the amorphous network at speeds varying from 5-150 μm per minute. Among the labyrinthulids, the cells are enclosed within the tubes, and among the thraustochytrids, they are attached to their sides.

== Evolution ==
=== Evolutionary origin ===
Labyrinthulomycetes are not fungi, but a monophyletic group of eukaryotes within the Stramenopiles. They belong to the phylum Bigyra, which contains other heterotrophic microorganisms such as the bicosoecids. Considering that the plastids from Stramenopiles are possibly the result of an event of endosymbiosis in their last common ancestor, the bicosoecids and the labyrinthulomycetes could have originated from a mixotrophic algal common ancestor that secondarily lost their plastids.

Some characteristics of the labyrinthulomycetes can be explained by their origin from ancestral plastids. They produce omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids using a desaturase usually present in chloroplasts. The zoospores of labyrinthulids have an eyespot composed of membrane-bound granules that resembles eyespots of photosynthetic stramenopiles, which are either within a plastid or believed to be derived from a plastid.

Within Bigyra, the labyrinthulomycetes are the sister group to Eogyrea, a class containing the species &quot;Pseudophyllomitus vesiculosus&quot; and the environmental clade called MAST-4. Together they compose the subphylum Sagenista.

== Classification ==
Labyrinthulomycetes or Labyrinthulea used to compose the defunct fungal phylum Labyrinthulomycota. They were originally considered unusual slime moulds, although they are not very similar to the other sorts. The structure of their zoospores and genetic studies show them to be a primitive group of heterokonts, but their classification and treatment remains somewhat unsettled.

This class usually contained two orders, Labyrinthulales and Thraustochytriales (ICBN), or Labyrinthulida and Thraustochytrida (ICZN), but a different classification has recently been proposed.

== Genetic code ==
The labyrinthulomycete &quot;Thraustochytrium aureum&quot; is notable for the alternative genetic code of its mitochondria which use as a stop codon instead of coding for Leucine. This code is represented by NCBI translation table 23, &quot;Thraustochytrium&quot; mitochondrial code.

It designs, develops and provides computer hardware as well as related products and services, including laptops, desktops, motherboards, graphics cards, all-in-one PCs, servers, industrial computers, PC peripherals, and car infotainment products, among other products.

The company has a primary listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and was established on August 4, 1986, by five founders – Hsu Hsiang (a.k.a. Joseph Hsu), Huang Chin-Ching (a.k.a. Jeans Huang), Lin Wen-Tung (a.k.a. Frank Lin), Yu Hsien-Neng (a.k.a. Kenny Yu), and Lu Chi-Lung (a.k.a. Henry Lu). 

==Operations==
First starting its business in New Taipei City, Taiwan, MSI later expanded into China, setting up its Bao&#x27;an plant in Shenzhen in 2000 and establishing research and development facilities in Kunshan in 2001. It also provides global warranty service in North America, Central/South America, Asia, Australia and Europe.

MSI&#x27;s offices in Zhonghe District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, serve as the company&#x27;s headquarters, and house a number of different divisions and services.

Manufacturing initially took place at plants in Taiwan, but has been moved elsewhere. Many MSI graphics cards are manufactured at its plant in mainland China.

The company has branch offices in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia and South Africa. As of 2015, the company has a global presence in over 120 countries.

MSI and Syrma SGS announced their collaboration to make laptops in Chennai on January 10, 2025. MSI will transfer technology to Syrma SGS for localized production in India. 

==Products==
The company first built its reputation on developing and manufacturing computer motherboards and graphics cards. It established its subsidiary FUNTORO in 2008 for the vehicle infotainment market. It provides many computer and tech oriented products including laptops, desktops, monitors, motherboards, graphics cards, power supply products, computer cases and liquid cooler for gamers and content creators, all-in-one PCs, mobile workstations, servers, IPCs, multimedia peripherals, vehicle infotainment, and an autonomous mobility robot.

In early 2016, MSI announced a collaboration with HTC and has revealed Vive-ready systems to offer Virtual Reality experiences.

==History==
MSI&#x27;s five founders Joseph Hsu, Jeans Huang, Frank Lin, Kenny Yu and Henry Lu all worked for Sony before establishing MSI. Sony&#x27;s corporate downsizing in 1985 brought them together. With the engineering background working for Sony, they established Micro Star International together in August 1986.

In 1997, MSI inaugurated Plant I in Zhonghe, followed by the opening of Plant III in Zhonghe in 2000. In the same year, MSI Computer (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. was established, and in 2001, MSI Electronics (Kunshan) Co., Ltd. was founded. In 2002, MSI set up its European logistics center in the Netherlands. The company went public in 1998 with an IPO on the Taipei Stock Exchange (TAIEX).

In 2015, Laptop magazine ranked MSI the fourth-best laptop brand of the year, and according to Topology Research Institute, MSI was the largest gaming laptop supplier worldwide in 2016. MSI had also been awarded the Taiwan Excellence award for 15 consecutive years in 2013. In August 2018, MSI was rated the Best Gaming Laptop Brand of 2018 by Laptop Mag. New designs of its GS65 Stealth Thin and GE63 Raider RGB laptops earned the company an 84 out of 100 and put it on the top spot.

On 7 October 2020, MSI released a public statement about their subsidiary Starlit scalping MSI-made Nvidia RTX 3080 and 3090 GPUs, and selling them for higher than MSRP on eBay.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, MSI refused to withdraw from the Russian market. Research by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of Yale University put MSI in the Yale CELI List of Companies category of &quot;Digging In - Defying Demands for Exit or Reduction of Activities&quot;, the only Taiwanese company in the database. MSI issued a statement on March 28, 2022, claiming that it abides by all international regulations in terms of its sales and operations in Russia.

At Computex 2023, MSI revealed a collaboration with Mercedes-AMG for a special edition of its Alpha 17 gaming laptop. This limited-edition model features design elements inspired by the AMG performance brand, integrating the aesthetics and luxury of Mercedes-AMG with high-performance gaming hardware. The partnership emphasizes both brands&#x27; focus on speed, precision, and cutting-edge technology.

In 2024, MSI Gaming Arena hosted a Dota 2 e-sports tournament in Southeast Asia. Teams were chosen through regional qualifiers for the online playoffs, which were scheduled from September 27 to October 6.

The Discovery documentary &quot;Esports: The Rise of the New King&quot; examines the rapid transformation of gaming into a prominent sport, premiering in August 2023.

These servers are designed to enhance AI, data processing, and cloud computing capabilities. The new platforms highlight MSI&#x27;s focus on scalability and advanced technology for high-performance computing environments.

<doc id="941270" wikidata="Q14438" url="?curid=941270" title="Giganotosaurus">
<text>Giganotosaurus ( ) is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now Argentina, during the early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 99.6 to 95 million years ago. The holotype specimen was discovered in the Candeleros Formation of Patagonia in 1993 and is almost 70% complete. The animal was named Giganotosaurus carolinii in 1995; the genus name translates to &quot;giant southern lizard&quot;, and the specific name honors the discoverer, Ruben Carolini. A dentary bone, a tooth, and some tracks, discovered before the holotype, were later assigned to this animal. The genus attracted much interest and became part of a scientific debate about the maximum sizes of theropod dinosaurs.

&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was one of the largest known terrestrial carnivores, but the exact size has been hard to determine due to the incompleteness of the remains found so far. Estimates for the most complete specimen range from a length of , a skull in length, and a weight of . The dentary bone that belonged to a supposedly larger individual has been used to extrapolate a length of . Some researchers have found the animal to be larger than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which has historically been considered the largest theropod, while others have found them to be roughly equal in size and the largest size estimates for &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; exaggerated. The skull was low, with rugose (rough and wrinkled) nasal bones and a ridge-like crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The front of the lower jaw was flattened and had a downward-projecting process (or &quot;chin&quot;) at the tip. The teeth were compressed sideways and had serrations. The neck was strong and the pectoral girdle proportionally small.

Part of the family Carcharodontosauridae, &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; is one of the most completely known members of the group, which includes other very large theropods, such as the closely related &quot;Mapusaurus&quot;, &quot;Tyrannotitan&quot; and &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;. &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; is thought to have been homeothermic (a type of &quot;warm-bloodedness&quot;), with a metabolism between that of a mammal and a reptile, which would have enabled fast growth. It would have been capable of closing its jaws quickly, capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites. The &quot;chin&quot; may have helped in resisting stress when a bite was delivered against prey. &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; is thought to have been the apex predator of its ecosystem, and it may have fed on juvenile sauropod dinosaurs.

==Discovery==

In 1993, the amateur Argentine fossil hunter discovered the tibia (lower leg bone) of a theropod dinosaur while driving a dune buggy in the badlands near Villa El Chocón, in the Neuquén province of Patagonia, Argentina. Specialists from the National University of Comahue were sent to excavate the specimen after being notified of the find. The discovery was announced by the paleontologists Rodolfo Coria and Leonardo Salgado at a Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in 1994, where science writer Don Lessem offered to fund the excavation, after having been impressed by a photo of the leg-bone. The partial skull was scattered over an area of about 10 m2 (110 sq ft), and the postcranial skeleton was disarticulated. The specimen preserved almost 70% of the skeleton, and included most of the vertebral column, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, the femora, and the left tibia and fibula.

In 1995, this specimen was preliminarily described by Coria and Salgado, who made it the holotype of the new genus and species &quot;Giganotosaurus carolinii&quot; (parts of the skeleton were still encased in plaster at this time). The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;gigas/&quot; (meaning &quot;giant&quot;), &quot;notos/&quot; (meaning &quot;austral/southern&quot;, in reference to its provenance) and &quot;-sauros/-&quot; (meaning &quot;lizard&quot;). The specific name honors Carolini, the discoverer. The holotype skeleton is now housed in the Ernesto Bachmann Paleontological Museum (where it is catalogued as specimen MUCPv-Ch1) in Villa El Chocón, which was inaugurated in 1995 at the request of Carolini. The specimen is the main exhibition at the museum, and is placed on the sandy floor of a room devoted to the animal, along with tools used by paleontologists during the excavation. A mounted reconstruction of the skeleton is exhibited in an adjacent room.
One of the features of theropod dinosaurs that has attracted most scientific interest is the fact that the group includes the largest terrestrial predators of the Mesozoic Era. This interest began with the discovery of one of the first known dinosaurs, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, named in 1824 for its large size. More than half a century later in 1905, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was named, and it remained the largest known theropod dinosaur for 90 years, though other large theropods were also known. The discussion of which theropod was the largest was revived in the 1990s by new discoveries in Africa and South America. In their original description, Coria and Salgado considered &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; at least the largest theropod dinosaur from the southern hemisphere, and perhaps the largest in the world. They conceded that comparison with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was difficult due to the disarticulated state of the cranial bones of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, but noted that at , the femur of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was 5 cm (2 in) longer than that of &quot;Sue&quot;, the largest known &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen, and that the bones of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; appeared to be more robust, indicating a heavier animal. They estimated the skull to have been about 1.53 m (5 ft) long, and the whole animal to have been 12.5 m (41 ft) long, with a weight of about .

In 1996, the paleontologist Paul Sereno and colleagues described a new skull of the related genus &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; from Morocco, a theropod described in 1927 but previously known only from fragmentary remains (much of its fossils were destroyed in World War II). They estimated the skull to have been long, similar to &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, but perhaps exceeding that of the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; &quot;Sue&quot;, with a 1.53 m (5 ft) long skull. They also pointed out that carcharodontosaurs appear to have had the proportionally largest skulls, but that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; appears to have had longer hind limbs. In an interview for a 1995 article entitled &quot;new beast usurps &quot;T. rex&quot; as king carnivore&quot;, Sereno noted that these newly discovered theropods from South America and Africa competed with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; as the largest predators, and would help in the understanding of Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas, which had otherwise been very &quot;North America-centric&quot;. In the same issue of the journal in which &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; was described, the paleontologist Philip J. Currie cautioned that it was yet to be determined which of the two animals were larger, and that the size of an animal is less interesting to paleontologists than, for example, adaptations, relationships, and distribution. He also found it remarkable that the two animals were found within a year of each other, and were closely related, in spite of being found on different continents.
In a 1997 interview, Coria estimated &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; to have been 13.7 (45 ft) to 14.3 (47 ft) m long and weighing based on new material, larger than &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;. Sereno countered that it would be difficult to determine a size range for a species based on few, incomplete specimens, and both paleontologists agreed that other aspects of these dinosaurs were more important than settling the &quot;size contest&quot;. In 1998, the paleontologist Jorge O. Calvo and Coria assigned a partial left dentary bone (part of the lower jaw) containing some teeth (MUCPv-95) to &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;. It had been collected by Calvo near Los Candeleros in 1988 (found in 1987), who described it briefly in 1989, while noting it may have belonged to a new theropod taxon. Calvo and Coria found the dentary to be identical to that of the holotype, though 8% larger at 62 cm (24 in). Though the rear part of it is incomplete, they proposed that the skull of the holotype specimen would have been long, and estimated the skull of the larger specimen to have been long, the longest skull of any theropod.

In 1999, Calvo referred an incomplete tooth, (MUCPv-52), to &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;; this specimen was discovered near Lake Ezequiel Ramos Mexia in 1987 by A. Delgado, and is therefore the first known fossil of the genus. Calvo further suggested that some theropod trackways and isolated tracks (which he made the basis of the ichnotaxon &quot;Abelichnus astigarrae&quot; in 1991) belonged to &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, based on their large size. The largest tracks are long with a pace of , and the smallest is long with a pace of . The tracks are tridactyl (three-toed) and have large and coarse digits, with prominent claw impressions. Impressions of the digits occupy most of the track-length, and one track has a thin heel. Though the tracks were found in a higher stratigraphic level than the main fossils of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, they were from the same strata as the single tooth and some sauropod dinosaurs that are also known from the same strata as &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;.

===Continued size estimations===

In 2001, the physician-scientist Frank Seebacher proposed a new polynomial method of calculating body-mass estimates for dinosaurs (using body-length, depth, and width), and found &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; to have weighed (based on the original length estimate). In their 2002 description of the braincase of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, Coria and Currie gave a length estimate of for the holotype skull, and calculated a weight of by extrapolating from the circumference of the femur-shaft. This resulted in an encephalization quotient (a measure of relative brain size) of 1.9. In 2004, the paleontologist Gerardo V. Mazzetta and colleagues pointed out that though the femur of the &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; holotype was larger than that of &quot;Sue&quot;, the tibia was shorter at . They found the holotype specimen to have been equal to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in size at (marginally smaller than &quot;Sue&quot;), but that the larger dentary might have represented an animal of , if geometrically similar to the holotype specimen. By using multivariate regression equations, these authors also suggested an alternative weight of for the holotype and for the larger specimen, and that the latter was therefore the largest known terrestrial carnivore.
In 2005, the paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso and colleagues described new skull material (a snout) of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; (the original fossils of which were also destroyed during World War II), and concluded this dinosaur would have been long with a weight , exceeding the maximum size of all other theropods. In 2006, Coria and Currie described the large theropod &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; from Patagonia; it was closely related to &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and of approximately the same size. In 2007, the paleontologists François Therrien and Donald M. Henderson found that &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; would have approached in length and in weight, while &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; would have approached in length and in weight (surpassing &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;), and estimated the &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; holotype skull to have been long. They cautioned that these measurements depended on whether the incomplete skulls of these animals had been reconstructed correctly, and that more complete specimens were needed for more accurate estimates. They also found that Dal Sasso and colleagues&#x27; reconstruction of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was too large, and instead estimated it to have been long, weighing , and possibly as low as in length and in weight. They concluded that these dinosaurs had reached the upper biomechanical size limit attainable by a strictly bipedal animal. In 2010, the paleontologist Gregory S. Paul suggested that the skulls of carcharodontosaurs had been reconstructed as too long in general.

In 2012, the paleontologist Matthew T. Carrano and colleagues noted that though &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; had received much attention due to its enormous size, and in spite of the holotype being relatively complete, it had not yet been described in detail, apart from the braincase. They pointed out that many contacts between skull bones were not preserved, which lead to the total length of the skull being ambiguous. They found instead that the skulls of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; were exactly the same size as that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. They also measured the femur of the &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; holotype to be long, in contrast to the original measurement, and proposed that the body mass would have been smaller overall. In 2013, the paleontologist Scott Hartman published a Graphic Double Integration mass estimate (based on drawn skeletal reconstructions) on his blog, wherein he found &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; (&quot;Sue&quot;) to have been larger than &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; overall. He estimated the &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; holotype to have weighed , and the larger specimen . &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was estimated to have weighed , and Hartman noted that it had a wider torso, though the two seemed similar in side view. He also pointed out that the &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; dentary that was supposedly 8% larger than that of the holotype specimen would rather have been 6.5% larger, or could simply have belonged to a similarly sized animal with a more robust dentary. He conceded that with only one good &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; specimen known, it is possible that larger individuals will be found, as it took most of a century to find &quot;Sue&quot; after &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was discovered.
In 2014, the paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim and colleagues estimated the length of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; to have been over , by extrapolating from a new specimen scaled up to match the snout described by Dal Sasso and colleagues. This would make &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; the largest known carnivorous dinosaur. In 2019, the paleontologist W. Scott Persons and colleagues described a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen (nicknamed &quot;Scotty&quot;), and estimated it to be more massive than other giant theropods, but cautioned that the femoral proportions of the carcharodontosaurids &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannotitan&quot; indicated a body mass larger than other adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. They noted that these theropods were known by far fewer specimens than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and that future finds may reveal specimens larger than &quot;Scotty&quot;, as indicated by the large &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; dentary. While &quot;Scotty&quot; had the greatest femoral circumference, the femoral length of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was about 10% longer, but the authors stated it was difficult to compare proportions between large theropod clades.

In 2021, the paleontologist Matías Reolid and colleagues compiled various mass estimates of theropods (including &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;) to calculate the average, but did not include Therrien and Henderson&#x27;s 2007 estimates of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, considering them outliers. This resulted in a body mass range for &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; between , with an average of . They also applied the skull length and body length ratio proposed by Therrien and Henderson and reconstructed various digital 3D models of theropods to measure body mass distribution and volume, resulting in the mass of a long &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; up to . These researchers found the estimates consistent with the values proposed by previous studies. In 2022, Juan I. Canale and colleagues described the large carcharodontosaurid &quot;Meraxes&quot;, which has the most completely known Carcharodontosaurine skull, with an estimated length of . Extrapolating from that skull, they estimated the skull of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; to have been long, making it one of the largest known theropod skulls. Henderson suggested in 2023 that there was a close relation between the dimensions of the pelvic area and body size in theropods, allowing size estimates for incomplete specimens. Based on this idea, he found &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; to have been long, identical to the estimate proposed in the 1995 description.

==Description==
&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; is thought to have been one of the largest theropod dinosaurs, but the incompleteness of its remains have made it difficult to estimate its size reliably. It is therefore impossible to determine with certainty whether it was larger than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, for example, which has been considered the largest theropod historically. Different size estimates have been reached by several researchers, based on various methods, and depending on how the missing parts of the skeleton have been reconstructed. Length estimates for the holotype specimen have varied between , with a skull between long, a femur (thigh bone) between long, and a weight between . Fusion of sutures (joints) in the braincase indicates the holotype specimen was a mature individual. A second specimen, consisting of a dentary bone from a supposedly larger individual, has been used to extrapolate a length of , a skull long, and a weight of . Some writers have considered the largest size estimates for both specimens exaggerated. &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; has been compared to an oversized version of the well-known genus &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

===Skull===
Though incompletely known, the skull of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; appears to have been low. The maxilla of the upper jaw had a long tooth row, was deep from top to bottom, and its upper and lower edges were almost parallel. The maxilla had a pronounced process (projection) under the nostril, and a small, ellipse-shaped fenestra (opening), as in &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The nasal bone was very rugose (rough and wrinkled), and these rugosities continued backwards, covering the entire upper surface of this bone. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye had a prominent, rugose crest (or horn) that pointed up at a backwards angle. The crest was ridge-like, and had deep grooves. The postorbital bone behind the eye had a down and backwards directed jugal process that projected into the orbit (eye opening), as seen in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Abelisaurus&quot;, and &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;. The supraorbital bone above the eye that contacted between the lacrimal and postorbital bones was eave-like, and similar to that of &quot;Abelisaurus&quot;. The quadrate bone at the back of the skull was long, and had two pneumatic (air-filled) foramina (holes) on the inner side.

The skull roof (formed by the frontal and parietal bones) was broad and formed a &quot;shelf&quot;, which overhung the short supratemporal fenestrae at the top rear of the skull. The jaw articulated far behind the occipital condyle (where the neck is attached to the skull) compared to other theropods. The condyle was broad and low, and had pneumatic cavities. &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; did not have a sagittal crest on the top of the skull, and the jaw muscles did not extend onto the skull roof, unlike in most other theropods (due to the shelf over the supratemporal fenestrae). These muscles would instead have been attached to the lower side surfaces of the shelf. The neck muscles that elevated the head would have attached to the prominent supraoccipital bones on the top of the skull, which functioned like the nuchal crest of tyrannosaurs. A latex endocast of the brain cavity of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; showed that the brain was similar to that of the related genus &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, but larger. The endocast was long, wide, and had a volume of .

The dentary of the lower jaw expanded in height towards the front (by the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the lower jaw connected), where it was also flattened, and it had a downwards projection at the tip (which has been referred to as a &quot;chin&quot;). The lower side of the dentary was concave, the outer side was convex in upper view, and a groove ran along it, which supported foramina that nourished the teeth. The inner side of the dentary had a row of interdental plates, where each tooth had a foramen. The Meckelian groove ran along the lower border. The curvature of the dentary shows that the mouth of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; would have been wide. It is possible that each dentary had twelve alveoli (tooth sockets). Most of the alveoli were about 3.5 cm (1.3 in) long from front to back. The teeth of the dentary were of similar shape and size, except for the first one, which was smaller. The teeth were compressed sideways, were oval in cross-section, and had serrations at the front and back borders, which is typical of theropods. The teeth were sigmoid-shaped when seen in front and back view. One tooth had nine to twelve serrations per mm (0.039 in). The side teeth of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; had curved ridges of enamel, and the largest teeth in the premaxilla (front of the upper jaw) had pronounced wrinkles (with their highest relief near the serrations).

===Postcranial skeleton===

The neck of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was strong, and the axis bone (the neck vertebra that articulates with the skull) was robust. The rear neck (cervical) vertebrae had short, flattened centra (the &quot;bodies&quot; of the vertebrae), with almost hemispherical articulations (contacts) at the front, and pleurocoels (hollow depressions) divided by laminae (plates). The back (dorsal) vertebrae had high neural arches and deep pleurocoels. The tail (caudal) vertebrae had neural spines that were elongated from front to back and had robust centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae were long from front to back, and the chevrons on the front were blade-like. The pectoral girdle was proportionally shorter than that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, with the ratio between the scapula (shoulder blade) and the femur being less than 0.5. The blade of the scapula had parallel borders, and a strong tubercle for insertion of the triceps muscle. The coracoid was small and hook-shaped.

The ilium of the pelvis had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a projection where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter at the front than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.

==Classification==

Coria and Salgado originally found &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; to group more closely with the theropod clade Tetanurae than to more basal (or &quot;primitive&quot;) theropods such as ceratosaurs, due to shared features (synapomorphies) in the legs, skull, and pelvis. Other features showed that it was outside the more derived (or &quot;advanced&quot;) clade Coelurosauria. In 1996, Sereno and colleagues found &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; to be closely related within the superfamily Allosauroidea, and grouped them in the family Carcharodontosauridae. Features shared between these genera include the lacrimal and postorbital bones forming a broad &quot;shelf&quot; over the orbit, and the squared front end of the lower jaw.

As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became clearer. The group was defined as all allosauroids closer to Carcharodontosaurus than &quot;Allosaurus&quot; or &quot;Sinraptor&quot; by the paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues in 2004. In 2006, Coria and Currie united &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; in the carcharodontosaurid subfamily Giganotosaurinae based on shared features of the femur, such as a weak fourth trochanter, and a shallow, broad groove on the lower end. In 2008, Sereno and the paleontologist Stephen L. Brusatte united &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, &quot;Mapusaurus&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannotitan&quot; in the tribe Giganotosaurini. In 2010, Paul listed &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; as &quot;&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; (or &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;) &quot;carolinii&quot;&quot; without elaboration. &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; is one of the most complete and informative members of Carcharodontosauridae.
 
The following cladogram shows the placement of Giganotosaurus within Carcharodontosauridae according the paleontologist Andrea Cau, 2024:

===Evolution===
Coria and Salgado suggested that the convergent evolution of gigantism in theropods could have been linked to common conditions in their environments or ecosystems. Sereno and colleagues found that the presence of carcharodontosaurids in Africa (&quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;), North America (&quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;), and South America (&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;), showed the group had a transcontinental distribution by the Early Cretaceous period. Dispersal routes between the northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in the Late Cretaceous, which led to more distinct, provincial faunas, by preventing exchange. Previously, it was thought that the Cretaceous world was biogeographically separated, with the northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids, South America by abelisaurids, and Africa by carcharodontosaurids. The subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae, in which &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; belongs, appears to have been restricted to the southern continent of Gondwana (formed by South America and Africa), where they were probably the apex (top) predators. The South American tribe Giganotosaurini may have been separated from their African relatives through vicariance, when Gondwana broke up during the Aptian–Albian ages of the Early Cretaceous.

==Paleobiology==
In 1999, the paleontologist Reese E. Barrick and the geologist William J. Showers found that the bones of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had very similar oxygen isotope patterns, with similar heat distribution in the body. These thermoregulatory patterns indicate that these dinosaurs had a metabolism intermediate between that of mammals and reptiles, and were therefore homeothermic (with a stable core body-temperature, a type of &quot;warm-bloodedness&quot;). The metabolism of an &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; would be comparable to that of a mammalian carnivore, and would have supported rapid growth.

In 2001, the physicist Rudemar Ernesto Blanco and Mazzetta evaluated the cursorial (running) capability of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;. They rejected the hypothesis by James O. Farlow that the risk of injuries involved in such large animals falling while on a run, would limit the speed of large theropods. Instead they posed that the imbalance caused by increasing velocity would be the limiting factor. Calculating the time it would take for a leg to gain balance after the retraction of the opposite leg, they found the upper kinematic limit of the running speed to be . They also found comparison between the running capability of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and birds like the ostrich based on the strength of their leg-bones to be of limited value, since theropods, unlike birds, had heavy tails to counterbalance their weight.

A 2017 biomechanical study of the running ability of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; by the biologist William I. Sellers and colleagues suggested that skeletal loads were too great to have allowed adult individuals to run. The relatively long limbs, which were long argued to indicate good running ability, would instead have mechanically limited it to walking gaits, and it would therefore not have been a high-speed pursuit predator. They suggested that these findings would also apply to other long-limbed giant theropods such as &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, &quot;Mapusaurus&quot;, and &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;.

===Feeding===
In 2002, Coria and Currie found that various features of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; would have had a good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.

In 2005 Therrien and colleagues estimated the relative bite force of theropods and found that &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and related taxa had adaptations for capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites, whereas tyrannosaurs had adaptations for resisting torsional stress and crushing bones. Estimates in absolute values like newtons were impossible. The bite force of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was weaker than that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and the force decreased hindwards along the tooth row. The lower jaws were adapted for slicing bites, and it probably captured and manipulated prey with the front part of the jaws. These authors suggested that &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and other allosaurs may have been generalized predators that fed on a wide spectrum of prey smaller than themselves, such as juvenile sauropods. The ventral process (or &quot;chin&quot;) of the lower jaw may have been an adaptation for resisting tensile stress when the powerful bite was delivered with the front of the jaws against the prey.

The first known fossils of the closely related &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; were found in a bonebed consisting of several individuals at different growth stages. In their 2006 description of the genus, Coria and Currie suggested that though this could be due to a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses, the presence of different growth stages of the same taxon indicated the aggregation was not coincidental. In a 2006 &quot;National Geographic&quot; article, Coria stated that the bonebed was probably the result of a catastrophic event and that the presence of mainly medium-sized individuals, with very few young or old, is normal for animals that form packs. Therefore, Coria said, large theropods may have hunted in groups, which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods.

==Paleoenvironment==
&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was discovered in the Candeleros Formation, which was deposited during the Early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 99.6 to 97 million years ago. This formation is the lowest unit in the Neuquén Group, wherein it is part of the Río Limay Subgroup. The formation is composed of coarse and medium-grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment (associated with rivers and streams), and in aeolian conditions (effected by wind). Paleosols (buried soil), siltstones, and claystones are present, some of which represent swamp conditions.

&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was probably the apex predator in its ecosystem. It shared its environment with herbivorous dinosaurs such as the titanosaurian sauropod &quot;Andesaurus&quot;, and the rebbachisaurid sauropods &quot;Limaysaurus&quot; and &quot;Nopcsaspondylus&quot;. Other theropods include the abelisaurid &quot;Ekrixinatosaurus&quot;, the dromaeosaurid &quot;Buitreraptor&quot;, and the alvarezsauroid &quot;Alnashetri&quot;. Other reptiles include the crocodyliform &quot;Araripesuchus&quot;, sphenodontians, snakes, and the turtle &quot;Prochelidella&quot;. Other vertebrates include cladotherian mammals, a pipoid frog, and ceratodontiform fishes. Footprints indicate the presence of large ornithopods and pterosaurs as well.

<doc id="941367" wikidata="Q767702" url="?curid=941367" title="Gigantosaurus">
<text>Gigantosaurus () is a dubious genus of Sauropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Formation of England. The type species, &quot;Gigantosaurus megalonyx&quot;, was named and described by Harry Govier Seeley in 1869. 

== History ==
Its syntype series consists of several separately discovered sauropod bones found in Cambridgeshire in 1862, including two caudal (tail) vertebrae (CAMSM J.29477 and CAMSM J.29478), the distal end of a tibia (CAMSM J.29483), a cast of the right radius (CAMSM J.29482), a cast of phalanx (CAMSM J.29479) and an osteoderm (CAMSM J.29481). 

It was synonymised to &quot;Ornithopsis humerocristatus&quot; by Richard Lydekker in 1888 and to &quot;Pelorosaurus&quot; by Friedrich von Huene in 1909. Today it is considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. 
Because of these references Eberhard Fraas incorrectly assumed in 1908, the name was available for other species and he used it, despite it being preoccupied, for African material totally unrelated to the British finds. As a result, the name &quot;Gigantosaurus&quot; factored into the convoluted taxonomic history of the dinosaurs &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tornieria&quot;, and &quot;Janenschia&quot;. A discussion of this can be found in the main &quot;Tornieria&quot; article.

<doc id="941431" wikidata="Q1378050" url="?curid=941431" title="Pop Will Eat Itself">
<text>Pop Will Eat Itself are an English alternative rock band formed in 1986 in Stourbridge in the West Midlands of England with members from Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country. Initially known as a grebo act, they changed style to incorporate sample-driven indie and industrial rock. Graham Crabb describes their sound as &quot;electronic, punk, alternative hip-hop, hybrid music for fucking, fighting &amp; smoking cigars&quot;. Their highest-charting single was the 1993 top-ten hit &quot;Get the Girl! Kill the Baddies!&quot;. After initially disbanding in 1996, and having a brief reformation in 2005, they issued their first release in more than five years in 2010.

==Career==
===Early years: 1981–1988===
An early permutation of the band formed in 1981 under the name From Eden. Members included Clint Mansell, Adam Mole, Chris Fradgley, Malcolm Treece and Miles Hunt (Treece and Hunt went on to form The Wonder Stuff). From Eden recruited Graham Crabb from &#x27;Kit-Form Colossus&#x27; to replace Hunt on drums before splitting up.

Crabb, Mole and Mansell recruited Richard March and changed their band name to Wild and Wandering (known locally as Blind and Blundering because they always performed in an intoxicated state). The name came from a Wasted Youth album under which one E.P. was released (&quot;2,000 Light Ales from Home&quot; on Iguana Records) before eventually becoming Pop Will Eat Itself in 1986. The new name was taken from a quotation in an &quot;NME&quot; article on Jamie Wednesday by David Quantick.

====First single: &quot;Poppies Say Grrr!&quot; and tour====
In 1986, the band released the &quot;Poppies Say Grrr!&quot; single, which became Single of the Week in the &quot;NME&quot; and played by Janice Long on BBC Radio 1 and in the Midlands by John Slater on BRMB. The single was sold in a brown paper bag and was made available for sale at Martin Newsagents in Stourbridge High Street as well as from the home of one of the band.

With their new-found popularity, the band set off on a six-week tour of Europe, often encountering hostility at the set length being less than half an hour, even though this comprised around 16 tracks: all the band had.

====Influences====
During this time the band was listening to more hip hop (Run DMC, Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys) as well as music from a new emerging movement of sample-heavy dance records (The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu, MARRS, S&#x27;Express and Bomb the Bass).

After hearing Robert Gordon&#x27;s remix of their cover of Sigue Sigue Sputnik&#x27;s &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot; and Age of Chance&#x27;s mini-LP &quot;Crush Collision&quot; (also engineered by Gordon), the band glimpsed their future as hip-hop/dance/rock music pioneers and decided to record their debut album &quot;Box Frenzy&quot; with Gordon at Sheffield&#x27;s FON studios in June/July 1987. It was here the band met The Designers Republic, which was to be the start of a very successful partnership. The album came out on manager Craig Jennings&#x27; Chapter 22 label. &#x27;CJ&#x27; still manages the band to the present day, along with the roster at his firm, Raw Power Management.

The transition from punky guitar music to incorporating state-of-the-art production and new musical territories was not dissimilar to a path previously trodden by one of the band&#x27;s musical heroes The Clash and subsequently Big Audio Dynamite. The album surprised the band&#x27;s fans and perplexed the music critics. Crabb, now more immersed in sample-finding and songwriting, moved from behind the drum kit to being a co-vocalist with Mansell and was replaced by a drum machine called Dr. Nightmare. March took on programming duties and became the band expert on all things Atari and Akai. &quot;Beaver Patrol&quot;, a cover of the Wilde Knights song, (suggested to the band by Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream), caused some controversy for its offensive lyrics but &quot;There Is No Love Between Us Anymore&quot; made the lower reaches of the UK charts and as a result, PWEI were signed to the record label RCA. Whilst much confusion ensued around the dramatic change of direction, PWEI secured a first by being the first Western independent band to be invited to play the then-Soviet Union.

====Chart success====
The band achieved Top 40 hits with &quot;Can U Dig It?&quot; and &quot;Wise Up! Sucker&quot; from their album, &quot;This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This!&quot; In late 1988 PWEI were invited by Rush Management to support Run DMC on their European tour. Main support act Public Enemy were becoming increasingly popular and had a large and militant following who booed off all support acts, in particular, PWEI, who agreed to leave the tour when the situation deteriorated in Amsterdam.

===The RCA years: 1989–1993===
They released three albums on RCA. The first two (&quot;…This is This!&quot; and &quot;Cure for Sanity&quot;) were recorded with the aid of Flood, known for his work with Nine Inch Nails, U2 and Depeche Mode. The band toured extensively in the UK, Europe, and US, including appearances at Reading Festival. Their singles charted progressively higher, with every single release charting inside the UK Top Forty from 1990 until their final single release in 1994.

On 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Looks or the Lifestyle?&quot; the band recruited John &quot;Fuzz&quot; Townshend as their drummer to complement their pre-programmed drums. The band had discussed adding a live drummer in 1990, but touring commitments made it impractical to do so until the band were able to break touring activity in late 1991 to commence recording. The album peaked at UK No. 15 and featured the Top 30 hit singles &quot;Karmadrome&quot; and &quot;Bulletproof!&quot; Despite healthy sales and widescale touring the band&#x27;s biggest supporters at RCA had left the company by January 1993 and the remaining executives did not understand the band or their music, suggesting at one meeting that EMF &#x27;write a hit&#x27; for them. The band was dropped from the label before the &quot;Get the Girl! Kill the Baddies!&quot; single was released. It went on to peak at number 9 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band&#x27;s biggest hit and making the band at that time the highest charting act to appear on Top of the Pops without a record deal. In an attempt to recoup their investment, the label released a live album &quot;Live at Weird&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot; recorded in London in October 1992.

===Industrial influence: 1994–1995===

PWEI&#x27;s political stance became more explicit with the release of the single &quot;Ich Bin Ein Auslander&quot;. A collaboration with Asian group Fun-Da-Mental, the song had anti-Nazi styled lyrics and reached the UK Top 30. A different version of this song later appeared as the opening track on the 1994 album, &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot;. The album peaked at No. 11 in the UK Albums Chart and spawned their then final single release, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Cool&quot;, which became their ninth Top 30 UK hit. The band also collaborated with The Prodigy on the track &quot;Their Law&quot;, featured in their breakthrough second album &quot;Music For The Jilted Generation&quot;. This track also had political content, serving as a protest against Great Britain&#x27;s Criminal Justice And Public order Act 1994, which had criminalised rave culture.

The band found some new popularity after signing with Trent Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Records in the US, and touring with Nine Inch Nails, as well as having their songs used on the PlayStation game &quot;Loaded&quot;. In March 1995 the band released the &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot; remix album &quot;Two Fingers My Friends!&quot; which featured remixes by The Orb, Apollo 440 and Renegade Soundwave. Crabb left the band in 1995 - originally proposing to contribute in a non-touring capacity due to fatherhood - but the band replaced him with Kerry Hammond on guitar and backing vocals, with Mansell taking over full vocal duties. The band decided to split in May 1996 (with 12 songs recorded and mixed in a state of near completion), and toured the UK briefly in June 1996 with a final live show at Roskilde. At this point, their set contained several unreleased songs from the unfinished album. Two tracks from this period were released at the time, a cover version of Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot;, released on the 1997 tribute album &quot;Random&quot;, and an instrumental track called &quot;Zero Return&quot; on a magazine sampler. In 2013, the songs from the unfinished album were assembled into a bonus disc with the reissue of &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot;, comprising the &#x27;unreleased 1996 album&#x27;, now titled &quot;A Lick of the Old Cassette Box&quot;.

===Disbanded: 1996===
Crabb concentrated on his ambient side project Golden Claw Musics. After the rest of the band split in 1996, March and Townshend went on to form the big beat band Bentley Rhythm Ace. Townshend also released two solo albums and Mansell wrote film scores, including &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, &quot;π&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;The Fountain&quot;, &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;, and &quot;Black Swan&quot;.

===Reformation: 2005===
The band reformed to play their first gigs in eight years, in Nottingham, Birmingham, and London in January 2005. These gigs were notable for their Instant Live albums, whereby ten minutes after the completion of each gig, double live albums of the performance could be purchased.

The band released a preview of new material called &quot;Sonic Noise Byte&quot; on 4 November 2005, as a torrent download for members of their official website pweination. However, an announcement on the official website in March 2006 confirmed that Mansell and March would no longer be involved in the project due to other work commitments, effectively ending the PWEI reformation. The remaining band members continued as Vileevils, and released the tracks &quot;Retro Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Street Fightin&quot; for download via the pweination website.

A secret, one-night PWEI reunion was scheduled to happen at the Vileevils show at Stourbridge Rock Cafe on 9 June 2007, but was foiled when Mansell was unable to obtain a visa in time to fly back to the UK. March still appeared at the show, and after the Vileevils set they played the planned PWEI songs, without Mansell.

Vileevils performed their final live date in December 2008 supporting Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin, before recording an unreleased album, which was cancelled prior to release in 2010. Some songs from this record were re-recorded for the 2011 Pop Will Eat Itself album &quot;New Noise Designed By A Sadist&quot;.

===New PWEI: 2011–present===

In July 2011, a new line-up was announced, featuring Graham Crabb (as the only original member), fellow vocalist Mary Byker (Gaye Bykers on Acid, Apollo 440, Pigface), guitarist Tim Muddiman (Gary Numan), drummer Jason Bowld (Pitchshifter, Killing Joke) and bassist Davey Bennett (This Burning Age). 
That October the album &quot;New Noise Designed by a Sadist&quot; was released on Cooking Vinyl, produced by Monti &amp; Rob Holliday (Sulpher, The Prodigy) and was followed by a UK tour. The band further toured in March and December 2012. 
The single &quot;Disguise&quot; was featured as Radio 6 Breakfast Show &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; and an instrumental &quot;Back to Business&quot; was used on Top Gear. Crabb &amp; Byker also guested on Soccer AM. The band began working on a remix album to complement &quot;New Noise Designed by a Sadist&quot;, but this project was discontinued in favour of the &quot;Watch the Bitch Blow&quot; EP. They toured the UK in December 2013 as one third of a triple bill featuring The Wonder Stuff and Jesus Jones.

The &quot;Watch the Bitch Blow&quot; EP was released in March 2014, through PledgeMusic, and the &quot;Reclaim the Game (Funk FIFA)&quot; single featuring Brazilian rapper BNegão (Planet Hemp) followed in June 2014 for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as a protest song against FIFA. The album &quot;Anti-Nasty League&quot; was planned for release in September–October, but was delayed to fit in with the band&#x27;s live schedule in 2015. It was released exclusively and independently through the band&#x27;s shop: shop.popwilleatitself.net in April 2015. A 9-date UK tour was undertaken in May. In May, the band signed a publishing administration deal with Bucks Music Group for the ANL album only.

On 26 August 2016, PWEI headlined the opening day of Infest, with Fuzz Townshend rejoining on drums. Over the following years, they continued playing occasional concerts in the UK, with line-ups varying between shows to agree with the availability of the band members. In addition to Townshend, former band members Richard March and Adam Mole rejoined the band, resulting in a near original line-up by 2018.

Seven years after its original release, &quot;Anti-Nasty League&quot; was made available digitally on the band&#x27;s official store and major music streaming and download services. Two months later, in June 2022, a new single, &quot;The Poppies Strike Back&quot;, was released. A second, &quot;Chihuahua&quot;, followed in September. It was the first new music to be released by the band since 2015&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Nasty League&quot; aside from a 2018 box set compilation which included several unreleased remixes and a rough demo.

==Vestan Pance==
All PWEI songs were credited to Vestan Pance. It was a pseudonym for the band as a whole. Although the songs were mainly Crabb or Mansell compositions, using a pseudonym was considered more interesting than just &quot;All songs by Pop Will Eat Itself&quot;. When Townshend joined the band, an attempt to change the name to &#x27;Vestan Pance and Socks&#x27; was denied by RCA.

<text>Ram FM was an Independent Local Radio station, which broadcast to central and southern parts of Derbyshire on 102.8 FM. The station merged with two other East Midlands stations, Trent FM and Leicester Sound to form Capital FM East Midlands (part of Global&#x27;s Capital FM Network) on Monday 3 January 2011.

==History==

After a period of test transmissions, the station began life as &quot;Radio Trent 945&quot; at 6:00am on Tuesday 3 March 1987 on 102.8FM, also broadcasting on AM 945 kHz. Andy Marriott launched the station with a recording of a message from His Grace the Duke of Devonshire. The first song played was Simply Red – Do The Right Thing.

In October 1988, the AM frequency was launched as a separate oldies service called GEM AM; that service also continues today now known as Gold.

In March 1994, the FM service was rebranded &quot;Ram FM&quot; by new owners GWR Group plc, and continued to broadcast from studios under the Assembly Rooms in Derby Market Place. The station moved premises in 1999 to offices at Norwich Union House on nearby Iron Gate.

Ram FM broadcast its very last local programme on Friday 31 December 2010 ahead of the station&#x27;s merger with Trent FM and Leicester Sound to form Capital FM East Midlands as part of Global Radio&#x27;s launch of The Capital FM Network. The new station officially began broadcasting at 10am on Monday 3 January 2011. Former Ram FM weekday breakfast presenters Dean &#x27;Dino&#x27; Weatherbed &amp; Pete Allen presented weekday drivetime shows for the regional station before becoming presenters of &quot;Capital Breakfast with Dino &amp; Pete&quot; in April 2012.

<text>Steve Gibbons (born 13 July 1941) is an English singer-songwriter, guitarist and bandleader. His music career spans more than 50 years.

== Career ==
=== The Dominettes ===
Steve Gibbons started his professional life as a plumber&#x27;s apprentice in Harborne. He joined the Dominettes in 1958, to replace Colin Smith, who had left to join Jimmy Powell&#x27;s backing group. Colin Smith later changed his name to Carl Barron and became the singer with The Cheetahs. An Elvis Presley fan, Gibbons&#x27; first performance with The Dominettes was at The California public house near Weoley Castle.

Regular music venues for The Dominettes in the early 1960s were the Grotto Club on Bromsgrove Street, and The Sicilia Coffee Bar in Edgbaston. The group by this time included many R&amp;B numbers into their set and this style of music suited Gibbons&#x27; gritty vocals. Although the Dominettes had a rougher image than most groups at that time, and were sometimes hired to back strippers at some of the more seedy establishments, they attracted quite a following. Another regular venue for the Dominettes was the Firebird Jazz Club on Carrs Lane in central Birmingham and the group posted advertisements which read &quot;anything considered&quot;.

=== The Ugly&#x27;s ===
By 1963, The Dominettes were renamed The Ugly&#x27;s. Eventually, the Ugly&#x27;s were able to secure a recording contract with Pye Records and the first release from the group in 1965 was an original song entitled &quot;Wake Up My Mind&quot;, composed by Burnet, Holden and Gibbons. The single was advanced for its time and featured some socially conscious lyrics – very unlike the kind of material produced by most other pop groups of the period. The record did not sell well in the United Kingdom, but was a big hit on the national Australian chart, reaching No. 14. John Gordon left in 1965, and was replaced by Jimmy O&#x27;Neill from a local band called The Yamps (he had also spent some time with The Walker Brothers). A second Ugly&#x27;s single released the same year was &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. This one featured prominent use of a harpsichord, as played by O&#x27;Neill. The record fell short of the UK Singles Chart, despite the group&#x27;s appearance on the television program, &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; to promote it.

Other Ugly&#x27;s singles were released between 1965 and 1967 including a cover version of &quot;End of the Season&quot;, a song composed by Ray Davies. This represented a departure from the Ugly&#x27;s&#x27; previous records, as they had all been group compositions up to that point.

During this period, there were many personnel changes in the Ugly&#x27;s line-up which included the departure of Bob Burnett and John Hustwayte. Bass guitarist Dave Pegg joined for a year before leaving to join the Ian Campbell Group. He was replaced by Dave Morgan from a local band called Blaises, and had also been a former member of Danny King&#x27;s Mayfair Set. Dave Pegg was later in a local group called The Exception and from there, he joined Fairport Convention. Dave Morgan also composed the song &quot;Something&quot; which ended up as the b-side of the Move&#x27;s chart-topping &quot;Blackberry Way&quot; single. Jimmy O&#x27;Neill left the Ugly&#x27;s in 1968 to join The Mindbenders and founding member Jim Holden also departed later that year.

Former Brumbeats guitarist Roger Hill (1 January 1945, Erdington, Birmingham – 8 November 2011, Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield) joined the Ugly&#x27;s and stayed for almost a year, before leaving to join previously departed Dave Pegg in forming a new band called The Exception. Roger Hill was replaced by Will Hammond (from The Yamps) who stayed in the Ugly&#x27;s line-up until the end. Jim Holden was replaced by drummer Keith Smart from Danny King&#x27;s Mayfair Set. Keyboard player Richard Tandy, who also played on the Move&#x27;s &quot;Blackberry Way&quot;, joined in 1968 and eventually joined the Electric Light Orchestra.

By the end of 1968, Gibbons was the only remaining original member of The Ugly&#x27;s. This final line-up also included Will Hammond, Dave Morgan, Keith Smart, and Richard Tandy. They recorded a projected single &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen The Light&quot; which was never released.

=== Balls ===
Gibbons teamed up with guitarist Trevor Burton from The Move in 1969 and, by April of that year, they had formed a new group called Balls, along with singer/guitarist Denny Laine (formerly of the Moody Blues), and Ugly&#x27;s&#x27; drummer Keith Smart. The project was relatively short lived and after recording a solo album, Gibbons left the band in February 1971.

=== Idle Race ===
After the breakup of Balls, Gibbons returned to Birmingham from London to join The Idle Race for three months in 1971. This band rapidly evolved into the Steve Gibbons Band.

=== Steve Gibbons Band ===

The first line-up comprised Gibbons together with Dave Carroll and Bob Wilson on guitars, Bob Griffin on bass who was replaced in 1972 by Trevor Burton and Bob Lamb on drums. The new band worked the pub and club circuits until 1975 when they were spotted by Peter Meaden, former manager of the Who. This led to the Steve Gibbons Band joining the Who&#x27;s management stable and recording their first Polydor album &quot;Any Road Up&quot; in 1975 (With John Entwistle of the Who playing on a few tracks). This was followed in 1976 by a tour with the Who in the UK, Europe and the United States. Playing the concert arenas, they shared the stage with Little Feat, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Electric Light Orchestra, The J. Geils Band, Rufus, and Nils Lofgren. In 1977 their second album, &quot;Rollin&#x27; On&quot; included their biggest hit single, &quot;Tulane&quot;, a cover of a Chuck Berry song, produced by Kenny Laguna. The single reached No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart and spent eight weeks in the Top 40. They performed the song live on Show 4, of Marc Bolan&#x27;s TV series &quot;Marc&quot;, broadcast on 14 September., 1977. 1977 also saw the release of the live album &quot;Caught in the Act&quot;. This band lineup made one further studio album with Polydor, &quot;Down in the Bunker&quot; (1978), produced by Tony Visconti. Steve made his last album with Polydor &quot;Street Parade&quot; (1980) this had a different band lineup after the breakup of the original band. Only Trevor Burton remained from the original lineup, with Robbie Blunt on guitar and Harry Rix on drums.

In 1981, after a further change in personnel, Trevor Burton now on guitar, PJ Wright guitar, Derek Wood bass and Alan &quot;Sticky&quot; Wickett drums, Steve Gibbons Band recorded &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; for RCA, and later responded to an invitation from the German Democratic Republic to become one of the first western rock bands to tour the major cities of East Germany in 1982. Gibbons played at the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986 which featured George Harrison. Nine more albums were released in the 1980s and 1990s, and the touring continued.

=== The Dylan Project ===
Gibbons formed the Dylan Project in the late 1990s. The trio covered Bob Dylan songs and played material by Gibbons.

=== Brum Rocks ===
Gibbons continues to tour with his band, and is also a member of the hit UK show &#x27;Brum Rocks Live&#x27;, along with Bev Bevan (The Move, ELO), Trevor Burton (The Move), Danny King, and writer Laurie Hornsby. The show toured the UK, and was produced and promoted by Brian Yeates Associates.

Gibbons lives with his wife Suzie in Edgbaston, Birmingham. They have two sons and a daughter.

Gibbons played in concert for the Newlife Foundation for Disabled Children in February 2011.

<doc id="941475" wikidata="Q4348008" url="?curid=941475" title="Mad Season (Matchbox Twenty album)">
<text>Mad Season is the second studio album by American rock band Matchbox Twenty. It was released on May 23, 2000, by Atlantic Records.

==Recording and release==
The album was a significant departure from the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Yourself or Someone Like You&quot;, as it moved from a straight rock sound to poppier sounds and experimental rock. &quot;Mad Season&quot;″s sound is grander and more innovative than the band&#x27;s previous album, as it includes orchestra and horn sections. While not as successful as its predecessor, the album entered and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 365,000 and was certified 4× Platinum in the United States in October 2001.

<doc id="941481" wikidata="Q4718450" url="?curid=941481" title="Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh">
<text>Alexander Hugh Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh, (13 January 1849 – 6 July 1921) was a Scottish Unionist politician, banker and statesman, who took a leading part in the affairs of the Church of Scotland. He was Secretary for Scotland between 1895 and 1903.

==Background==
The son of Robert Bruce, at one time Tory Member of Parliament for Clackmannan, he was born in Kennet in that county and educated at Loretto, Eton and Oriel College, Oxford. In 1868, four years after his death, Robert Bruce&#x27;s claim to the peerage was recognised by the House of Lords, and so his son became sixth Lord Balfour of Burleigh on the reversal of the title&#x27;s attainder by Act of Parliament in 1869.

==Political career==

In 1876 Balfour was elected a Scottish representative peer. Six years later, he was made an Education Commissioner for Scotland, and in 1887 he entered Lord Salisbury&#x27;s administration as a Lord-in-waiting. The following year, Lord Balfour became Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, a position he held until the Liberals returned to power in 1892, and for three years he chaired the London Water Supply Commission until his return to government as Secretary for Scotland in 1895. 
On 4 February 1903, Balfour opened the new purpose-built Leith Nautical College.

Balfour was appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1901. Balfour resigned office in 1903 with the split that occurred in the Conservative and Unionist Party over Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s campaign for tariff reform, a campaign which he opposed.

==Banking career==
Balfour was Governor of the Bank of Scotland from 1904 to 1921.

==Other public appointments==
Balfour was appointed Lord Rector of Edinburgh University (1896–1899), and elected Chancellor of St Andrews University in 1900, a post he held until his death. An active figure in the Church of Scotland, he was President of the World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh in 1910, and was an important negotiator in the discussions on church union in Scotland which came to fruition in the 1920s. In 1916 he was appointed as chairman of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy by Lloyd George and the economisers in the Cabinet in acknowledgement of his free trade credentials. In 1917 he was appointed convener of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland. He became Lord Warden of the Stannaries in Cornwall and a member of the Council of the Prince of Wales in 1908.

==Honours==
In June 1901 he received the honorary degree Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow, and later the same year he received the Freedom of the City of Glasgow &quot;″for his services in facilitation legislation for the city″&quot;. The following May, he was at Carnavon to receive the honorary degree LL.D. (Legum Doctor) from the University of Wales during the ceremony to install the Prince of Wales (later King George V) as Chancellor of that university. In July 1902, he received the freedom of the city of St Andrews, &quot;″in testimony of his great services to the Scottish nation in many capacities, and especially of the conspicuous abilities with which he had discharged the onerous duties of Secretary for Scotland, and the deep interest he had shown in the cause of education and in promoting the welfare of the country.″&quot;

He was appointed a Knight of the Thistle (KT) in March 1901, and invested by King Edward at Marlborough House on 18 March 1901.
He was appointed a GCMG in 1911, and GCVO in 1917.

==History of Presbyterianism==
Balfour wrote &quot;An Historical Account of the Rise and Development of Presbyterianism in Scotland&quot;, published in 1911 by the Cambridge University Press as part of their series &quot;Cambridge manuals of science and literature&quot;.

==Family==
Balfour married Lady Katherine Eliza, youngest daughter of the George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen, in 1876. They had two sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Robert Bruce, Master of Burleigh, was killed in the First World War. After his death the heir to the lordship transferred to his second son, George John Gordon Bruce, 7th Lord Balfour of Burleigh (1883–1967). 

His eldest daughter, Hon. Mary Bruce, OBE, married Sir John Augustus Hope, 16th Baronet Hope of Craighall. His younger daughter, Hon Victoria Alexandrina Katherine Bruce, had a career in the prison service and was the first woman Governor of a prison in Scotland. 

Lord Burleigh of Balfour died at Cadogan Square, London, in July 1921, aged 72. He was buried in Clackmannan Churchyard. Lady Balfour of Burleigh died in February 1931, aged 78.

<doc id="941482" wikidata="Q313005" url="?curid=941482" title="Sigurd the Crusader">
<text>Sigurd the Crusader (; ; 1089 – 26 March 1130), also known as Sigurd Magnusson and Sigurd I, was King of Norway from 1103 to 1130. His rule, together with his half-brother Øystein (until Øystein died in 1123), has been regarded by historians as a golden age for the medieval Kingdom of Norway. He is otherwise famous for leading the Norwegian Crusade (1107–1110), earning him the eponym &quot;the Crusader&quot;, and was the first European king to participate in a crusade personally.

==Early life==
Sigurd was one of the three sons of King Magnus III, the other two being Øystein and Olaf. They were all illegitimate sons of the king with different mothers. The three half-brothers co-ruled the kingdom from 1103 to avoid feuds or war. Sigurd ruled alone after Olaf died in 1115 and Øystein in 1123.

Before being proclaimed King of Norway, Sigurd was styled as King of the Isles and Earl of Orkney. Neither Øystein nor Olav received such prestigious titles. Sigurd passed the Earldom of Orkney on to Haakon Paulsson.

Many historians have viewed Sigurd and Øystein&#x27;s rule as a golden age for the medieval Kingdom of Norway. The state flourished economically and culturally, allowing Sigurd to participate in the Crusades and gain international recognition and prestige.

== Expedition with Magnus III ==

In 1098, Sigurd accompanied his father, King Magnus III, on his expedition to the Orkney Islands, Hebrides and the Irish Sea. He was made Earl of Orkney the same year, following the swift removal of the incumbent earls of Orkney, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. He was also apparently made King of the Isles in that same year, following the overthrow of their king by his father, Magnus. Although Magnus was not directly responsible for the death of the previous king of the Isles, he became the kingdom&#x27;s next ruler, most likely due to his conquest of the islands. This was the first time the kingdom had been under the direct control of a Norwegian king. It is uncertain whether Sigurd returned home with his father to Norway after the 1098 expedition. However, it is known that he was in Orkney when Magnus returned west in 1102 for his next expedition. While there, a marriage alliance was negotiated between Magnus and Muircheartach Ua Briain. He proclaimed himself High King of Ireland, as he was one of the most powerful rulers in Ireland, as well as the ruler of Dublin. Sigurd was to marry Muirchertach&#x27;s daughter Bjaðmunjo, a young Irish princess and, for a short period, queen. The marriage might not even have been consummated.

When King Magnus was ambushed and killed in Ulaid by an Irish army in 1103, the 14-year-old Sigurd returned to Norway along with the rest of the Norwegian army, leaving his child-bride behind. Upon arriving in Norway, he and his two brothers, Øystein and Olav, were proclaimed kings of Norway and jointly ruled the kingdom together for some time. The expeditions conducted by Magnus were somewhat profitable to the Kingdom of Norway, as the many islands under Norwegian control generated wealth and a workforce. However the Hebrides and Man quickly re-asserted their independence after Magnus&#x27; death.

== Norwegian Crusade ==
In 1107, Sigurd led the Norwegian Crusade to support the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been founded after the First Crusade. He was the first European king to personally lead a crusade, and his feats earned him the nickname &quot;Jorsalafari&quot;. Sigurd possessed a total force of about 5000 men in about 60 ships, as recorded by the sagas. The two kings, Øystein and Sigurd, initially debated who should lead the contingent and remain home to rule the kingdom. Sigurd was eventually chosen to lead the crusade, possibly because he was a more experienced traveler, having been on several expeditions with his father, Magnus III, to Ireland and islands in the seas around Scotland.

Sigurd fought in Lisbon, various Mediterranean islands and Palestine. He often fought the enemies amongst his loyal soldiers and relatives; they were continually victorious and vastly successful, gaining considerable amounts of treasure and booty. However, the loot probably never reached Norway, as Sigurd left almost everything he had gained in Constantinople. On his way to Jerusalem (&quot;Jorsala&quot;) he visited the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in his castle at Palermo.

Upon arriving in the Holy Land, he was greeted by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem. He received a warm welcome and spent a lot of time with the king. The two kings rode to the Jordan River, where Sigurd might have been baptized. King Baldwin asked Sigurd to join him and Ordelafo Faliero, Doge of Venice, in the capture of the coastal city of Sidon, which had been re-fortified by the Fatimids in 1098. The Siege of Sidon was a great success for the crusaders, and the city was conquered on 5 December 1110. Eustace Grenier was granted the Lordship of Sidon after the city was captured. By order of Baldwin and the patriarch of Jerusalem, Ghibbelin of Arles, a splinter was taken from the True Cross and given to Sigurd after the siege as a token of friendship and as a relic for his heroic participation in the crusades. Thereafter, King Sigurd returned to his ships and prepared to leave the Holy Land. They sailed north to the island of Cyprus, where Sigurd stayed for a time. Sigurd then sailed to Constantinople (&quot;Miklagard&quot;) and entered the city through the gate called the Gold Tower, riding in front of his men. He stayed there for a while, meeting and spending much time with Emperor Alexios I Komnenos.

== Return to Norway ==
Before leaving Constantinople, Sigurd gave all of his ships and many treasures away to Emperor Alexios. In return, the emperor gave him many strong horses for him and his fellow relatives. Sigurd planned to return to Norway over land, but many of his men stayed behind in Constantinople to serve the emperor as part of his Varangian Guard. The trip took three years, and he visited many countries en route. Sigurd traveled from Serbia and Bulgaria through Hungary, Pannonia, Swabia, and Bavaria, where he met with the Emperor Lothar II of the Holy Roman Empire. He later arrived in Denmark, where he was greeted by King Niels of Denmark, who eventually gave him a ship to sail to Norway.

Upon returning to Norway in 1111, Sigurd returned to a flourishing and prosperous kingdom. King Øystein had created a solid and stable country, and the church gained wealth, power, and prestige. During Sigurd&#x27;s reign, the tithe (a 10% tax to support the church) was introduced in Norway, which significantly strengthened the church in the country. Sigurd founded the diocese of Stavanger. He had been denied a divorce by the bishop in Bergen, so he installed another bishop further south and had him perform the divorce.

Sigurd made his capital in Konghelle (in the vicinity of Kungälv in present-day Sweden) and built a strong castle there. He also kept the relic given to him by King Baldwin, a splinter reputed to be from the True Cross. In 1123, Sigurd once again set out to fight in the name of the church, this time in the Swedish Crusade to Småland in Sweden. The inhabitants had reportedly renounced Christianity and were again worshiping Old Norse deities.

== Death ==
According to the kings&#x27; sagas &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Sigurd experienced manifestations of mental illness in the years before his death. He died in 1130 and was buried in Hallvard&#x27;s church (&quot;Hallvardskirken&quot;) in Oslo. Sigurd was married to Malmfred, a daughter of Grand Prince Mstislav I of Kiev and granddaughter of King Inge I of Sweden. They had a daughter, Kristin Sigurdsdatter. 
He left no legitimate sons. Magnus, his illegitimate son with Borghild Olavsdotter, became king of Norway. He shared the throne in an uneasy peace with another claimant, Harald Gille. This led to a power struggle following Sigurd&#x27;s death between various illegitimate sons and other royal pretenders, which escalated into a lengthy and devastating civil war. This gave rise to long feuds over who should rule the Kingdom of Norway in the 12th century and early 13th century.

==Primary sources==
Most of the information gathered about the life of Sigurd and his brothers is taken from the Heimskringla, written by Snorri Sturluson around 1225, and the kings&#x27; saga Morkinskinna. Scholars still debate the historical veracity of these works. Sigurd is also mentioned in various European sources.

== In theatrical works and poetry ==
In the 19th century, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson wrote a historical drama based on the life of the king, with incidental music (titled &quot;Sigurd Jorsalfar&quot;) composed by Edvard Grieg. The Scottish poet William Forsyth wrote &#x27;King Sigurd the Crusader&#x27;, illustrated by Edward Burne-Jones in 1862.

<doc id="941491" wikidata="Q3372869" url="?curid=941491" title="Seventh-inning stretch">
<text>In baseball in the United States and Canada, the seventh-inning stretch (also known as the Lucky 7 in Japan and South Korea) is a long-standing tradition that takes place between the halves of the seventh inning of a game. Fans generally stand up and stretch out their arms and legs and sometimes walk around. It is a popular time to get a late-game snack or an alcoholic beverage, as alcohol sales often cease after the last out of the seventh inning. The stretch also serves as a short break for the players.

Most ballparks in professional baseball mark this point of the game by playing the crowd sing-along song &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. If a game goes into a fifth extra inning, a similar &quot;fourteenth-inning stretch&quot; is celebrated (as well as, in theory, a possible &quot;twenty-first-inning stretch&quot;, an &quot;twenty-eighth-inning stretch&quot;, or even a &quot;thirty-fifth-inning stretch&quot;). In softball games, amateur baseball games scheduled for only seven innings (little league plays usually six), or in minor-league doubleheaders, a &quot;fifth-inning stretch&quot; may be substituted.

In Japan, the seventh-inning stretch consists of two parts: one after the end of the 6th inning, where the away team&#x27;s fight song is played, as fans are encouraged to sing along. The second part is after the top of the 7th inning, when the home team&#x27;s fight song is played. Every team has a unique fight song that is played regardless of where they play on a given day.

==Origin==

The origin of the seventh-inning stretch tradition is much disputed, and it is difficult to certify any definite history.

One claimant is Brother Jasper (Brennan) of Mary, F.S.C., the man credited with bringing baseball to Manhattan University in New York City. Being the Prefect of Discipline as well as the coach of the team, it fell to Brother Jasper to supervise the student fans at every home game. On one particularly hot and muggy day in June 1882, during the seventh inning against a semi-pro team called the Metropolitans, the Prefect noticed his charges becoming restless. To break the tension, he called a timeout in the game and instructed everyone in the bleachers to stand up and unwind. It worked so well he began calling for a seventh-inning rest period at every game. The Manhattan University custom spread to the major leagues after the New York Giants were charmed by it at an exhibition game.

In June 1869 the &quot;New York Herald&quot; published a report on a game between the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Brooklyn Eagles (home team): &quot;At the close of the long second inning, the laughable stand up and stretch was indulged in all round the field.&quot;

Whether a stretch was observed nationwide is not known, but later in 1869 the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot; reported on a game that was played on the West Coast between the Red Stockings and the Eagle Club of San Francisco: &quot;One thing noticeable in this game was a ten minutes&#x27; intermission at the end of the sixth inning – a dodge to advertise and have the crowd patronize the bar.&quot;

However, a letter written in 1869 by Harry Wright (1835–1895), manager of the Cincinnati Red Stockings documented something very similar to a seventh-inning stretch, making the following observation about the Cincinnati fans&#x27; ballpark behavior: &quot;The spectators all arise between halves of the seventh inning, extend their legs and arms and sometimes walk about. In so doing they enjoy the relief afforded by relaxation from a long posture upon hard benches.&quot; Another tale holds that the stretch was invented by a manager stalling for time to warm up a relief pitcher.

On October 18, 1889, Game 1 of the 1889 World Series saw a seventh-inning stretch after somebody yelled &quot;stretch for luck&quot;.

A popular story for the origin of the seventh-inning stretch is that on April 14, 1910, on opening day, , , President William Howard Taft was sore from prolonged sitting at a game between the Washington Senators and the Philadelphia Athletics and stood up to stretch, causing the crowd to feel obligated to join their president in his gestures. This story is set at a far later date than the others, however, so he may only have given the presidential seal of approval to a longstanding tradition; the story that his physical problems forced him to stand up contradict this, but he might have just been waiting for the proper accepted time to relieve his pain; either way, he gave national publicity to the practice.

As to the name, there appears to be no written record of the name &quot;seventh-inning stretch&quot; before 1920, which since at least the late 1870s was called the Lucky Seventh, indicating that the 7th inning was settled on for superstitious reasons.

==Current practice==
In modern baseball, standing up and singing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch is a popular tradition. It was first played at a ballpark at a high school in Los Angeles, California in 1934. The composers, Jack Norworth (1879–1959) (lyrics) and Albert Von Tilzer (1878–1956) (music), had both never attended an actual baseball game prior to writing this popular song. Norworth only attended his first Major League game much later in 1940.

There is no certain date when the tradition began, but the practice gained exceptional popularity from broadcaster Harry Caray. Caray would sing the song to himself in the broadcast booth during the stretch while a play-by-play announcer for the Chicago White Sox. After hearing him sing one day, White Sox owner Bill Veeck Jr., the famed baseball promoter, had Caray&#x27;s microphone turned on so that the ballpark could hear him sing. When Caray moved into the Chicago Cubs broadcast booth, he continued the practice, sparking what has become a Cubs tradition by regularly leading the crowd in singing the song in every seventh-inning stretch. Since his death, the Cubs have invited various celebrities to lead the crowd during the stretch, including James Belushi, John Cusack, Mike Ditka, Michael J. Fox, Bill Murray, Dan Patrick, Ozzy Osbourne, Eddie Vedder, C.M. Punk, Mr. T and Billy Corgan.

==Team traditions==

Many teams will also play a local traditional song either before or after &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. Since 1975, the Baltimore Orioles have often played the raucous John Denver song &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot; at the conclusion of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. During the bridge of the song, in which Denver holds a long note, fans yell &quot;Ooooooooh!&quot; (since the name &quot;Orioles&quot; is often shortened to &quot;O&#x27;s&quot;.) The Atlanta Braves also play this song after &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;.

Jane Jarvis, the organist at the New York Mets&#x27; home Shea Stadium from 1964 to 1979, played the &quot;Mexican Hat Dance&quot; during the stretch. After the Mets switched to recorded music, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; became standard. In recent decades, the Lou Monte tune &quot;Lazy Mary&quot; has followed it, a practice that has continued since the team&#x27;s move to Citi Field.

When the St. Louis Cardinals were owned by Anheuser-Busch, Busch Memorial Stadium organist Ernie Hays played &quot;Here Comes the King&quot;, a commonly recognized jingle for Budweiser beer, during the stretch. On Opening Day, during playoff games and on &quot;big nights&quot; such as games against the Chicago Cubs, a team of Budweiser&#x27;s mascot Clydesdale horses would also make a circuit of the warning track. Since Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s sale of the Cardinals in 1996, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; has been played in the middle of the 7th inning, with &quot;Here Comes The King&quot; at the top of the 8th. Often, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; is followed by an instrumental rendition of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis&quot;. The Clydesdales still appear on Opening Day and during the playoffs. The tradition remained upon moving to Busch Stadium in 2006.

The Toronto Blue Jays take the term &quot;seventh-inning &quot;stretch&quot;&quot; literally, as Health Canada officials lead fans at Rogers Centre in stretching exercises while the club&#x27;s song &quot;OK Blue Jays&quot; plays before &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;.

The Miami Marlins, attempting to mimic the Blue Jays&#x27; exercising song in their inaugural year of 1993, created a group of dancers, some former University of Miami Sunsations or Miami Heat dancers, and called the group &quot;The Seventh Inning Stretchers&quot;. At the first game this group came onto the field at the top of the 7th inning, and the crowd was encouraged to stand and stretch, and do a choreographed dance to Gloria Estefan&#x27;s song &quot;Get on Your Feet&quot;. The crowd, thinking it was the actual 7th-inning stretch, booed loudly. The group appeared at a second game the following evening, but was booed again and was never seen following that game.

The Texas Rangers initially played only &quot;Cotton-Eyed Joe&quot; during the 7th-inning stretch. When the team moved to their new facility in 1994, The Ballpark in Arlington (now Choctaw Stadium), &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; was added to 7th-inning stretch, followed by &quot;Cotton-Eyed Joe&quot;. Somewhat unusual for a 7th-inning stretch song, the version of &quot;Cotton-Eyed Joe&quot; played is an instrumental, by Al Dean from the album &quot;Plays for Urban Cowboys&quot;. Rather than singing along, the crowd claps along and stomps their feet to the tune. They kept the tradition upon moving to Globe Life Field in 2020.

Although the New York Yankees play &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; during the seventh-Inning Stretch, it is preceded by &quot;God Bless America&quot; ever since the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.

The Minnesota Twins play &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; by Prince, due to the tradition that rookies and newly traded players know the lyrics to the song.

Other clubs that traditionally play songs after &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; include: Cincinnati Reds (&quot;Cincinnati, Ohio (song)&quot; – Connie Smith), Milwaukee Brewers (&quot;The Beer Barrel Polka&quot; – in reference to the city&#x27;s beermaking heritage), Houston Astros (&quot;Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot;), Los Angeles Angels (&quot;Good 4 U&quot; by Olivia Rodrigo), Seattle Mariners (&quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us&quot; by Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis), the Colorado Rockies (a cover version of &quot;Hey! Baby&quot;), the Pittsburgh Pirates (&quot;We Are Fam-a-lee a homage to the slogan used in the 1979 season) and Washington Nationals (&quot;Take On Me&quot; by A-ha, a song that became popular with Nationals fans during the 2012 season when Michael Morse used it as his walk-up music).

===8th inning traditions===
Many teams have 8th inning traditions as well. In 2020 and 2021, when MLB began to shorten doubleheader games to 7 innings, the traditions continued for doubleheaders only if the games proceed to an 8th inning (marking extra innings).

While all thirty Major League franchises currently sing the traditional &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; in the seventh inning, several other teams will sing their local favorite between the top and bottom of the eighth inning. Boston Red Sox fans at Fenway Park, for example, sing along to Neil Diamond&#x27;s recording of &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot;. A notable occurrence happened in June 2011 when during the playing of the song, the city&#x27;s NHL franchise, the Boston Bruins, captured the Stanley Cup following a 7-game series against the Vancouver Canucks, and many fans cheered after the announcement was made. Following the Boston Marathon bombing, several teams (including Boston&#x27;s archrival, the New York Yankees) temporarily played &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; in the middle of the eighth inning as well, or at other times during the game, as a means of showing solidarity with the City of Boston. The New York Mets have previously used &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; but have since dropped it. After experimenting with it during select games during the 2014 season, the Mets began to implement Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Piano Man&quot; as a full-time sing along. Similarly, starting in 2008, the Kansas City Royals began to play &quot;Friends in Low Places&quot; by celebrity supporter and one-time spring training invitee Garth Brooks during the middle of the 8th.

The Los Angeles Dodgers also hold an 8th inning tradition, with fans singing Journey&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot;. The practice came under controversy when the song&#x27;s author, Steve Perry, a Bay Area native and San Francisco Giants fan, asked the Dodgers to stop the tradition. The team refused and continue to play the song through the 2013 season. The Minnesota Twins, who played the same song, ended the tradition upon moving to Target Field in 2010.

The Journey song &quot;Lights&quot; is frequently played at San Francisco Giants baseball games (including a version led by Perry himself in the middle of the 8th inning during Game 2 of the 2010 World Series) and the cross-bay Oakland Athletics after-game fireworks starts.

The Detroit Tigers also play the beginning of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; in the eighth inning, showing the lyrics on the big screen. The Washington Nationals play &quot;Baby Shark&quot; in the middle of the 8th inning, in honor of Gerardo Parra&#x27;s walkup song and their first and only World Series title. The Oakland Athletics play Bay Area native MC Hammer&#x27;s &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; during the middle of the eighth. The Cleveland Guardians play &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot;, Ohio&#x27;s official rock song, during the middle of the 8th, and fans spell out O-H-I-O at the appropriate times within the song (similar to Ohio State University and other Cleveland sporting events). The San Diego Padres play the Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; during the middle of the 8th. The New York Yankees used to play &quot;Cotton Eyed Joe&quot; in the 8th inning. They currently do a 1980s music song with a camera panning the crowd. The St. Louis Cardinals play &quot;Here Comes the King&quot; in between the 7th and 8th innings.

=== 6th inning traditions ===
After the Tampa Bay Devil Rays&#x27; 1998 home opener, they played the popular Jimmy Buffett song &quot;Fins&quot; after the 6th inning, rather than the 7th-inning stretch. The grounds crew sent on the field after the 6th inning wore tropical clothing, and everyone in the park formed their arms into fins for the &quot;Fins to the left, fins to the right&quot; portions of the song. This tradition was dropped several years later.

Between the top and bottom of the 6th inning, the New York Yankees play &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; by Village People while the grounds crew come out and clean the infield. In the chorus, the grounds crew drop their tools and do the &quot;YMCA&quot; dance with their arms. The middle of the 6th inning at Milwaukee Brewers games is time for the Sausage Race, when people running in costumes for the bratwurst, Polish sausage, Italian sausage, hot dog and chorizo get up to 45,000 fans on their feet as they race around the clay dirt near the dugouts of American Family Field. Other teams hold similar races. The Pittsburgh Pirates hold the &quot;Great Pittsburgh Pierogi Race N&#x27;At&quot; (also called the Great Pierogi Race) during the sixth inning at home games, where people dressed as cartoon cheese, sauerkraut, jalapeno, potato, onion, and bacon pierogies run around the warning track at PNC Park. This race is often combined with visiting mascots such as the Brewers&#x27; sausages or the Nationals&#x27; presidents.

<text>Cortical maps are collections (areas) of minicolumns in the brain cortex that have been identified as performing a specific information processing function (texture maps, color maps, contour maps, etc.).

== Cortical maps ==
Cortical organization, especially for the sensory systems, is often described in terms of maps. For example, sensory information from the foot projects to one cortical site and the projections from the hand target in another site. As the result of this somatotopic organization of sensory inputs to the cortex, cortical representation of the body resembles a map (or homunculus).

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, several groups began exploring the impacts of removing portions of the . Michael Merzenich and Jon Kaas and Doug Rasmusson used the cortical map as their dependent variable. They found—and this has been since corroborated by a wide range of labs—that if the cortical map is deprived of its input it will become activated at a later time in response to other, usually adjacent inputs. At least in the somatic sensory system, in which this phenomenon has been most thoroughly investigated, JT Wall and J Xu have traced the mechanisms underlying this plasticity. Re-organization is not cortically emergent, but occurs at every level in the processing hierarchy; this produces the map changes observed in the cerebral cortex.

Merzenich and William Jenkins (1990) initiated studies relating sensory experience, without pathological perturbation, to cortically observed plasticity in the primate somatosensory system, with the finding that sensory sites activated in an attended operant behavior increase in their cortical representation. Shortly thereafter, Ford Ebner and colleagues (1994) made similar efforts in the rodent whisker barrel cortex (also somatic sensory system). These two groups largely diverged over the years. The rodent whisker barrel efforts became a focus for Ebner, Matthew Diamond, Michael Armstrong-James, Robert Sachdev, Kevin Fox and great inroads were made in identifying the locus of change as being at cortical synapses expressing NMDA receptors, and in implicating cholinergic inputs as necessary for normal expression. However, the rodent studies were poorly focused on the behavioral end, and Ron Frostig and Daniel Polley (1999, 2004) identified behavioral manipulations as causing a substantial impact on the cortical plasticity in that system.

Merzenich and DT Blake (2002, 2005, 2006) went on to use cortical implants to study the evolution of plasticity in both the somatosensory and auditory systems. Both systems show similar changes with respect to behavior. When a stimulus is cognitively associated with reinforcement, its cortical representation is strengthened and enlarged. In some cases, cortical representations can increase two to threefold in 1–2 days at the time at which a new sensory motor behavior is first acquired, and changes are largely finished within at most a few weeks. Control studies show that these changes are not caused by sensory experience alone: they require learning about the sensory experience, and are strongest for the stimuli that are associated with reward, and occur with equal ease in operant and classical conditioning behaviors.

An interesting phenomenon involving cortical maps is the incidence of phantom limbs (see Ramachandran for review). This is most commonly described in people that have undergone amputations in hands, arms, and legs, but it is not limited to extremities. The phantom limb feeling, which is thought to result from disorganization in the brain map and the inability to receive input from the targeted area, may be annoying or painful. Incidentally, it is more common after unexpected losses than planned amputations. There is a high correlation with the extent of physical remapping and the extent of phantom pain. As it fades, it is a fascinating functional example of new neural connections in the human adult brain.

Norman Doidge, following the lead of Michael Merzenich, separates manifestations of neuroplasticity into adaptations that have positive or negative behavioral consequences. For example, if an organism can recover after a stroke to normal levels of performance, that adaptiveness could be considered an example of &quot;positive plasticity&quot;. An excessive level of neuronal growth leading to spasticity or tonic paralysis, or an excessive release of neurotransmitters in response to injury which could kill nerve cells; this would have to be considered a &quot;negative&quot; plasticity. In addition, drug addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder are deemed examples of &quot;negative plasticity&quot; by Dr. Doidge, as the synaptic rewiring resulting in these behaviors is also highly maladaptive.

A 2005 study found that the effects of neuroplasticity occur even more rapidly than previously expected. Medical students&#x27; brains were imaged during the period when they were studying for their exams. In a matter of months, the students&#x27; gray matter increased significantly in the posterior and lateral parietal cortex.

<text>Northern Ontario School of Medicine University (NOSM University; , Université ÉMNO) is a public medical university in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is mandated both to educate doctors and to contribute to care in Northern Ontario&#x27;s urban, rural and remote communities, and has campuses in both Sudbury and Thunder Bay.

The Northern Ontario School of Medicine was originally created as a partnership between Laurentian University in Sudbury and Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, before being made a standalone university in April 2022.

The school is known for its small class size, its distributed model of education, heavy emphasis on enabling technologies, problem-based and self-directed learning, and early exposure to clinical skills. The school describes its campus as &quot;Northern Ontario&quot;. This is evidenced by the close relationship between the school and various communities and First Nations throughout the region. All students complete a month-long placement in an Aboriginal or Métis community in May of their first year. In second year, they travel to smaller communities for two, month-long placements (one in the fall and the other in the winter). The third year is clerkship and is spent living in one of the medium-sized communities for the entire year. The fourth year of studies is completed in Sudbury or Thunder Bay.

In 2021, following the 2021 Laurentian University financial crisis, the provincial government announced NOSM would become an independent institution which would retain collaborative relationships with both Laurentian and Lakehead but will be funded directly by the provincial government as a standalone university. 

The school also accepts donations from the public, health care agencies, local governments, foundations and corporations. Donors can choose to support a particular area of the school&#x27;s development, including social accountability, research capacity, human resource planning and innovation in education. Some of NOSM&#x27;s largest donors include AstraZeneca, Barrick Gold, BMO Bank of Montreal, Bristol Myers Squibb, CTV, Eli Lilly, Fidelity Investments, HSBC Bank Canada, Hydro One Inc., Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, City of Greater Sudbury, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, TD Bank Financial Group, City of Thunder Bay, and Wyeth Canada.

==History==

Before the creation of NOSM, Northern Ontario had for several years been designated as &quot;underserviced&quot;, meaning that the region&#x27;s ratio of medical professionals to the general population was not meeting the standards set by the Ministry of Health. As a result, a multifaceted plan was adopted by the province, including the creation of NOSM and the adoption of special recruitment strategies. A study of medical services in Ontario, released in August 2005, found that for the first time in many years, the region&#x27;s level of medical services had improved over the previous year.

Construction on both campuses began in mid-2004, and the buildings were completed in August 2005. NOSM accepted its charter class of 56 students in September of that same year and the school was officially opened by Premier Dalton McGuinty on 13 September 2005. The school received full accreditation from the Committee on Accreditation of Canadian Medical Schools (CACMS) and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) in February 2009.

The fictional Boréal Medical School, the setting of the Canadian medical drama television series &quot;Hard Rock Medical&quot;, is based on the Northern Ontario School of Medicine.

==Admissions==

The Northern Ontario School of Medicine is one of only two medical schools in Canada outside of Quebec (along with University of Ottawa) that does not require an MCAT score to be considered for admission. Furthermore, the only academic prerequisite is a university undergraduate degree with a minimum GPA of 3.0 out of 4.0 (the mean GPA of the 2013/2014 entering class was 3.83). To help further its social accountability mandate, NOSM does take into account where candidates are from and whether they have studied or worked in Northern Ontario or other rural or remote places. For each entering class since the schools inception in 2005, approximately 90-95% were from Northern Ontario. Each year, approximately 2000 applicants compete for the 64 spots in each class (36 at the Sudbury campus and 28 at the Thunder Bay campus). Applicants request their preferred campus at the time of their interview.

==Hospitals==
Fully affiliated teaching hospitals:
*Health Sciences North – Sudbury
*Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre – Thunder Bay

Larger community teaching hospitals:
*South Muskoka Memorial Hospital – Bracebridge
*LaVerendrye Hospital – Fort Frances
*Huntsville District Memorial Hospital – Huntsville
*Sensenbrenner Hospital - Kapuskasing
*Lake of the Woods District Hospital – Kenora
*Temiskaming Hospital – New Liskeard
*North Bay General Hospital – North Bay
*West Parry Sound Health Centre – Parry Sound
*Sault Area Hospital – Sault Ste. Marie
*Sioux Lookout Meno Ya Win Health Centre – Sioux Lookout
*Timmins and District Hospital – Timmins

The students also go to communities in the north such as Hearst, Smooth Rock Falls, Cochrane.

==Health Sciences Library==
The Northern Ontario School of Medicine also operates the Health Sciences Library (HSL), formerly known as the Northern Ontario Virtual Library (NOVL) to northern health-care professionals, and the Health Information Resource Centre (HIRC) to faculty, students and residents. The HSL aims to meet the traditional and expanding information needs of NOSM&#x27;s learners and faculty, as well as registered health professionals throughout the region of Northern Ontario. It sponsors in-person and technologically mediated instruction on the latest health sciences resources and information technology, among other topics. The explicit aim is to further the practice of evidence-based medicine in the North, with special focus on the physicians, residents, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and other health care professionals in northern and/or rural communities.

<text>Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire is an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Herefordshire and Worcestershire.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 79,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==
Radio Wyvern originally went on-air on 4 October 1982. The original Wyvern name derived from the River Wye and River Severn, the rivers running through Hereford and Worcester respectively (the name was proposed in the 1970s for what would become the county of Hereford and Worcester). The initial presentation team consisted of Sammy Southall at Breakfast, Roy Leonard in the morning, Graham Hughes in the afternoon and rock shows, and Mike George at drivetime. Weekend presenters included Jeff Roberts, Rob Yarnold and Bob Lee. Managing Director from 1984 until 1996 was Norman Bilton who joined Wyvern from Two Counties Radio in Bournemouth and Metro Radio in Newcastle.

The offices and studios were located in the former Hereford and Worcester County Council Education Department building at 5/6 Barbourne Terrace, north of Worcester city centre. The studio block was newly constructed at the rear of the main building, incorporating two identical on-air self-operated studios, using MBI desks, surrounding a central &#x27;talks&#x27; studio. In accordance with the then IBA Code of Engineering Practice, the entrance to each studio was through a two-door &quot;air-lock&quot;, ensuring high acoustic isolation. EMT 948 turntables, Studer B67 tape decks and Sonifex Micro-HS cartridge machines were used in these studios. From the first day, a split-transmission system for commercial breaks was provided (to play separate advertising breaks to Worcestershire and to Herefordshire), using secondary cue-tones to fire sequences of cartridges, but this was rarely, if ever, used on air. News was broadcast from one of the &#x27;guest&#x27; microphone positions in the on-air studio, operated by the presenter not the newsreader. Other voice reports for news, or telephone interviews, were carried out in a &quot;meat safe&quot; style studio inside the newsroom. The Technical Director in charge of all equipment was Rob Yarnold.

In its early days, the station opened at 6am (7am on Sundays) and closed at 8pm, before it extended broadcasting hours to 24 hours a day by joining up with Beacon Radio from 10pm and then a wider network of Midlands stations from 1am. Radio Wyvern took the SuperStation overnight service in the late 1980s, and when that closed abruptly, a local Late Show was introduced, with the overnight output from 1am shared with BRMB and Mercia FM.

The station has played host to many well-known broadcasters over the years. Jane Garvey who was the launch presenter for BBC Radio 5 Live and later one of the key presenters for Woman&#x27;s Hour held her first professional radio job here, assisting the presentation department and reading sports news on air. Neil Fox began his professional broadcasting career here in 1984, and the line &quot;Wyvern News, this is Howard Hughes&quot; became very familiar to listeners. Rich Edwards, who joined in the very early days, presented on Classic Hits until its abrupt closure in 2007. David Holdsworth, now with the BBC was the station&#x27;s News Editor, and Eleanor Oldroyd, now with BBC Radio 5 Live, was a member of the Sport team. Several of the original presenters including Mike George, Graham Hughes, and Roy Leonard went on to long careers with BBC radio and television.

The station split into Wyvern FM on 5 February 1996, playing newer music, and Wyvern AM (Quality and Variety), which was essentially a gold service, with both services initially simulcasting from 7pm to 6am. The AM station was rebranded as Classic Gold soon afterwards, and was sold to Murfin Music International because of ownership regulations and the large overlap with neighbouring Classic Gold 774 in Gloucestershire. Some time later, it was rebranded as Classic Hits, and by this time a fully-fledged local service, with no links to Wyvern FM or the Classic Gold network. In 2007, Laser Broadcasting abruptly relaunched the AM station as Sunshine Radio.

In 1997, Wyvern was acquired by GWR and later, Global Radio, who moved the station to new studios at Kirkham House in the Perdiswell Park area of Worcester. On 8 August 2008, it was confirmed that due to competition &#x27;conflict of interests&#x27; in the West Midlands (and in other areas), Wyvern FM would be sold by Global Radio, along with other West Midlands owned GCap/Global stations BRMB, Mercia FM, Heart 106, and Beacon Radio. In July 2009, the station was sold officially to a company backed by Lloyds Development Capital and Phil Riley called Orion Media. Following the take over in January 2010, Wyvern FM rebranded as Wyvern and launched a new station slogan, &quot;Made for Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire&quot;.

On 9 January 2012, Orion Media announced that Wyvern would be rebranded as Free Herefordshire and Worcestershire from April 2012. Local programming was retained at breakfast and weekday drivetime.

The Wyvern brand was phased out on 21 March 2012 in preparation for the rebrand, which took place at 7pm on Monday 26 March 2012.

On 6 May 2016, the station&#x27;s owners, Orion, announced they had been bought by Bauer for an undisclosed fee, reportedly between £40 and £50 million.

In May 2019, following OFCOM&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Bauer announced it would cease local programming and the studios in Worcester would close. Free&#x27;s Herefordshire and Worcestershire breakfast show is now shared with the sister station in Coventry &amp; Warwickshire from 8 July 2019, presented by John Dalziel and Roisin McCourt.

The localised weekday drivetime shows were initially replaced by a single regional show, presented by Andy Goulding. Regional weekend afternoon shows were axed in favour of additional network programming. As of 2 September 2019, further networked output replaced the weekday drivetime show.

On 23 November 2021, Bauer announced the station&#x27;s &quot;Hits at Breakfast&quot; show, presented by John Dalziel and Roisin McCourt, would broadcast across all four Free Radio licences. The move was permitted under OFCOM&#x27;s local content guidelines. The Herefordshire and Worcestershire station retains opt-outs for local news, traffic updates and advertising.

In August 2022 ‘Radio Today’ announced that the ‘Radio Wyvern’ name is to return to the airwaves of Worcestershire following the rebrand of Youthcomm Radio will become Radio Wyvern from October, on FM, DAB and Online.

===Hits Radio rebrand===
On 10 January 2024, station owners Bauer announced Free Radio would be rebranded as Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire from April 17th 2024, as part of a network-wide relaunch involving 17 local radio stations in England and Wales.

The station&#x27;s local news and regional output will not be affected as a result of the relaunch.

==Programming==
All networked programming originates from Bauer’s Manchester studios.

Regional programming, under the &quot;Hits at Breakfast&quot; banner, is produced and broadcast from Bauer’s Birmingham studios weekdays from 6-10am, presented by John Dalziel and Roisin McCourt.

===News===
Bauer&#x27;s Birmingham newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins for Herefordshire and Worcestershire hourly from 6am-7pm on weekdays, from 7am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked bulletins on weekend afternoons, usually originating from Bauer&#x27;s Leeds newsroom.

<text>Ten 17 was an Independent Local Radio station, broadcast from studios at the Latton Bush Centre in Harlow. The station launched in May 1993 and served Harlow, East Herts and West Essex until its closure on 25 July 2010.

==History==

Ten 17 came into existence following long campaigning work by a voluntary group, Harlow Community Radio Association (HCRA), which had the goal of launching a community radio station for the Harlow area. HCRA was led by four former Harlow Hospital Radio officers: Russ Lewell (chairman), Alan Hall (Secretary), Tony Saxby (Treasurer) and Tony Poole (Station Manager), who formed Harlow Radio Ltd as the legal entity for the group. 

HCRA and Harlow Radio Ltd had well over 100 volunteers, community groups and local businesses interested in radio, or with a community orientation, and supportive of a radio station specifically for Harlow. Indeed, the HCRA team were successful in obtaining a £36,000 grant from Harlow Council to build a suite of studios and office space at its Latton Bush Centre. 

Due to the success of the group, which gained widespread support from the local community, the Radio Authority (the regulator at the time) was sufficiently impressed by the Group&#x27;s work and offer that they decided to advertise Harlow as one of the first licences for its new small scale commercial radio licences. Indeed, when the advertisement of the operating licence was announced, Harlow Radio Ltd was the only applicant group and it was widely assumed that they would be successful in being granted the licence.

However, the Radio Authority suspended the licence grant having reservations about the level of financial backing for the community group. HCRA therefore entered discussions with Essex Radio Group to agree terms to jointly run the radio station. Essex Radio Group Chairman, Eric Moonman, and Managing Director, Phil Hinton, took a personal interest in the cooperation, and a Station Director from Essex Radio, Peter Kerridge, was appointed to lead the development and launch what then became Ten 17. Essex Radio formed a new legal entity, Harlow FM Ltd, and Russ Lewell and Alan Hall from the original HCRA group became directors of the re-formed company, along with Eric Moonman, Phil Hinton and Mick Garrett (Essex Radio Finance Director). Although Essex Radio was the major shareholder, members of the HCRA were also given the opportunity to purchase shares, which many did.

Ten 17 launched on 1 May 1993. The first presenters were taken from the group of HCRA volunteers and trained by the Essex Radio Team. Russ Lewell was the first presenter to speak on Ten 17, introducing the first song - Simply The Best, by Tina Turner - and other voluntary presenters at the time of launch included Tony Saxby, Ian Daborn, Lee Canderton, Graham Hindley and Vic James. Steve Sampson and Steve Saunders presented the popular Megasport programme on Saturday afternoons, featuring local and national sports news and music, supported by a team of dedicated volunteers. 

Alan Hall developed a Training Programme for Features Presenters, to produce short, punchy three minute features. Alan also produced four series of features himself, each following the work of local services - including “On The Beat” (following the work of Harlow Police), “Harlow Ambulance”, “Harlow Green Watch” (Fire and Rescue Service) and “London Stansted”. 

Other Features Presenters included Liz Good, Phil Dale and James Cassidy. 

There were only two paid members of the presenting team on launch - Tony Williams (Presenter of the Drivetime Show) and Matt Precey (Journalist / News Presenter). The rest of the output was provided by a combination of shows presented by trained volunteers and content fed from Essex Radio, with local news interjected. 

A few months after launch, though, Ten17 introduced its own breakfast programme, presented by former volunteers Vic James and, latterly, Gary Mulligan. 

The technical team was headed locally by Zulqar Cheema and the Station Receptionist was Judy Crosby - who went on to marry Ten 17 Director and Features Presenter, Alan Hall. 

Many volunteers who presented programmes on Ten 17 have gone on to have successful careers in broadcasting and the media, including Simon Burrell (Simon James) and James Burrell (James Hill), Scott Hughes, Chris Badcock, Gavin Inskip, David Francis, Debbie (Mac) Mackintosh (now Johnson), Dave Wartnaby, Gary Mulligan and Wyatt Wendels (Planet Rock)..

On Peter&#x27;s departure from Ten 17, Russ Lewell, one of the original founders and presenter, became Station Director. 
== Rebrand and Closure ==

=== Rebranding ===

1999 - DMG Radio Ltd 

In 1999, Ten 17 FM was rebranded as Mercury FM, as were 5 of the 6 stations owned by DMG Radio Ltd. This station was known as Mercury 101.7. It was then changed back to Ten 17 when it was bought by GWR.

===The 2000s onwards - GWR, GCap, and Global===

Ten 17&#x27;s owners, GWR, later merged with Capital Radio to become GCap. The station was retained. GCap was then bought by Global Radio in 2008. Up until July 2010, the station formed part of Global&#x27;s The Hit Music Network, broadcasting a mix of locally produced output from Harlow and networked programming from Nottingham.

===Closure===
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to rebrand Ten 17 as &quot;Heart&quot; and merge the station with Heart Essex and Heart Colchester as part of restructuring plans for the Heart Network.

The new station, &quot;Heart Essex&quot;, launched on Monday 26 July 2010 and broadcasts from studios in Chelmsford. The very last programme from Ten 17 was broadcast on Sunday 25 July 2010.

<doc id="941592" wikidata="Q2751085" url="?curid=941592" title="Upper middle class">
<text>In sociology, the upper middle class is the social group constituted by higher status members of the middle class. This is in contrast to the term &quot;lower middle class&quot;, which is used for the group at the opposite end of the middle-class stratum, and to the broader term &quot;middle class&quot;. There is considerable debate as to how the upper middle class might be defined. According to sociologist Max Weber, the upper middle class consists of well-educated professionals with postgraduate degrees and comfortable incomes.

The American upper middle class is defined similarly using income, education, and occupation as the predominant indicators. In the United States, the upper middle class is defined as consisting mostly of white-collar professionals who not only have above-average personal incomes and advanced educational degrees but also a higher degree of autonomy in their work. The main occupational tasks of upper-middle-class individuals tend to center on conceptualizing, consulting, and instruction.

==American upper middle class==

The American middle class (and its subdivisions) is not a strictly defined concept across disciplines, as economists and sociologists do not agree on defining the term. In academic models, the term &quot;upper middle class&quot; applies to highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed. Many have postgraduate degrees, with educational attainment serving as the main distinguishing feature of this class. Household incomes commonly exceed $100,000 ($163,000 in 2024 dollars). Typical professions for this class include lawyers, physicians, military officers, psychologists, certified public accountants, pharmacists, optometrists, financial planners, dentists, engineers, scientists, professors, architects, urban planners, civil service executives, and civilian contractors.

In addition to having autonomy in their work, above-average incomes, and advanced educations, the upper middle class also tends to be influential, setting trends and largely shaping public opinion. Overall, members of this class are also secure from economic down-turns and, unlike their counterparts in the statistical middle class, do not need to fear downsizing, corporate cost-cutting, or outsourcing—an economic benefit largely attributable to their postgraduate degrees and comfortable incomes, likely in the top income quintile or top third.

===Income===

While many Americans cite income as the prime determinant of class, occupational status, educational attainment, and value systems are equally important variables. Income is in part determined by the scarcity of certain skill sets. An occupation that requires a scarce skill set which is attained through higher educational degree, and which involves higher autonomy, responsibility and influence, will usually offer higher economic compensation. Qualifying for such higher income often requires that individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g., by attending law, medical, or postgraduate school) and demonstrate the necessary competencies. There are also differences between household and individual income. In 2005, 42% of US households (76% among the top quintile) had two or more income earners; as a result, 18% of households but only 5% of individuals had six-figure incomes. To illustrate, two nurses each making $55,000 per year can out-earn, in a household sense, a single attorney who makes a median of $95,000 annually.

Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15% of the population. Using the 15% figure one may conclude that the American upper middle class consists, strictly in an income sense, of professionals with personal incomes in excess of $62,500 ($101,000 in 2024 dollars), who commonly reside in households with six-figure incomes. The difference between personal and household income can be explained by considering that 76% of households with incomes exceeding $90,000 (the top 20%, $170,000 to cross this threshold in 2020 dollars) had two or more income earners. In 2024, the threshold for entering the top 15% of American household incomes is $202,000 


The above income thresholds may vary greatly based on region due to significant differences in average income based on region and urban, suburban, or rural development. In more expensive suburbs, the threshold for the top 15% of income earners may be much higher. For example, in 2006 the ten highest income counties had median household incomes of $85,000 compared to a national average of about $50,000. The top 15% of all US income earners nationally tend to be more concentrated in these richer suburban counties where the cost of living is also higher. If middle-class households earning between the 50th percentile ($46,000) and the 85th percentile ($62,500) tend to live in lower cost of living areas, then their difference in &quot;real income&quot; may be smaller than what the differences in nominal income suggest.

===Values===
Political ideology is not found to be correlated with social class; however, a statistical relationship is seen between the level of one&#x27;s educational attainment and one&#x27;s likelihood of subscribing to a particular political ideology. In terms of income, liberals tend to be tied with pro-business conservatives. Most mass affluent households tend to be more right-leaning on fiscal issues but more left-leaning on social issues. The majority, between 50% and 60%, of households with incomes above $50,000 overall, not all of whom are upper middle class, supported the Republican Party in the 2000, 2004, and 2006 elections. Those with postgraduate degrees who work in academia statistically favor the Democratic Party. For example, in 2005, 72% of surveyed full-time faculty members at four-year institutions, the majority of whom would be considered upper middle class, identified themselves as liberal.

The upper middle class is often the dominant group to shape society and bring social movements to the forefront. Movements such as the peace movement, the anti-nuclear movement, environmentalism, the anti-smoking movement, and even in the past with blue laws and the temperance movement have been in large part (although not solely), products of the upper middle class. Some claim this is because this is the largest class (and the lowest class) with any true political power for change, while others claim some of the more restrictive social movements (such as with smoking and drinking) are based upon &quot;saving people from themselves.&quot;

==British upper middle class==

The upper middle class in Britain traditionally consists of the educated professionals who were born into higher-income backgrounds, such as legal professionals, executives, and surgeons. This stratum, in England, traditionally uses Received Pronunciation natively. A typical Mosaic geodemographic type for this group would be cultural leadership. It is also usually assumed that this class is most predominant in the home counties of South East England and the more affluent boroughs of London. Children of this group are often educated at a preparatory school until about 13 years old and then at one of the &quot;major&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; British public schools which will typically charge fees of at least £11,500 per year per pupil (as of 2013) followed by studying at post-graduation level.

<doc id="941607" wikidata="Q16983682" url="?curid=941607" title="Heart Ipswich">
<text>Heart Ipswich (formerly SGR FM) was an Independent Local Radio station that evolved from Suffolk Group Radio, which was the parent company for two Independent radio stations serving the county of Suffolk in England.

==Overview==
The older of the radio stations was Radio Orwell, which began transmissions in Ipswich on 28 October 1975 on 257m MW. It was one of the original group of ILR stations set up by the Independent Broadcasting Authority following relaxation of the rules governing broadcasting in Britain. Other stations that were included in the original 19 were LBC and Capital Radio in London and BRMB in Birmingham.

The western side of Suffolk got its own radio station in the form of Saxon Radio on 240m MW, which began broadcasting in Bury St Edmunds in November 1982. The two stations operated separate breakfast shows, and then programmes were networked from either site to both transmitters. Most of the programmes came from the studios at Electric House, Ipswich, and a few from the Bury St Edmunds&#x27; Long Brackland studios.

In 1984-85, the stations experimented with a drive-time news and current affairs programme (&quot;The Home Run&quot;) which had presenters in both studios - Allan Lee in Ipswich and Adrienne Rosen in Bury. This proved too expensive to continue for long and the programme was cut back to one presenter in the Ipswich studio.

Ipswich Town FC was sponsored by Radio Orwell and had the station&#x27;s logo on the front of the team&#x27;s shirts in the mid-1980s.

In 1990, the stations were taken over by the successful Norwich-based Radio Broadland to form the East Anglian Radio group, run by the Broadland management team. EAR re-launched Orwell and Saxon as one station under the SGR-FM banner in 1992 and also won the licence to start SGR Colchester in Essex the following year. The group launched a new service in 1995 called Amber Radio, with studios in Ipswich and Norwich, on the AM transmitters previously used to simulcast the SGR stations; these, some years later, became Classic Gold Amber and then Gold. In 1996, EAR was bought by the GWR Group network, which continued to run the stations for about 10 years until it was taken over by Global Radio.

===Heart rebrand===
On 5 January 2009, SGR-FM was renamed as &quot;Heart&quot;, as part of a major re-brand involving 29 One Network stations. By that time, local programming was restricted to daily breakfast and weekday afternoon drivetime shows with all other output networked from London. As part of the re-brand, the station pulled out of a contract to broadcast live commentary on Ipswich Town FC games after just one season.

===Network restructuring===
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart Ipswich and merge the station with Heart Norwich as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new station, &quot;Heart East Anglia&quot;, began broadcasting from Norwich on 3 September 2010.

<text>The unity of consciousness and (cognitive) binding problem is the problem of how objects, background, and abstract or emotional features are combined into a single experience. The binding problem refers to the overall encoding of our brain circuits for the combination of decisions, actions, and perception. It is considered a &quot;problem&quot; because no complete model exists.

The binding problem can be subdivided into the four areas of perception, neuroscience, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. It includes general considerations on coordination, the subjective unity of perception, and variable binding.

== General considerations on coordination ==
===Summary of problem ===
Attention is crucial in determining which phenomena appear to be bound together, noticed, and remembered. This specific binding problem is generally referred to as temporal synchrony. At the most basic level, all neural firing and its adaptation depends on specific consideration to timing (Feldman, 2010). At a much larger level, frequent patterns in large scale neural activity are a major diagnostic and scientific tool.

=== Synchronization theory and research ===
A popular hypothesis mentioned by neuroscientist Prof Peter Milner, in his 1974 article &quot;A Model for Visual Shape Recognition&quot;, has been that features of individual objects are bound/segregated via synchronization of the activity of different neurons in the cortex. The theory, called binding-by-synchrony (BBS), is hypothesized to occur through the transient mutual synchronization of neurons located in different regions of the brain when the stimulus is presented. Empirical testing of the idea was brought to light when von der Malsburg proposed that feature binding posed a special problem that could not be covered simply by cellular firing rates. However, it has been shown this theory may not be a problem since it was revealed that the modules code jointly for multiple features, countering the feature-binding issue. Temporal synchrony has been shown to be the most prevalent when regarding the first problem, &quot;General Considerations on Coordination,&quot; because it is an effective method to take in surroundings and is good for grouping and segmentation. A number of studies suggested that there is indeed a relationship between rhythmic synchronous firing and feature binding. This rhythmic firing appears to be linked to intrinsic oscillations in neuronal somatic potentials, typically in the gamma range around 40 – 60 hertz. The positive arguments for a role for rhythmic synchrony in resolving the segregational object-feature binding problem have been summarized by Neurophysiologist Prof Singer. There is certainly extensive evidence for synchronization of neural firing as part of responses to visual stimuli.

However, there is inconsistency between findings from different laboratories. Moreover, a number of recent reviewers, including neuroscientists Prof Shadlen and Prof Movshon and Prof Merker have raised concerns about the theory being potentially untenable. Neuroscientists Prof Thiele and Prof Stoner found that perceptual binding of two moving patterns had no effect on synchronization of the neurons responding to two patterns: coherent and noncoherent plaids. In the primary visual cortex, Dong et al. found that whether two neurons were responding to contours of the same shape or different shapes had no effect on neural synchrony since synchrony is independent of binding condition.

Shadlen and Movshon raise a series of doubts about both the theoretical and the empirical basis for the idea of segregational binding by temporal synchrony. There is no biophysical evidence that cortical neurons are selective to synchronous input at this point of precision, and cortical activity with synchrony this precise is rare. Synchronization is also connected to endorphin activity. It has been shown that precise spike timing may not be necessary to illustrate a mechanism for visual binding and is only prevalent in modeling certain neuronal interactions. In contrast, Anil Seth describes an artificial brain-based robot that demonstrates multiple, separate, widely distributed neural circuits, firing at different phases, showing that regular brain oscillations at specific frequencies are essential to the neural mechanisms of binding.

Cognitive psychologists Prof Goldfarb and Prof Treisman point out that a logical problem appears to arise for binding solely via synchrony if there are several objects that share some of their features and not others. At best synchrony can facilitate segregation supported by other means (as physicist and neuroscientist Prof von der Malsburg acknowledges).

A number of neuropsychological studies suggest that the association of color, shape and movement as &quot;features of an object&quot; is not simply a matter of linking or &quot;binding&quot;, but shown to be inefficient to not bind elements into groups when considering association, and give extensive evidence for top-down feedback signals that ensure that sensory data are handled as features of (sometimes wrongly) postulated objects early in processing. Pylyshyn has also emphasized the way the brain seems to pre-conceive objects from which features are to be allocated to which are attributed continuing existence even if features such as color change. This is because visual integration increases over time, and indexing visual objects helps to ground visual concepts.

== Feature integration theory ==
=== Summary of problem ===
The visual feature binding problem refers to the question of why we do not confuse a red circle and a blue square with a blue circle and a red square. The understanding of the circuits in the brain stimulated for visual feature binding is increasing. A binding process is required for us to accurately encode various visual features in separate cortical areas.

In her feature integration theory, Treisman suggested that one of the first stages of binding between features is mediated by the features&#x27; links to a common location. The second stage is combining individual features of an object that requires attention, and selecting that object occurs within a &quot;master map&quot; of locations. Psychophysical demonstrations of binding failures under conditions of full attention provide support for the idea that binding is accomplished through common location tags.

An implication of these approaches is that sensory data such as color or motion may not normally exist in &quot;unallocated&quot; form. For Merker: &quot;The &#x27;red&#x27; of a red ball does not float disembodied in an abstract color space in V4.&quot; If color information allocated to a point in the visual field is converted directly, via the instantiation of some form of propositional logic (analogous to that used in computer design) into color information allocated to an &quot;object identity&quot; postulated by a top-down signal as suggested by Purves and Lotto (e.g. There is blue here + Object 1 is here = Object 1 is blue) no special computational task of &quot;binding together&quot; by means such as synchrony may exist. (Although Von der Malsburg poses the problem in terms of binding &quot;propositions&quot; such as &quot;triangle&quot; and &quot;top&quot;, these, in isolation, are not propositional.)

How signals in the brain come to have propositional content, or meaning, is a much larger issue. However, both Marr and Barlow suggested, on the basis of what was known about neural connectivity in the 1970s that the final integration of features into a percept would be expected to resemble the way words operate in sentences.

The role of synchrony in segregational binding remains controversial. Merker has recently suggested that synchrony may be a feature of areas of activation in the brain that relates to an &quot;infrastructural&quot; feature of the computational system analogous to increased oxygen demand indicated via BOLD signal contrast imaging. Apparent specific correlations with segregational tasks may be explainable on the basis of interconnectivity of the areas involved. As a possible manifestation of a need to balance excitation and inhibition over time it might be expected to be associated with reciprocal re-entrant circuits as in the model of Anil Seth. (Merker gives the analogy of the whistle from an audio amplifier receiving its own output.)

=== Experimental work ===
Visual feature binding is suggested to have a selective attention to the locations of the objects. If indeed spatial attention does play a role in binding integration it will do so primarily when object location acts as a binding cue. A study&#x27;s findings have shown that functional MRI images indicate regions of the parietal cortex involved in spatial attention, engaged in feature conjunction tasks in single feature tasks. The task involved multiple objects being shown simultaneously at different locations which activated the parietal cortex, whereas when multiple objects are shown sequentially at the same location the parietal cortex was less engaged.

==== Behavioral experiments ====
Dezfouli et al. investigated feature binding through two feature dimensions to disambiguate whether a specific combination of color and motion direction is perceived as bound or unbound. Two behaviorally relevant features, including color and motion belonging to the same object, are defined as the &quot;bound&quot; condition, whereas the &quot;unbound&quot; condition has features that belong to different objects. Local field potentials were recorded from the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) in monkeys and were monitored during different stimulus configurations. The findings suggest a neural representation of visual feature binding in 4 to 12 Hertz frequency bands. It is also suggested that transmission of binding information is relayed through different lPFC neural subpopulations. The data shows behavioral relevance of binding information that is linked to the animal&#x27;s reaction time. This includes the involvement of the prefrontal cortex targeted by the dorsal and ventral visual streams in binding visual features from different dimensions (color and motion).

It is suggested that the visual feature binding consists of two different mechanisms in visual perception. One mechanism consists of agonistic familiarity of possible combinations of features integrating several temporal integration windows. It is speculated that this process is mediated by neural synchronization processes and temporal synchronization in the visual cortex. The second mechanism is mediated by familiarity with the stimulus and is provided by attentional top-down support from familiar objects.

== Consciousness and binding ==
=== Summary of problem ===
Smythies defines the combination problem, also known as the subjective unity of perception, as &quot;How do the brain mechanisms actually construct the phenomenal object?&quot;. Revonsuo equates this to &quot;consciousness-related binding&quot;, emphasizing the entailment of a phenomenal aspect. As Revonsuo explores in 2006, there are nuances of difference beyond the basic BP1:BP2 division. Smythies speaks of constructing a phenomenal object (&quot;local unity&quot; for Revonsuo) but philosophers such as René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, and James (see Brook and Raymont) have typically been concerned with the broader unity of a phenomenal experience (&quot;global unity&quot; for Revonsuo) – which, as Bayne illustrates may involve features as diverse as seeing a book, hearing a tune and feeling an emotion. Further discussion will focus on this more general problem of how sensory data that may have been segregated into, for instance, &quot;blue square&quot; and &quot;yellow circle&quot; are to be re-combined into a single phenomenal experience of a blue square next to a yellow circle, plus all other features of their context. There is a wide range of views on just how real this &quot;unity&quot; is, but the existence of medical conditions in which it appears to be subjectively impaired, or at least restricted, suggests that it is not entirely illusory.

There are many neurobiological theories about the subjective unity of perception. Different visual features such as color, size, shape, and motion are computed by largely distinct neural circuits but we experience this as an integrated whole. The different visual features interact with each other in various ways. For example, shape discrimination of objects is strongly affected by orientation but only slightly affected by object size. Some theories suggest that global perception of the integrated whole involves higher order visual areas. There is also evidence that the posterior parietal cortex is responsible for perceptual scene segmentation and organization. Bodies facing each other are processed as a single unit and there is increased coupling of the extrastriate body area (EBA) and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) when bodies are facing each other. This suggests that the brain is biased towards grouping humans in twos or dyads.

The boundary problem is another unsolved problem in neuroscience and phenomenology that is related to the binding problem. The boundary problem is essentially the inverse of the binding problem, and asks how binding stops occurring and what prevents other neurological phenomena from being included in first-person perspectives, giving first-person perspectives hard boundaries. Topological segmentation and electromagnetic field topology have been proposed as possible avenues for solving the boundary problem as well as the binding problem.

=== History ===
Early philosophers René Descartes and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz noted that the apparent unity of our experience is an all-or-none qualitative characteristic that does not appear to have an equivalent in the known quantitative features, like proximity or cohesion, of composite matter. William James, in the nineteenth century, considered the ways the unity of consciousness might be explained by known physics and found no satisfactory answer. He coined the term &quot;combination problem&quot;, in the specific context of a &quot;mind-dust theory&quot; in which it is proposed that a full human conscious experience is built up from proto- or micro-experiences in the way that matter is built up from atoms. James claimed that such a theory was incoherent, since no causal physical account could be given of how distributed proto-experiences would &quot;combine&quot;. He favoured instead a concept of &quot;co-consciousness&quot; in which there is one &quot;experience of A, B and C&quot; rather than combined experiences. A detailed discussion of subsequent philosophical positions is given by Brook and Raymont (see 26). However, these do not generally include physical interpretations.

Whitehead proposed a fundamental ontological basis for a relation consistent with James&#x27;s idea of co-consciousness, in which many causal elements are co-available or &quot;compresent&quot; in a single event or &quot;occasion&quot; that constitutes a unified experience. Whitehead did not give physical specifics, but the idea of compresence is framed in terms of causal convergence in a local interaction consistent with physics. Where Whitehead goes beyond anything formally recognized in physics is in the &quot;chunking&quot; of causal relations into complex but discrete &quot;occasions&quot;. Even if such occasions can be defined, Whitehead&#x27;s approach still leaves James&#x27;s difficulty with finding a site, or sites, of causal convergence that would make neurobiological sense for &quot;co-consciousness&quot;. Sites of signal convergence do clearly exist throughout the brain but there is a concern to avoid re-inventing what Daniel Dennett calls a Cartesian Theater or a single central site of convergence of the form that Descartes proposed.

Descartes&#x27;s central &quot;soul&quot; is now rejected because neural activity closely correlated with conscious perception is widely distributed throughout the cortex. The remaining choices appear to be either separate involvement of multiple distributed causally convergent events or a model that does not tie a phenomenal experience to any specific local physical event but rather to some overall &quot;functional&quot; capacity. Whichever interpretation is taken, as Revonsuo indicates, there is no consensus on what structural level we are dealing with – whether the cellular level, that of cellular groups as &quot;nodes&quot;, &quot;complexes&quot; or &quot;assemblies&quot; or that of widely distributed networks. There is probably only general agreement that it is not the level of the whole brain, since there is evidence that signals in certain primary sensory areas, such as the V1 region of the visual cortex (in addition to motor areas and cerebellum), do not contribute directly to phenomenal experience.

=== Experimental work on the biological basis of binding ===
==== fMRI work ====
Stoll and colleagues conducted an fMRI experiment to see whether participants would view a dynamic bistable stimulus globally or locally. Responses in lower visual cortical regions were suppressed when participants viewed the stimulus globally. However, if global perception was without shape grouping, higher cortical regions were suppressed. This experiment shows that higher order cortex is important in perceptual grouping.

Grassi and colleagues used three different motion stimuli to investigate scene segmentation or how meaningful entities are grouped together and separated from other entities in a scene. Across all stimuli, scene segmentation was associated with increased activity in the posterior parietal cortex and decreased activity in lower visual areas. This suggests that the posterior parietal cortex is important for viewing an integrated whole.

==== EEG work ====
Mersad and colleagues used an EEG frequency tagging technique to differentiate between brain activity for the integrated whole object and brain activity for parts of the object. The results showed that the visual system binds two humans in close proximity as part of an integrated whole. These results are consistent with evolutionary theories that face-to-face bodies are one of the earliest representations of social interaction. It also supports other experimental work showing that body-selective visual areas respond more strongly to facing bodies.

==== Electron tunneling ====
Experiments have shown that ferritin and neuromelanin in fixed human &quot;substantia nigra pars compacta&quot; (SNc) tissue are able to support widespread electron tunneling. Further experiments have shown that ferritin structures similar to ones found in SNc tissue are able to conduct electrons over distances as great as 80 microns, and that they behave in accordance with Coulomb blockade theory to perform a switching or routing function. Both of these observations are consistent with earlier predictions that are part of a hypothesis that ferritin and neuromelanin can provide a binding mechanism associated with an action selection mechanism, although the hypothesis itself has not yet been directly investigated. The hypothesis and these observations have been applied to Integrated Information Theory.

=== Modern theories ===
Daniel Dennett has proposed that we, as humans, sensing our experiences as individual single events is illusory and that, instead, at any one time there are &quot;multiple drafts&quot; of sensory patterns at multiple sites. Each would only cover a fragment of what we think we experience. Arguably, Dennett is claiming that consciousness is not unified and there is no phenomenal binding problem. Most philosophers have difficulty with this position (see Bayne), but some physiologists agree with it. In particular, the demonstration of perceptual asynchrony in psychophysical experiments by Moutoussis and Zeki, where color is perceived before orientation of lines and before motion by 40 and 80 ms respectively, constitutes an argument that, over these very short time periods, different attributes are consciously perceived at different times, leading to the view that at least over these brief periods of time after visual stimulation, different events are not bound to each other, leading to the view of a disunity of consciousness, at least over these brief time intervals. Dennett&#x27;s view might be in keeping with evidence from recall experiments and change blindness purporting to show that our experiences are much less rich than we sense them to be – what has been called the Grand Illusion. However, few, if any, other authors suggest the existence of multiple partial &quot;drafts&quot;. Moreover, also on the basis of recall experiments, Lamme has challenged the idea that richness is illusory, emphasizing that phenomenal content cannot be equated with content to which there is cognitive access.

Dennett does not tie drafts to biophysical events. Multiple sites of causal convergence are invoked in specific biophysical terms by Edwards and Sevush. In this view the sensory signals to be combined in phenomenal experience are available, in full, at each of multiple sites. To avoid non-causal combination, each site/event is placed within an individual neuronal dendritic tree. The advantage is that &quot;compresence&quot; is invoked just where convergence occurs neuro-anatomically. The disadvantage, as for Dennett, is the counter-intuitive concept of multiple &quot;copies&quot; of experience. The precise nature of an experiential event or &quot;occasion&quot;, even if local, also remains uncertain.

The majority of theoretical frameworks for the unified richness of phenomenal experience adhere to the intuitive idea that experience exists as a single copy, and draw on &quot;functional&quot; descriptions of distributed networks of cells. Baars has suggested that certain signals, encoding what we experience, enter a &quot;Global Workspace&quot; within which they are &quot;broadcast&quot; to many sites in the cortex for parallel processing. Dehaene, Changeux and colleagues have developed a detailed neuro-anatomical version of such a workspace. Tononi and colleagues have suggested that the level of richness of an experience is determined by the narrowest information interface &quot;bottleneck&quot; in the largest sub-network or &quot;complex&quot; that acts as an integrated functional unit. Lamme has suggested that networks supporting reciprocal signaling rather than those merely involved in feed-forward signaling support experience. Edelman and colleagues have also emphasized the importance of re-entrant signaling. Cleeremans emphasizes meta-representation as the functional signature of signals contributing to consciousness.

In general, such network-based theories are not explicitly theories of how consciousness is unified, or &quot;bound&quot;, but rather theories of functional domains within which signals contribute to unified conscious experience. A concern about functional domains is what Rosenberg has called the boundary problem; it is hard to find a unique account of what is to be included and what excluded. Nevertheless, this is, if anything is, the consensus approach.

Within the network context, a role for synchrony has been invoked as a solution to the phenomenal binding problem as well as the computational one. In his book, The Astonishing Hypothesis, Crick appears to be offering a solution to BP2 as much as BP1. Even von der Malsburg, introduces detailed computational arguments about object feature binding with remarks about a &quot;psychological moment&quot;. The Singer group also appear to be interested as much in the role of synchrony in phenomenal awareness as in computational segregation.

The apparent incompatibility of using synchrony to both segregate and unify might be explained by sequential roles. However, Merker points out what appears to be a contradiction in attempts to solve the subjective unity of perception in terms of a functional (effectively meaning computational) rather than a local biophysical domain in the context of synchrony.

Functional arguments for a role for synchrony are in fact underpinned by analysis of local biophysical events. However, Merker points out that the explanatory work is done by the downstream integration of synchronized signals in post-synaptic neurons: &quot;It is, however, by no means clear what is to be understood by &#x27;binding by synchrony&#x27; other than the threshold advantage conferred by synchrony at, and only at, sites of axonal convergence onto single dendritic trees...&quot; In other words, although synchrony is proposed as a way of explaining binding on a distributed rather than a convergent basis, the justification rests on what happens at convergence. Signals for two features are proposed as bound by synchrony because synchrony effects downstream convergent interaction. Any theory of phenomenal binding based on this sort of computational function would seem to follow the same principle. The phenomenality would entail convergence, if the computational function does.

The assumption in many of the quoted models suggest that computational and phenomenal events, at least at some point in the sequence of events, parallel each other in some way. The difficulty remains in identifying what that way might be. Merker&#x27;s analysis suggests that either (1) both computational and phenomenal aspects of binding are determined by convergence of signals on neuronal dendritic trees, or (2) that our intuitive ideas about the need for &quot;binding&quot; in a &quot;holding together&quot; sense in both computational and phenomenal contexts are misconceived. We may be looking for something extra that is not needed. Merker, for instance, argues that the homotopic connectivity of sensory pathways does the necessary work.

== Cognitive science and binding ==
In modern connectionism, cognitive neuroarchitectures are developed (e.g. &quot;Oscillatory Networks&quot;, &quot;Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic (ICS) Cognitive Architecture&quot;, &quot;Holographic Reduced Representations (HRRs)&quot;, &quot;Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)&quot;) that solve the binding problem by means of integrative synchronization mechanisms (e.g. the (phase-)synchronized &quot;Binding-by-synchrony (BBS)&quot; mechanism)

:(1) in perceptual cognition (&quot;low-level cognition&quot;): This is the neurocognitive performance of how an object or event that is perceived (e.g., a visual object) is dynamically &quot;bound together&quot; from its properties (e.g., shape, contour, texture, color, direction of motion) as a mental representation, i.e., can be experienced in the mind as a unified &quot;Gestalt&quot; in terms of Gestalt psychology (&quot;feature binding&quot;, &quot;feature linking&quot;),

:(2) and in language cognition (&quot;high-level cognition&quot;): This is the neurocognitive performance of how a linguistic unit (e.g. a sentence) is generated by relating semantic concepts and syntactic roles to each other in a dynamic way so that one can generate systematic and compositional symbol structures and propositions that are experienced as complex mental representations in the mind (&quot;variable binding&quot;).

==Shared intentionality and binding==
According to bioengineering Prof Igor Val Danilov, the mother–fetus neurocognitive model—knowledge about neurophysiological processes during shared intentionality—can reveal insights into the binding problem and even the perception of object development since intentionality succeeds before organisms confront the binding problem. Indeed, at the beginning of life, the environment is the cacophony of stimuli: electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations. Because the environment is uncategorised for the organisms at this beginning stage of development, the sensation is too limited by the noise to solve the cue problem—the relevant stimulus cannot overcome the noise magnitude if it passes through the senses. While very young organisms need to combine objects, background and abstract or emotional features into a single experience for building the representation of the surrounded reality, they cannot distinguish relevant sensory stimuli independently to integrate them into object representations. Even the embodied dynamical system approach cannot get around the cue to noise problem. The application of embodied information requires an already categorised environment onto objects—holistic representation of reality—which occurs through (and only after the emergence of) perception and intentionality. In short, properties of the mother&#x27;s heart—the electromagnetic and acoustic oscillations—converge the neuronal activity of both nervous systems in an ensemble, shaping synchrony. During the mother&#x27;s intentional acts with her environment, these interchanges provide clues to the fetus&#x27;s nervous system, binding synaptic activity with relevant stimuli, occurring due to brain wave interaction between the mother&#x27;s and fetal nervous systems.

<doc id="941618" wikidata="Q16983688" url="?curid=941618" title="Heart Plymouth">
<text>Heart Plymouth (formerly Plymouth Sound) was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Plymouth in Devon, England.

==History==
The heritage name Plymouth Sound was a pun on the popular meaning of &quot;sound&quot; (in the audio sense) and the bay of Plymouth Sound between Penlee Point and Wembury Point in Devon.

In November 2005, it was announced that GCap&#x27;s local radio stations in the South West, including Plymouth Sound, were to be sold as they were outside of the company&#x27;s primary target area. Four months later GCap decided that the sale would not go ahead, essentially because the offers made fell short of their expectations.

In September 2008, it was announced that Plymouth Sound would be rebranded Heart FM as part of a national rebranding exercise by owners Global Radio, which saw twenty-nine stations renamed as Heart. &quot;Plymouth Sound&quot; was rebranded as &quot;Heart Plymouth&quot; on Monday 23 March 2009. By this time, most of the station&#x27;s programming was produced in London, with local programming broadcast at breakfast every day and at drivetime each weekday.

===Network restructuring===
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart Plymouth and merge the station with Heart Exeter and Heart Torbay, Heart North Devon and Heart South Devon as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new station, &quot;Heart Devon&quot;, began broadcasting from Exeter on 27 August 2010.

==Cross Rhythms==

The Christian media group and radio station Cross Rhythms grew out of a half-hour Christian music show on Plymouth Sound FM, which aired on Sunday evenings between 1983 and 1996. Initially called &quot;The Solid Rock of Jesus Christ&quot;, the show was renamed the &quot;Cross Rhythms Experience&quot; in 1992, and became a syndicated show in 1993. It was hosted by Chris Cole, the founder of Cross Rhythms.

<doc id="941630" wikidata="Q5692060" url="?curid=941630" title="Heart Peterborough">
<text>Heart Peterborough (formerly Hereward FM) was an Independent Local Radio station serving Cambridgeshire, south Lincolnshire and west Norfolk. Launched on 10 July 1980 as Hereward Radio 225, the station was the first local service in the area, with the studios originally based in the back of a former pub in Bridge Street, Peterborough, before relocating to the Queensgate shopping centre in the city in 1987.

==History==
With the tagline of &quot;the station you can really call your own&quot;, Hereward Radio began on 95.7 MHz and 225 metres/1332 kHz. Reorganisation of the FM broadcast band moved the station to 102.7 since around 1987/1988, with BBC Radio Cambridgeshire using the former frequency for the Peterborough area.

Notable personalities from the past include the former chief executive of GCap Media, Ralph Bernard, who was the station&#x27;s first news editor. Hereward split its AM and FM frequencies in April 1992, and called its 1332 kHz AM service &#x27;WGMS - The World&#x27;s Greatest Music Station&#x27;.

The station was bought out by the GWR Group in 1995 from its original management, Mid-Anglia Radio plc.

On 5 January 2009, Hereward FM rebranded as &quot;Heart Peterborough&quot;, as part of a major rebrand involving twenty-nine stations owned by Global Radio.

On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced that Heart Peterborough&#x27;s programming would be merged with Heart Cambridge as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. It has still got different advertisements to Heart Cambridge. &quot;Heart Cambridgeshire&#x27;s&quot; programming began broadcasting from Peterborough on 2 July 2010. On 19 September 2011, the station announced it would relocate to new studios in the Histon area of Cambridge.

===Morborne Mast collapse===
In October 2004, the 153-metre Morborne mast near Peterborough collapsed after a fire in suspicious circumstances, taking Hereward&#x27;s DAB service off the air, along with the national and local BBC services. A temporary mast was soon erected, restoring the service and a new permanent mast has since been erected.

<doc id="941637" wikidata="Q5692041" url="?curid=941637" title="Heart North Devon">
<text>Heart North Devon (formerly Lantern FM and previously Lantern Radio) was an Independent Local Radio station in North Devon.

==Technical==
The station broadcast from two locations: its main transmitter at Huntshaw Cross on 96.2FM, and a relay station to cover the Ilfracombe area on 97.3FM. Both frequencies broadcast the same output.

==History==
The station was originally known as Lantern Radio, taking its name from the local coastline, known as &quot;the Lantern Coast&quot; - smugglers would lure ships onto the rocks of the North Devon coast with lanterns, causing the ships to run aground and thus be able to be plundered.

Originally owned by a consortium of local businesspeople, Orchard Media (the owners of Somerset&#x27;s Orchard FM) purchased the station during the mid-1990s.

GWR Group purchased the group in 1999 and later merged with the Capital Radio Group to form GCap Media. In November 2005, it was announced that GCap&#x27;s local radio stations in the South West, including Lantern FM, were to be sold, as they lay outside the company&#x27;s primary target area. However, no acceptable offer was made for the stations, and the sale was abandoned. GCap was itself later taken over by Global Radio.

Initially broadcasting from studios in Bideford, the station moved in 2000 to studios in Roundswell Business Park in Barnstaple, where the station&#x27;s breakfast and drivetime shows were produced until its closure. Lantern FM was rebranded on 23 March 2009 as part of Global Radio&#x27;s Heart Network. By this time, the majority of the station&#x27;s programming was networked from the Heart Network&#x27;s main studios in Leicester Square, London.

===Network restructuring===
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart North Devon and merge the station with Heart Plymouth, Heart Exeter and Heart Torbay and Heart South Devon as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new regional station, &quot;Heart Devon&quot;, began broadcasting from Exeter on 27 August 2010.

<doc id="941652" wikidata="Q5095902" url="?curid=941652" title="Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac">
<text>The Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac is a annual yacht race starting in Lake Michigan off Chicago, Illinois, and ending in Lake Huron off Mackinac Island, Michigan. It is hosted and managed by the Chicago Yacht Club. The &quot;Mac&quot; (as it is known) was first run in 1898 and is the oldest annual freshwater distance race in the world. The race hosts several hundred competitors each year and over 3,000 sailors.

==Course==
The race starts at the Chicago Harbor Lighthouse just off Navy Pier, crosses Lake Michigan, enters Lake Huron at the Straits of Mackinac, and finishes in the Round Island Channel, off Mackinac Island, Michigan. The race course runs . In 2011, 361 boats entered the race. Steve Fossett set the overall race record, 18 hours, 50 minutes, in 1998 with the multihull yacht, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. Team Maverick, in 2024, set the monohull record, 22 hours, 24 minutes, and 23 seconds. Beating the previous record set 22 years ago by more than an hour.

==History==
Starting in 1898 with a mere five boats, The Mac has evolved into a world-class sporting event. After the first race in 1898, the Race to Mackinac was not held for five years until the second race in 1904. By 1906, the race had developed a healthy following and, in that year, the original Mackinac trophy was purchased. The race has seen occasional sustained violent weather in the blows of 1911, 1937 and 1970. After gale-force winds took down most of the fleet in the Mac of 1911, the finish in the 1912 and 1913 races was changed to Harbor Springs on Little Traverse Bay instead of Mackinac Island. Race organizers felt the shorter distance was safer. From 1914 until 1916 the Mac was back to its full distance until WWI. From 1917 to 1920 there were no Mac races due to the strains of the War, which took away yachtsmen and put many boats out of commission. From 1921 to 2019 and returning in 2021, the Race to Mackinac has run consecutively every year, remains the longest annual freshwater distance race, and is recognized as one of the most prestigious sailing races in the world.

Today, sailors from Maine to California make this race an invariable part of their summer. Moreover, each year the Mac hosts sailors from as far off as Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia. Although the Mac remains primarily an amateur event, this race has a proven track record of attracting some of the finest sailing talent in the sport.. The monohull record of 22 hours, 24 minutes, and 23 seconds set by Team Maverick in 2024, and Steve Fossett on Stars and Stripes set the multihull record of 18 hours, 50 minutes, and 32 seconds in 1998. Both records still stand today. The unpredictable weather and fickle winds on Lake Michigan make the Race to Mackinac a supreme test, which many competitors feel rivals any ocean race. As one veteran sailor put it, &quot;It&#x27;s fun, but it&#x27;s serious fun.&quot;

2008 marked the 110th anniversary of the first race, and the 100th time sailors raced 333 miles from Chicago to Mackinac Island. Although there have been changes to the race over the years, the basic elements of this venerable contest have remained unchanged for over 100 years. Stripped down to its essence, The Mac, like all sailboat racing, is still primarily a test of strength, endurance, strategy and willpower. And let&#x27;s not forget the dearest friend (and most menacing foe) of all sailors—the wind.&quot;

The Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac Race is often confused with the Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race. They were held on the same weekend until 1939, when both clubs agreed to alternate the date of their Mackinac races, scheduling them a week apart.

The 104th running of the race began on July 21, 2012. 320 boats were entered in the race. All boats completed the race. The Mackinac Trophy was won by &quot;Providence&quot;, owned by Greg and Jerry Miarecki, representing the Chicago Yacht Club. The Mackinac Cup was won by Tom &amp; Joe Londrigan&#x27;s &quot;Realt Na Mara&quot;. George and Scott Petriz won the Double Handed division in &quot;TFWB Relentless&quot;. Lori &amp; Jonathan Alvord won the multihull division in &quot;Triceratops&quot;. The Chicago Yacht Club&#x27;s Ron White won the Martin D. Rieck Trophy for the first multihull to finish in &quot;Cheeke Monkey&quot;. The Royono Trophy, given for the first monohull to finish, was won by Peter Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Il Mostro&quot;, representing the Chicago Yacht Club. In the Cruising division, &quot;Intuition&quot;, owned by Tom Kershner, Mark Gillespie, Chris Hynes, Bill Burns, and Jenn Macainag from Madison, Wisconsin, won the 42 boat division. &quot;Infinite Diversion&quot;, a Hanse 630e owned by Chicago Yacht Club Commodore Joe Haas, was first to finish in the Cruising Division.

2020 saw the race going on hiatus, and plans to return the next year. It was the first time in a century that it was cancelled.

===Incidents===

On night of Sunday, 17 July 2011 - during the 103rd running of the race - two sailors died when &quot;WingNuts&quot;, a high performance keeled sportsboat Kiwi 35, (berthed in Saginaw, Michigan) capsized and turtled in 75 mile per hour winds. These were the first race-related fatalities in the history of the race. Later inquiry said that the boat specifically its high performance extremely wide low displacement hull was unfit for the location, weather and the multiday and lengthy race, and urged race officials to change ratings and revoke privileges to enter the race. The waves were not all that unusual, although the wind was. The boat may have buried one of its hiking wings into a wave, causing it to &#x27;trip,&#x27; and had the other lifted by the wind. It is rare but not unheard of for keelboats to turtle and remain upside down, particularly if it has not lost its keel. However, this boat&#x27;s unique hull form, which made it very fast, also rendered it more stable upside down than right side up. This was a recipe for the disaster. This loss was occasioned despite a competent and experienced crew which was as well equipped and prepared as thought to be necessary. &quot;WingNuts&quot; met then current offshore stability standards, which failed to adequately take into account the effect of the &quot;radical&quot; winged hull. 

In the 110th running of the race on July 21, 2018, Jon Santarelli, a 53-year-old sailor aboard the Transpac 52 sailing vessel &quot;Imedi&quot; slipped overboard during a wave strike approximately beyond the start line. After a nearly seven-hour search by approximately 20 boats and three helicopters from the US Coast Guard, Chicago Fire, Chicago Police, Chicago Yacht Club, and competing vessels covering nearly 47 square miles, the search was suspended, and Santarelli was presumed lost. On the afternoon of July 28, 2018 - nearly a week after the original incident - his body was recovered by a Chicago Police Marine Unit approximately offshore from Belmont Harbor and identified by the Cook County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office as Santarelli.

==Race management==
The Race to Mackinac is organized and managed by the Mac Committee, a group of active Chicago Yacht Club member-volunteers. The committee represents the club as the Race Organizing Authority and is led by the chairman. The committee planning process is 12 months long and accounts for thousands of volunteer hours.

The first Mackinac Chairman was Mark H. Baxter (1972-73 &amp; 1977–78). Since then there have been over twenty individuals who have led this venerable race. The Mackinac chairpersons have included some notables: At the age of 36, the youngest chairman ever to serve was Gregory J. Miarecki (2008–09), who coincidentally chaired the 100th running of the venerable race in 2008 along with Honorary Chair Roy E. Disney. The first &quot;chairwoman&quot; was Ms. Ann Moorman (1994–95). The first Hispanic to be appointed chairman was Louis Sandoval (2012–13). Two individuals who have served as chair have gone on to become Commodore of Chicago Yacht Club- Gregory J. Miarecki (2015-2016) and Louis Sandoval (2019-2020 ).

==Advances in race technology==
The Race to Mackinac has led in the use of technology in distance racing. In 2004, they debuted race tracking systems on select boats in the fleet. By 2006, with advances in technology and smaller sized components, trackers and race tracking interface using GPS transceivers became standard on each boat. Today, each boat is equipped with small palm sized messenger/trackers that allow two-way communication of each boat&#x27;s position on the race course and limited messaging capabilities.

==Island Goats Sailing Society==
Sailors who have completed 25 or more of these annual races may apply for membership in the Island Goat Sailing Society and are referred to as &quot;Old Goats&quot; or &quot;Island Goats&quot;. In 1959, the Island Goats Sailing Society was formed with 10 of these sailors to perpetuate and commemorate the Chicago to Mackinac Race, along with its legends and lore. By 2019, the society had grown to 390 members in good standing. In mid-July 1962, the race was won by Clare S. Jacobs, former 1908 London Olympic Pole Vaulting Bronze Medalist and founder of the F. L. Jacobs Company, though the time was slow, and Jacobs&#x27;s &quot;Falcon II&quot; was given a handicap as it was smaller than several other competitors.

<text>The Competition Commission was a non-departmental public body responsible for investigating mergers, markets and other enquiries related to regulated industries under competition law in the United Kingdom. It was a competition regulator under the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). It was tasked with ensuring healthy competition between companies in the UK for the ultimate benefit of consumers and the economy.

The Competition Commission replaced the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on 1 April 1999. It was created by the Competition Act 1998, although the majority of its powers were governed by the Enterprise Act 2002.

The Enterprise Act 2002 gave the Competition Commission wider powers and greater independence than the MMC had previously, so that it could make decisions on inquiries rather than giving recommendations to Government, and was also responsible for taking appropriate actions and measures (known as remedies) following inquiries which had identified competition problems.

The Government was still able to intervene on mergers that involve a specified public interest criterion such as media plurality, national security and financial stability.

On 1 April 2014, the Competition Commission was replaced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which also took over several responsibilities of the Office of Fair Trading.

==History==
The Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission was set up on 1 January 1949, in response to the recommendations of several committees of inquiry into restrictive commercial activity. It was established under the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act 1948. It was reconstituted as the Monopolies Commission on 31 October 1956 by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1955, which also set up a Restrictive Practices Court and a registrar of restrictive trading agreements. The commission was again reconstituted, and its powers extended, by the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965. In 1969 oversight of the Commission passed to the Department of Employment and Productivity, and in 1970 to the Department of Trade and Industry. Under the Fair Trading Act 1973 the Commission became, from 1 November 1973, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, with wider powers to deal with references either from the Office of Fair Trading or from the Department of Trade and Industry. On 1 April 1999, as a result of the Competition Act 1998, it became the Competition Commission.

==Role==

The Competition Commission (CC) was an independent public body which conducts in-depth inquiries into mergers, markets and the regulation of the major regulated industries, ensuring healthy competition between companies in the UK for the benefit of companies, customers and the economy.

All of the CC&#x27;s inquiries were undertaken following a reference made by another authority, most often the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) (which referred merger and market inquiries), or one of the sector regulators (which could refer markets within their sectoral jurisdictions or make regulatory references in relation to price controls and other licence modifications) or as a result of an appeal from a decision of one of the sector regulators.

==Mergers==

Under the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Enterprise Act), the OFT could review mergers to investigate whether there was a realistic prospect that they would lead to a substantial lessening of competition (SLC), unless it obtained undertakings from the merging parties to address its concerns or the market was of insufficient importance.

To qualify for investigation by the OFT, a merger needed to meet all three of the following criteria:
# two or more enterprises must cease to be distinct;
# the merger must not have taken place already, or must have taken place not more than four months ago; and
# one of the following must be true:
#* the business being taken over has a turnover in the UK of at least £70 million; or
#* the combined businesses supply (or acquire) at least 25 per cent of a particular product or service in the UK (or in a substantial part of the UK), and the merger results in an increase in the share of supply or consumption.

In exceptional cases where public interest issues are raised, the Secretary of State could also refer mergers to the CC.

Where an inquiry was referred to the CC for in-depth investigation, the CC had wide-ranging powers to remedy any competition concerns, including preventing a merger from going ahead. It could also require a company to sell off part of its business or take other steps to improve competition.

==Market investigations==

The Enterprise Act 2002 enabled the OFT (and the sector regulators) to investigate markets and, if they were concerned that there may be competition problems, to refer those markets to the CC for in-depth investigation.

In market investigations the CC had to decide whether any feature or combination of features in a market prevents, restricts or distorts competition, thus constituting an adverse effect on competition (AEC). Before finding out what percentage firms take up, the CC has to &#x27;define the market&#x27;. This is when they have to find out which products are in which industries so they know what percentage to do.

If the CC concluded that this was the case, it was required to seek to remedy the problems that it identified either by introducing remedies itself or by recommending action by others.

==Reviews of undertakings or orders==

Undertakings or orders are the primary means by which remedies were given effect under the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Fair Trading Act 1973. The OFT had the statutory duty to keep these undertakings or orders under review and if it considered that due to a change of circumstances a set of undertakings or an order should be varied or terminated, then the OFT referred it for consideration by the CC. Responsibility for deciding on variation or termination of undertakings lay with the CC.

==Regulatory references==

In relation to regulatory references, the CC&#x27;s role was dictated by the relevant sector-specific legislation. Companies regulated under the gas, electricity, water and sewerage, postal services, railways or airports legislation generally had a formal instrument (a licence) setting out the terms of their operation. If a regulated company did not agree to a modification of its licence proposed by the regulator, the regulator was required to refer the question to the CC. The CC then considered whether any matter referred to in the reference could be expected to operate against the public interest and, if so, whether it could be remedied by modifications to the licence. These references could involve the price control applied to the company.

The CC also had roles under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and the Legal Services Act 2007.

==Energy code modifications and Communications Act appeals==

The CC had an appeal function following decisions by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to modify certain energy codes under the Energy Act 2004 and in relation to price control decisions by Ofcom, following a reference by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) under the Communications Act 2003.

<text>Heart Wirral (formerly Wirral&#x27;s Buzz) was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the Wirral Peninsula, sharing its facilities with Heart Wrexham and Gold, in Gwersyllt, Wrexham.

==History==
The station, owned by Global Radio (originally by Marcher Radio Group), broadcast a mix of popular music and presenter chat. Launched in 1989 as &quot;MFM 97.1&quot; (an opt-out service from the main Marcher Sound output), the station relaunched as &quot;Wirral&#x27;s Buzz&quot; on 14 February 1999, before becoming &quot;Heart Wirral&quot; in 2009. The station was broadcast from the Storeton transmitter on Storeton ridge in Higher Bebington. Although the area of the licence was Wirral, it could be received as far east as Warrington and as far west as Ruthin in the Heart Wrexham region.

In November 2005, it was announced that GCap&#x27;s former Marcher Radio Group stations, including &quot;Buzz&quot;, were to be sold. This was due to the fact that they were outside of the company&#x27;s primary target area, however in 2006 GCap decided to call off the sales. Up until June 2008, the station&#x27;s line-up of networked shows featured some programming from the Century lineup such as Hairbrush Divas. Century&#x27;s former owner Capital Radio merged with Buzz&#x27;s former owner GWR to form GCap Media.

==Closure==
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart Wirral and merge the station with Heart Cheshire and North East Wales and Heart North Wales Coast as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 15. &quot;Heart North West and Wales&quot;, began broadcasting from Wrexham on Friday 2 July 2010.

Following Global&#x27;s purchase of the Real Radio and Smooth Radio stations from GMG Radio in 2012, Heart North West and Wales was replaced by &quot;Capital North West and Wales&quot;, as the previous &quot;Real Radio North West&quot; and &quot;Real Radio Wales&quot; stations were rebranded as &quot;Heart North West&quot; and &quot;Heart Wales&quot;, along with the rest of the Real Radio network of stations.

<doc id="941706" wikidata="Q4294210" url="?curid=941706" title="Cortical minicolumn">
<text>A cortical minicolumn (also called cortical microcolumn) is a vertical column through the cortical layers of the brain. Neurons within the microcolumn &quot;receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected, and may well constitute a fundamental computational unit of the cerebral cortex&quot;. Minicolumns comprise perhaps 80–120 neurons, except in the primate primary visual cortex (V1), where there are typically more than twice the number. There are about 2×108 minicolumns in humans. From calculations, the diameter of a minicolumn is about 28–40 μm. Minicolumns grow from progenitor cells within the embryo and contain neurons within multiple layers (2–6) of the cortex.

Many sources support the existence of minicolumns, especially Mountcastle, with strong evidence reviewed by Buxhoeveden and Casanova who conclude &quot;... the minicolumn must be considered a strong model for cortical organization&quot; and &quot;[the minicolumn is] the most basic and consistent template by which the neocortex organizes its neurones, pathways, and intrinsic circuits&quot;.

Cells in 50 μm minicolumn all have the same receptive field; adjacent minicolumns may have different fields.

== Number of neurons ==
Estimates of number of neurons in a minicolumn range from 80–100 neurons.

Jones describes a variety of observations that may be interpreted as mini- or micro-columns and gives example numbers from 11 to 142 neurons per minicolumn.

== Number of minicolumns ==
Estimates of the number of neurons in cortex or in neocortex are on the order of 2×1010. Most (perhaps 90%) of cortical neurons are neocortical neurons.

Johansson and Lansner use an estimate of 2×1010 neurons in the neocortex and an estimate of 100 neurons per minicolumn, yielding an estimate of 2×108 minicolumns.

Sporns et al. give an estimate of 2×107 – 2×108 minicolumns.

== Size of minicolumns ==
The minicolumn measures of the order of 40–50 μm in transverse diameter; 35–60 μm; 50 μm with 80 μm spacing, or 30 μm with 50 μm. Larger sizes may not be of human minicolumns, for example macaque monkey V1 minicolumns are 31 μm diameter, with 142 pyramidal cells — 1270 columns per mm2. Similarly, the cat V1 has much bigger minicolumns, ~56 μm.

The size can also be calculated from area considerations. If cortex (both hemispheres) is 1.27×1011 μm2 then if there are 2×108 minicolumns in the neocortex then each is 635 μm2, giving a diameter of 28 μm (if the cortex area were doubled to the commonly quoted value, this would rise to 40 μm). Johansson and Lansner do a similar calculation and arrive at 36 μm (p51, last para).

Downwards projecting axons in minicolumns are ≈10 μm in diameter, periodicity and density similar to those within the cortex, but not necessarily coincident.

<text>The Leaky Establishment is a novel by David Langford, first published in June 1984 by Frederick Muller Ltd () and re-issued, with an introduction by Terry Pratchett, in 2001 by Big Engine, then July 2003 by Cosmos Books (). 
The book draws on some of Langford&#x27;s own experiences working at the United Kingdom government&#x27;s Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, Berkshire.

== Plot introduction==
Roy Tappen works for the Robinson Heath Nuclear Utilisation Technology Centre, a nuclear weapons facility in Britain. He fights bureaucracy while trying to use it for his purpose, which is to undo the potentially disastrous results of a practical joke gone wrong.

Smuggling plutonium out of a nuclear research centre turns out to be surprisingly easy. The difficult part is smuggling it back in again without getting caught.

<doc id="941711" wikidata="Q5691951" url="?curid=941711" title="Capital Anglesey &amp; Gwynedd">
<text>Capital North Wales (formerly known as Capital Cymru) is a local radio station owned and operated by Global. The station broadcasts to Anglesey and Gwynedd via the Arfon transmitting station.

Previously, the station formed part of the Heart network, and earlier, the Marcher Radio Group. It switched to the Capital network on 6 May 2014. Heart North and Mid Wales now covers the region as part of the Heart network.

==Overview==
Although the official transmission area takes in most of the Isle of Anglesey and a large part of Gwynedd (as far south as Harlech), the location of its transmitter means the signal carries across Cardigan Bay and can be heard in parts of Pembrokeshire and even in Ireland. Capital Cymru is also available on the North West Wales local DAB digital radio multiplex—broadcasting alongside the North Wales Coast feed of Capital North West and Wales.

Up until February 21, 2025, the station aired local programming in the Welsh language with the Capital network&#x27;s playlist tweaked to include contemporary Welsh language music.

==History==
When it launched in December 1998 as Champion 103, it was the first commercial radio station to serve Anglesey and Gwynedd as a whole, although Marcher Coast 96.3 had been broadcasting to a small part of the area for some time from its Colwyn Bay studios.

Originally owned and operated by the Marcher Radio Group, Champion 103 broadcast from studios at Parc Menai in Bangor, Gwynedd - later sharing its facilities with Coast 96.3. In 2000, the four Marcher stations - including Champion - were brought by the GWR Group and became part of The One Network.

In March 2009, following Global Radio&#x27;s takeover of GCap Media, Champion was rebranded as Heart Cymru as part of a rollout of the Heart network across 29 local radio stations owned by Global. By this point, local programming had been reduced to ten hours on weekdays and seven hours at weekends.

In July 2010, Global closed the Bangor studios and moved Heart Cymru&#x27;s operations to the former Marcher headquarters in Gwersyllt, near Wrexham. By this point, the three Heart stations serving North Wales Coast, Cheshire &amp; North East Wales and the Wirral were merged into one regional station, Heart North West and Wales. Heart Cymru was not affected by the network restructuring.

On 6 February 2014, Global announced that Heart Cymru would be rebranded as Capital, with the North Wales licence of Real Radio Wales being sold to Communicorp and relaunched as a new separate Heart station for North and Mid Wales.

Capital Cymru was launched on 6 May 2014. All local output, including extended Welsh language shows, news bulletins and network opt-outs were retained.

On 23 May 2019, Capital Cymru dropped all of Capital&#x27;s networked programming and introduced a full schedule of local output, including an additional Welsh-language daytime show. The station retained both the Capital branding and the tweaked CHR music playlist.

&quot;The Official Big Top 40&quot;, simulcast on Heart North Wales, continued to air on Sunday afternoons. Outside programming hours, the station broadcast automated output, including a full hour of Welsh language music at 5am on weekday mornings.

In January 2025, it was reported that Capital Cymru would lose all of its Welsh language programming following the broadcast regulator Ofcom&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations for commercial radio, apart from news.

The station ended local programming in Welsh at 7pm on 21 February 2025 before resuming network programming from London two days later, effectively becoming a relay of Capital North West and North Wales. It now simulcasts a national drivetime show for Wales on weekdays, presented by Josh Andrews and Kally Davies and broadcast from Global&#x27;s Cardiff Bay studios. Local news and traffic bulletins were retained.

==Programming==
Most networked programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters.

National programming for Wales is produced and broadcast from Global&#x27;s Cardiff Bay studios on weekdays from 4-7pm. presented by Josh Andrews and Kally Davies.

===News===
Global’s Cardiff Bay newsroom broadcasts hourly localised news updates from 6am–6pm on weekdays and 8am–12 midday at weekends.

<doc id="941717" wikidata="Q6467568" url="?curid=941717" title="Labour – Federation of Labour Groups">
<text>Labour – Federation of Labour Groups is the formally registered name of a collection of political organisations in Northern Ireland who aspire to become part of the Labour Party of Great Britain.

==Background==
The British Labour Party did not organise or allow membership in Northern Ireland from the early 1920s till 2003 (although before the First World War one of the earliest Labour Party conferences was held in Belfast). For many years this gap was filled by the Northern Ireland Labour Party which had links to the British party and, from 1949 was explicitly in favour of the Union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. At the same time the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party had branches in Northern Ireland, the latter being the Ulster Unionists.

The Troubles led to a major realignment in the politics of Northern Ireland, with the Ulster Unionists breaking away from the Conservatives whilst both Northern Ireland Labour and Liberals declined to virtual electoral insignificance. Many in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain began to campaign for the major British political parties to allow membership, organise and run for election in Northern Ireland, in the hope of bringing a further realignment that would move political discourse away from total domination by The Border Question.

In the case of the British Labour Party this campaign had long run up against the party&#x27;s former policy that Northern Ireland should be given over to the Republic of Ireland and Labour&#x27;s relations with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Labour maintained a ban on residents of Northern Ireland joining the party, despite allowing residents of anywhere else in the world the right to join. Despite this a number of activists formed local groups such as the South Belfast Constituency Labour Party or the Foyle Labour Group. These groups contested elections in the province as &quot;Labour&quot;.

Legislation now requires political parties to formally register in order to use a party description on ballot papers. The local groups are formally registered as &quot;Labour – Federation of Labour Groups&quot;.

In 2003 the trade unionist Andy McGivern initiated legal proceedings against the Labour Party, contending that the ban on membership breached the 1998 Human Rights Act. The Labour National Executive took legal advice and came to the conclusion that the courts would impose a change on the party; to pre-empt this the 2003 Labour Party Conference passed the appropriate rules changes to allow party membership.

However the Labour Party continued to refuse to organise in Northern Ireland, and so the local Labour groups continued their pressure. With the prospect of further legal action challenging the legality of the national party&#x27;s decision, the Labour Party established an officially recognised branch in Northern Ireland in 2009.

<doc id="941745" wikidata="Q2495836" url="?curid=941745" title="Cortical column">
<text>A cortical column is a group of neurons forming a cylindrical structure through the cerebral cortex of the brain perpendicular to the cortical surface. The structure was first identified by Vernon Benjamin Mountcastle in 1957. He later identified minicolumns as the basic units of the neocortex which were arranged into columns. Each contains the same types of neurons, connectivity, and firing properties. Columns are also called hypercolumn, macrocolumn, functional column or sometimes cortical module. Neurons within a minicolumn (microcolumn) encode similar features, whereas a hypercolumn &quot;denotes a unit containing a full set of values for any given set of receptive field parameters&quot;. A cortical module is defined as either synonymous with a hypercolumn (Mountcastle) or as a tissue block of multiple overlapping hypercolumns.

Cortical columns are proposed to be the canonical microcircuits for predictive coding, in which the process of cognition is implemented through a hierarchy of identical microcircuits. The evolutionary benefit to this duplication allowed human neocortex to increase in size by almost 3-fold over just the last 3 million years.

The columnar hypothesis states that the cortex is composed of discrete, modular columns of neurons, characterized by a consistent connectivity profile. The columnar organization hypothesis is currently the most widely adopted to explain the cortical processing of information.

==Mammalian cerebral cortex==

The mammalian cerebral cortex, the grey matter encapsulating the white matter, is composed of layers. The human cortex is between 2 and 3 mm thick. The number of layers is the same in most mammals, but varies throughout the cortex. 6 layers can be recognized in the neocortex, although many regions lack one or more layers. For example, fewer layers are present in the archipallium and the paleopallium.

===Columnar functional organization===
The columnar functional organization, as originally framed by Vernon Mountcastle, suggests that neurons that are horizontally more than 0.5 mm (500 μm) from each other do not have overlapping sensory receptive fields, and other experiments give similar results: 200–800 μm. Various estimates suggest there are 50 to 100 cortical minicolumns in a hypercolumn, each comprising around 80 neurons. Their role is best understood as &#x27;functional units of information processing.&#x27;

An important distinction is that the columnar organization is functional by definition, and reflects the local connectivity of the cerebral cortex. Connections &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; within the thickness of the cortex are much denser than connections that spread from side to side.

==Hubel and Wiesel studies==
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel followed up on Mountcastle&#x27;s discoveries in the somatic sensory cortex with their own studies in vision. A part of the discoveries that resulted in them winning the 1981 Nobel Prize was that there were cortical columns in vision as well, and that the neighboring columns were also related in function in terms of the orientation of lines that evoked the maximal discharge. Hubel and Wiesel followed up on their own studies with work demonstrating the impact of environmental changes on cortical organization, and the sum total of these works resulted in their Nobel Prize.

==Number of cortical columns==
There are about 200 million (2×108) cortical minicolumns in the human neocortex with up to about 110 neurons each, and with estimates of 21–26 billion (2.1×1010–2.6×1010) neurons in the neocortex. With 50 to 100 cortical minicolumns per cortical column a human would have 2–4 million (2×106–4×106) cortical columns. There may be more if the columns can overlap, as suggested by Tsunoda &quot;et al&quot;. Jeff Hawkins claims that there are only 150,000 columns in the human neocortex, based on research made by his company Numenta.

There are claims that minicolumns may have as many as 400 principal cells, but it is not clear if that includes glia cells.

Some contradict the previous estimates, claiming the original research is too arbitrary. The authors propose a uniform neocortex, and choose a fixed width and length to calculate the cell numbers. Later research pointed out that the neocortex is indeed not uniform for other species, and studying nine primate species they found that &quot;the number of neurons underneath 1 mm2 of the cerebral cortical surface ... varies by three times across species.&quot; The neocortex is not uniform across species. The actual number of neurons within a single column is variable, and depends on the cerebral areas and thus the function of the column.

<text>Heart Hertfordshire (previously known as &quot;Hertfordshire&#x27;s Mercury 96.6&quot;) is an Independent Local Radio station owned by Communicorp UK and operated by Global as part of the Heart network. It broadcasts across Hertfordshire.

In 2005, it was sold by GCap Media to the Adventure Radio Company although it still carried programming from GCap&#x27;s successors Global as well as having its website maintained by Global. The station was rebranded on Monday 26 July 2010, but as it is not owned outright by Global, it operates as a franchise.

In 2019, the station merged with BOB fm in north Hertfordshire and began broadcasting to the entire county.

==History==
The Radio Authority in 1993 advertised thirteen new local radio licences across the UK, one being awarded to the &quot;St Albans and Watford Broadcasting Company&quot;, a wholly owned subsidiary of the former Chiltern Radio Network. Based in Hatfield Road, St Albans and promising &quot;classic and contemporary hits, sport, local and national news&quot;, Oasis Radio went on-air on 22 October 1994 as a complementary sister station to Chiltern Radio (Herts, Beds and Bucks)- both stations being receivable in its target area. Oasis played softer adult contemporary music than &quot;The Hot FM&quot; format from Chiltern.

In 1996, the GWR Group acquired the Chiltern Radio Network along with Oasis Radio, which was relaunched as &quot;The New 96.6FM&quot; – &quot;Classic Hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s&quot;. The station took on the same sound as the rest of its &#x27;Mix Network&#x27; group of stations, albeit with more 1970s tracks.

In 1997, the station was sold to Essex Radio plc and relaunched as &quot;96.6 Oasis FM&quot;. Advertisements were taken out in local newspapers such as the &quot;Watford Chronicle&quot; and on the backs of buses in the area to inform listeners that they were &quot;back after the break&quot; – a cheeky comment on the previous management&#x27;s incarnation, which did not have a proper name (The New 96.6FM) and which never really captured the listener&#x27;s imagination. Capital Radio started selling advertising space on behalf of the newly relaunched station, which moved to the Christopher Place Shopping Centre in St Albans.

In 1999, the station changed again. The Daily Mail and General Trust bought Essex Radio plc under its sub-division DMG Radio Ltd. This meant another name change to Mercury FM 96.6 – a name shared by other stations in the company&#x27;s portfolio, which were:

*Mercury FM 102.7 – Reigate and Crawley
*Mercury FM 96.2 &amp; 101.6 – West Kent and North Surrey
*Mercury FM 101.7 – Harlow
*Mercury FM 107.9 – Medway Towns, Kent

and paired off with the flagship station Essex FM. Each station used the slogan of &quot;Hotter and Fresher&quot;, signifying a shift towards a more contemporary slant in the station&#x27;s music policy. The semi-network was disbanded after the GWR Group bought DMG Radio in 2002, in effect re-purchasing Mercury 96.6. The Mercury stations in Medway and West Kent were sold to the Kent Messenger Group.

In 2003, Mercury 96.6 moved from St Albans to an industrial estate on the outskirts of Watford in an attempt to re-focus the station as a Watford-only station. This was due to the then Radio Authority regulations on local ownership of stations as the GWR Group already owned Chiltern FM, which has overlapping coverage in the St Albans and Hemel Hempstead areas. This move was in a bid to hold on to the station before the outgoing Radio Authority was replaced by Ofcom and in a bid to compete with then rival Capital Radio in London. Mercury FM by then took on the &quot;Better Music Mix&quot; format that originated from GWR in Bristol.

In 2005, the St Albans and Watford Broadcasting Company was divested to a new company, Adventure Radio Holdings, an entertainment consortium that owns a theme park in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and four other radio stations, including two in Essex. Despite its relatively independent status, the station was rebranded from Mercury 96.6 to Heart on Monday 26 July 2010 and switched to a softer adult contemporary music format. The changes coincided with a restructuring of Heart. Up until July 2010, the station formed part of Global&#x27;s The Hit Music Network, broadcasting a mix of locally produced output from Watford and networked programming from Nottingham.

In July 2016, the station owners Adventure Island signed a management contract with Communicorp that would see them offer extra support to both Heart Hertfordshire and Connect FM.

In February 2019, Adventure Radio sold the station to Communicorp. Two months later, Communicorp acquired Shadow Radio Holdings, the owners of BOB fm in north Hertfordshire.

On 31 May 2019, BOB fm ceased broadcasting and became a relay of Heart Hertfordshire. The merger coincided with the end of Heart&#x27;s local breakfast and weekend programming.

As of 24 February 2025 all programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;Heart Drive&quot;, presented each weekday by JK and Kelly Brook.

<text>Heart South Devon (formerly South Hams Radio) was an Independent Local Radio station serving the South Hams area of Devon, England. The station began broadcasting on 1 December 1999 and until its closure, was run as a joint venture between UKRD Group and Global Radio from studios at South Hams Business Park at Churchstow, Kingsbridge.

The station&#x27;s main frequency was on 101.2 FM, broadcast initially from Bolberry Down near Hope Cove, but later moving to a site near Soar in 2003. The station also broadcast from three relay transmitters at Totnes (100.5FM), Dartmouth (100.8FM) and Ivybridge (101.9FM). In 2017, the main transmitter on 101.2FM was moved from Soar to the Kingsbridge TV relay site near West Alvington.

Some of the Presenters on South Hams Radio included David FitzGerald, Pat Holness, David James, Rob Wheeler, Lisa Hartwell, Dave Gould, Chris Batchelor, Matt Lissack, Carmella Mckenzie, Craig Armet, John Coates, and Graham Russell.

==History==
On Monday 23 March 2009, South Hams Radio became Heart South Devon, as part of the Heart Network. By this time, most of the station&#x27;s programming was produced in London, with the only local shows being the breakfast and drivetime shows during the week.

On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart South Devon and merge the station with Heart Plymouth, Heart Exeter and Heart Torbay and Heart North Devon as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new station, &quot;Heart Devon&quot;, began broadcasting from Exeter on Friday 27 August 2010.

<text>Eugenio Monti (23 January 1928 – 1 December 2003) was an Italian bobsledder and alpine skier. He is one of the most successful athletes in the history of the bobsleigh, with ten World championship medals (of which nine gold) and 6 Olympic medals including two golds. He is known also for his acts of sportsmanship during the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, which made him the first athlete ever to receive the Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy.

==Biography==
Born in Toblach, Italy, &quot;The Flying Redhead&quot; was the best Italian young skier: he won the national titles in slalom and giant slalom, and finished third in downhill, but a 1951 accident stopped his alpine skiing career when he tore ligaments in both of his knees. Monti switched to bobsleigh, finding great success as a result. In 1954 he won his first Italian championship and in 1957 won his first world championship.

At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, he won silver medals in the 2-man and 4-man bobsled events. He could not compete in the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, because the bobsled race was not held for economic reasons (for the only time in the history of the Winter Olympic Games).

But it was during the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck that Monti performed the best-known act of his sporting career. Realizing that British bobsledders Tony Nash and Robin Dixon had broken a bolt on their sled, Monti lent them the bolt off his sled. The Britons won the gold medal in the 2-man bobsled, while Monti and his teammate took the bronze medal. Answering critics from the home press, Monti told them &quot;Nash didn&#x27;t win because I gave him the bolt. He won because he had the fastest run.&quot; Monti also showed his act of selfless generosity in the four-man competition. There, the Canadian team of Vic Emery had damaged their sled&#x27;s axle and would have been disqualified had not Monti and his mechanics come to the rescue. The sled was repaired and the Canadian team went on to win the gold medal, while Monti&#x27;s team took bronze. For these acts of sportsmanship, he was awarded the Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy.

Finally, at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, a 40-year-old Monti won a gold in both the two-man and four-man events (the first non-German to do so). After his victory, he received Italy&#x27;s highest civilian honor – the Commendatore of the Italian Republic and then retired to labor in his skiing facilities in Cortina.

Struck by numerous hardships (separation from his wife, the departure of his daughter for the United States, the death of his son from an overdose), suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, on 30 November 2003 he shot himself in the head; transported to the hospital in Belluno, he died the next day.

Turn 19 at Cesana Pariol, the site of the 2006 Winter Olympic bobsled, luge, and skeleton competitions, was named for Monti. The bobsleigh track that Monti competed on for years in Cortina and is slated for the 2026 Winter Olympics was renamed in his honor following his 2003 death.

<doc id="941833" wikidata="Q5691914" url="?curid=941833" title="Heart Bristol">
<text>Heart 96.3 (formerly GWR FM Bristol) was an Independent Local Radio station serving Bristol and surrounding areas and broadcasting on 96.3 MHz in Bristol and Weston-super-Mare. Launched in 1981 as Radio West, it was merged with neighbouring Wiltshire Radio and relaunched under the name GWR in 1985, retaining the name through several changes of ownership until rebranding in March 2009. Heart Bristol merged with sister stations in Somerset and Bath to form Heart West Country.

==History==

===Radio West===
Radio West began broadcasting on Tuesday 27 October 1981, eleven years after the region&#x27;s first local radio station BBC Radio Bristol launched. The station started a full service commercial radio station on 96.3 MHz FM and 1260 kHz AM (238 metres medium wave) – the culmination of a merger between two companies bidding for the Bristol and Bath radio licence (Radio Avonside and Bristol Channel) awarded by the then Independent Broadcasting Authority. The choice of on-air name proved to be simple when the BBC aired a series called &quot;Shoestring&quot; complete with the fictitious Radio West.

Headquartered in expensive studio premises in the Watershed complex on Bristol&#x27;s Harbourside, by 1983 the station had suffered losses of £300,000. The original senior management team left the station, with John Bradford moving from Radio Tees to take over as managing director and news editor Mike Stewart appointed programme controller. This resulted in considerable changes to the programme output and presentation line-up, including Roger Day (ex Caroline, Piccadilly, and BRMB) being brought in to host the breakfast show. By October 1983, the station was closing each evening at 7:30pm, but as the station became more mainstream, it was able to broadcast throughout the evening and also late night by the end of the following year.

Although the station was broadcasting programmes of a high quality (including award-nominated computer show Datarama), listeners remained loyal to the BBC&#x27;s Radio Bristol, already established as the radio station for the area.

Financially, commercial radio struggled to make any money as the 1980s economy in Britain was hampered by union strikes. Radio West had not made any profit since it started and looked set to close, when the neighbouring local station Wiltshire Radio, based in Swindon made an approach to merge the two stations, creating a station covering from Weston-super-Mare in the west to Swindon and Hungerford in the east, with opt out programming for the two areas. This merger was approved by the Independent Broadcasting Authority and was completed in September 1985.

The history of Radio West formed part of &#x27;Eddie Shoestring&#x27;s Bristol&#x27;, a documentary presented by Xander Brett for Burst Radio in 2022, featuring contributions from former CEO of Radio West and Wiltshire Radio Ralph Bernard, and former Radio West presenter Johnnie Walker. In a 2016 programme transmitted by BBC Radio 2, Walker credited Dave Cash with his chance to join Radio West

Radio West formally closed at just after midnight on Monday 9 September 1985 with a special final programme hosted by Trevor Fry and the final closedown announcement from Mark Seaman (the station&#x27;s programme organiser). Test transmissions for GWR commenced the next day before it launched as a 24-hour full service station at 6am on Monday 1 October 1985.

The new station aired separate output for Bristol and Wiltshire at breakfast and mid-morning. All other programmes came from the Wooton Bassett studios at the Lime Kiln. New disc jockeys were brought in, however the station still sounded like competitor Radio Bristol with its mix of music, news and talk (as was the trend in British commercial radio at the time due to needletime restrictions) and listening figures were not improving.

===Split services===
GWR Radio began splitting frequencies as required by the government – which declared its desire to end simulcasting on both FM and AM. GWR Radio launched Brunel Radio on 15 November 1988, a &quot;golden oldies&quot; station on 1260 kHz in Bristol, and 936/1161 kHz AM in Wiltshire. In the early 1990s Brunel started networking programming to 2CR Radio in Bournemouth and Radio 210 in Reading, Berkshire. Each station had Classic Gold appended to the end of their names (e.g. Brunel Classic Gold, 210 Classic Gold). Local news and shows were combined with networked programmes in each of its areas.

After the lifting on sanctions restricting the time spent playing music (so-called &#x27;needle time&#x27;) in 1988, GWR FM became more and more music-led, playing Top 40 chart music during the daytime, and specialist music (big band music, rock, rap etc.) was gradually phased out. The local element of the station, especially its news coverage, had progressively become briefer and reduced in length, then moved onto Brunel Classic Gold, before being dropped altogether. GWR FM at last become popular, with the rise in listening figures confirming this.

A Bath ILR licence was awarded by the IBA in 1986. GWR Radio Bath debuted on 22 May 1987, as a separate station, later known as Bath&#x27;s GWR FM and Heart Bath. All programming being shared from GWR Bristol, local output was provided for a time at breakfast only. However, for official licensing purposes, GWR Bath and Bristol were listed as one station and audience figures from RAJAR were combined with GWR Swindon. All programming for GWR Bath were broadcast from Bristol, but there was a small &#x27;GWR Bath&#x27; office in Avon Street at one time.

===The Mix Network===
In 1992, a re-launch of the station saw &quot;The New GWR-FM&quot; become the hub of what was &quot;The Mix Network&quot;, a network of radio stations owned by the GWR Group (latterly GCap Media) covering southern England and Wales. The radio station&#x27;s (and the group&#x27;s) long held philosophy of heavily researching the average person&#x27;s listening habits and tastes led by group chairman Ralph Bernard created a tightly formatted sound where popular Top 40 chart hits and ex-Top 40 songs were blended in with older hits. This led to a &quot;Better Music Mix&quot; format which spread to other radio stations within the GWR Group, including Essex FM, Trent FM and Beacon Radio creating a mini national network.

The practice for the Mix Network stations was for each station to play a centrally produced playlist (from GWR FM itself). Songs were broadcast at the same time as neighbouring group stations and each station adopted the &quot;Better Music Mix&quot; tagline, to be said by local disc jockeys in between songs. Fans of the previous guises of some stations bought by the GWR Group, notably &quot;Essex FM&quot; and &quot;Beacon Radio&quot; were unhappy at the sudden re-branding of the stations, accusing the new management of reducing local output such as news bulletins and replacing local programming with networked shows such as &quot;Late Night Love&quot; and &quot;The Request Fest&quot;, which originated from the Bristol studios.

Despite protests from outside Bristol, GWR FM continued to be popular with RAJAR listening figures showing an average 14% listening share of all radio broadcast in the area.

===Licence renewal===
In 2002, the Radio Authority renewed GWR FM&#x27;s licence. It was due to expire in October 2009, but was extended to expire on 28 October 2013, according to GWR FM licensees page. However it was automatically renewed because it provides a DAB simulcast signal. The same scenario applied to its sister stations GWR FM Bath and Classic Gold 1260.

===Weston-super-Mare relay===
In late 2007, GWR FM launched a relay of their Bristol service to the Weston-super-Mare area on 103.0 MHz FM, as for many years Weston had been officially covered by the station, but had suffered from a poor 96.3 MHz FM signal in many parts of the town. The programming on this relay was identical to the Bristol service, aside from jingles and sweepers that stated &#x27;GWR Weston&#x27;, and had separate advertisements for North Somerset listeners. This led to the somewhat confusing situation that although the station branding said &#x27;GWR Weston&#x27;, all DJ links reference &#x27;GWR Bristol&#x27; and feature Bristol oriented news, event guides and competitions.

===Ofcom yellow card===
On 13 March 2009, Ofcom issued GWR Bristol with a &quot;yellow card&quot; after a content sampling report showed that only 47% of GWR Bristol&#x27;s music was from the past 2 years, much lower than its minimum 75%.

===Network restructuring===
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to merge Heart Bristol with Heart Somerset and Heart Bath as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new station, &quot;Heart West Country&quot;, began broadcasting from Bristol on 16 July 2010.

==GWR acronym==
The initials GWR have an association with the Great Western Railway especially in the South West of England, and there is a popular misconception with listeners that the station stands for Great Western Radio. Indeed, neighbouring GWR Wiltshire was called Wiltshire Radio (WR) before its merger with Radio West. However, according to group management, the letters GWR did not stand for anything. In fact the station management at the time did try to secure the name Great Western Radio, however it was already the trading name of a Bristol electronics shop, who refused to relinquish the title.

It should also be noted that GWR&#x27;s oldies service was originally called Brunel Classic Gold, after the Great Western Railway&#x27;s founding father Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

==GWR Group==
The company which formerly owned GWR, the GWR Group, expanded from the late 1980s / early 1990s onwards to purchase other stations throughout the country. It became the largest radio company in the UK, before merging with its competitor Capital Radio to become GCap Media on 9 May 2005.

<text>Pnin () is Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s 13th novel and his fourth written in English; it was published in 1957. The success of &quot;Pnin&quot; in the United States launched Nabokov&#x27;s career into literary prominence. Its eponymous protagonist, Timofey Pavlovich Pnin, is a Russian-born assistant professor in his 50s living in the United States, whose character is believed to be based partially on the life of both Nabokov&#x27;s colleague Marc Szeftel as well as on Nabokov himself. Exiled by the Russian Revolution and what he calls the &quot;Hitler war&quot;, Pnin teaches Russian at the fictional Waindell College, loosely inspired by Cornell University and Wellesley College—places where Nabokov himself taught.

==Plot summary==

===Chapter 1===
Timofey Pavlovich Pnin, the title character, is a professor of Russian at Waindell College; &quot;ideally bald&quot; with a &quot;strong man torso,&quot; &quot;spindly legs,&quot; and &quot;feminine feet&quot;. Pnin is on a train from Waindell to Cremona, where he is to give a guest lecture. He is persistently bothered by the fear that he may lose his lecture papers, or mix them up with the student essay he is correcting. He discovers he has boarded the wrong train and gets off. When he tries to board a bus to Cremona, he suddenly realizes he has lost his luggage (with his papers) and has a seizure. He finally arrives at Cremona by truck, having recovered his papers, and is about to give his lecture when he experiences a vision, seeing his dead parents and friends from before the Russian Revolution in the audience.

===Chapter 2===
Laurence Clements, a fellow Waindell faculty member, and his wife Joan, are looking for a new lodger after their daughter Isabel has married and moved out. Pnin is the new tenant, informed of the vacancy by Waindell&#x27;s librarian, Mrs. Thayer. The Clementses grow to enjoy Pnin&#x27;s eccentricities and his idiosyncratic phrasings. There follows the history of Pnin&#x27;s relationship with his ex-wife Dr. Liza Wind, who manipulated him into bringing her to America so that she could leave him for fellow psychologist Eric Wind. Liza visits Pnin, but only wants to extract money from him for her son, Victor. Although Pnin is aware of her nature, he obliges out of love for her. After she leaves, Pnin weeps at her cruelty, shouting &quot;I haf nofing left, nofing, nofing!&quot;

===Chapter 3===
Pnin is alone at the Clementses&#x27; as they have gone to visit Isabel. The narrator describes Pnin&#x27;s past lodgings and his idiosyncratic English. Pnin lectures his Elementary Russian class, then goes to the library, where he ignores Mrs. Thayer&#x27;s attempts at small talk as he tries to return a book requested by another patron, but the record shows the requester to be Pnin himself. Pnin does research for his book on Russian culture, then attends the showing of a Soviet propaganda film, which causes him to weep. The chapter ends with the return of Isabel, who has left her husband. Pnin will have to find new lodgings.

===Chapter 4===
Fourteen-year-old Victor Wind dreams of a foreign king who refuses to abdicate and is exiled (foreshadowing &quot;Pale Fire&quot;). In his fantasy, this king, rather than Erik Wind, is his father. Victor is depicted as an intelligent, nonconformist boy with a great talent for drawing. His parents have him psychoanalyzed, and are incapable of understanding his artistic talent, much to the boy&#x27;s chagrin. Victor has little respect for his teachers at St. Bart&#x27;s except for Lake the art teacher, &quot;a tremendously obese man with shaggy eyebrows and hairy hands&quot;. Victor is to meet with Pnin at Waindell bus station, and Pnin hurriedly buys him a soccer ball and the Jack London novel &quot;The Son of the Wolf&quot;. Victor is not interested in soccer, and Pnin takes the entire encounter as a failure, unaware that Victor holds him in great admiration.

===Chapter 5===
Pnin drives to The Pines, the summer home of a friend, where the host and guests are Russian émigrés and their Americanized children. Among his friends, Pnin, normally out of place in English-speaking society, is at ease and displays his knowledge of Russian culture and ability at croquet. A mutual friend mentions Pnin&#x27;s former sweetheart, the Jewish Mira Belochkin, who was murdered at Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp. Another refers to Vladimir Vladimirovich, an expert on butterflies, who is later revealed to be the narrator of &quot;Pnin.&quot;

===Chapter 6===
Pnin invites the Clementses, Mrs. Thayer, several Waindell faculty members, and his former student Betty Bliss to a &quot;house-heating party&quot;. Pnin is considering buying the house from his landlord, but is informed by Dr. Hagen, the chair of his department, that a new department of Russian is to be formed, headed by a man under whom Pnin categorically refuses to work. Pnin almost breaks a magnificent glass punch bowl, a gift from Victor and a symbol of his regard.

===Chapter 7===
The identity of the narrator is revealed —a Russian-American academic and lepidopterist called Vladimir Vladimirovich. V.V. recounts his version of his meetings with Pnin, claiming that they first met when V.V. had an appointment with Pnin&#x27;s father, Pavel, an ophthalmologist. V.V. had an affair with Pnin&#x27;s ex-wife Liza just before Pnin&#x27;s marriage, disparaged her mediocre &quot;Akhmatovesque&quot; poetry, and drove her to attempt suicide. V.V. patronises Pnin, and many of his claims conflict with events V.V. himself narrated earlier in the book. V.V., the new head of the Waindell Russian department, wrote to Pnin to urge him to stay, but Pnin leaves Waindell, taking a stray dog with him. The novel closes with Jack Cockerell, head of English at Waindell, beginning to tell V.V. the story of Pnin bringing the wrong lecture papers to Cremona, bringing the narrative full circle.

==Background==

===Publication history===
&quot;Pnin&quot; was originally written as a series of sketches, and Nabokov originally began writing Chapter 2 in January 1954, around the same time &quot;Lolita&quot; was being finalized. Sections of &quot;Pnin&quot; were first published, in installments, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in order to generate income while Nabokov was scouring the United States for a publisher willing to publish &quot;Lolita&quot;. It was soon expanded, revised, and published in book form.

Nabokov&#x27;s original version of &quot;Pnin&quot;, which he sent to Viking, consisted of ten chapters and ended with Pnin&#x27;s untimely death from the heart problem he suffers at the beginning of the novel. However, editor Pascal Covici rejected the idea and Nabokov heavily revised the novel, then titling the work &quot;My Poor Pnin&quot;, before finally settling on the current title. According to Boyd, &quot;Pnin&quot; is Nabokov&#x27;s response to &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, which he had read a year earlier. Nabokov lambasted Cervantes for his cruelty to Quixote, seeming to encourage the reader to be amused by the eponymous character&#x27;s pain and humiliation. The title of the book, Boyd says, lends even more credence to this theory, as it sounds like and nearly spells &quot;pain&quot;.

===Influences===
The novel draws from Nabokov&#x27;s experience at American academic institutions, primarily Cornell, and it has been claimed that it is &quot;teeming&quot; with people and physical details from that university. The main character is based, in part, on Cornell Professor Marc Szeftel, who may have &quot;somewhat resented the resemblance&quot;. The description of the Waindell campus, however, better fits Wellesley.

Nabokov himself was capable of Pninian mistakes; according to his former student Alfred Appel: 

Galya Diment also notes another Pninian anecdote of Nabokov: 

In terms of literary influences, Pnin&#x27;s flight from Waindell in his blue car recalls Chichikov&#x27;s flight from town by wagon, at the end of the first part of Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;.

==Reception==
Contrary to popular belief, it was not &quot;Lolita&quot; that made Nabokov a well-known writer in the United States, but rather &quot;Pnin&quot;, which was published a year earlier (1957) in America. Although it did not become a mainstream novel as &quot;Lolita&quot; did, &quot;Pnin&quot; had a relatively wide readership in literary circles, garnering favourable reviews. Upon its second week of publication, &quot;Pnin&quot; had already begun its second printing, and Nabokov was referred to as &quot;one of the subtlest, funniest and most moving writers in the United States today&quot; by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. This was completely unprecedented for Nabokov, whose first two English-language novels, &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot; (1940) and &quot;Bend Sinister&quot; (1947), were largely ignored by the American public. &quot;Pnin&quot; was also a particular favourite of the Southern writer Flannery O&#x27;Connor (who provides the blurb in the Vintage edition), who found the story of the humorous Russian professor &quot;wonderful&quot;. &quot;Pnin&quot; was also a favorite of British writer Martin Amis, who ranked it fourth on his list of best Nabokov novels. &quot;Pnin&#x27;s&quot; success culminated in a nomination for the 1958 National Book Award for Fiction, the first of seven such nominations for Nabokov.

===Analysis===
A detail mentioned toward the end of Chapter 5 concerns the fate of Pnin&#x27;s first love, Mira Belochkin, a Jew murdered at Buchenwald concentration camp. (Nabokov&#x27;s wife, Véra, was also Jewish). Many Nabokov scholars, such as Boyd, David Vernon, Elena Sommers and Leona Toker, have pointed out the recurring motif of the squirrel in &quot;Pnin&quot; which follows him throughout the book - and that the name Belochkin is derived from the Russian diminutive for &quot;squirrel&quot;. William W. Rowe suggests that not only do the squirrels embody the &quot;resurrections&quot; of Pnin&#x27;s former love, but that the spirit of Mira can be found apart from the squirrels in the form of a &quot;mysterious observer&quot; who acts through the squirrels to oversee and influence the events in Pnin&#x27;s life. In a sense, via Belochkin and the recurring squirrel, &quot;Pnin&quot; constitutes a subtle addressal of the Holocaust, where many of Nabokov&#x27;s acquaintances and his own brother Sergey were killed. Boyd interprets Mira as the &quot;moral center of the novel&quot; and argues that in the confused reports of her generosity and fortitude in her last days &quot;she comes to represent humanity at its best and most vulnerable&quot;. Relevant to this is the American town of Cremona, where, the morally unreliable narrator of the story informs us, Pnin visited to speak to the women&#x27;s club at the beginning of the story; Cremona is the name of an Italian city that housed a &quot;displaced persons&quot; center where some Jews who survived the Nazi murders stayed, sometimes for more than a year, after the defeat of the Nazis, before being legally allowed to emigrate. In a similar fashion to the fictional Mira, Sergey Nabokov, who was taken to Neuengamme, exhibited tremendous conduct. According to Ivan Nabokov, Sergey &quot;was extraordinary. He gave away lots of packages he was getting, of clothes and food, to people who were really suffering.&quot;

Boyd noted Pnin&#x27;s sharp contrast with Nabokov&#x27;s most famous character, Humbert Humbert, from &quot;Lolita&quot;, which was written simultaneously with &quot;Pnin&quot;. Pnin is the anti-Humbert in every sense: where Humbert flatteringly depicts himself as tall, handsome and charming with perfect English, Pnin is relayed as stubby, rotund, odd-looking and with comically bad English. In their respective stories, Humbert seduces with secret monstrosity, while the seemingly vulgar Pnin is a saint in disguise. The contrast is highlighted in matrimony; Humbert manipulates and secretly loathes his wife Charlotte, contemplates killing her and ultimately breaks her heart and instigates her accidental demise. Pnin, inversely, is mistreated cruelly by his wife and ex-wife Liza Wind, for whom he bends over to do any favour out of selfless love. Lastly and most vividly, in their treatment of children: Humbert abducts and abuses his foster-child Dolores Haze, whom he belittles and plies with sweets, while Pnin by contrast is a caring and supportive figure to Liza&#x27;s son Victor Wind, who is in a sense his foster son. Fittingly, Dolores despises and resents Humbert and betrays him at the first opportunity, while Victor admires Pnin more than he realises and treasures his friendship, symbolised by the magnificent aquamarine glass bowl Victor purchases for Pnin in Chapter 6.

Arthur Mizener noted that whereas social isolation is often depicted as a negative consequence of characters’ behavior in most of Nabokov&#x27;s novels, Timofey Pnin, the Russian emigrant and protagonist of &quot;Pnin&quot;, seems to embrace it. Mizener claims that Pnin “carries on with easy confidence of success and a firm assurance of his own common sense” instead of wallowing in self-pity over his social isolation. In relation to his criticism towards the American society, Mizener indicates that Pnin&#x27;s “innocent self-confidence” illustrates the story&#x27;s “remarkable observation of American life”. As the narrator of the book mentions, &quot;It was the world that was absent-minded and it was Pnin whose business it was to set it straight.&quot;

<text>Mount Walter is the second highest named summit in the U.S. state of New Mexico, rising to 13,141 feet above sea level. However it is not usually counted as an independent mountain since it has only about of topographic prominence, and is only north-northeast of Wheeler Peak, the highest peak in New Mexico. Both peaks lie in the Taos Mountains, a subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which is in turn a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. They are also in the Wheeler Peak Wilderness of Carson National Forest.

<text>Heart Wiltshire (formerly GWR FM Wiltshire) was an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Heart network. It broadcast to north and west Wiltshire. The station was rebranded to Heart in March 2009 in line with Global Radio&#x27;s rebranding of most of the One Network, which the station was part of. Its local competitors were Sam FM, BBC Wiltshire and community radio station, Swindon 105.5.

On 31 May 2019, it was merged into Heart West.

==History==
Heart Wiltshire launched on 12 October 1982 under its original name, Wiltshire Radio &quot;(shortened often to WR)&quot;. Broadcasting from &#x27;The Limekiln&#x27; in Wootton Bassett, they capitalised on the fact that BBC Radio 1 had bad reception in North Wiltshire and it was to be seven years before BBC Local Radio launched in the county. The station began a full service commercial radio station on 96.4 and 97.4 MHz FM and 936 and 1161 kHz AM (320 and 258 metres medium wave).

Because there was a lack of BBC Radio for Wiltshire and therefore no competition, Wiltshire Radio found it relatively easy to build a very loyal listenership and only a few months into broadcasting became very profitable. Early programmes started out with a general diet of local news, community information, talk and middle-of-the-road pop music, then eventually became more and more formatted, saving its 4-hour &#x27;needle time&#x27; daily music quota for the evening show to play rock and newer pop. The station&#x27;s Head of Programmes Ralph Bernard went on to become a very significant figure in British commercial radio as founder of Classic FM.

Commercial radio in Britain struggled to make any money. Wiltshire Radio grew as a company, capitalising on its dominance in the local radio market. WR made tentative plans for growth as it set to acquire struggling Bristol station Radio West. Radio West never made a penny since it started and looked set to close when WR made an official approach to merge the two stations, creating a station covering from Weston-super-Mare in the west to Swindon and Hungerford in the east. This merger was approved by the British Government and was completed in 1985.

===Wiltshire Radio into GWR===
In October 1985, Wiltshire Radio relaunched as GWR Radio, a 24-hour radio station (previously Wiltshire Radio closed overnight). However the sound did not change much as GWR Radio was essentially a revamp which coincided with the re-launch of its sister station in Bristol.

===Split services===
GWR Radio began splitting frequencies as required by the British Government – which declared its desire to end simulcasting on both FM and AM. In November 1988, GWR Radio launched Brunel Radio, a golden oldies service (now part of the Gold) network whilst GWR FM launched an opt-out service for West Wiltshire as a more localised service, this was however dropped a few weeks later, citing &quot;poor reception&quot;. A fill-in relay for Marlborough was opened on 14 October 1988 on 96.5 MHz FM.

After the lifting on sanctions restricting the time spent playing music (so-called &#x27;needle time&#x27;) in 1988, GWR FM became more and more music-led, playing Top 40 chart music during the daytime, and specialist music (big band music, rock, rap etc.) was over time eliminated. The local element of the station especially its news coverage had progressively become briefer and reduced in length, then moved onto Brunel Classic Gold, before being dropped altogether.

===Football sponsorship===
The station sponsored Swindon Town Football Club from 1989 until 1991, during the time that they won promotion to the First Division via the playoffs, but remained in the Second Division due to financial irregularities.

===GWR FM – Reboot===
In 1992 a re-launch of the station saw it rebranded as The New GWR FM, with a policy of reduced speech and the dropping of all R&amp;B and hip hop music from the station&#x27;s output. This policy was gradually extended to other GWR Group stations, such as 2-Ten FM in Reading and 2CR FM in Bournemouth. The GWR Group expanded from the late 1980s through to 2005, purchasing other stations throughout southern England, eventually becoming the largest radio company in the UK.

===The Mix Network===
The harmonisation of playlists across the GWR Group led to the creation of The Mix Network in 1997, with GWR Wiltshire at the hub. The radio station&#x27;s (and the group&#x27;s) long held philosophy of heavily researching the average person&#x27;s listening habits and tastes led by Group chairman Ralph Bernard created a tightly formatted sound where popular Top 40 chart hits and ex-Top 40 songs are blended in with older hits. This format, with the strapline &quot;Better Music Mix&quot;, was then subsequently adopted by all stations within the GWR Group, including Essex FM, Trent FM and Beacon Radio creating a mini national network.

The practice for the Mix Network stations were each station played a centrally produced playlist (from GWR FM itself), songs were broadcast on or almost at the same time as neighbouring group stations and each station adopted the &quot;Better Music Mix&quot; tagline, to be said by local disc jockeys in between each song. Fans of the previous guises of some stations bought by the GWR Group, notably Essex FM and Beacon Radio criticised the sudden re-branding of the station&#x27;s taglines and playlists, accusing the new management of reducing local content such as news reports and cancelling local shows in place of programming from the Mix Network, such as Late Night Love and The Request Fest, which originated from the Bristol studios.

===Now Digital===
In 2003, Now Digital, a subsidiary of GWR Group launched local DAB services for Wiltshire and Swindon. In Swindon GWR FM went digital along with sister station Classic Gold, BBC Radio Swindon, Swindon FM and XFM amongst others. In West Wiltshire and Bath GWR FM Bath and BBC Radio Wiltshire aired in place of GWR Swindon and Radio Swindon respectively.

===The One Network===
On 9 May 2005, GWR Group merged with Capital Radio Group to form GCap Media. The programming format of GWR was essentially unchanged by the merger, with The Mix Network being rebranded as The One Network.

===Global Radio takeover===
In 2008, GCap Media was taken over by Global Radio, who subsequently announced that GWR Wiltshire, in common with many other of the other One Network stations, would be rebranded Heart, by 2010. GWR subsequently relaunched as &quot;Heart Wiltshire&quot; on 23 March 2009.

GWR&#x27;s oldies service was originally called Brunel Radio, after the Great Western Railway&#x27;s founding father Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

==Closure==
On 26 February 2019, Global announced Heart Wiltshire would be merged with three sister stations in Bristol and Somerset, Devon and Cornwall and Gloucestershire.

Since 3 June 2019, local output has consisted of a three-hour regional Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

Heart Wiltshire&#x27;s studios in Swindon closed with operations moving to Bristol – the station ceased local programming on 31 May 2019. Local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London.

Heart West began broadcasting regional programming on 3 June 2019.

<text>Puma SE is a German multinational corporation which designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear, apparel, and accessories, headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third largest sportswear manufacturer in the world. The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler (1898–1974). In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf &quot;Adi&quot; Dassler had jointly formed the company (&#x27;Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory&#x27;). The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until they agreed to split in 1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma. Following the split, Rudolf originally registered the newly established company as &quot;Ruda&quot; (derived from Rudolf Dassler, as Adidas was based on Adi Dassler), but later changed the name to &quot;Puma&quot;. Puma&#x27;s earliest logo consisted of a square and beast jumping through a &quot;D&quot;, which was registered, along with the company&#x27;s name, in 1948. Puma&#x27;s shoe and clothing designs feature the Puma logo and the distinctive &quot;Formstrip&quot; which was introduced in 1958.

==History==
===Background===
Christoph Dassler was a worker in a shoe factory, while his wife Pauline ran a small laundry in the Franconian town of Herzogenaurach, from the city of Nuremberg. After leaving school, their son, Rudolf Dassler, joined his father at the shoe factory. When he returned from fighting in World War I, Rudolf was trained as a salesman at a porcelain factory, and later in a leather trading business in Nuremberg.

In July 1924, Rudolf and his younger brother, Adolf, nicknamed &quot;Adi&quot;, founded a shoe factory. They named the new business &quot;Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik&quot; (&quot;Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory&quot;) which was the only business at the time that manufactured sports shoes. The pair started their venture in their mother&#x27;s laundry. At the time, electricity supplies in the town were unreliable, and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment. In 1927, they moved into a separate building.

The brothers drove from Bavaria to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin with a suitcase full of spikes and persuaded United States sprinter Jesse Owens to use them, the first sponsorship for an African American. Owens won four gold medals. Business boomed; the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes annually before World War II.

Both brothers joined the Nazi Party, but Rudolf was a keen Nazi, who applied to join, and was accepted into the Gestapo; they produced boots for the Wehrmacht. A growing rift between the brothers reached a breaking point during a 1943 Allied bomb attack. Adi and his wife climbed into a bomb shelter that Rudolf and his family were already in. &quot;Here are the bloody bastards again,&quot; Adi remarked, apparently referring to the Allied warplanes, but Rudolf, due to his apparent insecurity, was convinced his brother meant him and his family. When Rudolf was later picked up by American soldiers and accused of being a member of the Waffen SS, he was convinced that his brother had turned him in.

=== Split and creation of Puma ===

After increasingly different views of how to run the business, the brothers split the business in 1948. Rudolf moved to the other side of the Aurach River to start his own company. Adolf started his own company using a name he formed using his nickname—Adi—and the first three letters of his last name—Das—to establish Adidas. Rudolf created a new firm that he called &quot;Ruda&quot;, from &quot;Ru&quot; in Rudolf and &quot;Da&quot; in Dassler. A few months later, Rudolf&#x27;s company changed its name to Puma Schuhfabrik Rudolf Dassler.

Puma and Adidas entered a fierce and bitter rivalry after the split. The town of Herzogenaurach was divided on the issue, leading to the nickname &quot;the town of bent necks&quot;—people looked down to see which shoes strangers wore.

In the first football match after World War II in 1948, several members of the West Germany national football team wore Puma boots, including the scorer of West Germany&#x27;s first post-war goal, Herbert Burdenski. Rudolf developed a football boot with screw-in studs, called the &quot;Super Atom&quot; in collaboration with people such as West Germany&#x27;s national coach Sepp Herberger.

=== Olympic presence, World Cup, and the Pelé Pact ===

At the 1952 Summer Olympics, 1500 metres runner Josy Barthel of Luxembourg won Puma&#x27;s first Olympic gold in Helsinki, Finland.

At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Puma paid German sprinter Armin Hary to wear Pumas in the 100-metre sprint final. Hary had previously worn Adidas products and approached Adolf for compensation. However, Adidas declined the request. Despite winning a gold medal in Pumas, Hary chose to wear Adidas during the medals ceremony, surprising the two Dassler brothers. Hary seemingly aimed to benefit financially from both brands, but Adolf was infuriated to the extent of banning the Olympic champion.

During the 1968 Olympics Black Power Salute, Puma-sponsored African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos, after having won gold and bronze in the 200 meters, respectively, took to the podium with their Puma Suede shoes in hand and bowed their heads and raised their black-gloved fists in silent protest during the playing of the national anthem, an act meant to stand up for human rights and to stand up for black Americans.

A few months prior to the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Armin Dassler (Rudolf&#x27;s son) of Puma and his cousin Horst Dassler (Adi&#x27;s son) of Adidas sealed an agreement which was dubbed &quot;The Pelé Pact&quot;. This agreement dictated that Pelé would be out of bounds for both Adidas and Puma, feeling that a bidding war for the most famous athlete in the world would become too expensive, only for Puma to break the pact and sign him.

In addition to paying Pelé a percentage of Puma King boot sales, Puma paid him $120,000 ($2.85 million in 2022) to tie his laces prior to Brazil&#x27;s quarter-final game against Peru to advertise their boots. An idea conceived by Puma&#x27;s representative Hans Henningsen, Pelé stopped the referee from starting the game with a last-second request to tie his shoelaces, and with the camera panning in on Pelé, the Puma King boots were broadcast to a global audience, generating enormous publicity for the brand.

The most notable event in the Dassler brothers feud, the breaking of the &quot;Pelé Pact&quot; outraged Horst, and future peace agreements were called off. The Puma deal for Pelé was praised as a shrewd marketing move, and many business experts credit the rivalry and competition between the two companies for transforming sports apparel into a highly lucrative industry.

During the 1972 Summer Olympics, Puma provided shoes for the Ugandan 400 metres hurdles champion, John Akii-Bua. After Akii-Bua was forced out of Uganda by its military government, Puma employed him in Germany. Eventually, Akii-Bua returned to Uganda.

Puma launched the Puma Clyde in 1973, a basketball shoe based on the Suede. Designed for basketball player Walt &quot;Clyde&quot; Frazier, it gained wide popularity and became significant in the old school hip hop and skate punk subcultures.

=== Going public ===
Puma became a public company in 1986, and thereafter was listed on the Börse München and Frankfurt Stock Exchange; its first profit since the IPO was registered in 1994. In May 1989, Rudolf&#x27;s sons Armin and Gerd Dassler sold their 72 percent stake in Puma to Swiss business &quot;Cosa Liebermann SA&quot;. The company acquired Scandinavian Tretorn Group in 2001, later sold to Authentic Brands Group in 2015. For the fiscal year 2003, the company had revenue of €1.274 billion, and majority shareholder Monarchy/Regency sold its shareholdings to a broad base of institutional investors.

In February 2007, Puma reported that its profits had fallen by 26% to €32.8 million ($43 million; £22 million) during the final three months of 2006. Most of the decline in profits was due to higher costs linked to its expansion; sales rose by more than a third to €480.6 million. In early April, Puma&#x27;s shares rose €29.25 per share, or about 10.2%, to €315.24 per share. On 10 April, the French conglomerate PPR (which became Kering in 2013) announced that it had bought a 27% stake in Puma, clearing the way for a full takeover. The deal valued Puma at €5.3 billion. PPR said that it would launch a friendly takeover of Puma, worth €330 a share, once the acquisition of the smaller stake was completed. The board of Puma welcomed the move, saying it was fair and in the firm&#x27;s best interests. As of July 2007, PPR owned over 60% of Puma stock.

In 2008, Melody Harris-Jensbach was appointed deputy chief executive officer; designer and artist Hussein Chalayan became creative director, and Puma acquired a majority stake in Chalayan&#x27;s fashion business.

=== 2010 onward ===

In 2010, Puma acquired Cobra Golf, and took over bodywear and socks company Dobotex the following year. In July 2011, the company completed a conversion from an (German public limited company) to a , the European Union-wide equivalent, changing its name from &quot;Puma AG Rudolf Dassler Sport&quot; to &quot;Puma SE&quot;. At the same time, replaced the long-serving Jochen Zeitz as the firm&#x27;s chief executive officer (CEO), with Zeitz becoming chairman. The company has been led by former football professional Bjørn Gulden since 1 July 2013. Arne Freundt was appointed CEO in November 2022.

Since 2018, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for a boycott of Puma over its sponsorship of the Israel Football Association and demanded that the company &quot;end complicity with the Israeli colonial and apartheid regime.&quot; The BDS campaign also stated that Puma contracted with an Israeli distributor operating in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Puma will end its sponsorship of the Israel national football team in 2024.

== Finances ==

Puma has been a public company since 1986, listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. French luxury group Kering (formerly known as PPR) holds 9.8%, Kering&#x27;s largest shareholder Groupe Artemis owns 29% of the share capital.

Puma ranks as one of the top shoe brands with Adidas and Nike, and employs more than 18,000 people worldwide. The company has corporate offices around the world, including four defined as &quot;central hubs&quot;: Assembly Row, Somerville, Massachusetts; Hong Kong; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; and global headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.

Puma utilizes social media marketing activities (SMMA) to leverage customer purchases in Indonesia and boost brand awareness, brand image, and brand equity. Purchase intention was significantly influenced by brand awareness caused by SMMA. When consumers are more aware of Puma and have a positive image of the brand, they are more likely to purchase its products. Puma&#x27;s social media marketing strategies have a direct effect on purchase intentions, which is a leading indicator of actual sales, especially in the middle class.

Through supply chain finance, Puma helps suppliers avoid cash flow issues by offering early payment on invoices, reducing costs and risk. The company uses the Infor Nexus digital platform to streamline the process, connecting buyers, suppliers, and banks. This platform enables fast, electronic payment and provides transparency, reducing manual work for suppliers and offering quicker access to financing, with payments made within five days of delivery.

==Labour practices and factory conditions==
In 2000, Puma began auditing all of its suppliers on a yearly basis, and makes the results available in its sustainability reports. Since 2005, it has publicly provided a list of its suppliers.

In August 2004, a joint report from the National Labor Committee and China Labor Watch stated that workers at some of Puma&#x27;s Chinese factories were enduring sweatshop conditions, working up to 16.5 hours per day for about US$0.31 an hour. Puma said it would investigate the claims.

In February 2012, a woman who worked for one of Puma&#x27;s suppliers in Cambodia was shot during a protest over factory working conditions. Puma acknowledged the poor working conditions and said it would work to improve the situation.

According to a joint report from Labour Behind the Label and Community Legal Education Centre, 30 workers fainted in November 2012 while producing clothing for Puma in China. The faintings were caused by excessive heat and alleged forced overtime. In 2014, almost 120 workers fainted in two Cambodian clothing factories where sportswear was being produced for Puma and Adidas, due to temperatures above . In March 2017, 150 workers assembling Puma products in Cambodia fainted due to thick smoke.

Puma has obtained the Ethical Clothing Australia accreditation for its Australian-made products. This labour-friendly accreditation applies to only a small percentage of Puma&#x27;s total production.

In 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including Puma, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang. In 2022, researchers from Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences identified cotton from Xinjiang in Puma shirts.

Research funded by the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats of the European Parliament and the Freedom Fund, conducted by Uyghur Rights Monitor, Sheffield Hallam University, and the Uyghur Center for Democracy and Human Rights, showed in December 2023 that Puma is supplied by Gain Lucky, an international intermediary of Anhui Huamao, a textile manufacturer that has a history of using forced labour by Uyghurs.

==Environmental practices==
In May 2011, English newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Puma was the &quot;world&#x27;s first major company to put a value on its environmental impact&quot; and that Puma &quot;has made a commitment that within four years, half its international collections will be manufactured according to its internal sustainability standard, by using more sustainable materials such as recycled polyester, as well as ensuring its suppliers develop more sustainable materials and products.&quot;

Puma is also known for boosting positive environmental practices in its supply chain through financial incentives. The supply chain finance scheme implemented links the sustainability performance of key suppliers to the costs at which they can access finance. Puma managed to limit the carbon emissions that emanate from its supply chain through employing more eco-friendly and less carbon intensive materials. The system won the company an &quot;Innovation Award&quot; in Supply Chain Finance in 2016.

Puma managed to reduce its own carbon emissions worldwide by 88% between 2017 and 2021. This was mainly facilitated through buying renewable energy or renewable energy certificates.

In 2023, Puma announced that it would stop using kangaroo leather in its products, including its redesigned KING football boot, which features uppers containing at least 20% recycled material. Also, in April 2023, Puma announced its new sustainable initiative, Voices of a Re:Generation, which aims to develop the brand&#x27;s &#x27;sustainable journey&#x27; through involving the &#x27;recommendations&#x27; and &#x27;perspectives&#x27; of the next generation. Voices of Re:Generation is made up of young activists in Europe and the U.S. ranging from 12 to 30 years old. They take action through protests, rallies, petitions, and partnerships with major companies, like Puma. The initiative features figures like Alice Aedy and Andrew Burgess, who aim to make sustainability more transparent and resonate with Gen Z. It also seeks to combat &quot;greenwashing&quot; through actionable steps and inclusivity. As teen spending power grows, Puma’s focus on environmental priorities aligns with this demographic&#x27;s values, complementing other Gen Z-focused efforts like metaverse projects.

Puma&#x27;s focus on the environment and partnerships with these sustainability initiatives has paid off. The company&#x27;s values reflect the growing consumer demand for environmentally conscious brands. This has led to an increase in Puma&#x27;s product demand, therefore boosting their finances.

In January 2024, the fashion Energy Report of Utility Bidder, a utility switching service, categorized Puma as the &#x27;most sustainable brand&#x27; with a high sustainability rating, a high level of transparency, and a low amount of CO2 produced when someone visits their website.

<text>GWR FM was a network of three radio stations in the south west of England broadcasting to Bristol, Bath, Wiltshire and surrounding areas. All three stations were rebranded and joined the Heart Network on 23 March 2009. 

The stations in the network were:
*GWR FM Bristol, which was launched in 1981 as Radio West. It relaunched as GWR in 1985
*GWR FM Bath, first broadcast as GWR Radio Bath in 1987, becoming the third station in the network and sharing some programming with the Bristol station
*GWR FM Wiltshire, which launched in 1982 as Wiltshire Radio. In 1985, Wiltshire Radio relaunched as GWR, to coincide with the re-launch of the Bristol station

== History ==

The GWR Radio brand started life in 1985 when Swindon-based Wiltshire Radio joined with Bristol&#x27;s Radio West.

==The Mix Network==

In 1992 a re-launch of the station saw The New GWR-FM become the hub of what was The Mix Network, a network of radio stations owned by the GWR Group (later GCap Media ) covering southern England and Wales. The radio station created a tightly formatted sound where popular Top 40 chart hits were blended with older hits. This led to its &quot;Better Music Mix&quot; format which was then utilised on other radio stations within the GWR Group, including Essex FM, Trent FM and Beacon Radio, creating a mini national network.

Each station within the Mix Network played a centrally produced playlist. Songs were broadcast almost at the same time as neighbouring group stations and each station adopted the &quot;Better Music Mix&quot; tagline which was announced by local presenters in between the music. Following the introduction of the Mix Network some programming, such as Late Night Love and The Request Fest, was syndicated across the whole network from the GWR Bristol studios.

<text>The 1959 Escuminac disaster, also known as the Escuminac hurricane, was considered the worst fishing-related disaster in New Brunswick in 100 years. It occurred due to the extratropical remnants of an Atlantic hurricane. The storm was the third tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season, and developed from a tropical wave in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 18. It headed rapidly northeastward and struck Florida later that day. Shortly after entering the Atlantic Ocean, it strengthened into a tropical storm later on June 18. By the following day, it had strengthened into a hurricane. However, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later. The remnants struck Atlantic Canada, once in Nova Scotia and again in Newfoundland before dissipating on June 21.

In its early stages, the storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7 million (1959 USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45 boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22 fishing boats capsized with their crews, causing 35 fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses sustained damage, costing $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.

==Early history==

On June 15, a tropical wave with associated instability was observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June 16, and the next day developed a weak circulation at the same time that Tropical Storm Beulah was on the other side of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast, becoming a tropical depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC. Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral.

As the depression struck western Florida, it produced above-normal tides, which damaged docks and caused beach erosion. Wind gusts near Sarasota reached about . After previously wet conditions, the system dropped heavy rainfall across the state, unofficially reaching in some areas and causing flooding. Along the Indian River, flooding damaged citrus crops, and statewide some roads were damaged. When the storm was first forming in the Gulf of Mexico, it spawned an F3 tornado in Miami that lasted for over 20 minutes. The National Climatic Data Center considered it the worst tornado in the city since 1925, and the overall path was about . A total of 77 people were injured due to the tornado, mostly due to cuts from broken glass, and damage from it was estimated at $1.5 million. Another tornado was reported north of West Palm Beach, although it affected a sparsely populated area; total damage statewide totaled $1,656,000.

==Storm approach to Canada==
Late on July 2, it is estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and that day the Miami Hurricane Center issued its last advisory, warning ships of the potential for future strengthening. The storm moved rapidly to the northeast, passing halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina early on June 19. At 0250 UTC that day, a ship reported a falling barometric pressure of with west-southwesterly winds of . Although it was associated with a diffused frontal zone, the storm maintained a warm core and initially remained largely tropical. At 1200 UTC on June 19, it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane about halfway between Bermuda and Nova Scotia, with a pressure of . Six hours later, it became extratropical, although the former hurricane intensified further to peak winds of . On June 20, the storm slowed and turned sharply to the northwest. It weakened slightly before moving ashore near Canso, Nova Scotia. Crossing the island, it struck Prince Edward Island before turning sharply to the east and crossing Nova Scotia again. Late on June 20, it re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to the east-northeast. The extratropical storm moved over southeastern Newfoundland and dissipated on June 21.

Before the storm reached Atlantic Canada, the meteorological branch of the Department of Transport provided notices for the advancing storm. On the day of the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

==Impact and aftermath==

Along the coast of New Brunswick, the storm produced waves that destroyed several boats, including 22 over open waters between Point Escuminac and Richibucto. Two bodies washed ashore in the latter, and eleven bodies were eventually discovered. About one-third of the salmon boats in Miramichi were destroyed. Across New Brunswick, the storm disrupted communications near the coast. Along the coasts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, high waves destroyed cottages and forced some families to evacuate. The former hurricane produced strong winds in the region, peaking at , and its passage was accompanied by moderate rainfall, peaking at in Nova Scotia. There, many lobster cages were destroyed, and boats were removed from their moorings. In Prince Edward Island, up to 50% of the lobster traps were destroyed or missing, including 5,000 destroyed traps near Souris. As with New Brunswick, several boats were destroyed or washed ashore, and damage in the province was estimated at $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). A total of 35 people were killed between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, mostly fishermen. As a result, the Escuminac disaster, as it came to be known, became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick. The minister of fisheries considered the event to be &quot;the worst disaster to hit a Canadian fishing fleet in about 100 years&quot;.

In the days after the storm, the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police operated search and rescue missions, while families waited on the beach. The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims. Due to storm fatalities, 24 adults became widows, and 83 children lost their fathers. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen&#x27;s Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter who was on a tour of the country at the time.

In memory of the storm victims, artist Claude Roussel created a wood sculpture entitled &quot;Les Pêcheurs – The Fishermen&quot;, which won first prize at New Brunswick Museum in 1962. Later, residents near Escuminac raised money to turn the work into a stone monument, which was dedicated on June 19, 1969. It was nearly in height, weighed about , and depicted a group of fishermen working together, with the names of the deceased on a bronze plaque. In 2001, the government of New Brunswick declared the Escuminac Disaster Monument as a provincial historical site.

<doc id="941907" wikidata="Q1505965" url="?curid=941907" title="Wheeler Peak (New Mexico)">
<text>Wheeler Peak is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of New Mexico. It is located northeast of Taos and south of Red River in the northern part of the state, and just southeast of the ski slopes of Taos Ski Valley. It lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. The peak&#x27;s elevation is .

Formerly named Taos Peak, after the nearby town of Taos, New Mexico, it was renamed Wheeler Peak in 1950. A plaque at the summit states that the mountain was:

Named in honor of Major George Montague Wheeler (1832–1909) who for ten years led a party of surveyors and naturalists collecting geologic, biologic, planimetric and topographic data in New Mexico and six other southwestern states.

== Nearby peaks and features ==
Just north of Wheeler Peak is Mount Walter. At it is the second highest named summit in New Mexico, but it is not usually considered an independent peak as it has only about of topographic prominence. It is sometimes mistaken for Wheeler Peak, since it is along the standard route to Wheeler. Lake Fork Peak at lies just across Williams Lake and to the west of Wheeler Mountain.

Taos Ski Valley lies to the northwest of Wheeler Peak, while both the town of Taos and Taos Pueblo are about to the southwest.

Wheeler Peak is the focus of the Wheeler Peak Wilderness area in the Carson National Forest. Much of the mountain area just south of the peak is on Taos Pueblo land. Some was returned to the pueblo from the Carson National Forest in 1970
and another in 1996.

==Climate==
== Climbing ==
The standard route on Wheeler Peak is along the north ridge. The route starts at the parking lot for Taos Ski Valley, and proceeds east along an old road to a broad saddle at Bull-of-the-Woods Meadow. It then turns south and winds its way among minor peaks and small valleys to gain Wheeler Peak from the north, going over the summit of Mount Walter along the way. This is a practical route, even in winter, due to low (but nonzero) avalanche exposure.

An alternate route is to hike south from Taos Ski Valley to Williams Lake, then take a newly constructed switchback trail to the top. This trail was completed in 2011 by a Forest Service trail crew from the Gallatin National Forest, 8 people working 12 hours per day, building 4 miles of new trail with hand tools to the top in 14 days.

Another alternate route is to begin from the nearby ski resort of Red River. From the town of Red River drive 6.4 miles south on NM 578, then 1.3 miles on FR 58 to the trailhead parking area. From the parking area Wheeler peak is about 7 miles on Forest Trail 91. This route passes two alpine lakes, Lost Lake and Horseshoe Lake.

Wheeler Peak has a summit register as do many major western peaks.

<doc id="941909" wikidata="Q1755207" url="?curid=941909" title="Receptive field">
<text>The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a sensory neuronal response in specific organisms.

Complexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive field for touch perception. Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with or without affecting the rate of action potentials.

A sensory space can be dependent of an animal&#x27;s location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal&#x27;s location, as in the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal&#x27;s body. For example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal&#x27;s body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.

The term &quot;receptive field&quot; was first used by Sherrington in 1906 to describe the area of skin from which a scratch reflex could be elicited in a dog. In 1938, Hartline started to apply the term to single neurons, this time from the frog retina.

This concept of receptive fields can be extended further up the nervous system. If many sensory receptors all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the receptive field of that cell. For example, the receptive field of a ganglion cell in the retina of the eye is composed of input from all of the photoreceptors which synapse with it, and a group of ganglion cells in turn forms the receptive field for a cell in the brain. This process is called convergence.

Receptive fields have been used in modern artificial deep neural networks that work with local operations.

==Auditory system==
The auditory system processes the temporal and spectral (i.e. frequency) characteristics of sound waves, so the receptive fields of neurons in the auditory system are modeled as spectro-temporal patterns that cause the firing rate of the neuron to modulate with the auditory stimulus. Auditory receptive fields are often modeled as spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs), which are the specific pattern in the auditory domain that causes modulation of the firing rate of a neuron. Linear STRFs are created by first calculating a spectrogram of the acoustic stimulus, which determines how the spectral density of the acoustic stimulus changes over time, often using the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Firing rate is modeled over time for the neuron, possibly using a peristimulus time histogram if combining over multiple repetitions of the acoustic stimulus. Then, linear regression is used to predict the firing rate of that neuron as a weighted sum of the spectrogram. The weights learned by the linear model are the STRF, and represent the specific acoustic pattern that causes modulation in the firing rate of the neuron. STRFs can also be understood as the transfer function that maps an acoustic stimulus input to a firing rate response output. A theoretical explanation of the computational function of early auditory receptive fields is given in.

==Somatosensory system==
In the somatosensory system, receptive fields are regions of the skin or of internal organs. Some types of mechanoreceptors have large receptive fields, while others have smaller ones.

Large receptive fields allow the cell to detect changes over a wider area, but lead to a less precise perception. Thus, the fingers, which require the ability to detect fine detail, have many, densely packed (up to 500 per cubic cm) mechanoreceptors with small receptive fields (around 10 square mm), while the back and legs, for example, have fewer receptors with large receptive fields. Receptors with large receptive fields usually have a &quot;hot spot&quot;, an area within the receptive field (usually in the center, directly over the receptor) where stimulation produces the most intense response.

Tactile-sense-related cortical neurons have receptive fields on the skin that can be modified by experience or by injury to sensory nerves resulting in changes in the field&#x27;s size and position. In general these neurons have relatively large receptive fields (much larger than those of dorsal root ganglion cells). However, the neurons are able to discriminate fine detail due to patterns of excitation and inhibition relative to the field which leads to spatial resolution.

==Visual system==

In the visual system, receptive fields are volumes in visual space. They are smallest in the fovea where they can be a few minutes of arc like a dot on this page, to the whole page. For example, the receptive field of a single photoreceptor is a cone-shaped volume comprising all the visual directions in which light will alter the firing of that cell. Its apex is located in the center of the lens and its base essentially at infinity in visual space. Traditionally, visual receptive fields were portrayed in two dimensions (e.g., as circles, squares, or rectangles), but these are simply slices, cut along the screen on which the researcher presented the stimulus, of the volume of space to which a particular cell will respond. In the case of binocular neurons in the visual cortex, receptive fields do not extend to optical infinity. Instead, they are restricted to a certain interval of distance from the animal, or from where the eyes are fixating (see Panum&#x27;s area).

The receptive field is often identified as the region of the retina where the action of light alters the firing of the neuron. In retinal ganglion cells (see below), this area of the retina would encompass all the photoreceptors, all the rods and cones from one eye that are connected to this particular ganglion cell via bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells. In binocular neurons in the visual cortex, it is necessary to specify the corresponding area in both retinas (one in each eye). Although these can be mapped separately in each retina by shutting one or the other eye, the full influence on the neuron&#x27;s firing is revealed only when both eyes are open.

Hubel and Wiesel advanced the theory that &quot;receptive fields of cells at one level of the visual system are formed from input by cells at a lower level of the visual system.&quot; In this way, small, &quot;simple receptive fields could be combined to form large, complex receptive fields.&quot; Later theorists elaborated this simple, hierarchical arrangement by allowing cells at one level of the visual system to be influenced by feedback from higher levels.

Receptive fields have been mapped for all levels of the visual system from photoreceptors, to retinal ganglion cells, to lateral geniculate nucleus cells, to visual cortex cells, to extrastriate cortical cells. However, because the activities of neurons at any one location are contingent on the activities of neurons across the whole system, i.e. are contingent on changes in the whole field, it is unclear whether a local description of a particular &quot;receptive field&quot; can be considered a general description, robust to changes in the field as a whole. Studies based on perception do not give the full picture of the understanding of visual phenomena, so the electrophysiological tools must be used, as the retina, after all, is an outgrowth of the brain.

In retinal ganglion and V1 cells, the receptive field consists of the center &quot;and&quot; surround region.

===Retinal ganglion cells===

Each ganglion cell or optic nerve fiber bears a receptive field, increasing with intensifying light. In the largest field, the light has to be more intense at the periphery of the field than at the center, showing that some synaptic pathways are more preferred than others.

The organization of ganglion cells&#x27; receptive fields, composed of inputs from many rods and cones, provides a way of detecting contrast, and is used for detecting objects&#x27; edges. Each receptive field is arranged into a central disk, the &quot;center&quot;, and a concentric ring, the &quot;surround&quot;, each region responding oppositely to light. For example, light in the centre might increase the firing of a particular ganglion cell, whereas light in the surround would decrease the firing of that cell.

Stimulation of the center of an on-center cell&#x27;s receptive field produces &quot;depolarization&quot; and an increase in the firing of the ganglion cell, stimulation of the surround produces a &quot;hyperpolarization&quot; and a decrease in the firing of the cell, and stimulation of both the center and surround produces only a mild response (due to mutual inhibition of center and surround). An off-center cell is stimulated by activation of the surround and inhibited by stimulation of the center (see figure).

Photoreceptors that are part of the receptive fields of more than one ganglion cell are able to excite or inhibit postsynaptic neurons because they release the neurotransmitter glutamate at their synapses, which can act to depolarize or to hyperpolarize a cell, depending on whether there is a metabotropic or ionotropic receptor on that cell.

The &quot;center-surround receptive field organization&quot; allows ganglion cells to transmit information not merely about whether photoreceptor cells are exposed to light, but also about the differences in firing rates of cells in the center and surround. This allows them to transmit information about contrast. The size of the receptive field governs the spatial frequency of the information: small receptive fields are stimulated by high spatial frequencies, fine detail; large receptive fields are stimulated by low spatial frequencies, coarse detail. Retinal ganglion cell receptive fields convey information about discontinuities in the distribution of light falling on the retina; these often specify the edges of objects. In dark adaptation, the peripheral opposite activity zone becomes inactive, but, since it is a diminishing of inhibition between center and periphery, the active field can actually increase, allowing more area for summation.

===Lateral geniculate nucleus===
Further along in the visual system, groups of ganglion cells form the receptive fields of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Receptive fields are similar to those of ganglion cells, with an antagonistic center-surround system and cells that are either on- or off center.

===Visual cortex===
Receptive fields of cells in the visual cortex are larger and have more-complex stimulus requirements than retinal ganglion cells or lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Hubel and Wiesel (e.g., Hubel, 1963; Hubel-Wiesel 1959) classified receptive fields of cells in the visual cortex into simple cells, complex cells, and hypercomplex cells. Simple cell receptive fields are elongated, for example with an excitatory central oval, and an inhibitory surrounding region, or approximately rectangular, with one long side being excitatory and the other being inhibitory. Images for these receptive fields need to have a particular orientation in order to excite the cell. For complex-cell receptive fields, a correctly oriented bar of light might need to move in a particular direction in order to excite the cell. For hypercomplex receptive fields, the bar might also need to be of a particular length.

===Extrastriate visual areas===
In extrastriate visual areas, cells can have very large receptive fields requiring very complex images to excite the cell. For example, in the inferotemporal cortex, receptive fields cross the midline of visual space and require images such as radial gratings or hands. It is also believed that in the fusiform face area, images of faces excite the cortex more than other images. This property was one of the earliest major results obtained through fMRI (Kanwisher, McDermott and Chun, 1997); the finding was confirmed later at the neuronal level (Tsao, Freiwald, Tootell and Livingstone, 2006). In a similar vein, people have looked for other category-specific areas and found evidence for regions representing views of places (parahippocampal place area) and the body (Extrastriate body area). However, more recent research has suggested that the fusiform face area is specialised not just for faces, but also for any discrete, within-category discrimination.

===Computational theory of visual receptive fields===

A theoretical explanation of the computational function of visual receptive fields is given in. It is described how idealised models of receptive fields similar to the biological receptive fields found in the retina, the LGN and the primary visual cortex can be derived from structural properties of the environment in combination with internal consistency to guarantee consistent representation of image structures over multiple spatial and temporal scales. It is also described how the receptive fields in the primary visual cortex, which are tuned to different sizes, orientations and directions in the image domain, enable the visual system to handle the influence of natural image transformations and to compute invariant image representations at higher levels in the visual hierarchy.

An in-depth theoretical analysis of how the orientation selectivity of simple cells and complex cells in the primary visual cortex relate to inherent properties of visual receptive fields is given in.

==In the context of neural networks==
The term receptive field is also used in the context of artificial neural networks, most often in relation to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). So, in a neural network context, the receptive field is defined as the size of the region in the input that produces the feature. Basically, it is a measure of association of an output feature (of any layer) to the input region (patch). It is important to note that the idea of receptive fields applies to local operations (i.e. convolution, pooling). As an example, in motion-based tasks, like video prediction and optical flow estimation, large motions need to be captured (displacements of pixels in a 2D grid), so an adequate receptive field is required. Specifically, the receptive field should be sufficient if it is larger than the largest flow magnitude of the dataset. There are a lot of ways that one can increase the receptive field on a CNN.

When used in this sense, the term adopts a meaning reminiscent of receptive fields in actual biological nervous systems. CNNs have a distinct architecture, designed to mimic the way in which real animal brains are understood to function; instead of having every neuron in each layer connect to all neurons in the next layer (Multilayer perceptron), the neurons are arranged in a 3-dimensional structure in such a way as to take into account the spatial relationships between different neurons with respect to the original data. Since CNNs are used primarily in the field of computer vision, the data that the neurons represent is typically an image; each input neuron represents one pixel from the original image. The first layer of neurons is composed of all the input neurons; neurons in the next layer will receive connections from some of the input neurons (pixels), but not all, as would be the case in a MLP and in other traditional neural networks. Hence, instead of having each neuron receive connections from all neurons in the previous layer, CNNs use a receptive field-like layout in which each neuron receives connections only from a subset of neurons in the previous (lower) layer. The receptive field of a neuron in one of the lower layers encompasses only a small area of the image, while the receptive field of a neuron in subsequent (higher) layers involves a combination of receptive fields from several (but not all) neurons in the layer before (i. e. a neuron in a higher layer &quot;looks&quot; at a larger portion of the image than does a neuron in a lower layer). In this way, each successive layer is capable of learning increasingly abstract features of the original image. The use of receptive fields in this fashion is thought to give CNNs an advantage in recognizing visual patterns when compared to other types of neural networks.

<text>Number 39 Squadron is an inactive squadron of the Royal Air Force. It last operated the General Atomics MQ-9A Reaper from Creech AFB, Nevada, between January 2007 and July 2022. It had previously operated the English Electric Canberra PR.7, PR.9 and T.4 from RAF Marham, Norfolk, as No. 39 (1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit) Squadron between July 1992 and July 2006.

==History==

===First World War===
No. 39 Squadron was founded at Hounslow Heath Aerodrome on 15 April 1916 with Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s and B.E.12s in an attempt to defend against German Zeppelin raids on London. Having moved to RFC Suttons Farm, 39 Squadron achieved its first success on the night of 2/3 September 1916, when Lieutenant William Leefe Robinson shot down the German Airship Schütte-Lanz &quot;SL11&quot;, being awarded the Victoria Cross for this action. On 23 September 1916, the German Navy launched another Zeppelin raid against London. Responding to this raid, 2nd Lieutenant Frederick Sowrey of No. 39 Squadron shot down Zeppelin &quot;L.32&quot;, while Alfred Brandon in another No. 39 Squadron B.E.2 engaged Zeppelin &quot;L.33&quot;, already damaged by anti-aircraft fire, with L.33 force landing at Little Wigborough, Essex, and being destroyed by its crew. On the night of 1/2 October 1916, 2nd Lieutenant W. L. Tempest of 39 Squadron, flying a B.E.2c, spotted Zeppelin &quot;L.31&quot; illuminated by searchlights over southwest London and shot it down with the loss of the entire airship crew.

The squadron continued in the defence of London, supplementing its B.E.2s and B.E.12s with three Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s to help deal with daylight attacks by German Gotha bombers, with at least one Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 also operated by the unit. The squadron re-equipped with Bristol F.2 Fighters in September 1917, but had no more success against German raiders until the night of 19/20 May 1918, when a No. 39 Squadron Bristol Fighter shot down a Gotha bomber. In October 1918, it was re-equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b aircraft and sent to France for night bombing, but was disbanded five days after the Armistice.

===Between the wars===
It was reformed on 1 July 1919, when No. 37 Squadron based at Biggin Hill was renumbered. The squadron was reduced to a cadre in December 1919, but did not disband, and in April 1921 it was decided to return the Squadron to operations. By May that year, the squadron was fully manned and received a number of Avro 504 to train aircrew in preparation for operating more warlike aircraft. These arrived in February 1923 when the squadron, now based at RAF Spitalgate in Lincolnshire received 18 Airco DH.9As. As well as training for its role as a day bomber, the squadron also was chosen to perform a formation flying display at the RAF Air Pageant at Hendon in 1923, repeating its appearance in 1926 and 1927, when it flew joint formation flying and bombing displays with 207 Squadron. In January 1928, the squadron moved from Spitalgate to RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk, where it began to prepare to a prospective move to British India.
In December 1929 it left the United Kingdom, leaving behind its DH.9As to equip No. 101 Squadron. It arrived at Risalpur, North-West Frontier Province India (now part of Pakistan) at the end of January 1929, receiving its complement of twelve Westland Wapitis (which had been shipped out separately) in March that year. It was used for Air Policing in the North West Frontier, carrying out bombing missions against rebelling tribesmen and their villages, and support for the army. In December 1931, it was re-equipped with Hawker Harts, operations continuing as before, also being used as part of the relief effort following the 1935 Quetta earthquake, flying supplies to devastated Quetta and carrying out medical evacuations. Major military operations included support of the Second Mohmand Campaign of 1935 against hostile tribesmen in Mohmand Territory, and operations against supporters of the Faqir of Ipi in 1938.

===Second World War===

In 1939, the squadron re-equipped with more modern Bristol Blenheim I twin-engined monoplane bombers. As the threat of war increased, it was decided to strengthen British defences in the Far East by moving No. 39 Squadron to Singapore, with the squadron setting off with nine Blenheims on 6 August. The ferry trip was a disaster, with six aircraft wrecked, and three men killed, including Wing Commander Burton Ankers, commander of the 2nd Indian Wing Station at Risalpur, whose Blenheim caught fire and crashed after being struck by lightning. In April 1940, the squadron was ordered back to India, arriving at Lahore on 25 April, and then to strengthen defences in the Middle East, being ordered to reinforce Aden, setting out on 5 May, with the air component reaching Aden on 13 May and the groundcrew arriving by ship on 10 June 1940.

On that day, Italy declared war on Great Britain and France, and No. 39 Squadron was quickly committed to action against Italian East Africa, carrying out its first combat mission of the war on 12 June when a force of Blenheims attacked Dire Dawa airfield in Ethiopia, causing little damage. The squadron continued operations against Italian forces until 24 November, when it was ordered to transfer to Egypt to support the planned offensive in the Western Desert (Operation Compass), with the first aircraft leaving Aden for RAF Helwan on 29 November.

A detachment of three Blenheims operated with No. 45 Squadron over the Western Desert from 10 December, flying harassment raids against Italian-held airfields, while the remainder of the Squadron remained at Helwan while it recovered from the operations in East Africa, and started to replace its Blenheim Is with Blenheim IVs. In January, however, the squadron was ordered to recall the three aircraft detachment and hand over the squadron&#x27;s Blenheims to 11 Squadron, which was to deploy to Greece. To replace its Blenheim IVs, 39 Squadron received Martin Maryland bombers, originally built for the French Air Force, becoming the first RAF squadron to operate the Maryland. Owing to the long-range of the Maryland, No. 39 Squadron used it mainly for reconnaissance. The squadron was heavily deployed during the Battle of Crete, claiming at least two Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft shot down in the course of its operations during the battle.
In August–September 1941, the squadron partly converted to the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber for anti-shipping operations, although it retained a flight of Marylands until January 1942. At first the Squadron&#x27;s Beauforts were armed with bombs but from January 1942 it added torpedo attack to its roles. On 23 January 1942, in the first torpedo attack by the squadron, three Beauforts set out an airfield near Benghazi against an Italian convoy carrying supplies to Tripoli, Libya. They hit the troopship and ex-liner with two torpedoes. A third torpedo hit later that day by a Fairey Albacore of 826 Naval Air Squadron caused &quot;Victoria&quot; to sink. In late 1941 the unit was split up. One flight moved to Luqa, Malta in December 1941: six months later this flight was combined with others from Nos. 86 and 217 Squadrons to eventually form a new No. 39 Squadron. In 1943 the unit re-equipped with Bristol Beaufighter aircraft in the ground attack role and moved back to Egypt then on to Italy. During the Greek Civil War, it sent rocket-armed aircraft to participate in RAF operations. In December 1944, it re-equipped with Martin Marauders, flying medium bombing missions in support of Tito&#x27;s Partisans. It re-equipped with de Havilland Mosquitos in 1946, disbanding later in the year.

===Cold War===
It reformed as a fighter squadron equipped with the Hawker Tempest at Nairobi on 1 April 1948, disbanding on 28 February 1949, but reforming the next day at RAF Fayid in Egypt, flying de Havilland Mosquito NF Mk 36 night fighters. The squadron moved to nearby RAF Kabrit on 21 February 1951. As 1951 continued, tensions between the British forces in the Suez Canal Zone and the Egyptians, who wanted Britain to pull out of Egypt, and following anti-British riots in Cairo in January 1952, the squadron was put on standby to support plans for a British attack on Cairo if the situation further deteriorated, until the Egyptian army intervened and stopped the rioting, easing tensions a little. It re-equipped with Gloster Meteor NF.13 night fighters in March 1953, but following the Egyptian revolution of 1952, the situation for the British gradually became untenable, and in October 1954, the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement was signed, in which Britain agreed that its forces would leave Egypt by June 1956. As part of this agreement, No. 39 Squadron moved to RAF Luqa in Malta on 10 January 1955.

The squadron moved to RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus in August 1956 as Britain and France prepared a military response to the Egyptian Nationalisation of the Suez Canal. On 31 October, the British and French launched Operation Musketeer, a series of heavy air attacks against Egyptian targets followed by landings on 6 November. No. 39 Squadron&#x27;s role was to protect the vital airfields on Cyprus from any potential Egyptian retaliation. Pressure from the UN forced a ceasefire in Egypt and a withdrawal of the Anglo-French forces by the end of December, but the squadron remained in Cyprus after the British forces dispersed, flying patrols to deter aircraft that were suspected of dropping supplies to EOKA forces fighting against the British rule of Cyprus. The main body of the squadron returned to Malta in March 1957, but a detachment was maintained on Cyprus. Tensions in Lebanon (which eventually culminated in the Lebanon Crisis of July–October 1958) caused the whole squadron to move to Cyprus in May 1958, but it soon returned to Malta and disbanded on 30 June 1958.

No. 39 Squadron reformed the next day at RAF Luqa by renumbering No. 69 Squadron, flying reconnaissance English Electric Canberra PR.3s in the high altitude reconnaissance role and assigned to the NATO Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force. It moved to RAF Wyton in September 1970, disbanding on 1 June 1982.

===No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit===

The squadron was reformed on 1 July 1992 when No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (1 PRU) at RAF Wyton, equipped with Canberra PR.9 and T.4 aircraft was re-numbered No. 39 (1 PRU) Squadron. The unit moved to RAF Marham in December 1993, where it also received Canberra PR.7s. In December 1996, the squadron deployed to Uganda in order to search for Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire after the Rwandan genocide. Between 1996 and 2001, No. 39 (1 PRU) Squadron deployed six times to Kenya and Zimbabwe to carry out photo-mapping. Between October 2001 and January 2002, the squadron deployed two Canberra PR.9s to Seeb International Airport, Oman, from where it undertook sorties over Afghanistan as part of Op VERITAS and Op ORACLE. In 2003, the unit deployed to Azraq Air Base, Jordan, in support of Operation Telic. On 8 September 2003, Canberra PR.9 &quot;XH168&quot; was written off after bursting its main landing gear tyres upon touching down at RAF Marham, with the crew suffering no injuries. In November 2003, two Canberra PR.9s departed to RAF Mount Pleasant, Falkland Islands, to carry out survey work.

On 2 September 2004, Canberra T.4 &quot;WJ866&quot; crashed at RAF Marham while carrying out a touch and go at night time, killing both pilots and injuring the navigator, this was the last operational Canberra loss for the RAF. No. 39 (1 PRU) Squadron carried out the last RAF flight of a Canberra T.4 (&quot;WJ874&quot;) on 1 September 2005, marking an end to 45 years of service, flying over locations associated with the type such as RAF Wyton, former RAF Bassingbourn and the former English Electric factory at Samlesbury Aerodrome.

In January 2006, No. 39 (1 PRU) Squadron deployed for the last time to Afghanistan in support of Operation Herrick, with the two Canberra PR.9s arriving back to RAF Marham on 23 June 2006 – marking an end to operational service for the Canberra. The squadron disbanded on 28 July 2006 at RAF Marham, with the occasion marked by a flypast and parade. The last three Canberras (&quot;XH131&quot;, &quot;XH134&quot; and &quot;XH135&quot;) undertook their last flight from Marham to Kemble Airfield, Gloucestershire, on 31 July 2006.

===RPAS===
In January 2004, a new unit, No. 1115 Flight, was formed at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada to operate the RAF&#x27;s first Remotely-piloted Air System (RPAS). Operating the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, the unit was embedded with the United States Air Force as part of the Joint Predator Task Force. The RAF crews, integrated with 42nd Attack Squadron, began training on the General Atomics MQ-9A Reaper in late 2006. No. 39 Squadron was reformed on 1 January 2007 at Creech AFB, parented by RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. The former No. 1115 Flight became &#x27;A&#x27; Flight still operating the Predator, while &#x27;B&#x27; Flight prepared to receive the Reaper. The squadron&#x27;s first Reaper (&quot;ZZ200&quot;) was delivered to Afghanistan in early October 2007, officially entering into RAF service on 31 October. On 9 November 2007, the Ministry of Defence announced that the squadron&#x27;s MQ-9 Reapers had begun operations in Afghanistan against the Taliban. On 23 January 2008, No. 39 Squadron was awarded a new squadron Standard.

On 9 April 2008, MQ-9A Reaper &quot;ZZ200&quot; was destroyed after it made a forced landing in southern Afghanistan in order stop it from falling into insurgents hands. As of March 2009, the squadron operated 12 three-man teams to pilot its Reaper aircraft. Supporting intelligence specialists, Information Communications Technicians, signallers, and meteorologists bring the total number of squadron personnel to around 90. The squadron operated two aircraft but planned to have a total of six by the end of 2009. As of April 2011, five Reaper aircraft were in operation, with a further five on order and as of September 2016, the squadron had ten operational Reaper aircraft, with missions being undertaken in Syria as part of Operation Shader. 

No. 39 Squadron was awarded the battle honour &#x27;Afghanistan 2001–2014&#x27; (without the right to emblazon) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 24 March 2020 due to their participation in Operation Herrick. 

The squadron disbanded in July 2022, with a Reaper Ground Control System returning from Creech AFB to RAF Waddington for use by No. 13 Squadron. No. 39 Squadron managed 90,000 hours of RPAS operations while based at Creech AFB. The last Officer Commanding No. 39 Squadron Group Captain Wigglesworth went on to become the Station Commander for RAF Marham, the former home of No. 39 Squadron, in September 2022. The squadron Standard was laid up in the Rotunda at College Hall Officers’ Mess at Royal Air Force College Cranwell in February 2023.

<text>Sudines (or Soudines) () () was a Babylonian sage. He is mentioned as one of the famous Chaldean mathematicians and astronomer-astrologers by later Roman writers like Strabo (&quot;Geographia&quot; 16:1–6).

==Biography==

Like his predecessor Berossos, Sudines moved from Babylonia and established himself among the Greeks; he was an advisor to King Attalus I (Attalos Soter) of Pergamon. He is said (e.g., by Roman astronomer/astrologer Vettius Valens) to have published tables to compute the motion of the Moon; said to have been used by the Greeks, until superseded by the work of Hipparchus and later by Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaios). Sudines may have been important in transmitting the astronomical knowledge of the Babylonians to the Greeks, but little is known about his work and nothing about his life. He is also said to have been one of the first to assign astrological meaning to gemstones.

==Identity==

While other Chaldean astronomers have been tentatively identified in the cuneiform record, no Akkadian texts have yet been unearthed that reference Sudines. Stevens suggest that his name, however, looks Akkadian, with attestations of similar names like Šum(a)-iddin &quot;He gave the name&quot; or Šum(a)-iddina &quot;He gave me a name&quot; in the cuneiform record from the Neo-Assyrian and Hellenistic periods.

The 2nd century CE Greek author Polyaenus mentions an extispicer named Sudines, a job that this Sudines supposedly performed for King Attalus I of Pergamon, lending credence to the association between the astronomer Sudines and the attested diviner. However, while practitioners of astronomical science in Babylonia frequently also worked with astrological methods of celestial divination, the combination of astronomer and liver omen reader is rare, suggesting that Polyaenus&#x27; and King Attalus&#x27; Sudines is potentially different from the astronomer Sudines. Given the wide array of knowledge assigned to and associated with people named Sudines, it is unclear whether they all refer to the same person. The lack of biographical information about Sudines only adds to this difficulty.

==Astronomy==
Sudines is associated with computations for predicting lunar eclipses, with authors such as Vettius Valens claiming that he used Sudines to compute lunar eclipses. The &quot;use&quot; of Sudines in Valens&#x27; &quot;Anthologies&quot; suggests that he was perhaps the author of a table of data relating to lunar eclipses, recording the dates, times, or circumstances of previous ones that later authors could use to inform their theories. Such tables are attested in the cuneiform record, where observations of lunar eclipses were recorded for the greater part of the first millennium BCE and tables made of both observed and predicted eclipses. While no table authored by Sudines has been found or is mentioned in other sources, the abundance of Babylonian tables that have survived suggests that they were an integral component of astronomical practice in this Mesopotamian culture. As a Babylonian, it is not unlikely that Sudines collaborated in the construction of astronomical tables. Moreover, other astronomers listed alongside Sudines have astronomical tables attributed to them that are not extant. Hipparchus, a foundational figure in Greek astronomy whose work became the basis for Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, is credited as authoring a solar table that has not survived and has been the topic of much speculation.
Sudines is also credited with a particular value for the length of the solar year. Neugebauer lists Sudines&#x27; solar year length as 365 1/4 , which Rochberg interprets as 365 + 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/5, a value that she describes as making no astronomical sense. Valens references Sudines as a table author immediately after describing various values of year lengths, including two attributed separately to the Chaldeans and the Babylonians (&quot;Anthologies&quot; 9.12). Neither the Chaldean year length of 365 1/4 1/207 nor the Babylonian year length of 365 1/4 1/144 agrees with Sudines&#x27; value.

In a 3rd century CE papyrus fragment containing a summary of a commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, the Stoic philosopher Posidonius is listed as crediting Sudines with describing the planet Venus as the destroyer of women. Identifying planets as &quot;destroyers&quot; fits in to a larger discussion of the influences and Aristotelian qualities of the five planets, the sun, and the moon. Sudines&#x27; alleged participation in astrological as well as astronomical work fits in with Babylonian standards that did not explicitly differentiate between the two fields.

==References in classical sources==
Sudines is referenced in Greek and Latin texts as an expert on three topics: astrological knowledge, liver divination (hepatoscopy), and properties of stones and gems. Often he is listed alongside other known Babylonian astronomers. In addition to Sudines, Vettius Valens lists Kidenas, a Babylonian astronomer known from other references in Greek sources as well as the colophons of some Babylonian ephemerides. Valens also references Greek astronomers Hipparchus and Apollinarius who are both known to have iterated over Babylonian arithmetic methods and to have used Babylonian parameters and observations as integral parts of their astronomical theories.

In addition to the sources listed below, Stevens points to a reference to from a list of canonographers from a Vatican &quot;Aratea&quot; manuscript (Vat gr. 381).
