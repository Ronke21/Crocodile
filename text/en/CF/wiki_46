<text>ZM ( ) is a New Zealand contemporary hit radio network owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment. It broadcasts 19 markets throughout mainland New Zealand via terrestrial FM, and worldwide via the Internet. The network targets the 15–39 demographic specialises in a chart-music playlist of pop, rock, hip hop and dance music. It reaches approximately 486,800 listeners weekly, making it the fifth largest commercial radio station in New Zealand.

The ZM network as it is today was founded in the early 1970s as three separate commercial music stations owned by Radio New Zealand in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The name is derived from the former callsigns of the stations: 1ZM, 2ZM and 3ZM. The stations were carved off to The Radio Network (now merged into New Zealand Media and Entertainment) in 1996, and ZM spread across the country, originally as three separate networks before finally merging to form one nationwide network in 2000.

The network&#x27;s head office and main studios are based in Auckland, where all of the programming is produced.

==ZM history==

===Early years===
*ZM in its current format was first started in 1973 by the government owned New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (which became Radio New Zealand in 1975). The three original ZM stations were based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch and had been on air for the past few decades most recently as 1YD, 2YD and 3ZM in their respective markets.
*The three original stations were known by their ZM call signs, 1ZM in Auckland on 1250AM, 2ZM in Wellington on 1130AM and 3ZM in Christchurch on 1400AM.
*In 1978 the AM frequency step in New Zealand was changed from a 10 kHz step to a 9 kHz step as a result all three stations changed frequencies. 1ZM moved to 1251 kHz, 2ZM Wellington moved to 1161 kHz but sometimes branded as 1162ZM and 3ZM Christchurch moved to 1323 kHz.

===1980s===

====Overnight programming====
*In 1981, Radio New Zealand stations were finally granted the right to broadcast 24 hours per day; previously only the domain of private operators. Overnight networked programming was introduced with the ZM All-Nighter show. Programming was produced from the 1ZM studios in Auckland and networked to 2ZM Wellington and 3ZM Christchurch. 2ZK in Hawkes Bay and 4ZG in Gore also took the ZM All-Nighter. Programming was also networked to the ZMFM station introduced in Palmerston North in 1987. The show was offered as an &#x27;alternative music choice to the top 40-based formats offered by the private stations and was originally hosted by Barry Jenkin from Auckland. With his departure in 1983, the alternative format remained, but the music played was more top-40-based with the large percentage of NZ music. In 1987 with 1ZM dropping the ZM brand name The ZM All Nighter became known as &quot;The All Nighter&quot; on all stations. In 1989 The All Nighter was discontinued and stations that previously took this show now ran local shows or an automated show with no announcer.

====Auckland 1ZM becomes Classic Hits====
* In 1982, 1ZM Auckland lost its bid for an FM licence and with the Broadcasting Tribunal allowing two new private radio stations (Magic 91FM and 89 Stereo FM) into the Auckland market, 1ZM was required to re format and adopt a &#x27;Limited Sponsorship&#x27; model in place of its full commercial licence. This was an attempt to assist the new operators in establishing a revenue base. For 1ZM this meant that although the station could still run paid-for advertisements, those messages could not have music underneath, mention price or be longer than 25 words. Within 2–3 years, both 1ZM&#x27;s financial and audience market share dropped significantly as advertisers and young listeners were attracted by the higher quality sound of the FM stations, despite the absence of long commercial breaks on 1ZM. 1ZM at the time promoted itself as &quot;Total Music ZM&quot; to emphasise the limited commercial format.
* By 1987 1ZM Auckland was still a limited commercial station. A decision was made to change the format of 1ZM from a Contemporary Hit Radio format to a Classic Hits format. The Auckland station was rebranded as &quot;Classic Hits Twelve 51&quot; which subsequently marked the birth of the Classic Hits brand which would be rolled out across New Zealand years later.
* In 1989 Auckland&#x27;s Classic Hits Twelve 51 was finally given a licence to broadcast on FM and broadcast commercials. The station launched on 97.4FM as &quot;Classic Hits 97FM.&quot; The 1251 kHz frequency licence was transferred to Christian broadcaster Radio Rhema. In 1993 the format of &quot;Classic Hits 97FM&quot; was rolled out across New Zealand with local stations operated by Radio New Zealand taking on the same format and branding, ultimately all these stations became the Classic Hits network in 2001, and later The Hits network in 2014.

====Wellington 2ZM and Christchurch 3ZM switch to FM====
*The ZM stations in Christchurch and Wellington were not affected by the changes made to the Auckland station. In 1985 2ZM Wellington switched to FM broadcasting on 90.9FM and in 1986 Christchurch also made the move to FM broadcasting on 91.3FM. Following the change, both stations rebranded to become &quot;Hit Radio ZMFM&quot;. 
*In 1987 a ZMFM station was established in Palmerston North on 90.6FM with a local breakfast show, but all programming outside breakfast was networked from Wellington. This station became a local station in 1989 branded as 2QQ.
*In 1989 ZMFM Christchurch became known as &quot;91 Stereo ZM&quot; and later &quot;91ZM&quot;.

===1990s===

====Branding====
*Both 91ZM Christchurch and ZMFM Wellington used the slogan &quot;Rock of the Nineties&quot; during the early 1990s. In late 1994 ZMFM Wellington was rebranded to &quot;91ZM&quot; using the same logo as 91ZM Christchurch. Both stations changed the slogan to &quot;Just Great Music of the 80s and 90s&quot;.
*In 1997 ZM changed their logo on all stations to include a green globe behind the station name. At the same time the station slogan was changed to &quot;Today&#x27;s Hit Music&quot; reflecting the modern music played on the station, this slogan was used until 2014.

====Privatisation====
*In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the ZM stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News &amp; Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network.

====Expansion and early network programming====
*A new ZM station was established in Northland in 1995 as 93ZM this station was a completely local station at this point.
*The very first networked ZM station was established in Dunedin in 1996 as 96ZM, this station was networked from 91ZM studios in Christchurch using an automated computer system allowing announcers in Christchurch to produce localised voice breaks for Dunedin recorded minutes earlier. On air announcers called the station Dunedin&#x27;s 96ZM but during shows with a high amount of talk such as breakfast one voice break was produced for both Dunedin and Christchurch where the station was simply called ZM. 
*In 1997 programming was extended to Invercargill on 95.6FM as 96ZM, networked from 91ZM Christchurch with localised voice breaks, the same as 96ZM Dunedin. Also in 1997 ZM returned to Palmerston North on the 90.6FM frequency that had been used to broadcast ZMFM to Palmerston North in the late 1980s. 91ZM Palmerston North took network programming from 91ZM Wellington with localised voice breaks similar to Dunedin and Invercargill.
*In late 1996 The Radio Network purchased the assets of Prospect Media, which included Radio Hauraki and Easy Listening i. The sale also included local stations in Auckland and Hamilton which at the time were both branded as The Breeze, and were separately owned from The Breeze station in Wellington. In 1997 both The Breeze in Auckland and Hamilton were closed down and a new local ZM station was started in Auckland on 91.0FM as &quot;91ZM&quot;, a ZM station was also started on 89.8FM in Hamilton as &quot;89.8ZM&quot;
*In 1997 local programming was dropped on 93ZM Northland excluding the breakfast show with all other programming becoming networked from Auckland. The Northland breakfast team were moved to Hamilton in 1998 with programming networked back to Northland, at other times both stations carried 91ZM Auckland programming.
*Programming was extended to Rotorua in 1998 as 98ZM replacing local station Classic Rock 98.3FM, initially a local ZM station but later networked from Auckland. A new station was also established in Taranaki as 98.8ZM.
*In 1999 programming was extended to Hawkes Bay on the former Radio Hauraki 95.9FM frequency. Previously this frequency was used for Classic Rock 96FM.
*Nationwide networked programming was introduced in 1997 first with the ZM Essential 30 Countdown on Saturday afternoons. Shortly after the ZM Club Mix was introduced on Saturday nights.
*A nationwide night show was introduced on weeknights in 1998, 91ZM Christchurch announcer Willy Macalister was moved to Auckland to present this show.

===2000s===

====Nationwide Network programming====
*By 2000 ZM was broadcasting in Invercargill and Dunedin networked from Christchurch, Palmerston North networked from Wellington and had established a northern network with Hawkes Bay, Rotorua, Taranaki, Waikato and Northland all receiving networked programming from Auckland. The Waikato programme could also be heard in the Bay of Plenty.
*In 2000 ZM changed to a single network format, all ZM stations in smaller regions became part of this network based from Auckland the only regions not originally affected were Christchurch and Wellington where these stations remained local except during the evenings and overnight where ZM ran a nationwide night show. Voice breaks that were previously prerecorded for each region and targeted towards the local audience were replaced with live voice breaks tailored to a nationwide audience. At first, these changes were not popular particularly in regions where the announcer lineup changed due to receiving the Auckland-based ZM station instead of the Wellington or Christchurch based station. The original nationwide network lineup consisted of Marcus Lush on breakfast with &quot;The Marcus Lush breakfast show&quot;, Nicki Sunderland and Lana Coc-Kroft presenting the daytime show, Mike McClung and Tim Homer presenting drive and Geoff Stagg on nights. 
*In 2001 more changes were made and this time Christchurch and Wellington were integrated into the network. The Christchurch studio was closed altogether with 91ZM Christchurch drive announcer Jason Royal and producer Jason Winstanley (Staino) moved to Auckland to present a nationwide drive show. Wellington ZM remained local but local Wellington breakfast announcers Polly Gillespie, Nick Tansley and Grant Kareama became the hosts of a new nationwide breakfast show still presented from Wellington. At first some breakfast show content in Wellington varied to the rest of the country such as separate news bulletins and the final hour of the show only being heard in Wellington, by 2002 the breakfast show was the same in all regions.
*In 2003 more changes were made to the announcer lineup. The Radio Network hired shock jock Iain Stables to present the ZM drive show with Jason Royal moved to the daytime show. Former 2XS FM Palmerston North announcer Stu Tolan was hired to present the night show and later Jacqui Jenson became co-host. Later in 2003 the amount of local content on ZM in Wellington was reduced after Wellington drive announcer Julian Burn left, and he was not replaced but instead the nationwide drive show, then hosted by Iain Stables, was networked into Wellington. Local weekend programming in Wellington was also reduced in 2005.
*In 2005 the ZM Christchurch studio was reopened and ZM was local in Christchurch during the Daytime (10 am–3 pm), as well as between 10 am–2 pm on Saturdays. The Daytime 10 am–3 pm announcer in Auckland produced two separate shows simultaneously, one exclusively for Auckland and another for the rest of the ZM Network, a technique used by various other Auckland radio stations including Classic Hits FM, The Breeze &amp; Coast.
*At the end of 2008 Wellington dropped its local daytime and Saturday brunch show and now takes the network versions of these shows, and exactly the same changes affected ZM Christchurch during the middle of 2009. This saw the Christchurch studio facing closure, however the Wellington studio remained until 2014 as it housed the nationwide ZM Morning Crew then presented by Polly and Grant.
* Several new stations have been set up to carry network programming. Early network stations include ZM Gisborne in 2002, ZM Wanganui in 2004, and ZM South Canterbury in September 2004. Later network stations include ZM Blenheim in 2007, ZM Wairarapa in 2010, ZM Taupo in 2013, ZM Queenstown in May 2014, ZM West Coast in 2020 and ZM Coromandel in 2021.

===2010s===
====Launch of online content====
*Early internet streams of ZM date back to the late 1990s when 91ZM Wellington had an internet stream available on their website. For most of the 2000s the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch stations could be streamed online. In December 2010, the station launched a new online stream of ZM, where in a New Zealand radio first, the stream became the 20th ZM station to connect to the network in the same way regional markets do. The change meant ZM Online now had its own imaging &amp; commercials. Local ads, weather and traffic were removed from the online station.
*ZM launched its own iPhone App in 2011. The app displayed all of the ZM website content, and also streamed the station live. An Android app was later launched.
*In line with all TRN stations ZM became available on iHeartRadio after its New Zealand launch in August 2013.

====Change in format and announcer lineup====
*In April 2014 it was announced that long standing breakfast hosts Polly Gillespie &amp; Grant Kereama (Over 20 Years in Wellington Market &amp; 13 Years Nationally) were stepping aside from the station in order to continue their show on the new Radio Network station The Hits. Their last show on the station was on 24 April. Their replacements were immediately announced as the high-profile signings of Cärl &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher, Vaughan Smith &amp; Megan Papas who defected from rival station The Edge.
*In April 2014 the ZM network named The Fletch, Vaughan &amp; Megan Show as their new breakfast show. It consists of Cärl &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher, Vaughan Smith and Megan Papas.
*The show shuffle also saw the Ad-Free 50s being dropped.
*The ZM30 (formerly the daily ZM20) on Juice TV hosted by Guy and Georgia Saturday 6pm and Sunday 9am finished screening when Juice was replaced by Garage TV on 15 May 2015
*Jay and Flynny finished their show on 19 December 2014 after six years together and Flynny being on ZM for over a decade. They were replaced by Jase &amp; PJ. 
*In December 2016, it was announced that The Night Show with Guy and Georgia would be replaced by The ZM Snapchart with Cam Mansel.
*At the end of 2017, Jase &amp; PJ departed the drive show. Until July 2018 the ZM Drive show consisted of edited best bits of their Breakfast show from Australia on KIIS 101.1.
*In July 2018, Bree &amp; Clint replaced the pre-recorded best bits of Jase &amp; PJ. The Jase &amp; PJ highlight clip show had been moved to Saturday and Sunday mornings (which have now been terminated)
*In December 2020, with the announcement of Megan Papas’ pregnancy came the announcement that comedian Hayley Sproull would temporarily take the place of Megan Papas until May 2021.
*In 2021, ZM rebranded its night show to the ZM’s Late Show, still presented by Cam Mansel, as well as adding a new ZM’s Late Late Show presented by Meg Wyatt and Ella Shepherd.
*In December 2021, it was announced that Megan Papas would move to The Hits starting Feb 1st, and would be on leave until then. Hayley Sproull will join Cärl &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher, Vaughan Smith for the breakfast show from 2022, although it was unclear if Hayley will be the permanent replacement for Megan.

===ZMonline===
In early December 2010, ZM relaunched its online stream as a new station, rather than relaying an existing station as it had done previously. It became the 20th ZM station to connect to the network in the same way regional markets do. This gave ZMonline its own imaging &amp; commercial options.

Local ads, weather and traffic are removed from the online station (as these are available on demand for every market inside the ZM iPhone and android apps). At the moment through every second commercial break the station plays a song.

===ZM News Service===
Like most radio stations in New Zealand ZM originally featured news on the hour every hour originally news was provided by the Radio New Zealand News Service, following the sale of the Radio New Zealand commercial service this became The Radio Network News Service. In 1997 ZM stations began reducing news breaks to only play on the breakfast show, this was at time when some radio stations began increasing the amount of music played in an hour and reducing talk. In 2000 ZM started their own news service called &quot;ZM Newsbeat&quot;.

The Newsfeed service (formerly called Newsbeat) has news reports read out and local weather updated from the Auckland studio for each individual region. The bulletins are sourced from the NZME newsroom (Newstalk ZB &amp; NZ Herald), and air hourly during weekdays between 6am-9am inclusive with newsreader Brin Rudkin, who also presents Newsfeed updates on The Hits, Radio Hauraki, Coast and Flava. 

An exclusive Wellington edition of &quot;ZM Newsbeat&quot; was aired during the Morning Crew&#x27;s show up until early 2006, when it was dropped for the national edition. In April 2014 Newsbeat was renamed to Newsfeed coinciding with the re-launch of ZM, at the same time the Newsfeed service was introduced on The Hits with the former ZM news readers moved over to The Hits.

Timesaver Traffic reports are read out on air from NZME&#x27;s Auckland studios for larger regions in New Zealand, for Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton, Tauranga and Dunedin. Other stations play advertisements during these times. Wellington originally ran their own local traffic reports until 2006.

10 second weather updates are read out on weekdays and air before the Newsfeed updates. Individual weather reports are pre-recorded for each region and updated with each show. When the Morning Crew were based in Wellington, they read out the Wellington weather live during the breakfast show, while the pre-recorded reports by the newsreader air over the rest of the network.

Former Newsbeat and Newsfeed presenters include Glen Stuart, Bridget Hastie, Debbie Griffiths, Dan Bernstone, Ash Thomas, Adam Cooper, Paul Stenhouse, Jacob Brown, Rachel Jackson-Lees, Lee Plummer and Sam Worthington.

<text>Alison Wearing (born 1967) is a Canadian writer and performer most noted for her memoir and solo play, &quot;Confessions of a Fairy&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Wearing, born in Peterborough, Ontario, studied French, music, and political science across various universities in Canada and Germany. She began her writing career in Prague, publishing articles, stories, and winning awards for her travel writing. Her first book, &quot;Honeymoon in Purdah&quot;, a travel memoir about her trip to Iran, received international acclaim. After relocating to Mexico in 2002, she ventured into performing arts, winning awards for her solo play &quot;Giving Into Light&quot;. &quot;Confessions of a Fairy&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a memoir and solo play, shares her experience growing up with a gay father in the 1980s. Her 2020 book, &quot;Moments of Glad Grace&quot;, explores the relationship between a daughter and her aging father. Wearing has held various literary positions, including writer-in-residence and distinguished visiting fellow, and facilitates Memoir Writing Ink, an online writing program.

== Early years and education ==
Wearing was born in Peterborough, Ontario, in 1967. Her mother and father were both pianists and Wearing speaks of music as her &quot;mother tongue&quot;. Wearing&#x27;s father, Joseph Wearing, was also a professor of political studies at Trent University. Alison Wearing left high school in Canada to study French at the University of Nantes. She returned to Canada to study music at the University of Western Ontario, then political science at Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Marburg, Germany.

==Career==
Wearing&#x27;s writing career began with articles and stories written while living in Prague, where she taught English to members of Václav Havel&#x27;s first post-revolutionary government of Czechoslovakia. Her first short story, &quot;Notes From Under Water&quot;, was published first in the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; and then selected for the Journey Prize Anthology (McClelland and Stewart, 1994). &quot;Staring Down the Beast&quot;, a longform essay about travels in Serbia during the Balkan War, won the 1994 Canadian National Magazine Award Gold Medal for Travel Writing. &quot;Solitary Motion&quot;, an essay about travels in northwestern China, won the 1995 Western Canada Magazine Award 1st Prize, also for Travel Writing.

Wearing&#x27;s first book was the internationally acclaimed travel memoir, &quot;Honeymoon in Purdah&quot; (Alfred A. Knopf Canada, 2000), her account of a trip to Iran. The &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; called it &quot;the perfect travel memoir&quot; and the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; hailed it as &quot;one of the best pieces of travel writing it has been my privilege to read in this, or any, millennium&quot;. The book was published in seven countries.

After moving to central Mexico in 2002, Wearing turned her attention to the performing arts, singing, recording and touring with world/folk musician Jarmo Jalava, and studying dance and choreography. Her first solo play, &quot;Giving Into Light,&quot; combines literary chronicles with music and dance. It toured Canadian fringe festivals, where it won two Best of Fest awards, Best Drama, and was a finalist for Best Fringe Production of 2012 (CBC/CTV/CVV).

&quot;Confessions of a Fairy&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, is both a memoir (Alfred A. Knopf Canada, 2013) and a solo play. Autobiographical in nature, &quot;Confessions of a Fairy&#x27;s Daughter&quot; tells the story of growing up with a gay father in Peterborough, Canada, in the 1980s. The memoir was nominated for the RBC/Taylor Prize for Non-Fiction, shortlisted for the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Nonfiction, and named one of the top 50 Books of 2013 by Indigo Books.

&quot;Moments of Glad Grace&quot; (ECW Press) was published in 2020. &quot;This is a wise, funny, and tender book, beautifully written and perfectly executed from first to last sentence. It&#x27;s about a daughter and her ageing father, it&#x27;s about genealogy and identity, it&#x27;s about Ireland, but actually it&#x27;s about how we love the ones we love. &quot;Moments of Glad Grace&quot; is a travelogue of the heart. It&#x27;s a road you&#x27;ll want to travel.&quot; – Yann Martel, author of &quot;Life of Pi&quot;.

Wearing has served as a juror for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language non-fiction, a reader for the CBC Literary Prize, a mentor for the University of Guelph MFA Creative Writing program, a faculty member of the Under The Volcano masterclass program, and writer-in-residence at Trent University, the University of Guelph, and Green College, University of British Columbia, where she has since been appointed a distinguished visiting fellow.

Wearing facilitates Memoir Writing Ink, an online writing program, and administers the International Amy MacRae Award for Memoir.

<text>Open64 is a free, open-source, optimizing compiler for the Itanium and x86-64 microprocessor architectures. It derives from the SGI compilers for the MIPS R10000 processor, called &quot;MIPSPro&quot;. It was initially released in 2000 as GNU GPL software under the name Pro64. The following year, University of Delaware adopted the project and renamed the compiler to Open64. It now mostly serves as a research platform for compiler and computer architecture research groups. Open64 supports Fortran 77/95 and C/C++, as well as the shared memory programming model OpenMP. It can conduct high-quality interprocedural analysis, data-flow analysis, data dependence analysis, and array region analysis. Development has ceased, although other projects can use the project&#x27;s source.

== The infrastructure ==
Its major components are the frontend for C/C++ (using GCC) and Fortran 77/90 (using the CraySoft front-end and libraries), Interprocedural analysis (IPA), loop nest optimizer (LNO), global optimizer (WOPT), and code generator (CG). Despite being initially written for a single computer architecture, Open64 has proven that it can generate efficient code for CISC, RISC, and VLIW architectures, including MIPS, x86, IA-64, ARM, and others.

== Intermediate representation ==
A hierarchical intermediate representation (IR) with five main levels is used in this compiler to serve as the common interface among all the frontend and backend components. This IR is named WHIRL.

== Versions ==
The original version of Open64 that was released in 2002 was missing its very advanced software pipelining code generator, and had only a rudimentary code generator for Itanium. The entire original MIPSPro compiler, with this code generator, is available under a commercial license as the Blackbird compiler from Reservoir Labs. The Showdown Paper documents the code generator that was not included in Open64. The very advanced compiler from Tilera, for its 64-core TILE64 chip, is based on Blackbird.

Open64 exists in many forks, each of which has different features and limitations. The &quot;classic&quot; Open64 branch is the Open Research Compiler (ORC), which produces code only for the Itanium (IA-64), and was funded by Intel. The ORC effort ended in 2003, and the current official branch (which originated from the Intel ORC project) is managed by Hewlett-Packard and the University of Delaware&#x27;s Computer Architecture and Parallel Systems Laboratory (CAPSL).

Other important branches include the compilers from Tensilica and the AMD x86 Open64 Compiler Suite.

Nvidia is also using an Open64 fork to optimize code in its CUDA toolchain.

Open64 is used as the backend for the HPE NonStop OS compilers on the x86-64 platform.

=== Open64 releases ===
=== AMD x86 Open64 releases ===
== Current development projects ==
Open64 is also used in a number of research projects, such as the Unified Parallel C (UPC) and speculative multithreading work at various universities. The 2010 Open64 Developers Forum describes projects done at Absoft, AMD, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fudan University, HP, National Tsing Hua University, Nvidia, Tensilica, Tsinghua University, and University of Houston. The Chinese Academy of Sciences ported Open64 to the Loongson II platform.

AMD has extended and productized Open64 with optimizations designed for x86 multi-core processor advancements and multi-threaded code development. AMD supports Open64 as a complementary compiler to GCC.

The University of Houston&#x27;s OpenUH project, which is based on Open64, released a new version of its compiler suite in November 2015.

<text>Wester Shadric Cooley (March 28, 1932 – February 4, 2015) was a Republican politician and rancher from Oregon. He was a U.S. Representative from for the 1995–1997 term.

==Early life==
Cooley was born in Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Leuzinger High School and served in the United States Army from 1952 to 1954, and is described in the &quot;Biographical Directory of the United States Congress&quot; as a rancher. He owned the vitamin supplements company Rose Laboratories. Cooley graduated from the University of Southern California with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1958.

==Political career==
Cooley was elected to the Oregon State Senate in 1992. In 1994, midway through his State Senate term, Cooley was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from the 2nd District.

In the 104th Congress, Cooley was an advocate of private property rights, American military superiority, tort reform to limit recovery by plaintiffs, and other planks of the Republican Party&#x27;s proclaimed Contract with America.

In April 1996, the Medford, Oregon &quot;Mail Tribune&quot; questioned Cooley&#x27;s statement in the 1994 Voter&#x27;s Guide that he had served in the Army Special Forces in Korea. Charges also arose that Cooley and his wife kept their marriage secret for several years in order for her to continue to receive veteran&#x27;s benefits from her prior marriage. Cooley was unopposed for renomination in the May primary and vigorously denied the charges; however, he came under increasing pressure from fellow Republicans, including his campaign manager Greg Walden and House speaker Newt Gingrich, to step down. Walden even went as far as to announce an independent run for the seat, but implied that he would serve as a Republican if elected.

In August 1996, Cooley withdrew from the race. A special nominating convention chose former six-term incumbent Republican Bob Smith, who had retired two years earlier, to replace Cooley on the ballot. Smith went on to defeat Democrat Mike Dugan in the November election.

In December, Cooley was indicted for lying about his military service in the 1994 voter&#x27;s pamphlet. While claiming that the documents proving his claim were destroyed in a fire, Cooley later accepted a plea agreement in which he was convicted of lying in an official document and sentenced to probation, community service, and ordered to pay a fine.

==Tax evasion conviction==
On January 29, 2009, Cooley was indicted in California for his role in an alleged investment scheme associated with the sale of shares of Bidbay.com. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported that prosecutors alleged more than $10 million was defrauded from investors in the Bidbay sale of shares based on false statements. Cooley was charged with six counts of money laundering and one count of filing a false tax return in 2002 in an attempt to conceal more than $1.1 million in illicit income.

In December 2012, Cooley was sentenced to a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to hiding $494,000 in income from the Internal Revenue Service. He was further ordered to pay back taxes of $138,470 and restitution of $3.5 million to the victims of the Bidbay investment fraud scheme.

==Death==
Cooley died on February 4, 2015, in Bend, Oregon.

<text>Other People&#x27;s Songs is a cover album by English synth-pop duo Erasure released on 27 January 2003.

The album was originally conceived as a solo project for singer Andy Bell. Once Vince Clarke, the other member of Erasure, became involved, it was released as Erasure&#x27;s tenth studio album. The tracks were handpicked by Clarke and Bell as ones that influenced them as musicians. It was released in the UK and the US by Mute Records in 2003, and was a Top 20 success in their home country and in Germany.

&quot;Other People&#x27;s Songs&quot; gave Erasure their first Top 10 on the UK singles chart in nine years with their cover of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;. The album was produced by Erasure with Gareth Jones and Dave Bascombe. Because of Bell&#x27;s resistance to remaking the classic &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, the verses are &quot;sung&quot; synthetically by a computer.

==Track listing==
==2016 &quot;Erasure 30&quot; 30th anniversary BMG reissue LP==
Subsequent to their acquisition of Erasure&#x27;s back catalogue, and in anticipation of the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, BMG commissioned reissues of all previously released UK editions of Erasure albums up to and including 2007&#x27;s &quot;Light at the End of the World&quot;. All titles were pressed and distributed by Play It Again Sam on 180-gramme vinyl and shrinkwrapped with a custom anniversary sticker.

<doc id="954036" wikidata="Q19576" url="?curid=954036" title="Wilayah">
<text>A wilayah ( or &quot;wilāya&quot;, plural ; Urdu, Pashto and ; ) is an administrative division, usually translated as &quot;state&quot;, &quot;province&quot; or occasionally as &quot;governorate&quot;. The word comes from the Arabic root &quot;w-l-y&quot;, &quot;to govern&quot;: a &quot;wāli&quot;—&quot;governor&quot;—governs a &quot;wālāya&quot; (or &quot;wilāya&quot;), &quot;that which is governed&quot;. Under the Caliphate, the term referred to any constituent near-sovereign state.

== Use in specific countries ==
In Arabic, &quot;wilayah&quot; is used to refer to the states of the United States, and the United States of America as a whole is called &quot;al-Wilāyāt al-Muttaḥidah al-Amrīkīyah&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the American United States&quot;.

=== North Africa and Middle East ===
For Morocco, which is divided into provinces &quot;and&quot; wilāyas, the translation &quot;province&quot; would cause the distinction to cease. For Sudan, the term &quot;state&quot; and for Mauritania, the term &quot;region&quot; is used.
* Provinces of Algeria
* Provinces of Oman
* Regions of Mauritania
* States of Sudan
* Governorates of Tunisia

The governorates of Iraq (muhafazah) are sometimes translated as provinces, in contrast to official Iraqi documents and the general use for other Arab countries. This conflicts somehow with the general translation for &quot;muhafazah&quot; (governorate) and &quot;wilāyah&quot; (province).

=== China ===
In the ethnically diverse Xinjiang region of Northwest China, the seven undifferentiated prefectures proper (; that is, not prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures, etc.) are translated into the Uygur language as &quot;Vilayiti&quot; (). For the other, more numerous types of administrative divisions in Xinjiang, however, Uygur uses Russian loanwords like &quot;oblasti&quot; or &quot;rayoni&quot;, in common with other Xinjiang languages like Kazakh.

=== Kenya and Tanzania ===
In Kenya and Tanzania, the term &quot;wilaya&quot; is a Swahili term which refers to the administrative districts into which provinces are divided.
* Districts of Kenya
* Districts of Tanzania

=== Southeast Asia ===
In Malay (both in Malaysian and Indonesian standards) and Tausug, &quot;wilayah&quot; or &quot;wilāya&quot; is a general word meaning &quot;territory&quot;, &quot;area&quot; or &quot;region&quot;.

In Thailand, it is the standard Malay term used to translate a &quot;province&quot;&quot;.

In Malaysia, the term
* &quot;Wilayah Persekutuan&quot;, often shortened to &quot;Wilayah&quot; in colloquial speech, refers to the three federal territories under direct control of the federal government: Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya.
* &quot;Wilayah Ekonomi Pantai Timur&quot;, is translated as East Coast Economic Region

In the Philippines, the term
* &quot;Wilāya sin Lupa&#x27; Sūg&quot; refers to the province of Sulu, Philippines.

=== Ottoman Empire ===

Traditionally the provinces of the Ottoman Empire were known as &quot;eyâlet&quot;s, but beginning in 1864, they were gradually restructured as smaller &quot;vilâyet&quot;s—the Turkish pronunciation of the Arabic word &quot;wilāyah&quot;. Most were subdivided into sanjaks.

The current provinces of Turkey are called &quot;il&quot; in Turkish.

=== Islamic State ===
The territory under the governance of the Islamic State (ISIS) is referred to them as officially being divided into &quot;wilayah&quot;, often translated into English as &quot;province&quot;. An example is Islamic State – Khorasan Province and Islamic State - West Africa Province.

=== Central Asia and Caucasus ===
The Persian word for &quot;province&quot; (&quot;velâyat&quot;) is still used in several similar forms in Central Asian countries:
* Provinces of Afghanistan (, &quot;wilāyat&quot;, plural: ولايتونه, &quot;wilāyatuna&quot;), subdivided into districts (, &quot;wuləswāləi&quot; or , &quot;wolaswālī&quot;)
* Regions of Tajikistan (singular: viloyat, plural: viloyatho), subdivided into districts (, &quot;nohiya&quot; or , &quot;raion&quot;)
* Regions of Turkmenistan (singular: welaýat, plural: welaýatlar), subdivided into districts ()
* Regions of Uzbekistan (singular: viloyat, plural: viloyatlar), subdivided into districts ()

During the Soviet period the divisions of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were called &quot;oblasts&quot; and &quot;raions&quot;, using Russian terminology.

In the Tsez language, the districts of Dagestan are also referred to as &quot;вилайат&quot; (&quot;wilayat&quot;), plural &quot;вилайатйоби&quot; (&quot;wilayatyobi&quot;). But the term &quot;район&quot; (&quot;rayon&quot;), plural &quot;районйаби&quot; (&quot;rayonyabi&quot;) is also used.

Caucasus Emirate, a self-proclaimed successor state to the unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, is divided into vilayats.

=== South Asia ===
The Persian word for province (velâyat) is still used in several similar forms in South Asian countries as well:

(Pashto: ولايت, wilāyat, plural: ولايتونه, wilāyatuna), subdivided into districts (Pashto: ولسوالۍ, wuləswāləi or Persian: ولسوالی, wolaswālī)

In Urdu, the term &quot;Vilayat&quot; is used to refer to any foreign country. As an adjective &quot;Vilayati&quot; is used to indicate an imported article or good. 

In Bengali and Assamese, the term is &quot;bilat&quot; and &quot;bilati&quot; (archaic &quot;bilaiti&quot;), referring exclusively to Britain and British-made. The British slang term blighty derives from this word, via the fact that the foreign British were referred to using this word during the time of the British Raj.

<text>Baby Blues is an American comic strip created and produced by Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott since January 7, 1990. Distributed by King Features Syndicate from 1995 until January 2022, and distributed by Andrews McMeel Syndication as of January 2022, the strip focuses on the MacPherson family and specifically on the raising of the three MacPherson children.

When the strip debuted, the MacPherson family consisted of Darryl and Wanda and newborn Zoe. The first strip took place in the hospital room shortly after Zoe was born. Later, two more children—Hammie, the middle child and the only son, and Wren, the youngest child—were added to the family. Both Kirkman and Scott have drawn from their own parenting experiences as a source for the strip&#x27;s content.

==Characters and story==
The strip features three families. The MacPhersons are the main focus. Butch and Bunny together with Yolanda and Mike make occasional appearances.

===Main family (MacPhersons)===
* Darryl MacPherson: The father. Age: 36. His job title is Senior Western Regional Assistant Director of Limited Budgetary Integration and Planning. The company manufactures and sells windshield wipers. Noticeable with his large nose. He is sometimes unaware of his wife&#x27;s exhausted state. In various strips, Zoe, Wren and Hammie wait to meet him right when he gets home from work. In some strips, he appears to dislike a kids&#x27; show called &quot;The Whistling Monkey Cowboy Band&quot;. One example is while Wren is obsessed with the merchandise, Wanda jokingly states that Bill Murray and Robin Williams have recently finished working on a &quot;Whistling Monkey Cowboy Band&quot; film whereupon Darryl retreats to the roof. He also tends to swear when accidentally injuring himself or frustrated which Wren repeats in some strips. He also tends to make mistakes, such as in Wren&#x27;s ultrasound, he mistakes her for a boy. He has red hair, and is an only child.
* Wanda MacPherson (nee Wizowski): The mother. Age: 36. Though she originally had a job as a public relations executive, she chose to become a stay-at-home mother after Zoe was born. However, she becomes frustrated and jealous of the women she regards as better mothers. She is afraid of snakes. She is sometimes upset with her children but still loves them. She often springs into action without thinking twice, such as when she saw a woman hit her child in the middle of the grocery store and promptly intervened whereupon she got into a major scuffle with the woman in question. She later wondered if she did the right thing or not.
* Zoe MacPherson: The oldest sibling (name pronounced ) (first appearance January 7, 1990; her birth starts the strip), age: 10. She tends to fuss the most over what Wanda does. She likes to blame things on Hammie a lot, even when she was the one who actually did something wrong. She is also a major tattletale, to the point of getting withdrawal over it. Originally, her middle name was Jennifer, but a strip dated April 9, 2007, identified her middle name as Madison. Zoe is not usually a brat but an average child. This is represented when she is shown playing with toys, watching children&#x27;s shows, playing with other children, and not having a clear view of the world earlier on in the strip. She, Hammie, and Wren do not have any known cousins because the only aunt they have is single and has no kids. At one point early on, she was a huge fan of Barbie, though her ideas about how she is a fan of Barbie vary between wanting to become a real life Barbie when she grows up (with Barbie related items) or basically using her to beat up her toys while pretending that she&#x27;s some sort of monstrous freak (the latter of which was because of Wanda referring to Barbie as a &quot;freak of nature&quot;). She has a teddy bear named Christina Candle Flower Sparkle Jelly Bean Kissy Mooch. Zoe and Hammie attends the same school, Prickly Pear Elementary School.
* Hamish MacPherson: The middle sibling, usually called Hammie (first appearance: April 29, 1995), age: 7. He has great fondness and uninhibited enthusiasm for trucks, and can tell their model by sight, as proven in several strips. He has freckles and his hair is black like his mom&#x27;s. He is the only MacPherson child who isn&#x27;t a redhead. He did not have freckles until the June 14, 2006, strip. His first words were &quot;buh-dozer&quot; and &quot;bazooka,&quot; much to Wanda&#x27;s dismay. He often likes to tell Wanda or sometimes Darryl when Zoe teases or bullies him, but generally he gets mad less often than Zoe. He also likes annoying Zoe or watching her get into trouble (without doing anything himself). He was named after his great-great-grandfather, who was called &quot;Ham&quot;. His teddy bear is called Twuck. Hammie attends Prickly Pear Elementary School. 
* Wren MacPherson: The youngest sibling (first appearance: October 26, 2002), age: 2. She does not seem to be as much of a nuisance as her older siblings. Wren is a very curious baby. She often is shown climbing on top of things or grabbing at things. She said her first words (First &quot;ma&quot;, then &quot;da&quot; and eventually &quot;no&quot;) on Monday, May 19, 2008. Wanda explained that she thought of her name when a bird collided with a window during breakfast time in the hospital. As of Monday, February 16, 2009, Wren is officially able to stand. She has also learned the words &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, and &quot;%*@#! cramp&quot; (from her father). She has shown an annoyance several times to her parents by holding her legs completely stiff so they couldn&#x27;t change her diaper. More recently, she had her first birthday. On September 27, 2014, she has grown a full head of hair instead of a hair tuft. Her eyes are less wide than the other MacPhersons. She has a teddy bear named Mr. Woogles.

===Additional characters===
* Butch and Bunny: Bunny and her seeming perfection in terms of appearance and lifestyle is the target of any possible jealousy from Wanda. Nearly all main adult characters dislike Bunny and have frequently tricked her in some way or another. Bunny seems to be oblivious to how she irritates Wanda, or anyone else around her. She is similarly oblivious to the needs of others and thereby often comes off as self-centered and tactless. Bunny has a husband, Butch. Together, they have three sons: Bogart (the oldest), and identical twins Wendell John and Wendell Jon. The latter two were born August 10, 2002. In one strip, Zoe has said that when Bunny is not looking, she shuffles the twins, which proves that even Bunny cannot tell the difference between the two. Bunny once commented that she would buy identical twin goldfish for Wendell John and Wendell Jon when they get older. After a long absence from the strip, Bunny returned where it was revealed that she and Butch had a divorce and now has full custody of Bogart and the Wendells.
* Yolanda and Mike: An African-American couple. Yolanda and her husband, Mike, are close friends to the MacPhersons. Together, they have two daughters: Keesha and Dziko (nickname &quot;Dizzy&quot;), the latter of whom was born November 11, 2002.
* Rhonda Wizowski: Wanda&#x27;s younger sister. Enjoys the life of being a single woman, except when given a hard time about not &quot;having children and settling down&quot; by her mother. She usually shows up as the babysitter when Wanda and Darryl go out and leave their children behind. She is sometimes even tricked into babysitting for them. Recently, she is shown wanting to find a partner and start a family. In one series of strips she is shown to have an online relationship with gentleman named Thom, who called her Linda (He said &quot;I love you, Linda&quot;) and caused her to throw wine at her computer; she broke up with him.
* Hugh and Maggie Wizowski: Wanda&#x27;s parents.
* &quot;Mac&quot; and Pauline MacPherson: Darryl&#x27;s parents. Darryl gets his big nose from Mac.
* Keesha: Zoe&#x27;s best friend and neighbor. She has medium brown skin and black hair in braids and is about the same age as Zoe. 
* Dziko: Keesha&#x27;s younger sister and Yolanda and Mike&#x27;s youngest daughter who is a toddler like Wren. She doesn&#x27;t appear as often as her parents and older sister. Her eyes are less wide and more circle shaped like Wren&#x27;s.
* Trent: Best friend of Hammie since kindergarten. He and Hammie like to do all the weird things together (especially to annoy Zoe). Another character of the same name has appeared as a friend of Zoe on May 6, 1997.
* Bogart: The oldest son of Butch and Bunny. He is Zoe&#x27;s age, which is now 9 years old and he has short black hair.
* Ashley: Ashley is one of Zoe&#x27;s friends who has black hair. She has an unnamed pet gerbil and is an only child according to Zoe. In her first appearance (June 20, 2007), Ashley makes it clear that she is a snobby rich girl (i.e.; saying that the MacPhersons&#x27; house was small, asking Zoe if they picked the wall&#x27;s colors for the house, thinking Wanda was the maid). In both the first and last comic strips of the story, Zoe admits her reason for inviting Ashley was so that Wanda and Darryl would appreciate how nice she is.
* Mr. Doyle: Zoe and Keesha&#x27;s teacher.
* Dr. Joseph: Dr. Joseph is the MacPhersons&#x27; doctor, who has blonde hair and a big nose similar to Darryl&#x27;s.
* Bethany is a friend of Zoe, who is never seen nor heard and is only mentioned by Zoe. She threw a boy-girl party and for some reason did not invite Zoe.
* Bryan Barge is a boy in Zoe&#x27;s class who was first mentioned by Zoe on March 5, 2011, as the boy she likes, but doesn&#x27;t know she exists. She is in bed due to this was part of a story where she is sick. He has never appeared in the comic and was only mentioned by several characters in the strip. He is one of the few characters besides the MacPhersons and Wizowskis that have a known last name.

===Cameo appearances===
* November 26, 2022: Sally Brown and Snoopy from &quot;Peanuts&quot;.

==Timeline==
The children in &quot;Baby Blues&quot; have aged as the strip has progressed, although at a slower rate than real-time. Kirkman and Scott have stated that the strip&#x27;s timeline is &quot;about a 3 to 1 ratio.&quot; As of 2021, Zoe, Hammie and Wren are 9, 7, and 2 respectively.

==Books==

=== &quot;Scrapbooks&quot; ===

The first three &quot;Scrapbooks&quot; in the list below were not labelled &quot;scrapbook&quot; and didn&#x27;t get a number, but they can be assumed to be number 1, 2 and 3 in that series because in the time line they precede number 4 of the &quot;Scrapbooks&quot;, and all of these books follow the same concept, i.e. they are collections of &quot;Baby Blues&quot; strips from the newspapers.
Starting with &quot;Scrapbook&quot; 30, the books come in a larger format and contain more strips. &quot;Scrapbooks&quot; are paperbacks.

=== &quot;Treasuries&quot; ===

&quot;Treasuries&quot; are collections / compilations from strips in the &quot;Scrapbooks&quot;. Almost all of the &quot;Treasuries&quot; are paperbacks, just one is a hardcover (marked as &quot;HC&quot; here below).

=== Other collections / compilations ===

These two books are not labelled &quot;treasuries&quot;, but follow a similar concept, i.e. they also repeat strips from the &quot;Scrapbooks&quot;, but emphasize a specific topic (school; the relationship between Darryl and Wanda). They are paperbacks.

=== &quot;Gift Books&quot; ===

These books are collections / compilations similar to the &quot;Treasuries&quot;, but the &quot;Gift Books&quot; are smaller in size and come as hardcovers.

== Television adaptation ==
&quot;Baby Blues&quot; was adapted into an animated television series for The WB. The animated version&#x27;s timeline was from when Darryl and Wanda first gave birth to Zoe. Mike O&#x27;Malley supplied the voice of Darryl while Julia Sweeney played Wanda.

The first eight episodes of &quot;Baby Blues&quot; originally aired on The WB from July 28 to August 24, 2000, before being canceled. The five remaining episodes from the first season eventually aired on Adult Swim in 2002. A second season, consisting of 13 episodes, was produced but never aired.

The television series differed from the comic strip by focusing on Darryl and Wanda&#x27;s relationship with the Bittermans, a neighbor family with three children (Rodney, Megan, and Shelby); Kenny, Darryl&#x27;s co-worker; and Bizzy, the babysitter for Zoe. Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott had only minimal creative control over the television series.

The theme song was &quot;It&#x27;s All Been Done&quot; by the Barenaked Ladies.

==Foreign versions==

&quot;Baby Blues&quot; has been translated into, among others, French, German and Swedish. This strip appeared in Canadian French-language newspapers on January 14, 2006.

<doc id="954070" wikidata="Q6679887" url="?curid=954070" title="Lord Ramage">
<text>Nicholas, Lord Ramage is a fictional character, the protagonist of a series of sea novels written by Dudley Pope. Ramage was an officer in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. He is a contemporary of Horatio Hornblower, but unlike the latter, who never fought in a large fleet battle, Ramage participated in both the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and the Battle of Trafalgar.

==Early life==
This section contains information on Ramage&#x27;s life before the commencement of the Lord Ramage Novels. For information after this period, see the respective summaries of the books.
Nicholas Ramage was born in 1775 at Blazey Hall in Cornwall, the eldest son of the Earl of Blazey. Nicholas&#x27; father was a Vice-Admiral who was court martialled (some sympathetic colleagues felt unjustly so) and Nicholas is burdened by this legacy. Ramage&#x27;s mother was fond of traveling and took Ramage to Tuscany to live in 1777, when his father departed to assume naval command in North America. They returned to England for his father&#x27;s court martial in 1782 and because of the notoriety surrounding his father&#x27;s court martial returned to Tuscany in 1783 where Ramage remained until he joined the navy in 1788 at age 13. Despite his father&#x27;s disgrace, Ramage retained significant patrons within the navy enabling him to be promoted to lieutenant at age 20, the earliest age possible.

<doc id="954075" wikidata="Q2451295" url="?curid=954075" title="Nokia 9210 Communicator">
<text>The Nokia 9210 Communicator is a third-generation Communicator series mobile phone produced by Nokia, announced on 21 November 2000 and released in June 2001. It greatly improved on the second-generation Nokia 9110 Communicator, providing a colour main screen and using an ARM processor. It is one of the few mobile phones able to send and receive fax.

It was the first device to run on the Symbian OS platform, version 6, succeeding version 5 of EPOC. It also introduced Nokia&#x27;s Series 80 interface, which was the result of Symbian Ltd.&#x27;s &#x27;Crystal&#x27; design.

It is used as a normal though bulky mobile phone in closed mode; when it is flipped open it can be used like a very small notebook computer with a 640 × 200 screen. The earpiece and microphone are located on the back so one must hold it with the front screen and keypad facing out to make a call. The phone also has speakerphone functionality.

The 9210 Communicator&#x27;s success helped Nokia overtake both Palm and Compaq to become the leading &#x27;mobile data device&#x27; vendor in Western Europe in the third quarter of 2001, when it had a 28.3 percent share in the market.

==Specifications==
* Main applications: mobile phone, desk application, messaging (SMS, fax, email), Internet (web, WAP), contacts (address book), calendar, office (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation viewer, file manager)
* Extra applications: calculator, clock, games, recorder, and unit converter. In addition, 3rd party software developers could freely implement new applications for the Nokia 9210 Communicator and offer them for download by the users.
* Processor: 32-bit 66 MHz ARM9-based RISC CPU
* Total memory: 24 MB
** Application memory: 14 MB
** User memory: 2 MB
** Execution memory: 8 MB (SD-RAM)
** 16 MB Multi Media Card in the sales package
* Operating frequency: GSM-900/1800 networks in Europe, Africa, Asia
* Radio: foldout antenna for improved reception.
* Operating system: Symbian OS v6.0, Series 80 v1.0
* Interface: IrDA but no Bluetooth, Serial port cable for PC.
* Audio: Stereo-headset, mp3-player software is optional, additional internal speaker for music and full-duplex speakerphone functionality.
* Includes PC Suite for the Nokia 9210 Communicator, running on Windows platform.
* Vibrating alert: not implemented.

===9210i===

The 9210i launched in 2002 increased the internal memory to 40 MB and adds the RealPlayer for video streaming. The web browser now supports Flash 5 and HTML 4.01 instead of HTML 3.2 on the 9210. The main screen backlight was also changed from high voltage CCFL tube light to white LED backlight, which was quite new technology at the time.
* Total memory: 40 MB
** Application memory: 16 MB
** User memory: 16 MB
** Execution memory: 8 MB (SD-RAM)
** 64 MB Multi Media Card in the sales package

==Replacement models==
Nokia replaced the 9210 in first quarter of 2005 with:
* Nokia 9500 – has additional features (Wi-Fi and camera) but is smaller ) and lighter (222 g), and has an updated Symbian Series 80 operating system.
* Nokia 9300 – is smaller () and lighter (167 g) than Nokia 9210, with similar features and the same operating system as the Nokia 9500.

Both new models include other improvements such as: EDGE, colour external displays and Bluetooth.

==Accessories==
* Camera
* Hands free car kit

==Nokia 9290==
The American variant of the 9210i is the Nokia 9290 supporting GSM-1900, first introduced on 5 June 2001 and eventually, after a year-long delay, released on the continent in June 2002.

== In popular culture ==
In the music video for &quot;Dilemma&quot; by Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland, the Nokia 9210 phone can be observed being utilized by Kelly Rowland. However, to the amusement of more technically savvy viewers, the plot of the music video shows the singer typing the alleged message in a spreadsheet application instead of an actual messaging app, which has led to jokes and memes about this video to circulate internet even years after the release of the video.

Another instance of the Nokia 9210 appearing in movies was in the 2003 film &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, where the antagonist character T-X, played by Kristanna Loken, can be seen using the phone as a dial-up modem at the beginning of the movie.

<doc id="954076" wikidata="Q758661" url="?curid=954076" title="Auckland volcanic field">
<text>The Auckland volcanic field is an area of monogenetic volcanoes covered by much of the metropolitan area of Auckland, New Zealand&#x27;s largest city, located in the North Island. The approximately 53 volcanoes in the field have produced a diverse array of maars (explosion craters), tuff rings, scoria cones, and lava flows. With the exception of Rangitoto, no volcano has erupted more than once, but the other eruptions lasted for various periods ranging from a few weeks to several years. Rangitoto erupted several times and recently twice; in an eruption that occurred about 600 years ago, followed by a second eruption approximately 50 years later. The field is fuelled entirely by basaltic magma, unlike the explosive subduction-driven volcanism in the central North Island, such as at Mount Ruapehu and Lake Taupō.

== Features ==

The field ranges from Lake Pupuke and Rangitoto Island in the north to Matukutururu (Wiri Mountain) in the south, and from Mount Albert in the west to Pigeon Mountain in the east.

The first vent erupted at Pupuke 193,200 ± 2,800 years ago. The most recent eruption (about 600 years ago and within historical memory of the local Māori) was of Rangitoto, an island shield volcano just east of the city, erupting 0.7 cubic kilometres of lava. The last volcano to erupt was much bigger than all others, with Rangitoto making up 41 per cent of the field&#x27;s entire volume of erupted material with characteristics as to slope and symmetry around the eruptive vents seen in basaltic shield volcanoes as might be expected in a volcano, that may have buried other volcanoes, and now known to have a 1000-year odd eruptive history. The field&#x27;s other volcanoes are relatively small, with most less than in height.

Lake Pupuke, on the North Shore near Takapuna, is a volcanic explosion crater. A few similar craters such as Ōrākei Basin are open to the sea.

The field has produced voluminous lava flows that cover much of the Auckland isthmus. One of the longest runs from Mt Saint John northward, almost crossing the Waitematā Harbour to form Meola Reef. More than 50 lava tubes and other lava caves have been discovered, including the -long Wiri Lava Cave. There can be an association with lava caves and the formation of rootless cones due to their mechanism of formation and a rootless cone was suggested to exist at Wiri being Matukutūreia. This may not be quite the case even though at least one steam only driven eruption occurred close to Matukutūreia. The second-longest individual cave in the Auckland field, some in total length, is the Cave of a Thousand Press-ups to the east of Maungakiekie/One Tree Hill. Two impressive depressions caused by lava cave collapses are the Puka Street Grotto and the nearby Hochstetter Pond, also known as Grotto Street Pond, in Onehunga.

For most of the 200,000 years that the field has been erupting, the planet has been in glacial periods (ice ages) where sea levels were much lower due to water being locked up as ice, and the Waitemata and Manukau Harbours were dry land. All the volcanoes probably erupted on land except for Rangitoto, which erupted during the current interglacial (warmer) period.

=== Tectonic relationships ===

The Auckland region lies within the Australian Plate, about west of its plate boundary with the Pacific Plate. The volcanoes are located south of a geological region called the Northland Allochthon, and with the northern volcanoes located over early Miocene sedimentary deposits of the Waitematā Group of rocks and the southern volcanoes over post Miocene sediments. A large proportion of the volcanoes in the field, particularly those with cone structures, lie within of inferred or known faults, with the qualification that these are inactive historic faults and unlike in many other volcanic fields it is rare for volcanoes to be actually on the fault line. The structure of these Auckland regional faults and the resulting fault blocks is complex but like the volcanic field their locations can be postulated to be related to gravitational variations and where the Stokes Magnetic Anomaly passes through this section of the North Island.
The field is part of the Auckland Volcanic Province which comprises four volcanic fields with intra-plate basaltic volcanism starting in the south, at Okete, near Raglan in late Pliocene times (2.7-1.8 Ma). Activity has since moved north through the Ngatutura, South Auckland and Auckland fields since then.

== Human context ==
=== Mythology ===

Tāmaki Māori myths describe the creation of the volcanic field as a creation of Mataaho (the guardian of the earth&#x27;s secrets) and his brother Rūaumoko (the god of earthquakes and volcanoes), made as punishment against a tribe of patupaiarehe, supernatural beings living in the Waitākere Ranges, who used deadly magic from the earth to defeat a war party of patupaiarehe from the Hunua Ranges. In some traditions, the fire goddess Mahuika creates the volcanic field as a way to warm Mataaho, after his wife leaves and takes his clothing. Because of their close association to Mataaho, the volcanic features can be collectively referred to as Nga Maunga a Mataaho (&quot;The Mountains of Mataaho&quot;), or Ngā Huinga-a-Mataaho (&quot;the gathered volcanoes of Mataaho&quot;). Many of the volcanic features of Māngere can be referred to as Nga Tapuwae a Mataoho (&quot;The Sacred Footprints of Mataoho&quot;), including Māngere Lagoon, Waitomokia, Crater Hill, Kohuora, Pukaki Lagoon and Robertson Hill. Many of the Māori language names of volcanic features in the field refer to Mataaho by name, including Te Pane o Mataaho (Māngere Mountain), Te Tapuwae a Mataoho (Robertson Hill) and Te Kapua Kai o Mataoho (the crater of Maungawhau / Mount Eden).

=== Usage ===
Many of the &quot;maunga&quot; (mountains) were occupied by substantial Māori &quot;pā&quot; (fortifications) before Pākehā settlement, and many terraces and other archeological remnants are still visible. Many of the cones have been levelled or strongly altered, in small part due to the historical Māori use, but mostly through relatively recent quarrying of construction materials (especially scoria). However many of the remaining volcanoes are now preserved as landmarks and parks.

The warmer northern sides of the mountains were also popular among early Pākehā settlers for housing. In the 1880s, Takarunga / Mount Victoria and Maungauika / North Head were developed as military installations due to fears of a Russian invasion. The cones are also protected by a 1915 law, the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1915, which was passed due to early concern that the distinctive landscape was being eroded, especially by quarrying. While often ignored until the late 20th century, it has amongst other things minimised severe changes to Mount Roskill proposed by Transit New Zealand for the Southwestern Motorway.

In March 2007, New Zealand submitted the volcanic field, with several specifically named features, as a World Heritage Site candidate based on its unique combination of natural and cultural features. At that time, only 2 per cent of more than 800 World Heritage Sites worldwide were in this &quot;mixed&quot; category.

For most of Auckland&#x27;s post-1840 history, the mountains have been administered variously by the New Zealand Crown, the Auckland Council (or its former bodies including the Auckland City Council and Manukau City Council) or the Department of Conservation.

In the 2014 Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the Crown and the &quot;Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau&quot; collective of 13 Auckland iwi and hapū (also known as the Tāmaki Collective), ownership of the 14 &quot;Tūpuna Maunga&quot; (ancestral mountains) of &quot;Tāmaki Makaurau&quot; / Auckland, was vested to the collective. The legislation specified that the land be held in trust &quot;for the common benefit of Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau and the other people of Auckland&quot;. The &quot;Tūpuna Maunga o Tāmaki Makaurau Authority&quot; or Tūpuna Maunga Authority (TMA) is the co-governance organisation established to administer the 14 Tūpuna Maunga. Auckland Council manages the Tūpuna Maunga under the direction of the TMA.

=== Dangers ===

Since the field is not extinct, new volcanic events may occur at any time, though the usual period between events is, on average, somewhere between hundreds to thousands of years. There has been at least one eruption in every 2,500 years over the last 50,000 years. However, the effects of such an event—especially a full-scale eruption—would be substantial, ranging from pyroclastic surges to earthquakes, lava bombs, ash falls, and the venting volcanic gas, as well as lava flows. These effects might continue for several months, potentially causing substantial destruction and disruption, ranging from the burial of substantial tracts of residential or commercial property, to the mid-to-long-term closures of major parts of the country&#x27;s infrastructure such as the Port of Auckland, the State Highway network, or the Auckland Airport. It is possible that several volcanoes could erupt simultaneously. There is strong evidence that eight erupted within a span of 3000 years or so, between 31,000 and 28,000 years ago.

Most eruptive events in the field have been small volume, very constrained in time, typically involving less than of magma making its way to the surface. However the same amount of magma can have an order of magnitude different impact. An underwater eruption which is more likely to be explosive resulted in the formation of the wide Ōrākei crater that destroyed an area of by crater formation and base surge impact. This contrasts with the about diameter cone produced by the same amount of upwelling magma that might be expected to destroy an area of if there is no ground water interaction. Modelling has suggested that the next eruption in the volcanic field is likely to be associated with water and in the area extending from the central city to its north and northeast suburbs surrounding and including the Waitemata Harbour. Within New Zealand the volcanic hazard of the field is graded below that of Taupo Volcanic Zone volcano&#x27;s but is likely to be perceived by the population affected as a greater potential nuisance if it occurs.

Various operative structures, plans and systems have been set up to prepare responses to volcanic activity within the urban areas, mainly coordinated in the Auckland Volcanic Field Contingency Plan of the Auckland Regional Council, which provides a framework for interaction of civil defence and emergency services during an eruption. Auckland also has a seismic monitoring network comprising six seismometers—including one deep at Riverhead—and three repeaters within the region that will detect the small tremors likely to precede any volcanic activity. This is likely to give between a few hours and several days&#x27; warning of an impending eruption, and its approximate location.

Auckland War Memorial Museum, itself built on the crater rim of Pukekawa, has an exhibition on the field, including the &quot;Puia Street multi-sensory visitor experience&quot;, which simulates a grandstand view of an eruption in Auckland.

<text>Film studies is an academic discipline that deals with various theoretical, historical, and critical approaches to cinema as an art form and a medium. It is sometimes subsumed within media studies and is often compared to television studies.

Film studies is less concerned with advancing proficiency in film production than it is with exploring the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political implications of the cinema. In searching for these social-ideological values, film studies takes a series of critical approaches for the analysis of production, theoretical framework, context, and creation. Also, in studying film, possible careers include critic or production. Overall the study of film continues to grow, as does the industry on which it focuses.

Academic journals publishing film studies work include &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, &quot;Film Comment&quot;, &quot;Film International&quot;, &quot;CineAction&quot;, &quot;Screen&quot;, &quot;Journal of Cinema and Media Studies&quot;, &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Journal of Film and Video&quot;.

==History==

Film studies as an academic discipline emerged in the 20th century, decades after the invention of motion pictures. Rather than focusing on the technical aspects of film production, film studies are concentrated on film theory, which approaches film critically as an art, and the writing of film historiography. Because film became an invention and industry only in the late 19th century, a generation of film producers and directors existed significantly before the academic analysis that followed in later generations.

Early film schools focused on the production and subjective critique of film rather than on the critical approaches, history and theory used to study academically. The concept of film studies arose as a means of analyzing the formal aspects of film as the films were created. Established in 1919, the Moscow Film School was the first school in the world to focus on film. In the United States, the USC School of Cinematic Arts, established in 1929, was the first cinematic-based school, which was created in agreement with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It was also the first to offer an academic major in film in 1932, but the program lacked many of the distinctions associated with contemporary film study. Universities began to implement cinema-related curricula without separation of the abstract and practical approaches.

The German &quot;Deutsche Filmakademie Babelsberg&quot; was founded during the era of the Third Reich in 1938. Its lecturers included Willi Forst and Heinrich George. Students were required to create films in order to complete their studies at the academy.

A movement away from Hollywood productions in the 1950s turned cinema into a more artistic independent endeavor. It was the creation of the auteur theory, which examines film as the director&#x27;s vision and art, that broadened the scope of academic film studies to a worldwide presence in the 1960s. In 1965, film critic Robin Wood, in his writings on Alfred Hitchcock, declared that Hitchcock&#x27;s films contained the same complexities of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Similarly, French director Jean Luc Godard, a contributor to the influential magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, wrote: &quot;Jerry Lewis [...] is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn&#x27;t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. [...] Lewis is the only one today who&#x27;s making courageous films.&quot;

A catalyst in the success and stature of academic film studies has been large donations to universities by successful commercial filmmakers. For example, director George Lucas donated $175 million to the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 2006.

== Modern film studies ==
Today, film studies are taught worldwide and has grown to encompass numerous methods for teaching history, culture and society. Many liberal arts colleges and universities, as well as American high schools, contain courses specifically focused on the analysis of film. Modern-day film studies increasingly reflect popular culture and art, and a wide variety of curricula have emerged for analysis of critical approaches used in film. Students are typically expected to form the ability to detect conceptual shifts in film, a vocabulary for the analysis of film form and style, a sense of ideological dimensions of film and an awareness of extra textual domains and possible direction of film in the future. Universities often allow students to participate in film research and attend seminars of specialized topics to enhance their critical abilities.

===Common curriculum===

The curriculum of tertiary-level film studies programs often include but are not limited to:
* Introduction to film studies
* Modes of film studies
* Close analysis of film
* History of film/media
* Analysis with emphasis
# Attention to time period
# Attention to regional creation
# Attention to genre
# Attention to creators
* Methods of film production
===American film studies===
A total of 144 tertiary institutions in the United States offer a major program in film studies. This number continues to grow each year with new interest in film studies. Institutions offering film degrees as part of their arts or communications curricula differ from institutions with dedicated film programs.

The success of the American film industry has contributed to the popularity of academic film studies in the U.S., and film-related degrees often enable graduates to pursue careers in the production of film, especially directing and producing films. Courses often combine alternate media, such as television or new media, in combination with film studies.

===Worldwide film studies===
Film-studies programs at all levels are offered worldwide, primarily in the countries in the Global North. In many cases, film studies can be found in departments of media studies or communication studies. Film archives and museums such as the Eye Filmmuseum in Amsterdam also conduct scholarly projects alongside educational and outreach programs. 

Film festivals play an important role in the study of film and may include discourses on topics such as film style, aesthetics, representation, production, distribution, social impact, history, archival and curation. Major festivals such as the Cannes Film Festival offer extensive programs with talks and panel discussions. They also inform film historiography, most actively through retrospectives and historical sections such as Cannes Classics.

Film festival FESPACO serves as a major hub for discourse on cinema on the African continent.

<text>Balassagyarmat (Hungarian: ; formerly &quot;Balassa-Gyarmath&quot;; ; or ) is a town in northern Hungary. 

It was the seat of the Nógrád comitatus. Balassagyarmat is the capital city of [[Palóc]] country as the prominent author of Hungarian epic, Kálmán Mikszáth said. Palóc people&#x27;s origin is quite mysterious. Their distinctive dialect, culture, folklore, and traditions make them a unique ethnicity.

== History ==

Since 1998, the town&#x27;s coat of arms has borne the Latin inscription &quot;Civitas Fortissima&quot; (the bravest city) because it was claimed that in January 1919 Czechoslovak troops crossed the demarcation line delineated in December 1918 in preparation for the Treaty of Trianon, illegally occupying towns south of the line, including Balassagyarmat. The occupation was the subject of a 2009 song by the nationalist rock-band Kárpátia, &quot;Civitas Fortissima&quot;.

Due to its favorable location, Balassagyarmat has been populated since the Bronze Age. When the Magyar tribes entered the Carpathian Basin, Grand Chief Árpád sent his two generals, Zoárd and Kadosa to take the northern parts of Hungary. After the occupation of Nógrád Castle, Zoárd and Kadosa took control over the Balassagyarmat region. The name of the town derives from the name of Gyarmat, which was one of the seven Magyar tribes who came with Árpád. The Gyarmat tribe settled in the Balassagyarmat region. 

In 1241, the Mongols invaded the country, destroying the settlement completely. After the Mongols withdrew the following year, stone castles were built all over the country at the urging of King Bela IV. He was anticipating a second Mongol invasion, and he expected to stop them with the help of stone castles.

The first medieval castle of Balassagyarmat developed from a watchtower established after the Mongolian invasion. At this time, it was called just Gyarmat. We know that it was the king&#x27;s property, and it used to belong to Hont castle in 1244. King Béla IV gave these estates to Miklós, son of Detre of the Kacsics Clan in 1246. Detre became the ancestor of the Balassa family. In the same document, the king ordered the construction of a castle in Gyarmat, which was completed around 1260. It was how Detre, the ancestor of the Balassa family, built the first fortified stone tower in Gyarmat along the Ipoly River. The construction was certainly ready in 1274, as it was mentioned in a contemporary charter.

Later Péter (aka Furró), one of the members of the Balassa family was accused of infidelity, so King László IV took the castle from him. However, the new owner, Comes Demeter of Pozsony and Zólyom Counties could not take the property as the previous owner did not cede it. We came to know about this incident as it was mentioned in a document in 1290, according to which Demeter had to take the residential tower of Gyarmat by force. As it was, Demeter was also related to the Balassa family, so the property remained in their hands. They did not let it slip from their hands. In 1374, the Balassa family received a new letter of donation from King Lajos the Great so the town remained the property of the family. The only change was that the castle was in the hands of the king, who usually appointed the members of the Balassa family as his castellans. The settlement developed into a market town by the 15th century, but despite its closely integrated castle, it had no military significance. Officially speaking, Balassagyarmat became a market town in 1437.

The situation changed radically after the battle of Mohács in 1526. The importance of the castles of Nógrád County, including Gyarmat castle, had been increased. The northern part of the fortification was defended by the Ipoly River, but the other defences were hastily fortified, and the city was surrounded by a wooden palisade.

The Ottoman Turks were expanding their rule unstoppably to the north, and in 1541 they took Buda as well. In 1544, 500 soldiers were guarding Gyarmat castle, under the command of Horváth Bertalan. (Please note that I use the Oriental name order for Hungarians, where family names come first.)

The enemy took the nearby Szanda castle and destroyed it in 1551. Captain Horváth heard of the approaching Turks in 1552 and fled from the castle, leaving it empty. It was how Pasha Hadim Ali of Buda castle took it without a fight. He set it on fire and demolished it at once. The castle was recaptured by the royal troops only in the 1593 campaign of Chief Captain Kristóf Tiefenbach of Kassa (Košice, Kaschau) who was aided by the troops of Pálffy Miklós and Homonnay István. They could easily take the small castle as the Turk garrison set it on fire and fled when the Christian army was coming. Colonel Philip Morgentaller was appointed as captain of the castle, and immediately began repairing and restoring the damaged walls. Let us also commemorate Balassi Bálint, the great Renaissance poet and warrior who lost his life at the siege of Esztergom in 1594. 

Below is a commemorative plaque to Bálint Balassi (1554–1594) Hungarian poet and warrior. It was affixed to the wall of the high school which bears his name. Quote: &quot;The beautiful confines of your homeland are truncated everywhere.&quot; (Balassagyarmat, Deák Ferenc Street Nr 17)

The Imperial guards of Gyarmat opened the gates of the castle before General Rhédey Ferenc, the commander of Prince Bocskai István of Transylvania in 1605. Nevertheless, the castle was returned to King Rudolf in 1606, according to the Treaty of Vienna in 1606. The Diets held in 1608, 1613, and 1618 ordered to reinforce the castle which was carried out. Despite these fortifications, the castle was occupied by Prince Bethlen Gábor&#x27;s army in 1619, but according to the peace of Nikolsburg in 1622, it was given back to the Habsburg king.

Balassagyarmat was besieged by the Turks in 1648 with an army of 4,000 men, but the cavalry of Count Ádám Forgách, the Chief Captain of Érsekújvár (Nové Zámky) castle came to the aid of the defenders, and he chased the attackers away. In 1652, Count Esterházy Ferenc was the captain of the castle, the one who fell in the battle of Vezekény. After 1652, Balassa Ferenc and his brother Imre became the chief captains of the castle. However, Imre demanded a bigger share from the leadership and the estate, causing a quarrel between them.

The Turks were able to benefit from their debate, though. The Ottoman Empire seemed to be declining but an iron-handed Grand Vizier called Köprülü Ahmed wanted to prevent this process. He launched a huge army against Hungary in 1663, his troops occupied, burned, and destroyed the smaller border castles that lay in their path.
Taking advantage of the quarrel between the Balassi brothers, the Turkish army led by Köprülü – joined by the army of Prince Apafi Mihály of Transylvania – occupied Balassagyarmat. They burned and thoroughly destroyed the castle in 1663 or 1665.

As it had lost its military significance, the ruined walls were not rebuilt again. During the Ottoman Wars, the area and the city became depopulated. After the end of the war, the settlement started to develop again, and it was rebuilt in 1690. Due to its favourable geographical location, the town was rapidly populated. In 1701, the fortifications of the town were blown up, according to the decree of Emperor Leopold. Later, the stones of the fortress were used for construction, so today there is hardly any trace of it above the surface. 

During World War II, May 9, 1944, Germans kept 3,000 Jews from the town and the surrounding villages imprisoned in a ghetto. They were all sent to Auschwitz concentration camp on June 11 and 14, 1944.

Balassagyarmat was captured on 9 December 1944 by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Budapest Offensive.

In 1973, two young men (17 and 19), the sons of the local secretary of the state-party, broke into the city&#x27;s girls&#x27; dormitory and took hostage 20 girls. They demanded a bus to cross the border into Austria. They stayed there for five days without any food or drink before being taken down. The older brother was shot by three snipers with special bullets on the fifth day from outside the building. The younger brother was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison, and his four friends, who had heard about their plans before they committed the crime, were sentenced to four years each in prison. None of the girls was injured physically except one, who broke her arm when she tried to escape by jumping out of the window of the dormitory on the second day. Afterwards, they were instructed not to publicly talk about the case. Csenge Hatala, a young writer, started collecting documents and conducting interviews with the victims forty years later.

This was the first hostage situation in the modern history of Hungary. The unqualified police and military force found themselves in a situation they had no experience of. In communist Hungary, serious crimes were not only awkward, but actually harmful to the Party and its leaders. The city authorities tried to hide the details and smother the case, but it triggered a huge wave of indignation in the city and throughout the country as a whole.

<text>Avenue C is a north-south avenue located in the Alphabet City area of the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, east of Avenue B and west of Avenue D. It is also known as Loisaida Avenue. It starts at South Street, proceeding north as Montgomery Street and Pitt Street, before intersecting East Houston Street and assuming its proper name. Avenue C ends at 23rd Street, running nearly underneath the FDR Drive from 18th Street. North of 14th Street, the road forms the eastern boundary of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.

==History and description==
The street was created by the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, as one of 16 north-south streets specified as in width; they include 12 numbered avenues, and four (located east of First Avenue) designated by letter.

Avenue C was designated Loisaida Avenue in 1987, in recognition of the Puerto Rican heritage of the neighborhood. Loisaida is Spanglish and is pronounced (Lower East Side). The history of the neighborhood was described in the book &quot;Selling The Lower East Side&quot;. Although the East Village designation of this area has received widespread acceptance, many longtime Loisaida residents still consider it part of the Lower East Side, as evidenced by the public art found on the buildings along Avenue C.

A bicycle lane has existed on the avenue since 1999. It is now a buffered lane for the majority of its route and has been extended to nearly the full length of the avenue.

Avenue C was converted into a two-way boulevard between 18th Street and 23rd Street as part of the development of Stuyvesant Cove Park, which opened in 2002 and resulted in the shifting of the northbound service road of the FDR Drive from the east side to the west side of the elevated viaduct.

On October 29th and 30th, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damages including this street in specific of many that were flooded out during the storm. 

==Landmarks==

The Public National Bank Building at 106 Avenue C at the corner of East 7th Street (also known as 231 East 7th Street) was built in 1923 as a branch bank, and was designed by Eugene Schoen, a noted advocate of modernism at the time. The Public National Bank was a New York State-based bank, and Schoen designed a number of branches for them. This building was sold in 1954, and turned into a nursing home with the addition of a third story. It was converted to residential use in the 1980s.

At the corner of Loisaida and 9th Street, there are two sizable (by Manhattan standards) community gardens that are maintained by the surrounding community. Their hours vary with the season and ability of their volunteers, but they are open to everyone and there is no admission fee. The famous punk house C-Squat sits at another corner of 9th Street. The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space, which opened in 2012, is located at C-Squat.

==Transportation==
The M9 travels on Avenue C from Houston to 23rd Streets. The M14D SBS and the M23 SBS New York City Bus routes also travel on the avenue for short stretches.

<text>Zéro Musique (or Zero Music in English) is a Canadian record label founded in 1993, by four equal partners: musician Luc De Larochellière; two brothers, comedic musician François Pérusse, and audio producer Marc Pérusse; and their manager Pierre Dumont. Headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Zéro Musique was formed following Luc De Larochellière and François Pérusse&#x27;s split from Les Disques Trafic when the major record label was having financial and corporate instability (Trafic eventually shut down later in 1993). Instead of looking for a new record label, they opted to start their own independent imprint and immediately secured a financing and distribution deal through MCA Records Canada. Zéro Musique was legally filled as a subsidiary of Pierre Dumont&#x27;s music publishing company, Del Monte Musique Inc., and became associated with Marc Pérusse&#x27;s recording studio, Studio Le Divan Vert.

In September 1995, the partners formed the sub-label Sub-Zero Records, intended to release Anglophone bands, the first of which was Likwid. Also in 1995, Zéro Musique started signing other Francophone artists through its main company, including Annette Campagne (whom François Pérusse was dating) and Martine Mai. Albums were also planned for TSPC (in 1998 with an album that was never finished) and Coral Egan (in 1999 which yielded an album produced by Marc Pérusse that never released). In mid-1997, MCA Records Canada was renamed Universal Music Canada and Zéro Musique signed a new partnership contract. To this day, Zéro Musique continues to distribute its releases through Universal Music Canada. Luc De Larochellière and Marc Pérusse left the partnership in 1999 and the record label was restructured in 2000; all of the bands were dropped and the company exclusively released François Pérusse&#x27;s music from 2000 to 2012. Because of this, people often perceive Zéro Musique as François Pérusse&#x27;s personal record label, not knowing the first seven years of the company&#x27;s history.

In the summer of 2012 Zéro Musique expanded to managing other comedian artists and signed Alexandre Barrette (2012–present), Pierre-Luc Gosselin and Nicholas Savard-L&#x27;Herbier (as Les Satiriques) (2012–2018), Korine Côté (2012–present), Etienne Dano (2012), Simon Delisle (2012–2015), François Boulianne (2013–2015), Marie-Lyne Joncas (2015), Joe Guérin (2015–2017), Philippe-Audrey Larrue-St-Jacques (2015–present) and Alexandre Bouchard (2015–2017).

<text>Villa Maria is a subsidized private Catholic co-educational high school in Montreal, Quebec, Canada that offers both a francophone and an anglophone stream. Founded in 1854 as a boarding school for girls, it stopped boarding students in 1966 and opened, in August 2016, to boys in the seventh grade. Today, there are roughly 950 students in the French sector and 800 students in the English sector with an average class size of 34 students. Current tuition as of the 2021–2022 school year is $4,500 with $1,900 in extra mandatory fees.

The central part of the Villa Maria school is known as the Monklands Mansion and was the home of the governor general of Canada from 1844 to 1849. It is a National Historic Site of Canada. In 2023, the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal announced that the estate on which the school lies will be sold off, leaving the future of the school uncertain.

==Monklands==
In 1795, James Monk, Chief Justice of Lower Canada, purchased an estate in Montreal that had previously belonged to the Décarie family. The first Monk residence, built in 1803, was the central section of the present-day Villa Maria.

Sir James Monk willed the property known as ‘Monklands’ to his niece, Elizabeth Ann Monk. In 1844, the family leased Monklands to the Crown as a residence for the Governor General of Canada. Modifications were made to create a more imposing residence.

Three Governors General—Sir Charles Metcalfe, Lord Cathcart, and Lord Elgin—resided at Monklands. When Elgin occupied the house, British extremists threatened to burn the structure down after Elgin signed a bill that helped those of the French whose homes had been burnt down during British raids by granting them money to reestablish themselves. However, because Lady Elgin was pregnant at the time, the rebels decided to burn down the parliament building in Montreal, instead. Soon, Lady Elgin gave birth to a son, Victor Bruce, the future Viceroy of India, in a second floor room. While Montreal was serving as the capital of the Province of Canada (1844-49), Sebastien Compain turned Monklands into a country hotel.

Monklands is one of the oldest remaining Palladian-style villas in Canada. Because of its excellent state of conservation and the historic importance of its various occupants, it was declared a National Historic Site in 1951.

==School==
During the 1840s, the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal&#x27;s teaching order faced overcrowded classrooms and began searching for a new place. The third phase of the building’s history thus began when the Congregation purchased the estate to open a boarding school. While Compain&#x27;s business venture proved profitable, he agreed to give it up. Negotiations with the Monk family went smoothly. The Congregation decided to call their new school Villa Maria. It opened in 1854. By the end of September that year, enrollment reached 45 girls. Of these, all were boarders, and 18 came from outside of Montreal, including Boston. While the ratio of anglophone to francophone students have changed over the years, both cultural groups have remained honoured. At that time in history, Villa Maria was a leader in education in Montreal, and was visited by a number of dignitaries, starting with the future King Edward VII in 1860.

The school stopped boarding students in 1966 and now is a co-educational high school for children in Montreal and surrounding areas aged 12 to 17 (or Levels 1 to 5 according to Quebec Education levels, the equivalent of Grades 7 to 11). Between 2016 and 2020, the integration of boys was gradual, with current girls-only classes staying girls-only. This change was speculated to be a means of boosting enrollment, due to decreased numbers of eligible students entering the anglophone stream. 

The Villa-Maria metro station is named after the school.

== Notable students ==
* Pauline Fréchette (1889–1943; graduated, 1908), poet, dramatist, journalist, nun
* Veronica Lake, American actress
* Maybelle Stephens Mitchell, American suffragist
* Jessica Paré, actress
* Anna T. Sadlier (1854–1932), writer

<text>Earth Abides is a 1949 American post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by George R. Stewart. The novel tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and the emergence of a new culture with simpler tools. Set in the 1940s in Berkeley, California, the story is told by Isherwood Williams, who emerges from isolation in the mountains to find almost everyone dead.

&quot;Earth Abides&quot; won the inaugural International Fantasy Award in 1951. It was included in &quot;Locus&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of best All Time Science Fiction in 1987 and 1998 and was a nominee to be entered into the Prometheus Hall of Fame some time before 2002.

==Plot==

===&quot;Part I: World Without End&quot;===
While working on his graduate thesis in geography in the Sierra Nevada, Ish is bitten by a rattlesnake. As he heals from the bite in a cabin, he gets sick with a disease similar to measles, and he lapses in and out of consciousness. He eventually recovers and makes his way back to civilization, only to discover that it has collapsed after most people have died from the same disease. He decides to go to his home in Berkeley, California. In the city near his home Ish meets a few survivors and also encounters a friendly and eager dog, which he names Princess, who swiftly adopts Ish as her new master. He sets out on a cross-country tour, traveling all the way to New York City and back, scavenging for food and fuel as he goes. As he travels, he finds small groups of survivors, but has doubts about humanity&#x27;s ability to survive the loss of civilization.

Ish returns to his home in California. After reading Ecclesiastes, he realizes that he had been throwing his life away. He finds a woman, Emma, living nearby and they agree to consider themselves married and have children. They are gradually joined by other survivors. Over time the electricity (which had been provided by automated hydro power station) fails and the comforts of civilization recede. As the children grow, Ish tries to instill basic academics by teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography, but he is largely unsuccessful due to a lack of interest by the others.

Many children are born in these years, including Joey, Ish&#x27;s youngest and favorite son. Joey is very similar in nature to Ish, as he demonstrates innate intelligence and a curiosity about the world before the epidemic. This leads Ish to believe that Joey is the key to the future.

===&quot;Part II: The Year 22&quot;===

Twenty-two years later, the community is flourishing, with the young adapting easily to the de-modernised world. They come to have a better grasp of the natural world than the adults, and when running water fails, the younger generation comes to the rescue, knowing where flowing streams may be found. Ish turns his attention from ecology to his newly forming society, and he notices that the children are becoming very superstitious. One day Ish asks for his hammer which he habitually carries around, and finds the children are afraid to touch it as it is a symbol to them of the old times; the long-dead &quot;Americans&quot; of the old world are now viewed like gods, including Ish.

The older boys return from a cross country trip with a stranger named Charlie, who exposes the tribe to typhoid fever which kills many, including Joey. Through his despair, Ish is forced to face the future with a different set of expectations and hopes. His ambition to restore civilization to its original state is replaced by a more modest, practical one to simply convey a few basic survival skills, such as making bows and arrows, which the children think are great playthings.

As the years go by, the community begins to grow corn. Ish presides at meetings, his hammer being a symbol of his status. Though he is respected, many of his ideas are ignored by the younger men.

===&quot;Part III: The Last American&quot;===

Ish spends most of his elderly life in a mental &quot;fog&quot;, unaware of the world. Occasionally the fog in his mind lifts. During one such time, he finds himself aware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him. Jack tells him that the bow and arrow have become more reliable than the gun, whose cartridges do not always work. Jack also mentions that the differently colored arrowheads that he has made, unbeknownst to him, from several coin denominations are suitable for hunting different game. Ish finds this belief superstitious, but decides it would be futile to challenge it. Ish realizes that the former civilization is now completely gone and will not be rebuilt anytime soon. He becomes reconciled to the way things have changed. When Ish is dying, the younger men insist that his hammer be passed on. Ish chooses Jack.

==Characters==
&quot;Isherwood Williams&quot; (Ish) is a graduate student at Berkeley, studying the geography of an area in the mountains, somewhere in California. He is sometimes referred to in the book as &quot;The Last American.&quot; Ish becomes the leader of the community, aka &quot;the tribe&quot;, he believes due to his intellect.

&quot;Emma&quot; (Em) is a woman who Isherwood meets in his hometown. The author may have been taking a chance with this character, who is, at least partially, African-American, while Isherwood is white; when the book was written, interracial marriages were heavily discouraged in American society. Isherwood does marry her, and race isn&#x27;t important to the couple&#x27;s relationship. Em becomes the community&#x27;s mother, letting it grow as it will, but stepping in to help when no one else is filling the leadership role. She is the adult while others panic, and Ish thinks of her as the &quot;Mother of Nations&quot;. In her old age, she disagrees with Ish about a request by a smaller community, known as the Others, to join the Tribe. Ish initially opposes the idea, but Em supports it, and Ish changes his mind.

&quot;Ezra&quot; meets Emma and Ish while traveling through Berkeley, he was a former liquor salesman and immigrant from Yorkshire, England. They liked him, but feared the complications of a love triangle, so they encouraged him to leave. He returned with Molly and Jean, his wives. Ish values Ezra as a good judge of people, saying &quot;Ezra knew people, Ezra liked people.&quot;

&quot;George&quot; is a carpenter by trade. George is not intellectually intelligent but becomes a Jack-of-all-trades able to build, repair or maintain the limited infrastructure of the small community.

&quot;Evie&quot; is a &quot;half grown girl&quot; who Ezra found living &quot;in squalor and solitude.&quot; She appears to have a mental illness, and the others all care and provide for her. Evie grows into an attractive young woman but the tribe has a rule, that as the children grow no one will marry her—she wouldn&#x27;t understand, and her mental condition could possibly be hereditary.

&quot;Joey&quot; is the youngest son of Ish and Em. Of all the children in the Tribe, he is the only one that truly understands the academic skills that Ish tries to teach — geometry, reading, geography. He dies during the typhoid fever outbreak.

&quot;Charlie&quot; is a stranger who arrives from Los Angeles after two of the &quot;boys&quot; (the second generation) make a scouting expedition in a refurbished Jeep to see what is left of America. Immediately upon his arrival Ish and Ezra become suspicious about Charlie and the type of person he might be. Their suspicions are confirmed a day later when Charlie sets his eye on Evie. He also reveals to Ezra after drinking heavily that he has had many of &quot;Cupid&#x27;s&quot; diseases. Ish confronts Charlie about Evie, Charlie is disrespectful and challenges Ish&#x27;s authority as leader. It is revealed that Charlie carries a concealed pistol and his behavior reveals himself as someone who was probably a violent criminal before the epidemic. As a result, Ish, Em, Ezra and George debate what to do about Charlie for the safety of the community, exile or execution. Charlie is the carrier of the typhoid epidemic that infects the community.

&quot;Jack&quot; is Ish&#x27;s great-grandson. He&#x27;s a young man who hunts with arrows he makes himself. Jack is confident, intelligent and a potential leader, and Ish sees something of Joey in him; although he has beliefs which to Ish seem superstitious and naive. Like others of his generation, Jack believes Ish&#x27;s old hammer is something very important for the Tribe. He risks his life by going into a burning house to retrieve the hammer. A little later, as Ish is dying, the young men want to know who the hammer will now belong to, and Ish chooses Jack.

==Major themes==

===Biological controls on population===
On the title page, Stewart immediately starts with the theme, quoting Ecclesiastes 1:4 — &quot;Men go and come, but earth abides.&quot; For the first half of &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, George R. Stewart concentrates on a major theme for the book, that humans have no privileged place in nature and are not immune to nature&#x27;s built-in population controls. The main character, a geographer, states it plainly, &quot;When anything gets too numerous it&#x27;s likely to get hit by some plague&quot;.

On the first page, Stewart tells readers how contagion could bring the end very quickly for mankind:

Within a few pages, he makes it clear that basic biology also applies to humans:

===Effects of smaller population===
Reviewer Noel Perrin has pointed out that George R. Stewart had written two books before this, in which the main character was not a person, but &quot;a natural force.&quot; In &quot;Storm&quot; the main character is weather, and in &quot;Fire&quot;, a forest fire takes center stage.

In the same way, Stewart centers the first half of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; on the forces of natural and artificial selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.

Another theme of the book is what happens to human skills as the population decreases. Reviewer Lionel Shriver points out this theme in an article about literature which features human extinction:

Stewart uses the second half of his book to show that, if humans are reduced to low numbers, it will be difficult for them to continue civilization as we know it. Reading becomes a casualty.

If skills and customs don&#x27;t work in the new situation, these die out, or those holding them do. Children adapt naturally to the new situation, and immediately useful customs and skills are more interesting to them than reading and writing. The information in libraries is useless within a generation.

One custom that Stewart predicts could die out is racism. When there are fewer partners to choose from, mankind will not be able to afford to be too choosy in picking one&#x27;s partner.

Another issue he brings up is how law and order will function, when the lawmakers, courts and enforcers are all gone. Even laws won&#x27;t be immune to the pressure to survive. One of the characters in the book point out, &quot;What laws?&quot; when they have to determine the fate of an outsider. Stewart shows how people may come to worry about potential harm rather than justice when dealing with outsiders.

===Biblical theme: replenishing the Earth===
A 1949 book review says that &quot;Earth Abides&quot; parallels two biblical stories that shows mankind spreading out and populating the world:

According to one reviewer, there is another tale of the fall of civilization that George R. Stewart could have taken account of, the story of Ishi, believed, at the time Stewart was writing, to be the last of his tribe, who lived at Berkeley, where Stewart later taught.
&quot;Ish&quot; is very similar to &quot;Ishi&quot;, and it also means &quot;man&quot;, in the language of a man whose whole tribe was dead. Ishi&#x27;s story parallels the &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;Earth Abides&quot; stories, telling of one who has to adapt to a changed world.

==Genre and style==

&quot;Earth Abides&quot; belongs to the subgenre of apocalyptic science fiction featuring a universal plague that nearly wipes out humanity. Other examples include Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1826), Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot; (1912), Michael Crichton&#x27;s &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1969), and Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot; (1978).

&quot;Earth Abides&quot; also fits into the &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; subgenre. It was published in 1949, four years after the end of World War II and in the earliest stages of the Cold War. It predates many similar novels including &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; (1959), &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Last Ship&quot; (1988). It is itself predated, however by &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; (1909) and René Barjavel&#x27;s &quot;Ashes, Ashes&quot; (&quot;Ravage&quot;, 1943), among others.

As one reviewer notes, &quot;there are no mutants, no warring tribes. I think the most refreshing aspect of this classic novel is just how human an approach Stewart applied to this story.&quot;

==Reception==

According to WorldCat.org, there have been 28 editions of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; published in English. The book has been in print in every decade from 1949 to 2008.

James Sallis, writing in 2003 in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;:
&quot;Astounding&quot; reviewer P. Schuyler Miller identified the novel as one of the first regarding &quot;a young and little understood science, the science of ecology.&quot; Miller praised Stewart for &quot;the intricacy of detail with which he has worked out his problem in ecology&quot; and for writing &quot;quietly, with very few peaks of melodrama as seem necessary in much popular fiction.&quot;

It was mentioned in a serious overview of modern science fiction, &quot;Contemporary Science Fiction&quot; by August Derleth, in the January 1952 edition of &quot;College English&quot;. Derleth called it an &quot;excellent example&quot; of the &quot;utopian theme&quot; of &quot;rebuilding after a holocaust leaving but few survivors.&quot;

It was described as a persuasive answer to the question, &quot;What is man,&quot; in the October, 1973 edition of &quot;Current Anthropology&quot;. The article &quot;Anthropology and Science Fiction&quot; examines the nature of Science Fiction and its relationship to understanding people. The magazine concluded of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; that it shows ...&quot;man is man, be he civilized or tribal. Stewart shows us that a tribal hunting culture is just as valid and real to its members as civilization is to us.&quot;

In the &quot;American Quarter&quot; article &quot;California&#x27;s Literary Regionalism&quot;, Autumn 1955, George R. Stewart is seen as a &quot;humanist in the old classical sense. His novels, &quot;Storm&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;East of the Giants&quot;, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, demonstrate the complex interlocking of topography, climate, and human society; and their general tone is objective and optimistic.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
In November 1950, the book was adapted for the CBS radio program &quot;Escape&quot; as a two-part drama starring John Dehner. A television adaptation was released by Amazon MGM Studios in December 2024.

==References to other works==
The book makes a reference to &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. Ish compares the situations within these books to what he is going through. He finds Robinson Crusoe less appealing, because &quot;his religious preoccupations seemed boring and rather silly&quot;. He looks at the ship in &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; as an &quot;infinite grab-bag from which at any time they might take exactly what they wanted,&quot; which is similar to the situation of those living after the Great Disaster.

Stewart also mentions Ecclesiastes 1:4 in the title and theme: &quot;Men go and come, but Earth abides&quot;.

==Legacy and homages==
* Stephen King has stated that &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was an inspiration for his post-apocalyptic novel &quot;The Stand&quot;.
* Composer Philip Aaberg wrote a piece of music, titled &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, inspired by the novel. The piece was originally written as part of a sound track commissioned by the National Geographic Society for a documentary on the Earth. The track can be found on the Windham Hill CD &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Solstice III&quot; (track 15).
* Jimi Hendrix claimed that &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was his favorite book and his song &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; is inspired by the novel.

<text>Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer is a science fiction post-apocalypse-survival novel by American writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle that was first published in 1977. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1978. Two issues of a planned six-part comic book adaptation were published by Innovation Comics in 1993.

== Plot summary ==
When wealthy amateur astronomer Tim Hamner co-discovers a new comet, named Hamner-Brown for its discoverers, documentary producer Harvey Randall persuades Hamner to have his soap company sponsor a television documentary series on the comet. Political lobbying by California Senator Arthur Jellison eventually gets a joint Apollo-Soyuz (docking with Skylab B) mission approved to study the comet, dubbed &quot;The Hammer&quot; by the media, which is expected to pass close to the Earth.

The scientific community assures the public that a collision with Earth is extremely unlikely, but the comet&#x27;s nucleus breaks apart and the pieces strike parts of Europe, Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. These result in volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis, destroying major coastal cities around the world, killing billions and initiating a new ice age because of the massive quantities of water and debris flung into the atmosphere.

Immediately after the strike, China, anticipating that the Soviet Union will become too cold for its people and must therefore invade its neighbor, launches a preemptive nuclear attack on its neighbor. The Soviets retaliate with their own nuclear missiles, reassuring the US that it is not the target.

Jellison has taken discreet precautions and moved his people and supplies to his ranch. He takes charge and organizes the easily protected valley in the Sierra foothills where his ranch is located, dubbed the &quot;Stronghold&quot;. Randall and Hamner separately reach the valley and are allowed in (unlike almost all other refugees). Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist and resident genius Dan Forrester receives a warm welcome when he reveals that he has hidden a cache of invaluable &quot;how-to&quot; books.

Other groups organize as well. The remnants of a United States Army unit, commanded by Sergeant Hooker, resorts to cannibalism to survive. They are joined by a criminal gang led by Alim Nassor. Together they search in vain for a place that is not too heavily defended, but capable of supporting them all. Reverend Henry Armitage, driven mad by the catastrophe, shows up and absolves the &quot;New Brotherhood Army&quot; of their crimes and cannibalism, stating that they have a mission from God to return humanity to a simpler, non-technological way of life. Their expansion is blocked by the Stronghold, which is also their only serious rival in numbers and strength. They attack, but Jellison&#x27;s outnumbered forces defeat them with the help of mustard gas and other weapons produced by Forrester. 

An operational nuclear power plant nearby is also a target of the New Brotherhood. The defenders barely survive the first assault and plead for help. Jellison&#x27;s people are reluctant to send it, as the greatly weakened New Brotherhood no longer poses a threat to the Stronghold, but astronaut Rick Delanty gives them a stark choice: remain safe, though their descendants will be peasants, or attack and wipe out the New Brotherhood, and use the electric power to rebuild civilization. Just then, Jellison dies, but not before the ailing old man casts the deciding vote for the latter. They succeed, and later, it is shown that they are well on the way back to restoring civilization.

== Literary significance and reception ==
Niven and Pournelle originally pitched the story to publishers as an alien invasion story in which the aliens drop a comet onto Earth after humanity fights them. Jim Baen told them to write only the comet story. The original story idea was later written as their novel &quot;Footfall&quot;.

At least one reference to prior work by the authors is present in the text, through &quot;Crazy Eddie&#x27;s Insurance&quot;, a direct reference to &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; (published in 1974).

Judith T. Yamamoto, in her review for the &quot;Library Journal&quot;, said that the novel was full of &quot;good, solid science, a gigantic but well developed and coordinated cast of characters, and about a megaton of suspenseful excitement&quot;. Her one negative comment was that the pro-technology pitch might turn off some readers but &quot;all in all it&#x27;s a good book, if not a great one&quot;. &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; received a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1978.

C. Ben Ostrander reviewed &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 13. Ostrander commented that &quot;I recommend this book... Don&#x27;t miss it for a long, interesting story&quot;.

<text>Neu! (; German for &quot;New!&quot;; styled in block capitals) were a West German krautrock band formed in Düsseldorf in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother following their departure from Kraftwerk. The group&#x27;s albums were produced by Conny Plank, who has been regarded as the group&#x27;s &quot;hidden member&quot;. They released three albums in their initial incarnation—&quot;Neu!&quot; (1972), &quot;Neu! 2&quot; (1973), and &quot;Neu! 75&quot; (1975)—before disbanding in 1975. They briefly reunited in the mid-1980s.

Although Neu! had minimal commercial success during their existence, the band are retrospectively considered a central act of West Germany&#x27;s 1970s krautrock movement. They are known for pioneering the &quot;motorik&quot; beat, a minimalist  rhythm associated with krautrock artists. Their work has exerted a widespread influence on genres such as electronica and punk.

==History==

===1970–1971: Pre-formation===
Neu! was formed in 1971 in Düsseldorf as an offshoot from an early line-up of another seminal krautrock band, Kraftwerk, whose early works were also produced by Conny Plank. Drummer Klaus Dinger had joined Kraftwerk midway through sessions for their eponymous debut album. Guitarist Michael Rother was then recruited to the Kraftwerk line-up on completion of the album. (Rother had been playing in a local band called The Spirits of Sound, the line-up of which also included drummer Wolfgang Flür, who would himself go on to join Kraftwerk two years later.)

Kraftwerk co-founder Ralf Hütter left the band at this point to complete his studies and, for six months, Kraftwerk consisted of a trio of Rother, Dinger and Florian Schneider. This line-up played sporadic gigs and made a live appearance on German television programme &quot;Beat Club&quot;. Recording sessions at Conny Plank&#x27;s Windrose studio were unsuccessful (Rother later attributed the failure to &quot;a difference of temperament&quot;). Dinger and Rother parted company from Schneider and began Neu! with Plank. Hütter rejoined Schneider and the pair continued recording the second Kraftwerk album with Plank.

===1971–1975: Main career===
The band name NEU! (&quot;new!&quot;) was inspired by the prevalence of the advertising business in Düsseldorf at the time, according to Dinger, who described it as &quot;the strongest word in advertising&quot; and even owned a pro forma advertising agency himself for the purpose of booking studios. The band&#x27;s eponymous first album sold just 30,000 records, yet is today considered a masterpiece by many, including influential artists such as David Bowie, Brian Eno, Iggy Pop and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. It included the Motorik benchmark tracks &quot;Hallogallo&quot; and &quot;Negativland&quot; (the band Negativland took their name from this track), and bizarre &quot;songs&quot; like &quot;Sonderangebot&quot;.

Their second album, &quot;Neu! 2&quot;, features some of the earliest examples of musical remixes. The duo, excited about recording another album, decided to expand their horizons by purchasing several new instruments. With the money they had left as an advance from the record company, they could record only half an album&#x27;s worth of material. The company would not increase their advance because the first album did not sell well enough and the label did not see a reason to further finance what was most likely to become a flop. To rectify the lack of material, the band filled the second side with manipulated versions of their already-released single &quot;Neuschnee&quot;/&quot;Super&quot;, playing back each song at different speeds and sometimes warbling the music by messing with the tape machine or placing the record off center on the turntable. The songs &quot;Super 16&quot; and &quot;Super 78&quot; (slowed down and sped up versions of the proto-punk song &quot;Super,&quot; respectively) unwittingly became the theme songs to the 1976 martial arts cult classic &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot; by Jimmy Wang Yu. This film was later referenced by Quentin Tarantino in &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; by also featuring the track &quot;Super 16&quot;.

Dinger and Rother were both very different when left to their own devices, and this led to their final album of the 1970s, &quot;Neu! &#x27;75&quot; being two solo half-albums. Side One was Rother&#x27;s more ambient productions which were similar to the first album, albeit more keyboard-driven. Side Two (particularly the song &quot;Hero&quot;) was acknowledged as important influence by many later involved in the United Kingdom&#x27;s punk rock scene, with Dinger&#x27;s sneering, barely intelligible vocals searing across a distorted Motorik beat with aggressive single chord guitar pounding.

To aid with performing on the album (and more importantly, live), Hans Lampe and brother Thomas Dinger were enlisted to help execute more music than was possible by two men. Upon its release, and arguably to this day, &quot;Neu! &#x27;75&quot; is the most diverse record available from the krautrock scene. While this can be seen as a positive point, the differences in musical direction (as well as personal issues) not only isolated the Dinger/Rother duo, it isolated their already small fan base. Neu! broke up after the release of &quot;Neu! &#x27;75&quot;.

Neu! are highly praised in Julian Cope&#x27;s &quot;Krautrocksampler&quot;, along with other krautrock artists such as Kraftwerk and Can, and Cope has also written a song called &quot;Michael Rother&quot; which appears on CD2 of the Deluxe edition of the album &quot;Jehovahkill&quot;.

===1975–1986: Band inactivity and reunion===
In 1974, Rother had already collaborated with German electronic duo Cluster, recording as Harmonia an album titled &quot;Musik Von Harmonia&quot;. In 1975, he recorded a second Harmonia album, &quot;Deluxe&quot;, and further sessions followed with Brian Eno, which were not released until 1997 as &quot;Tracks and Traces&quot;. In 1977, Rother started recording as a solo artist. His first three albums; &quot;Flammende Herzen&quot; (1977), &quot;Sterntaler&quot; (1978), and &quot;Katzenmusik&quot; (1979) were recorded with Neu! producer Conny Plank.

Klaus Dinger, his brother Thomas and Hans Lampe formed La Düsseldorf, cited by David Bowie as &quot;the soundtrack of the eighties&quot;. The band released three successful albums; &quot;La Düsseldorf&quot; (1976), &quot;Viva&quot; (1978) and &quot;Individuellos&quot; (1981).

Between October 1985 and April 1986, Dinger and Rother tried to rekindle the flame that was Neu! by adding more synthesizers and a slightly more commercial aspect to some compositions, the band sounded like a cross between their old selves and the recent new wave groups. However, they were torn apart again by personal and musical issues.

An example of the sharp contrast between Dinger and Rother was evidenced by such tracks as &quot;Crazy&quot;, Rother&#x27;s attempt at pop, and &quot;&#x27;86 Commercial Trash&quot;, a Dingerian collage of dialogue and sound effects from Germany&#x27;s television commercials of that year. The work that took place in these sessions would later resurface as &quot;Neu! 4&quot; in late 1995.

===1987–2009: Acrimony, CD reissues, Dinger&#x27;s death===
Dinger and Rother did not work together during the 1990s, and indeed some degree of bitterness existed between them, not least because Dinger had released a couple of old substandard Neu! recordings on the Japanese Captain Trip label without Rother&#x27;s knowledge or consent. In late 1995, this label released the previously mentioned &quot;Neu! 4&quot; recordings from the 1985–1986 sessions. It also released &quot;Neu! &#x27;72 Live in Düsseldorf&quot; (recorded on 6 May 1972), which comprised poorly recorded rehearsals for some abortive live shows, but notable for the inclusion of Eberhard Kranemann, who had briefly been in Kraftwerk with Dinger.

A 1999 tribute album, entitled &quot;A Homage to Neu!&quot; (Cleopatra Records), features covers from artists including the Legendary Pink Dots, Download, Autechre, Dead Voices on Air, Khan, System 7, and James Plotkin, as well as an original track from Rother entitled &quot;Neutronics 98 (A Tribute to Conny Plank)&quot;. Plank had died in 1987.

For many years the acrimony and legal wrangling between Rother and Dinger prevented their reaching agreement over licensing arrangements to make Neu!&#x27;s music available on CD. In the ensuing vacuum, illegal and inferior-quality bootleg CDs (mastered from old vinyl records) were distributed by an outfit called Germanofon.

This situation was finally resolved in 2001, when Rother and Dinger put aside their differences and entered a studio to transfer the three Neu! albums to CD, from the original master tapes (reportedly mastering each album three times). These were produced and released by Grönland Records (licensed to the Astralwerks label in the United States), packaged with stickers featuring rave reviews by notable artists, including Thom Yorke. Following the release of the first three albums, Dinger and Rother tried but failed to agree on a legal release of &quot;Neu! 4&quot;. Rother called the failure of those negotiations &quot;unfortunate&quot;.

Rother has said that he and Dinger had been considering recording a fifth Neu! album, but the idea was aborted after personal disagreements resurfaced between them. Dinger died of heart failure on 21 March 2008. Rother said that he was unaware of Dinger&#x27;s illness until just before he died.

Rother writes and produces solo albums. Before his death, Dinger was a member of the band La! Neu? - whose name also irritated Rother - as well as collaborating with Miki Yui and band sub-tle. in a project that is unreleased to this date.

===2009–present: &quot;Brand Neu!&quot;, &quot;Neu! &#x27;86&quot;, Hallogallo 2010===
On 25 May 2009, the new record label Feraltone released a compilation CD called &quot;Brand Neu!&quot; containing tracks by many modern artists who credit Neu! as an influence. Most notably, it featured a track from Michael Rother from the previous Neu! homage album (&quot;A Homage to Neu!&quot;) and a new track by La Duesseldorf.de, one of Klaus Dinger&#x27;s final recordings before he died. The compilation features both new and established artists from all around the world including Oasis, Primal Scream, Kasabian, School of Seven Bells, Ciccone Youth (Sonic Youth), Holy Fuck and the young band Pets With Pets from Australia. This was to outline the enormous influence of Neu! which spans multiple decades and countries.

The rights to the Neu! back catalogue are jointly owned by Rother, Dinger&#x27;s estate and Plank&#x27;s widow, Christa Fast. Rother worked with them to produce a box set that included all of Neu!&#x27;s recordings including material that appeared on the &quot;Neu! 4&quot; album (now officially released as &quot;Neu! &#x27;86&quot;). &quot;Neu! Vinyl Box&quot; was released in May 2010 and &quot;Neu! &#x27;86&quot; followed as a standalone release later that year. The box set included some of the &#x27;live&#x27; recordings from 1972 on a maxi single.

In 2010 Rother teamed up with Steve Shelley (of Sonic Youth) and Aaron Mullan (of Tall Firs) for Hallogallo 2010, a live project to present Neu! music and some new pieces. He has since toured sporadically with the German trio Camera, performing the work of Neu!, Harmonia and his own solo music, occasionally with Dieter Möbius of Cluster. Since 2014 he has toured with Hans Lampe and former Camera guitarist Franz Bargmann.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Neu! debut album, Rother played two concerts, Michael Rother &amp; Friends: Celebrate 50 years NEU!. The first in Berlin, on 26 October 2022, and a second concert in London on 3 November 2022.

==Musical style==
Neu!&#x27;s rhythms and sparse atmospherics have been widely influential on genres such as electronica and punk. Their sound was described as &quot;a droning, hypnotic style made up of Mr. Dinger’s simple, perpetual-motion rhythms and Mr. Rother’s fluid guitar effects&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Ben Sisario. Sisario called their first three albums &quot;landmarks of German experimental rock, a genre that was quickly labeled Krautrock by journalists and fans.&quot; AllMusic noted their penchant for &quot;minimalist melodies and lock-groove rhythms.&quot;

The band pioneered the &quot;motorik&quot; beat, a minimalist 4/4 beat often used by drummers associated with krautrock. It is characterised by a kick drum-heavy, pulsating groove, that created a forward-flowing feel. It was probably first used by the group on their debut album and was later adopted by other krautrock bands. Dinger himself later referred to it as the &quot;Apache beat&quot;.

==Influence==
Artists such as David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, Sonic Youth, Stereolab, and Tortoise have drawn on the work of Neu! in their music. Simple Minds took influence from Neu!&#x27;s motorik, repetitive grooves on albums such as &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot; (1979) and &quot;Empires and Dance&quot; (1980). Siouxsie and the Banshees cited the band in their influences. Joy Division and New Order drummer Stephen Morris has cited Klaus Dinger&#x27;s drumming as an important influence on him. Japanese experimental group Boredoms cite Neu! as a prominent influence on their later sound, evident in their unique application of tape manipulation remix techniques and driving 4/4 rhythms pioneered by Rother and Dinger.

<text>Werner Bergengruen (September 16, 1892 – September 4, 1964) was a Baltic German novelist and poet. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
==Life and career==
Bergengruen was born in Riga, Governorate of Livonia, which at that time belonged to the Russian Empire. After growing up in Lübeck and attending the Katharineum, he started studying theology in Marburg in 1911. He later changed to studying Germanistics and art history, but failed to graduate; he then moved to Munich. He served as a lieutenant during World War I and joined the Baltische Landeswehr in 1919 to fight against the Bolsheviks.

On 4 October 1919, he married Charlotte Hensel (1896–1990), a great-granddaughter of the composer Fanny Mendelssohn, and the daughter of the mathematician Kurt Hensel. From the marriage there were four children, Olaf, Luise, Maria and Alexander.

Bergengruen started writing novels and short stories in 1923 and decided to become a full-time writer in 1927. While his earlier works were of a more contemplative nature and pondered metaphysical and religious questions, the Nazis&#x27; rise to power led him to write more political works. His most successful novel, &quot;Der Großtyrann und das Gericht&quot; (&quot;The Grand Tyrant and the Judgment&quot;), published in 1935, is set in the Renaissance era, but the story of a merciless tyrant playing with the weaknesses of his underlings was often seen as a clear allegory on Germany&#x27;s political situation. This interpretation is doubtful, though, as most of the novel was written before the Nazi takeover in 1933. In 1936 Bergengruen was received into the Catholic Church. The same year he moved to Munich; his new neighbour was Carl Muth, editor of the Catholic monthly Hochland. In 1937 he was expelled from the for being unfit to contribute to German culture. Although Bergengruen was politically a staunch conservative, his Catholicism—as well as the fact that his wife was of partly Jewish heritage—contributed to his alienation from the Nazi regime.

In 1942, after his house in Munich was destroyed by bombs, Bergengruen moved to Achenkirch. After World War II, he lived in Switzerland, Rome, and finally Baden-Baden, where he died in 1964.

<doc id="954150" wikidata="Q349347" url="?curid=954150" title="Adam Foote">
<text>Adam David Vernon Foote (born July 10, 1971) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman, the current Assistant Coach of the Vancouver Canucks of National Hockey League, and the former head coach of the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League. He was best known for his physical presence and gritty play as a stay-at-home defenceman.

Foote was drafted out of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) 22nd overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by the Quebec Nordiques. He began his National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Nordiques in 1991–92 before the franchise relocated to Colorado, where he won two Stanley Cups in 1996 and 2001. In 2005, Foote signed with the Columbus Blue Jackets, where he served as team captain for three seasons. He then returned to the Avalanche in 2008 via trade, where he would eventually complete his playing career. Foote was the last active NHL player from the Quebec Nordiques.

Internationally, Foote won a gold medal in 2002 Winter Olympics and a World Cup championship in 2004 with Team Canada.

Foote is the father of NHL players Cal and Nolan Foote.

==Playing career==

===Minor/Junior===

Foote grew up playing hockey for the Brooklin-Whitby Minor Hockey Association (OMHA). He was a teammate of future NHLer Keith Primeau for several years, leading their teams to several OMHA &quot;AA&quot; Championships in the early 1980s. After a successful midget season with Brooklin-Whitby&#x27;s AA team, Foote was a second-round underage choice, 21st overall, of the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the 1988 OHL Priority Selection. Foote went on to play three OHL seasons with the Greyhounds, winning a J. Ross Robertson Cup and appearing in the Memorial Cup in his final season under future NHL head coach Ted Nolan.

===Professional===
Foote was selected 22nd overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. He played for Quebec for four seasons until the franchise moved to Colorado to become the Avalanche in 1995–96. Foote won his first of two Stanley Cups with the Avalanche that year, sweeping the Florida Panthers in the Finals. Five years later, Foote helped the Avalanche to a second Stanley Cup championship in 2001, defeating the New Jersey Devils in seven games.

The following season, in 2001–02, Foote recorded a career-high 22 assists in the regular season before missing out on his second straight Stanley Cup Finals appearance with the Avalanche, losing in seven games to the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals. In 2002–03, Foote had another career-year offensively, scoring personal bests of 11 goals and 31 points. After a 30-point campaign in 2003–04, he remained inactive in 2004–05 due to the NHL lockout.
When NHL play was set to resume in 2005–06, Foote parted ways with the Avalanche franchise after 13 seasons, signing a three-year contract worth $13.5 million with the Columbus Blue Jackets on August 1, 2005. He was immediately named an alternate captain for the upcoming season, but was assigned the Blue Jackets&#x27; captaincy in December 2005 when defenceman Luke Richardson stepped down from the position. He became the fourth captain in franchise history.

Three seasons later, with his contract set to expire, Foote was traded from the Blue Jackets back to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for two conditional draft picks on February 26, 2008. The trade occurred amid speculation that the Blue Jackets were trying to re-sign Foote to keep him in Columbus, but could not meet Foote&#x27;s asking price. Later that night, he arrived in Calgary during the first period to play against the Flames. Foote managed one goal and 15 assists for a total of 16 points in 75 games with the Avs and Blue Jackets combined.

On June 30, 2008, Foote agreed to re-sign with the Avalanche with a two-year $6 million deal at $3 million per season. His first full season back in Colorado was cut short by injury and he managed just 42 games. Further major injuries to key players in the lineup resulted in the Avalanche finishing in last place in the Western Conference. The following off-season, long-time Avalanche captain Joe Sakic announced his retirement. As training camp was set to begin for the 2009–10 season, Foote was named Sakic&#x27;s successor on September 11, 2009, becoming the eighth captain in franchise history (including the Nordiques) and just the second in Avalanche history.

On May 25, 2010, the Avalanche re-signed Foote to a one-year contract extension for the 2010–11 season worth approximately $1 million.

On April 10, 2011, Foote played his last game with the Avalanche, winning 4–3 in overtime against the Edmonton Oilers during the season finale. He was awarded first star of the game. Foote was the last former Nordique to be active in the NHL. On November 2, 2013, Foote had his number 52 jersey retired by the Avalanche, joining elite company in Ray Bourque, Patrick Roy, Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg in sharing the honour.

==Coaching career==
After his playing career, Foote was hired by his former club the Colorado Avalanche as a defensive coach from 2011 to 2017. On October 23, 2018, It was announced that Foote had been named the head coach for the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League. He was subsequently fired as head coach by the Rockets in February 2020. On January 22, 2023, it was announced that Foote had been hired as an assistant coach for the Vancouver Canucks upon the mid season hiring of new head coach Rick Tocchet.

==Personal life==
Foote played minor hockey in Whitby, Ontario, and lived in Newcastle, Ontario, on the north shore of Lake Ontario. He lived there during the late 1990s before relocating to Whitby. Foote and his wife Jennifer have two sons – Callan, who was born prematurely on December 13, 1998, and Nolan, born November 29, 2000. He eventually joined the team that both his sons played for, Western Hockey League&#x27;s Kelowna Rockets, as head coach from October 2018 to February 2020. His youngest son, Nolan was team captain at the time of his departure.

==International play==



Foote debuted for Team Canada at the inaugural World Cup in 1996, scoring one goal as Canada finished as runner-up to the United States. Two years later, Foote was named to Team Canada for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. The tournament marked the first time NHL players were allowed to participate in the Olympics. Foote managed an assist in six games as Canada finished in fourth place, losing to the Czech Republic in the semi-finals, then Finland in the bronze medal game. At the next Winter Olympics in 2002, Foote helped Canada end a 50-year gold medal drought in the ice hockey tournament by defeating the United States in the final. He won another championship two years later and was even selected to the Tournament All-Star Team in his second World Cup in 2004, defeating Finland in the final. Selected to play in his third Olympics at the 2006 Games in Turin, Italy, Canada finished a disappointing seventh place while attempting to defend their gold medal from the prior tournament.

<doc id="954164" wikidata="Q5635009" url="?curid=954164" title="HMS Wolverine (1910)">
<text>HMS &quot;Wolverine&quot; was a of the Royal Navy launched on 15 January 1910. She was built by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Wolverine&quot; was one of three s ordered from the shipbuilder Cammell Laird as part of the 1908–1909 shipbuilding programme. The &quot;Beagle&quot;s were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification. &quot;Wolverine&quot;, like the other two Laird-built ships, was long, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal. Five Yarrow boilers fed direct-drive Parsons steam turbines driving three propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at to meet the design speed of . Gun armament consisted of one BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VIII and three QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns. Torpedo armament consisted of two 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Two spare torpedoes were carried.

&quot;Wolverine&quot; was laid down at Laird&#x27;s Birkenhead shipyard on 26 April 1904 and was launched on 15 January 1910. She reached a speed of on her sea trials, meeting the contract requirement of 27 knots, and was completed in September 1910.

==Service history==
On commissioning, &quot;Wolverine&quot; joined the First Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet. In 1912, the Royal Navy&#x27;s destroyer flotillas were re-organized, with the &quot;Beagle&quot;s joining the Third Destroyer Flotilla. &quot;Wolverine&quot; remained part of the Third Flotilla until August 1913, but had transferred to the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet by November that year.

At the outbreak of the First World War, &quot;Wolverine&quot; was still in the Mediterranean, as a member of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. The flotilla, including &quot;Wolverine&quot;, was involved in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser . &quot;Wolverine&quot; was one of eight destroyers deployed by Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge to assist his squadron of Armoured cruisers in stopping the German ships escaping to Austrian waters. When it was realised that &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; were not heading to Austria, Troubridge left these destroyers behind as they did not have sufficient coal left for a high speed pursuit, and set off southwards on the night of 6/7 August 1914 with his four Armoured cruisers. He called off his pursuit later that night because he could not intercept the German squadron until daylight, when &quot;Goeben&quot;″s superior speed and armament would give the Germans a significant advantage. On 1 November 1914 she and the destroyer sank a Turkish armed yacht, believed to be involved in minelaying operations, in the Gulf of Smyrna.

In 1915, along with numerous other &quot;Beagle&quot;, and destroyers, she took part in the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign. Early operations involved escorting trawlers when they attempted to sweep Turkish minefields in the narrows of the Dardanelles. During the initial landings at ANZAC Cove and at Cape Helles, &quot;Wolverine&quot; joined several other destroyers in minesweeping operations in the Dardanelles straits to allow Allied battleships to bombard Turkish positions. On 28 April, &quot;Wolverine&quot; was sweeping in conjunction with sister ship (the sweep wire was run between the two ships) when she was hit on the ship&#x27;s bridge by a Turkish shell, which killed Commander Osmond J. Prentis, &quot;Wolverine&quot;″ s captain and two more men. On the night of 12/13 May, the pre-dreadnought battleships and were anchored in Morto Bay, supporting French troops. To protect the two battleships, &quot;Beagle&quot; and &quot;Bulldog&quot; patrolled the north side of the straits, with &quot;Scorpion&quot; and &quot;Wolverine&quot; patrolling the southern side and in the centre of the straits. Despite these patrols, the Turkish destroyer managed to sneak past &quot;Beagle&quot; and &quot;Bulldog&quot; on the northern side of the straits and torpedoed and sunk &quot;Goliath&quot; before successfully escaping. On releasing that &quot;Goliath&quot; had been torpedoed, &quot;Wolverine&quot; and &quot;Scorpion&quot; attempted to cut off the Turkish destroyer, but &quot;Muavenet-i Milliye&quot; evaded them.

Work included naval artillery support, particular at the Cape Helles beachhead. On 28 June &quot;Wolverine&quot; provided support for the advancing forces at the Battle of Gully Ravine, helping to break up a Turkish counter attack. She provided cover for the final evacuation from Cape Helles on the night of 8/9 January 1916. From March 1916, &quot;Wolverine&quot; operated in the Aegean, patrolling the Dodecanese, Sporades and Cyclades and the Turkish coast, carrying raiding parties of Greek and Cretan irregular troops commanded by the classical scholar John Myres which carried out cattle raids on the Turkish coast.

&quot;Wolverine&quot; was recalled to home waters and assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla now based at Buncrana, near Lough Swilly in the north of Ireland in October 1917. On 12 December 1917, &quot;Wolverine&quot; was part of an escort group on the way to rendezvous with a Britain-bound Atlantic convoy off the northwest coast of Ireland, when the force&#x27;s senior officer, aboard ordered a course change. After carrying out the manoeuvre, &quot;Wolverine&quot; was rammed by the fleet sweeping sloop , with the destroyer rolling over and sinking as a result of the damage received. Two of &quot;Wolverine&quot;″s crew were killed. The collision was blamed on &quot;Rosemary&quot;″s bridge crew, and in particular her officer of the watch, who had carried out the course change too early, and then reversed the manoeuvre, putting the sloop on collision course with the destroyer, with there being no time for successful evasive action.

<doc id="954167" wikidata="Q432362" url="?curid=954167" title="Antony Sher">
<text>Sir Antony Sher (14 June 1949 – 2 December 2021) was a British actor, writer and theatre director of South African origin. A two-time Laurence Olivier Award winner and a five-time nominee, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1982 and toured in many roles, as well as appearing on film and television. In 2001, he starred in his cousin Ronald Harwood&#x27;s play &quot;Mahler&#x27;s Conversion&quot;, and said that the story of a composer sacrificing his faith for his career echoed his own identity struggles.

During his 2017 &quot;Commonwealth Tour&quot;, Prince Charles referred to Sher as his favourite actor. Sher and his partner and collaborator Gregory Doran became one of the first same-sex couples to enter into a civil partnership in the UK.

==Early life and education==

Sher was born on 14 June 1949 in Cape Town, South Africa, the son of Margery (Abramowitz) and Emmanuel Sher, who worked in business. He was a first cousin once removed of the playwright Sir Ronald Harwood.

He grew up in the suburb of Sea Point, where he attended Sea Point High School.

Sher moved to the United Kingdom in 1968 and auditioned at the Central School of Speech and Drama and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), but was unsuccessful. He instead studied at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art from 1969 to 1971 and subsequently on the one-year postgraduate course run jointly by Manchester University Drama Department and the Manchester School of Theatre.

Sher became a British citizen in 1979.

==Career==
In the 1970s, Sher was part of a group of young actors and writers working at the Liverpool Everyman Theatre. Comprising figures such as writers Alan Bleasdale and Willy Russell and fellow actors Trevor Eve, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Pryce, and Julie Walters, Sher summed up the work of the company with the phrase &quot;anarchy ruled&quot;. He also performed with the theatre group Gay Sweatshop, before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1982.

While a member of the RSC, Sher was cast in the title role in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, and played the Fool in &quot;King Lear&quot;. His major break came in 1984, when he performed the title role in &quot;Richard III&quot; and won the Laurence Olivier Award. Also for the RSC, Sher performed the lead in such productions as &quot;Tamburlaine&quot;, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, &quot;Stanley&quot;, and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and in 2014 played Falstaff in &quot;Henry IV&quot; Part 1 and &quot;Henry IV&quot; Part 2 in Stratford-upon-Avon and on national tour. He played the eponymous &#x27;King Lear&#x27; from 2016 to 2018. He also played Johnnie in Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;Hello and Goodbye&quot;, Iago in &quot;Othello&quot;, Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Sher received his second Laurence Olivier Award in 1997 for his performance as Stanley Spencer in &quot;Stanley&quot;.

In 2001, Sher played the role of the composer Gustav Mahler in Ronald Harwood&#x27;s play &quot;Mahler&#x27;s Conversion&quot;, about Mahler&#x27;s decision to renounce his Jewish faith prior to his appointment as conductor and artistic director of the Vienna State Opera House in 1897. Speaking about the role to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Rupert Smith, Sher revealed: When I came to England in 1968, at 19, I looked around me and I didn&#x27;t see any Jewish leading men in the classical theatre, so I thought it best to conceal my Jewishness. Also, I quickly became conscious of apartheid when I arrived here, and I didn&#x27;t want to be known as a white South African. I was brought up in a very apolitical family. We were happy to enjoy the benefits of apartheid without questioning the system behind it. Reading about apartheid when I came to England was a terrible shock. So I lost the accent almost immediately, and if anyone asked me where I was from I would lie. If they asked where I went to school, I&#x27;d say Hampstead, which got me into all sorts of trouble because of course everyone else went to school in Hampstead and they wanted to know which one. Then there was my sexuality. The theatre was full of gay people, but none of them were out, and there was that ugly story about Gielgud being arrested for cottaging, so I thought I&#x27;d better hide that as well. Each of these things went into the closet until my entire identity was in the closet. That&#x27;s why this play appealed to me so much: it&#x27;s about an artist changing his identity in order to get what he wants.

In 2015, he played Willy Loman in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;.

He also had several film credits to his name, including &quot;Yanks&quot; (1979), &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), &quot;Shadey&quot; (1985), and &quot;Erik the Viking&quot; (1989). Sher starred as the Chief Weasel in the 1996 film adaptation of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and as Benjamin Disraeli in the 1997 film &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;.

Sher&#x27;s television appearances include the mini-series &quot;The History Man&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Jury&quot; (2002). In 2003, he played the central character in an adaptation of the J. G. Ballard short story &quot;The Enormous Space&quot;, filmed as &quot;Home&quot; and broadcast on BBC Four. In &quot;Hornblower&quot; (1999), he played the role of French royalist Colonel de Moncoutant, Marquis de Muzillac, in the episode &quot;The Frogs and the Lobsters&quot;. Sher&#x27;s more recent credits included a cameo in the British comedy film &quot;Three and Out&quot; (2008) and the role of Akiba in the television play &quot;God on Trial&quot; (2008).

Sher was cast in the role of Thráin II, father of Thorin Oakenshield in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, but appears only in the Extended Edition of the film.

In 2018, he played the title role in &quot;King Lear&quot; and was the only person to play both the Fool and King Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Company. He returned to Stratford-upon-Avon in 2019 to perform in &quot;Kunene and the King&quot; with John Kani.

===Other work===
Sher&#x27;s books included the memoirs &quot;Year of the King&quot; (1985), &quot;Woza Shakespeare: Titus Andronicus in South Africa&quot; (with Gregory Doran, 1997), &quot;Beside Myself&quot; (an autobiography, 2002), &quot;Primo Time&quot; (2005), and &quot;Year of the Fat Knight&quot; (2015), a book of paintings and drawings, &quot;Characters&quot; (1990), and the novels &quot;Middlepost&quot; (1989), &quot;Cheap Lives&quot; (1995), &quot;The Indoor Boy&quot; (1996). and &quot;The Feast&quot; (1999). His 2018 book &quot;Year of the Mad King&quot; won the 2019 Theatre Book Prize, awarded by the Society for Theatre Research.

Sher also wrote several plays, including &quot;I.D.&quot; (2003) and &quot;Primo&quot; (2004). The latter was adapted as a film in 2005. In 2008, &quot;The Giant&quot;, the first of his plays in which Sher did not feature, was performed at the Hampstead Theatre. The main characters are Michelangelo (at the time of his creation of David), Leonardo da Vinci, and Vito, their mutual apprentice.

In 2005, Sher directed &quot;Breakfast With Mugabe&quot; at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. The production moved to the Soho Theatre in April 2006 and the Duchess Theatre one month later. In 2007, he made a crime documentary for Channel 4, titled &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot;, about his native South Africa. It examines the double murder of actor Brett Goldin and fashion designer Richard Bloom. In 2011, Sher appeared in the BBC TV series &quot;The Shadow Line&quot; in the role of Glickman.

==Personal life, illness and death==
In 2005, Sher and the director Gregory Doran, with whom he frequently collaborated professionally, entered into a civil partnership in the UK. They married on 30 December 2015, a little over ten years after the registration of their civil partnership.

On 10 September 2021, it was announced that Sher was terminally ill and Doran took compassionate leave from the RSC to care for him. Sher died from cancer at his home in Stratford-upon-Avon on 2 December 2021, aged 72.

<text>The Service Management Framework (SMF) is a software product by IBM which implements the OSGi Service Platform.

It is available as a component of other IBM products, including IBM Lotus Expeditor, a platform enabling OSGi developers to build configurable, disconnectable, managed, applications and services for desktop, mobile, and embeddable clients delivering web, Ajax, and/or rich user interfaces.

According to the internet archive support for this was dropped in October 2007, this is unexplained and may be because of the new release of the OSGi standard r4. (This is most likely because it was turned over to Eclipse to be the Equinox launcher)

<text>Restoring the Balance was a satirical radio segment that occasionally appeared on Australian radio station Triple J. It satirically displayed the contrasting political views between the then conservative Australian Howard government, and the majority of the Left wing government-funded Triple J radio station. The premise of the show suggested that the station was forced by the ABC board to broadcast a segment of right wing political views in order to &quot;restore the balance&quot;. The creators began by conducting satirical interviews with Australian political identities in 2003. The show itself was broadcast sporadically on Sunday afternoons during 2004, and then began as a series broadcasting on 25 February 2007.

==Format==
The show features the characters of young Liberal Stirling Addison and young National Tom Thomlinson. The pair are played by Tony Moclair and Julian Schiller respectively. They represent the more affluent end of Australian society - Addison from the city, Thomlinson from a farming area. The characters portrayed on the show are extreme in their views, which has resulted in complaints from callers who do not realise the show is a parody.

The official site lists brief outlines of each of the characters. Addison is a Sydney Grammar Old Boy and his profile includes:
* &quot;Baptised into the Anglican Church in 1981 before its sell out to left wing homosexual minority interests.&quot;
* &quot;Elected Grade 5 student president - remembered for sacking tuck shop mothers for displaying signs of &#x27;unionised&#x27; activity.&quot;
* &quot;Royal Tennis champion 3 years in a row (by default &#x27;94/&#x27;95, &#x27;96 victory still subject of inquiry)&quot;
* &quot;Winner of the CJ Asquith prize for inter-collegiate oration representing St Andrews College, for speech &quot;Melanie Howard - a life of virtue&quot;.&quot;

Thom Thomlinson is described as &quot;a simple farm boy at heart&quot;, who grew up on his family&#x27;s 100 000 hectare property in rural Queensland. Gems from his past include:

* &quot;Boarded at Geelong Grammar.&quot;
* &quot;Last day of school, hijacks bus and drives into boarding school dorm - several students injured but refuse to press charges. In non-related incident, father donates $25 000 to Old Grammarians fund. Bus driver later sacked for reckless endangerment.&quot;
* &quot;Graduates accelerated degree in Ag Science/Banking at Bond University after failing first year twice. In non-related incident, father donates $25 000 to Bond University&#x27;s Vice Chancellor’s Fund.&quot;

Schiller and Moclair also filled in on Triple J as a one-off in the Sunday morning shift where they appeared as themselves. In August 2004, Schiller and Moclair signed on to do breakfast radio at Nova 91.9, an Adelaide station.

==Broadcast==
It was announced that from 25 February 2007, Stirling Addison would return to Triple J on Sunday evenings to host a new series of Restoring the Balance (apparently without Thom Thomlinson as a co-host). John Safran, the previous host of this timeslot, has allegedly gone on a 10-week hiatus due to his other media commitments. In character, Stirling insisted that this change was instead approved by the ABC board due to the current segment being &quot;too semitic&quot;, and displaying &quot;a lack of traditional right-wing values&quot;. Amongst other things, he then went on to approve the taxpayer-funded visit of U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney to Sydney, and stated how &quot;it would be an honour to be shot in the face by the Vice President&quot;.

2007 saw the inclusion of Spencer Penrose, a Family First member as co-host (played by Richard Marsland). 

Restoring The Balance made its last appearance on Triple J in a stint airing on Sundays at 9pm, from 24 July until Sept 11, 2011.

<text>NeoOffice was an office suite for the macOS operating system developed by Planamesa Inc. It was a commercial fork of the free and open source LibreOffice office suite, including a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation program, and graphics program. It added some features not present in the macOS versions of LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice. The last few versions were based on LibreOffice 4.4, which was released mid-2014.

The last version was 2022.7, released 2 September 2023. 

NeoOffice is no longer active as of December 2023. The project recommends users move to LibreOffice, to which Patrick Luby of NeoOffice is a contributor.

== History ==
Versions of OpenOffice.org for Mac prior to 3.0 did not have a native Mac OS X interface; they required that either X11.app or XDarwin be installed.

NeoOffice was the first OpenOffice.org fork to offer a native Mac OS X experience, with easier installation, better integration into the Mac OS X interface (pull-down menus at the top of the screen and familiar keyboard shortcuts, for example), use of Mac OS X&#x27;s fonts and printing services without additional configuration, and integration with the Mac OS X clipboard and drag-and-drop functions. Subsequently, both LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice followed NeoOffice&#x27;s lead and implemented similarly native Mac OS X interfaces.

NeoOffice began as a project to investigate methods of creating a native port of OpenOffice.org to Mac OS X. The project now called NeoOffice was originally dubbed &quot;NeoOffice/J&quot;, reflecting its use of Mac OS X&#x27;s Java integration to enable a native application. A related project was NeoOffice/C, which was a simultaneous effort to develop a version using Apple&#x27;s Cocoa APIs. But NeoOffice/C proved very difficult to implement and the application was highly unstable, so the project was set aside in favor of the more promising NeoOffice/J. The &quot;/J&quot; suffix was dropped with version 1.2, since there was no longer another variety of NeoOffice from which to distinguish it. Many of these releases were preceded by a version that only Early Access Members could download; these versions were released about a month before the official release date.

All versions from NeoOffice 3.1.1 to NeoOffice 2015 were based on OpenOffice.org 3.1.1, though latter versions included stability fixes from LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice. NeoOffice 2017 and later versions are fully based on LibreOffice.

In 2013, NeoOffice moved to a commercial distribution model via the Mac App Store. As of 2016, the source code is still available for free, but the software package was only available with the purchase of a commercial license. This has changed in 2022 as the code and all commits are released on GitHub. Moreover, the whole application is free of charge. Currently the NeoOffice website has the tag line, &quot;An old fork of LibreOffice&quot;, and the notice: &quot;The NeoOffice project is no longer active. As a replacement, you may want to try LibreOffice&quot;.

By default, NeoOffice loads and saves files in the OpenDocument file format, although this can be changed by the user. The OpenDocument file format is an XML file format standardized by OASIS (Organisation for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards).

== Licensing ==

Sun first released OpenOffice.org under both the LGPL and SISSL, later under only the LGPL, with a requirement for copyright assignment for any contributions to the main code base, which allowed Sun to create proprietary versions of the software (notably StarOffice). NeoOffice chose not to assign its code to Sun, which prevented Sun from using NeoOffice code in official OpenOffice.org versions.

There were initially some attempts to resolve the licensing differences and foster more direct cooperation and code-sharing between the NeoOffice and OpenOffice.org developers. However, the NeoOffice developers said that they preferred to work separately from OpenOffice.org because &quot;coordination requires a significant amount of time.&quot; The OpenOffice.org developers said that &quot;a proposal to work together has been made, and NeoOffice developers refused&quot;. The NeoOffice developers subsequently expressed support for LibreOffice and the launch of The Document Foundation.

<doc id="954192" wikidata="Q20826647" url="?curid=954192" title="Guatemalans">
<text>Guatemalans ( or less commonly ) are people connected to the country of Guatemala. This connection may be residential, legal, historical or cultural. For most Guatemalans, several (if not all) of these connections exist.

Guatemala is a multicultural society, though most Guatemalans have varying degrees of European (predominantly Spaniards) and Amerindian ancestry. Guatemalans are also colloquially nicknamed C&quot;hapines&quot; in other Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America.

== Demographics ==

Guatemala has a population of 17,153,288 (July 2020 est). In 1900, Guatemala had a population of 885,000. Guatemala had the fastest population growth in the Western Hemisphere during 20th century. Approximately half of the Guatemalan population lives in poverty and 13.7% of them live in extreme poverty.

Guatemala is heavily centralized. Transportation, communications, business, politics, and the most relevant urban activity takes place in Guatemala City. Guatemala City has about 2 million inhabitants within the city limits and more than 5 million within the wider urban area. This is a significant percentage of the population (14 million).

The estimated median age in Guatemala is 20 years old, 19.4 for males and 20.7 years for females. This is the lowest median age of any country in the Western Hemisphere and comparable to most of central Africa and Iraq.

=== Ethnic groups ===
According to the 2018 Census, about 56.57% of the population identifies as non-indigenous. The majority, or 56.01% are Ladinos, those include Mestizos, people mixed European with Amerindian, another part but visible are Whites of European descent, specially Spanish, German and Italian, (in Colonia Era, direct descendants of Spanish were called as Criollo). The Amerindian populations as of 2002 Census include the K&#x27;iche&#x27; 9.1%, Q&#x27;eqchi 8.4%, Kaqchikel 7.9%, Mam 6.3% and 8.6% of the population is &quot;other Mayan&quot;, 0.4% is indigenous non-Mayan, making the indigenous community in Guatemala about 40.3% of the population.

There are smaller communities present, including about 15,000 Salvadorans. The Garífuna, who are descended primarily from Africans who lived with and intermarried with indigenous peoples from St. Vincent, live mainly in Livingston and Puerto Barrios. Those communities have other blacks and mulattos descended from the Spanish Slave Trade. There are also Asians, mostly of Chinese descent. Other Asian groups include Arabs of Lebanese and Syrian descent. There is also a growing Korean community in Guatemala City and in nearby Mixco, currently numbering about 6,000. Guatemala&#x27;s German population is credited with bringing the tradition of a Christmas tree to the country.

==== Mestizo ====
Guatemalan mestizos are people of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. They may also have varying degrees of African or Asian ancestry. Mixed Guatemalans could reach 60% with people of different grades of mixture, but the culture environment into different communities can influence people to identify as Indigenous, Ladino or White. The mestizo population in Guatemala is concentrated in urban areas of the country (the national capital and departmental capitals). Genetic testing indicates that Guatemalan Mestizos are on average of predominantly indigenous ancestry.

Historically the mestizo population in the Kingdom of Guatemala at the time of Independence amounted to nearly 600,000 Indians, 300,000 castes (mostly mestizos and a lesser number of mulattos), and 45,000 criollos or Spanish, with a very small number of Spaniards.

==== Indigenous ====

The Amerindian populations in Guatemala are estimated from 41.7% to the half of population. According to the last Census, the distribution are formed by K&#x27;iche&#x27; 9.1%, Kaqchikel 8.4%, Mam 7.9% and Q&#x27;eqchi 6.3%. 8.6% of the population is &quot;other Mayan,&quot; 0.4% is indigenous non-Mayan, making the indigenous community in Guatemala about 40.3% of the population.

==== Garifuna ====
The Garífuna, who are descended primarily from Africans who lived with and intermarried with indigenous peoples from St. Vincent, live mainly in Livingston and Puerto Barrios.

==== Criollo and other European descendants ====
The term Criollo refers to Guatemalans of mostly or fully Spanish descent. Other European ethnic groups include those of Germans, Italians, English, and Belgian descent. Other ancestry can include those from Eastern Europe and White Americans.

===Languages===
Spanish is the official language. As a first and second language, Spanish is spoken by 93% of the population as second or third language.

Twenty-one Mayan languages are spoken, especially in rural areas, as well as two non-Mayan Amerindian languages, Xinca, an indigenous language, and Garifuna, an Arawakan language spoken on the Caribbean coast. According to the Language Law of 2003, the languages of Mayas, Xincas, and Garifunas are unrecognized as National Languages.

The peace accords signed in December 1996 provide for the translation of some official documents and voting materials into several indigenous languages (see summary of main substantive accords) and mandate the provision of interpreters in legal cases for non-Spanish speakers. The accord also sanctioned bilingual education in Spanish and indigenous languages. It is common for indigenous Guatemalans to learn or speak between two and five of the nation&#x27;s other languages, and Spanish.

===Diaspora===
The Civil War forced many Guatemalans to start lives outside of their country. The majority of the Guatemalan diaspora is located in the United States of America, with estimates ranging from 480,665 to 1,489,426. The difficulty in getting accurate counts for Guatemalans abroad is because many of them are refugee claimants awaiting determination of their status. Emigration to the United States of America has led to the growth of Guatemalan communities in California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Rhode Island and elsewhere since the 1970s.

Below are estimates for certain countries:
=== Immigration ===
During the colonial era Guatemala received immigrants (settlers) only from Spain. Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century. Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom fincas in Alta Verapaz, Zacapa, Quetzaltenango, Baja Verapaz and Izabal departments. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.

Many Europeans who emigrated to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, families, entrepreneurs and mainly settlers, Guatemala had long been the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind Costa Rica for 1950, that does not mean that the country no longer receive large numbers of immigrants.

From the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from Korea, China, Japan, Singapore and the Philippines) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also beginning with the First World War, the immigrant population is being strengthened by Jewish and Pakistani immigration.

During the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew strong in Guatemala, particularly from other Central American countries, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, etc. Although the majority of them resided only temporarily to go to their final destination, which was the United States.

== Guatemalan culture ==
=== Cuisine ===
The Guatemalan cuisine reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments (or divisions), each of which has very different varieties of food.. For example, Antigua Guatemala is well known for its candy which makes use of many local ingredients fruits, seeds and nuts along with honey, condensed milk and other traditional sweeteners. Antigua&#x27;s candy is very popular when tourists visit the country for the first time, and is a great choice in the search for new and interesting flavors.

Many traditional foods are based on Maya cuisine and prominently feature corn, chilis and beans as key ingredients. Various dishes may have the same name as dishes from a neighboring country, but may in fact be quite different for example the enchilada or quesadilla, which are nothing like their Mexican counterparts.
There are also foods that it is traditional to eat on certain days of the week – for example, by tradition it is known that on Thursday, the typical food is &quot;paches&quot;, which is like a tamale made with a base of potato, and on Sundays it is traditional to eat tamales, due to the fact that Sundays are considered holidays. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as fiambre for All Saints Day on November 1 and tamales, which are common Christmas.

There are reportedly hundreds of varieties of tamales throughout Guatemala. They key variations are what is in the &quot;masa&quot; or dough (maize, potatoes, rice), what&#x27;s in the filling (meat, fruits, nuts), and what is it wrapped with (leaves, husks). The masa is made out of corn that is not sweet, such as what is known as feed corn in the U.S.A. In Guatemala, this non-sweet corn is called maize and the corn that Americans from the US are used to eating on the cob, sweet corn, they call &quot;elote&quot;. Tamales in Guatemala are more typically wrapped in plantain, banana, or maxan leaves rather than corn husks.

The ancient Mayan civilization lasted for about six hundred years before collapsing around 900 A.D. Today, almost half of the Guatemalan population is Mayan. These natives live throughout the country and grow maize as their staple crop. In addition, the ancient Maya ate amaranth, a breakfast cereal similar to modern day cereals.
=== Music ===
Guatemala&#x27;s national instrument is the marimba, an idiophone from the family of the xylophones, which is played all over the country, even in the remotest corners. Towns also have wind and percussion bands that play during the Lent and Easter-week processions, as well as on other occasions. The Garifuna people of descent, who are spread thinly on the northeastern Caribbean coast, have their own distinct varieties of popular and folk music. Cumbia, from the Colombian variety, is also very popular, especially among the lower classes.
=== Literature ===

The Guatemala National Prize in Literature is a one-time only award that recognizes an individual writer&#x27;s body of work. It has been given annually since 1988 by the Ministry of Culture and Sports.

Miguel Ángel Asturias won the literature Nobel Prize in 1967. Among his famous books is &quot;El Señor Presidente&quot;, a novel based on the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera.

Rigoberta Menchú, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting oppression of indigenous people in Guatemala, is famous for her books &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchú&quot; and &quot;Crossing Borders.&quot;

=== Religion ===

Historically, Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish and was the official religion during the colonial era. However, the practice of Protestantism has increased markedly in recent decades, with nearly one third of Guatemalans identifying themselves as Protestants, chiefly Evangelicals and Pentecostals. Growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Mayan population, with National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala being an important denomination, maintaining 11 indigenous-language Presbyteries.

Traditional Mayan religion persists through the process of inculturation, whereby certain practices are incorporated into Catholic ceremonies and worship when they are sympathetic to the meaning of Catholic belief. Indigenous religious practices are increasing as a result of the cultural protections established under the peace accords. The government has instituted a policy of providing altars at every Mayan ruin found in the country, so traditional ceremonies may be performed there.

<doc id="954193" wikidata="Q1186076" url="?curid=954193" title="Democracy Monument">
<text>The Democracy Monument () is a public monument in the city center of Bangkok, capital of Thailand. It occupies a traffic circle on the wide east–west Ratchadamnoen Avenue, at the intersection of Dinso Road. The monument is roughly halfway between Sanam Luang, the former royal cremation ground in front of Wat Phra Kaew, and the temple of the Golden Mount (Phu Kao Thong).

==Commissioning==
The monument was commissioned in 1939 to commemorate the 1932 Siamese coup d&#x27;état (also called &quot;Siamese Revolution of 1932&quot; or just &quot;1932 Revolution&quot;) which led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in what was then the Kingdom of Siam, by its military ruler, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram. Phibun saw the monument as the focal point of what he envisaged as a new, Westernized Bangkok, &quot;making Thanon [road] Ratchadamnoen the Champs-Élysées and the Democracy Monument the Arc de Triomphe&quot; of Bangkok.

==Design==
The monument was designed by , an architect whose brother, Khuang Aphaiwong, was a leading member of Phibun&#x27;s government. The Italian sculptor Corrado Feroci, who became a Thai citizen and used the Thai name Silpa Bhirasi from the Second World War on, initially to avoid Japanese military ire, executed the relief sculptures around the base of the monument. He also provided the main sculpting for the renowned Lady Mo monument in the northeast Thailand city of Nakhon Ratchasima.

The building of the monument was highly unpopular at the time. Local residents and shopkeepers (mostly Chinese) were evicted from their homes and businesses with 60 days&#x27; notice. The widening of Ratchadamnoen Road to create a ceremonial boulevard involved cutting down hundreds of shade trees, a serious matter in the days before air conditioning, given Bangkok&#x27;s torrid climate.

It was built by Christiani &amp; Nielsen.

===Design elements===
The focal point of the monument (Figure 1 below) is a carved representation of a palm-leaf manuscript box holding the Thai Constitution of 1932, on top of two golden offering bowls above a round turret. The constitution is symbolically guarded by four wing-like structures (Figure 2 below), representing the four branches of the Thai armed forces—army, navy, air force and police—which carried out the 1932 coup.

The wings are high, and this is also the radius of the base of the monument, marking the fact that the 1932 coup took place on 24 June. The central turret is high, representing the month of June, which is the third month of the traditional Thai calendar. There were originally 75 small cannon around the outer ring of the monument, representing the year of the coup, 2475 in the Buddhist calendar. The six gates of the turret represent the six proclaimed policies of the People Party: &quot;independence, internal peace, equality, freedom, economy, and education.&quot;

Facing outwards from the base of two of the wings are fountains (Figure 3 below) in the form of naga, the protective snake creatures of Hindu and Buddhist mythology, although the sculptures resemble Western dragons more than traditional naga sculptures. (Compare Figure 3 below with the image at the Naga article.)

The relief sculptures at the base of the monument are propagandistic in their design. They depict the armed forces both as champions of democracy and as the personification of the Thai people. In the version of events depicted in these sculptures, the coup of 1932 was carried out by a united and idealistic Thai armed forces on behalf of the people, and had both the intention and effect of making Thailand a democracy. In the reliefs, civilians appear only as the grateful recipients of the heroism and benevolence of the armed forces.

The panel titled &quot;Soldiers Fighting for Democracy&quot; (Figure 4 below), shows a heroic and united armed forces doing battle (it is not clear against whom) for &quot;democracy&quot;. The panel titled &quot;Personification of the People&quot; (Figure 5 below), shows a soldier protecting the Thai people while they go about their civil pursuits. The mother with child at left is the only woman depicted anywhere at the Democracy Monument. The panel represents the view of the military regime in 1939 that the armed forces were ruling on behalf of the people.

The panel titled &quot;Personification of Balance and Good Life&quot; (Figure 6 below), represents the social ideology of the military regime. An allegorical figure representing the nation, seated in a Buddha-like posture (but not Buddha himself), holding a sword and a set of scales, representing the armed forces and justice respectively, sits in its center, flanked by figures representing (from left) sport, education, religion, and the arts. The figure of &quot;sport&quot;, a naked man with a shot put, is wholly European in origin.

==Dictatorship==

The story represented by these sculptures was a considerable distortion of the truth. In fact the 1932 coup was planned and executed almost without bloodshed by a small group of officers and some civilian collaborators, while the king was on holiday at the seaside. The coup was followed by the promulgation of Thailand&#x27;s first constitution, but this was far from fully democratic. In the mid-1930s there was an attempt to progress to full democracy, but this broke down amid a split between the military and civilian elements of the government, and by 1939, when the Democracy Monument was built, Thailand was in effect a military dictatorship.

The most striking absence from the iconography of the Monument is the monarchy, which is nowadays the focal point of Thai national life and political culture. Although the military regime paid lip service to the monarchy, its political ideology (an ultimately incompatible mix of European liberal constitutionalism and military Bonapartism) was essentially republican. Prajadhipok&#x27;s successor, Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) was at the time a schoolboy in Switzerland.
Now that Thailand is (ostensibly) a democracy, very few Thais are aware of the propaganda content of the sculptural works at the base of the Democracy Monument; because the enormous growth in the volume of Bangkok&#x27;s traffic, and the fact that pedestrian access to the traffic island on which it stands is all but impossible during periods of heavy traffic, it is difficult to observe the details of the Monument up close. There are now plans to build a tunnel under the roadway to allow better access (as has been done at the Berlin Victory Column, which is similarly located).

==Rallying point==
Despite the self-justifying intent of the Phibun regime in erecting a monument to its own seizure of power and calling it a monument to democracy, Democracy Monument&#x27;s rather dubious origins are now largely forgotten, and it has served as a rallying point for later generations of democracy activists. It was the focus of the mass student demonstrations against Thanom Kittikachorn&#x27;s military regime in the 1973 Thai popular uprising, and of the protests that triggered the 1976 military coup. During Black May (1992), scores of Thais were killed as they protested at the monument against General Suchinda Kraprayoon&#x27;s regime. During the 2013–2014 Thai political crisis, the monument was a rally point for the People&#x27;s Democratic Reform Committee led by Democrat MP Suthep Thaugsuban against Pheu Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. These events have given the monument a legitimacy it lacked for much of its history.

During the 2020 Thai protests, the monument again became a rallying point for protestors.

<text>Neu! is the debut studio album by German krautrock band Neu!, released in 1972 by Brain Records. It was the first album recorded by the duo of Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger after leaving Kraftwerk in 1971. They continued to work with producer Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank, who had also worked on the Kraftwerk recording sessions.

Upon release, the album was largely ignored internationally but did well in West Germany, selling 35,000 copies. In 2001, the album was reissued by Grönland and then licensed to Astralwerks for US distribution. In 2014, &quot;Fact&quot; named it the 36th best album of the 1970s.

== History ==
Having broken off from an early incarnation of Kraftwerk, Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger quickly began the recording sessions for what would become&quot; Neu!&quot;. The pair recorded the album across four nights in December 1971 at Star Studios in Hamburg with producer and engineer Conny Plank. Dinger noted that Plank served as a &quot;mediator&quot; between the often disagreeing factions within the band.

According to Dinger, the first two days were unproductive until he brought his taishōgoto (&quot;Japanese banjo&quot;) to the sessions, a heavily treated version of which can be heard on &quot;Negativland&quot;, the first of the album&#x27;s six tracks to be recorded. It was during these sessions that Dinger first played his famous &quot;motorik&quot; beat, as featured on &quot;Hallogallo&quot; and &quot;Negativland&quot;. Dinger claimed never to have used the term &quot;motorik&quot; himself, preferring either &quot;lange gerade&quot; (&quot;long straight&quot;) or &quot;endlose gerade&quot; (&quot;endless straight&quot;). He later changed the beat&#x27;s &quot;name&quot; to the &quot;Apache beat&quot; to coincide with his 1985 solo album &quot;Néondian&quot;.

The band was christened by Dinger (Rother had been against the name, preferring a more &quot;organic&quot; title) and a pop art style logo was created, featuring italic capitals. Dinger recalled Neu!&#x27;s logo:

== Reception ==
&quot;Neu!&quot; sold well for an underground album at the time, with approximately 35,000 copies sold in West Germany.

In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; described the album&#x27;s motorik beat as &quot;krautrock&#x27;s defining relentless rhythm&quot; and an influence on subsequent ambient music and punk. In 2008, Ben Sisario of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the album and its successors as &quot;landmarks of German experimental rock.&quot;

The track &quot;Negativland&quot; provided the name for a later group of American musical satirists.

The track &quot;Hallogallo&quot; provided the name for Hallogallo, a Chicago magazine documenting the music scene of the same name.

<text>The &quot;Beagle&quot; class (officially redesignated as the G class in 1913) was a class of sixteen destroyers of the Royal Navy, all ordered under the 1908-1909 programme and launched in 1909 and 1910. The &quot;Beagle&quot;s served during World War I, particularly during the Dardanelles Campaign of 1915.

==Design==
For the 1908–1909 shipbuilding programme, the British Admiralty decided to revert to a smaller, more affordable destroyer to follow-on from the large and fast (required to reach ) and the experimental . The destroyers needed sufficient range to operate across the North Sea in the event of a confrontation with Germany, which rendered the coastal destroyers which had been built as a low-cost supplement to the expensive Tribals outdated, requiring larger numbers of a cheaper standard destroyer. While the Tribals were oil fuelled, it was decided to return to the use of coal for the new destroyers, because of concerns over the availability of oil stocks in the event of a war and to reduce costs. They were the last British destroyers to be so fueled.

The &quot;Beagle&quot;s were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification. They were between and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of between and , with an average draught of . It was expected that the ships would displace but the builder&#x27;s designs came out heavier, at about normal and full load. Five Yarrow or White-Forster boilers fed direct-drive steam turbines driving three propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at to give a speed of . Three funnels were fitted.
The &quot;Beagle&quot; class was designed to carry a gun armament of five 12-pounder (76 mm) guns, with two mounted side by side on a raised platform on the ship&#x27;s forecastle, two on the ship&#x27;s beams, with the port gun mounted ahead of the starboard gun and one aft. While the ships were building, however, it was decided to replace the two forecastle guns by a single gun, giving a gun armament of one BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VIII and three QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns) Torpedo armament consisted of two torpedo tubes, with one between the ship&#x27;s funnels and the aft gun, and one right aft at the stern of the ship. These torpedoes had a range of at or at . Two spare torpedoes were carried.

Wartime modifications included replacement of the aft torpedo tube by a 3-pounder (47 mm) anti-aircraft gun in some ships, while depth charges were also fitted.

The &quot;Beagle&quot;s were followed, in the 1909-10 Programme, by the (later known as the H class).

==Service==
As the &quot;Beagle&quot;s completed in 1910, they joined the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Home Fleet. but in 1913 they were sent to the Mediterranean, where they formed the 5th Flotilla, remaining there on the outbreak of the First World War. They were officially redesignated the G class in October 1913 as part of a general re-designation of the Royal Navy&#x27;s destroyers. The &quot;Beagle&quot; class spent most of the war in the Mediterranean, with several taking part in the Dardanelles Campaign. Late in 1917, the ships of the class were recalled to British waters, where three ships were lost to accidents, two by running aground and one to collision.

Being coal-fired, they were obsolete by the end of the First World War and the surviving ships were all scrapped by the end of 1921.

It was reissued by Astralwerks in the US and by Grönland in the UK and Europe on 29 May 2001.

Critic Paul Morley included it in his list of the &quot;5 x 100 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003.

== Overview ==
This album further focused the classic Neu! krautrock sound, with the 11-minute &quot;Für Immer&quot; in particular being the archetypal example of their style -- a forward-driving vamping, propelled by Klaus Dinger&#x27;s drumming and Michael Rother&#x27;s layered guitar with its fluid lines and droning harmonic structure. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the album as featuring a proto-punk sound, while &quot;Fact&quot; labeled it &quot; psych-rock set to power-driven drum tracks.&quot;

Side 2 of the record caused consternation at the time. Neu! had quite simply run out of money to finish recording the album, so the second side consists entirely of their previously released single &quot;Neuschnee/Super&quot;, manipulated at various playback speeds on a record player, or mangled in a cassette recorder. Critics at the time dismissed this as a cheap gimmick and a rip-off. While it was indeed an experiment born of desperation and necessity, it was entirely in keeping with Neu!&#x27;s pop art aesthetics, taking a &quot;ready-made&quot; sound object and re-presenting it with a series of stylized manipulations, and also quite in keeping with the way Neu!&#x27;s music deconstructed and pared down the form of rock music. Dinger subsequently pointed to side 2 as being a prototype of the now ubiquitous multiple remixes which typically accompany any pop single release.

==Legacy==
Ben Sisario of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the album along with the band&#x27;s other early albums as &quot;landmarks of German experimental rock,&quot; also referred to by journalists as krautrock.

&quot;Super 16&quot; appears in the films &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.

<text>Neu! 75 is the third studio album by German krautrock band Neu!, released in February 1975 on Brain Records. It was recorded and mixed at Conny Plank&#x27;s studio between December 1974 and January 1975. The album was officially reissued on CD on 29 May 2001 by Astralwerks in the US and Grönland in the UK.

==Overview==
This album saw Neu! regroup after a few years&#x27; hiatus, during which time Michael Rother had worked with Cluster as the supergroup Harmonia. By this time, Rother and bandmate Klaus Dinger had somewhat diverged in their musical intentions for the band, with Dinger preferring a more aggressive, rock-influenced style than Rother&#x27;s ambient predilections; the two compromised, and the resulting album showcases both sounds. Side one of the record, which reflects Rother&#x27;s preferences, was recorded as a duo. On side two, Dinger switched from drums to guitar and lead vocals, with his brother Thomas and Hans Lampe double drumming. On both sides, the use of keyboards and phasing effects increased compared to the band&#x27;s earlier records. &quot;Fact&quot; described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;spartan psych-rock set to power driven drum tracks,&quot; while Thomas Jerome Seabrook identified it with &quot;kosmische Musik&quot;.

The track &quot;Hero&quot; inspired many musicians of the time, including John Lydon of the Sex Pistols, and is considered an example of proto-punk. David Bowie also alluded to the track with his album &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; and its title track. The band Negativland (named after a song on Neu!&#x27;s first album) named their record label Seeland after the song of the same name on &quot;Neu! &#x27;75&quot;.

==Reception==
In 1979, &quot;NME&quot; critic Andy Gill gave &quot;Neu! &#x27;75&quot; a perfect score. Reflecting that the band &quot;took the repetitive pulse of rock, stretched it out and wove lush, shifting layers of sound over the framework to produce a distinctive, hypnotic music which, whilst undeniably rock, was definitely outside-looking-in,&quot; he stated that this style reached its &quot;full fruition&quot; on the &quot;pivotally important&quot; album. He considered side two &quot;damn-near perfect as makes no difference, an achievement which exhausts superlatives,&quot; and the first side &quot;less immediate but only slightly less satisfying: evocative, entropic, hot-summer-daze music which balances — and is even more successfully &#x27;ambient&#x27; than — side two&#x27;s sweaty nightclub pulse&quot;.

Ben Sisario of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the album and its predecessors as &quot;landmarks of German experimental rock&quot;.

<text>Neu! 4 is the fourth and final studio album by krautrock band Neu!, released in October 1995. It was revised and re-released as Neu &#x27;86 in 2010.

== Recording ==
&quot;Neu! 4&quot; was recorded and mixed between October 1985 and April 1986 at Grundfunk Studio and Dingerland-Lilienthal Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany, and Michael Rother Studio in Forst, Germany. This was the first time Rother and Klaus Dinger had entered a studio together since 1975. However, the sessions were not completed and the planned album was abandoned.

== Release ==
During the 1990s, the first three Neu! albums were available on CD on Germanofon Records, a dubious label allegedly based in Luxembourg who specialized in unauthorized and illegal reissues of otherwise unavailable krautrock albums. Germanofon managed to get a number of their releases, including the three Neu! albums, into mainstream distribution. According to Rother&#x27;s account, Dinger released &quot;Neu! 4&quot; &quot;in an act of despair, so he says&quot; in late 1995 as a response to the bootlegs, which Dinger railed against in the liner notes. &quot;Neu! 4&quot; was issued by the Japanese label Captain Trip Records, without Rother&#x27;s input, knowledge or consent. He only learned what had happened in a telegram congratulating him on the release of the album. Rother, writing in March 2007, described this experience as &quot;a rather painful disaster between Klaus Dinger and myself&quot;.

The release of &quot;Neu! 4&quot; exacerbated the disagreements between Rother and Dinger, which prevented an official CD release of the first three Neu! albums until 2001. The 2000 agreement between Rother and Dinger which led to the CD releases on Astralwerks in the U.S. and Grönland Records in the UK and Europe called for &quot;Neu! 4&quot; to be recalled, and it has been out of print since then.

Despite Rother&#x27;s continued objection to Dinger&#x27;s original decision to release &quot;Neu! 4&quot; and his oft-stated opinion &quot;that [&quot;Neu! 4&quot;] isn&#x27;t a legal/real Neu! album&quot;, Rother had no objection to fans buying the CD secondhand and would always leave open the possibility that &quot;Neu! 4&quot; could be reissued legally with his consent in the future. Rother and Dinger did attempt to negotiate such a release after the official reissue of the first three albums. In March 2007, Rother termed the failure to reach such an agreement &quot;unfortunate&quot;. With Dinger&#x27;s death in 2008, such an agreement seemed unlikely.

== &quot;Neu! &#x27;86&quot; ==
In early 2010, Rother announced that he had arrived at an agreement arranged with Dinger&#x27;s heir, Miki Yui, and had completely remastered the album from original multitrack and master tapes to produce &quot;Neu! &#x27;86&quot;, which he termed &quot;our fourth studio album&quot;.

The new album shared several tracks in common with the original release, but contained several new or remixed tracks.

<text>Pendine Sands () is a beach on the shores of Carmarthen Bay on the south coast of Wales. It stretches west to east from Gilman Point to Laugharne Sands. The village of Pendine () is close to the western end of the beach.

In the early 1900s the sands were used as a venue for car and motor cycle races. From 1922 the annual Welsh TT motor cycle event was held here. The firm, flat surface of the beach created a race track that was straighter and smoother than many major roads of the time. &quot;Motor Cycle&quot; magazine described the sands as &quot;the finest natural speedway imaginable&quot;.

==Classic record attempts==
In the 1920s it became clear that roads and race tracks were no longer adequate venues for attempts on the world land speed record. As record-breaking speeds approached 150 mph (240 km/h), the requirements for acceleration to top speed before the measured mile and safe braking distance afterwards meant that a smooth, flat, straight surface of at least in length was needed.

The first person to use Pendine Sands for a world land speed record attempt was Malcolm Campbell. On 25 September 1924 he set a world land speed record of 146.16 mph (235.22 km/h) on Pendine Sands in his Sunbeam 350HP car &quot;Blue Bird&quot;.
Four other record-breaking runs were made on Pendine Sands between 1924 and 1927; two more by Campbell, and two by Welshman J. G. Parry-Thomas in his car &quot;Babs&quot;. Firstly the barrier was broken by Campbell. In April 1926, Parry-Thomas added approximately 20 mph to break the land speed record at 171.02 mph (273.6 km/h). Campbell raised the record to 174.22 mph (280.38 km/h) in February 1927 with his second &quot;Blue Bird&quot;. On 3 March 1927, Parry-Thomas attempted to beat Campbell&#x27;s record. On his final run while travelling at about the car crashed. There is an untrue urban myth that the exposed drive chain broke and partially decapitated him; &quot;Babs&quot; went out of control and rolled over. Parry-Thomas was the first driver to be killed in a world land speed record attempt.

One further attempt at the Land Speed Record was planned by Giulio Foresti in the &quot;Djelmo&quot;, but Foresti crashed during a test run on 26 November 1927, totally destroying the car.

In 1933, Amy Johnson and her husband, Jim Mollison, took off from Pendine Sands in a de Havilland Dragon Rapide, &quot;G-ACCV&quot; &quot;Seafarer&quot;, to fly non-stop to New York. Their aircraft ran out of fuel and was forced to crash-land at Bridgeport, Connecticut, just short of New York; both were seriously injured in the crash.

In June 2000, Donald Charles &quot;Don&quot; Wales, grandson of Sir Malcolm Campbell and a nephew of Donald Campbell, set the UK electric land speed record at Pendine Sands in &quot;Blue Bird Electric 2&quot;, achieving a speed of 137 mph (220 km/h). 

==Present day==
The Ministry of Defence (MOD) acquired Pendine Sands during the Second World War and used it as a firing range. The beach is still owned by the Ministry of Defence; prominent signs warn of the dangers of unexploded munitions and public access is restricted. From Monday to Friday part of the beach is closed off because of MOD operations. Between 9 July 2004 and May 2010 all vehicles were banned from using Pendine because of safety concerns, but since May 2010 cars have again been allowed access.
Parry-Thomas&#x27;s car was buried in the sand dunes near the village of Pendine after his accident. In 1969, Owen Wyn Owen, an engineering lecturer from Bangor Technical College, received permission to excavate &quot;Babs&quot;, which he spent the next 16 years restoring. The car could be seen on display at the Museum of Speed in Pendine village during the summer months, prior to demolition of the building for redevelopment.

In 2011, Aardman Animations claimed the world&#x27;s largest stop motion film set for Gulp, a short film. The beach was used as a &#x27;canvas&#x27; with some props and characters sculpted from the sand. The film was captured using Nokia N8, then Nokia&#x27;s top-of-the-range mobile phone. Overhead shots were obtained via a telescopic cherry picker platform on wheels. 
On 21 and 22 June 2013, Pendine Land Speed Racing Club initiated land speed racing events again on the sands.

The Vintage Hot Rod Association hosted their inaugural Amateur Hot Rod Races on Pendine Sands on 7 September 2013. Racing was open to members of the VHRA and their pre-1949 hot rods and saw 80 vehicles being timed flat out on the sands. This annual event involves participants from around the world. The event culminated in the VHRA winning a Motoring Event of the Year accolade at the International Historic Motoring Awards.

In September 2013, Guy Martin broke the UK speed record for a bicycle ridden in the slipstream of another vehicle. He hit a top speed of 112.9 mph while riding behind a modified truck driven by former British Truck Racing Championship winner, Dave Jenkins. The preparations for the record attempt were documented in Episode 1 of a Channel 4 series called &quot;Speed with Guy Martin&quot;, first broadcast in the UK in December 2013.

On 7 May 2015, actor Idris Elba broke the historic &#x27;flying mile&#x27; UK land speed record, originally set by Malcolm Campbell, in a Bentley Continental GT Speed. The recorded speed was 180.361 mph.

On 21 July 2015, at Pendine beach, the 90th anniversary of Sir Malcolm Campbell&#x27;s first world land speed record in &quot;Blue Bird&quot; was recreated by his grandson, Don Wales, also a land speed record holder, in the fully restored car. Commenting on the restoration appeal, Wales said: &quot;This beautiful car has been lovingly restored and looked after by Doug Hill and the team and it&#x27;s only right that such an iconic car deserves to have the final pieces in place to complete her!&quot;&#x27; The new gearbox will be part of a long-term project to restore the car to its 1925 specifications. This would also require the fabrication of two full-length exhaust pipes, a new seat and upholstery, and the re-manufacture of a slightly dropped nose cone and rear wheel spats.

On 12 May 2018, a home-built &#x27;wooden shed&#x27; (using an Audi RS4 twin turbo engine, installed in a metal frame with wooden shed cladding) set a new speed record, achieving , breaking its own previous record of . The following day, 45-year-old Guernsey businessman Zef Eisenberg set a new land speed &#x27;sand&#x27; record of on his 350-horsepower supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle, the first time a speed in excess of 200 miles per hour had been achieved at Pendine. This was the fastest speed achieved by a wheel powered vehicle ever at Pendine. In 2019, Eisenberg set a new record of in a modified Porsche 911. He broke the records for flying mile and flying quarter on the same day.

Pendine Sands has been used as a location for filming, including BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; and the BBC Cymru drama &quot;Keeping Faith&quot;, starring Eve Myles.

<text>Junie B. Jones is a children&#x27;s book series written by Barbara Park and illustrated by Denise Brunkus. Published by Random House from 1992 to 2013, the story centers on &quot;almost six-year-old&quot; Junie B. Jones and her adventures in kindergarten and first grade.

==Books==

Since the original book was published by Random House in 1992, a total of 31 &quot;Junie B. Jones&quot; books have been published. 28 are stories that take place in the &quot;Junie B. Jones&quot; series, and three are activity books entitled &quot;Junie B.&#x27;s Essential Survival Guide&quot;, &quot;Top-Secret Personal Beeswax: A Journal by Junie B. (and me!)&quot;, and &quot;Junie B.&#x27;s These Puzzles Hurt My Brain! Book&quot;. Several box sets, multiple book bind-ups, and a Valentine&#x27;s Day card collection have also been released. The series has been translated into Spanish, Italian and French.

==Reception==
The &quot;Junie B. Jones&quot; series came in at #71 on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Banned or Challenged Books from 2000 to 2009. Reasons cited are &quot;poor social values taught by the books, and Junie B. Jones not being considered a good role model due to her mouthiness, bad spelling, and grammar.&quot;

While Barbara Park appreciated being on banned lists with writers she respected (including Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison), she stopped reading information about her books because the comments were &quot;too hurtful.&quot; She once wrote &quot;Some people believe that the value of a children&#x27;s book can be measured only in terms of the moral lessons it tries to impose or the perfect role models it offers. Personally, I happen to think that a book is of extraordinary value if it gives the reader nothing more than a smile or two. In fact, I happen to think that&#x27;s huge.&quot;

<text>Under a Blood Red Sky is a live mini-album by Irish rock band U2, produced by Jimmy Iovine and released on 21 November 1983. The record&#x27;s eight tracks were compiled from three concerts during the group&#x27;s 1983 War Tour, including two songs from their 5 June performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. The concert film &quot;U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;, recorded at the same Red Rocks show, was released as a companion to the live album. Both releases helped establish U2&#x27;s reputation globally as a renowned live act.

==History==
The album consists of live recordings from three shows on the band&#x27;s War Tour, from Colorado and Boston in the US and from Germany.

An accompanying concert video entitled &quot;Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; was released the following year. The film was recorded entirely at the outdoor Red Rocks Amphitheatre on 5 June 1983, while two songs from that show are included on the album.

The title is taken from the lyrics of the song &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, originally released on U2&#x27;s &quot;War&quot; album.

The album was re-released on 29 September 2008 as a remastered CD with a DVD of the Red Rocks concert.

In November 2023, the band celebrated the 40th anniversary of the album with a newly remastered release on Record Store Day Black Friday.

==Track listing==

Notes&lt;br&gt;
During the performance of &quot;The Electric Co.&quot;, Bono included a 27-second snippet of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot;. When &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; was released, U2 failed to get permission and pay the appropriate licensing and royalty fees to include Sondheim&#x27;s tune on the album. When Sondheim objected, U2 agreed to pay a $50,000 (US) penalty for the unauthorized use and to press all future releases with a new version that did not include the snippet.

Essentially, there are now two versions of the vinyl album: the original with the full &quot;The Electric Co.&quot; running 5:18 and the edited version which runs 4:51. However, the various CDs pressed around the world all vary in the versions of the song that are included.

*The trifold digipack CD pressed in the U.S. correctly lists &quot;The Electric Co.&quot; at 4:51 and contains the edited version of the song.
*Later U.S. CD pressings in the standard jewel box format incorrectly list &quot;The Electric Co.&quot; at 5:18, but have the edited version of the song.
*Some, and perhaps all, European pressings of the CD correctly list &quot;The Electric Co.&quot; at 5:18 and have the unedited version of the song (the same is likely true of other worldwide CD pressings).
*An Australian pressing of the CD lists the track at 4:57, but the song actually runs the full 5:18.
*The remastered editions all contain the edited version of the song.

On the streaming platforms YouTube Music, Spotify, and Apple Music the album contains the edited version of the song.

==Personnel==
*Bono – lead vocals
*The Edge – guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, bass guitar on &quot;40&quot;
*Adam Clayton – bass guitar, guitar on &quot;40&quot;
*Larry Mullen Jr. – drums

<doc id="954216" wikidata="Q1169129" url="?curid=954216" title="Skeleton (computer programming)">
<text>Skeleton programming is a style of computer programming based on simple high-level program structures and so called dummy code. Program skeletons resemble pseudocode, but allow parsing, compilation and testing of the code. Dummy code is inserted in a program skeleton to simulate processing and avoid compilation error messages. It may involve empty function declarations, or functions that return a correct result only for a simple test case where the expected response of the code is known.

Skeleton programming facilitates a top-down design approach, where a partially functional system with complete high-level structures is designed and coded, and this system is then progressively expanded to fulfill the requirements of the project. Program skeletons are also sometimes used for high-level descriptions of algorithms. A program skeleton may also be utilized as a template that reflects syntax and structures commonly used in a wide class of problems.

Skeleton programs are utilized in the template method design pattern used in object-oriented programming. In object-oriented programming, dummy code corresponds to an abstract method, a method stub or a mock object. In the Java remote method invocation (Java RMI) nomenclature, a stub communicates on the client-side with a skeleton on the server-side.

A class skeleton is an outline of a class that is used in software engineering. It contains a description of the class&#x27;s roles, and describes the purposes of the variables and methods, but does not implement them. The class is later implemented from the skeleton. The skeleton can also be known as either an interface or an abstract class, with languages that follow a polymorphic paradigm.

== Background ==
Modern software is often complicated due to a host of reasons. This can mean that not just a single programmer can develop it, or that other modules or parts have to be separately imported. The programs can also be too complex on their own, some with multiple methods accessing a single variable at the same time or even generating pixels for displays. Skeleton code is used to assist programmers to develop their code with the fewest errors during the time of compilation.

Skeleton code is most commonly found in parallel programming, but is also applied in other situations, like documentation in programming languages. This helps to simplify the core functionality of a potentially confusing method. It can also be used to allow for a small function within a larger program to operate without full functionality temporarily.
This method of programming is easier than writing a complete function, as these skeleton functions do not have to include main functionalities and can instead be hardcoded to use during development. They usually involve syntactically correct code to introduce the method, as well as comments to indicate the operation of the program. This is not always necessary to call a piece of text skeleton code.

== Relation to pseudocode ==

Pseudocode is most commonly found when developing the structure of a new piece of software. It is a plain English portrayal of a particular function within a larger system, or can even be a representation of a whole program. Pseudocode is similar to skeleton programming, however deviates in the fact that pseudocode is primarily an informal method of programming. Dummy code is also very similar to this, where code is used simply as a placeholder, or to signify the intended existence of a method in a class or interface.

Computer programmers are extremely dependent on pseudocode, so much so that it has a measurable impact on their psyche. A typical programmer is so conditioned with the idea of writing simplified code in some manner, be it by writing pseudocode or skeleton code, or even just by drawing a diagram, that this has a measurable impact on how well they can write their final implementation. This has been found over a number of applications, with different programmers working in different languages and varied programming paradigms.

This method of program design is also most often done on pen and paper, further moving the text from what is actually to be implemented. Skeleton programming mimics this, but differs in the way that it is commonly written in an integrated development environment, or text editors. This assists the further development of the program after the initial design stage. Skeleton programs also allow for simplistic functions to operate, if run.

== Implementation ==
Skeleton programming can be implemented in a range of different programming applications.

=== Programming language documentation ===
Most, if not all programming languages have skeleton code used to assist in the definition of all built-in functions and methods. This provides a simple means for newer programmers to understand the syntax and intended implementation of the written methods.

Java, an object oriented language, focuses heavily on a structured documentation page with completely separated methods for each object part of Java&#x27;s packages. Object oriented languages focus on a hierarchy based structure to their implementations, rather than a simple top-down approach found in other languages. ‘Objects’ store data and variables in them, allowing for a typically more efficient program to be written. These objects have individual functions that can access internal variables, known as methods.

Each method is defined in the same format, with the name of the method as well as the syntax to be used in an integrated development environment clearly visible at the top of a block. With Java&#x27;s focus on scope, data types and inheritance, this syntax is extremely useful for new, if not all programmers. This is followed by an in-depth explanation of the operation of the method, with errors below.

Python has a similar approach to document its in-built methods, however mimics the language&#x27;s lack of fixation on scope and data types. This documentation has the syntax of each method, along with a short description and an example of the typical use of the method or function. The skeleton code provided in the example gives programmers a good understanding of the function at a quick glance.

=== Class definition ===
Classes written by third-party developers, primarily as a part of libraries, also showcase their programming in the form of skeleton code. This helps to inform any that are new to the library as to how the functions and methods operate. P5.Js uses this format on their documentation page to explain the intended use of certain included functions. This is different to the programming language documentation however, using skeleton code to display parameters rather than all possible uses of the method.

Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) are most typically found in situations where programmers attempt to take an input, usually colloquially termed (without the use of programming language specific jargon) and use this to create a program or a method. An implementation of this uses a small set of skeleton code to imply the function running in the background.

Other forms of NLIs use different forms of input, ranging from other users speaking different languages, to gesture based input to produce a very similar result. With programming languages being developed and written primarily in English, people speaking other languages find it hard to develop new software. NLIs have been used in some studies to assist people in these situations. The study showed classes written in Java through the use of NLIs. This removed the need for learning syntactical rules, however meant that the class was written using a basic set of skeleton code.

=== Polymorphism-based definitions ===
Polymorphism is an ideology that follows with the object oriented programming paradigm, where methods can be overridden or overloaded (methods with the same name in a child class which will take priority over a method written in a parent class). The definition of methods is based on a skeleton framework defined by the syntax of the language.

Very similar to class implementation, skeleton code can be used to define the methods that are part of an interface. An interface is essentially a blueprint of a class, which allows for strict object oriented languages (such as Java) to use classes from different packages without the need to fully understand the internal functions. Interfaces simply define the methods that have to be present within the class, allowing anyone else to use the methods or implement the class for their personal needs. 
 public skeletonExample();
An abstract class is almost the same as a class implementation, however depending on the language, at least one method is defined as abstract. This implies that any children of this class (any classes that extend or implement) need to have a method defined for this. Abstract classes have a very similar definition style to interfaces, however a keyword ‘abstract’ is typically used to identify the fact that it needs to be implemented in child classes.
 public abstract skeletonExample();
These examples use the Java syntax.

== Parallel programming ==
Parallel programming is the operation of multiple functions simultaneously most commonly used to increase efficiency. These are typically the hardest types of programs to develop, due to their complexity and interconnectedness with the hardware in question as well. Many developers have attempted to write programs with this core functionality, however this has been met by varied results.

Algorithmic skeleton frameworks are used in parallel programming to abstractly describe the methods in question for later development. The frameworks are not limited to a single type, and each of these types have different purposes to increase the efficiency of the developer&#x27;s program. These can be categorised into three main types: data-parallel, task-parallel and resolution.

=== Data-parallel ===
These skeleton algorithms are used to develop programs that work on large data based software, usually identifying the connections between data for later use. Data parallel algorithms include ‘maps’, ‘forks’ and ‘reduces’ or ‘scans’.

* ‘Maps’ are the most commonly used data parallel algorithms, and typically involve a single operation completed on a large set of data. To increase efficiency, a number of data sets have this operation applied to them simultaneously, before the data is structured together again at the end. 
* ‘Forks’ are similar to ‘maps’ but they use a different operation for certain data types. This is known as multiple data parallelism.
* ‘Reduces’ or ‘scans’ are used to apply prefixes to a set of data, before then applying an operation upon the data. These are different to ‘maps’ as they have a set of partial results during the runtime of the method itself.

=== Task-parallel ===
These operations, as their name suggests, work on tasks. Each type of algorithm under this is different due to a change in the behaviour between tasks. Task parallel algorithms include ‘sequentials’, ‘farms’, ‘pipes’, ‘if’, ‘for’ and ‘while’.

* ‘Sequential’ closes and terminates a nested set of skeleton algorithms. The methods and programs that are part of the skeletons are included as terminating aspects of the program, before closing.
* ‘Farms’ are known as a group of tasks, a worker, or as a master or slave of another function. It completes the given tasks by replicating the tasks over multiple threads and running these concurrently. This divides the load for a specific thread, effectively creating a master / slave relationship between the threads.
* ‘Pipes’ are the more traditional forms of algorithms, where each method or function is run in a sequence. This follows the order in which the programmer has written their code. This is made parallel by computing varied tasks on a set of data, typically input, simultaneously to improve performance and speed. Each simultaneous computation is known as a stage. The pipe algorithm can be nested, where one is within another, each splitting up responsibilities to increase speed and also the number of stages.
* ‘If’ gives the program a conditional split of tasks, where a set of skeleton code is split into two main sections. A conditional statement is given to the program, therefore giving it a specified algorithm to follow.
* ‘For’ operates a task a number of times, both specified by the programmer, allowing for a more efficient set of code. The number of times that the code runs is a preset value, indicating that at runtime, this cannot be changed. It must complete the task the number of times given.
* ‘While’ is an algorithm very similar to the operation of a ‘for’ algorithm, where a task is completed a number of times. However, in ‘while’ algorithms, the program computes the task a number of times before a conditional statement is met. This means that the ‘while’ algorithm can perform its task a different number of times for each time it is run.

=== Resolution skeletons ===
These skeletons are very different to the typical skeletons found above. ‘Resolution’ algorithms use a combination of methods to solve a specified problem. The algorithm&#x27;s given problem can be a “family of problems”. There are two main types of these skeletons, ‘divide and conquer’ or ‘brand and bound’.

* ‘Divide and conquer’ uses a map skeleton as its basis, combining this with a while skeleton to solve the problem. In map algorithms, functions on data are applied simultaneously. In ‘divide and conquer’ the set of data provided has a function applied to it using the map skeleton, however this can be applied recursively using the ‘while’ algorithm. The ‘while’ is only broken when the entire problem is solved. 
* ‘Branch and bound’ is an algorithm that also uses map algorithms, however instead of applying the ‘while’ algorithm to run the tasks simultaneously, this algorithm splits the tasks into branches. Each branch has a specific purpose, or ‘bound’, where the conditional statement will cause it to stop.

<doc id="954222" wikidata="Q154064" url="?curid=954222" title="Isabeau of Bavaria">
<text>Isabeau of Bavaria (or Isabelle; also Elisabeth of Bavaria-Ingolstadt; c. 1370 – 24 September 1435) was Queen of France as the wife of King Charles VI from 1385 to 1422. She was born into the House of Wittelsbach as the only daughter of Duke Stephen III of Bavaria-Ingolstadt and Taddea Visconti of Milan. At age 15 or 16, Isabella was sent to France to marry the young Charles VI; the couple wed three days after their first meeting. Isabella was honored in 1389 with a lavish coronation ceremony and entry into Paris. 

In 1392, Charles suffered the first attack of what was to become a lifelong and progressive mental illness, resulting in periodic withdrawal from government. The episodes occurred with increasing frequency, leaving a court both divided by political factions and steeped in social extravagances. A 1393 masque for one of Isabeau&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting—an event later known as &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot;—ended in disaster with Charles almost burning to death. Although the King demanded Isabeau&#x27;s removal from his presence during his illness, he consistently allowed her to act on his behalf. In this way she became regent to the Dauphin of France (heir apparent), and sat on the regency council, allowing her far more power than was usual for a medieval queen consort.

Charles&#x27; illness created a power vacuum that eventually led to the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War between supporters of his brother Louis I, Duke of Orléans, and the royal dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Bold and John the Fearless. Isabeau shifted allegiances as she chose the most favorable paths for the heir to the throne. When she followed the Armagnacs, the Burgundians accused her of adultery with the Duke of Orléans; when she sided with the Burgundians, the Armagnacs removed her from Paris and she was imprisoned. In 1407, John the Fearless assassinated Orléans, sparking hostilities between the factions. The war ended soon after Isabeau&#x27;s son Charles had John assassinated in 1419—an act that saw him disinherited. Isabeau attended the 1420 signing of the Treaty of Troyes, which decided that the English king should inherit the French crown after the death of her husband. She lived in English-occupied Paris until her death in 1435.

Isabeau was popularly seen as a spendthrift and irresponsible philanderess. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries historians re-examined the extensive chronicles of her lifetime, concluding that many unflattering elements of her reputation were unearned and stemmed from factionalism and propaganda.

== Lineage and marriage ==
Isabeau&#x27;s parents were Duke Stephen III of Bavaria-Ingolstadt and Taddea Visconti, the eldest child of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan, who turned her over to Duke Stephen for a dowry of 100,000 ducats. During this period, Bavaria was counted among the most powerful German states, divided though it was at certain times among members of the House of Wittelsbach. The Visconti family was anxious to cultivate political connections with the powerful Wittelsbachs, and three of Taddea&#x27;s siblings also married members of various branches of the family. Isabeau was most likely born in Munich, where she was baptized as Elisabeth at the Church of Our Lady. Her notable Wittelsbach ancestors included her great-grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV.

In 1383, Isabeau&#x27;s uncle, Duke Frederick of Bavaria-Landshut, suggested that she be considered as a bride for King Charles VI of France. The match was proposed again at the lavish Burgundian double wedding in Cambrai in April 1385. At this event, John, Count of Nevers (who became known as John the Fearless after he succeeded his father Philip the Bold as duke of Burgundy in 1404) married Margaret of Bavaria, whereas John&#x27;s sister, Margaret of Burgundy, married Duke William II of Bavaria-Straubing, one of the brothers of Margaret of Bavaria. Charles, then 17, rode in the tourneys at the wedding. He was an attractive, physically fit young man who enjoyed jousting and hunting and was anxious to be married.
As part of his duties as a member of the regency council that governed France during the minority of Charles VI, the king&#x27;s uncle, Philip the Bold, thought that the proposed marriage to Isabeau would be an ideal means to build an alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in opposition to the crown of England. Isabeau&#x27;s father reluctantly agreed to the plan and sent her to France with his brother Frederick on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens, whose Cathedral housed a celebrated relic of the time (the reputed head of John the Baptist). He was adamant that she was not to know that she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, as was customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 at the time of the marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.

Before her presentation to Charles, Isabeau visited Hainaut for about a month, staying with her granduncle Duke Albert I, Count of Holland, who also ruled part of the hereditary Wittelsbach territories of Bavaria-Straubing. Albert&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Brieg, had Isabeau discard her Bavarian style of dress, which would have been deemed unsuitable as courtly attire in France, and taught her etiquette suitable for the French court. She learned quickly, suggestive of an intelligent and quick-witted character. On 13 July 1385, she traveled to Amiens to be presented to Charles.

Froissart writes of the meeting in his &quot;Chronicles&quot;, saying that Isabeau stood motionless while being inspected, exhibiting perfect behavior by the standards of her time. Arrangements were made for the two to be married in Arras, but on the first meeting, Charles felt &quot;happiness and love enter his heart, for he saw that she was beautiful and young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her&quot;. She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother&#x27;s dark Italian features, which were considered unfashionable at the time. Nonetheless, Charles and Isabeau were married just three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding with jokes about the lascivious guests at the feast and the &quot;hot young couple&quot;.

Charles seemingly loved his young wife, and he lavished gifts on her. On the occasion of their first New Year in 1386, he gave her a red velvet palfrey saddle trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for &quot;Karol and Elisabeth&quot;), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, tableware and clothing. The king&#x27;s uncles were apparently also pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and Michel Pintoin (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire aroused by Isabeau&#x27;s beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles departed for a military campaign against the English, whereas Isabeau traveled to Creil to live with his step-great-grandmother, Queen Dowager Blanche, who taught her courtly traditions. In September, she took up residence at the Château de Vincennes, where, in the early years of their marriage, Charles frequently joined her. It soon became her favorite home.

== Coronation ==
Isabeau&#x27;s coronation was celebrated on 23 August 1389 with a lavish ceremonial entry into Paris. The noblewomen in the coronation procession were dressed in lavish costumes with thread-of-gold embroidery and rode in litters escorted by knights. Philip the Bold wore a doublet embroidered with 40 sheep and 40 swans, each decorated with a bell made of pearls.

The procession lasted from morning to night. The streets were lined with tableaux vivants. More than a thousand burghers stood along the route; those on one side were dressed in green facing, those on the opposite in red. The procession began at the Porte de St. Denis and passed under a canopy of sky-blue cloth beneath which children dressed as angels sang, winding into the Rue Saint-Denis before arriving at the Notre Dame for the coronation ceremony. As Tuchman describes the event, &quot;So many wonders were to be seen and admired that it was evening before the procession crossed the bridge leading to Notre Dame and the climactic display.&quot;

As Isabeau crossed the Grand Pont to Notre Dame, a person dressed as an angel descended from the church by mechanical means and &quot;passed through an opening of the hangings of blue taffeta with golden fleurs-des-lis, which covered the bridge, and put a crown on her head.&quot; The angel was then pulled back up into the church. An acrobat carrying two candles walked along a rope suspended from the spires of the cathedral to the tallest house in the city.

After Isabeau&#x27;s crowning, the procession made its way back from the cathedral along a route lit by 500 candles. They were greeted by a royal feast and a progression of narrative pageants, complete with a depiction of the Fall of Troy. Isabeau, then seven months pregnant, nearly fainted from heat on the first of the five days of festivities. To pay for the extravagant event, taxes were raised in Paris two months later.

==The illness of Charles VI==
In 1392, Charles suffered the first of what was to become a lifelong series of bouts of insanity when, on a hot August day outside Le Mans, he attacked his retinue, including his brother Orléans, killing four men. After the attack he fell into a coma that lasted four days. Few believed he would recover. His uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of his illness to seize power quickly by re-establishing themselves as regents and dissolving the so-called Marmouset council, a group of clerics and lesser nobles who had advised Charles V. The uncles of Charles VI ruled France as members of a regency council during his minority between 1380 and 1388. The Marmousets then returned as royal counselors until Charles VI became ill.

The King&#x27;s sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger and punishment and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerable 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.

Harsigny recommended a program of amusements to assist the king&#x27;s recovery. A member of the court suggested that Charles surprise Isabeau and the other ladies by joining a group of courtiers who would disguise themselves as wild men and invade the masquerade celebrating the remarriage of Isabeau&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, Catherine de Fastaverin. This came to be known as the &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot; (&quot;The Ball of the Burning Men&quot;). Charles was almost killed and four of the dancers burned to death when a spark from a torch brought by the duke of Orléans (the king&#x27;s brother) lit one of the dancer&#x27;s costumes on fire. The disaster undermined confidence in king&#x27;s capacity to rule. Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public&#x27;s outrage forced the King and the duke of Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, into offering penance for the event.

Charles suffered a second and more prolonged attack of insanity the following June; it removed him from his duties for about six months and set a pattern that would hold for the next three decades as his condition deteriorated. Froissart described the bouts of illness as so severe that the King was &quot;far out of the way; no medicine could help him&quot;, although he had recovered from the first attack within months. For the first 20 years of his illness, he experienced sustained periods of lucidity to the extent that he could continue to rule. Suggestions were made to replace him with a regent, although there was uncertainty and debate as to whether a regency could assume the full role of a living monarch. When he was incapable of ruling, his brother, the duke of Orléans, and their cousin John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy, were chief among those who sought to take control of the government.

When Charles became ill in the 1390s, Isabeau was 22; she had three children remaining to her after losing two infants (seven more would be born up to 1407, of whom only the last one failed to survive early childhood). During the worst of his illness, Charles was unable to recognize her and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, &quot;What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasions ... the king repulsed her, whispering to his people, &#x27;Who is this woman obstructing my view? Find out what she wants and stop her from annoying and bothering me. As his illness worsened at the turn of the century, she was accused of abandoning him, particularly when she moved her residence to the Hôtel Barbette. Historian Rachel Gibbons speculates that Isabeau wanted to distance herself from her husband and his illness, writing, &quot;it would be unjust to blame her if she did not want to live with a madman.&quot;

Since the King often did not recognize her during his psychotic episodes and was upset by her presence, it was eventually deemed advisable to provide him with a mistress, Odette de Champdivers, the daughter of a horse-dealer. According to Tuchman, Odette is said to have resembled Isabeau and was called &quot;the little Queen&quot;. She had probably assumed this role by 1405 with Isabeau&#x27;s consent, but during his remissions, the King still had sexual relations with his wife, whose last pregnancy occurred in 1407. Records show that Isabeau was in the King&#x27;s chamber on 23 November 1407, the night of the assassination of the duke of Orléans, and again in 1408.

The King&#x27;s bouts of illness continued unabated until his death. He and Isabeau may have still felt mutual affection, and Isabeau exchanged gifts and letters with him during his periods of lucidity, but she distanced herself during the prolonged attacks of insanity. Historian Tracy Adams writes that Isabeau&#x27;s attachment and loyalty is evident in the great efforts she made to retain the crown for his heirs in the ensuing decades.

== Court intrigues of the 1380s and 1390s ==
Isabeau&#x27;s movements and political activities are well documented after the time of her marriage, partially because of the unusual positions of power she occupied as a result of her husband&#x27;s recurring illnesses. Nevertheless, not much is known about her personal characteristics - historians even disagree about her appearance. She is variously described as &quot;small and brunette&quot; or &quot;tall and blonde&quot;; contemporaneous evidence is contradictory—chroniclers said of her either that she was &quot;beautiful and hypnotic, or so obese through dropsy that she was crippled.&quot; Despite her continuous residence in France from the time of her marriage as a teenager, she spoke with a heavy German accent that never diminished. Tuchman describes this as giving her an &quot;alien&quot; cast at the French court. Tracy Adams describes Isabeau as a talented diplomat who navigated court politics with ease, grace and charisma. 

Charles VI attained sole control of the monarchy when was crowned King in 1387 at the age of 20. His first acts included the dismissal of his uncles who had been acting as regents and the reinstatement of the so-called Marmousets—a group of clerics and lesser nobles who had served as councilors to his father, Charles V. Additionally, he gave his brother, the duke of Orléans, more responsibility in affairs of state. Some years later, after the King&#x27;s first attack of illness, tensions mounted between the duke of Orléans and the three royal uncles: Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Forced to assume a greater role in maintaining peace amidst the growing power struggle, which was to persist for many years, Isabeau succeeded in her role as peacekeeper among the various court factions.

As early as the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau demonstrated that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. The duke of Orléans, who was married to Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s daughter Valentina, formed a pro-Visconti faction at court in alliance with the Duke of Burgundy. An anti-Visconti faction formed in opposition to them that included Isabeau, her brother Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time, Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter Isabella to Richard II of England, Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with the Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.

In the 1390s, Jean Gerson, later the Chancellor of the University of Paris, formed a council to eliminate the Western Schism, and in recognition of her negotiating skills, he placed Isabeau on the council. The French wanted both the Avignon and Roman popes to abdicate in favor of a single papacy in Rome; Clement VII in Avignon welcomed Isabeau&#x27;s presence given her record as an effective mediator. However, the effort faded when Clement VII died in 1394.

During his short-lived recovery in the 1390s, Charles made arrangements for Isabeau to be &quot;principal guardian of the Dauphin&quot;, their son, until he reached 13 years of age, giving her additional political power on the regency council. Charles appointed Isabeau co-guardian of their children in 1393, a position shared with the royal dukes and her brother, Louis of Bavaria, while he gave Orléans full power of the regency. In appointing Isabeau, Charles acted under laws enacted by his father, Charles V, which gave the Queen full power to protect and educate the heir to the throne. These appointments separated power between Orléans and the royal uncles, increasing ill-will among the factions. The following year, as Charles&#x27; bouts of illness became more severe and prolonged, Isabeau became the leader of the regency council, giving her power over the royal dukes and the Constable of France, while at the same time making her vulnerable to attack from various court factions.

== Political crises in France at the start of the 15th century ==
During Charles&#x27; illness, Orléans became financially powerful as the official tax collector, and in the following decade Isabeau and Orléans agreed to raise the level of taxation. In 1401, during one of the King&#x27;s absences, Orléans installed his own men to collect royal revenues, angering Philip the Bold who in retaliation raised an army, threatening to enter Paris with 600 men-at-arms and 60 knights. At that time Isabeau intervened between Orléans and Burgundy, preventing bloodshed and the outbreak of civil war.

Charles trusted Isabeau enough by 1402 to allow her to arbitrate the growing dispute between the Orléanists and Burgundians, and he turned control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife in an attempt to gain access to the royal treasury for Burgundian interests. Orléans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his own interests and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with Orléans to protect the interests of the crown and her children. Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rank—he was cousin to the King, whereas Orléans was Charles&#x27; brother.

Rumors that Isabeau and Orléans were lovers began to circulate, a relationship that was considered incestuous. Whether the two were intimate has been questioned by contemporary historians, including Gibbons who believes the rumor may have been planted as propaganda against Isabeau as retaliation against tax increases she and Orléans ordered in 1405. An Augustinian friar, , preached a long sermon to the court denouncing excess and depravity, in particular mentioning Isabeau and her habit of wearing clothing with exposed necks, shoulders and décolletage. The monk presented his sermon as allegory so as not to offend Isabeau overtly, but he cast her and her ladies-in-waiting as &quot;furious, vengeful characters&quot;. He said to Isabeau, &quot;If you don&#x27;t believe me, go out into the city disguised as a poor woman, and you will hear what everyone is saying.&quot; Thus he accused Isabeau as having lost touch with the commoners and the court with its subjects. At about the same time, a satirical political pamphlet called &quot;Songe Veritable&quot;, now considered by historians to be pro-Burgundian propaganda, was released and widely distributed in Paris. The pamphlet hinted at the Queen&#x27;s relations with Orléans.

John the Fearless accused Isabeau and Orléans of fiscal mismanagement and again demanded money for himself, in recompense for the loss of royal revenues after his father&#x27;s death; an estimated half of Philip the Bold&#x27;s revenues had come from the French treasury. John raised a force of 1,000 knights and entered Paris in 1405. Orléans hastily retreated with Isabeau to the fortified castle of Melun, with her household and children a day or so behind. John immediately left in pursuit, intercepting the party of chaperones and royal children. He took possession of the Dauphin, and returned him to Paris under control of Burgundian forces; however, the boy&#x27;s uncle, the duke of Berry, quickly took control of the child at the orders of the Royal Council. At that time, Charles was lucid for about a month and able to help with the crisis. The incident, that came to be known as the &quot;enlèvement of the dauphin&quot;, almost caused full-scale war, but it was averted. Orléans quickly raised an army while John encouraged Parisians to revolt. They refused, claiming loyalty to the King and his son; Berry was made captain general of Paris and the city&#x27;s gates were locked. In October, Isabeau became active in mediating the dispute in response to a letter from Christine de Pizan and an ordinance from the Royal Council.

== The assassination of the Duke of Orléans and aftermath ==

In 1407, John the Fearless ordered Orléans&#x27; assassination. On 23 November, hired killers attacked the duke as he returned to his Paris residence, cut off his hand holding the horse&#x27;s reins, and &quot;hacked [him] to death with swords, axes, and wooden clubs&quot;. His body was left in a gutter. John first denied involvement in the assassination, but quickly admitted that the act was done for the Queen&#x27;s honor, claiming he acted to &quot;avenge&quot; the monarchy of the alleged adultery between Isabeau and Orléans. His royal uncles, shocked at his confession, forced him to leave Paris while the Royal Council attempted a reconciliation between the Houses of Burgundy and Orléans.

In March 1408, Jean Petit presented a lengthy and well-attended justification at the royal palace before a large courtly audience. Petit argued convincingly that in the King&#x27;s absence Orléans had become a tyrant, practiced sorcery and necromancy, was driven by greed, and had planned to commit fratricide at the &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot;. Petit then argued that John should be exonerated because he had defended the King and monarchy by assassinating Orléans. Charles, &quot;insane during the oration&quot;, was convinced by Petit&#x27;s argument and pardoned John the Fearless, only to rescind the pardon in September.

Violence again broke out after the assassination; Isabeau had troops patrol Paris and, to protect the Dauphin Louis, Duke of Guyenne, she again left the city for Melun. In August she staged an entry to Paris for the Dauphin, and early in the new year, Charles signed an ordinance giving the 13-year-old the power to rule in the Queen&#x27;s absence. During these years, Isabeau&#x27;s greatest concern was the Dauphin&#x27;s safety as she prepared him to take up the duties of the King; she formed alliances to further those aims. At this point, the Queen and her influence were still crucial to the power struggle. Physical control of Isabeau and her children became important to both parties and she was frequently forced to change sides, for which she was criticized and called unstable. She joined the Burgundians from 1409 to 1413, then switched sides to form an alliance with the Orléanists from 1413 to 1415.

At the Peace of Chartres in March 1409, John the Fearless was reinstated to the Royal Council after a public reconciliation with Orléans&#x27; son, Charles, Duke of Orléans, at Chartres Cathedral, although the feuding continued. In December that year, Isabeau bestowed the &quot;tutelle&quot; (guardianship of the Dauphin) upon John the Fearless, made him the master of Paris, and allowed him to mentor the Dauphin, after he had Jehan de Montagu, Grand Master of the King&#x27;s household, executed. At that point, the Duke essentially controlled the Dauphin and Paris and was popular in the city because of his opposition to taxes levied by Isabeau and Orléans. Isabeau&#x27;s actions with respect to John the Fearless angered the Armagnacs, who in the fall of 1410 marched to Paris to &quot;rescue&quot; the Dauphin from the Duke&#x27;s influence. At that time, members of the University of Paris, Jean Gerson in particular, proposed that all feuding members of the Royal Council step down and be immediately removed from power.

To defuse tension with the Burgundians, a second double marriage was arranged in 1409. Isabeau&#x27;s daughter Michelle married Philip the Good, son of John the Fearless; Isabeau&#x27;s son, the Dauphin Louis, married John&#x27;s daughter Margaret. Before the wedding, Isabeau negotiated a treaty with John the Fearless in which she clearly defined family hierarchy and her position in relation to the throne.

== Civil war ==
Despite Isabeau&#x27;s efforts to keep the peace, the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War broke out in 1411. John gained the upper hand during the first year, but the Dauphin began to build a power base; Christine de Pizan wrote of him that he was the savior of France. Still only 15, he lacked the power or backing to defeat John, who fomented revolt in Paris. In retaliation against the actions of John the Fearless, Charles of Orléans denied funds from the royal treasury to all members of the royal family. In 1414, instead of allowing her son, then 17, to lead, Isabeau allied herself with Charles of Orléans. The Dauphin, in return, changed allegiance and joined John, which Isabeau considered unwise and dangerous. The result was continued civil war in Paris. Parisian commoners joined forces with John the Fearless in the Cabochien Revolt, and at the height of the revolt, a group of butchers entered Isabeau&#x27;s home in search of traitors, arresting and taking away up to 15 of her ladies-in-waiting. In his chronicles, Pintoin wrote that Isabeau was firmly allied with the Orléanists and the 60,000 Armagnacs who invaded Paris and Picardy.

King Henry V of England took advantage of the internal strife in France, invading the northwest coast, and in 1415, he delivered a crushing defeat to the French at Agincourt. Nearly an entire generation of military leaders died or were taken prisoner in a single day. John, still feuding with the royal family and the Armagnacs, remained neutral as Henry V went on to conquer towns in northern France.

In December 1415, Dauphin Louis died suddenly at age 18 of illness, leaving Isabeau&#x27;s political status unclear. Her 17-year-old fourth-born son, John of Touraine, now the Dauphin, had been raised since childhood in the household of Duke William II of Bavaria in Hainaut. Married to Countess Jacqueline of Hainaut, Dauphin John was a Burgundian sympathizer. William of Bavaria refused to send him to Paris during a period of upheaval as Burgundians plundered the city and Parisians revolted against another wave of tax increases initiated by Count Bernard VII of Armagnac; in a period of lucidity, Charles had raised the Count to be the Constable of France. Isabeau attempted to intervene by arranging a meeting with Jacqueline in 1416, but Armagnac refused to allow Isabeau to reconcile with the House of Burgundy, while William II continued to prevent the young Dauphin from entering Paris.

In 1417, Henry V invaded Normandy with 40,000 men. Later that year, in April, Dauphin John died and another shift in power occurred when Isabeau&#x27;s sixth and last son, Charles, age 14, became Dauphin. He was betrothed to Armagnac&#x27;s daughter Marie of Anjou and favored the Armagnacs. At that time, Armagnac imprisoned Isabeau in Tours, confiscating her personal property (clothing, jewels and money), dismantling her household, and separating her from the younger children as well as her ladies-in-waiting. She secured her freedom in November with the help of the Duke of Burgundy. Accounts of her release vary: Monstrelet writes that Burgundy &quot;delivered&quot; her to Troyes, and Pintoin that the Duke negotiated Isabeau&#x27;s release to gain control of her authority. Isabeau maintained her alliance with Burgundy from that period until the Treaty of Troyes in 1420.

Isabeau at first assumed the role of sole regent but in January 1418 yielded her position to John the Fearless. Together Isabeau and John abolished parliament (&quot;Chambre des comptes&quot;) and turned to securing control of Paris and the King. John took control of Paris by force on 28 May 1418, slaughtering Armagnacs. The Dauphin fled the city. According to Pintoin&#x27;s chronicle, the Dauphin refused Isabeau&#x27;s invitation to join her in an entry to Paris. She entered the city with John on 14 July.

Shortly after he assumed the title of Dauphin, Charles negotiated a truce with John in Pouilly. Charles then requested a private meeting with John, on 10 September 1419 at a bridge in Montereau, promising his personal guarantee of protection. The meeting, however, was a ploy to assassinate John, whom Charles &quot;hacked to death&quot; on the bridge. His father, King Charles, immediately disinherited his son. The civil war ended after John&#x27;s death. The Dauphin&#x27;s actions fueled more rumor about his legitimacy, and his disinheritance set the stage for the Treaty of Troyes.
== The Treaty of Troyes and Isabeau&#x27;s later years ==
By 1419, Henry V had occupied much of Normandy and demanded an oath of allegiance from the residents. The new Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, allied with the English, putting enormous pressure on France and Isabeau, who remained loyal to the King. In 1420, Henry sent an emissary to confer with the Queen, after which, according to Adams, Isabeau &quot;ceded to what must have been a persuasively posed argument by Henry V&#x27;s messenger&quot;. France had effectively been left without an heir to the throne, even before the Treaty of Troyes. Charles VI had disinherited the Dauphin, whom he considered responsible for &quot;breaking the peace for his involvement in the assassination of the duke of Burgundy&quot;; he wrote in 1420 of the Dauphin that he had &quot;rendered himself unworthy to succeed to the throne or any other title&quot;. Charles of Orléans, next in line as heir under Salic law, had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Agincourt and was kept in captivity in London.

In the absence of an official heir to the throne, Isabeau accompanied King Charles to sign the Treaty of Troyes in May 1420. Gibbons writes that the treaty &quot;only confirmed [the Dauphin&#x27;s] outlaw status.&quot; The King&#x27;s illness prevented him from appearing at the signing of the treaty, forcing Isabeau to stand in for him; which, according to Gibbons, gave her &quot;perpetual responsibility in having sworn away France&quot;. For many centuries, Isabeau stood accused of relinquishing the crown because of the Treaty. Under the terms of the Treaty, Charles remained as King of France but Henry V, who married Charles&#x27; and Isabeau&#x27;s daughter, Catherine, was allowed to keep control of the territories he conquered in Normandy and was to be Charles&#x27; successor, governing France with the Duke of Burgundy. Isabeau was to live in English-controlled Paris.

Charles VI died in October 1422. As Henry V had died earlier the same year, his infant son by Catherine, Henry VI, was proclaimed King of France according to the terms of the Treaty of Troyes, with the Duke of Bedford acting as regent. Rumors circulated about Isabeau again; some chronicles describe her living in a &quot;degraded state&quot;. According to Tuchman, Isabeau had a farmhouse built in St. Ouen where she looked after livestock, and in her later years, during a lucid episode, Charles arrested one of her lovers whom he tortured, then drowned in the Seine. Desmond Seward writes it was the disinherited Dauphin who had the man killed. Described as a former lover of Isabeau as well as a &quot;poisoner and wife-murderer&quot;, Charles kept him as a favorite at his court until ordering his drowning.

Rumors about Isabeau&#x27;s promiscuity flourished, which Adams attributes to English propaganda intended to secure England&#x27;s grasp on the throne. An allegorical pamphlet, called &quot;Pastorelet&quot;, was published in the mid-1420s painting Isabeau and Orleans as lovers. During the same period, Isabeau was contrasted with Joan of Arc, considered virginally pure, in the allegedly popular saying &quot;Even as France had been lost by a woman it would be saved by a woman&quot;. Adams writes that Joan of Arc has been attributed with the words &quot;France, having been lost by a woman, would be restored by a virgin&quot;, but neither saying can be substantiated by contemporary documentation or chronicles.

In 1429, when Isabeau lived in English-occupied Paris, the accusation was again put forth that Charles VII was not the son of Charles VI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young Henry VI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda to prop up the English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans&#x27; illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans&#x27; assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau&#x27;s reputation of one of history&#x27;s great villains.

Isabeau was removed from political influence and retired to live in the Hôtel Saint-Pol with her brother&#x27;s second wife, Catherine of Alençon. She was accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting Amelie von Orthenburg and Madame de Moy, the latter of whom had traveled from Germany and had stayed with her as &quot;dame d&#x27;honneur&quot; since 1409. Isabeau possibly died there in late September 1435. Her death and funeral were documented by Jean Chartier (member of St Denis Abbey), who may well have been an eyewitness.

== Reputation and legacy ==
Isabeau was dismissed by historians in the past as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now see her as taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility as a direct result of Charles&#x27; illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen&#x27;s duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.

Rumored to be a bad mother, she was accused of &quot;incest, moral corruption, treason, avarice and profligacy ... political aspirations and involvements&quot;. Adams writes that historians reassessed her reputation in the late 20th century, exonerating her of many of the accusations, seen particularly in Gibbons&#x27; scholarship. Furthermore, Adams admits she believed the allegations against Isabeau until she delved into contemporary chronicles: there she found little evidence against the Queen except that many of the rumors came from only a few passages, and in particular from Pintoin&#x27;s pro-Burgundian writing.

After the onset of the King&#x27;s illness, a common belief was that Charles&#x27; mental illness and inability to rule were due to Isabeau&#x27;s witchcraft; as early as the 1380s, rumors spread that the court was steeped in sorcery. In 1397 Orléans&#x27; wife, Valentina Visconti, was forced to leave Paris because she was accused of using magic. The court of the &quot;mad king&quot; attracted magicians with promises of cures who were often used as political tools by the various factions. Lists of people accused of bewitching Charles were compiled, with Isabeau and Orléans both listed.

The accusations of adultery were rampant. According to Pintoin&#x27;s chronicle, &quot;[Orléans] clung a bit too closely to his sister-in-law, the young and pretty Isabeau of Bavaria, the queen. This ardent brunette was twenty-two; her husband was insane and her seductive brother-in-law loved to dance, beyond that we can imagine all sorts of things&quot;. Pintoin said of the Queen and Orléans that they neglected Charles, behaved scandalously and &quot;lived on the delights of the flesh&quot;, spending large amounts of money on court entertainment. The alleged affair, however, is based on a single paragraph from Pintoin&#x27;s chronicles, according to Adams, and is no longer considered proof.

Isabeau was accused of indulging in extravagant and expensive fashions, jewel-laden dresses and elaborate braided hairstyles coiled into tall shells, covered with wide double hennins that, reportedly, required widened doorways to pass through. In 1406, a pro-Burgundian satirical pamphlet in verse allegory listed Isabeau&#x27;s supposed lovers. She was accused of leading France into a civil war because of her inability to support a single faction; she was described as an &quot;empty headed&quot; German; of her children, it was said that she &quot;took pleasure in a new pregnancy only insofar as it offered her new gifts&quot;; and her political mistakes were attributed to her being fat.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, historians characterized Isabeau as &quot;an adulterous, luxurious, meddlesome, scheming, and spendthrift queen&quot;, overlooking her political achievements and influence. A popular book written by Louise de Karalio (1758–1822) about the &quot;bad&quot; French queens prior to Marie Antoinette is, according to Adams, where &quot;Isabeau&#x27;s black legend attains its full expression in a violent attack on the French royalty in general and queens in particular.&quot; Karalio wrote: &quot;Isabeau was raised by the furies to bring about the ruin of the state and to sell it to its enemies; Isabeau of Bavaria appeared, and her marriage, celebrated in Amiens on 17 July 1385, would be regarded as the most horrifying moment in our history&quot;. Isabeau was painted as Orléans&#x27; passionate lover, and the inspiration for the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s unpublished 1813 novel &quot;Histoire secrète d&#x27;Isabelle de Bavière, reine de France&quot;, about which Adams writes, &quot;submitting the queen to his ideology of gallantry, [the Marquis de Sade] gives her rapaciousness a cold and calculating violence ... a woman who carefully manages her greed for maximum gratification.&quot; She goes on to say that de Sade admitted to &quot;being perfectly aware that the charges against the queen are without ground.&quot;

== Patronage ==
Like many of the Valois, Isabeau was an appreciative art collector. She loved jewels and was responsible for the commissions of particularly lavish pieces of &quot;ronde-bosse&quot; — a newly developed technique of making enamel-covered gold pieces. Documentation suggests she commissioned several fine pieces of &quot;tableaux d&#x27;or&quot; from Parisian goldsmiths.
In 1404, Isabeau gave Charles a spectacular &quot;ronde-bosse&quot;, known as the &quot;Little Golden Horse Shrine&quot;, (or &quot;Goldenes Rössl&quot;), now part of the treasure of the Marian shrine of Altötting, Bavaria. Contemporary documents identify the statuette as a New Year&#x27;s gift—an &quot;étrennes&quot;—a Roman custom Charles revived to establish rank and alliances during the period of factionalism and war. With the exception of manuscripts, the Little Golden Horse is the single surviving documented &quot;étrennes&quot; of the period. Weighing , the gold piece is encrusted with rubies, sapphires and pearls. It depicts Charles kneeling on a platform above a double set of stairs, presenting himself to the Virgin Mary and child Jesus, who are attended by John the Evangelist and John the Baptist. A jewel encrusted trellis or bower is above; beneath stands a squire holding the golden horse. Isabeau also exchanged New Year&#x27;s gifts with the Duke of Berry; one extant piece is the &quot;ronde-bosse&quot; statuette Saint Catherine.

Medieval author Christine de Pizan solicited the Queen&#x27;s patronage at least three times. In 1402, she sent a compilation of her literary argument &quot;Querelle du Roman de la Rose&quot;—in which she questions the concept of courtly love—with a letter exclaiming &quot;I am firmly convinced the feminine cause is worthy of defense. This I do here and have done with my other works.&quot; In 1410 and again in 1411, Pizan solicited the Queen, presenting her in 1414 an illuminated copy of her works. In &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot;, Pizan praised Isabeau lavishly, and again in the illuminated collection, &quot;The Letter of Othea&quot;, which scholar Karen Green believes for de Pizan is &quot;the culmination of fifteen years of service during which Christine formulated an ideology that supported Isabeau&#x27;s right to rule as regent in this time of crisis.&quot;

Isabeau showed great piety, essential for a queen of her period. During her lifetime, and in her will, she bequeathed property and personal possessions to Notre Dame, St. Denis, and the convent in Poissy.

== Children ==
The birth of each of Isabeau&#x27;s 12 children is well chronicled; even the decoration schemes of the rooms in which she gave birth are described. She had six sons and six daughters. The first son, born in 1386, died as an infant and the last, Philip, born in 1407, lived a single day. Three others died young with only her youngest son, Charles VII, living to adulthood. Five of the six daughters survived; four were married and one, Marie (1393–1438), was sent at age four to be raised in a convent, where she became prioress.

Her first son, Charles (b. 1386), the first Dauphin, died in infancy. A daughter, Joan, born two years later, lived until 1390. The second daughter, Isabella (1389-1409) was married at age seven to Richard II of England and after his death to Charles, Duke of Orléans. The third daughter, another Joan (1391–1433), who lived to age 42, married John VI, Duke of Brittany. The fourth daughter, Michelle (1395–1422), first wife to Philip the Good, died childless at age 27. Catherine of Valois, Queen of England (1401–1437), married Henry V of England; on his death she took Sir Owen Tudor as her second husband.

Of her remaining sons, the second Dauphin was another Charles (1392–1401), who died at age eight of a &quot;wasting illness&quot;. Louis, Duke of Guyenne (1397-1415), was the third Dauphin, married to Margaret of Nevers, who died at age 18. John, Duke of Touraine (1398-1417), the fourth Dauphin, the first husband of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut, died without issue, also at the age of 18. The fifth Dauphin, yet another Charles (1403-1461), became King Charles VII of France after his father&#x27;s death. He was married to Marie of Anjou. Her last son, Philip, died in infancy in the year 1407.

According to modern historians, Isabeau stayed in close proximity to the children during their childhood, had them travel with her, bought them gifts, wrote letters, bought devotional texts, and arranged for her daughters to be educated. She resisted separation and reacted against having her sons sent to other households to live (as was the custom at the time). Pintoin records that she was dismayed at the marriage contract that stipulated her third surviving son, John, be sent to live in Hainaut. She maintained relationships with her daughters after their marriages, writing letters to them frequently. She sent them out of Paris during an outbreak of plague, staying behind herself with the youngest infant, John, too young to travel. The Celestines allowed &quot;whenever and as often as she liked, she and her children could enter the monastery and church ... their vineyards and gardens, both for devotion and for entertainment and pleasure of herself and her children.&quot;

<text>Leonid Mikhailovich Roshal (; born April 27, 1933) is a noted pediatrician from Moscow, Russia, expert for the World Health Organization, and chairman of International Charity Fund to Help Children in Disasters and Wars.

==Biography==
Roshal was born in the город of Livny, Oryol Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. His mother, Emma, came from a Jewish family in what is today Ukraine. His father, Mikhail, was a fighter jet pilot.

Roshal has been leading the Emergency Surgery &amp; Children&#x27;s Trauma Department of Moscow&#x27;s Pediatric Scientific Research Institute since 1981. In 1988, he traveled to Armenia during the earthquake to provide relief to the population. In 2003, he also took over the Moscow Institute of Emergency Children&#x27;s Surgery &amp; Traumatology, which is currently treating 60,000 children a year.

Roshal negotiated with Chechen terrorists during the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002. He also served as a negotiator in the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis, working for the release of children and trying to convince the hostage-takers to allow the hostages to have food and water. After the events in the Beslan crisis played out, he also served as the advisor to the medical teams that had to treat burn wounds on hundreds of children.

Since 2005 he is a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. He is also a member of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights.

==Views==
Roshal publicly spoke out against the war in Chechnya and the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In February 2006 he criticized the Mothers of Beslan for &quot;judging the state rather than the terrorists&quot; at a trial of one of the Beslan hostage takers.

Roshal is a supporter of Vladimir Putin and his policies. Since 2013, he has been a member of the central headquarters of the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front, a right-wing political coalition led by Putin. In 2020, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny&#x27;s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, characterized Roshal as &quot;little more than a stooge&quot; for Putin. On February 25, 2023, the European Union imposed sanctions against Roshal due to his co-chairmanship of the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front, which provides support for Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine, and his personal statements in support of the military action against Ukraine.

Roshal is outspoken anti-gay. In 2013, during press conference answering the question about his views on the Russian gay propaganda law discussed by the Russian parliament back then he said &quot;I&#x27;ll be short: I hate gays and everything about it&quot;.

<doc id="954231" wikidata="Q988151" url="?curid=954231" title="Cuspy halo problem">
<text>The cuspy halo problem (also known as the core-cusp problem) is a discrepancy between the inferred dark matter density profiles of low-mass galaxies and the density profiles predicted by cosmological N-body simulations. Nearly all simulations form dark matter halos which have &quot;cuspy&quot; dark matter distributions, with density increasing steeply at small radii, while the rotation curves of most observed dwarf galaxies suggest that they have flat central dark matter density profiles (&quot;cores&quot;).

Several possible solutions to the core-cusp problem have been proposed. Many recent studies have shown that including baryonic feedback (particularly feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei) can &quot;flatten out&quot; the core of a galaxy&#x27;s dark matter profile, since feedback-driven gas outflows produce a time-varying gravitational potential that transfers energy to the orbits of the collisionless dark matter particles. Other works have shown that the core-cusp problem can be solved outside of the most widely accepted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm: simulations with warm or self-interacting dark matter also produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies. It is also possible that the distribution of dark matter that minimizes the system energy has a flat central dark matter density profile.

==Simulation results==

According to W.J.G. de Blok &quot;The presence of a cusp in the centers of CDM halos is one of the earliest and strongest results derived from N-body cosmological simulations.&quot; Numerical simulations for CDM structure formation predict some structure properties that conflict with astronomical observations.

==Observations==

The discrepancies range from galaxies to clusters of galaxies. &quot;The main one that has attracted a lot of attention is the cuspy halo problem, namely that CDM models predict halos that have a high density core or have an inner profile that is too steep compared to observations.&quot;

==Potential solutions==

The conflict between numerical simulations and astronomical observations creates numerical constraints related to the core/cusp problem. Observational constraints on halo concentrations imply the existence of theoretical constraints on cosmological parameters. According to McGaugh, Barker, and de Blok, there might be 3 basic possibilities for interpreting the halo concentration limits stated by them or anyone else:
#&quot;CDM halos must have cusps, so the stated limits hold and provide new constraints on cosmological parameters.&quot;
#&quot;Something (e.g. feedback, modifications of the nature of dark matter) eliminates cusps and thus the constraints on cosmology.&quot;
# &quot;The picture of halo formation suggested by CDM simulations is wrong.&quot;

One approach to solving the cusp-core problem in galactic halos is to consider models that modify the nature of dark matter; theorists have considered warm, fuzzy, self-interacting, and meta-cold dark matter, among other possibilities. One straightforward solution could be that the distribution of dark matter that minimizes the system energy has a flat central dark matter density profile.

<doc id="954234" wikidata="Q3406262" url="?curid=954234" title="Dwarf galaxy problem">
<text>The dwarf galaxy problem, also known as the missing satellites problem, arises from a mismatch between observed dwarf galaxy numbers and collisionless numerical cosmological simulations that predict the evolution of the distribution of matter in the universe. In simulations, dark matter clusters hierarchically, in ever increasing numbers of halo &quot;blobs&quot; as halos&#x27; components&#x27; sizes become smaller-and-smaller. However, although there seem to be enough observed normal-sized galaxies to match the simulated distribution of dark matter halos of comparable mass, the number of observed dwarf galaxies is orders of magnitude lower than expected from such simulation. Recent observations suggest that this problem may be resolved for the Milky Way galaxy but same simulations show that the problem of too few satellites persists in other galaxies.

==Context==
For example, around 38 dwarf galaxies have been observed in the Local Group, and only around 11 orbiting the Milky Way, yet dark matter simulations predict that there should be around 500 dwarf satellites for the Milky Way alone. 

The dwarf galaxy problem still persists, but now there are too many instead of too few. Based on current simulations there should be around 220 satellite galaxies in the Milky Way, however recent discoveries in 2024 point the number to be around at least 500 satellites. The recently constructed Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be conducting wide field surveys of the night skies, leading to discoveries which may help scientists better understand this issue. While the problem may have been resolved for the Milky Way when taking the Luminosity function (astronomy) into account, for some early-type galaxies fewer galaxies are being observed than the number predicted by simulations. The problem of finding too many galaxies may lie in the simulations used. This implies that simulations still need to be improved upon in order to solve the dwarf galaxy problem, not just for the Milky Way but for other galaxies. 

==Prospective resolution==
There are two main alternatives which may resolve the dwarf galaxy problem: The smaller-sized clumps of dark matter may be unable to obtain or retain the baryonic matter needed to form stars in the first place; or, after they form, dwarf galaxies may be quickly “eaten” by the larger galaxies that they orbit.

===Baryonic matter too sparse===
One proposal is that the smaller halos do exist but that only a few of them end up becoming visible, because they are unable to acquire enough baryonic matter to form a visible dwarf galaxy. In support of this, in 2007 the Keck telescopes observed eight newly discovered ultra-faint Milky Way dwarf satellites of which six were around 99.9% dark matter (with a mass-to-light ratio of about 1,000). Recent density profiles from 2022 suggest that dwarf galaxies have a constant-density core, though Dark matter simulations suggest that there should be less baryon density. 

===Early demise of young dwarfs===
The other popular proposed solution is that dwarf galaxies may tend to merge into the galaxies they orbit shortly after star-formation, or to be quickly torn apart and tidally stripped by larger galaxies, due to complicated orbital interactions.

Tidal stripping may also have been part of the problem of detecting dwarf galaxies in the first place: Finding dwarf galaxies is an extremely difficult task, since they tend to have low surface brightness and are highly diffuse – so much so that they are close to blending into background and foreground stars.

<doc id="954235" wikidata="Q2093993" url="?curid=954235" title="Aran jumper">
<text>The Aran jumper (Irish: &quot;Geansaí Árann&quot;), also called a fisherman&#x27;s jumper or a gansey, is a style of jumper that takes its name from the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. A traditional Aran Jumper usually is off-white in colour, with cable patterns on the body and sleeves. Originally the jumpers were knitted using unscoured wool that retained its natural oils (lanolin) which made the garments water-resistant and meant they remained wearable even when wet.

Use of the word jumper (or other options such as &quot;pullover&quot; and &quot;jersey&quot;) is largely determined by the regional version of English used. In the case of Ireland, Britain and Australia, &quot;jumper&quot; is the standard word, &quot;jersey&quot; is used in South Africa and New Zealand, whereas &quot;sweater&quot; is mainly found in tourist shops and in North America. The word used in Irish is &quot;&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Traditionally, an Aran jumper is made from undyed cream-coloured &quot;&quot; (pronounced &quot;bawneen&quot;), a yarn made from sheep&#x27;s wool, sometimes &quot;black-sheep&quot; wool. They were originally made with unwashed wool that still contained natural sheep lanolin, making the garment water-repellent.

The jumper usually features 4–6 texture patterns each of which is about in width, that move down the jumper in columns from top to bottom. Usually, the patterns are symmetrical to a centre axis extending down the centre of the front and back panel. The patterns also usually extend down the sleeves as well. The same textured knitting is also used to make socks, hats, vests, and skirts.

==History==
There is debate about when island residents first started making the jumpers. Some stitch patterns are believed, erroneously, to have a traditional interpretation, often of religious significance. These interpretations were fabricated by Heinz Edgar Kiewe, a yarn shop owner who noticed a chance resemblance between Aran stitches and Celtic knotwork, and assumed that Aran knitting was at least as old as, if not older than, the knotwork it resembles. He wrote a book on his suppositions, &quot;The Sacred History of Knitting&quot;, which provides most of the mythology surrounding the Aran jumper. His thesis has, however, been thoroughly debunked by many historians of knitting, including Richard Rutt, Alice Starmore and Vawn Corrigan.

Most historians agree that far from being an ancient craft, Aran knitting was invented as recently as the 1890s and early 1900s, when the Congested Districts Board sought to improve the fishing industry in the Islands. Fishermen and their wives from other regions in Britain and Ireland came to help train the islanders in better fishing and fish-processing skills, bringing with them an existing tradition of knitted guernsey jumpers. These guernsey jumpers have similar stitch patterns, though usually only on the yoke, and are worked in fine wool not available to the Aran Islanders. Enterprising local women began knitting their own version, using thicker local wool, all-over patterning, and different construction such as saddle shoulders, rather than the more usual gusseted drop sleeve. Vawn Corrigan dates the adult Aran gansey as we know it today to 1932 when the first one was commissioned by social reformer Muriel Gahan.

The first commercially available Aran knitting patterns were published in the 1940s by Patons of England. &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine carried articles on the garment in the 1950s, and jumper exports from the west of Ireland to the United States began in the early 1950s. Standun in Spiddal, Co.Galway was the first to export the Aran sweater to the USA. This provided employment for women throughout Ireland. May &amp; Mairtin Standun employed over 700 knitters throughout the country and many people relied on them as a source of income. The Standuns were great friends with The Clancy Brothers and Luke Kelly, and they would often wear Aran sweaters from Standun&#x27;s.

The development of the export trade during the 1950s and 1960s took place after P. A. Ó Síocháin organised an instructor, with the help of a grant from the Congested Districts Board for Ireland, to go to the islands and teach the knitters how to make garments to standard international sizings. He commissioned the Irish artist Seán Keating, who had spent much time on the islands, to design and illustrate marketing brochures. Knitting became an important part of the islands&#x27; economy. Adding to the popularity of the Aran jumpers were The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, an Irish folk music group which started recording in New York City in the late 1950s and who adopted the Arans as their trademark on-stage garments. In the early 1960s they appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and even in a special televised performance for US president John F. Kennedy. The national exposure and the rising popularity of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem fuelled the demand for Aran jumpers even more. During the 1960s, even with all available knitters recruited from the three islands and from other parts of Ireland, Ó Síocháin had difficulty in fulfilling orders from around the world. At the height of the fashion for Arans, the knitwear even inspired the British and French fashion scenes: Dublin-born London designer, Digby Morton (1906–83) featured Aran-&quot;inspired&quot; handknits for the first time in his 1955 autumn show in London, and by 1960, the Irish Times fashion editor was noting that the Irish hand-knit look was influencing Paris couture woollens. The Aran jumper had a fashion moment in July 2020, when Taylor Swift wore the garment in a photo-shoot that accompanied the release of her album, &quot;Folklore&quot;.

===Myths===

Part of the appeal and popularity of Aran Jumper comes from the array of myths propagated by Heinz Edgar Kiewe:
# The moss stitch is said to signify an abundance of growth.
# The blackberry stitch represents nature. 
# The honeycomb is a said to be a lucky stitch, signifying plenty.
# Lattice or basket stitches to represent the old wicker basket patterns. 
# The Ladder of Life and Tree of Life represent the stages of life.

It is sometimes said that each islander (or his family) had a jumper with a unique design, so that if he drowned and was found, maybe weeks later, on the beach, his body could be identified. This misconception may have originated with John Millington Synge&#x27;s 1904 play &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot;, in which the body of a dead Islander is identified by his hand-knitted socks. However, even in the play, there is no reference to any decorative or Aran-type pattern. The socks are identified by the number of stitches, the quote being &quot;it&#x27;s the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three score stitches, and I dropped four of them&quot;.

== Aran production today ==

While in the past, the majority of jumpers and other Aran garments were knitted by hand, today the majority of items for sale in Ireland and elsewhere are either machine knitted or produced on a hand loom. There are very few people still knitting jumpers by hand on a commercial basis but hand knitted jumpers are still available at local craft initiatives.

Machine knitted jumpers tend to use finer wool, cotton, or synthetic yarn and have less complex patterns, since many of the traditional stitches cannot be reproduced this way. They are generally flatter, lighter and less substantial, without the pronounced texture of a hand knitted or hand loomed jumper. Machine knitted jumpers will loosen with wear, and so it is advisable to buy one size smaller than the size of the sweater usually worn. They are the least expensive option. Hand-looming allows more complicated stitches to be used, will have fewer stitches to the inch and be thicker. The best quality hand-loomed jumpers are almost indistinguishable from hand knit. Hand knitted jumpers tend to be more tightly knitted, to have more complex stitch patterns and to be longer-lasting and they attract a significant price premium. By holding them up to light, the difference between the machine knit and hand knit is evident.

<doc id="954247" wikidata="Q1860162" url="?curid=954247" title="Treaty of Limerick">
<text>The Treaty of Limerick (), signed on 3 October 1691, ended the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland, a conflict related to the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years&#x27; War. It consisted of two separate agreements, one with military terms of surrender, signed by commanders of a French expeditionary force and Irish Jacobites loyal to the exiled James II. Baron de Ginkell, leader of government forces in Ireland, signed on behalf of William III and his wife Mary II. It allowed Jacobite units to be transported to France, the diaspora known as the Flight of the Wild Geese.

The other set out conditions for those who remained, including guarantees of religious freedom for Catholics, and retention of property for those who remained in Ireland. Many were subsequently altered or ignored, establishing the Protestant Ascendancy that dominated Ireland until the Catholic emancipation in the first half of the 19th century.

==Background==

William&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Boyne in July 1690 was less decisive than appeared at the time, Jacobite losses being around 2,000 out of a force of 25,000. That assumption formed the basis of the Declaration of Finglas, largely dictated by Irish Protestants; it offered the Jacobite rank and file amnesty, but by excluding senior officers, threatened another round of land confiscations. The war continued, with French victories in the Low Countries briefly increasing hopes of a Stuart restoration.

The Jacobites established a defensive line along the Shannon, and repulsed attempts to capture Limerick and Athlone. However, Connacht and County Kerry could not feed an additional 20,000 soldiers, plus refugees, while the loss of the south-western ports of Kinsale and Cork made resupply from France extremely difficult. By the spring of 1691, both soldiers and civilians were starving.

Although the English Parliament was divided politically, all parties broadly agreed on the need to re-establishing the pre-1685 settlement. In fact, Parliament wanted more resources dedicated to Ireland than William, who viewed it as secondary to the war in Europe. In 1691, French preparations for an offensive in the Low Countries led William to authorise De Ginkell to offer whatever terms were necessary to make peace. This caused much conflict later on.

Jacobite strategy was impacted by internal divisions. James II saw Ireland as a distraction, a perspective shared by many of the English and Scots exiles. For the French, it was a way to divert Williamite resources, and their approach was purely military. After the Boyne, they recommended Dublin be destroyed, and argued Limerick should not be defended; they withdrew to Galway in September 1690, and many of their troops returned to France.

The Irish Jacobites were broadly divided into a pro-war faction, headed by Sarsfield, who argued military victory was still possible, and those led by Tyrconnell, who advocated negotiating peace while they still retained an army. In May, a French convoy reached Limerick with additional French troops, arms and provisions but lack of transport meant most of it remained in the port.

==Military articles==
These articles dealt with the treatment of the disbanded Jacobite army. Under the treaty, Jacobite soldiers in formed regiments had the option to leave with their arms and flags for France to continue serving under James II in the Irish Brigade. Some 14,000 Jacobites chose this option and were marched south to Cork where they embarked on ships for France, many of them accompanied by their wives and children. Individual soldiers wanting to join the French, Spanish or Austrian armies also emigrated in what became known as the Flight of the Wild Geese.

The Jacobite soldiers also had the option of joining the Williamite army. 1,000 soldiers chose this option. The Jacobite soldiers thirdly had the option of returning home which some 2,000 soldiers chose.

This treaty had twenty-nine articles, which were agreed upon between Lieutenant-General Ginkle, Commander-in-Chief of the English army, and the Lieutenant-Generals D&#x27;Usson and de Tessé, Commanders-in-Chief of the Irish army. The articles were signed by D&#x27;Usson, Le Chevalier de Tesse, Latour Montfort, Patrick Sarsfield (Earl of Lucan), Colonel Nicholas Purcell of Loughmoe, Mark Talbot, and Piers, Viscount Galmoy.

==Civil articles==
These articles protected the rights of the defeated Jacobite landed gentry and merchants who chose to remain in Ireland, most of whom were Catholics. Their property was not to be confiscated so long as they swore allegiance to William III and Mary II, and Catholic noblemen were to be allowed to bear arms. Four were included by name: Colonel Lutterel, Captain Rowland White, Maurice Eustace of Yeomanstown, and Chievers of Maystown commonly called Mount Leinster. William required peace in Ireland and was allied to the Papacy in 1691 within the League of Augsburg.

This Treaty contained thirteen articles which were agreed upon, on the Williamite side, by the Lords Justices of Ireland — Sir Charles Porter and Thomas Coningsby, 1st Earl Coningsby — and the Commander-in-Chief, Baron de Ginkel; and on the Jacobite side by Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan; Piers Butler, 3rd Viscount Galmoye; Colonels Nicholas Purcell of Loughmoe, Nicholas Cusack, Garrett Dillon, and John Brown; and Sir Toby Butler, who was the actual draftsman. The treaty was signed by Porter, Coningsby, and de Ginkel, and witnessed by Scavenmoer, H. Mackay, and T. Talmash.

It has been said that &quot;the ink was not dry on the Treaty&quot; before the English broke it—the civil articles were not honoured by the victorious Williamite government. The few Catholic landowners who took the oath in 1691-93 remained protected, including their descendants. Those who did not were known as &quot;non-jurors&quot;, and their loyalty to the new regime was automatically suspect. Some managed to have outlawry specifically reversed, such as the 8th Viscount Dillon in 1694, or the Earl of Clanricarde in 1701.

The Papacy again recognized James II as the lawful king of Ireland from 1693. From 1695 this provoked a series of harsh penal laws to be enacted by the Parliament of Ireland, to make it difficult for the Irish Catholic gentry who had not taken the oath by 1695 to remain Catholic. The laws were extended for political reasons by the Dublin administration during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14), and reforms did not start until the 1770s.

It is often thought that Limerick was the only treaty between the Jacobites and the Williamites. A similar treaty had been signed on the surrender of Galway on 22 July 1691, but without the strict loyalty oath required under the Treaty of Limerick. The Galway garrison had been organised by the mostly-Catholic landed gentry of counties Galway and Mayo, who benefited from their property guarantees in the following century. The Limerick treaty marked the end of the war.

==Williamite settlement forfeitures==
In the following 8 years further confiscations were made from the continuing adherents to the Jacobite cause, and also further pardons were granted. The Commissioners of Forfeitures reported to the Irish House of Commons in December 1699 as follows:
* 3,921 named persons had been outlawed initially, who owned
* 1,060,792 acres
* that produced rents of £211,623 a year, and were worth £4,685,130 10&quot;s&quot;

Of these,
* 491 had been pardoned in accord with the treaties at Cavan and Limerick, and 792 otherwise; Some of the remaining 2,638 persons or their families had had property restored.
* Ultimately the total amount received by the Commissioners was: 752,953 acres paying rents of £135,793 p.a., worth £1,699,343. A further £300,000 in chattels and £1,092,000 of forestry had been seized, along with several hundred individual houses.

<text>The Rugby League Tri-Nations (known as the Gillette Tri-Nations for sponsorship reasons) was a rugby league tournament involving the top three teams in the sport: Australia, Great Britain and New Zealand and is the predecessor of today&#x27;s Rugby League Four Nations.

First contested in 1999 (as the Tri-Series), it is a logical continuation of the format originally used for the Rugby League World Cup in which the best teams in the world play in a round-robin tournament leading to the two top teams contesting a final. The World Cup itself is now contested by a much larger number of nations. Four Tri-Nations tournaments were held before 2009 when the competition was replaced by a Four Nations series.

==The competition==

The tournament has been organised in two different formats. In 1999 each team played the others once, before the top two teams played each other in a final. From 2004 each team has played the others twice before the tournament final. The top two teams are calculated using a league table. Teams receive:

* 2 points for a win
* 1 point for a draw
* 0 points for a loss

The tournament begins in the middle of October, after the National Rugby League grand final. Australia and New Zealand play each other at this time, and Great Britain enters the tournament after the Super League grand final.

During the tournament, some teams have also played additional Test matches. In the southern hemisphere New Zealand has played Tonga, and in the northern hemisphere Australia and New Zealand have played France.

==History==
The first Tri-Nations tournament was held in 1999 in Australia and New Zealand. When the Great Britain team only narrowly defeated the Queensland Cup premiers, the Burleigh Bears, it became apparent that they would not pose a serious threat to the other two teams. Accordingly, a very small crowd attended the Test between the Kangaroos and the Lions at Suncorp Stadium. Fearing a similar crowd for the tournament final, organisers moved that match from Sydney to Auckland. With the Rugby League World Cup being held in 2000, the Tri-nations tournament was put on hold indefinitely.

Australia was to dominate international rugby league over the next three years, winning the World Cup, defeating Great Britain 2–1 and 3–0 in Kangaroo Tours in 2001 and 2003, and defeating Great Britain and New Zealand by large margins in the mid-year Tests of 2002 and 2003. There was much criticism of the state of international rugby league in the media at this time. In response, Brisbane Broncos coach, Wayne Bennett, proposed that the Tri-nations tournament be resurrected (albeit without a final). Accordingly, a revamped Tri-nations tournament was played in 2004.

With the exception of the first match between Australia and New Zealand, the 2004 Tri-Nations was held in the United Kingdom. Each of the qualifying games was highly competitive, especially Australia&#x27;s loss to Great Britain, who finished at the top of the Tri-Nations table. Although Australia soundly defeated Great Britain in the final, the tournament was widely considered to be a success, making a profit of £750,000.

The 2005 Tri-Nations opened with games in both Australia and New Zealand, before moving to the United Kingdom for the remainder of the tournament. Although some of the matches were not as close as the previous tournament, all three teams were in contention for the final by the last group match. New Zealand won the final, defeating Australia 24–0 at Elland Road in Leeds. This was Australia&#x27;s first defeat in an international test series in 27 years.

The 2006 Tri-nations tournament was held in Australia and New Zealand. Controversy erupted as Nathan Fien was determined to be ineligible to play for New Zealand. This resulted in a loss of two competition points that New Zealand gained from their win against Great Britain in Christchurch. Great Britain then went on to beat Australia in Sydney 23–12, their first win in Australia since 1992, leaving the series wide open. However Great Britain went on to suffer heavy defeats in their last two games, leaving Australia and New Zealand to again contest the final. Australia won 16–12, the game having gone to golden point extra time after finishing 12–12 after 80 minutes.

The United Kingdom and France hosted the new Four Nations series in 2009. Great Britain would not compete in the tournament, with England replacing them. The Rugby League International Federation announced on 10 November 2006 that the France would participate in the 2009 tournament.

==Trivia==
* New Zealand&#x27;s win in the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations was the first time that Australia had not won an international test series for 27 years. It was also the Kiwis first series win over Australia since 1952.
* The tournament was not held in 2007, as New Zealand instead completed a celebratory tour of Europe, commemorating 100 years of international rugby league. Australia played Tests against New Zealand in April and October 2007.
* The tournament was not held in 2008 due to the staging of the Rugby League World Cup held in Australia, commemorating 100 years of rugby league in that country.
* No team has gone through the tournament unbeaten.
* The winning team did not finish at the top of the table in the first three Tri-Nations series: New Zealand were placed first in 1999, followed by Great Britain in 2004 and Australia in 2005. Australia broke this trend in 2006.

<text>Tsebin Tchen () (10 March 1941 – 25 November 2019) was a Chinese-Australian Liberal member of the Australian Senate from 1999 to 2005, as Senator of Victoria.

==Early life==
Tchen was born in Chongqing to refugees during WW2. His father was then a junior diplomat with the Chinese Government and was posted overseas when Tchen was two years old. Tchen followed his father to various postings and never returned to China to live, except for two years (1954–56) in Taiwan, where the Nationalist government relocated after Communist takeover. His father continued as diplomat to represent the Republic of China government until 1975 when he retired to live with Tchen in Australia. In 1958, Tchen gained a student visa to Australia to study—at that time, the only way for Asians to enter Australia due to the White Australia Policy. Eventually, he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in town planning at Sydney University.

==Early career==
From 1966, Tchen worked as a New South Wales government town planner in Sydney. Harold Holt succeeded Robert Menzies as Australian Prime Minister in 1965 and effectively ended the White Australia Policy by altering the immigration law to allow Asian migration. After weighing up his choices, Tchen decided to remain in Australia, and gained citizenship in 1971.

==Political career==
In 1972, he joined the Liberal Party of Australia, and became active in Melbourne&#x27;s Chinese community after moving there to work in 1973. At the 1993 election, Tchen was preselected on the Liberal Senate ticket for Victoria, in the unwinnable fourth position. Despite that, Tchen had made history by being the first Asian-born migrant to be endorsed by either major party in Australian politics at a national election.

Tchen made another run for pre-selection in 1998, at the height of the Pauline Hanson controversy, and was successful. In order to gain preselection, he had to replace a sitting Senator, Karen Synon. She was defeated by Tchen for the third position on the combined Liberal-National Party Senate ticket – a rare event in Australian politics. Synon was relegated to the unwinnable fourth position by a narrow margin of eight votes in a bitter preselection battle. Tchen only succeeded by gaining the support of the then-Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett who, as well as ringing delegates personally, appointed eight state Members of Parliament as voting delegates to the preselection convention which was enough to secure Tchen&#x27;s victory. While Kennett&#x27;s previous interventions in federal politics had been unsuccessful, his opposition to Hanson caused him to break Party rules which mandated the election of delegates. Kennett&#x27;s preference for Tchen over Synon sparked a major factional dispute within the party, with the Federal Treasurer Peter Costello and Michael Kroger, a former Party President – both sworn Synon supporters – failing to fend off Tchen&#x27;s challenge.

After the Senate Group Voting ticket issued for the Democratic Labour Party saw it preference the ALP over Tchen, the ALP&#x27;s third candidate won the fifth Senate spot. In an ironic twist, Tchen was elected on One Nation preferences over the Australian Greens for the final sixth spot and became the second Asian-born migrant to win a seat in either house of the federal parliament after Irina Dunn.

In spite of his rather turbulent introduction, Tchen performed unobtrusively in parliament. He served on a large number of committees but on the floor of the senate, he was rarely heard. He remained a strong advocate of multiculturalism emphasising the need to seek common purposes rather than identifying differences and of demanding acceptance rather than just tolerance. Despite being chair of the government members&#x27; policy committee on immigration and multicultural affairs between 2000 and 2004, a position elected by Liberal parliamentarians, Tchen did not significantly influence policy as Australia grappled with the vexing issue of how to deal with asylum seekers and boat people.

In December 2003, Tchen stood for preselection for a second term in the Senate. Despite the claimed support of Prime Minister John Howard, Tchen suffered the same fate as his predecessor and clearly lost to former lower house MP Michael Ronaldson. Unlike Synon who chose to contest the election from fourth spot on the Party ticket in 1998, Tchen declined the offer of the fourth spot and did not stand at the 2004 election. He retired from the Senate when his term expired on 30 June 2005.

Tchen was the third Chinese-Australian elected to federal parliament, following Irina Dunn and Bill O&#x27;Chee. He was the second Asian migrant elected to the federal parliament of Australia.

== After politics ==
In his retirement, Tchen again took up his interest in Australian history, especially Chinese Australian History which he believes should be treated as an integral part of Australian History, rather than as a matter of niche interest. He has worked with several notable Australian historians including Judith Brett and John Fitzgerald. He was an adjunct professor with Swinburne University of Technology at the Asia-Pacific Centre for Social Investment and Philanthropy at the Faculty of Business and Law.

In 2015, Tchen was appointed a Commissioner of the Victorian Multicultural Commission by the Labor State Government.

In 2018, Tchen was appointed to the Australian Multicultural Council (AMC), a ministerially appointed body representing a broad cross-section of Australian interests that provides independent and robust advice to Government on multicultural affairs, social cohesion and integration policy and programs.

He continued his voluntary community involvement, and demonstrated extensive links with community organisations, acting as an advisor to a number of Chinese community associations.

Tchen died in a car crash in South Australia on 25 November 2019.

== Personal life==

Tchen was married to Pauline, a librarian. They have two adult children: Jacinta who is a marketing and cultural strategist and Adrian, a surgeon.

<doc id="954264" wikidata="Q350321" url="?curid=954264" title="Ivar the Boneless">
<text>Ivar the Boneless ( ; died ), also known as Ivar Ragnarsson, was a Viking leader who invaded England and Ireland. According to the &quot;Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot;, he was the son of Aslaug and her husband Ragnar Loðbrok, and was the brother of Björn Ironside, Halvdan (or Hvitserk), Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, and Ragnvald. However, it is not known whether this is historically accurate. Ivar is sometimes regarded as the same person as Ímar, a Viking king of Dublin between 870 and 873.

It is unclear why Ivar acquired the nickname &quot;boneless&quot;. Some sagas claim that he was born with a skeletal condition which left him unable to walk, while others suggest that he was merely impotent.

==Sources==
According to the &quot;Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot;, Ivar&#x27;s bonelessness was the result of a curse. His mother, Aslaug, Ragnar&#x27;s third wife was described as a völva, a seer or clairvoyant. Aslaug suggested that she and her husband wait for three nights before consummating their marriage after a long separation while he was in England raiding. However, Ragnar was passionate after such a long separation and did not heed her words. As a result, Ivar was born with weak bones.

Another hypothesis is that he was actually known as &quot;the Hated&quot;, which in Latin would be &quot;exosus&quot;. A medieval scribe with only a basic knowledge of Latin could easily have interpreted it as &quot;ex&quot; (without) &quot;os&quot; (bone), thus &quot;the Boneless&quot;, although it is hard to align this theory with the direct translation of his name given in Norse sources.

While the sagas describe Ivar&#x27;s physical disability, they also emphasise his wisdom, cunning, and mastery of strategy and tactics in battle.

He is often considered identical to Ímar, the founder of the Uí Ímair dynasty, which at various times, from the mid-ninth to the tenth century, ruled Northumbria from the city of York, and dominated the Irish Sea region as the Kingdom of Dublin. This would also make him the ancestor of the Crovan Dynasty.

===Chronology===

* In 865 the Great Heathen Army, led by Ivar, invaded the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The Heptarchy was the collective name for the seven kingdoms East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Mercia, Northumbria, Sussex and Wessex. The invasion was organised by the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok, to wreak revenge against Ælla of Northumbria who had supposedly executed Ragnar in 865 by throwing him in a snake pit, but the historicity of this explanation is unknown. According to the saga, Ivar did not overcome Ælla and sought reconciliation. He asked for only as much land as he could cover with an ox&#x27;s hide and swore never to wage war against Ælla. Then Ivar cut the ox&#x27;s hide into such fine strands that he could envelop a large fortress (in an older saga it was York and according to a younger saga it was London), which he could take as his own (compare the similar legendary ploy of Dido).
* Late the next year, the army turned north and invaded Northumbria, eventually capturing Ælla at York in 867. According to legend, Ælla was executed by Ivar and his brothers using the blood eagle, a ritual method of execution of debated historicity whereby the ribcage is opened from behind and the lungs are pulled out, forming a wing-like shape. Later in the year, the army moved south and invaded the kingdom of Mercia, capturing the town of Nottingham, where they spent the winter. King Burgred of Mercia responded by allying with the West Saxon king Æthelred of Wessex, and with a combined force they laid siege to the town. The Anglo-Saxons were unable to recapture the city, but a truce was agreed whereby the Danes would withdraw to York. The Great Heathen Army remained in York for over a year, gathering its strength for further assaults.
* Ivar and Ubba are identified as the commanders of the Danes when they returned to East Anglia in 869, and as the executioners of the East Anglian king, Edmund the Martyr, for refusing their demand that he renounce Christ. The precise account of Edmund&#x27;s death is unknown, but it has been suggested that his capture and execution at the hands of the sons of Ragnar is likely to have occurred.

==Death==
The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records his death as 870. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; describe the death of Ímar in 873. The death of Ímar is also recorded in the &quot;Fragmentary Annals of Ireland&quot; under the year 873.

The identification of the king of Laithlind as Gothfraid (i.e., Ímar&#x27;s father) was added by a copyist in the 17th century. In the original 11th-century manuscript, the subject of the entry was simply called &quot;righ Lochlann&quot; (&quot;the king of Lochlainn&quot;), which more than likely referred to Ímar, whose death is not otherwise noted in the &quot;Fragmentary Annals&quot;. The cause of death—a sudden and horrible disease—is not mentioned in any other source, but it raises the possibility that the true origin of Ivar&#x27;s Old Norse nickname lay in the crippling effects of an unidentified disease that struck him down at the end of his life.

In 1686, a farm labourer named Thomas Walker discovered a Scandinavian burial mound at Repton in Derbyshire, close to a battle site where the Great Heathen Army overthrew the Mercian king Burgred. The number of partial skeletons surrounding the body—over 250—signified that the man buried there was of very high status. It has been suggested that such a burial mound is possibly the last resting place of Ivar.

According to the saga, Ivar ordered that he be buried in a place that was exposed to attack, and prophesied that, if that was done, foes coming to the land would be met with ill-success. This prophecy held true, says the saga, until &quot;when Vilhjalm bastard (William I of England) came ashore[,] he went [to the burial site] and broke Ivar&#x27;s mound and saw that [Ivar&#x27;s] body had not decayed. Then Vilhjalm had a large pyre made upon which Ivar&#x27;s body was] burned... Thereupon, [Vilhjalm proceeded with the landing invasion and achieved] the victory.&quot;

==Fictional portrayals==

* Ivar the Boneless is a minor character in the 1969 film &quot;Alfred the Great&quot;, portrayed as an acrobatic and agile warrior.
* In the 2013 film &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot;, Ivar the Boneless is portrayed as a reclusive, homosexual Viking. The character was played by Ivan Kaye, who later portrayed King Ælla of Northumbria in the History television series &quot;Vikings&quot;. 
* In &quot;Vikings&quot;, Ivar is portrayed as the son of Ragnar and Aslaug and a younger half-brother to Björn Ironside. He first appeared in season 2 as a baby, and later was played by James Quinn Markey and Alex Høgh Andersen.
* Ivar&#x27;s invasion of East Anglia and killing of Edmund the Martyr are depicted in the video for The Darkness&#x27;s song &quot;Barbarian&quot;.
* Ivar is a character in the 1993 novel &quot;The Hammer and the Cross&quot;.
* Ivar appears as a minor character in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, in which his epithet &quot;the Boneless&quot; is explained by him being very thin. Ivar dies off-screen in the novel, and his later descendants continually appear throughout the remainder of the series.
* Ivar is a recurring character in Ubisoft&#x27;s video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla&quot;, which takes place in for the most part in England between 873 CE and 878 CE. He plays a significant part in the main storyline of the game.
* In the 2020 game &quot;Crusader Kings 3&quot; by Paradox Interactive, Ivar is a playable character as leader of the Jarldom of the Suðreyjar in northwestern Scotland. His character in game is missing a leg, referring to his epithet &quot;the Boneless&quot;.

<doc id="954270" wikidata="Q1542152" url="?curid=954270" title="Flight of the Wild Geese">
<text>The Flight of the Wild Geese was the departure of an Irish Jacobite army under the command of Patrick Sarsfield from Ireland to France, as agreed in the Treaty of Limerick on 3 October 1691, following the end of the Williamite War in Ireland. More broadly, the term Wild Geese is used in Irish history to refer to Irish soldiers who left to serve in continental European armies in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.

An earlier exodus in 1690, during the same war, had formed the French Irish Brigade, who are sometimes misdescribed as Wild Geese.

==By country==
===Spanish service===

The first Irish troops to serve as a unit for a continental power formed an Irish regiment in the Spanish Army of Flanders in the Eighty Years&#x27; War in the 1590s. The regiment had been raised by an English Catholic, William Stanley, in Ireland from native Irish soldiers and mercenaries, whom the English authorities wanted out of the country. (See also Tudor conquest of Ireland). Stanley was given a commission by Elizabeth I and was intended to lead his regiment on the English side, in support of the Dutch United Provinces. However, in 1585, motivated by religious factors and bribes offered by the Spaniards, Stanley defected to the Spanish side with the regiment. In 1598 Diego Brochero de Anaya wrote to the Spanish King Philip III:
that every year Your Highness should order to recruit in Ireland some Irish soldiers, who are people tough and strong, and nor the cold weather or bad food could kill them easily as they would with the Spanish, as in their island, which is much colder than this one, they are almost naked, they sleep on the floor and eat oats bread, meat and water, without drinking any wine.
The unit fought in the Netherlands until 1600 when it was disbanded due to heavy wastage through combat and sickness.

Following the defeat of the Gaelic armies of the Nine Years&#x27; War, the &quot;Flight of the Earls&quot; took place in 1607. The Earl of Tyrone Hugh O&#x27;Neill, the Earl of Tyrconnell Rory O&#x27;Donnell and the Lord of Beare and Bantry, Donal O&#x27;Sullivan, along with many chiefs, Gallowglass, and their followers from Ulster, fled Ireland. They hoped to get Spanish help in order to restart their rebellion in Ireland, but King Philip III of Spain did not want a resumption of war with England and refused their request.

Nevertheless, their arrival led to the formation of a new Irish regiment in Flanders, officered by Gaelic Irish nobles and recruited from their followers and dependents in Ireland. This regiment was more overtly political than its predecessor in Spanish service and was militantly hostile to English Protestant rule of Ireland. The regiment was led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s son John. Prominent officers included Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill and Hugh Dubh O&#x27;Neill.

A fresh source of recruits came in the early 17th century, when Roman Catholics were banned from military and political office in Ireland. As a result, the Irish units in the Spanish service began attracting Catholic Old English officers such as Thomas Preston and Garret Barry. These men had more pro-English views than their Gaelic counterparts and animosity was created over plans to use the Irish regiment to invade Ireland in 1627. The regiment was garrisoned in Brussels during the truce in the Eighty Years&#x27; War from 1609 to 1621 and developed links with Irish Catholic clergy based in the seminary there, creating the Irish Colleges including Florence Conroy.

Many of the Irish troops in Spanish service returned to Ireland after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and fought in the armies of Confederate Ireland a movement of Irish Catholics. When the Confederates were defeated and Ireland occupied after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, around 34,000 Irish Confederate troops fled the country to seek service in Spain. Some of them later deserted or defected to French service, where the conditions were deemed better.

During the 18th century, Spain&#x27;s Irish regiments saw service not only in Europe but also in the Americas. As examples, the Irlanda Regiment (raised 1698) was stationed in Havana from 1770 to 1771, the Ultonia Regiment (raised 1709) in Mexico from 1768 to 1771, and the Regiment of Hibernia (raised 1709) in Honduras from 1782 to 1783.

At the time of the Napoleonic Wars all three of these Irish infantry regiments still formed part of the Spanish army. Heavy losses and recruiting difficulties diluted the Irish element in these units, although the officers remained of Irish ancestry. The Hibernia Regiment had to be reconstituted with Galician recruits in 1811 and ended the war as an entirely Spanish corps. All three regiments were finally disbanded in 1818 on the grounds that insufficient recruits, whether Irish or other foreigners, were forthcoming.

===French service===
From the mid-17th century or so, France overtook Spain as the destination for Catholic Irishmen seeking a military career. The reasons for this included the increased overlap between French and Irish interests, and the ease of migration to France and Flanders from Ireland.

France recruited many foreign soldiers during various periods; Germans, Italians, Irish, Scottish and Swiss. André Corvisier, the authority on French military archives, estimates that foreigners accounted for around 12% of all French troops in peacetime and 20% of troops during warfare. In common with the other foreign troops the Irish regiments were paid more than their French counterparts. Both Irish and Swiss regiments in French service wore red uniforms, though this had no connection with the redcoats of the British army.

The crucial turning point came during the Williamite War in Ireland (1688–91), when Louis XIV gave military and financial aid to the Irish Jacobites. In 1690, in return for 6,000 French troops that were shipped to Ireland, Louis demanded 6,000 Irish recruits for use in the Nine Years&#x27; War against the Dutch. Five regiments, led by Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel formed the nucleus of Mountcashel&#x27;s French Irish Brigade. A year later, after the Irish Jacobites under Patrick Sarsfield agreed to favourable peace terms and capitulated at the Treaty of Limerick in 1691, the fully armed and equipped Irish Army withdrew to France.

Sarsfield sailed to France on 22 December 1691, leading 19,000 of his countrymen and countrywomen to enter the French service in the first phase of the military denuding of Ireland. Sarsfield&#x27;s exodus included 14,000 soldiers and around 6,000 women and children. This event began what is remembered in Ireland as the &quot;Flight of the Wild Geese&quot;. In a poem two centuries later, W. B. Yeats would mourn: 
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Was it for this the Wild Geese spread&quot;
&quot;A grey wing on every tide…&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Sarsfield&#x27;s Irish army was regrouped and equipped in their red coats, symbolizing their allegiance to the Stuart king. In 1692, a large Franco-Irish army had assembled on the French coast for an invasion of England, but the proposed invasion was scuppered due to the French naval defeat at Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. Sarsfield&#x27;s Wild Geese were then re-grouped on the same footing as Mountcashel&#x27;s Irish Brigade.

Up until 1745, the Catholic Irish gentry were allowed to discreetly recruit soldiers for French service. The authorities in Ireland saw this as preferable to the potentially disruptive effects of having large numbers of unemployed young men of military age in the country. However, after a composite Irish detachment from the French Army (drawn from each of the regiments comprising the Irish Brigade and designated as &quot;Irish Picquets&quot;) was used to support the Jacobite rising of 1745, the British authorities realised the dangers of this policy and banned recruitment for foreign armies in Ireland. After this point, the rank and file of the Irish units in French service were increasingly non-Irish, although the officers continued to be recruited from Ireland.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War efforts were made to find recruits from among Irish prisoners of war or deserters from the British Army. Otherwise, recruitment was limited to a trickle of Irish volunteers who were able to make their own way to France, or from the sons of former members of the Irish Brigade who had remained in France. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Irish Regiments in French service were: Bulkeley, Clare, Dillon, Rooth, Berwich and Lally. Additionally, there was a regiment of cavalry: &quot;Fitzjames&quot;. By the end of the 18th century, even the officers of the Irish Regiments were drawn from Franco-Irish families who had settled in France for several generations. While often French in all but name, such families retained their Irish heritages.

Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, the Irish Brigade ceased to exist as a separate entity on 21 July 1791 when the 12 non-Swiss foreign regiments then in existence were integrated into the line infantry of the French Army. Although the remaining Irish regiments: Dillon&#x27;s, Berwick&#x27;s and Walsh&#x27;s, lost their distinctive red uniforms and separate status, they were still known informally by their traditional titles. Many individual Franco-Irish officers left the service in 1792 when Louis XVI was deposed, as their oath of loyalty was to him and not to the French nation.

In 1803 Napoleon Bonaparte raised a light infantry Irish unit composed mainly of veterans of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Napoleon&#x27;s Irish Legion originally comprised one under-strength battalion but it was later raised to a regiment comprising four battalions and a regimental depot or headquarters. The Legion was designated as a distinctly Irish unit from its establishment. The intention was that the Legion would spearhead an invasion of Ireland, supported by French troops. The unit was dressed in emerald-green uniforms faced with gold and received their regimental colour of a gold harp in each corner on a green background inscribed with &quot;Le Premier Consul aux Irlandos Uni&quot; (&quot;The First Consul to United Ireland&quot;) and on the obverse; &quot;Liberte des Conscience/Independence d&#x27;Irlande&quot; (&quot;Freedom of Conscience/Independence to Ireland&quot;). In December 1804 they received a new Colour and Napoleon&#x27;s cherished bronze-cast Imperial Eagle. Many officers from the ancien régime Irish Brigade also joined the unit, where it gained distinction in the Walcheren Expedition in the Low Countries and during the Peninsular War, in particular during the Siege of Astorga (1812) where an Irish detachment of elite voltigeurs formed the &quot;forlorn hope&quot; and led the assault battalion, comprising the 47th Regiment of the Line, which stormed through the breach, taking cover all night under heavy fire inside the city&#x27;s walls. By morning the defenders surrendered as they were out of ammunition. The last significant action involving the unit was during the siege of Antwerp in 1814, when the Irish Legion defended the city for three months against an Anglo-Prussian force which had landed in the Low Countries to defeat Napoleon. The siege was lifted after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication and the unit was shortly afterwards disbanded, ending a 125-year-old Irish military tradition in France.

===Italian service===
Despite being less studied, the ancient and traditional &quot;&quot;mestiere delle armi&quot; in Italy was also a well-known profession by the Irish. The &quot;tercio&quot;&quot; of Lucas Taf (around 500 men) served in Milan towards 1655. The Army of Savoy included also Irishmen, but in Italy, the Irish were organized basically by the Spanish administration. In 1694, another regiment in Milan was exclusively composed of Irishmen. Around 3–4% of a total of 20,000 men were Irish in the Spanish Army of Milan. It is not a high figure, but it was important as regards quality. In this context, James Francis Fitz-James Stuart (1696–1739), Duke of Berwick and of Liria is just one example of this success. He began to serve the monarchy in 1711 and succeeded in becoming General Lieutenant (1732), ambassador in Russia, in Austria and in Naples, where he died. In 1702, an Irish grenadier company led by Francis Terry entered Venetian service. This company of Jacobite exiles served at Zara until 1706. Colonel Terry became the Colonel of a Venetian Dragoon Regiment, which the Terry family mostly commanded until 1797. Colonel Terry&#x27;s Dragoons uniforms were red-faced blue in the Irish tradition. The Limerick Regiment, of Irish Jacobites, transferred from Spanish service to that of the Bourbon king of Sicily in 1718.

===Austrian service===
Throughout this period, there were also substantial numbers of Irish officers and men in the armies or service of European powers, including the Austrian Habsburg Empire. It was not uncommon for Irish commanders of the Habsburg Empire to encounter enemy armies led by other Irishmen. One such example was Peter Lacy, a field marshal in the Imperial Russian Army, whose son Franz excelled in the Austrian service. General Maximilian Ulysses Browne, the Austrian commanding officer in the Battle of Lobositz, was also of Irish descent. Recruitment for Austrian service included areas of the midlands of Ireland, and members of the Taaffe, O&#x27;Neill and Wallis families served with Austria. Count Alexander O&#x27;Nelly (O&#x27;Neill), who came from Ulster, commanded the 42nd Bohemian Infantry Regiment from 1734 to 1743. Much earlier, in 1634, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Irish officers led by Walter Deveraux assassinated general Albrecht von Wallenstein on the orders of the Emperor. In the late 18th and throughout the 19th century, further Irish officers served in the Habsburg Empire, so Andreas O&#x27;Reilly von Ballinlough (1742–1832), whose military service extended through the Seven Years&#x27; War, the War of the Bavarian Succession, the Austro-Turkish War, the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars, furthermore Laval Graf Nugent von Westmeath and Maximilian Graf O’Donnell von Tyrconnell, who saved the life of Emperor Franz Joseph I during an assassination attempt. Gottfried von Banfield finally became the most successful Austro-Hungarian naval aeroplane pilot in the First World War.

===Swedish and Polish service===
In 1609, Arthur Chichester, then Lord Deputy of Ireland, deported 1,300 former rebel Irish soldiers from Ulster to serve in the Protestant Swedish Army. However, under the influence of Catholic clergy, many of them deserted to Polish service.

The Catholic Irish troops in Protestant Swedish service changed sides during the Battle of Klushino, against largely Catholic Poland, the only European country with statutory freedom of religion at the time. The Irish then served in Polish service for several years during the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618), until their wages went unpaid.

==End of the Wild Geese==
Irish recruitment for continental armies declined sharply after it was made illegal in 1745. In practical terms, this meant that recruiting within Ireland itself effectively ceased and Irishmen seeking employment in foreign armies had to make their own way to the Continent. Replacements accordingly were drawn increasingly from the descendants of Irish soldiers who had settled in France or Spain; from non-Irish foreign recruits such as more readily available Germans or Swiss; or from natives of the recruiting countries.

In 1732, Sir Charles Wogan indicated in a letter to Dean Swift that 120,000 Irishmen had been killed and wounded in foreign service &quot;within these forty years&quot;, with Swift later replying:

As noted above, as late as the late 1780s, there were still three Irish regiments in France. During the Napoleonic Wars at least nominally Irish units continued to serve in the Spanish and French armies. At the time of the Franco-Prussian War a volunteer Irish medical unit, the Franco-Irish Ambulance Brigade, was serving with the French Army.

It was some time before the British armed forces began to tap into Irish Catholic manpower. In the late 18th century, the Penal Laws were gradually relaxed and in the 1790s the laws prohibiting Catholics from bearing arms were abolished. Thereafter, the British began recruiting Irish regiments for the Crown Force including for such units as the Connaught Rangers. Several more Irish-labelled units were created in the 19th century. By 1914 infantry regiments in the British Army that were associated with Ireland included the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Irish Guards, the Royal Irish Regiment, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Rifles, the Royal Irish Fusiliers, the Connaught Rangers and the Royal Munster Fusiliers. With the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, five of the above regiments were disbanded, with most of the remainder undergoing a series of amalgamations between 1968 and 2006. The United Kingdom still retains four Irish-named regiments: the Irish Guards, the Royal Irish Regiment, the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, and the London Irish Rifles. The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars, the successor regiment of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, and the Royal Dragoon Guards, the successor regiment of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, maintain the Irish heritage of their antecedent regiments through their uniforms, regimental bands and traditions, such as the celebration of St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

== Other use ==
The term &quot;Wild Geese&quot; is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to Irish emigrants. This usage can be seen, for example in the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, which has a recurrent section called Wild Geese in which &quot;Irish people working abroad tell their stories&quot;.

<doc id="954281" wikidata="Q13404475" url="?curid=954281" title="Cache replacement policies">
<text>In computing, cache replacement policies (also known as cache replacement algorithms or cache algorithms) are optimizing instructions or algorithms which a computer program or hardware-maintained structure can utilize to manage a cache of information. Caching improves performance by keeping recent or often-used data items in memory locations which are faster, or computationally cheaper to access, than normal memory stores. When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for new data.
==Overview==
The average memory reference time is
: formula_1
where
: formula_2 = miss ratio = 1 - (hit ratio)
: formula_3 = time to make main-memory access when there is a miss (or, with a multi-level cache, average memory reference time for the next-lower cache)
: formula_4= latency: time to reference the cache (should be the same for hits and misses)
: formula_5 = secondary effects, such as queuing effects in multiprocessor systems

A cache has two primary figures of merit: latency and hit ratio. A number of secondary factors also affect cache performance.

The hit ratio of a cache describes how often a searched-for item is found. More efficient replacement policies track more usage information to improve the hit rate for a given cache size.
The latency of a cache describes how long after requesting a desired item the cache can return that item when there is a hit. Faster replacement strategies typically track of less usage information—or, with a direct-mapped cache, no information—to reduce the time required to update the information. Each replacement strategy is a compromise between hit rate and latency.

Hit-rate measurements are typically performed on benchmark applications, and the hit ratio varies by application. Video and audio streaming applications often have a hit ratio near zero, because each bit of data in the stream is read once (a compulsory miss), used, and then never read or written again. Many cache algorithms (particularly LRU) allow streaming data to fill the cache, pushing out information which will soon be used again (cache pollution). Other factors may be size, length of time to obtain, and expiration. Depending on cache size, no further caching algorithm to discard items may be needed. Algorithms also maintain cache coherence when several caches are used for the same data, such as multiple database servers updating a shared data file.

==Policies==

=== Bélády&#x27;s algorithm ===
The most efficient caching algorithm would be to discard information which would not be needed for the longest time; this is known as Bélády&#x27;s optimal algorithm, optimal replacement policy, or the clairvoyant algorithm. Since it is generally impossible to predict how far in the future information will be needed, this is unfeasible in practice. The practical minimum can be calculated after experimentation, and the effectiveness of a chosen cache algorithm can be compared.

When a page fault occurs, a set of pages is in memory. In the example, the sequence of 5, 0, 1 is accessed by Frame 1, Frame 2, and Frame 3 respectively. When 2 is accessed, it replaces value 5 (which is in frame 1, predicting that value 5 will not be accessed in the near future. Because a general-purpose operating system cannot predict when 5 will be accessed, Bélády&#x27;s algorithm cannot be implemented there.

===Random replacement (RR)===
Random replacement selects an item and discards it to make space when necessary. This algorithm does not require keeping any access history. It has been used in ARM processors due to its simplicity, and it allows efficient stochastic simulation.

=== Simple queue-based policies ===

==== First in first out (FIFO) ====
With this algorithm, the cache behaves like a FIFO queue; it evicts blocks in the order in which they were added, regardless of how often or how many times they were accessed before.

==== Last in first out (LIFO) or First in last out (FILO) ====
The cache behaves like a stack, and unlike a FIFO queue. The cache evicts the block added most recently first, regardless of how often or how many times it was accessed before.

==== SIEVE ====
SIEVE is a simple eviction algorithm designed specifically for web caches, such as key-value caches and Content Delivery Networks. 
It uses the idea of lazy promotion and quick demotion. Therefore, SIEVE does not update the global data structure at cache hits and delays the update till eviction time; meanwhile, it quickly evicts newly inserted objects because cache workloads tend to show high one-hit-wonder ratios, and most of the new objects are not worthwhile to be kept in the cache. SIEVE uses a single FIFO queue and uses a moving hand to select objects to evict. Objects in the cache have one bit of metadata indicating whether the object has been requested after being admitted into the cache. The eviction hand points to the tail of the queue at the beginning and moves toward the head over time. Compared with the CLOCK eviction algorithm, retained objects in SIEVE stay in the old position. Therefore, new objects are always at the head, and the old objects are always at the tail. As the hand moves toward the head, new objects are quickly evicted (quick demotion), which is the key to the high efficiency in the SIEVE eviction algorithm. SIEVE is simpler than LRU, but achieves lower miss ratios than LRU on par with state-of-the-art eviction algorithms. Moreover, on stationary skewed workloads, SIEVE is better than existing known algorithms including LFU.

=== Simple recency-based policies ===

==== Least Recently Used (LRU) ====
Discards least recently used items first. This algorithm requires keeping track of what was used and when, which is cumbersome. It requires &quot;age bits&quot; for cache lines, and tracks the least recently used cache line based on these age bits. When a cache line is used, the age of the other cache lines changes. LRU is a family of caching algorithms, that includes 2Q by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha and LRU/K by Pat O&#x27;Neil, Betty O&#x27;Neil and Gerhard Weikum. The access sequence for the example is A B C D E D F:

When A B C D is installed in the blocks with sequence numbers (increment 1 for each new access) and E is accessed, it is a miss and must be installed in a block. With the LRU algorithm, E will replace A because A has the lowest rank (A(0)). In the next-to-last step, D is accessed and the sequence number is updated. F is then accessed, replacing Bwhich had the lowest rank, (B(1)).

==== Time-aware, least-recently used ====
Time-aware, least-recently-used (TLRU) is a variant of LRU designed for when the contents of a cache have a valid lifetime. The algorithm is suitable for network cache applications such as information-centric networking (ICN), content delivery networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. TLRU introduces a term: TTU (time to use), a timestamp of content (or a page) which stipulates the usability time for the content based on its locality and the content publisher. TTU provides more control to a local administrator in regulating network storage.

When content subject to TLRU arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU based on the TTU assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated with a locally-defined function. When the local TTU value is calculated, content replacement is performed on a subset of the total content of the cache node. TLRU ensures that less-popular and short-lived content is replaced with incoming content.

==== Most-recently-used (MRU) ====

Unlike LRU, MRU discards the most-recently-used items first. At the 11th VLDB conference, Chou and DeWitt said: &quot;When a file is being repeatedly scanned in a [looping sequential] reference pattern, MRU is the best replacement algorithm.&quot; Researchers presenting at the 22nd VLDB conference noted that for random access patterns and repeated scans over large datasets (also known as cyclic access patterns), MRU cache algorithms have more hits than LRU due to their tendency to retain older data. MRU algorithms are most useful in situations where the older an item is, the more likely it is to be accessed. The access sequence for the example is A B C D E C D B:

A B C D are placed in the cache, since there is space available. At the fifth access (E), the block which held D is replaced with E since this block was used most recently. At the next access (to D), C is replaced since it was the block accessed just before D.

==== Segmented LRU (SLRU) ====
An SLRU cache is divided into two segments: probationary and protected. Lines in each segment are ordered from most- to least-recently-accessed. Data from misses is added to the cache at the most-recently-accessed end of the probationary segment. Hits are removed from where they reside and added to the most-recently-accessed end of the protected segment; lines in the protected segment have been accessed at least twice. The protected segment is finite; migration of a line from the probationary segment to the protected segment may force the migration of the LRU line in the protected segment to the most-recently-used end of the probationary segment, giving this line another chance to be accessed before being replaced. The size limit of the protected segment is an SLRU parameter which varies according to I/O workload patterns. When data must be discarded from the cache, lines are obtained from the LRU end of the probationary segment.

==== LRU approximations ====
LRU may be expensive in caches with higher associativity. Practical hardware usually employs an approximation to achieve similar performance at a lower hardware cost.

===== Pseudo-LRU (PLRU) =====

For CPU caches with large associativity (generally &gt; four ways), the implementation cost of LRU becomes prohibitive. In many CPU caches, an algorithm that almost always discards one of the least recently used items is sufficient; many CPU designers choose a PLRU algorithm, which only needs one bit per cache item to work. PLRU typically has a slightly-worse miss ratio, slightly-better latency, uses slightly less power than LRU, and has a lower overhead than LRU.

Bits work as a binary tree of one-bit pointers which point to a less-recently-used sub-tree. Following the pointer chain to the leaf node identifies the replacement candidate. With an access, all pointers in the chain from the accessed way&#x27;s leaf node to the root node are set to point to a sub-tree which does not contain the accessed path. The access sequence in the example is A B C D E:

When there is access to a value (such as A) and it is not in the cache, it is loaded from memory and placed in the block where the arrows are pointing in the example. After that block is placed, the arrows are flipped to point the opposite way. A, B, C and D are placed; E replaces A as the cache fills because that was where the arrows were pointing, and the arrows which led to A flip to point in the opposite direction (to B, the block which will be replaced on the next cache miss).

===== Clock-Pro =====
The LRU algorithm cannot be implemented in the critical path of computer systems, such as operating systems, due to its high overhead; Clock, an approximation of LRU, is commonly used instead. Clock-Pro is an approximation of LIRS for low-cost implementation in systems. Clock-Pro has the basic Clock framework, with three advantages. It has three &quot;clock hands&quot; (unlike Clock&#x27;s single &quot;hand&quot;), and can approximately measure the reuse distance of data accesses. Like LIRS, it can quickly evict one-time-access or low-locality data items. Clock-Pro is as complex as Clock, and is easy to implement at low cost. The buffer-cache replacement implementation in the 2017 version of Linux combines LRU and Clock-Pro.

=== Simple frequency-based policies ===

==== Least frequently used (LFU) ====

The LFU algorithm counts how often an item is needed; those used less often are discarded first. This is similar to LRU, except that how many times a block was accessed is stored instead of how recently. While running an access sequence, the block which was used the fewest times will be removed from the cache.

==== Least frequent recently used (LFRU) ====
The least frequent recently used (LFRU) algorithm combines the benefits of LFU and LRU. LFRU is suitable for network cache applications such as ICN, CDNs, and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions: privileged and unprivileged. The privileged partition is protected and, if content is popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. In replacing the privileged partition, LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition; pushes content from the privileged to the unprivileged partition, and inserts new content into the privileged partition. LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) algorithm for the unprivileged partition.

==== LFU with dynamic aging (LFUDA) ====
A variant, LFU with dynamic aging (LFUDA), uses dynamic aging to accommodate shifts in a set of popular objects; it adds a cache-age factor to the reference count when a new object is added to the cache or an existing object is re-referenced. LFUDA increments cache age when evicting blocks by setting it to the evicted object&#x27;s key value, and the cache age is always less than or equal to the minimum key value in the cache. If an object was frequently accessed in the past and becomes unpopular, it will remain in the cache for a long time (preventing newly- or less-popular objects from replacing it). Dynamic aging reduces the number of such objects, making them eligible for replacement, and LFUDA reduces cache pollution caused by LFU when a cache is small.

=== RRIP-style policies ===
RRIP-style policies are the basis for other cache replacement policies, including Hawkeye. 

==== Re-Reference Interval Prediction (RRIP) ====
RRIP is a flexible policy, proposed by Intel, which attempts to provide good scan resistance while allowing older cache lines that have not been reused to be evicted. All cache lines have a prediction value, the RRPV (re-reference prediction value), that should correlate with when the line is expected to be reused. The RRPV is usually high on insertion; if a line is not reused soon, it will be evicted to prevent scans (large amounts of data used only once) from filling the cache. When a cache line is reused the RRPV is set to zero, indicating that the line has been reused once and is likely to be reused again.

On a cache miss, the line with an RRPV equal to the maximum possible RRPV is evicted; with 3-bit values, a line with an RRPV of 23 - 1 = 7 is evicted. If no lines have this value, all RRPVs in the set are increased by 1 until one reaches it. A tie-breaker is needed, and usually, it is the first line on the left. The increase is needed to ensure that older lines are aged properly and will be evicted if they are not reused.

===== Static RRIP (SRRIP) =====
SRRIP inserts lines with an RRPV value of maxRRPV; a line which has just been inserted will be the most likely to be evicted on a cache miss.

===== Bimodal RRIP (BRRIP) =====
SRRIP performs well normally, but suffers when the working set is much larger than the cache size and causes cache thrashing. This is remedied by inserting lines with an RRPV value of maxRRPV most of the time, and inserting lines with an RRPV value of maxRRPV - 1 randomly with a low probability. This causes some lines to &quot;stick&quot; in the cache, and helps prevent thrashing. BRRIP degrades performance, however, on non-thrashing accesses. SRRIP performs best when the working set is smaller than the cache, and BRRIP performs best when the working set is larger than the cache.

===== Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) =====

DRRIP uses set dueling to select whether to use SRRIP or BRRIP. It dedicates a few sets (typically 32) to use SRRIP and another few to use BRRIP, and uses a policy counter which monitors set performance to determine which policy will be used by the rest of the cache.

=== Policies approximating Bélády&#x27;s algorithm ===
Bélády&#x27;s algorithm is the optimal cache replacement policy, but it requires knowledge of the future to evict lines that will be reused farthest in the future. A number of replacement policies have been proposed which attempt to predict future reuse distances from past access patterns, allowing them to approximate the optimal replacement policy. Some of the best-performing cache replacement policies attempt to imitate Bélády&#x27;s algorithm.

==== Hawkeye ====
Hawkeye attempts to emulate Bélády&#x27;s algorithm by using past accesses by a PC to predict whether the accesses it produces generate cache-friendly (used later) or cache-averse accesses (not used later). It samples a number of non-aligned cache sets, uses a history of length formula_6 and emulates Bélády&#x27;s algorithm on these accesses. This allows the policy to determine which lines should have been cached and which should not, predicting whether an instruction is cache-friendly or cache-averse. This data is then fed into an RRIP; accesses from cache-friendly instructions have a lower RRPV value (likely to be evicted later), and accesses from cache-averse instructions have a higher RRPV value (likely to be evicted sooner). The RRIP backend makes the eviction decisions. The sampled cache and OPT generator set the initial RRPV value of the inserted cache lines. Hawkeye won the CRC2 cache championship in 2017, and Harmony is an extension of Hawkeye which improves prefetching performance.
==== Mockingjay ====
Mockingjay tries to improve on Hawkeye in several ways. It drops the binary prediction, allowing it to make more fine-grained decisions about which cache lines to evict, and leaves the decision about which cache line to evict for when more information is available.

Mockingjay keeps a sampled cache of unique accesses, the PCs that produced them, and their timestamps. When a line in the sampled cache is accessed again, the time difference will be sent to the reuse distance predictor. The RDP uses temporal difference learning, where the new RDP value will be increased or decreased by a small number to compensate for outliers; the number is calculated as formula_7. If the value has not been initialized, the observed reuse distance is inserted directly. If the sampled cache is full and a line needs to be discarded, the RDP is instructed that the PC that last accessed it produces streaming accesses.

On an access or insertion, the estimated time of reuse (ETR) for this line is updated to reflect the predicted reuse distance. On a cache miss, the line with the highest ETR value is evicted. Mockingjay has results which are close to the optimal Bélády&#x27;s algorithm.

=== Machine-learning policies ===
A number of policies have attempted to use perceptrons, markov chains or other types of machine learning to predict which line to evict. Learning augmented algorithms also exist for cache replacement.
=== Other policies ===

==== Low inter-reference recency set (LIRS) ====

LIRS is a page replacement algorithm with better performance than LRU and other, newer replacement algorithms. Reuse distance is a metric for dynamically ranking accessed pages to make a replacement decision. LIRS addresses the limits of LRU by using recency to evaluate inter-reference recency (IRR) to make a replacement decision.

In the diagram, X indicates that a block is accessed at a particular time. If block A1 is accessed at time 1, its recency will be 0; this is the first-accessed block and the IRR will be 1, since it predicts that A1 will be accessed again in time 3. In time 2, since A4 is accessed, the recency will become 0 for A4 and 1 for A1; A4 is the most recently accessed object, and the IRR will become 4. At time 10, the LIRS algorithm will have two sets: an LIR set = {A1, A2} and an HIR set = {A3, A4, A5}. At time 10, if there is access to A4 a miss occurs; LIRS will evict A5 instead of A2 because of its greater recency.

==== Adaptive replacement cache ====
Adaptive replacement cache (ARC) constantly balances between LRU and LFU to improve the combined result. It improves SLRU by using information about recently-evicted cache items to adjust the size of the protected and probationary segments to make the best use of available cache space.

==== Clock with adaptive replacement ====
Clock with adaptive replacement (CAR) combines the advantages of ARC and Clock. CAR performs comparably to ARC, and outperforms LRU and Clock. Like ARC, CAR is self-tuning and requires no user-specified parameters.

==== Multi-queue ====
The multi-queue replacement (MQ) algorithm was developed to improve the performance of a second-level buffer cache, such as a server buffer cache, and was introduced in a paper by Zhou, Philbin, and Li. The MQ cache contains an &quot;m&quot; number of LRU queues: Q0, Q1, ..., Q&quot;m&quot;-1. The value of &quot;m&quot; represents a hierarchy based on the lifetime of all blocks in that queue.

==== Pannier ====
Pannier is a container-based flash caching mechanism which identifies containers whose blocks have variable access patterns. Pannier has a priority-queue-based survival-queue structure to rank containers based on their survival time, which is proportional to live data in the container.

==Static analysis==
Static analysis determines which accesses are cache hits or misses to indicate the worst-case execution time of a program. An approach to analyzing properties of LRU caches is to give each block in the cache an &quot;age&quot; (0 for the most recently used) and compute intervals for possible ages. This analysis can be refined to distinguish cases where the same program point is accessible by paths that result in misses or hits. An efficient analysis may be obtained by abstracting sets of cache states by antichains which are represented by compact binary decision diagrams.

LRU static analysis does not extend to pseudo-LRU policies. According to computational complexity theory, static-analysis problems posed by pseudo-LRU and FIFO are in higher complexity classes than those for LRU.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command that determines the settings of a mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created files. It may also affect how the file permissions are changed explicitly. is also a function that sets the mask, or it may refer to the mask itself, which is formally known as the file mode creation mask. The mask is a grouping of bits, each of which restricts how its corresponding permission is set for newly created files. The bits in the mask may be changed by invoking the command.

==Overview==
In Unix-like systems, each file has a set of attributes that control who can read, write or execute it. When a program creates a file, the file permissions are restricted by the mask. If the mask has a bit set to &quot;1&quot;, then the corresponding initial file permission will be &quot;disabled&quot;. A bit set to &quot;0&quot; in the mask means that the corresponding permission will be &quot;determined by the program&quot; and the file system. In other words, the mask acts as a last-stage filter that strips away permissions as a file is created; each bit that is set to a &quot;1&quot; strips away its corresponding permission. Permissions may be changed later by users and programs using codice_2.

Each program (technically called a process) has its own mask and is able to change its settings using a function call. When the process is a shell, the mask is set with the command. When a shell or process launches a new process, the child process inherits the mask from its parent process. Generally, the mask only affects file permissions during the creation of new files and has no effect when file permissions are changed in existing files; however, the command will check the mask when the mode options are specified using symbolic mode and a reference to a class of users is not specified.

The mask is stored as a group of bits. It may be represented as binary, octal or symbolic notation. The command allows the mask to be set as octal (e.g. ) or symbolic (e.g. ) notation.

The command is used with Unix-like operating systems, and the function is defined in the POSIX.1 specification.

==History==
The mask, the command and the function were not part of the original implementation of UNIX. The operating system evolved in a relatively small computer-center environment, where security was not an issue. It eventually grew to serve hundreds of users from different organizations. At first, developers made creation modes for key files more restrictive, especially for cases of actual security breaches, but this was not a general solution. The mask and the command were introduced around 1978, in the seventh edition of the operating system, so it could allow sites, groups and individuals to choose their own defaults. The mask has since been implemented in most, if not all, of the contemporary implementations of Unix-like operating systems.

==Shell command==
In a shell, the mask is set by using the command. The syntax of the command is:

umask [-S ] [maskExpression]
(The items within the brackets are optional.)

===Displaying the current mask===
If the command is invoked without any arguments, it will display the current mask. The output will be in either octal or symbolic notation, depending on the OS.

In most shells, but not the C shell, the argument (i.e. ) will instruct to display using symbolic notation. For example:

$ umask # display current value (as octal)
0022
$ umask -S # display current value symbolically
u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
===Setting the mask using octal notation===
If the command is invoked with an octal argument, it will directly set the bits of the mask to that argument:

$ umask 007 # set the mask to 007
$ umask # display the mask (in octal)
0007 # 0 - special permissions (setuid | setgid | sticky )
 # 0 - (u)ser/owner part of mask
 # 0 - (g)roup part of mask
 # 7 - (o)thers/not-in-group part of mask
$ umask -S # display the mask symbolically
u=rwx,g=rwx,o=
If fewer than 4 digits are entered, leading zeros are assumed. An error will result if the argument is not a valid octal number or if it has more than 4 digits. The three rightmost octal digits address the &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;group&quot; and &quot;other&quot; user classes respectively. If a fourth digit is present, the leftmost (high-order) digit addresses three additional attributes, the &quot;setuid bit&quot;, the &quot;setgid bit&quot; and the &quot;sticky bit&quot;.

====Octal codes====
===Setting the mask using symbolic notation===
When is invoked using symbolic notation, it will modify or set the flags as specified by the &quot;maskExpression&quot; with the syntax:
Note that this syntax does not work when using the C shell due to the different behaviour of its built-in command.

Multiple &quot;maskExpressions&quot; are separated by commas.

A space terminates the &quot;maskExpression&quot;(s).

The permissions are applied to different user classes:
The &quot;operator&quot; specifies how the permission modes of the mask should be adjusted.
The &quot;permission-symbols&quot; indicate which file permission settings are to be allowed or prohibited by the mask.
For example:

umask u-w

Prohibit write permission from being set for the user. The rest of the flags in the mask are unchanged.

Example of multiple changes:

umask u-w,g=r,o+r
This would set the mask so that it would:
# prohibit the write permission from being set for the user, while leaving the rest of the flags unchanged; 
# allow the read permission to be enabled for the group, while prohibiting write and execute permission for the group;
# allow the read permission to be enabled for others, while leaving the rest of the other flags unchanged.

===Command line examples===
Here are more examples of using the command to change the mask:

Example showing effect of :

$ umask -S # Show the (frequently initial) setting 
u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
$ gcc hello.c # compile and create executable file a.out
$ ls -l a.out 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 me developer 6010 Jul 10 17:10 a.out 
$ # the umask prohibited Write permission for Group and Others
$ ls &gt; listOfMyFiles # output file created by redirection does not attempt to set eXecute
$ ls -l listOfMyFiles
-rw-r--r-- 1 me developer 6010 Jul 10 17:14 listOfMyFiles 
$ # the umask prohibited Write permission for Group and Others
$ umask u-w # remove user write permission from umask
$ umask -S
u=rx,g=rx,o=rx
$ ls &gt; protectedListOfFiles
$ ls -l protectedListOfFiles
-r--r--r-- 1 me developer 6010 Jul 10 17:15 protectedListOfFiles 
$ rm protectedListOfFiles
override r--r--r-- me/developer for protectedListOfFiles? 
$ # warning that protectedListOfFiles is not writable, answering Y will remove the file
$ umask g-r,o-r # removed group read and other read from mask
$ umask -S
u=rx,g=x,o=x
$ ls &gt; secretListOfFiles
$ ls -l secretListOfFiles

==Mask effect==
The mask is applied whenever a file is created. If the mask has a bit set to &quot;1&quot;, that means the corresponding file permission will always be &quot;disabled&quot; when files are subsequently created. A bit set to &quot;0&quot; in the mask means that the corresponding permission will be &quot;determined by the requesting process&quot; and the OS when files are subsequently created. In other words, the mask acts as a last-stage filter that strips away permissions as a file is created; each bit that is set to a &quot;1&quot; strips away that corresponding permission for the file.

===How the mask is applied=== 
Programmatically, the mask is applied by the OS by first negating (complementing) the mask, and then performing a logical AND with the requested file mode. In the [probably] first UNIX manual to describe its function, the manual says,

===Exceptions===
Many operating systems do not allow a file to be created with execute permissions. In these environments, newly created files will always have execute permission disabled for all users.

The mask is generally only applied to functions that create a new file; however, there are exceptions. For example, when using UNIX and GNU versions of to set the permissions of a file, and symbolic notation is used, and no user is specified, then the mask is applied to the requested permissions before they are applied to the file. For example:

$ umask 0000
$ chmod +rwx filename
$ ls -l filename
-rwxrwxrwx filename
$ umask 0022
$ chmod +rwx filename
$ ls -l filename
-rwxr-xr-x filename
==Processes==
Each process has its own mask, which is applied whenever the process creates a new file. When a shell, or any other process, spawns a new process, the child process inherits the mask from its parent process. When the process is a shell, the mask is changed by the command. As with other processes, any process launched from the shell inherits that shell&#x27;s mask.

==Mount option==
In the Linux kernel, the codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7 file system drivers support a codice_1 mount option, which controls how the disk information is mapped to permissions. This is not the same as the per-process mask described above, although the permissions are calculated in a similar way. Some of these file system drivers also support separate masks for files and directories, using mount options such as codice_9.

<doc id="954286" wikidata="Q7366931" url="?curid=954286" title="Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell">
<text>Rory O&#x27;Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell (Irish: &quot;Rudhraighe&quot; &quot;Ó Domhnaill, 1d Iarla na Tír Chonaill&quot;; 1575 – 28 July 1608), was an Irish Gaelic lord and the last King of Tyrconnell prior to the Plantation of Ulster. He succeeded his older brother Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell and in 1603 became the first to be styled the Earl of Tyrconnell. In 1607, following their defeat in the Nine Years&#x27; War, Tyrconnell and his wartime ally Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, fled Ireland for mainland Europe. Tyrconnell died of a fever shortly after settling in Rome.

==Early life==
Born in 1575, Rory O&#x27;Donnell was the second son of Irish lord Sir Hugh McManus O&#x27;Donnell and his second wife Iníon Dubh. Hugh McManus reigned as Chief of the Name and Lord of Tyrconnell from 1566 until his 1592 abdication in favour of Rory&#x27;s older brother Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell. Iníon Dubh was a Scottish aristocrat of Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg.

Rory&#x27;s full-siblings included Hugh Roe, Nuala, Manus, Mary, and Cathbarr. Rory&#x27;s older half-siblings (children of his father&#x27;s first wife) included Donal and Siobhán.

In July 1588, Sir Hugh promised Rory as a pledge for good behaviour.

== Nine Years&#x27; War ==
Rory O&#x27;Donnell became tanist upon his brother Hugh Roe&#x27;s 1592 inauguration as Lord of Tyrconnell. Rory fought in the Nine Years&#x27; War, though his role is largely overshadowed by Hugh Roe&#x27;s leadership.

In 1598, Rory was engaged by the governor of Connacht, Sir Conyers Clifford, in a plot against his brother. When this news reached Hugh Roe, he put Rory in chains for an unspecified time. It seems their relationship improved by 1600.

On 9 October 1600, Rory&#x27;s distant cousin and brother-in-law, loyalist Niall Garve O&#x27;Donnell, seized Lifford from him with the help of English forces. Despite attempts from Rory and Hugh Roe to retake Lifford, they were unsuccessful. This culminated in a battle on 24 October, in which Niall fatally wounded Rory&#x27;s younger brother Manus. Rory and Niall engaged in single combat, though both were lucky to leave the battle with their lives.

That December, Hugh Roe marched to Mayo, leaving Rory temporarily in charge. According to historian Emmett O&#x27;Byrne, &quot;his tenure was not distinguished&quot;, as during this time, Niall&#x27;s forces continued to gain momentum.

The Irish confederacy suffered a major defeat at Kinsale. Rory became acting Chief when Hugh Roe left to seek desperately-needed reinforcements from Spain. Rory led the clan back to Connacht and maintained guerilla warfare, with the help of his ally Brian Oge O&#x27;Rourke. However, the two men failed in their attempt to take back power in Connacht. They lost Ballyshannon to Niall in Spring 1602, and could not prevent Oliver Lambart from entering Sligo in June. Rory and O&#x27;Rourke also argued amongst themselves.

Hugh Roe died in Spain on . In December, Rory O&#x27;Donnell submitted to Lord Deputy Mountjoy at Athlone.

== Head of the clan O&#x27;Donnell ==
Upon his older brother&#x27;s death, O&#x27;Donnell succeeded him as King of Tyrconnell and Chief of the Clan O&#x27;Donnell. However, it appears he was never formally inaugurated with the traditional Gaelic rites. Having submitted in London to the newly crowned King James I, Rory, under the policy of surrender and regrant was required to renounce his traditional titles and was in return created as Earl of Tyrconnell per letters patent of 4 September 1603, with the subsidiary title Baron of Donegal reserved for his heir apparent. He was further granted the territorial Lordship of Tyrconnell per letters patent of 10 February 1604.

A 1614 Hiberno-Latin history of Donegal Abbey, however, criticized the title of Earl as, &quot;how inferior to that with which the Prince of Tyrconnell used to be acclaimed on the sacred rock of Kilmacrenan!&quot;
==Flight of the Earls==

There was much fury in Ireland and England that he and Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, had been treated so gingerly after allegedly committing treason (this became known as the Sham Plot), but time was on the side of the English authorities. On 14 September 1607, both Earls set sail from Lough Swilly with their families and followers for eventual exile in the Spanish Netherlands and Rome.

The journey was difficult and harsh, and conditions on their boat were extremely poor. The Earls arrived in France, not Spain as expected, then made their way north to the Spanish Netherlands. They eventually arrived in Rome on 29 April 1608. Tyrconnell and Tyrone were welcomed to Rome by a guard of cardinals. The next day, they met with Pope Paul V, who gave them and their families a small pension.

=== Rome ===
In early July 1608, Tyrconnell travelled to Ostia, a coastal town fifteen miles west of Rome, in order to &quot;make holiday and take a change of air&quot;. He was accompanied by his brother Cathbarr, Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 4th Baron Dungannon, and Donal O’Carroll, Vicar General of Killaloe. Unfortunately, the men &quot;all agreed that that particular place [was] one of the worst and most unhealthy for the climate in all Italy&quot;. Tyrconnell became ill on 18 July, and shortly afterwards he died in Rome on 28 July 1608. He was buried the next day in San Pietro in Montorio. His magnificent funeral was funded by the Marqués de Aytona, Spanish ambassador to Rome, who provided Tyrconnell&#x27;s younger sister Nuala with 300 crowns.

==Family==
Around Christmas 1606, Tyrconnell married Bridget FitzGerald, daughter of the 12th Earl of Kildare, by whom he had two children: Hugh and Mary. Tyrconnell left his wife behind in Ireland during his flight. After his death, Bridget married the 1st Viscount Barnewall (1592–1663), with whom she had five sons and four daughters that survived him.

Lord Tyrconnell&#x27;s only son, Hugh, was three weeks shy of his first birthday when the Earls sailed from Lough Swilly, and was raised in Louvain, Spanish Flanders. In time he joined the service of the King of Spain, and was killed in action when his ship engaged a French vessel in August or September 1642 and caught fire. He succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell, but left no offspring; the title of Earl would have descended to his first cousin Domhnall Oge&#x27;s line were it not meanwhile attainted in 1614.

Lord Tyrconnell&#x27;s youngest child, Mary Stuart O&#x27;Donnell, left a more lasting impression on posterity. She was born in England around 1607. After her father&#x27;s death, King James VI and I, the first Stuart King of England, gave her the name Stuart in recognition of their common Stuart ancestry – they were ninth cousins – hence she was known as Mary &quot;Stuart&quot; O&#x27;Donnell. She was descended, through her mother, from the Stuarts. Mary was raised by her mother in the Kildare lands in Ireland until she was twelve years old. In 1619, Mary was sent to live with her grandmother, Lady Kildare, in London, where Lady Kildare aimed to educate the girl and make her her heiress.

== Portraiture ==
Lord Tyrconnell is depicted as part of a fresco in the Vatican. He stands next to Hugh O&#x27;Neill during the 1608 canonization of Frances of Rome by Pope Paul V. It was painted circa 1610.

According to historian Francis Martin O&#x27;Donnell, many historians believe that the figure next to O&#x27;Neill is actually a Spanish ambassador - either Francisco de Moncada or his father Gastón. Francis Martin O&#x27;Donnell argues that the figure lacks Francisco&#x27;s distinctive facial hair and portly appearance, and looks too young to depict Gastón, who was in his mid-50s at the time. The figure also lacks the ornate clothing an ambassador would be required to wear during such a ceremony. Therefore, it is most likely that the figure standing next to O&#x27;Neill is fellow Irish earl Rory O&#x27;Donnell.

<text>Stephen de Pencester was Warden of the Cinque Ports when the first authoritative list of Cinque Ports Confederation Members was produced in 1293.

Pencester was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports for 32 years, his tenure finishing in 1299 when the Baron de Burghersh was elected; it is reasonable to assume he began his administration in 1267.

Pencester was married to Margerie (a great-granddaughter of Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent). When she inherited the parish of Tunstall in Kent. They resided both at Allington and Penshurst.

When Pencester died in 1303, Margerie then married to Robert de Orreby. After her death, an inquest found that she had inherited the parish of Tunstall and this parish passed to her daughters (of Pencester): Joane, the wife of Henry de Cobham, of Rundale, and Alice, wife of John de Columbers.

An effigy of Pencester is on display in Penshurst village&#x27;s St John the Baptist church, in the Sidney family chapel, and the Pencester-owned Penshurst Place estate before the Baron&#x27;s Hall was built by the new owner of the estate, Sir John de Pulteney in 1341.

<text>Live coding, sometimes referred to as on-the-fly programming, just in time programming and conversational programming, makes programming an integral part of the running program.

It is most prominent as a performing arts form and a creativity technique centred upon the writing of source code and the use of interactive programming in an improvised way. Live coding is often used to create sound and image based digital media, as well as light systems, improvised dance and poetry, though is particularly prevalent in computer music usually as improvisation, although it could be combined with algorithmic composition. Typically, the process of writing source code is made visible by projecting the computer screen in the audience space, with ways of visualising the code an area of active research. Live coding techniques are also employed outside of performance, such as in producing sound for film or audiovisual work for interactive art installations. Also, the interconnection between computers makes possible to realize this practice networked in group.

The figure of live coder is who performs the act of live coding, usually &quot;artists who want to learn to code, and coders who want to express themselves&quot; or in terms of Wang &amp; Cook the &quot;programmer/performer/composer&quot;.

Live coding is also an increasingly popular technique in programming-related lectures and conference presentations, and has been described as a &quot;best practice&quot; for computer science lectures by Mark Guzdial.

== Techniques ==
A range of techniques have been developed and appropriated for the purposes of live coding.

=== Representation and manipulation of time ===
The specific affordances of time-based media and live interaction with code has led to a number of novel developments and uses in programming language design. Through mutual embedding of imperative and declarative subsystems, the programming language SuperCollider permitted to build a library that allows incomplete and provisional specifications which can be rewritten at runtime.

The ChucK language introduced an approach to &quot;strongly timed&quot; programming in 2002, embedding precision timing into control flow through a concise syntax.

&quot;Temporal recursion&quot; was a term initially coined in relation to the Impromptu programming environment. Technical elements within a programming environment continue to locate compressors and recursion solutions, but timing had been a major issue. While the general form of a temporal recursion, being any asynchronous function recursion through time, is available to any event driven system, Impromptu has placed a special emphasis on this particular design pattern, making it the centre piece of the concurrency architecture on that platform. Temporal recursion had repeatedly been used in SuperCollider and has since been implemented in the Fluxus environment.

Another functional approach to the representation of time is shown in the Tidal pattern DSL, which represents patterns as combinators operating over functions of time, similar to techniques in functional reactive programming.

=== Multi-user programming and shared memory ===
Multi-user programming has developed in the context of group music-making, through the long development of the &quot;Republic&quot; system developed and employed by members of the network band &quot;PowerBooks Unplugged&quot;. Republic is built into the SuperCollider language, and allows participants to collaboratively write live code that is distributed across the network of computers. There are similar efforts in other languages, such as the distributed tuple space used in the Impromptu language. Additionally Overtone, Impromptu and Extempore support multi-user sessions, in which any number of programmers can intervene across the network in a given runtime process. The practice of writing code in group can be done in the same room through a local network or from remote places accessing a common server. Terms like laptop band, laptop orchestra, collaborative live coding or collective live coding are used to frame a networked live coding practice both in a local or remote way.

== Organizations ==
TOPLAP (The (Temporary|Transnational|Terrestrial|Transdimensional) Organisation for the (Promotion|Proliferation|Permanence|Purity) of Live (Algorithm|Audio|Art|Artistic) Programming) is an informal organization formed in February 2004 to bring together the various communities that had formed around live coding environments. The TOPLAP manifesto asserts several requirements for a TOPLAP compliant performance, in particular that performers&#x27; screens should be projected and not hidden.

On-the-fly promotes live coding practice since 2020. This is a project co-funded by the Creative European program and run in Hangar, ZKM, Ljudmila and Creative Code Utrecht.

== Research ==
A number of research projects and research groups have been created to explore live coding, often taking interdisciplinary approaches bridging the humanities and sciences. First efforts to both develop live coding systems and embed the emerging field in the broader theoretical context happened in the research project Artistic Interactivity in Hybrid Networks from 2005 to 2008, funded by the German Research Foundation.

Further, the Live Coding Research Network was funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council for two years from February 2014, supporting a range of activities including symposia, workshops and an annual international conference called International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC).

<doc id="954307" wikidata="Q844456" url="?curid=954307" title="Vibrating structure gyroscope">
<text>A vibrating structure gyroscope (VSG), defined by the IEEE as a Coriolis vibratory gyroscope (CVG), is a gyroscope that uses a vibrating (as opposed to rotating) structure as its orientation reference. A vibrating structure gyroscope functions much like the halteres of flies (insects in the order Diptera).

The underlying physical principle is that a vibrating object tends to continue vibrating in the same plane even if its support rotates. The Coriolis effect causes the object to exert a force on its support, and by measuring this force the rate of rotation can be determined.

Vibrating structure gyroscopes are simpler and cheaper than conventional rotating gyroscopes of similar accuracy. Inexpensive vibrating structure gyroscopes manufactured with micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology are widely used in smartphones, gaming devices, cameras and many other applications.

== Theory of operation ==

Consider two proof masses vibrating in plane (as in the MEMS gyro) at frequency formula_1. The Coriolis effect induces an acceleration on the proof masses equal to formula_2, where formula_3 is a velocity and formula_4 is an angular rate of rotation. The in-plane velocity of the proof masses is given by formula_5, if the in-plane position is given by formula_6. The out-of-plane motion formula_7, induced by rotation, is given by:
:formula_8
where
:formula_9 is a mass of the proof mass,
:formula_10 is a spring constant in the out of plane direction,
:formula_4 is a magnitude of a rotation vector in the plane of and perpendicular to the driven proof mass motion.

By measuring formula_7, we can thus determine the rate of rotation formula_4.

== Implementations ==
=== Cylindrical resonator gyroscope (CRG) ===

This type of gyroscope was developed by GEC Marconi and Ferranti in the 1980s using metal alloys with attached piezoelectric elements and a single-piece piezoceramic design. Subsequently, in the 90s, CRGs with magneto-electric excitation and readout were produced by American-based Inertial Engineering, Inc. in California, and piezoceramic variants by Watson Industries. A recently patented variant by Innalabs uses a cylindrical design resonator made from Elinvar-type alloy with piezoceramic elements for excitation and pickoff at its bottom.

This technology gave a substantially increased product life (MTBF &gt; 500,000 hours); with its shock resistance (&gt;300g), it should qualify for &quot;tactical&quot; (mid-accuracy) applications.

The resonator is operated in its second-order resonant mode. The Q-factor is usually about 20,000; that predetermines its noise and angular random walks. Standing waves are elliptically-shaped oscillations with four antinodes and four nodes located circumferentially along the rim.

The angle between two adjacent antinode – nodes is 45 degrees. One of the elliptical resonant modes is excited to a prescribed amplitude. When the device rotates about its sensitive axis (along its inner stem), the resulting Coriolis forces acting on the resonator&#x27;s vibrating mass elements excite the second resonant mode. The angle between major axes of the two modes is also 45 degrees.

A closed loop drives the second resonant mode to zero, and the force required to null this mode is proportional to the input rotation rate. This control loop is designated the force-rebalanced mode.

Piezoelectric elements on the resonator produce forces and sense induced motions. This electromechanical system provides the low output noise and large dynamic range that demanding applications require, but suffers from intense acoustic noises and high overloads.

=== Piezoelectric gyroscopes ===

A piezoelectric material can be induced to vibrate, and lateral motion due to Coriolis force can be measured to produce a signal related to the rate of rotation.

=== Tuning fork gyroscope ===

This type of gyroscope uses a pair of test masses driven to resonance. Their displacement from the plane of oscillation is measured to produce a signal related to the system&#x27;s rate of rotation.

Frederick William Meredith registered a patent for such a device in 1942 while working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Further development was carried out at the RAE in 1958 by G. H. Hunt and A. E. W. Hobbs, who demonstrated drift of less than 1°/h or (2.78)°/s.

Modern variants of tactical gyros use doubled tuning forks such as those produced by American manufacturer Systron Donner in California and French manufacturer Safran Electronics &amp; Defense / Safran Group.

=== Wine-glass resonator ===

Also called a hemispherical resonator gyroscope or HRG, a wine-glass resonator uses a thin solid-state hemisphere anchored by a thick stem. The hemisphere with its stem is driven to flexural resonance and the nodal points are measured to detect rotation. There are two basic variants of such a system: one based on a rate regime of operation (&quot;force-to-rebalance mode&quot;) and another variant based on an integrating regime of operation (&quot;whole-angle mode&quot;). Usually, the latter one is used in combination with a controlled parametric excitation. It is possible to use both regimes with the same hardware, which is a feature unique to these gyroscopes.

For a single-piece design (i.e., the hemispherical cup and stem(s) form a monolithic part) made from high-purity quartz glass, it is possible to reach a Q-factor greater than 30-50 million in vacuum, so the corresponding random walks are extremely low. The Q is limited by the coating, an extremely thin film of gold or platinum, and by fixture losses. Such resonators have to be fine-tuned by ion-beam micro-erosion of the glass or by laser ablation. Engineers and researchers in several countries have been working on further improvements of these sophisticated state-of-art technologies.

Safran and Northrop Grumman are the major manufacturers of HRG.

=== Vibrating wheel gyroscope ===

A wheel is driven to rotate a fraction of a full turn about its axis. The tilt of the wheel is measured to produce a signal related to the rate of rotation.

== MEMS gyroscopes ==

Inexpensive vibrating structure microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes have become widely available. These are packaged similarly to other integrated circuits and may provide either analogue or digital outputs. In many cases, a single part includes gyroscopic sensors for multiple axes. Some parts incorporate multiple gyroscopes and accelerometers (or multiple-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers), to achieve output that has six full degrees of freedom. These units are called inertial measurement units, or IMUs. Panasonic, Robert Bosch GmbH, InvenSense, Seiko Epson, Sensonor, Hanking Electronics, STMicroelectronics, Freescale Semiconductor, and Analog Devices are major manufacturers.

Internally, MEMS gyroscopes use micro-lithographically constructed versions of one or more of the mechanisms outlined above (tuning forks, vibrating wheels, or resonant solids of various designs, i.e., similar to TFG, CRG, or HRG mentioned above).

MEMS gyroscopes are used in automotive roll-over prevention and airbag systems, image stabilization, and have many other potential applications.

== Applications of gyroscopes ==
=== Automotive ===
Automotive yaw sensors can be built around vibrating structure gyroscopes. These are used to detect error states in yaw compared to a predicted response when connected as an input to electronic stability control systems in conjunction with a steering wheel sensor. Advanced systems could conceivably offer rollover detection based on a second VSG but it is cheaper to add longitudinal and vertical accelerometers to the existing lateral one to this end.

=== Entertainment ===

The Nintendo Game Boy Advance game uses a piezoelectric gyroscope to detect rotational movement. The Sony SIXAXIS PS3 controller uses a single MEMS gyroscope to measure the sixth axis (yaw). The Nintendo Wii MotionPlus accessory uses multi-axis MEMS gyroscopes provided by InvenSense to augment the motion sensing capabilities of the Wii Remote. Most modern smartphones and gaming devices also feature MEMS gyroscopes.

=== Hobbies ===

Vibrating structure gyroscopes are commonly used in radio-controlled helicopters to help control the helicopter&#x27;s tail rotor and in radio-controlled airplanes to help keep the attitude steady during flight. They are also used in multirotor flight controllers, since multirotors are inherently aerodynamically unstable and cannot stay airborne without electronic stabilization.

=== Industrial robotics ===

Epson Robots uses a quartz MEMS gyroscope, called QMEMS, to detect and control vibrations on their robots. This helps the robots position the robot end effector with high precision in high speed and fast-deceleration motion.

=== Photography ===
Many image stabilization systems on video and still cameras employ vibrating structure gyroscopes.

=== Spacecraft orientation ===

The oscillation can also be induced and controlled in the vibrating structure gyroscope for the positioning of spacecraft such as &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot;. These small hemispherical resonator gyroscopes made of quartz glass operate in vacuum. There are also prototypes of elastically decoupled cylindrical resonator gyroscopes (CRG) made from high-purity single-crystalline sapphire. The high-purity leuko-sapphire have Q-factor an order of value higher than quartz glass used for HRG, but this material is hard and has anisotropy. They provide accurate 3 axis positioning of the spacecraft and are highly reliable over the years as they have no moving parts.

=== Other ===

The Segway Human Transporter uses a vibrating structure gyroscope made by Silicon Sensing Systems to stabilize the operator platform.

<text>Argo Records was a record label in Chicago that was established in 1955 as a division of Chess Records.

Originally the label was called Marterry, but bandleader Ralph Marterie objected, and within a couple of months the imprint was renamed Argo.

Although Chess was a blues label, the Argo division began to record jazz in 1955 and over decades attracted some big names: Gene Ammons, Kenny Burrell, Barry Harris, Illinois Jacquet, Ahmad Jamal, Ramsey Lewis, James Moody, Max Roach, Red Rodney, and Ira Sullivan.

Argo also recorded pop, blues, and calypso. Its first big hit was by Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry, whose song &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No Home&quot; came out in 1956. By 1960, rhythm and blues performers on the label included Etta James and the Dells.

Argo changed its name in 1965 to Cadet Records when the company discovered that an Argo Records already existed in the UK. As with its parent label and British Argo, the catalog is owned by Universal Music Group. Argo was one of several record labels to lose master recordings in the 2008 Universal fire.

<doc id="954324" wikidata="Q15217354" url="?curid=954324" title="Plenipotentiary">
<text>A plenipotentiary (from the Latin &quot;plenus&quot; &quot;full&quot; and &quot;potens&quot; &quot;powerful&quot;) is a diplomat who has full powers—authorization to sign a treaty or convention on behalf of a sovereign. When used as a noun more generally, the word can also refer to any person who has full powers. As an adjective, it describes something which confers full powers, such as an edict or an assignment.

==Diplomats==
Before the era of rapid international transport or essentially instantaneous communication (such as telegraphy in the mid-19th century and then radio), diplomatic mission chiefs were granted full (plenipotentiary) powers to represent their government in negotiations with their host nation. Conventionally, any representations made or agreements reached with a plenipotentiary would be recognized and complied with by their government.

Historically, the common generic term for high diplomats of the crown or state was &quot;minister&quot;. It therefore became customary to style the chiefs of full ranking missions as &quot;minister plenipotentiary&quot;. This position was roughly equivalent to the modern ambassador, a term that historically was reserved mainly for missions between the great powers and also relating to the city-state of Venice.

Permanent missions at a bilateral level were chiefly limited to relations between large, neighboring or closely allied powers, rarely to the very numerous small principalities, hardly worth the expense. Diplomatic missions were dispatched for specific tasks, such as negotiating a treaty bilaterally, or via a conference of plenipotentiaries, such as the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. In such cases, it was normal to send a representative minister empowered to cast votes. For example, in the Treaty of Paris, ending the American Revolution, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and John Jay were named &quot;minister plenipotentiary of the United States&quot; to the Netherlands, France and Spain, respectively.

By the time of the Vienna Congress (1814–15), which codified diplomatic relations, &quot;ambassador&quot; had become a common title, and was established as the only class above minister plenipotentiary. It gradually became the standard title for bilateral mission chiefs, as their ranks no longer tended to reflect the importance of the states, which came to be treated as formally equal.

In modern times, heads of state and of government, and more junior ministers and officials, can easily meet or speak with each other personally. Therefore, ambassadors do not require plenipotentiary powers, even though they are designated and accredited as &quot;extraordinary and plenipotentiary&quot;.

==Administration==
Besides diplomatic plenipotentiaries, some permanent administrators are also given plenipotentiary powers. Central governments have sometimes conferred plenipotentiary status (either formally or de facto) on territorial governors. This has been most likely to occur when the remoteness of the administered territory made it impracticable for the central government to maintain and exercise its policies, laws and initiatives directly.

There have been instances where a mandate was conferred publicly on a senior official, such as a minor member of the ruling house (sometimes with the title of viceroy), but with secret instructions drastically limiting their position&#x27;s power by conferring plenipotentiary status on a more junior administrator, possibly of lower social class or caste. Thus, the formal position held by an individual has not always been a reliable indicator of actual plenipotentiary authority.

In modern times, the plenipotentiary title has sometimes been revived; for example, for the administrators of protectorates, or in other cases of indirect rule.

Examples of plenipotentiary administration are given below.

===Colonial era===
* From 1879–1884, the explorer Henry Morton Stanley (b. 1841–d. 1904) was styled &quot;Plenipotentiary of the Committee for the Studies of Upper Congo&quot; (CEHC) (from 1882, renamed International Association of the Congo (AIC), a front for the ambitions of Belgian King Leopold II, not supported by the Belgian government. In Equatorial Africa, while military command lay with four consecutive commandants of the (leading) station at Karema, on 22 April 1884 the International Association of the Congo became the independent Congo Free State (headed, on a personal basis nit connected to the Belgian state, by Leopold II), with plenipotentiaries styled &quot;administrator-general&quot; at first.

===Pre-World War II Europe===
*After successfully suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the leader of the Austrian army Julius Jacob von Haynau was appointed plenipotentiary in order to enforce martial law in Hungary. 
* On the Greek island of Crete, after the President of the Executive Commission of the Cretan Assembly, Ioannis Sfakianakis (b. 1848–d. 1924), had exercised executive power between 20 March and 21 December 1898, having evicting the last Ottoman &quot;Wāli&quot; (Ottoman governor), a Supreme Plenipotentiary Commissioner of the (Christian protecting) Powers headed the official administration of the Cretan State instituted on 20 March 1898 (formally under Ottoman suzerainty until union with Greece was unilaterally declared on 6 October 1908):
**21 December 1898–30 September 1906: Prince George of Greece (b. 1869–d. 1959)
**1 October 1906–30 September 1911: Alexandros Zaimis (b. 1855–d. 1936)
**30 September 1911–30 May 1913: the post remained vacant but was not abolished until the island was officially incorporated into the Greece in December 1913.
*During the Russian Civil War, Karl Lander was named Plenipotentiary of the Northern Caucasus and the Don by the Soviet government to exercise this power for prosecution of rebellious Cossacks.
* In Slovakia, between 15 January 1927 and 28 June 1928 (b. 1881–d. 1939) was Minister Plenipotentiary and Administrator of the Czechoslovak government.
* In Ireland, in October 1921, the revolutionary parliament of Ireland gave Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith and Robert Barton positions of plenipotentiary to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty with Britain.

===Nazi Germany===
* Granting absolute power over a particular or general governmental matter to a single individual was a pervasive practice in the Nazi regime. Among the most prominent holders of this title in Nazi Germany were:
** Hjalmar Schacht, &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter der Kriegswirtschaft&quot; (General Plenipotentiary for War Economy) from 21 May 1935 until his resignation on 26 November 1937;
** Walther Funk, &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für die Wirtschaft&quot; (General Plenipotentiary for the Economy) from 5 February 1938 until the end of the regime in 1945;
** Fritz Sauckel, &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für den Arbeitseinsatz&quot; (General Plenipotentiary for Labor Allocation) from 21 March 1942 until the end of the regime;
** Albert Speer, &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für Rüstungsaufgaben im Vierjahresplan&quot; (General Plenipotentiary for Armament Tasks in the Four Year Plan) from 1 March 1942 until the end of the regime;
** Joseph Goebbels, &quot;Reichsbevollmächtigter für den totalen Kriegseinsatz&quot; (Reich Plenipotentiary for the Total War Effort) from 25 July 1944 until his suicide on 1 May 1945;
** Wilhelm Frick, &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für die Reichsverwaltung&quot; (General Plenipotentiary for the Reich Administration) from 21 May 1935 to his dismissal on 20 August 1943;
** Heinrich Himmler, who succeeded Frick in this position on 24 August 1943 until dismissed from all his offices on 29 April 1945. His aide, Walter Schellenberg, held the title of &quot;Sonderbevollmächtigter&quot; (Special Plenipotentiary) to Himmler.
* In the Slovak Republic (14 March 1939–4 April 1945) three consecutive German Envoys and Ministers Plenipotentiary (the old diplomatic style) formally represented the Reich in the fascist puppet state of Jozef Tiso. These were from 30 June 1939 to 29 July 1940; Manfred Freiherr von Killinger from 29 July 1940 to 19 January 1941; and Hanns Ludin from 19 January 1941 to 4 April 1945. 
* In the occupied Netherlands, under &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; (Reich Commissioner) Arthur Seyss-Inquart, German Plenipotentiaries were appointed from 1940-45 at the provincial level by the side of the regular Dutch Provincial Commissioners in Drenthe, Friesland, Gelderland, Groningen, Limburg, North Holland, Overijssel, Utrecht and South Holland, and in 1940–1944 in North Brabant and Zeeland.
* In Denmark, another country under Nazi-German occupation (9 April 1940–5 May 1945), a German protectorate was established, led by a &quot;Reichsbevollmächtigter&quot; (Reich Plenipotentiary). This was Cecil von Renthe-Fink from 9 April 1940 until he was replaced on 5 November 1942 by SS-Obergruppenführer Werner Best. Best remained in this post until the German surrender in Denmark on 5 May 1945, even though on 29 August 1943 the German military commander, Hermann von Hanneken, took over more direct administration of affairs after declaring a state of military emergency. 
* In Italy, Nazi Germany&#x27;s major European Axis ally, the government of Benito Mussolini was overthrown on 25 July 1943. Following occupation by German forces in a &quot;de facto&quot; military takeover of Italy, Mussolini was installed on 23 September 1943 as Provisional Head of State and Prime Minister of the &quot;Italian Social Republic&quot;, a fascist puppet state headquartered at Salò. The German administration was headed by &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter&quot; (General Plenipotentiary) Rudolf Rahn from 23 September 1943 to 28 April 1945. There were separate military commanders in charge of the occupation forces.
* In Hungary, after the regime of Miklós Horthy began to explore contacts with the Allies in hopes of negotiating a surrender, German forces occupied the country on 19 March 1944 and Edmund Veesenmayer was named &quot;Reichsbevollmächtigter&quot; (Reich Plenipotentiary). On 15 October 1944, when Horthy tried to sign an armistice with the Soviet Union, Veesenmayer instead forced him to abdicate as regent and name Ferenc Szálasi, leader of the Arrow Cross Party, as prime minister of a puppet regime. Veesenmeyer continued as the real power in Hungary through 4 April 1945, when the German forces were finally expelled by the Red Army.

===In Africa===
* When the empress of Ethiopia, Zauditu, succeeded to her throne, her relative Ras Tafari Makonnen was installed as her crown prince. As he subsequently became the effective ruler of the country, his title was seen as being insufficient. As a result, Zauditu then gave him the further position of regent plenipotentiary. By virtue of it, he continued to serve as the most powerful man in Ethiopia until he was given another title, that of king-under-the-empress. He held this new title until Zauditu died and he was proclaimed emperor in his own right with the regnal name of Haile Selassie.

===Since 1945===
====South Africa====
It may be impractical to hold a new referendum for each step of a series of negotiated changes, and thus ministers might ask an electorate for plenipotentiary powers in advance, as occurred in the South African apartheid referendum, 1992. Prior to the referendum, the state president F. W. de Klerk had already implemented extensive reforms (e.g., removing the Group Areas Act). His right to negotiate these reforms was questioned by other parties (e.g., Andries Treurnicht&#x27;s Conservative Party), particularly in response to the National Party&#x27;s Potchefstroom by-election defeat in February 1992. Given how heavily entrenched apartheid was in the South African legal system at the time, de Klerk needed to nullify many previous bills and pass many new ones, making a series of individual referendums impractical. Consequently, as a practical solution to the political deadlock, de Klerk held a referendum on 17 March 1992 to ask the white South African electorate to give him plenipotentiary powers.

====Russia====
On 18 May 2000, in the post-Soviet Russian Federation the title Plenipotentiary of the President was established for the appointees of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, in each of the seven federal districts created on 13 May: Dalnevostochny (Far Eastern), Privolzhsky (Volga Region), Severo-Zapadny (North Western), Sibirsky (Siberian), Tsentralny (Central), Uralsky (Ural), and Yuzhny (Southern).

<text>Caledonian Football Club was a Scottish football club from the city of Inverness, Highland. It played in the Highland Football League until 1994, when it merged with Inverness Thistle to form Caledonian Thistle, later renamed Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

==Formation==
Caledonian Football Club was formed in 1885. They were founder members of the Highland Football League in 1893 and wore strips of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. Their home ground was Telford Street Park, located beside the Caledonian Canal, and they were known by the nickname &quot;Caley&quot;.

==History==
Caledonian won the Highland Football League a record eighteen times. Another Inverness side, Clachnacuddin, equalled this record in 2004. The club&#x27;s greatest period of league and cup success was in the early 1980s when they won three successive titles under manager Alex Main, a journalist who also wrote the club&#x27;s centenary book &#x27;Caley All The Way – The First Hundred Years&#x27; in 1986. The club won the prestigious Rothmans Football Yearbook Award for outstanding non-league club in 1981–82, Rothmans describing them as one of the outstanding teams of their grade in Britain, let alone Scotland. In 1982–83 their Highland League record of won 23, drew 7, lost 0, made them the first of only two clubs in the postwar era (the other being Brora Rangers in 2014–15) to finish the season as unbeaten champions.

Caledonian, like other Highland League clubs, were prevented from making the step up to the Scottish Football League due to the lack of a pyramid system.

Despite this, they qualified for the Scottish Cup many times, knocking-out larger League clubs on a total of 19 occasions. Notable achievements included knocking out First Division Airdrieonians in 1990 and in 1992 embarking on a run to the fourth round, defeating league sides Stenhousemuir (4–1), Clyde (3–1), before taking Premier Division St Johnstone to a replay, eventually losing 3–0 in Perth in front of a crowd of 10,000.

The last Caledonian game was against Huntly on Saturday 14 May 1994 at Christie Park, Huntly. The match ended 1–1 with Wilson Robertson scoring the Caley goal.

== Kit history ==
==Merger with Inverness Thistle==
In 1993, the Scottish Football League decided to expand and restructure. This meant that two vacancies for membership would be available. Caledonian decided to apply for membership, as did city rivals Inverness Thistle. The SFL suggested that a joint application might be more successful and the boards of Caley and Thistle decided to merge. This decision was met with widespread opposition by supporters of both sides, especially by Caley fans who were confident their club could successfully bid on their own. However, an amalgamation went ahead. The new club, Caledonian Thistle (later Inverness Caledonian Thistle), were granted membership to the Third Division at the beginning of season 1994–95.

<doc id="954328" wikidata="Q106091291" url="?curid=954328" title="Ridge regression">
<text>Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering. Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems. It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).

The theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their &quot;Technometrics&quot; papers &quot;Ridge regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems&quot; and &quot;Ridge regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems&quot;. 

Ridge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.

==Overview==
In the simplest case, the problem of a near-singular moment matrix formula_1 is alleviated by adding positive elements to the diagonals, thereby decreasing its condition number. Analogous to the ordinary least squares estimator, the simple ridge estimator is then given by 
formula_2
where formula_3 is the regressand, formula_4 is the design matrix, formula_5 is the identity matrix, and the ridge parameter formula_6 serves as the constant shifting the diagonals of the moment matrix. It can be shown that this estimator is the solution to the least squares problem subject to the constraint formula_7, which can be expressed as a Lagrangian minimization:
formula_8
which shows that formula_9 is nothing but the Lagrange multiplier of the constraint. In fact, there is a one-to-one relationship between formula_10 and formula_11 and since, in practice, we do not know formula_10, we define formula_9 heuristically or find it via additional data-fitting strategies, see Determination of the Tikhonov factor. 

Note that, when formula_14, in which case the constraint is non-binding, the ridge estimator reduces to ordinary least squares. A more general approach to Tikhonov regularization is discussed below.

==History==
Tikhonov regularization was invented independently in many different contexts.
It became widely known through its application to integral equations in the works of Andrey Tikhonov and David L. Phillips. Some authors use the term Tikhonov–Phillips regularization.
The finite-dimensional case was expounded by Arthur E. Hoerl, who took a statistical approach, and by Manus Foster, who interpreted this method as a Wiener–Kolmogorov (Kriging) filter. Following Hoerl, it is known in the statistical literature as ridge regression, named after ridge analysis (&quot;ridge&quot; refers to the path from the constrained maximum).

== Tikhonov regularization ==
Suppose that for a known real matrix formula_15 and vector formula_16, we wish to find a vector formula_17 such that
formula_18
where formula_17 and formula_16 may be of different sizes and formula_15 may be non-square.

The standard approach is ordinary least squares linear regression. However, if no formula_17 satisfies the equation or more than one formula_17 does—that is, the solution is not unique—the problem is said to be ill posed. In such cases, ordinary least squares estimation leads to an overdetermined, or more often an underdetermined system of equations. Most real-world phenomena have the effect of low-pass filters in the forward direction where formula_15 maps formula_17 to formula_16. Therefore, in solving the inverse-problem, the inverse mapping operates as a high-pass filter that has the undesirable tendency of amplifying noise (eigenvalues / singular values are largest in the reverse mapping where they were smallest in the forward mapping). In addition, ordinary least squares implicitly nullifies every element of the reconstructed version of formula_17 that is in the null-space of formula_15, rather than allowing for a model to be used as a prior for formula_17.
Ordinary least squares seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals, which can be compactly written as
formula_30
where formula_31 is the Euclidean norm.

In order to give preference to a particular solution with desirable properties, a regularization term can be included in this minimization:
formula_32
for some suitably chosen Tikhonov matrix formula_33. In many cases, this matrix is chosen as a scalar multiple of the identity matrix (formula_34), giving preference to solutions with smaller norms; this is known as regularization. In other cases, high-pass operators (e.g., a difference operator or a weighted Fourier operator) may be used to enforce smoothness if the underlying vector is believed to be mostly continuous.
This regularization improves the conditioning of the problem, thus enabling a direct numerical solution. An explicit solution, denoted by formula_35, is given by
formula_36
The effect of regularization may be varied by the scale of matrix formula_37. For formula_38 this reduces to the unregularized least-squares solution, provided that (&quot;A&quot;T&quot;A&quot;)−1 exists. Note that in case of a complex matrix formula_15, as usual the transpose formula_40 has to be replaced by the Hermitian transpose formula_41.

 regularization is used in many contexts aside from linear regression, such as classification with logistic regression or support vector machines, and matrix factorization.

=== Application to existing fit results ===

Since Tikhonov Regularization simply adds a quadratic term to the objective function in optimization problems,
it is possible to do so after the unregularised optimisation has taken place.
E.g., if the above problem with formula_38 yields the solution formula_43,
the solution in the presence of formula_44 can be expressed as:
formula_45
with the &quot;regularisation matrix&quot; formula_46.

If the parameter fit comes with a covariance matrix of the estimated parameter uncertainties formula_47,
then the regularisation matrix will be
formula_48
and the regularised result will have a new covariance
formula_49

In the context of arbitrary likelihood fits, this is valid, as long as the quadratic approximation of the likelihood function is valid. This means that, as long as the perturbation from the unregularised result is small, one can regularise any result that is presented as a best fit point with a covariance matrix. No detailed knowledge of the underlying likelihood function is needed. 

===Generalized Tikhonov regularization===
For general multivariate normal distributions for formula_50 and the data error, one can apply a transformation of the variables to reduce to the case above. Equivalently, one can seek an formula_50 to minimize
formula_52
where we have used formula_53 to stand for the weighted norm squared formula_54 (compare with the Mahalanobis distance). In the Bayesian interpretation formula_55 is the inverse covariance matrix of formula_56, formula_57 is the expected value of formula_50, and formula_59 is the inverse covariance matrix of formula_50. The Tikhonov matrix is then given as a factorization of the matrix formula_61 (e.g. the Cholesky factorization) and is considered a whitening filter.

This generalized problem has an optimal solution formula_62 which can be written explicitly using the formula
formula_63
or equivalently, when &quot;Q&quot; is not a null matrix:
formula_64

==Lavrentyev regularization==
In some situations, one can avoid using the transpose formula_40, as proposed by Mikhail Lavrentyev. For example, if formula_15 is symmetric positive definite, i.e. formula_67, so is its inverse formula_68, which can thus be used to set up the weighted norm squared formula_69 in the generalized Tikhonov regularization, leading to minimizing 
formula_70
or, equivalently up to a constant term,
formula_71

This minimization problem has an optimal solution formula_62 which can be written explicitly using the formula
formula_73
which is nothing but the solution of the generalized Tikhonov problem where formula_74

The Lavrentyev regularization, if applicable, is advantageous to the original Tikhonov regularization, since the Lavrentyev matrix formula_75 can be better conditioned, i.e., have a smaller condition number, compared to the Tikhonov matrix formula_76

==Regularization in Hilbert space==
Typically discrete linear ill-conditioned problems result from discretization of integral equations, and one can formulate a Tikhonov regularization in the original infinite-dimensional context. In the above we can interpret formula_15 as a compact operator on Hilbert spaces, and formula_78 and formula_79 as elements in the domain and range of formula_15. The operator formula_81 is then a self-adjoint bounded invertible operator.

==Relation to singular-value decomposition and Wiener filter==
With formula_34, this least-squares solution can be analyzed in a special way using the singular-value decomposition. Given the singular value decomposition
formula_83
with singular values formula_84, the Tikhonov regularized solution can be expressed as
formula_85
where formula_86 has diagonal values
formula_87
and is zero elsewhere. This demonstrates the effect of the Tikhonov parameter on the condition number of the regularized problem. For the generalized case, a similar representation can be derived using a generalized singular-value decomposition.

Finally, it is related to the Wiener filter:
formula_88
where the Wiener weights are formula_89 and formula_90 is the rank of formula_15.

==Determination of the Tikhonov factor==
The optimal regularization parameter formula_92 is usually unknown and often in practical problems is determined by an &quot;ad hoc&quot; method. A possible approach relies on the Bayesian interpretation described below. Other approaches include the discrepancy principle, cross-validation, L-curve method, restricted maximum likelihood and unbiased predictive risk estimator. Grace Wahba proved that the optimal parameter, in the sense of leave-one-out cross-validation minimizes
formula_93
where formula_94 is the residual sum of squares, and formula_95 is the effective number of degrees of freedom.

Using the previous SVD decomposition, we can simplify the above expression:
formula_96
formula_97
and
formula_98

==Relation to probabilistic formulation==
The probabilistic formulation of an inverse problem introduces (when all uncertainties are Gaussian) a covariance matrix formula_99 representing the &quot;a priori&quot; uncertainties on the model parameters, and a covariance matrix formula_100 representing the uncertainties on the observed parameters. In the special case when these two matrices are diagonal and isotropic, formula_101 and formula_102, and, in this case, the equations of inverse theory reduce to the equations above, with formula_103. 

==Bayesian interpretation==
Although at first the choice of the solution to this regularized problem may look artificial, and indeed the matrix formula_37 seems rather arbitrary, the process can be justified from a Bayesian point of view. Note that for an ill-posed problem one must necessarily introduce some additional assumptions in order to get a unique solution. Statistically, the prior probability distribution of formula_78 is sometimes taken to be a multivariate normal distribution. For simplicity here, the following assumptions are made: the means are zero; their components are independent; the components have the same standard deviation formula_106. The data are also subject to errors, and the errors in formula_79 are also assumed to be independent with zero mean and standard deviation formula_108. Under these assumptions the Tikhonov-regularized solution is the most probable solution given the data and the &quot;a priori&quot; distribution of formula_78, according to Bayes&#x27; theorem.

If the assumption of normality is replaced by assumptions of homoscedasticity and uncorrelatedness of errors, and if one still assumes zero mean, then the Gauss–Markov theorem entails that the solution is the minimal unbiased linear estimator.

<doc id="954329" wikidata="Q729844" url="?curid=954329" title="Schuler tuning">
<text>Schuler tuning is a design principle for inertial navigation systems that accounts for the curvature of the Earth. An inertial navigation system, used in submarines, ships, aircraft, and other vehicles to keep track of position, determines directions with respect to three axes pointing &quot;north&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, and &quot;down&quot;. To detect the vehicle&#x27;s orientation, the system contains an &quot;inertial platform&quot; mounted on gimbals, with gyroscopes that detect motion connected to a servo system to keep it pointing in a fixed orientation in space. However, the directions &quot;north&quot;, &quot;east&quot; and &quot;down&quot; change as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth. Schuler tuning describes the conditions necessary for an inertial navigation system to keep the inertial platform always pointing &quot;north&quot;, &quot;east&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, so it gives correct directions on the near-spherical Earth. It is widely used in electronic control systems.

==Principle==
As first explained by German engineer Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum that has a period that equals the orbital period of a hypothetical satellite orbiting at the surface of Earth (about 84.4 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of Earth when its support is suddenly displaced. Such a pendulum (sometimes called a &quot;Schuler pendulum&quot;) would have a length equal to the radius of Earth. Consider a simple gravity pendulum, whose length to its center of gravity equals the radius of Earth, suspended in a uniform gravitational field of the same strength as that experienced at Earth&#x27;s surface. If suspended from the surface of Earth, the center of gravity of the pendulum bob would be at the center of Earth. If it is hanging motionless and its support is moved sideways, the bob tends to remain motionless, so the pendulum always points at the center of Earth. If such a pendulum were attached to the inertial platform of an inertial navigation system, the platform would remain level, facing &quot;north&quot;, &quot;east&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, as it was moved about on the surface of the Earth.

The Schuler period can be derived from the classic formula for the period of a pendulum:
:formula_1
where L is the mean radius of Earth in meters and g is the local acceleration of gravity in metres per second per second.

==Application==
A pendulum the length of the Earth&#x27;s radius is impractical, so Schuler tuning doesn&#x27;t use physical pendulums. Instead, the electronic control system of the inertial navigation system is modified to make the platform behave as if it were attached to a pendulum. The inertial platform is mounted on gimbals, and an electronic control system keeps it pointed in a constant direction with respect to the three axes. As the vehicle moves, the gyroscopes detect changes in orientation, and a feedback loop applies signals to torquers to rotate the platform on its gimbals to keep it pointed along the axes.

To implement Schuler tuning, the feedback loop is modified to tilt the platform as the vehicle moves in the north–south and east–west directions, to keep the platform facing &quot;down&quot;. To do this, the torquers that rotate the platform are fed a signal proportional to the vehicle&#x27;s north–south and east–west velocity. The turning rate of the torquers is equal to the velocity divided by the radius of Earth &quot;R&quot;:

:formula_2

So:

:formula_3

The acceleration is a combination of the actual vehicle acceleration and the acceleration due to gravity acting on the tilting inertial platform. It can be measured by an accelerometer mounted fixed on the platform, in either the north–south or east west direction, horizontally. So this equation can be seen as a version of the equation for a simple gravity pendulum with a length equal to the radius of Earth. The inertial platform acts as if it were attached to such a pendulum.

An inertial navigation system is tuned by letting it sit motionless for one Schuler period. If its coordinates deviate too much during the period or it does not return to its original coordinates at its end it must be tuned to the correct coordinates.

Schuler&#x27;s time constant appears in other contexts. Suppose a tunnel is dug from one end of the Earth to the other end straight through its center. A stone dropped in such a tunnel oscillates harmonically with Schuler&#x27;s time constant. It can also be proved that the time is the same constant for a tunnel that is not through the center of Earth. Such a tunnel has to be an Earth-centered ellipse, the same shape as the path of the stone. These thought experiments (or rather the results of the corresponding calculations) rely on an assumption of uniform density throughout the Earth. Since the density is not actually uniform, the &quot;true&quot; periods would deviate from Schuler&#x27;s time constant.

<text>Cadet Records was an American record label that began as Argo Records in 1955 as the jazz subsidiary of Chess Records. Argo changed its name in 1965 to Cadet to avoid confusion with the similarly named label in the UK. Cadet stopped releasing records around 1974, when its artists were moved to Chess.

There was also Cadet Concept Records, for rock and more adventurous music, such as the Rotary Connection, and the experimental psychedelic &quot;Electric Mud&quot; album by Muddy Waters. The label had a Top 20 hit in 1968 with the single &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; by the British band Status Quo through a licensing arrangement with Pye Records in London. A St. Louis band known as The Truth a.k.a. The Acid Sette were signed and recorded for this label under the guidance of Abner Spector.

The masters are now owned by Universal Music.

==Discography (1965–1975)==
===Continuation of the Argo 600 Jazz Series===
Cadet was established in 1965 following a name change of the Argo label. When the name was changed, a new logo of a chessman&#x27;s horse was introduced to replace the previous chess piece logo. Cadet continued the Argo 600 Jazz series and the 4000 Blues series.
===Continuation of the Argo 4000 Blues Series===
===Cadet Concept===
Cadet Concept was established by Marshall Chess in 1967 with the first album by Rotary Connection and issued five albums by the group out of the 18 albums released on the label up until 1970 as well as featuring British band Status Quo, saxophonist John Klemmer and blues legends Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf.
===GRT consolidated Chess/Cadet album discography (1971–1975)===
Following the death of Leonard Chess in 1971, Chess Records was purchased by General Recorded Tape, GRT Records, which consolidated both the Chess and Cadet labels into a single labeling number sequence and used the artists and labels until 1975.

<doc id="954333" wikidata="Q4951625" url="?curid=954333" title="Box topology">
<text>In topology, the cartesian product of topological spaces can be given several different topologies. One of the more natural choices is the box topology, where a base is given by the Cartesian products of open sets in the component spaces. Another possibility is the product topology, where a base is also given by the Cartesian products of open sets in the component spaces, but only finitely many of which can be unequal to the entire component space.

While the box topology has a somewhat more intuitive definition than the product topology, it satisfies fewer desirable properties. In particular, if all the component spaces are compact, the box topology on their Cartesian product will not necessarily be compact, although the product topology on their Cartesian product will always be compact. In general, the box topology is finer than the product topology, although the two agree in the case of direct products (or when all but finitely many of the factors are trivial).

==Definition==
Given formula_1 such that

:formula_2

or the (possibly infinite) Cartesian product of the topological spaces formula_3, indexed by formula_4, the box topology on formula_1 is generated by the base

:formula_6

The name &quot;box&quot; comes from the case of R&quot;n&quot;, in which the basis sets look like boxes. The set formula_7 endowed with the box topology is sometimes denoted by formula_8 

==Properties==

Box topology on R&quot;ω&quot;:

* The box topology is completely regular
* The box topology is neither compact nor connected
* The box topology is not first countable (hence not metrizable)
* The box topology is not separable
* The box topology is paracompact (and hence normal and completely regular) if the continuum hypothesis is true
=== Example — failure of continuity ===
The following example is based on the Hilbert cube. Let R&quot;ω&quot; denote the countable cartesian product of R with itself, i.e. the set of all sequences in R. Equip R with the standard topology and R&quot;ω&quot; with the box topology. Define:

:formula_9

So all the component functions are the identity and hence continuous, however we will show &quot;f&quot; is not continuous. To see this, consider the open set 

:formula_10

Suppose &quot;f&quot; were continuous. Then, since:

:formula_11

there should exist formula_12 such that formula_13 But this would imply that 

:formula_14

which is false since formula_15 for formula_16 Thus &quot;f&quot; is not continuous even though all its component functions are.

=== Example — failure of compactness ===
Consider the countable product formula_17 where for each &quot;i&quot;, formula_18 with the discrete topology. The box topology on formula_1 will also be the discrete topology. Since discrete spaces are compact if and only if they are finite, we immediately see that formula_1 is not compact, even though its component spaces are. 

formula_1 is not sequentially compact either: consider the sequence formula_22 given by 
:formula_23
Since no two points in the sequence are the same, the sequence has no limit point, and therefore formula_1 is not sequentially compact.

===Convergence in the box topology===
Topologies are often best understood by describing how sequences converge. In general, a Cartesian product of a space formula_1 with itself over an indexing set formula_26 is precisely the space of functions from formula_26 to formula_1&quot;,&quot; denoted formula_29. The product topology yields the topology of pointwise convergence; sequences of functions converge if and only if they converge at every point of formula_26.

Because the box topology is finer than the product topology, convergence of a sequence in the box topology is a more stringent condition. Assuming formula_1 is Hausdorff, a sequence formula_32 of functions in formula_33 converges in the box topology to a function formula_34 if and only if it converges pointwise to formula_35 and 
there is a finite subset formula_36 and there is an formula_37 such that for all formula_38 the sequence formula_39 in formula_1 is constant for all formula_41. In other words, the sequence formula_39 is eventually constant for nearly all formula_43 and in a uniform way.

==Comparison with product topology==

The basis sets in the product topology have almost the same definition as the above, &quot;except&quot; with the qualification that &quot;all but finitely many&quot; &quot;Ui&quot; are equal to the component space &quot;Xi&quot;. The product topology satisfies a very desirable property for maps &quot;fi&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Xi&quot; into the component spaces: the product map &quot;f&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;X&quot; defined by the component functions &quot;fi&quot; is continuous if and only if all the &quot;fi&quot; are continuous. As shown above, this does not always hold in the box topology. This actually makes the box topology very useful for providing counterexamples—many qualities such as compactness, connectedness, metrizability, etc., if possessed by the factor spaces, are not in general preserved in the product with this topology.

<text>Checker Records is a defunct record label that was started in 1952 as a subsidiary of Chess Records in Chicago, Illinois. The label was founded by the Chess brothers, Leonard and Phil, who ran the label until they sold it to General Recorded Tape (GRT) in 1969, shortly before Leonard&#x27;s death.

The label released recordings by mostly African American artists and groups. Checker&#x27;s releases cover a wide range of genres including blues (Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II), rhythm and blues (Sax Mallard, Jimmy McCracklin), doo-wop (The Flamingos, The Moonglows), gospel (Aretha Franklin, Five Blind Boys of Mississippi), rock and roll (Bo Diddley, Dale Hawkins), and soul (Gene Chandler).

The label was discontinued in 1971 following GRT&#x27;s consolidation of the Chess catalogs. As with Cadet and Chess, the label&#x27;s catalog is now owned by Universal Music Group and releases from the Checker catalog are released by Geffen Records and Chess.

== History ==
Due to the recent expansion of Chess Records, as well as to achieve greater airplay for singles, the Chess brothers opened up a subsidiary label named Checker. The first 45/78 rpm single released by the label was &quot;Slow Caboose&quot; b/w &quot;Darling, Let&#x27;s Give Love a Chance&quot; by Sax Mallard and his Orchestra, which was released as Checker 750 in April 1952.

The label&#x27;s most popular artist, in the label&#x27;s early years, was Little Walter, who had ten songs released by Checker that made the Top Ten of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Rhythm &amp; Blues Records charts. Among those ten was &quot;Juke&quot; which topped the charts and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.

Checker released several singles by well-established blues artists such as Elmore James, Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup (credited as Perry Lee Crudup), and Memphis Minnie, none of which sold well. One well-established blues artist that did manage to make a hit on Checker was Sonny Boy Williamson II, who charted with &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Me Talkin&#x27;&quot; (number 3) in 1955, &quot;Keep It to Yourself&quot; (number 14) in 1956, and &quot;Help Me&quot; (number 24) in 1963.

On March 2, 1955, the Chess brothers recorded their first rock and roll artist, Bo Diddley. From this session came Bo&#x27;s self-titled debut single on Checker, which topped the R&amp;B charts and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. Another one of Bo Diddley&#x27;s Checker singles, &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;, was inducted in 2010. In 1957, Checker cracked into the rockabilly market with Dale Hawkins, who had a crossover hit with &quot;Susie Q&quot;, although he could not repeat the single&#x27;s success.

In 1958, Checker released its first 12&quot; 33⅓ rpm LP record, &quot;The Best of Little Walter&quot;, which was released as Checker LP-1428.

== Discography==
The original Checker LP series started with six albums released as part of the Chess 1425 album series before switching to the 2970 series in 1959 and continued until 1970.

<text>Inverness Thistle Football Club was a football club playing in the city of Inverness in northern Scotland.

==Formation and timeline==

They were members of the Highland Football League, winning the championship eight times, including its inaugural season: 1893–94.

They set a postwar record for the heaviest scoring in a Highland League season, with 124 goals (an average of 4.13 per game) in the 1969–70 season, which stood for 45 years before being beaten in 2015 by Brora Rangers. They wore black and red stripes and played their home games at Kingsmills Park. Like many clubs featuring the name &quot;Thistle&quot;, they were often known as &quot;the Jags&quot;.

Thistle applied for membership of the Scottish Football League for the 1973–74 season, but the club lost out to Ferranti Thistle by one vote. It was felt that this was due to clubs in the Central Belt being unwilling to travel to Inverness.

They occasionally qualified for the Scottish Cup. Many regard their most famous result to be the defeat of Kilmarnock by a 3–0 scoreline in season 1984–85.

When two vacancies were recorded in the Scottish League in time for season 1994–95 Thistle decided to again apply for membership. However to improve their chances they decided to merge with city rivals Caledonian who also wanted to apply, as they felt it unlikely both clubs would get both places, and perhaps neither would gain entry if they both applied. This decision was not without controversy. Fans of both clubs bitterly opposed the merger and many tried to stop it. In this they were unsuccessful, and the new entity, Caledonian Thistle (subsequently renamed Inverness Caledonian Thistle) were elected along with Ross County to membership of the Scottish League&#x27;s Third Division for season 1994–95.

The last game of Inverness Thistle Football Club was against Lossiemouth on Saturday, 14 May 1994. The club was 110 years old.

Part of Inverness Thistle lives on at the Harmsworth Park, home of Wick Academy, as the floodlight pylons from Kingsmills Park were relocated there for their admission into the Highland League. However, their status is currently unknown, as they were replaced with higher quality floodlights in 2011 in order for Wick to keep their Licence to host games.

In 2016, the club name was revived at amateur level. Although unrelated, Inverness Thistle AFC were part of the Inverness and District Football Association and played at Bught Park. However, their existence was short-lived, with the club folding in July 2018.

In 2024, Inverness Thistle were revived for a third time, with the club entering discussions with the North Caledonian Football League in hopes of joining for the 2025–26 season.

<doc id="954341" wikidata="Q5270410" url="?curid=954341" title="Diakoptics">
<text>In systems analysis, Diakoptics (Greek &quot;dia&quot;–through + &quot;kopto&quot;–cut, tear) or the &quot;Method of Tearing&quot; involves breaking a (usually physical) problem down into subproblems which can be solved independently before being joined back together to obtain an &quot;exact&quot; solution to the whole problem. The term was introduced by Gabriel Kron in a series &quot;Diakoptics — The Piecewise Solution of Large-Scale Systems&quot; published in London, England by &quot;The Electrical Journal&quot; between June 7, 1957 and February 1959. The twenty-one installments were collected and published as a book of the same title in 1963. The term &quot;diakoptics&quot; was coined by Philip Stanley of the Union College Department of Philosophy.

==Features==
According to Kron, &quot;Diakoptics, or the Method of Tearing, is a combined theory of a pair of storehouses of information, namely equations+graph, or matrices+graph, associated with a given physical or economic system.&quot; What Kron was saying here is that in order to carry out the Method of Tearing, not only were the system equations needed, but also the topology of the system.

Diakoptics was explained in terms of algebraic topology by J. Paul Roth.
Roth describes how Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws in an electrical network with a given impedance matrix or admittance matrix can be solved for currents and voltages by using the circuit topology. Roth translates Kron’s &quot;orthogonality conditions&quot; into exact sequences of homology or cohomology. Roth’s interpretation is confirmed by Raoul Bott in reports in Mathematical Reviews. Roth says, &quot;tearing consists essentially in deducing from the solution of one (easier to solve) network K~ the solution of a network K having the same number of branches as K~ and having the same isomorphism L between the groups of 1-chains and 1-cochains.&quot;
Diakoptics can be seen applied for instance in the text &quot;Solution of Large Networks by Matrix Methods&quot;.

Diakoptics is peculiar as a decomposition method, in that it involves taking values on the &quot;intersection layer&quot; (the boundary between subsystems) into account. The method has been rediscovered by the parallel processing community under the name &quot;Domain Decomposition&quot;.

According to Keith Bowden, &quot;Kron was undoubtedly searching for an ontology of engineering&quot;. Bowden also described &quot;a multilevel hierarchical version of the method, in which the subsystems are recursively torn into subsubsystems&quot;.

When parallel computing was provided by the transputer, Keith Bowden described how diakoptics might be applied. It is an ongoing open question how the parallelism of quantum computing may be relevant.

==Japan==
In 1951, &quot;a group of about twenty scientists and engineers was organized in Japan for the unifying study of basic problems in engineering sciences by means of geometry….reorganized in 1954 into a new organization called the Research Association of Applied Geometry (RAAG).&quot;

&quot;Kron was...the first charter member from overseas. He remained an Honorary Member until he passed away. Meanwhile, the RAAG membership roll has been increased to two hundred and fifty, distributed throughout the world.&quot; Many articles on diakoptics, by Kron and others, were published in the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of RAAG.

The journal &quot;Tensor&quot; (), published in Sapporo, Japan, placed Kron on its &quot;honorary editorial board&quot; in 1951. He contributed an article to the March 1955 issue.

==United Kingdom==
&quot;Kron’s influence extends far beyond the U.S.A. The Tensor Society of Great Britain came into being to further the understanding and applications of tensor analysis.&quot; In 1950 it was founded by S. Austen Stigant as The Tensor Club of Great Britain, and began publishing &quot;Matrix and Tensor Quarterly&quot; (). According to Kron, it was S. Austen Stigant that first suggested Kron write his serial &quot;Diakoptics&quot; for the &quot;Electrical Journal&quot;. In September 1961 the Club became a Society. In 1968 (volume 19) the &quot;Quarterly&quot; published a commemorative issue to note the death of Gabriel Kron. The &quot;Quarterly&quot; continued publishing until 1987.

&quot;C.H. Flurscheim and J.R. Mortlock of Associated Electrical Industries Ltd. [encouraged] the Power Systems Engineering Department of that company to investigate the applications of Diakoptics to the solution of practical load-flow problems and some difficult mechanical vibration problems; investigations which yielded results of considerable value.&quot;

<doc id="954344" wikidata="Q1142929" url="?curid=954344" title="Cube (video game)">
<text>Cube is a free and open-source first-person shooter video game. It is often mistaken with its engine (zlib-licensed), the Cube Engine. The engine and game were developed by Wouter van Oortmerssen. 

It runs on a variety of operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OS X, AmigaOS 4, AROS, iPhone, Wii and Pocket PC devices with 3D acceleration such as Dell Axim x50v. It uses OpenGL and SDL. &quot;Cube&quot; has both single-player and multiplayer gameplay. The game contains a built-in level editor.

The game was originally released in 2001.
The first release with single-player mode was in January 2002. The latest update of &quot;Cube&quot; was released on August 29, 2005.

Its engine has been reused for several other games, of which &quot;AssaultCube&quot;, released in November 2006, is the most popular.

An official successor has been made called &quot;Cube 2: Sauerbraten&quot; (also simply known as &quot;Sauerbraten&quot;). Released in 2004, it uses another engine, the &quot;Cube 2 engine&quot;.

==Gameplay==

As of the August 2005 release, there were 37 single player maps and 65 deathmatch maps, for a total of 102 maps.

Multiplayer uses a networked game code and a thick client/thin server model.

===Single-player===
The single-player gameplay includes two modes. One is a plain single-player mode in which items and monsters do not respawn and have a fixed position; the other is a deathmatch-style mode (where there is a fixed number of monsters, ten per skill level) and items respawn.

===Multiplayer===
Multiplayer gameplay includes twelve modes:

* &quot;Free For All&quot;: Non-teamplay, meant for free-for-all and duel games. This mode is often used for prewar and setting up teams.
* &quot;Coop Edit&quot;: Players can edit maps offline or online with others simultaneously.
* &quot;Teamplay&quot;: Like Free For All, only allied with those whose team variable is the same as the player&#x27;s.
* &quot;Instagib&quot;: All players spawn with full rifle ammo and 1 health. No items are available (non-teamplay and teamplay).
* &quot;Efficiency&quot;: All players have two ammo packs each with 256 health (non-teamplay and teamplay).
* &quot;Insta Arena&quot;: When fragged (killed), players stay dead until there is only one player remaining, and then a new round begins; each player only has the rifle and fist (non-teamplay and teamplay).
* &quot;Tactics Arena&quot;: Like Insta Arena, but each player randomly gets two out of the four possible weapons (with fist), and two ammo packs each (non-teamplay and teamplay).

==Development==
===Game engine===
The &quot;Cube&quot; engine was designed as an outdoor engine, i.e. it&#x27;s designed for maps that are outdoors rather than &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;, which are optimized for indoors. It utilizes a pseudo-3D world model similar to the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, based on a 2D height map. This imposes some limitations (e.g. no rooms above rooms), but does permit slopes and 3D props, which in turn can be used to make up for most limitations, for example, to create bridges with a passage below.

The engine is based on a &quot;zero-precompilation&quot; philosophy – all map data is interpreted dynamically, with no need to recalculate such as shadowmaps or BSP data. This makes realtime in-game map editing feasible. &quot;Cube&quot; supports multi-user, realtime map editing.

The engine is compact and relies on simplicity and brute force instead of fine-tuned complexity.

===Further development===
==== Engine ====
The engine was reused for several other games; the developers usually modified the engine to adapt it to the needs of their projects.

However, there are also changes of unclear nature. The main reason for this is that the engine code is not clearly separated from the game code. Such changes of unclear nature appear both in mods of &quot;Cube&quot; and in other games using the &quot;Cube Engine&quot;.

When the engine is modified, the changes tend to be minor but there also are cases where the changes are significant, such as in &quot;AssaultCube&quot; (released in November 2006) and its fork &quot;AssaultCube Reloaded&quot; (released in December 2010).

===== Ports =====
Intel ported the game to OpenGL ES to demonstrate a new mobile 3D chipset at the Game Developers Conference in 2005.

A &quot;Cube&quot; port, intended as a technology demo was submitted to the iPhone in 2008, and was released to the iPhone App Store on November 18.

A version of &quot;AssaultCube&quot; for Android was released in May 2021.

==== Successors (other engines) ====
===== Cube 2 Engine =====
&quot;Cube 2: Sauerbraten&quot;, released in 2004, is the official successor of Cube. It uses another engine, the &quot;Cube 2 Engine&quot;. While the earliest revisions of the &quot;Cube 2 Engine&quot; were based on code from the &quot;Cube Engine&quot;, with time it became very different. There are many differences between the &quot;Cube Engine&quot; and the &quot;Cube 2 Engine&quot;, including two major ones.

One of these two major differences is the geometry. Unlike the Cube Engine, which has a 2.5D geometry, the Cube 2 Engine has a real 3D geometry.

The other of these two differences is the fact that the source code is foldered. The code of the engine and the game specific code are in two different folders and a third folder contains shared code, allowing communication between the game specific code and the engine. This third folder is named &quot;shared&quot; and the one containing the engine is named &quot;engine&quot;. The name of the folder containing the game specific code is often the name of the game but not always. In the &quot;Cube 2: Sauerbraten&quot; source code, the one of &quot;Sauerbraten&quot; is named &quot;fpsgame&quot; and the one of &quot;Eisenstern&quot; (the RPG embryo that come with most releases of &quot;Cube 2: Sauerbraten&quot;) is named &quot;rpggame&quot;. Alongside these folders, there are other folders, containing libraries used by the engine, the game(s) or both.

This does not prevent engine modifications. &quot;Blood Frontier&quot;, and later &quot;Red Eclipse&quot; (before the version 2.0 of &quot;Red Eclipse&quot;), used modded versions of the Cube 2 Engine. Some of the features of these modified versions, such as the rain particles effect, were later added to the official version of the engine.

===== Tesseract =====
Several forks of the Cube 2 Engine were made but only one of them is its official successor, &quot;Tesseract&quot;. This engine actually shares its name with the game it was made for, unlike its predecessors (the &quot;Cube Engine&quot; was made for &quot;Cube&quot; and the &quot;Cube 2 Engine&quot; was made for &quot;Cube 2: Sauerbraten&quot;).

==== Others ====
&quot;Cube&quot; was used in a computer science course at Brown University in 2006.

==Reception==
&quot;Cube&quot; was reviewed positively by LinuxDevCenter in 2002 and awarded with the &quot;Happypenguin Award&quot; for &quot;Best Free 3D Action Game&quot; by The Linux Game Tome in 2003. In 2005 in an O&#x27;Reilly article on &quot;Open Source Mac Gaming&quot; &quot;Cube&quot; was recommended. MacUpdate rated the game&#x27;s latest release 4.5 stars out of 5. &quot;Cube&quot; was downloaded between 2004 and May 2017 alone from SourceForge.net 2.7 million times.

<doc id="954353" wikidata="Q6501319" url="?curid=954353" title="Proposal (business)">
<text>A business proposal is a written offer from a seller to a prospective sponsor.

Business proposals are often a key step in a complex sales process, where a buyer considers more than price in a purchase. 

A proposal puts the buyer&#x27;s requirements in a context that favors the seller&#x27;s products and services, and educates the buyer about the seller&#x27;s capability to satisfy their needs.

There are three distinct categories of business proposals: formally solicited, informally solicited, unsolicited.

== Solicited proposals ==
Solicited proposals are written in response to published requirements, contained in a request for proposal (RFP), request for quotation (RFQ), invitation for bid (IFB), or a request for information (RFI).

Request for proposal (RFP)

RFPs provide detailed specifications of what the customer wants to buy and sometimes include directions for preparing the proposal, as well as evaluation criteria the customer will use to evaluate offers. Customers issue RFPs when their needs cannot be met with generally available products or services. RFIs are issued to qualify the vendors who are interested in providing service/products for specific requirements. Based on the response to RFI, detailed RFP is issued to qualified vendors who the organization believes can provide desired services. Proposals in response to RFPs are seldom less than 10 pages and sometimes reach thousands of pages, without cost data.
Request for quotation (RFQ)

Customers issue RFQs when they want to buy large amounts of a commodity and price is not the only issue—for example, when availability or delivering or service are considerations. RFQs can be very detailed, so proposals written to RFQs can be lengthy but are generally much shorter than an RFP-proposal. RFQ proposals consist primarily of cost data, with brief narratives addressing customer issues, such as quality control.
Invitation for bid (IFB)

Customers issue IFBs when they are buying some service, such as construction. The requirements are detailed, but the primary consideration is price. For example, a customer provides architectural blueprints for contractors to bid on. These proposals can be lengthy but most of the length comes from cost-estimating data and detailed schedules.

Request for information (RFI)

Sometimes before a customer issues an RFP or RFQ or IFB, the customer will issue a Request for Information (RFI). The purpose of the RFI is to gain &quot;marketing intelligence&quot; about what products, services, and vendors are available. RFIs are used to shape final RFPs, RFQs, and IFBs, so potential vendors take great care in responding to these requests, hoping to shape the eventual formal solicitation toward their products or services.

== Informally solicited proposal ==
These types of proposals are made when a private firm, government agency, or association negotiates to supply a service or product to a single company and when a company has excellent credibility and a track record of achievements. The standard format for this type of proposal consists of information about a specific product, including the price and delivery schedules. Some advantages to this include not having to have resources to win a contract and the firm or client knows what time the work will be coming.

Internal proposals

Internal proposals are ideas or projects that are presented to whoever holds the position of top management in a company. These types of proposals can be written by a particular individual, group, department, or division of a particular company. One example of this is when the manager of a product line writes a proposal suggesting that the company should robotize the production process. Some advantages to this includes easier communication, knowing the client&#x27;s needs and making fast decisions. Some advantages to this may include competition from other companies and the loss of management champions.

== Unsolicited proposal ==
Unsolicited proposals are generic marketing brochures used to introduce a product or service to a prospective customer. They are often used as &quot;leave-behinds&quot; at the end of initial meetings with or customers or &quot;give-aways&quot; at trade shows or other public meetings. They are not designed to close a sale, just introduce the possibility of a sale.

==Components==

===Formally solicited proposals===
# Requirements Matrix, which matches customer requirements with the paragraph and page numbers of where those requirements are addressed in the proposal
# Executive Summary, which outlines the primary benefits of the vendor&#x27;s solutions to the customer&#x27;s requirements
# Technical Volume, which demonstrates how each requirement will be met
# Management Volume, which describes how the program will be managed
# Cost Volume, which provides all costing data, as well as implementation plans and schedules

=== Informally solicited business proposal ===
# A description of the seller&#x27;s capabilities or products
# A discussion of key issues
# A description of the buyer&#x27;s specifications and how they will be met
# The cost of the offering
# A schedule for delivery of the products or services
# Proof of prior experience i.e. Testimonials from previous customers, Descriptions of previous projects

==Managing business proposals==
Proposal management often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities:
* Creator – responsible for creating and editing content.
* Editor – responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.
* Publisher – responsible for releasing the content for use.
* Administrator – responsible for managing access permissions to documents and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles.
* Consumer or viewer – the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.

Some writers refer to key stages in the proposal management process using colour codes to denote milestone reviews, for example a black hat review. The Association of Proposal Management Professionals (APMP) refers to a black hat review as an independent review of the strategies and proposals likely to be put forward by competitors. Other colours are used in relation to teams: a pre-writing strategy review is sometimes called a &quot;Pink Team&quot;, a formal draft review may be called a &quot;Red Team&quot;, and the term &quot;Gold Team&quot; indicates a final pre-submission review.

Inherent to the process of managing proposal is the decision of whether to submit a bid, which is underpinned by the capture plan.

<doc id="954359" wikidata="Q326998" url="?curid=954359" title="Hoary marmot">
<text>The hoary marmot (Marmota caligata) is a species of marmot that inhabits the mountains of northwest North America. Hoary marmots live near the tree line on slopes with grasses and forbs to eat and rocky areas for cover.

It is the largest North American ground squirrel and is often nicknamed &quot;the whistler&quot; for its high-pitched warning issued to alert other members of the colony to possible danger. The animals are sometimes called &quot;whistle pigs&quot;. Whistler, British Columbia, originally &quot;London Mountain&quot; because of its heavy fogs and rain, was renamed after these animals to help make it more marketable as a resort. The closest relatives of the species are the yellow-bellied, Olympic, and Vancouver Island marmots, although the exact relationships are unclear.

==Description==

The hoary marmot is a large, bulky, ground squirrel, with short, heavy limbs, and a broad head. Adults range from in total length, including a tail. The species is sexually dimorphic, with males being significantly larger than females in most subspecies. Because of their long winter hibernation, during which they survive on fat reserves, the weight of the animals varies considerably over the course of the year, from an average of in May to around in September, for a fully grown adult. A few fall adult males can commonly range up to a weight of . The record sized autumn male specimen attained a mass of nearly , possibly the largest size known for any marmot. Going on its average size relative to other marmot species, it is slightly smaller on average than the Olympic marmot, similar in size to the Vancouver Island marmot and broadly overlaps in size with several lesser-known Asian marmot species as well.

The word &quot;hoary&quot; refers to the silver-gray fur on their shoulders and upper back; the remainder of the upper parts have drab- or reddish-brown fur. The head is black on the upper surface, with a white patch on the muzzle, white fur on the chin and around the lips, and grizzled black or brown fur elsewhere. The feet and lower legs are black, sometimes with white patches on the fore feet. Marmots have long guard hairs that provide most of the visible colour of their pelage, and a dense, soft underfur that provides insulation. The greyish underparts of the body lack this underfur, and are more sparsely haired than the rest of the body. Hoary marmots moult in the early to mid summer.

The feet have slightly curved claws, which are somewhat larger on the fore feet than on the hind feet. The feet have hairless pads, enhancing their grip. The tail is long, slightly flattened, and covered with dense fur. Apart from the larger size of the males, both sexes have a similar appearance. Females have five pairs of teats, running from the pectoral to the inguinal regions.

==Distribution and habitat==
The hoary marmot predominantly inhabits mountainous alpine environments to elevation, although coastal population also occur at or near sea level in British Columbia and Alaska. Hoary marmots occur from southern Washington and central Idaho north, and are found through much of Alaska south of the Yukon River. They live above the tree line, at elevations from sea level to , depending on latitude, in rocky terrain or alpine meadows dominated by grasses, sedges, herbs, and Krummholz forest patches. Range maps often erroneously depict hoary marmots occurring north of the Yukon River in Alaska, this region is occupied by the Alaska marmot (&quot;M. broweri&quot;) and not the hoary marmot. Hoary marmots also occur on several islands in Alaska and fossils dating back to the Pleistocene, including some from islands no longer inhabited by the species.

The three currently recognized subspecies are:

* &quot;Marmota caligata caligata&quot; – Alaska, Yukon, NW Territories, northern British Columbia
* &quot;Marmota caligata cascandensis&quot; – Cascade Mountains, from British Columbia to Washington
* &quot;Marmota caligata okanagana&quot; – Rocky Mountains, from Yukon to Montana and Idaho

==Behaviour and diet==
Hoary marmots are diurnal and herbivorous, subsisting on leaves, flowers, grasses, and sedges. Predators include golden eagles, grizzly and black bears, wolverines, coyotes, red foxes, lynxes, wolves, and cougars. They live in colonies of up to 36 individuals, with a home range averaging about . Each colony includes a single, dominant, adult male, up to three adult females, sometimes with a subordinate adult male, and a number of young and subadults up to two years of age.

The marmots hibernate seven to eight months a year in burrows they excavate in the soil, often among or under boulders. Each colony typically maintains a single hibernaculum and a number of smaller burrows, used for sleeping and refuge from predators. The refuge burrows are the simplest and most numerous type, consisting of a single bolt hole deep. Each colony digs an average of five such burrows a year, and a mature colony may have over a hundred. Sleeping burrows and hibernacula are larger and more complex, with multiple entrances, deep chambers lined with plant material, and stretching to a depth of about . A colony may have up to 9 regular sleeping burrows, in addition to the larger hibernaculum.
Many forms of social behaviour have been observed among hoary marmots, including play fighting, wrestling, social grooming, and nose-to-nose touching. Such activity becomes particularly frequent as hibernation approaches. Interactions with individuals from other colonies are less common, and usually hostile, with females chasing away intruders. Hoary marmots are also vocal animals, with at least seven distinct types of calls, including chirps, whistles, growls, and whining sounds. Many of these calls are used as alarms, alerting other animals to potential predators. They also communicate using scent, both by defecation, and by marking rocks or plants using scent glands on their cheeks.

Hoary marmots frequently sun themselves on rocks, spending as much as 44% of their time in the morning doing so, although they will shelter in their burrows or otherwise seek shade in especially warm weather. They forage for the rest of the day, returning to their burrows to sleep during the night.

In areas frequented by people, hoary marmots are not shy. Rather than running away at first sight, they will often go about their business while being watched.

Mating occurs after hibernation, and two to four young are born in the spring. Males establish &quot;harems&quot;, but may also visit females in other territories.

==Reproduction==
Hoary marmots breed shortly after, or even before, their emergence from hibernation burrows in May and in some areas (such as the eastern Cascade foothills of Washington State) as early as February. Courtship consists of sniffing the genital region, followed by mounting, although mounting has also been observed between females. Females typically raise litters only in alternate years, although both greater and lesser frequencies have been reported on occasion.

Gestation lasts 25 to 30 days, so the litter of two to five young is born between late May and mid-June. The young emerge from their birth den at three to four weeks of age, by which time they have a full coat of fur and are already beginning to be weaned. The young are initially cautious, but begin to exhibit the full range of nonreproductive adult behavior within about four weeks of emerging from the burrow. Subadults initially remain with their birth colony, but typically leave at two years of age, becoming fully sexually mature the following year.

<doc id="954364" wikidata="Q242730" url="?curid=954364" title="Mount Asama">
<text>is an active complex volcano in central Honshū, the main island of Japan. The volcano is the most active on Honshū. The Japan Meteorological Agency classifies Mount Asama as rank A. It stands above sea level on the border of Gunma and Nagano prefectures. It is included in &quot;100 Famous Japanese Mountains&quot;.

==Geology==
Mount Asama sits at the conjunction of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc and the Northeastern Japan Arc. The mountain is built up from non-alkali mafic and pyroclastic volcanic rocks dating from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. The main rock types are andesite and dacite.

Scientists from the University of Tokyo and Nagoya University completed their first successful imaging experiment of the interior of the volcano in April 2007. By detecting sub-atomic particles called muons as they passed through the volcano after arriving from space, the scientists were able gradually to build up a picture of the interior, creating images of cavities through which lava was passing deep inside the volcano.

A University of Tokyo volcano observatory is located on the mountain&#x27;s east slope. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.

There is also another mountain called Asama (朝熊山, &quot;Asama-yama&quot;) of only 555 meters in Mie Prefecture.

==Eruptive history==

The geologic features of this active volcano are closely monitored with seismographs and strategically positioned video cameras. Scientists have noted a range of textural variety in the ash which has been deposited in the region during the serial eruptions since the &quot;Tennin&quot; eruption of 1108.

===&quot;Tennin&quot; eruption (1108)===
The eruption of Mount Asama in 1108 (&quot;Tennin 1&quot;) has been the subject of studies by modern science. Records suggest that the magnitude of this plinian eruption was twice as large as that of the &quot;Tenmei&quot; catastrophe in 1783.

A Swiss research team found Mount Asama&#x27;s volcanic eruption could have contributed to extreme weather that caused severe famine, torrential rain and consecutive cold summers in Europe. They studied ice cores in Greenland which had increased sulfate deposition in 1108 CE. In the late Heian Period (794–1185) the diary of the court noble Fujiwara no Munetada reported that Mount Asama erupted on 29 August 1108. He wrote that a local report described rice paddies and fields could not be farmed due to being covered by a thick layer of ash.

===&quot;Tenmei&quot; eruption (1783)===
Mount Asama erupted in 1783 (&quot;Tenmei 3&quot;), causing widespread damage. The three-month-long plinian eruption that began on 9 May 1783, produced andesitic pumice falls, pyroclastic flows, lava flows, and enlarged the cone. The climactic eruption began on 4 August and lasted for 15 hours, and contained pumice falls and pyroclastic flows. The complex features of this eruption are explained by rapid deposits of coarse pyroclastic ash near the vent and the subsequent flows of lava; and these events which were accompanied by a high eruption plume which generated further injections of pumice into the air.

===1982 eruption===
Explosive eruptions occurred at the summit of Asama volcano on 26 April. Fine ash fell in Tokyo, to the SE, for the first time in 23 years.

Three small ash eruptions occurred at Asama volcano in August 2008. This was the first activity at the volcano since 2004.

===2009 eruptions===
Mount Asama erupted in early February 2009, sending ash to a height of , and throwing rocks up to from the crater. Ash fall was reported in Tokyo, southeast of the volcano crater. On 16 February there were 13 recorded volcanic earthquakes and an eruption emitting smoke and ash in a cloud high.

Mount Asama continued to have small eruptions, tremors and earthquakes in February and remained on level-3 alert, with a danger zone within of the crater.

===2019 eruption===
A small eruption occurred on August 7th, 2019, with smoke reaching about 1,800 meters above the mountain.

== Onioshidashi ==

Onioshidashi () &quot;expelling demons&quot; is the name of a lava flow on the northern slope of Mount Asama. The lava flow that erupted in 1783 Tenmei eruption was solidified. Now, it is known as a tourist destination.

== Asama Volcano Museum ==

The Asama Volcano Museum (), from the crater of the Mount Asama, open from 1993 to 2020, explained volcanoes.

The museum was in Naganohara-machi, Agatsuma-gun, Gunma Prefecture. As of early 2009, it was open from April until November.

Visitor numbers peaked at 265,000 in 1994; however, seismic activity at nearby Mount Asama was one reason for frequent closures. The closures were a factor in the drop in visitors: this gradually fell to 23,000. In the later years of the museum, most of the visitors were on school excursions. The museum was running a deficit of about 17 million yen per year, paid for by the town of Naganohara. Additionally, the building was ageing, and maintenance threatened to cost hundreds of millions of yen.

A nearby building, Asama memorial hall () exhibited motorbikes; the plan in summer 2020 was to move these to a municipally owned tourist facility, Asama pasture (), and to move some of the exhibits of the volcano museum to the memorial hall.

== Gallery ==
==In popular culture==
Mount Asama served as the backdrop to Japan&#x27;s first colour film, &quot;Carmen Comes Home&quot;. Several references are made to Mount Asama throughout the film, including a melody composed by a blind composer, Mr. Taguchi.

In the anime &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, the Eighth Angel, Sandalphon, was located inside Mount Asama.

<doc id="954381" wikidata="Q7566103" url="?curid=954381" title="South Australian Certificate of Education">
<text>The South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) is awarded to students who have successfully completed their senior secondary schooling in the state of South Australia.

The SACE Board of South Australia (formerly known as the Senior Secondary Assessment Board of South Australia, or SSABSA) administrates the certificate. The SACE Board of South Australia is an independent statutory authority of the South Australian Government accredited under ISO 9001:2008.

The SACE curriculum is also taught in Northern Territory secondary schools, where it is known as the Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET). The South Australian Matriculation (SAM) certificate is a qualification based on the SACE curriculum which is administered by the SACE Board of South Australia and taught in some schools in Malaysia and China.

To receive the SACE, students must gain 200 credits from a range of subjects, usually over two years. Twenty credits is equal to a full year subject, while 10 credits is equal to a semester long subject. There are two stages: Stage 1, which most students do in Year 11, and Stage 2, which most students do in Year 12.

Students may attain a partial SACE certification by gaining the minimum number of credits, yet bypassing the ATAR system. This approach does not guarantee an entry to university, however, a student may gain admittance via alternative pathways such as first attending TAFE then transferring to university, or by sitting an entry exam.

==Importance==
Completion of the SACE is a general requirement to get into universities and colleges of technical and further education (TAFE colleges) in South Australia, nationally and internationally. The certificate also provides many study options for students who want to follow a different pathway into the workforce, such as undertaking apprenticeships while still at school. The SACE&#x27;s Research Project has been suggested to be non compulsory in 2012 by Australian Education Union SA branch president Correna Haythorpe.

== How the SACE works ==

There are two stages of the SACE:
* Stage 1, which most students do in Year 11, apart from the Personal Learning Plan subject (now gradually being replaced by Exploring Identities and Futures; a culmination of work to revitalise the Personal Learning Plan), which most students do in Year 10
* Stage 2, which most students do in Year 12.

Each subject or course successfully completed earns ‘credits’ towards the SACE, with a minimum of 200 credits required for students to gain the certificate.

Students will receive a final grade from A to E for each Stage 1 subject and A+ to E− for Stage 2 subjects. For compulsory requirements, to gain their SACE they will need to achieve:
* a C grade or better at Stage 1
* a C− grade or better at Stage 2.

The compulsory requirements are:
* Personal Learning Plan (or as of recently, Exploring Identities and Futures) (10 credits at Stage 1)
* Literacy – at least 20 credits from a range of English subjects or courses (Stage 1 or Stage 2)
* Numeracy – at least 10 credits from a range of mathematics subjects or courses (Stage 1 or Stage 2)
* Research Project (or as of recently, Activating Identities and Futures) – an in-depth major project (10 credits at Stage 2)
* Other Stage 2 subjects totalling at least 60 credits.

The remaining 90 credits can be gained through additional Stage 1 or Stage 2 subjects or Board-recognised courses (such as VET or community learning) of a student’s choice.

===Assessment===
SACE studies are assessed both internally (in school) and externally. All top-tier stage 2 subjects have a 30% external assessment, which may be an exam, investigation or performance. As well as the compulsory subjects, stage 2 school based assessments are centrally moderated to ensure fair and accurate results.

==SACE and tertiary studies==

SACE results are scaled and then used to calculate a University Aggregate, which is out of 90. This is then converted into an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR), previously a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) which universities within Australia use to select students who will be offered places in particular courses. A TAFE SA selection score is also calculated for entry into other further education courses. 
Full details of South Australian university and TAFE entry requirements for 2012 onwards are provided in ‘Australian Tertiary Admissions Booklet 2013, 2014, 2015’, published by the South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre, the South Australian Government authority which processes applications for tertiary courses in South Australia and the Northern Territory.

==Awards==

SACE results are announced in December each year. Governor of South Australia Commendations are awarded to people who receive merits in 90 Stage 2 credits (including Research Project) or achieved an A in 70 or more credits and displayed &quot;Excellence in the development of one or more SACE capabilities&quot;. Merits are awarded to students who receive an A+, and have displayed &quot;exceptional achievement&quot; (less than 2% of students taking a subject) in individual subjects in their Stage 2 SACE results. Prizes are awarded to the top student in certain subjects, including:
* Music (Don Maynard Music Prize)
* Physics (The Bronze Bragg Medal)
* Chemistry (The Way College Prize)
* Biology (The Hardwicke College Prize) and
* English Studies (The Tennyson Medal)

==Current usage==

A number of countries utilize SACE (known as SACE International outside of Australia) as one of the pre-university qualifications.

===Malaysia===
SACE International offered in Malaysia is effectively an almost similar programme as Australian Matriculation (AUSMAT). The difference being their examination board and course structure. AUSMAT is administered by Western Australian Certificate of Education Board while SACE International is administered by South Australian Certificate of Education Board. As for the course structure, AUSMAT consists of 50% coursework and 50% examination, while SACE International consists of 70% coursework and 30% examination.

Some of the private universities offering AUSMAT / SACE International in Malaysia include:
* INTEC Education College
* INTI International University
* Taylor&#x27;s College
* DISTED College

<text>New Zealand Sign Language or NZSL () is the main language of the deaf community in New Zealand. It became an official language of New Zealand in April 2006 under the New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006. The purpose of the act was to create rights and obligations in the use of NZSL throughout the legal system and to ensure that the Deaf community had the same access to government information and services as everybody else. According to the 2013 Census, over 20,000 New Zealanders know NZSL.

New Zealand Sign Language has its roots in British Sign Language (BSL), and may be technically considered a dialect of British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language (BANZSL). There are 62.5% similarities found in British Sign Language and NZSL, compared with 33% of NZSL signs found in American Sign Language.

Like other natural sign languages, it was devised by and for deaf people, with no linguistic connection to a spoken or written language.

NZSL uses the same two-handed manual alphabet as BSL (British Sign Language) and Auslan (Australian Sign Language).

It uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than BSL, reflecting New Zealand&#x27;s history of oralist education of deaf people. Its vocabulary includes Māori concepts such as marae and tangi, and signs for New Zealand placenames (e.g., Rotorua – mudpools, and Christchurch – 2 Cs, represents ChCh.)

==History==

The early British immigrants to New Zealand who were deaf brought British Sign Language with them. The first known teacher of sign language was Dorcas Mitchell, who taught the children of one family in Charteris Bay, Lyttelton Harbour, from 1868 to 1877. By 1877 she had taught 42 pupils.

When the first school for the deaf (then called the Sumner Deaf and Dumb Institution) was opened at Sumner, south east of Christchurch in 1878, Mitchell applied unsuccessfully for the position of principal. Instead it went to Gerrit Van Asch, who agreed with the Milan congress of deaf educators of 1880 (to which no deaf people were invited) that teaching should be oral only, and that sign language should be forbidden. (He would not even admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was the policy of the school until 1979. A documentary film about the school made in the 1950s makes no mention of sign language. Similar policies were maintained at the schools at Titirangi and Kelston that opened in 1940 and 1958.

Unsurprisingly, the children used sign language secretly and after leaving school, developing NZSL out of British Sign Language largely without adult intervention for over 100 years. The main haven for NZSL was the Deaf Clubs in the main centres. In 1979, &quot;Total Communication&quot; (a &quot;use anything that works&quot; philosophy) was adopted at the Sumner School, but the signing it used was &quot;Australasian Sign Language&quot; an artificial signed form of English. As a result, younger signers use a number of Australasian signs in their NZSL, to such an extent that some call traditional NZSL &quot;Old Sign&quot;. NZSL was adopted for teaching in 1994.

In 1985, Marianne Ahlgren proved in her PhD thesis at Victoria University of Wellington that NZSL is a fully-fledged
language, with a large vocabulary of signs and a consistent grammar of space.

The New Zealand Sign Language Teachers Association (NZSLTA – formerly known as the New Zealand Sign Language Tutors Association) was set up in 1992. Over the next few years adult education classes in NZSL began in several centres. In 1997 a Certificate in Deaf Studies programme was started at Victoria University of Wellington, with instruction actually in NZSL, designed to teach deaf people how to competently teach NZSL to the wider public. Also in 1992 an interpreter training programme was established at the Auckland Institute of Technology, now known as Auckland University of Technology. This programme was first directed and taught by Dr Rachel Locker McKee (hearing) and Dr David McKee (deaf) and came about due to lobbying by the New Zealand Deaf Community and others who recognised the need for safer and more professional interpreting services. They had as early as 1984 sought support for more research to determine the need for sign language interpreters. Other than a one-off course run in 1985, this was the first time a professional training programme with a qualification was offered in New Zealand. Many of those who have gone on to work as professional NZSL interpreters began their journey in NZSL community classes taught by members of the NZSLTA.

An important step toward the recognition of NZSL was the publication in 1998 of a comprehensive NZSL dictionary by Victoria University of Wellington and the Deaf Association of NZ. It contains some 4000 signs (which correspond to many more meanings than the same number of English words, because of the way signs can be modulated in space and time), sorted by handshape, not English meaning, and coded in the Hamburg Notational System, HamNoSys, as well as pictorially. In 2011, Victoria University launched an Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language based on the original 1998 work, which includes video clips of each sign with examples and the ability to search for signs based on features of the sign (handshape, location, etc.) as well as the sign&#x27;s English gloss.

For some years, TVNZ broadcast a weekly news programme, &quot;News Review&quot;, interpreted in NZSL. This was discontinued in 1993 after a joint survey of deaf and hearing-impaired people found a majority favoured captioned programmes. Many Deaf people felt they had been misled by the survey. There has been no regular programming in NZSL since.

Between August 2012 to August 2013 the Human Rights Commission carried out an inquiry into the use and promotion of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The inquiry has focused on working with key government agencies and the Deaf community around the inquiry&#x27;s three terms of reference 1) The right to education for deaf people and potential users of NZSL. 2) The rights of deaf people, and other potential users of NZSL, to access communication, information and services, and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, through the provision of professional NZSL interpreter services and other NZSL services and resources. 3) The promotion and maintenance of NZSL as an official language of New Zealand. The full report of the inquiry, &quot;A New Era in the Right to Sign&quot;, was launched in Parliament by the Minister for Disability Issues, Tariana Turia, on 3 September 2013.

==Official language status==
NZSL became the third official language of New Zealand on 11 April 2006, joining English and Māori. The parliamentary bill to approve this passed its third reading on 6 April 2006. At the first reading in Parliament, on 22 June 2004, the bill was supported by all political parties. It was referred to the Justice and Electoral Committee, which reported back to the House on 18 July 2005. The second reading passed by 119 to 2 on 23 February 2006 with only the ACT party opposing, because the government was not providing funding for NZSL. It passed the third reading on 6 April 2006 by the same margin. The bill received Royal assent on 10 April 2006 and became law the following day.

The use of NZSL as a valid medium of instruction has not always been accepted by the government, the Association of Teachers of the Deaf, nor by many parents. However, in light of much research into its validity as a language and much advocacy by deaf adults, parents of deaf children (both hearing and deaf) and educationalists, NZSL has since become — in tandem with English — part of the bilingual/bicultural approach used in public schools (including Kelston Deaf Education Centre and Van Asch Deaf Education Centre) since 1994. Victoria University of Wellington has courses in New Zealand Sign Language, although it has yet to develop a major programme for it. Auckland University of Technology (AUT) offers a 3-year Bachelor of Arts course with an NZSL-English Interpreting major.

==Variants==
Differences in lexicon in New Zealand Sign Language have largely developed through the student communities surrounding five schools for the deaf in New Zealand:
*Van Asch Deaf Education Centre (formerly Sumner School for the Deaf), opened 1880 (Christchurch) 
*St Dominic&#x27;s School for the Deaf, opened 1944 in Wellington, moved to Feilding in 1953
*Titirangi School for the Deaf, opened 1942 and closed in the end of 1959 (when the classes opened at Kelston, Titirangi became a boarding house)
* Mt Wellington School for the Deaf opened (due to overflow at Titirangi) 1952 and closed in the end of 1959 – when the classes opened at Kelston, Mt Wellington became a boarding house.
*Kelston School for the Deaf, opened 1958 (Auckland) and Kelston School for the Deaf Children was renamed in 1991 to Kelston Deaf Education Centre.
