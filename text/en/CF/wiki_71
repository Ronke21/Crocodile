<text>Harry James Sinden (born September 14, 1932) is a Canadian former ice hockey player, coach, and executive. He served as a coach, general manager, and team president for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL), and was the coach of Team Canada during the 1972 Summit Series. He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in the builders category. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in its inaugural class of 1997.

==Playing career==
Sinden played defence for the Toronto Marlboros bantams before moving up to the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey Association for junior hockey. He played in Oshawa from 1949 to 1953, and then for six seasons in the OHA senior division with the Whitby Dunlops. He was team captain when the Dunlops won the Allan Cup in 1957, and then the 1958 World Hockey Championship for Canada in Oslo, Norway. He also won a silver medal as a member of the Canadian national men&#x27;s hockey team at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California. The core of the team was the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, with Sinden one of four players from the Dunlops added to the lineup to strengthen the team for the Olympics.

Near the end of the season, the Montreal Canadiens placed Sinden on their negotiation list but didn&#x27;t reach an agreement with him. After playing some games with the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens in the Eastern Professional Hockey League he met Lynn Patrick, general manager of the Boston Bruins, who signed him as a player – assistant coach for the Kingston Frontenacs, the Bruins&#x27; EPHL affiliate, starting in 1960–61. He was named a first-team all-star for the 1961–62 season and league MVP for 1962–63. After the league folded, the team became the Minneapolis Bruins of the Central Hockey League for the 1963–64 season with Sinden as player-coach. After two seasons the team moved again, becoming the Oklahoma City Blazers, where Sinden finished his playing career in 1965–66 after six seasons with the franchise. In that final season, he coached the team to the league championship.

==Coaching in the NHL==
In May 1966, Sinden moved up to the NHL as head coach of the Boston Bruins. At 33 he was the youngest coach in the league at the time, coaching the youngest team. In his first season — with a team that included rookie Bobby Orr—the Bruins finished out of the playoffs with the worst record in the league. But in his second year, aided by the acquisitions of Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield in a blockbuster deal with the Chicago Black Hawks, the team posted a winning record. In his third season, the Bruins finished with 100 points just behind the Montreal Canadiens for the top spot in the NHL. In his fourth season, 1969–70, he coached the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup in 29 years.

==Retirement and Summit Series==
Despite his success with the team, Sinden had a rocky relationship with Bruins management during the championship season, which led to the 37-year-old Sinden announcing his retirement just days after winning the Cup. The club placed him on its voluntary retired list, preventing him from taking a job with another team for one year. He then accepted a job with the Stirling Homex Corporation, a home construction company in Rochester, New York. In October 1970, he published a story in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; declaring he had left the Bruins because of their mid-season refusal to give him a raise for the following year.

Sinden was offered the job as the first head coach of the New York Islanders at the beginning of 1972 but turned it down. He also rejected offers from the Toronto Maple Leafs and the St. Louis Blues. In June 1972, after two years away from hockey, he was named head coach and manager of the Canadian team for the eight-game Summit Series. After a slow start, he led the Canadians to a come-from-behind win capped by Paul Henderson&#x27;s series-winning goal with 34 seconds remaining in the final game. Esposito, reunited with Sinden, was the leading scorer in the series.

Sinden maintained a tape-recorded diary throughout the series which was turned into a book, &quot;Hockey Showdown&quot;, published in 1972.

==Returns to the Bruins==

Within days after the Summit Series, he signed a five-year deal to return to the Bruins as their general manager, succeeding Milt Schmidt, who was named to the post of executive director. He went on to spend just over 28 years as general manager of the Bruins before he stepped down on October 25, 2000, in favour of his assistant GM, Mike O&#x27;Connell. His 28-year tenure almost equalled the 30-year reign (1924–54) of Art Ross, the team&#x27;s founding manager. Sinden, who had added the title of club president in December 1988, remained as the chief executive of the Bruins until the summer of 2006 when he retired to a consulting role.

As GM, Sinden presided over the team&#x27;s long years of consistent success, setting the North American major professional record for most consecutive seasons in the playoffs with 29, which included making the finals five times (1974, 1977, 1978, 1988, 1990 — losing the finals each time) and two regular-season first-place finishes (1983, 1990).

Notwithstanding this longstanding success, he was the subject of controversies ranging from video replays to salary arbitration and was under frequent fire from Bruin fans. In the 1996–97 season, the NHL fined him $5,000 USD for verbal abuse of a video-replay official who had disallowed a goal in the second period of a game between the Bruins and the Ottawa Senators. He also refused to honor a salary-arbitration award and let Dmitri Khristich, a 29-goal scorer, leave the team without compensation. He had been highly critical of Khristich&#x27;s performance in the playoffs and was angered when an arbitrator awarded him a salary of $2.8 million.

Sinden is currently the Bruins&#x27; &quot;Senior Advisor to the Owner&quot;, as well as a former member of the selection committee for the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is also a &quot;Hockey GM &amp; Scouting&quot; instructor for the online sports-career training school Sports Management Worldwide, founded and run by Dr. Lynn Lashbrook. In 2011, his name was inscribed on the Stanley Cup for a second time, 41 years after his first Stanley Cup title as a coach.

==Career coaching record==
==Personal life==
Sinden and his wife, Eleanor, have four daughters and reside in Winchester, Massachusetts. He was the godfather of Canadian rock musician Gord Downie, the late lead singer of The Tragically Hip.

==Popular culture==
Sinden was played by Booth Savage in &quot;Canada Russia &#x27;72&quot;, a television miniseries based on the 1972 Summit Series.
Sinden was played by Ian Tracy in &quot;Keep Your Head Up, Kid: The Don Cherry Story&quot;, a television special by CBC based on the life of coach and sports commentator Don Cherry.

<doc id="963042" wikidata="Q21083858" url="?curid=963042" title="Finitely generated group">
<text>In algebra, a finitely generated group is a group &quot;G&quot; that has some finite generating set &quot;S&quot; so that every element of &quot;G&quot; can be written as the combination (under the group operation) of finitely many elements of &quot;S&quot; and of inverses of such elements. 

By definition, every finite group is finitely generated, since &quot;S&quot; can be taken to be &quot;G&quot; itself. Every infinite finitely generated group must be countable but countable groups need not be finitely generated. The additive group of rational numbers Q is an example of a countable group that is not finitely generated.

== Examples ==
* Every quotient of a finitely generated group &quot;G&quot; is finitely generated; the quotient group is generated by the images of the generators of &quot;G&quot; under the canonical projection.
* A group that is generated by a single element is called cyclic. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers Z.
** A locally cyclic group is a group in which every finitely generated subgroup is cyclic.
* The free group on a finite set is finitely generated by the elements of that set (§Examples).
* A fortiori, every finitely presented group (§Examples) is finitely generated.

==Finitely generated abelian groups==

Every abelian group can be seen as a module over the ring of integers Z, and in a finitely generated abelian group with generators &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, every group element &quot;x&quot; can be written as a linear combination of these generators,
:&quot;x&quot; = &quot;α&quot;1⋅&quot;x&quot;1 + &quot;α&quot;2⋅&quot;x&quot;2 + ... + &quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot;⋅&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;
with integers &quot;α&quot;1, ..., &quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

Subgroups of a finitely generated abelian group are themselves finitely generated.

The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups states that a finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum of a free abelian group of finite rank and a finite abelian group, each of which are unique up to isomorphism.

==Subgroups==
A subgroup of a finitely generated group need not be finitely generated. The commutator subgroup of the free group formula_1 on two generators is an example of a subgroup of a finitely generated group that is not finitely generated.

On the other hand, all subgroups of a finitely generated abelian group are finitely generated.

A subgroup of finite index in a finitely generated group is always finitely generated, and the Schreier index formula gives a bound on the number of generators required.

In 1954, Albert G. Howson showed that the intersection of two finitely generated subgroups of a free group is again finitely generated. Furthermore, if formula_2 and formula_3 are the numbers of generators of the two finitely generated subgroups then their intersection is generated by at most formula_4 generators. This upper bound was then significantly improved by Hanna Neumann to formula_5; see Hanna Neumann conjecture.

The lattice of subgroups of a group satisfies the ascending chain condition if and only if all subgroups of the group are finitely generated. A group such that all its subgroups are finitely generated is called Noetherian.

A group such that every finitely generated subgroup is finite is called locally finite. Every locally finite group is periodic, i.e., every element has finite order. Conversely, every periodic abelian group is locally finite.

== Applications ==

Finitely generated groups arise in diverse mathematical and scientific contexts. A frequent way they do so is by the Švarc-Milnor lemma, or more generally thanks to an action through which a group inherits some finiteness property of a space. Geometric group theory studies the connections between algebraic properties of finitely generated groups and topological and geometric properties of spaces on which these groups act.

=== Differential geometry and topology ===

* Fundamental groups of compact manifolds are finitely generated. Their geometry coarsely reflects the possible geometries of the manifold: for instance, non-positively curved compact manifolds have CAT(0) fundamental groups, whereas uniformly positively-curved manifolds have finite fundamental group (see Myers&#x27; theorem).
* Mostow&#x27;s rigidity theorem: for compact hyperbolic manifolds of dimension at least 3, an isomorphism between their fundamental groups extends to a Riemannian isometry.
* Mapping class groups of surfaces are also important finitely generated groups in low-dimensional topology.

=== Algebraic geometry and number theory ===

* Lattices in Lie groups, in p-adic groups...
* Superrigidity, Margulis&#x27; arithmeticity theorem

=== Combinatorics, algorithmics and cryptography ===

* Infinite families of expander graphs can be constructed thanks to finitely generated groups with property T
* Algorithmic problems in combinatorial group theory
* Group-based cryptography attempts to make use of hard algorithmic problems related to group presentations in order to construct quantum-resilient cryptographic protocols

=== Analysis ===

=== Probability theory ===

* Random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups provide approachable examples of random walks on graphs
* Percolation on Cayley graphs

=== Physics and chemistry ===

* Crystallographic groups
* Mapping class groups appear in topological quantum field theories

=== Biology ===

* Knot groups are used to study molecular knots

==Related notions==
The word problem for a finitely generated group is the decision problem of whether two words in the generators of the group represent the same element. The word problem for a given finitely generated group is solvable if and only if the group can be embedded in every algebraically closed group.

The rank of a group is often defined to be the smallest cardinality of a generating set for the group. By definition, the rank of a finitely generated group is finite.

<text>Jon Kelly Kitna (born September 21, 1972) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Seattle Seahawks, Cincinnati Bengals, Detroit Lions, and Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the Central Washington Wildcats and was signed by the Seahawks as an undrafted free agent in 1996. He is currently the head football coach at Lakota East High School in Ohio.

==Early life==
Kitna was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington. He attended Concordia Lutheran School, before transferring to Lincoln High School after his freshman season. He lettered in football, basketball, and baseball.

He enrolled at Central Washington University. He walked on to the football team and was named the starter at quarterback as a true freshman over Beau Baldwin. He passed for 1,964 yards.

As a sophomore, he posted 3,241 yards. He had 6 touchdown passes against Pacific Lutheran University. As a junior, he registered 2,532 passing yards. He passed for 456 yards and 7 touchdowns against Pacific Lutheran University.

As a senior, he started 14 games, tallying 4,616 passing yards (NAIA Division II record) on 364-of-576 completions (63.1%), 42 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, while leading the Wildcats to the NAIA Football National Championship. He surpassed 300 passing yards in 8 contests. He had 455 passing yards and 4 touchdowns against Western Washington University. He passed for 454 yards against Whitworth University.

Kitna finished his college career with 43 games played, 911-of-1,550 completions (58.8%), 12,353 passing yards, 99 touchdowns and 59 interceptions. He set the NAIA record for career total offense with 12,907 yards. He had 17 games with over 300 passing yards.

In 2006, he was inducted into the Central Washington University Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2014, he was inducted into the Pacific Northwest Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Seattle Seahawks===
====1996 season====

Believing that his football career was over after the NAIA championship, Kitna finished his math education degree at Central Washington and began applying for high-school coaching jobs. Seattle Seahawks head coach Dennis Erickson visited the campus to give a tryout for his nephew, Bryce Erickson, a receiver on the Central Washington team. Impressed by Kitna&#x27;s strong passes, the Seahawks signed him as an undrafted free agent on April 25.

He was waived on August 19 and signed to the practice squad on August 26, where he remained for the rest of the season.

====1997 season====

Kitna was allocated to the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football. He appeared in 10 games, posting 171 completions (led the league), 317 pass attempts (led the league), a 53.9% average, 2,448 passing yards (led the league), 22 passing touchdowns (led the league), 15 interceptions. He set the league record for quarterbacks with 334 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns.

He was the runner-up to T. J. Rubley for World League MVP honors and was named the MVP of the title game, when he led the Barcelona Dragons to a 38–24 World Bowl V win over the Rhein Fire, completing 23-of-31 passes for 401 yards (league record), 2 touchdowns and one interception.

He returned to the Seahawks and was the third-string quarterback behind John Friesz and Warren Moon. On December 14, he had his first career start against the Oakland Raiders after Moon injured his ribs, leading the team to the second biggest comeback in franchise history, from a 21–3 halftime deficit to a 22–21 win. Moon returned to start in the season finale against the San Francisco 49ers. Kitna played in 3 games, making 23-of-37 completions for 283 yards, one touchdown and 2 interceptions.

====1998 season====

Kitna was the team&#x27;s deactivated third-string quarterback in 10 of the first 11 games. He made the first start of the season and second of his career against the Tennessee Oilers and earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, after passing for 298 yards, 2 touchdowns and one interception, while leading a fourth-quarter comeback for the deciding 48-yard field goal in a 20–18 win.

He completed 17-of-24 attempts in the next game against the New York Jets, for 278 yards, 2 touchdowns, 3 carries for 25 yards and 2 interceptions. He had a 70-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway in the first quarter and followed it 3 minutes later with a second 57-yard touchdown pass to Galloway. He also rushed three times for 25 yards at the Jets.

In the fifteenth game against the Indianapolis Colts, he rallied the team to score 17 fourth quarter points in a 27–23 win, making 16-of-29 completions for 177 yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He ended the season by passing for 242 yards, one touchdown and one interception against the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos.

He was named the starting quarterback for the last 5 contests, leading the team to a 3–2 record. He finished with 98-of-172 completions (57.0%) for 1,177 yards, 7 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. Five of his 7 touchdown passes went to wide receiver Joey Galloway.

====1999 season====

Kitna started 15 games for the Seahawks. He did not play in the second game against the Chicago Bears due to a sprained toe he suffered in the season opener against the Detroit Lions. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October, after guiding the club to a 3–1 record, while throwing for 7 touchdowns and just 2 interceptions.

He led the team to a 9–7 record (Kitna going 8–7 in games started), winning the AFC West and into the playoffs for the first time since 1988. Seattle would end up losing 20–17 in the wild card game against the Miami Dolphins. He posted 270-of-495 completions (54.5%) for 3,346 yards (fifth in the AFC), 23 touchdown passes (third in the AFC) and 16 interceptions.

====2000 season====

In 2000, Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren was concerned with Kitna&#x27;s preseason performance and tried to work a trade for Green Bay Packers backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, although it did not come through.

Kitna began the season with a four-interception performance against the Miami Dolphins, which opened the door for Holmgren to put second-year quarterback Brock Huard in the game. Kitna started the next 4 contests, before being replaced by Huard in the sixth game against the Carolina Panthers. Huard suffered a concussion two games later in the second quarter against the Oakland Raiders, which forced him to miss 3 games and put Kitna back in the starter role.

On November 5, down 15–14 on 3rd-and-16 with 1:28 left in the game, Kitna dodged a possible 17-yard sack by San Diego Chargers defensive end Neil Smith and made an 18-yard pass to Darrell Jackson. This pass set up the game-winning field goal by Rian Lindell.

Huard returned as the starter in the thirteenth game against the Denver Broncos, but suffered a season-ending kidney injury in the first quarter. Kitna went on to start the last 4 contests. His last win for the Seahawks came on a rain-soaked Husky Stadium turf in December of that year, beating the AFC Championship Game-bound Oakland Raiders on a touchdown pass to rookie Darrell Jackson in the final minute of play.

The Seahawks were 6–6 in his 12 starts and 0–4 in the other games. He registered 259-of-418 completions (54.5%) for 2,658 yards, 18 touchdowns and 19 interceptions. Holmgren chose not to re-sign Kitna after the season.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
====2001 season====
On March 8, he signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Cincinnati Bengals. He won the starting quarterback job in preseason over Scott Mitchell and went on to start 15 games. He opened the regular season winning his first 2 starts, becoming the first Bengals quarterback since Greg Cook in 1969 to accomplish the feat.

In the sixteenth game overtime 26–23 win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he threw for a franchise-record 68 passes, tied for the third most in NFL history. He had 35 completions for 411 yards, 2 touchdowns and received AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.

In the season finale against the Tennessee Titans, he had 340 passing yards, setting a team record for passing yards in consecutive games with 751. He finished with 313 completions, 581 attempts (team record), a 53.9% average, 3,216 passing yards, 12 touchdowns and 22 interceptions.

====2002 season====
Although he was the backup quarterback behind Gus Frerotte for the first 4 games, Kitna started the final 12 contests to help fix a struggling offense. He had 11 games (combined rushing and passing) of 300-or-more yards as well as six straight 350-yard games (Games 7–12), the franchise&#x27;s longest such streak since 1986.

In the eighth game against the Houston Texans, he had 22-of-27 completions (81.5%) for 263 yards and 4 touchdowns. In the fifteenth game against the New Orleans Saints, he led the offense on a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown drives to overcome a 7–13 deficit and get a 20–13 win. In the season, he collected 294-of-473 completions (62.2%) for 3,178 yards, 16 touchdowns, 16 interceptions, 24 carries for 57 yards and 4 rushing touchdowns.

====2003 season====
Kitna played every offensive down and became the first player in franchise history to throw every one of the team&#x27;s passes in a single-season. He threw 137 straight passes with no interceptions. In the twelfth game 34–27 win against the San Diego Chargers, he tied his career high with four touchdown passes. In the thirteenth game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he led a 24–20 comeback win, making a game-winning 18-yard touchdown pass with 13 seconds remaining.

He was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year after throwing for over 3,500 yards and 26 touchdown passes (second in the AFC) in leading the Bengals to an 8–8 record, the team&#x27;s first non-losing season since 1996.

====2004 season====
Kitna&#x27;s secondary role with the team was to prepare young quarterback Carson Palmer (the Bengals&#x27; #1 draft pick in 2003). It was a role Kitna accepted gracefully. The two quarterbacks developed a close friendship off the field, particularly because both men are avid golfers.

By 2004, Palmer was ready to take over the starting job, leading the Bengals to another 8–8 season. Kitna was the backup quarterback until seeing his first action of the season in the thirteenth game against the New England Patriots, due to a season-ending knee injury to Palmer. He made 9-of-13 completions for 126 yards and one touchdown in a 28–35 loss.

In his first start of the season against the Buffalo Bills, he made 16-of-32 completions for 151 yards and one touchdown. He led the team to a 23–22 win against the New York Giants, throwing a four-yard touchdown pass with 0:44 remaining, while also completing 20-of-32 passes for 186 yards, 2 touchdowns and one interception. In the season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, he completed 16-of-27 passes for 160 yards and one touchdown, winning 38–10 against the eventual NFC champions.

====2005 season====
Kitna entered his first game of the season during the fourth quarter against the Detroit Lions and led the offense on a field goal drive. He played in the final offensive series against the Buffalo Bills and went 2-of-2 for 17 yards. He replaced Palmer in the second quarter of the season finale against the Kansas City Chiefs, completing 13-of-24 passes for 76 yards and 2 interceptions in a 37–3 loss.

He was unexpectedly thrust back behind center during the Bengals&#x27; AFC Wild Card Playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 8, 2006. Palmer went down with a left knee injury on his second play from scrimmage and Kitna stepped in off the bench and into a relief role. Kitna finished 24-of-40 for 197 yards, one touchdown and 2 interceptions and one fumble as the Bengals fell to the eventual Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17.

===Detroit Lions===
====2006 season====
On March 14, he signed with the Detroit Lions as an unrestricted free agent, to compete with Josh McCown for the quarterback position. Kitna was named the starter and became the first quarterback in franchise history to take every snap in a single-season.

He registered 372 completions (franchise record), 596 attempts (franchise record), 62.4 pass completion rate (second in franchise history), 4,208 passing yards (second in franchise history), 21 touchdowns (fourth in franchise history) and 22 interceptions. He also became the second quarterback in franchise history after Scott Mitchell, to pass for 4,000 yards in one season. His four 300-yard passing games were the fourth-most in the NFL.

====2007 season====
The Lions offense was ranked ninth in the league in passing, with Kitna starting all 16 games, while throwing for 4,068 yards, 18 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. He set a single-game franchise record and a personal career-high with 442 passing yards against the Philadelphia Eagles. He became the first quarterback in franchise history with back-to-back 4,000-yard seasons.

====2008 season====
Kitna suffered a back injury in the fourth game of the season and was placed on the injured reserve list on October 14. The Lions became the first NFL team to finish a season with no wins and 16 losses.

He passed Charlie Batch for the eighth place on Detroit&#x27;s all-time passing list with 9,034 yards. He finished with 68-of-120 (56.7%) for 758 yards and 5 touchdowns.

On February 28, 2009, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for cornerback Anthony Henry.

===Dallas Cowboys===
In 2009, the Cowboys acquired Kitna to improve their backup quarterback situation, after Brad Johnson had a 1–2 record, including a 35–14 loss against the New York Giants when Tony Romo was injured during the previous season. Kitna did not play a single down for the Cowboys in the regular season.

In 2010, Kitna remained idle until October 25, when Romo suffered a broken clavicle against the New York Giants and was later placed on the injured reserve list on December 21. Kitna ended up suffering an abdominal injury against the Arizona Cardinals on Christmas Day, and was replaced with second-year quarterback Stephen McGee for the rest of the season. Kitna played well in relief of Romo throwing for 2,365 yards, 16 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in the 9 games he started, compiling a 4–5 record and a career-high 88.9 passer rating in the process.

In 2011, he suffered a herniated disk problem in training camp that limited him to only 3 games. In his last action, he took the last snap on a 44–7 victory over the Buffalo Bills on November 13. He couldn&#x27;t play the rest of the season because his back condition never improved. He was placed on the injured reserve list on December 14. McGee was promoted to backup quarterback in his place. The injury forced him to announce his retirement from the NFL on January 12, 2012.

On Christmas Eve, 2013, Kitna was called out of retirement to serve as an emergency back-up behind quarterback Kyle Orton, for the season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, following a back injury to Romo. He donated his game salary ($55,294 before taxes) to the Lincoln High School Booster Club.

==Coaching career==
From 2012 to 2014, Kitna was a math teacher and head football coach at alma mater, Lincoln High School. As coach he led the team to a 5–5 record in the 2012 season. Lincoln improved to 8–2 in 2013 and 11–1 in 2014. Lincoln shared the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) District 3A Narrows regular season championship in 2013, with a 5–1 conference record tied with Lacey Timberline. In 2014, Lincoln went 7–0 in conference play and won the outright regular season championship.

In January 2015, he resigned from Lincoln and accepted the head coaching job at Waxahachie High School in Waxahachie, Texas, south of Dallas.

In February 2018, Kitna was hired at Brophy College Preparatory, an all-men Jesuit high school in Phoenix, Arizona. He guided the football team to a 7–4 record and a state appearance.

In June 2018, he was named the offensive coordinator for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football, which began play in 2019. However, he did not coach a game for the Fleet as he joined the Dallas Cowboys staff in January to become their quarterbacks coach and work with Dak Prescott. In 2020, he was not retained by new Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy.

In March 2020, Kitna was hired as the football head coach and athletic coordinator at Burleson High School in Burleson, Texas. 
He would coach there until the 2022 season.

In February 2023, Kitna was hired as the head football coach and dean of students at Lakota East High School in Liberty Township, Ohio.

==Personal life==
Kitna became a Christian while attending Central Washington University. His parents, who had previously been non-religious, later became Christians as well. Kitna has four children with his wife. His son Jalen Kitna was a quarterback at Florida, but was dismissed from the team in December 2022 after being arrested on child pornography charges. The charges were later reduced to a misdemeanor after investigation, and he was able to re-enroll in classes. Jalen has since committed to play for the UAB Blazers for the 2024 season.

<text>Carson Hilton Palmer (born December 27, 1979) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons, primarily with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Arizona Cardinals. He played college football for the USC Trojans, winning the Heisman Trophy as a senior in 2002.

Palmer was selected by the Bengals first overall in the 2003 NFL draft, and played eight seasons with the team. During his tenure in Cincinnati, he helped lead the team to its first winning season and playoff appearance in 15 years and was named to two Pro Bowls. Amid declining success and conflicts with Bengals ownership, Palmer was traded to the Oakland Raiders, where he played two seasons before joining Arizona.

With the Cardinals, Palmer enjoyed his most successful year in 2015 when he led the Cardinals to a division title and an NFC Championship Game appearance. Palmer was also named to his third Pro Bowl and received second-team All-Pro honors. He retired following the 2017 regular season after spending much of the year on injured reserve.

==Early life==
Palmer was born in Fresno, California. By the time he was in seventh grade, Palmer had remarkable size and arm strength for his age. His father, Bill Palmer, enrolled him in private classes in Orange County, where he was later taught by quarterback guru Bob Johnson.

He went on to attend Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. At Santa Margarita High School, he played on their high school football team. As the quarterback on the freshman team, Palmer was so good that members of the varsity team halted practices to watch him play. After a successful stint as a starter his junior year, Palmer received offers from USC, Notre Dame, Colorado, Miami (Florida), and reportedly San Diego State and Northern Arizona University (where his mother attended college). He followed up a stellar junior season with a remarkable senior season, cementing himself as one of the most touted players ever to come out of Santa Margarita Catholic High School. In his senior season, he led Orange County with a 203.9 quarterback rating. He was named to the first-team all-league and All-CIF despite suffering a stress fracture in his right foot. Palmer finished his high school career with 27 school records and 2 straight CIF championships.

==College career==
===Freshman season===

Palmer entered the University of Southern California in 1998, where he played for head coach Paul Hackett the first three years of his college career. He began the season as a back-up to Mike Van Raaphorst. They split time throughout the first 8 games, with Palmer mainly coming in during the second half. The Trojans&#x27; season opener was played against Purdue. Palmer only played for three series in the second half and went 3-of-6 and 79 passing yards. The next week, he came in at quarterback during the third quarter and threw his first career touchdown pass while playing against San Diego State. In week 4, he almost played the entire second half in a 30–10 loss to the number-10 Florida State. He bounced back the next week in a comeback win against Arizona State, finishing the game with 4 completions for 69 yards and a touchdown. In the week-8 match-up with Oregon, he came in sporadically but finished the game with a season-high 10/19 completions for 179 yards. After losing to Oregon, Palmer got his first career start the next week against Washington, making him the first true freshman quarterback to start for USC since Rob Johnson in 1991. He finished the game with 18/31 completions, 279 passing yards, and 1 touchdown. He continued as the starter the next week, racking up 19-of-26 completions, 203 yards, and a touchdown in a win against Stanford. In week 11, Palmer started against number 3 UCLA, in what was his toughest test yet. Although his team lost, he had a career-high 28/43 completions, 252 yards, and 1 passing touchdown. The Trojans won 10–0 against #9 Notre Dame in their regular season finale, with Palmer finishing with 14/32 completions, 188 passing yards, and his first career rushing touchdown. Palmer started his first career bowl game against TCU in the Sun Bowl. He was sacked 6 times and completed 17-of-28 passes, 280 passing yards, and 1 touchdown. He ended his freshman season with 130 completions, 235 attempts(55.3%), 1,755 passing yards, 116 rushing yards, 7 passing touchdowns, 6 interceptions, and a rushing touchdown.

===Sophomore seasons===

Going into his sophomore year in 1999, he was named the starting quarterback of the Trojans. The season opener was against Hawaii and Palmer played in a little more than two quarters. He finished the game with 14/16 completions (87.5%), 167 passing yards, 1 touchdown pass, and a 9-yard rushing touchdown. The next week against San Diego State he completed 16/24 passes for 188 passing yards and 2 touchdowns. On September 25, Palmer started the game against Oregon, throwing 9 completions for 135 yards. Before halftime, he broke his collarbone while scrambling for a 3-yard gain. This injury effectively ended his season. In only three games he had 39/53 completions (73.6%), 490 passing yards, 3 passing touchdowns, 3 interceptions, and a single rushing touchdown. The NCAA let him use his redshirt, although he had already played in 3 games.

After being sidelined for the last 11 months, Palmer returned to his starting role in 2000. He made his return in week 1 against #22 Penn State, going for 10/20 completions for 87 yards and an interception. The following game, Palmer led the Trojans 72-yards down the field with 1:14 left in the fourth quarter. This set up the game-winning field goal against Colorado, putting USC up 17–14. He threw for 25/30(83.3%), 275 passing yards, and a touchdown. The very next week he led another comeback win against San Jose State, bringing USC back from a 12-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Palmer ended the game with 22/38 completions, a career-high 338 passing yards, and 2 touchdowns. After 5 consecutive losses, he started in week 10 against Arizona State and end the game with 22 of 37 completions, for 279 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions in the double overtime victory. Palmer started the first half the next game against the Washington and was benched the second half for Mike Van Raaphorst, after going 12 of 26 for 145 yards and an interception. After being benched, he returned against rival UCLA the next game, and had a career-high 350 yards, and 4 touchdowns while throwing 26/37 completions. His performance against the Bruins won him PAC-10 Offensive Player of the Week and USC&#x27;s Game MVP. In the regular season finale, against Notre Dame, he completed 17 of 35 passes for 251 yards, 2 passing touchdowns, 2 interceptions, and lead USC with 22-yards rushing and 1 rushing touchdown. USC finished the season with a 5–7 record and Palmer finished with 228 completions, 414 attempts(54.9%) 2914 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions.

===Junior season===

Following a 6–6 record in 1999 and a 5–7 record in 2000, Paul Hackett stepped down as head coach. 2001 marked Pete Carroll&#x27;s first season with USC and under a new revamped offense, Palmer threw 21/28 completions, 213 passing yards, and an interception in the season opener against San Jose State. During a week 4 loss at Oregon, he threw 25/40 completions, for a career-high 411 yards, 3 interceptions, and a career-high 75-yard touchdown pass and a 93-yard touchdown pass. After four consecutive losses, where he threw a total of 4 touchdowns and 5 interceptions, USC finally received a win against Arizona State with Palmer going 18/26 for 295 passing yards and 3 touchdowns. The next week at Notre Dame, although being sacked 5 times, he finished with 19 of 30 completions, 230 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions. Palmer defeated Oregon State in week 10, after going 21 of 28, for 171 passing yards, and an interception. The game came down to overtime, where Palmer bootlegged for a 4-yard scramble, broke one tackle, and dove at the pylon for the game-winning touchdown. After 4 wins in-a-row, USC lost to Utah, and Palmer finished the game with 15 of 26 completions for 150 yards. Although his first season under new head coach Pete Carroll ended with a 6–6 record, he finished his season with 221 completions, 377 attempts(58.6%), 2,717 passing yards, 13 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions in 12 starts.

===Senior season===

After proving himself to be one of the nation&#x27;s top college quarterbacks his junior year, Palmer returned to USC for a fifth year in 2002. He resumed the role of starting quarterback for the fourth consecutive year and was voted the team captain. He finished the season opener against Auburn with 23 of 32 completions, 302 passing yards, 1 passing touchdown, and 2 interceptions in a 24–17 victory. With only 1:26 seconds to go in the fourth quarter, he ran the ball in for a 1-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak to win the game. USC matched up against #25 Kansas State in week 3, and Palmer became USC&#x27;s career leader in passing yards and completions after completing 18 of 46 passes for 186 yards and a touchdown. He came back in week 7 to throw 21 of 34 completions for 348 passing yards and 4 passing touchdowns against #19 Washington. Palmer then had a record-setting day the next week against #14 Oregon when he broke the school records with 31/42 completions(73.8%), 448 passing yards, and tied the record with 5 passing touchdowns. In week 11 against #25 UCLA, he racked up 19/32 completions for 254 passing yards and 4 passing touchdowns, winning his third PAC-10 Offensive Player of the Week for the 2002 season and becoming the career leader for passes, completions, and attempts in the PAC-10. He returned the next game to throw another 4 touchdowns, while also throwing the most yards ever (425) against Notre Dame. He played his last collegiate game in the 2003 Orange Bowl against #3 Iowa, finishing with 21 of 31 completions, 303 passing yards, and a touchdown, while also being named the game&#x27;s MVP.

====Heisman Trophy====
Palmer finished his last season with a total of 309 completions, 489 attempts(63.2%), 3,942 passing yards, 33 touchdown passes, and 10 interceptions while also breaking the school record for most completions, passing yards, and passing touchdowns in a season. He was voted the winner of the 2002 Heisman Award, outpacing Iowa&#x27;s Brad Banks and Penn State&#x27;s Larry Johnson. Palmer was the fifth player and first quarterback from USC to win the award. After five years at USC, he finished his career with 72 passing touchdowns, 49 interceptions, 927 completions, 1,569 attempts, and 11,818 passing yards. He also ended up being the Pac-10&#x27;s career leader for completions, attempts, and passing yards.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Cincinnati Bengals===

====2003 season====

On July 23, 2003, Palmer signed a six-year contract worth $42.69 million after being selected first overall by the Cincinnati Bengals. Unlike most quarterbacks drafted first overall, Palmer did not play at all during his rookie season; instead, he learned the position during games and in practice under head coach Marvin Lewis and quarterbacks coach Ken Zampese. Veteran quarterback Jon Kitna, who signed with the Bengals as an unrestricted free agent in 2001, took every snap during the 2003 season.

====2004 season====

After learning the position during his rookie season, Palmer was given the starting quarterback position for the 2004 season and started 13 games; the Bengals finished that season 8–8.

Palmer made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the New York Jets. Palmer completed 18 of 27 passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns, but threw a costly interception late as the Jets held on to beat the Bengals, 31–24. &quot;We came here expecting to win,&quot; Palmer said. &quot;We had what we needed. We had what we wanted. We had the ball with two minutes to go in good field position and I turned it over. I can&#x27;t make plays like that for us to win.&quot;

Over the next three weeks, Palmer struggled. In Week 2, he completed 21 of 38 passes for just 147 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception, but nonetheless recorded his first win as a starter over the Miami Dolphins. In Week 3, he completed 25 of 52 passes for 316 passing yards, but was picked off 3 times and lost a fumble in the 23–9 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. &quot;You can&#x27;t get greedy,&quot; Palmer said. &quot;When you&#x27;re a young quarterback, you get greedy, and I have to fight that temptation. You need to develop patience. When something isn&#x27;t there, you don&#x27;t just throw it up in the air.&quot; In Week 4, Palmer was 20/37 for 164 yards with a touchdown but 2 costly interceptions as the Bengals lost 28–17 to a powerful Pittsburgh Steelers team. Palmer went into the Bengals&#x27; week 5 bye with statistics of 84–154 for 875 yards with only three passing touchdowns against 11 sacks, eight total turnovers (seven interceptions and a lost fumble), and three straight games with passer rating of less than 60. The Bengals, meanwhile, were 1–3 and in last place in the AFC North.

Palmer&#x27;s performance improved from this low point, though it seesawed over the next five weeks. His rating was in the 60s in Weeks 6 (34–17 loss to the Cleveland Browns), 8 (27–20 loss to the Tennessee Titans), and 10 (17–10 win against the Washington Redskins), interspersed by a solid 85.0 in a Week 7 win over the Denver Broncos, and 94.8 in a win over the Dallas Cowboys, where he also rushed for a touchdown. In that stretch, Palmer averaged 204 yards per game with four touchdowns and five interceptions. After two touchdowns in a loss to Pittsburgh, in Week 12 Palmer threw a career high four touchdowns along three interceptions and 251 passing yards in a 58–48 shootout win over the Browns (106 points was the second most points in an NFL game). &quot;We kept putting them away, and they kept coming back,&quot; said Palmer. &quot;We kept expecting them to slacken up, but they never did.&quot; In Week 13, Palmer threw for a career high 382 passing yards and 3 touchdown passes, including a 32-yard pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh and a 22-yard pass to Chad Johnson to set up Shayne Graham&#x27;s game-winning field goal with 2 seconds left in the game.

In Week 14, Palmer&#x27;s passer rating was above 100 for the third consecutive week when he sprained his knee in the third quarter. He missed the rest of the season and first put on the knee brace he wore for much of the rest of his career. His injury-shortened season ended with 18 touchdowns, 18 interceptions, and 2,897 yards.

====2005 season====

In 2005, the Palmer-led Bengals ended 15 years of futility by notching their first winning season since 1990 and winning the AFC North division with an 11–5 record.

Statistically, Palmer had a stellar season, throwing a league-high 32 touchdown passes and leading the league in completion percentage. He became the first Bengals quarterback to finish with a quarterback rating over 100 and he also tied Indianapolis&#x27; Peyton Manning for most consecutive games, 9, with a triple-digit quarterback rating.

In Week 1, Palmer completed 26 of 34 passes and 2 passing touchdowns against the Cleveland Browns. The Bengals won the game 27–13. In Week 2, Palmer had another great game, throwing for 337 yards to go along with 3 passing touchdowns and an interception against the Minnesota Vikings. Palmer threw 3 more touchdown passes in Week 3 against the Chicago Bears to improve to 3–0. That was the first time the Bengals have started the season 3–0 since 1990.

In Week 4, Palmer again had a rating over 100 in a game against the Houston Texans. Against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 5, Carson completed 22 out of 33 passes for 239 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, the Bengals lost their first game of the year, 23–20. The Bengals bounced back against the Tennessee Titans in Week 6. Palmer threw for 272 passing yards and 2 more passing touchdowns. His rating was over 100 for the ninth straight game dating back to last season. &quot;He feels like he&#x27;s invincible, but right now he knows he can go win it the next play,&quot; Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis said of his quarterback. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have to win it on every play. And I think that says a lot for how he is and how important he is to this football team.&quot;

Palmer&#x27;s consecutive games streak of over a 100 quarterback rating ended in Week 7 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Palmer completed 21 of 36 passes for 227 yards but was picked off 2 times and for the first time all season, failed to throw at least a touchdown in a game. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t anything in particular they did,&quot; said Palmer, who had a measly 53.8 passer rating for the game. &quot;I just didn&#x27;t play well enough to win. I gave them two turnovers. When you play a championship team, you can&#x27;t do that.&quot;

Palmer bounced back in Week 8 against the Green Bay Packers. He threw for 3 touchdown passes and an interception for 237 yards and the Bengals won the game, 21–14.

In Week 9, Palmer passed for 248 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Bengals won their game against the Baltimore Ravens. Palmer finished the season with a 101.1 rating.

Carson signed a six-year contract extension through the 2014 season with the Bengals on December 29, 2005. In addition to the three years remaining on his existing deal, the value of the extension was worth $118.75 million over nine years. &quot;Hopefully this is the last place I&#x27;ll end up playing,&quot; Palmer said. &quot;That&#x27;s so rare in this league these days. It&#x27;s so rare to see a person have a 5-, 8-, 10-, 12-year career in one place. And I feel very fortunate that it looks like that&#x27;s going to be my future.&quot;

On January 8, 2006, the Bengals met their division rival Pittsburgh in the first round of the AFC playoffs at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati. On the Bengals&#x27; first pass play, Carson Palmer threw a 66-yard pass to rookie receiver Chris Henry. It was the longest completion in Bengals playoff history. After Palmer released the pass, Steelers defensive tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen dove laterally into Palmer&#x27;s left knee. Forty minutes later, a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed a severe injury, thought to be career-threatening at the time; Palmer had tears of both the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments as well as cartilage and meniscus damage, and a displaced kneecap. Coincidentally, Henry himself suffered a knee injury on the same play, though far less severe. With Palmer out of the game, the Steelers went on to win 31–17 en route to their Super Bowl XL victory over the Seattle Seahawks.

During the off-season, the league&#x27;s Rules Committee modified the rule regarding low hits on quarterbacks. The so-called &quot;Carson Palmer Rule&quot; which resulted requires that defenders take every opportunity to avoid hitting a quarterback at or below the knees when the quarterback is in a defenseless position looking to throw with both feet on the ground, unless they are blocked into him.

====Rehabilitation====

Palmer underwent reconstructive surgery on his injured knee in Houston, Texas, on January 10, 2006. Lonnie Paulos, a surgeon who was independent of the Bengals, performed the operation. Initially, the Bengals organization stated that Palmer had torn the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments with no other damage. However, Paulos later told the Associated Press that the damage was more extensive and also included a dislocation of the patella. Paulos called the injury &quot;devastating and potentially career-ending&quot;. The Bengals accepted Paulos&#x27;s assessment. Palmer&#x27;s knee was reconstructed using an Achilles tendon from a 44-year-old woman who was killed by a drunk driver nearly two years before Palmer&#x27;s injury.

Nonetheless, Palmer vowed that he was to be the starting quarterback in the Bengals&#x27; regular season opener at Kansas City on September 10, 2006. Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis stated, &quot;This is a serious injury, but we are told the procedure went very well. We know Carson, and we know he will apply himself fully to his rehabilitation. This result encourages our feeling that Carson will be ready to open the 2006 season as our starting quarterback.&quot;

During his rehabilitation, Palmer made several other pointed comments, particularly in an issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. In the article, Palmer stated that: &quot;I hate the Steelers more than I hate UCLA.&quot;

====2006 season====


Palmer returned from his injury in time for the 2006 preseason. After the Bengals&#x27; 48–17 pre-season victory over the visiting Green Bay Packers on August 28, 2006, which saw Palmer complete 9 of 14 passes for 140 yards and three touchdowns in just less than two quarters of play in his much-expected debut (which included an 11-yard run for a first down that culminated in a slide on his surgically repaired left knee), Palmer reiterated his position that he was to start in the Bengals&#x27; season opener at Kansas City.

His performance drew rave reviews from many experts, many of whom expected far less of him less than a year after such a serious injury. ESPN analyst Joe Theismann, himself a former quarterback with the Washington Redskins (whose own career was ended by a gruesome broken leg against the New York Giants on November 18, 1985), praised Palmer for his mental toughness in taking hits and not being gun-shy about staying in the pocket where chances of injury are often high.

Palmer ended up starting all 16 of the Bengals&#x27; regular season games, missing only one snap, due to his getting the wind knocked out of him. He did not become totally comfortable with his repaired knee until Week 9 against the San Diego Chargers when he threw for a career high of 440 yards. Despite his previous injury, he passed the 4,000 yard mark for the first time in his career, finishing the season with a franchise record 4,035 passing yards and 28 touchdowns, only 13 interceptions and 93.9 rating. He also made the Pro Bowl for the second year in a row, becoming the first Bengals quarterback to do this since Boomer Esiason in 1988 and 1989. Palmer was named Most Outstanding Player at the Pro Bowl, leading the AFC down the field in the final two minutes for the win. He completed 8 of 17 passes for 190 yards and 2 touchdowns, one to his Bengals teammate Chad Johnson. Palmer placed 3rd in voting for NFL Comeback Player of the Year, behind Drew Brees and Chad Pennington. Unfortunately, his team suffered quite a few misfortunes, such as missed point afters and field goals, while slipping from an 11–5 record in 2005 to 8–8 in 2006 and failing to make the playoffs due to a game 16 loss against their rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

After winning the Pro Bowl MVP, Palmer declared, &quot;This is a huge honor and extremely exciting and I feel very blessed just to be here, let alone for the outcome to be this. But my goal&#x27;s to be in a Super Bowl. And to win a Super Bowl. That&#x27;s where my mind&#x27;s at, and after this week I&#x27;m going to start focusing on that again.&quot; During the 2007 off-season, Palmer had scheduled workouts with not only Chad Johnson (which he usually did), but wide receivers T. J. Houshmandzadeh and Tab Perry. He also said he was fully comfortable with his knee.

====2007 season====

In the season opener on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; against their divisional rival Baltimore Ravens, Palmer went 20 for 32 with 194 yards and two touchdowns in a 27–20 win. He followed up this performance with 33 completions for 401 passing yards and a franchise record and also a career-high six touchdown passes the next week in a game against the Cleveland Browns, but lost 51–45. Cleveland quarterback Derek Anderson also threw for five touchdown passes in the game. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. In a 24–21 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Palmer went 27 for 43 for 342 yards for a touchdown, but also threw two interceptions.

By Week 8, Palmer and the Bengals were struggling. His team had only a 2–5 record and he had thrown 9 interceptions, the most by any quarterback in the AFC. However, he remained statistically productive, ranking fourth in the NFL in passing yards and fifth in touchdowns with a passer rating of over 90.

The Bengals&#x27; misfortunes continued throughout the season and a week 15 loss to the San Francisco 49ers ensured that the team finished the season with a losing record for the first time since he had been their starting quarterback. In the same game, Palmer threw his 100th career touchdown pass, becoming the 5th fastest player ever to reach this milestone (59 games). Palmer finished the season with 376 completions for 4,131 yards and 26 touchdowns, with 20 interceptions. His 20 interceptions were a career high, but his 373 completions and 4,131 passing yards set new Bengals franchise records.

====2008 season====

In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Palmer was held to 99 yards and no touchdowns, completing only 10 out of 25 passes with an interception. For the first time in his career, Palmer wore a clear protective visor because of a broken nose. In the following 24–7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Palmer went 16 of 27 for 134 yards and two interceptions. As the Bengals fell to 0–3 against the New York Giants in a 26–23 overtime loss, Palmer went 27 for 39 for 286 yards and a touchdown.

Due to a sore elbow, Palmer missed the next game against the Cleveland Browns, which ended in a loss. This ended Palmer&#x27;s consecutive start streak of 51 games. Palmer returned the following week against the Dallas Cowboys and completed 23 of 39 passes for 217 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception on the first passing play of the game.

The cause of Palmer&#x27;s sore elbow was later diagnosed as a partially torn ligament and tendon and he was shelved for the remainder of the season. Palmer elected not to undergo Tommy John surgery to repair the damage; instead, he chose to rest the elbow to allow it to heal. By March 2009, Palmer said that he was &quot;100 percent&quot; again.

====2009 season====

In the season opener against the Denver Broncos, Palmer threw the ball 33 times for 247 yards and two interceptions in a 12–7 loss. The critics sought another mediocre season for the Bengals, with a lack of offensive production. The offense bounced back in week 2 against the Green Bay Packers. Palmer threw for 185 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in a 31–24 win. In week 7 against the Chicago Bears, Palmer went 20 of 24 with five touchdowns and a passer rating of 146.7, in a 45–10 win. This win improved the Bengals&#x27; record to 5–2. After a 16–7 win against the Cleveland Browns in Week 12, the Bengals swept their division for the first time in franchise history. Going into a Week 15 game against the San Diego Chargers, Bengals&#x27; receiver Chris Henry died. Playing with a heavy heart, Palmer threw for 314 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, only to lose on a last second field goal by the Chargers. Palmer had a 91.7 passer rating with two touchdowns and one interception in a 17–10 Week 16 win against the Kansas City Chiefs. This win assured the Bengals&#x27; first winning season and division title since 2005. In Palmer&#x27;s first full playoff game, he struggled. Palmer threw the ball with a 50% completion percentage, one touchdown, one interception, and a 53.8 passer rating, in a 24–14 loss to the New York Jets. Palmer finished the 2009 season with a 60.5% completion percentage, 3,094 yards passing, 21 touchdowns, 13 interceptions, and a passer rating of 83.6.

====2010 season and initial retirement====

In the 2010 NFL draft, the Bengals drafted three more receivers for Palmer: Oklahoma tight end Jermaine Gresham in the first round, Texas wide receiver Jordan Shipley in the third round, and Kansas wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe in the sixth round. During OTA&#x27;s (Organized Team Activities), Palmer asserted himself as the leader of the team by calling out Chad Ochocinco, saying that the number one receiver should be there with the team.

During the 2010 Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio, Palmer completed 2 out of 5 passes for 18 yards, both to wide receiver Terrell Owens. Palmer and the Bengals started out the 2010 campaign with a 2–1 record, but faltered after that, going on a 10-game losing streak to finish out the season with a 4–12 record. Statistically, Carson improved from the previous year as his attempts, completion percentage, yardage and touchdown numbers all rose (although he did throw more interceptions as well).

Following the Bengals&#x27; 4–12 finish in the 2010 season, Palmer requested to be traded. Bengals president Mike Brown turned down Palmer&#x27;s request the next day. News reports said that Palmer was prepared to retire if necessary. WCPO-TV reported that a friend of Palmer quoted him as saying, &quot;I will never set foot in Paul Brown Stadium again. I have $80 million in the bank.&quot; Palmer also reportedly said: &quot;I don&#x27;t have to play football for money. I&#x27;ll play it for the love of the game, but that would have to be elsewhere.&quot; Palmer&#x27;s agent said, &quot;Because of the lack of success that Carson and the Bengals have experienced together, Carson strongly feels that a separation between him and the Bengals would be in the best interest of both parties.&quot; In seven seasons under Palmer, the Bengals appeared in the playoffs twice (2005 and 2009), and did not win any playoff games.

During an interview at the 2011 NFL draft, head coach Marvin Lewis said that Palmer told him he has planned to retire. In response, the Bengals selected TCU quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round. On July 26, 2011, a video posted on NFL.com showed a press conference held by Mike Brown, the president of the Bengals, stating that he did not expect Palmer to return to the Bengals for the 2011 season, the organization wished him well, and that there were no plans to trade him. When asked why he refused to trade Palmer, Mike Brown answered:

Carson signed a contract. He made a commitment. He gave his word. We relied on his word. We relied on his commitment. We expected him to perform here. He&#x27;s going to walk away from his commitment. We aren&#x27;t going to reward him for doing it.

Consequently, Palmer was placed on the reserve/did not report list on July 29, 2011, after failing to report to training camp.

===Oakland Raiders===
====2011 season====

With Bengals rookie quarterback Andy Dalton having led his team to a conference-best 6–2 record after 9 weeks, the Bengals had little motivation to negotiate for Palmer&#x27;s return. However, on October 18, 2011, after being contacted by the Oakland Raiders who had just lost starting quarterback Jason Campbell for the season and who were desperate to negotiate for Palmer, the Bengals agreed to trade the disgruntled quarterback. Raiders head coach Hue Jackson was previously the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at USC and helped recruit Palmer, and was also the Bengals wide receivers coach during the prime of Palmer&#x27;s career. Jackson&#x27;s good relationship with both Palmer and the Bengals organization was key to the deal. In exchange for a player whom the Bengals did not need and who stated he&#x27;d never suit up for them again, the Bengals received Oakland&#x27;s first-round pick in the 2012 draft and a conditional second-round pick in the 2013 draft, which became a first-round pick had the Raiders reached the AFC Championship game in 2011. Cincinnati later used the picks to select Alabama cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick in 2012 and North Carolina running back Gio Bernard in 2013. The trade was deemed one of the most one-sided trades in recent memory, and it was one of the factors that resulted in Jackson&#x27;s termination after the season. Dalton went on to lead the Bengals to the playoffs and was selected to the Pro Bowl, while Jackson was soon re-hired by the Bengals as an assistant coach. Palmer then signed a new four-year contract worth $43 million.

With punter Shane Lechler wearing Palmer&#x27;s number 9 from Cincinnati, Palmer switched his jersey number to 3, his number at USC which was worn by Jon Kitna in Cincinnati at the time the Bengals drafted him. On October 23, Palmer came off the bench against the Kansas City Chiefs to relieve starting quarterback Kyle Boller who had thrown 3 interceptions and had the team down 21–0. Palmer completed 8 of 21 passes for 116 yards and 3 interceptions in his Raider debut. He stated after the game, &quot;I was told I was not going to play. I didn&#x27;t know the offense, I also hadn&#x27;t been training and working out, so it was a complete shock to me at halftime when (Raiders coach Hue Jackson) told me, &#x27;Hey, you know we&#x27;re going to get you in, in the third quarter.&#x27;&quot; In his first start for the Raiders two weeks later, Palmer threw for over 330 yards and three touchdowns. He also threw three interceptions and lost a fumble.

In his second start as a Raider during the Week 11 Thursday Night game against the division rival San Diego Chargers, Palmer showed further progress as he finished the game completing 14 of 20 passes for 299 yards and threw two touchdowns and a single interception for a quarterback rating of 125.0 in a 24–17 road win that ultimately gave the Raiders the lead in the division. After going 0 for 2, Palmer completed 10 straight passes, including two touchdowns of 33 &amp; 26 yards to rookie wide receiver Denarius Moore. Palmer was on course for a perfect passer rating of 158.3 until he took a hit from Chargers&#x27; linebacker Travis LaBoy while attempting a pass early in the fourth quarter that resulted in wobbly pass picked-off by Paul Oliver.

The Raiders ended the season 8–8, 4–5 under Palmer. They lost the AFC West tiebreaker to the Denver Broncos and finished one game out of the playoffs.

====2012 season====

In 2012, the Palmer-led Raiders started the season 0–1 after a 22–14 home loss against the San Diego Chargers. Palmer had a good game statistically going 32 of 46 for 297 yards and a touchdown. In Week 2, Palmer completed 24 of 48 (50%) passes for 373 yards and a touchdown, but also an interception in a 35–13 loss to the Miami Dolphins. The Raiders returned home for a Week 3 matchup against their longtime historic rival Pittsburgh Steelers. Sitting at 0–2, Palmer drove the Raiders down the field in the final seconds to set up a field goal attempt for the Raiders to win. Palmer went near perfect in his pass attempts completing 24 of 34 for 3 touchdowns and an interception in the 34–31 win. In Week 4 however, Palmer struggled against the Denver Broncos going 19 of 34 for 202 yards in a 37–6 road loss. The Raiders went into their bye week with Palmer&#x27;s stats standing at 99 of 162 pass attempts for 1,081 yards, 5 touchdowns, 2 interceptions. The Raiders (who had finished 4–5 with Palmer as a starter) had also gone 5–8 with Palmer at the starting quarterback helm by this time. Returning from the bye week, Palmer and the Raiders traveled down south to face the Atlanta Falcons who were undefeated against AFC opponents. The Raiders got off to a good start with Palmer looking very sharp with 23 of 33 for 353 yards and a touchdown, but he also threw an interception as the Falcons completed the comeback drive to win 23–20. Palmer went 26 of 46 for 298 yards, a touchdown, an interception, and also a rushing touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars a week later. Palmer stayed sharp through the next game at Kansas City against the Chiefs, going 14 of 28 for 209 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception in a 26–16 win. A week later, the Raiders returned home for a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite the fact that Palmer went 39 of 61 for 414 yards and 4 touchdowns, the struggling quarterback also threw 3 costly interceptions in the 42–32 loss. A week later at Baltimore, Palmer still looked sharp in the 55–20 road loss to the Baltimore Ravens going 29 of 45 for 368 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception. In Week 11, the Raiders returned home for a game against a struggling defensive New Orleans Saints team. However, despite the fact that Palmer and the Raiders&#x27; offense struggled, the quarterback went 22 of 40 for 312 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions in the huge 38–17 loss. In Week 12, Palmer returned to Cincinnati to face off against his former team the Cincinnati Bengals. Palmer struggled in this game going 19 of 34 for a season-low 146 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in a 34–10 loss. In Week 13, the Raiders returned home for a game against the Cleveland Browns. Coming into this game at 1–2 against the AFC North, the Raiders were down by 3, but ended up losing 20–17 to the Browns despite the fact that Palmer was 34 of 54 for 351 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception. In Week 14, the Raiders stayed home for a Thursday Night Football game against the Denver Broncos. The Raiders lost 26–13 in spite of Palmer going 19 of 30 for 273 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception. This game was his 9th straight game with at least 1 interception. In Week 15, the Raiders stayed home for the 3rd straight week for game 2 against the division rival Kansas City Chiefs, in which they won 15–0, with Palmer&#x27;s streak of games with at least 1 interception coming to an end, but he still struggled as he went 18 of 29 for 182 yards. In Week 16, Palmer and the Raiders traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, to take on the Carolina Panthers. Palmer early in the game suffered a further injury of his ribs, leaving him out for the rest of the game. As he went 3 of 3 for 31 yards in the game, quarterback Matt Leinart took over for the rest of the game. The Raiders, however, went on to lose by a score of 17–6. Out of the 14 games Palmer started and completed that year, the Raiders went 4–11 with him, bringing his total to 8–15 as the teams&#x27; starting quarterback.

===Arizona Cardinals===

====2013 season====

Palmer was officially traded to the Arizona Cardinals on April 2, 2013, for a 2013 sixth round draft pick and a conditional pick in the 2014 NFL draft. He then signed a two-year restructured contract worth $16 million. His coach was Bruce Arians, the former Colts interim coach, who had led the Indianapolis Colts while Chuck Pagano was recovering from cancer treatment. While having a rusty 3–4 start, Palmer led the Cardinals to a 10–6 record his first year but was eliminated from playoff contention in week 17. Palmer ranked 8th in the NFL in passing yards with 4,274 yards, the most of his career. He also became the first player in NFL history to top 4,000 yards passing for three different teams. During week 11, he was nominated for FedEx Air Player of the Week with 419 yards and two touchdowns. This win over the Jacksonville Jaguars ended Carson Palmer&#x27;s interception streak through the first 9 games of his season (not including the bye week). During Week 14, Palmer hit a career high with an 84.4 completion percentage when he went 27 for 32 with 269 yards and a touchdown in a 30–10 win over the St. Louis Rams. During Week 16, while he threw four interceptions, two to Richard Sherman, he was able to rally the Cardinals to a 17–10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, who had a perfect home record for the last two years.

====2014 season====


In Week 1 against the San Diego Chargers, Palmer threw two touchdowns late in the game to win in an upset. In the same game, Palmer ran for a career-high 30 yards and got injured running for a first down. Instead of avoiding safety Eric Weddle, Palmer collided with him. He missed the next three games, in which backup Drew Stanton won against the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers and lost to the Denver Broncos. Upon his return the Cardinals went on to win five games in a row and remain the top seed in the NFC, with Palmer throwing 11 touchdowns to just 3 interceptions. On November 7, 2014, Palmer agreed to a three-year, $49.5 million contract extension with the Cardinals. On November 9, 2014, Palmer re-tore his ACL in a game against the St. Louis Rams. He was placed on the injured reserve list the next day, ending his season. Palmer underwent surgery in which doctors removed the donated Achilles tendon from his knee and replaced it with his own patellar tendon for reconstruction. The Cardinals went on to start Stanton for the remainder of the season until he too suffered a knee injury against the Rams in December. The Cardinals then started Ryan Lindley for the remainder of the season. The Cardinals finished 11–5 and went into the playoffs as a Wild Card, but lost to the Carolina Panthers in the first round, mustering only 78 yards of total offense while missing their starting and backup quarterback, starting and backup running back, starting left outside linebacker, and starting middle linebacker due to injury or suspension.

====2015 season====

Palmer engineered what many considered his best season by recording 35 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, and was 13–3 as a starter through the 2015 season, winning the NFC West and securing the Cardinals&#x27; first first-round bye in the playoffs. Many in the sports world considered Palmer a candidate for the NFL&#x27;s 2015 MVP award, along with Tom Brady, Russell Wilson, and eventual winner Cam Newton. Palmer was also elected to his third Pro Bowl. In Week 10, towards the end of a 39–32 win over the division rival Seattle Seahawks, Palmer made a crotch chop gesture to the Seattle fans; he pumped his fist twice and followed it up by pointing at his crotch. Later in the week, he was fined $11,576 for the action. Palmer set a franchise record with the Cardinals against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 14, throwing his 31st touchdown, passing Kurt Warner. In the same game, the Cardinals clinched a playoff berth. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles the following week, he and the Cardinals clinched the NFC West. In Week 16 against the Packers, Palmer and the Cardinals secured a first round bye in the playoffs by clinching the 2nd seed in the NFC, behind only the 15–1 Panthers. In 16 starts, Palmer threw for a franchise record 4,671 yards with 35 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Round, Palmer completed 25 of 41 passes for 349 yards, 3 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions in the Cardinals&#x27; 26–20 overtime win in a Week 16 rematch against the Green Bay Packers, earning his first, and only, career playoff win in the process. The Cardinals lost the NFC Championship game 49–15 to the Carolina Panthers, a game where Palmer threw four interceptions and lost two fumbles. Palmer lost the MVP award to Newton, who received 48 out of 50 votes while Palmer and Brady received one vote each. He was ranked 12th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.

====2016 season====

On August 5, 2016, Palmer signed a one-year, $24.35 million contract extension with the Cardinals. He started 15 games in 2016 and missed Week 5 against the San Francisco 49ers after suffering a concussion the previous week against the Los Angeles Rams. Palmer threw for over 4,000 yards for the sixth time in his career and finished the season with 4,233 yards, 26 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. However, the Cardinals missed the playoffs with a 7–8–1 record.

====2017 season====

On September 17, 2017, in Week 2, Palmer passed for 332 yards, one touchdown, and one interception in the 16–13 overtime victory over the Indianapolis Colts. During Week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams at Twickenham Stadium, Palmer had 122 passing yards and an interception until leaving the game with a left arm injury. The Cardinals were shut out 33–0.

==Post-playing career==
Following his retirement, Palmer became an advocate for cannabidiol. He partnered with CBD-based liniment maker Level Select in late 2019.

In 2024, Palmer returned to Santa Margarita as a volunteer coach for the freshman team, on which his son Fletch was the starting quarterback. At the end of the season, the school appointed him as head coach of the varsity team.

==Personal life==
On July 5, 2003, Palmer wed former USC soccer player, Shaelyn Fernandes, whom he met during freshman orientation. They currently reside in Sun Valley, Idaho. His brother, Jordan Palmer, was his best man at the wedding. Palmer and his wife have four children together: twins Fletch and Elle, Bries, and Carter.

Not counting endorsement deals Palmer earned over $174 million during his NFL career. In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Palmer&#x27;s annual income was $29 million. He and his wife pledged to make a challenge gift of $300,000 for Compassion International&#x27;s &quot;Fill the Stadium&quot; initiative.

Following his first reconstructed knee surgery and learning that the tendon used for his knee came from a cadaver, Palmer had his wife drive him to the local Department of Motor Vehicles to have his driver&#x27;s license updated to make him an organ donor as gratitude to the family who donated the tendon to him. Coincidentally, the teammate who caught his pass when he first injured his knee, Chris Henry, also donated several organs following his death in a 2009 auto accident.

<text>To Live and Die in L.A. is a 1985 American neo-noir crime thriller film directed and co-written by William Friedkin. It is based on the 1984 novel of the same name by former U.S. Secret Service agent Gerald Petievich, who co-wrote the screenplay with Friedkin. It stars William Petersen, Willem Dafoe, John Pankow, John Turturro, Darlanne Fluegel and Dean Stockwell. Wang Chung composed and performed the original music soundtrack. The film tells the story of the lengths to which two Secret Service agents go to arrest a counterfeiter.

The film was released by MGM/UA Entertainment Co. on November 1, 1985. It received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its authenticity and the cinematography by Robby Müller. It was a financial success, grossing $17.3 million from $6 million budget.

William Friedkin referred to the film as one of his favorites of his own works. In 2008, the film was voted by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; staff as one of the best films set in Los Angeles in the previous 25 years.

==Plot==

After foiling an assassination attempt by an Islamic jihadist on President Reagan, Secret Service agents Richard Chance and Jimmy Hart are assigned as counterfeiting investigators in the Los Angeles field office. Days away from retirement, Hart stakes out a warehouse in the desert used by artist-turned-counterfeiter Eric &quot;Rick&quot; Masters, and is killed by Masters and his bodyguard, Jack. Chance, who has earned a reputation for impulsive behavior, vows to his new partner, John Vukovich, that he will take Masters down by any means necessary.

Chance and Vukovich arrest Masters&#x27; mule Carl Cody after he makes a delivery to attorney Max Waxman, who lies to Masters that he never received the money. The agents place Waxman under surveillance, but he is betrayed by Masters&#x27; girlfriend Bianca and murdered by Masters. The by-the-book Vukovich is uncomfortable with Chance&#x27;s increasingly reckless and unethical tactics, while Chance relies on his sexual-extortion relationship with Ruth, an informant on parole whom he threatens to send back to prison.

When Masters attempts to have Cody killed in prison, Chance arranges for his supervised release, but Cody escapes. Vukovich convinces Masters&#x27; attorney Bob Grimes to arrange a meeting between his client and the two agents, who pose as offshore bankers from Palm Springs seeking $1 million in fake bills. Masters demands $30,000 in front money, which the agency refuses to authorize. Desperate to entrap Masters, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, a man Ruth learned will be carrying $50,000 to purchase stolen diamonds.

They intercept Ling at Union Station and seize the cash at gunpoint under the Sixth Street Viaduct, but are followed by his associates who open fire, accidentally killing Ling. After a panicked car chase, Chance and Vukovich finally escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. Their next daily briefing reveals that Ling was an undercover FBI agent, but Chance remains determined to avenge Hart and continues their plan, paying Masters and arranging the $1 million exchange. Consumed by guilt, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner, who recaptures Cody.

The two agents meet with Masters and Jack for the exchange, and attempt to arrest them, but Jack and Chance fatally shoot each other as Masters escapes. Vukovich pursues Masters to his warehouse workshop, where he is burning all evidence of his crimes. Masters asks why Vukovich did not take Grimes&#x27; advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters&#x27; behalf all along. Subduing Vukovich, Masters covers him with shredded bills to set him on fire, but Vukovich awakens and shoots Masters repeatedly as the counterfeiter burns alive.

Packing up to leave Los Angeles, Ruth is confronted by Vukovich, now dressed much like Chance. She defends her right to keep the remaining $20,000 Chance left her, but Vukovich suggests that she knew Ling was an FBI agent and set Chance up. Embracing Chance&#x27;s willingness to do &quot;whatever it takes&quot;, and assuming his control of Ruth&#x27;s life, Vukovich declares that she now works for him.

==Cast==

==Production==
Director William Friedkin was given Gerald Petievich&#x27;s novel in manuscript form and found it very authentic. The filmmaker was also fascinated by the &quot;absolutely surrealistic nature&quot; of the job of a Secret Service agent outside Washington, D.C. When the film deal was announced, Petievich was investigated by a rival for a pending office promotion, and felt &quot;a lot of resentment against me for making the movie&quot; and &quot;some animosity against me in the Secret Service&quot; existed, exacerbated by the agent in the Los Angeles field office who suddenly resigned a few weeks after initiating the investigation. SLM Production Group, a tribunal of financiers, worked with Friedkin on a ten-picture, $100 million deal with 20th Century Fox but when the studio was purchased by Rupert Murdoch, one of the financiers pulled the deal and took it to MGM.

===Casting===
Friedkin had a $6 million budget to work with while the cast and crew worked for relatively low salaries. As a result, he realized that the film would have no movie stars in it. William Petersen was acting in Canada when asked to fly to New York City and meet with the director. Half a page into his reading, Friedkin told him he had the part. The actor was drawn to the character of Chance as someone who had a badge and a gun and how it not only made him above the law, but also &quot;above life and death in his head&quot;. The actor found the experience of being this character and making the film &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;intoxicating&quot;. He called fellow Chicago actor John Pankow and brought him to Friedkin&#x27;s apartment the day after being cast as Chance, recommending him for the role of Vukovich. The director agreed on the spot.

In addition, Gerald Petievichauthor of the source novel and, at that time, in his final weeks as a Secret Service agentalong with his then-LAPD brother John and their then-retired LAPD father Zarko, were cast in brief cameos as agents.

===Screenplay===
The basic plot, characters, and much of the dialogue of the film is drawn from Petievich&#x27;s novel, but Friedkin added the opening terrorist sequence, the car chase, and clearer, earlier focus on the showdown between Chance and Masters. Petievich said that Friedkin wrote a number of scenes but when there was a new scene or a story needing to be changed, that he, Petievich, wrote it. The director admits that Petievich created the characters and situations and that he used a lot of dialogue but that he wrote the screenplay, not Petievich.

===Principal photography===
The director wanted to make an independent film and collaborate with people who could work fast, like cinematographer Robby Müller and his handpicked crew who were non-union members. Friedkin shot everything on location and worked quickly, often using the first take to give a sense of immediacy. He did not like to rehearse but would create situations where the actors thought they were rehearsing a scene when actually they were shooting a take. Friedkin did this just in case he got something he could use. To this end, he let scenes play out and allowed the actors to stay in character and improvise. For example, during the scene where Chance visits Ruthie at the bar where she works, Friedkin allowed Petersen and actress Darlanne Fluegel to devise their own blocking and told Müller, &quot;Just shoot them. Try and keep them in the frame. If they&#x27;re not in the frame, they&#x27;re not in the movie. That&#x27;s their problem.&quot;

The shot of Petersen running along the top of the dividers between the terminal&#x27;s moving sidewalk at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police. The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen&#x27;s safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he hurt himself. The actor told Friedkin that they should do the stunt anyway so the director proposed that they treat it like a rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials.

The counterfeiting montage looks authentic because Friedkin consulted actual counterfeiters who had done time. The &quot;consultant&quot; actually did the scenes that do not show actor Willem Dafoe on camera to give this sequence more authenticity even though the actor learned how to print money. Over one million dollars of counterfeit money was produced but with three deliberate errors so that it could not be used outside the film. The filmmakers burned most of the fake money but some leaked out, was used, and linked back to the production. The son of one of the crew members tried to use some of the prop money to buy candy at a local store and was caught. Three FBI agents from Washington, D.C. interviewed 12–15 crew members including Friedkin, who screened the workprint for them. He offered to show the film to the Secretary of the Treasury and take out anything that was a danger to national security. That was the last he heard from the government.

The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway sequence was one of the last things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped-down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in &quot;The French Connection&quot; then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow&#x27;s stressed-out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.

Adding to the chaotic feeling of the chase, Friedkin staged it so that the freeway traffic flow was reversed. That is that the normal traffic in the scene has the drivers driving on their left in the left hand lanes (as in Britain) while the cars driving against the flow were driving on their right (as would be usual in North America).

In reference to a sex sequence between William Petersen and Darlanne Fluegel, director William Friedkin revealed to have told the actors to &quot;make it as real as possible. Make it real&quot;.

===Post-production===
As early as the day he cast Petersen, Friedkin thought about killing off Chance towards the end of the film, but according to editor Bud Smith, Vukovich was supposed to be the one who was killed. The climactic scene in which Chance is killed was not very well received by MGM executives, who found it to be too negative. To satisfy the studio heads, he shot a second ending, in which Chance survives the shotgun blast and, presumably as an internal punishment, he and Vukovich are transferred to a remote Secret Service station in Alaska, and watch their boss Thomas Bateman being interviewed on television. Friedkin previewed the alternate ending and kept the original.

==Reception==
===Box-office===
In the United States and Canada, &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; grossed $17.3million, against a production budget of $6million. Released November 1, 1985, it opened at No. 2 and spent six consecutive weeks in the Top 10 at the domestic box office.

===Critical response===

Roger Ebert, film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film four out of four stars and wrote that &quot;the movie is also first-rate. The direction is the key. Friedkin has made some good movies ... and some bad ones. This is his comeback, showing the depth and skill of the early pictures&quot;. He went on to praise Petersen, &quot;a Chicago stage actor who comes across as tough, wiry and smart. He has some of the qualities of a Steve McQueen&quot;.

Critic Janet Maslin was dismissive of the film, and wrote &quot;Today, in the dazzling, superficial style that Mr. Friedkin has so thoroughly mastered, it&#x27;s the car chases and shootouts and eye-catching settings that are truly the heart of the matter&quot;.

David Ansen, critic for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, wrote &quot;Shot with gritty flamboyance by Robby Muller, cast with a fine eye for fresh, tough-guy faces, &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; may be fake savage, but it&#x27;s fun&quot;.

The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a mixed review and wrote that it was over the top: &quot;[E]ngrossing and diverting enough on a moment-to-moment basis but is overtooled ... what conversation there is proves wildly overloaded with streetwise obscenities, so much so that it becomes something of a joke&quot;.

In his scathing review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Paul Attanasio predicted that it would fail at the box office, writing that it would &quot;live briefly and die quickly in L.A., where God hath no wrath like a studio executive with bad grosses... [it is]... overheated and recklessly violent&quot;, dismissing it with sarcasm as not even living up to the &quot;high standard established by &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;&quot;.

Movie historian Leonard Maltin seemed to agree with Attanasio, giving the film 1.5 stars out of a possible four: &quot;This picture is so gritty that it&#x27;s hard to root for anybody... For a crack Secret Service agent and a master counterfeiter, both Dafoe and Petersen act pretty dumb...&quot;, adding that the terrific car chases and the Wang Chung music score were &quot;not enough to counteract the bad taste this film leaves behind.&quot;

Jay Scott, in his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, wrote &quot;Pity poor Los Angeles: first the San Andreas fault and now this. The thing about it is, &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;, for all its amorality and downright immorality, is a cracker-jack thriller, tense and exciting and unpredictable, and more grimy fun than any moralist will want it to be&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; criticized its &quot;brutal, bloated car-chase sequence pilfered from Friedkin&#x27;s nifty &quot;The French Connection&quot;&quot;, and called it &quot;a fetid movie hybrid: Miami Vile&quot;.

Almost two decades later, a review in &quot;The Digital Fix&quot; called the film &quot;A sun-bleached study in corruption and soul-destroying brutality, this film by the notoriously erratic but sometimes brilliant William Friedkin is nasty, cynical and incredibly good.&quot; The film was voted as the 19th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors with two criteria: &quot;The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list&quot;.

William Friedkin singled out the movie as one of his favorite movies: &quot;I love the film, and I value my films or don’t value them in a different way. When I think of them in terms of success, I think of how close I came to my original vision of it. The two films where I came extremely close were &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot;.

===Accolades===
Wins
* Cognac Festival du Film Policier: Audience Award; William Friedkin; 1986.
* Stuntman Awards: Stuntman Award; Best Feature Film Vehicular Stunt, Dick Ziker and Eddy Donno; Most Feature Film Spectacular Sequence, Dick Ziker; 1986.

===Impact===
Although criticized at the time for the lack of accomplished celebrities in its cast, many of the actors have become established stars, most notably Willem Dafoe, William Petersen, John Pankow, Jane Leeves, and John Turturro.

==Soundtrack==

According to Friedkin, the main reason he chose Wang Chung to compose the soundtrack was because the band &quot;stands out from the rest of contemporary music ... What they finally recorded has not only enhanced the film, it has given it a deeper, more powerful dimension&quot;. He wanted them to compose the score for his film after listening to the band&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;Points on the Curve&quot; (1984). He was so taken with the album that he took one of the songs straight off the album, &quot;Wait&quot;, and used it as part of the soundtrack. &quot;Wait&quot; plays at the end credits of the film. Every song on the soundtrack, excluding the title song and &quot;Wait&quot;, was written and recorded within a two-week period. Only after Wang Chung saw a rough cut of the film did they produce the title song.

An original motion picture soundtrack was released on September 30, 1985, by Geffen Records. The album contained eight tracks. The album&#x27;s title song, &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;, (with a music video also directed by Friedkin), made it on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 where it peaked at #41 in the United States.

==Home media==
A DVD was released by MGM Home Entertainment on December 2, 2003. The DVD contains a new restored wide-screen transfer, an audio commentary featuring director Friedkin where he relates stories about the making of the movie, a half-hour documentary featuring the main characters, a deleted scene showing a distraught Vukovich bothering his soon-to-be ex-wife at her apartment, and the alternate ending Friedkin refused to use, in which the two Secret Service partners survive but are transferred to Alaska while their supervisor Bateman is promoted and takes credit for stopping Masters. On February 2, 2010, the film was released on Blu-ray not containing all of the previous special features that were included on the DVD release.

On November 21, 2016, Arrow Video released a Region B Blu-ray edition with the old features and new features with the composer, stunt co-ordinator, William Petersen, Debra Feuer and Dwier Brown. On November 22, 2016, Shout! Factory released a Collector&#x27;s Edition, restoring the original DVD&#x27;s special features and adding new ones. Kino Lorber released the movie on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-Ray on July 18, 2023.

==Car chase==
The car chase featured in the film has consistently been ranked among the best car chase sequences on film, often appearing alongside &quot;The French Connection&quot; (another Friedkin directed film), &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot;, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;Ronin&quot; and &quot;Bullitt&quot;.

==Proposed television series==
In 2015, William Friedkin announced plans to develop a TV series based on the movie for WGN America.

<doc id="963053" wikidata="Q1329618" url="?curid=963053" title="Eliot Engel">
<text>Eliot Lance Engel (; born February 18, 1947) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from New York from 1989 to 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented a district covering portions of the north Bronx and southern Westchester County.

Engel won his first congressional election in 1988, defeating Mario Biaggi in the Democratic primary. In 2019, following Democratic gains in the 2018 elections, Engel was named chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; he previously was its ranking member from 2013. In 2020, after 16 terms in office, Engel was defeated in the Democratic primary by middle school principal Jamaal Bowman.

==Early life and education==
Engel was born in the Bronx, the son of Sylvia (née Bleend) and Philip Engel, an ironworker. His grandparents, of Ukrainian Jewish background, were immigrants from the Russian Empire. 

In 1969, Engel graduated from the Bronx campus of Hunter College with a Bachelor of Arts in history. He subsequently received a Master of Science in guidance and counseling in 1973 from the same institution, by now renamed Lehman College following the severance of its relationship with Hunter College. In February 1987, he earned a Juris Doctor from New York Law School.

== Early career ==
===New York State Assembly===
In 1977, Engel entered the special election for a seat in the New York State Assembly after the incumbent Democrat Alan Hochberg was forced to resign. He was the Liberal Party nominee in the special election, and on March 1, 1977, he won by 103 votes, defeating Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel.

Engel was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 1988, sitting in the 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, and 187th New York State Legislatures. He chaired the Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, and the Subcommittee on the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 1988, Engel ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York&#x27;s 19th congressional district. His state assembly district covered much of the congressional district&#x27;s southeastern corner. He defeated ten-term Rep. Mario Biaggi in the Democratic primary with 48% of the vote; Biaggi had resigned his seat and did not campaign for office, though his name remained on the ballot. Biaggi had been charged by Rudy Giuliani with racketeering in the Wedtech scandal, and was eventually jailed. Biaggi was unopposed for the Republican nomination (he had run on both the Republican and Democratic lines since 1972). Engel won the general election with 56% of the vote.

In 1994, Engel defeated musician Willie Colón 62%-38%. In 2000, Engel defeated State Senator Larry Seabrook, who had the support of Bronx County Democratic Party Chairman Roberto Ramirez, 50%-41%.

In 2020, Engel was challenged in the primary by Yonkers school principal Jamaal Bowman, who ran well to Engel&#x27;s left. Engel initially received an endorsement from New York State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, Mario Biaggi&#x27;s granddaughter. However, in early June, after a hot mic gaffe by Engel, where he insisted on speaking at a press conference and said, &quot;If I didn&#x27;t have a primary, I wouldn&#x27;t care,&quot; Biaggi withdrew her support of Engel and instead endorsed Bowman. In a mid-June poll, Engel trailed Bowman by ten percentage points and, after the election, with early and election day votes counted, Bowman led Engel by almost 12,000 votes, 61.8% to 34.9%. Absentee ballots were scheduled to be counted on June 30, 2020, though some sources called the race for Bowman before the counting of absentee ballots. After the absentee ballots were counted, Bowman&#x27;s lead was 55.4%-40.6%, or 13,218 votes. The race was called for Bowman on July 17, 2020, with the New York State Board of Elections certifying the results on August 6, 2020.

===Attendance at the State of the Union address===

Engel could be seen shaking hands with the President at a number of televised State of the Union addresses during his time in Congress. Along with other Members of Congress, Engel showed up at the Capitol early in order to guarantee that he would get an aisle seat. Engel managed to shake hands with the President at every address, and be seen by his constituents on live television, starting when he arrived in Congress in 1989. He expressed that, &quot;It&#x27;s an honor to shake the hand of the president of the United States no matter who it is.&quot;

This tradition ended in 2017 when Engel decided not to shake then President Donald Trump&#x27;s hand.

==Political positions==

===Healthcare reform===
A strong supporter of single payer healthcare, Engel supported quality access to health care, and referred to himself as pro-choice &quot;all the way&quot;. Engel was a co-sponsor of the United States National Health Care Act, which would implement a single-payer health care system in the United States. In 2010 he was a strong supporter of the landmark Affordable Care Act once he secured provisions that New York would not be penalized for providing more generous benefits than other states.

In 2008, Engel authored the ALS Registry Act (P.L. 110–373), which established a national registry for the collection and storage of data on those suffering from ALS. He also authored the Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Act (P.L. 110–361), which promoted research at Centers of Excellence for Muscular Dystrophy.

In 2010, Engel wrote the Partnering to Improve Maternity Care Quality Act to improve maternity care for mothers and newborns, and to do so in partnership with doctors, advocates, payers, and purchasers. In 2010 he also wrote the Gestational Diabetes Act of 2010, which passed the House, but didn&#x27;t come to a vote in the Senate. In 2018, he reintroduced the legislation in the 115th Congress for consideration. It was not voted on. The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which, if untreated, could lead to Type 2 diabetes for both mother and child.

===Global health===
Engel supported an improved re-authorization of the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Within the PEPFAR bill, Engel included his bill, the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act. This measure would provide increased U.S. support for international Tuberculosis control activities, and promotes research to develop new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.

===Energy===
In 2005, Engel, along with Congressman Jack Kingston (R-GA), introduced the Fuel Choices for American Security Act (H.R. 4409), later modified and re-introduced in 2007 as the DRIVE Act (H.R. 670) - the Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act - with more than 80 bi-partisan co-sponsors. It was designed to promote America&#x27;s national security and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies. It also called for increased tire efficiency - to increase a vehicle&#x27;s gas miles.

Many provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the Energy Independence and Security Act, which was signed into law on December 19, 2007, and became Public Law No. 110-140. This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown biofuels like cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, and biobutanol.

Engel introduced the Open Fuel Standards Act, alongside Congressmen Kingston, Steve Israel (D-NY) and Bob Inglis (R-SC). This bill would have required 50 percent of new cars sold in the United States by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be flexible-fuel vehicles capable of running on any combination of ethanol, methanol, or gasoline. Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version.

Engel on the Energy and Commerce Committee and Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. He played a key role in negotiating the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454, which passed the House on June 26, 2009. That legislation was intended to revitalize the economy by creating millions of new jobs, increase American national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, and preserve the planet by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It passed the House in 2009, but was not voted on by the Senate in the 111th Congress.

===Gun control===
A supporter of gun control, Engel in Congress &quot;worked to ban assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and armor-piercing bullets, institute universal background checks, adopt extreme risk protection orders, and restore funding for gun violence research.&quot; He voted against a 2003 bill that immunized firearm manufacturers and dealers from civil liability for gun misuse, supports &quot;smart gun&quot; technology to prevent guns from being used by unauthorized persons, and voted against a bill to reduce the waiting period to purchase a gun at a gun show. In 2009, Engel was one of 53 members of Congress who signed a letter to President Barack Obama, urging the new president to resume enforcement of a ban on the import of foreign assault weapons (authorized by the Gun Control Act of 1968 and enforced during the administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton). In 2001, after 400,000 defective gun locks were recalled from the market, Engel introduced a bill intended to protect parents and children from faulty gun locks by instructing the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms.

===Other domestic issues===
On December 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Truth in Caller ID Act. The legislation was introduced by Bill Nelson in the Senate, passed the House on December 15, and is virtually identical to Engel&#x27;s bill. The new law cracks down on the use of caller ID spoofing, often used by criminals to trick their victims into giving out personal information. The legislation will help law enforcement combat identity theft.

Engel originally introduced the Securing our Borders and Our Data Act in July 2008, HR 6702. That bill would ensure that when a traveler enters the United States, a border agent cannot search or seize the traveler&#x27;s data or equipment without cause. The legislation was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as HR 239. The Department of Homeland Security altered their rules to prevent agents from searching and seizing without cause. This encompassed much of Engel&#x27;s legislation.

In the 109th Congress, Engel introduced the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act, HR 3402. The bill was intended to stop some of the massive fraud in the prepaid calling card industry. The legislation passed the House unanimously, but the Senate did not act on it. In 2011, Engel introduced the Drug Testing Integrity Act, which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests.

In 2010, Engel urged the Federal Housing Finance Agency to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on cooperative apartment sales. Some developers and investors had been abusing the system by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades. The transfer fee, when used correctly, can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable. The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.

In 2012, Engel introduced SNOPA, the Social Network Online Protection Act. It would guarantee online privacy and ensure that employers and educational institutions cannot use personal data as a bargaining chip for employment or education. Employers/schools would be barred from requesting or requiring usernames or passwords to social media sites as part of the hiring, employment, or enrollment process. The bill was re-introduced in the 113th Congress, with Rep. Michael Grimm as the Republican lead, and Rep. Jan Schakowsky as an original co-sponsor.

===International affairs===

Engel is a supporter of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and has also been an advocate for the causes of Albanian-Americans and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In 2003, he authored the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 12, 2003. In this Law, Congress authorized penalties and restrictions on US relations with Syria for its occupation of Lebanon, and for its relationship with terrorist groups. Syria withdrew all forces from Lebanon in 2005 after the Cedar Revolution.

In September 2020, Engel stated that &quot;the influence of external actors such as Turkey recklessly meddling&quot; in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is &quot;troubling&quot;.

====Western Hemisphere Subcommittee====
As Chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Engel called for stronger U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. His Subcommittee held hearings on issues such as the crisis in Haiti, poverty, and inequality in Latin America.

Engel pushed for increased funding for emergency relief in Haiti, and for Temporary Protective Status (TPS) of Haitian nationals in the U.S. Engel is also supportive of the &quot;Mérida Initiative&quot;, in which the U.S. is cooperating with Mexico, Central America, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti to counter narco-trafficking and related violence in the region. In the 110th United States Congress, he introduced the Social Investment and Economic Development Act for the Americas of 2007 (re-introduced in 2009, where it also died in committee) and sponsored the Western Hemisphere Energy Compact Act to develop partnerships to strengthen diplomatic relations with the Government of Brazil, and the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere (died in committee).

The bi-partisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009 (sponsored by Engel) was passed by the House on December 8, 2009; it would have taken a fresh look at the United States&#x27; counter-narcotics efforts, both at home and abroad. The bill did not pass the Senate.

====Middle East====

Engel was one of the leading congressional supporters of Israel. Although he supported resolutions critical of both Israelis and Palestinians, his criticisms of Israeli policies were usually couched as warnings of their harm to Israel itself. In 2008, he was the lead Democrat on a resolution condemning Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas and other Palestinian militant organizations. Shortly after entering Congress, he sponsored a resolution declaring Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel. A very pro-Israel position, this was contrary to official American policy until President Donald Trump adopted it in December 2019. He also wrote the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 12, 2003. This law authorized restrictions on American relations with Syria, and penalties for its occupation of Lebanon, and for its relationship with terrorist groups.

In 2016 Engel was one of only 16 Democrats to join with 200 Republicans and defeat a measure that would have banned the sale of cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia who is at war with Yemen. In November 2018 the CIA determined that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Engel told NPR that he did not want to see Salman “punished.”

In January 2017, Engel introduced a House resolution condemning the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.

====Kosovo and the Balkans====
The Albanian American Civic League, an Albanian American lobby group in Washington, D.C., added Engel to its lobby lineup of prominent politicians in the early 1990s. In 1996, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The Kosovo cause has been kept alive in Washington by a small group of congressmen led by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.)&quot; While a member of the Subcommittee on Europe and Chair of the Congressional Albanian Issues Caucus, Engel fought ethnic cleansing in the 1999 Kosovo War and voiced support in Congress for the unilateral 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence from Serbia. A street has been named after him in Pejë, and he was the first foreign dignitary to address the Kosovo parliament.

====Cyprus====
Engel called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus, and authored a resolution in 1996 calling for its demilitarization. His 1994 law allowed the United States Department of State to conduct an investigation of five Americans who disappeared during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and found the remains of one. Engel received the George Paraskevaides Award on May 17, 2007, given to those who have utilized ancient values to contribute to the nations and people of Cyprus and America and to the Hellenics in the modern world.

====Iraq War====
In 2002, although 133 members of the House of Representatives voted against it, Engel voted for the resolution granting President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq, as did the two Senators from New York, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton, and almost 300 members of the United States House of Representatives. After revelations that intelligence provided to Congress was partially unreliable, and the subsequent problems faced after Saddam Hussein was deposed, Engel has come to regret his decision to support the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and consistently votes in favor of gradual withdrawal. He has met with anti-war activists, and in 2008, he publicly called for the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

====Irish affairs====
In 2007, Engel became a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs. He supported the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and aided Irish nationals facing deportation from the United States. He has been a friend of Gerry Adams, former leader of Sinn Féin, and was the author of legislation that prohibits employers in Northern Ireland and Ireland from receiving U.S. funds from the International Fund for Ireland, unless they comply with fair employment and non-discrimination principles called the &quot;MacBride Principles&quot;. In 2010, Engel was instrumental in helping Joe Byrne return to the United States, after a bureaucratic problem left him detained in Ireland and separated from his family in Rockland County.

====Human rights====

As a member of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Engel supported Albanian Americans and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. He is co-author of the Harkin–Engel Protocol, along with Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), which addresses child labor in the cocoa fields of West Africa.

In early 2001, he wrote the House resolution condemning the Taliban for forcing Hindu citizens to wear distinguishing marks as reminiscent of the Nazis forcing Jews to wear a yellow Star of David. In 2008, he wrote a resolution commending the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Promote Racial and Ethnic Equality.

Engel sponsored a bill to support the Day of Silence, during which students vow to remain silent to bring attention to the harassment and discrimination faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in schools. That bill has been re-submitted in the 111th United States Congress. He also voted against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which allowed for states not to be required to recognize same-sex marriages in other states. In 2010, he voted in 2010 to repeal the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy, enabling homosexuals to serve openly in the U.S. military.

In 2018, Engel condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.

Engel urged the Trump administration to take a tougher line on China by imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in China&#x27;s northwestern Xinjiang region. In March 2019, the group of lawmakers led by Engel wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that read in part, &quot;This issue is bigger than just China. It is about demonstrating to strongmen globally that the world will hold them accountable for their actions.&quot;

In June 2020, Engel stated that Polish President Andrzej Duda and Poland&#x27;s nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party &quot;promote horrifying homophobic and anti-LGBTQ stereotypes and policies that run counter to the human rights and values that America should strive to uphold&quot;.

====Iran nuclear deal====
In August 2015, Engel announced that he would oppose the Iran nuclear deal in congress, saying that, &quot;The answers I&#x27;ve received simply don&#x27;t convince me that this deal will keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran&#x27;s hands, and may in fact strengthen Iran&#x27;s position as a destabilizing and destructive influence across the Middle East.&quot;

==Controversies==

In March 2009, the Associated Press reported that Engel had been taking an annual tax credit on his Potomac, Maryland, residence for at least 10 years (cumulatively receiving thousands of dollars in tax credits), despite the fact that the credit is reserved for people who declare Maryland their primary residence. Maryland officials revoked the tax credit. The matter was reviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which also looked into similar tax credits claimed by three other members of the House. The OCE eventually ended its review on Engel and two of the other members of Congress (Doris Matsui and Edolphus Towns) without recommending further investigation by the House Ethics Committee.

In 1988, publisher Christopher Hagedorn began targeting Engel with criticism in his Bronx weekly newspapers (the &quot;Bronx News&quot;, the &quot;Parkchester News&quot;, and the &quot;Co-op City News&quot;), when he alleged that Engel, when he was still an assemblyman, was behind a failed effort to evict the Co-op City News from its offices. In addition, Hagedorn later reprinted articles from other newspapers that contained criticism of Engel. Hagedorn also endorsed Engel&#x27;s Democratic opponents, including Larry Seabrook in 2000; however, this did not prevent Engel&#x27;s re-election to Congress.

Engel mostly ignored Hagedorn&#x27;s criticism and accusations. In 1995, however, his communications director, Greg Howard, told the &quot;Bronx Beat&quot; newspaper &quot;We don&#x27;t consider Mr. Hagedorn a legitimate journalist. He uses the paper as his own personal platform for whatever agenda he has. He chooses the paper to malign people with whom he has philosophical differences.&quot; In the last decade, Hagedorn&#x27;s newspapers have been mostly silent in regard to Engel.

In January 2020, he revealed that in a call after he was fired as Trump&#x27;s National Security Adviser, John Bolton &quot;suggested to [Engel] — unprompted — that the [Foreign Affairs Committee] look into the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.&quot;

In April 2020, Engel claimed he had visited his district and taken part in COVID-19 and healthcare related events, before confirming when challenged that he had not returned to New York since March.

In June 2020, Engel appeared at a press conference to address the unrest resulting from the murder of George Floyd. When Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr. indicated there was not enough time for Engel to address the press, Engel responded, &quot;If I didn&#x27;t have a primary, I wouldn&#x27;t care.&quot; Diaz immediately rebuked Engel, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re not politicizing. Everybody&#x27;s got a primary, you know?&quot;

==Grades and recognition==
Engel received the National Association of Public Hospitals Safety Net Award in 2007 primarily for the introduction of The Public and Teaching Hospital Preservation Act. Engel was presented with The AIDS Institute National HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Award in 2007 and is the 2008 Distinguished Community Health Superhero as deemed by the National Association of Community Health Centers.

He was honored in 2008 by the American Farm Bureau Federation and the New York Farm Bureau as a Friend of the Farm Bureau for his support of farm issues during the 110th United States Congress.

On November 11, 2011, the Municipality of Pejë, Kosovo, gave Engel the title of Honorary Citizen of Peje.

In July 2019, the highway section M9.1 between Gjakove, Kosovo and SH22 Fierzë, Albania passing through Bajram Curri, Albania was named Eliot Engel Drive by local authorities.

<text>The Alchymist&#x27;s Cat is a dark fantasy novel for children by British author Robin Jarvis. It is the first book in &quot;The Deptford Histories&quot; trilogy, a series of prequels to Jarvis&#x27;s &quot;Deptford Mice&quot; books. Set in 17th century London, it serves as a backstory for the original trilogy&#x27;s main antagonist, Jupiter. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1991 by Macdonald Young Books. In 2004, it was published in the United States by Chronicle Books as The Alchemist&#x27;s Cat.

==Synopsis==
In London in 1664, an orange tabby cat named Imelza encounters a black cat she comes to call Master Midnight. When asked his real name, he identifies himself only as Imp. Imelza is seduced by him, and he impregnates her that night.

Shortly after his entire family dies of smallpox, young Will Godwin of the town of Adcombe is invited to London by an uncle he has never met. He asks his neighbour, John Balker the miller, to accompany him there. Despite the older man&#x27;s misgivings and concerns for Will&#x27;s safety, he agrees to do so. Will&#x27;s first night in London is disastrous. He and Mr. Balker are told that Will&#x27;s uncle will meet them at a seedy tavern called the Sickle Moon, but he fails to show up. The miller becomes drunk and as Will is leading him from the establishment, the two are attacked by a pair of ruffians. They murder Mr. Balker, but before they can turn their attention to Will, a man appears and scares them away by a show of what seems to be magic. The man introduces himself to Will as an apothecary named Elias Theophrastus Spittle. He hides Will in his shop before convincing the gathering crowd outside that it was the lad who killed Mr. Balker. Will tries to protest, but Spittle says that it would be wiser for him to remain silent, lest he incur the wrath of the mob. Now a fugitive, Will has no choice but to become the apothecary&#x27;s servant to ensure his silence. Partly for disguise and partly to demean him, Spittle cuts the boy&#x27;s hair short. When Will attempts to climb the stairs to the apothecary&#x27;s private quarters, he is immediately shooed away and told never to go there again. Still, he is intrigued by the crimson-painted door. While Spittle is away, Will takes the opportunity to explore the upper floor, and finds a room filled with the paraphernalia of a wizard. The apothecary catches him and is about to severely punish him when Will offers his assistance in gathering whatever magical ingredients the man might need. Spittle is pacified, and when Will asks if he is a wizard, he says that though he has studied the black arts, he is an alchemist rather than any sort of magician. It is his goal to find the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.

One night, Spittle sends Will out to fetch the hair of a hanged man. He is successful but gets the attention of the night watchman. Forced to flee, he takes refuge in the graveyard of the church of St. Anne. Suddenly, a series of howls pierce the night, frightening off the pursuing night watchman. Will follows the source of the sound and finds Imelza, having given birth to a litter of kittens. She and her small family are half-dead with cold and starvation. Taking pity on them, Will carries them back to Spittle&#x27;s apothecary shop. In order to be allowed to keep them, Will persuades Spittle to make one of the cats his familiar. Spittle chooses Jupiter, a strong and healthy ginger tabby, whom he trains in the magic arts. However, Spittle hates the ugly black runt, and names him Leech out of spite. Spittle has no interest in the tortoiseshell female, whom Will calls Dab. Due to Spittle favouring his brother, Leech becomes murderously envious of him. Spittle takes Will and his new familiar to St. Anne&#x27;s cemetery to call forth the spirit of a wizard from the previous century, Magnus Augustus Zachaire, to aid him in his search for the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. Zachaire&#x27;s spirit does appear but is angry at being disturbed and wishes to return to his grave. Spittle, however, traps him in a bottle which he carries back to the shop. Unwilling to help Spittle before, the furious Zachaire now absolutely refuses to do so, but Spittle says he will not release him until he finds the Stone. Leech discovers Zachaire&#x27;s bottle and the two begin to secretly converse with each other. During these talks, Zachaire informs Leech that the latter cannot use any spells because Jupiter has already assumed the role of magic user in his family. The spirit also foresees a future where Jupiter will attain godhood as &quot;Lord of All&quot;, which infuriates Leech. However, if Jupiter were to die, his powers would pass to his brother.

The Bubonic plague begins and spreads throughout London. Although Imelza and Dab escape from Spittle, Imelza is beaten to death by a frightened mob blaming animals for the spread of the plague. Will&#x27;s friend Molly, working as a plague doctor, saves Dab from near death. When Dab returns home, Spittle takes her away and murders her in the night for an anatomical experiment. Leech is the only witness to Dab&#x27;s abduction but refused to help her due to her having called specifically for Jupiter&#x27;s aid rather than his. Jupiter and Leech battle over who is heir to the black arts. When Zachaire reveals to Spittle that he lengthened his lifespan through a magic potion called the Elixir of Life, Spittle puts his quest for the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone on hold in favour of recreating it instead. This potion renders the drinker essentially immortal save for two Achilles heels: fire and water. When Spittle succumbs to the plague and dies, Jupiter reveals his ability to talk to Will and the two finish the alchemist&#x27;s work on the Elixir of Life to resurrect him. It is at this point that Will learns that Spittle is in fact his uncle, who lured him to London to take his inheritance. Spittle tries to murder Will, and Jupiter is at first hesitant to stop him as he doesn&#x27;t want to betray his master. But when he discovers his sister Dab&#x27;s preserved corpse, he is filled with rage and drinks the potion himself, turning on Spittle. He has a magical duel with Spittle and a fire breaks out. Using the power of the Elixir of Life, Zachaire summons his skeleton from the grave and becomes human again. He and Spittle put aside their differences and are about to escape the burning shop when Zachaire suddenly changes his mind. Wanting to die once more, he drags Spittle into the fire with him. Leech betrays Jupiter and leaves him to burn to death, inheriting his brother&#x27;s magic powers. Leech then falls into the fire himself. Will escapes the burning capital city with Molly, who turns out to have been John Balker&#x27;s estranged daughter. The two of them make plans to return to Adcombe. Will reveals that he has rescued one of the cats, so terribly burned that it is impossible to tell which it is. Later, the cat is revealed to be Leech. Having drunk the Elixir of Life as well as a hair tonic that changes his sable fur to ginger, Leech convinces a rat once kept by Spittle to lead him to the sewers. Leech takes his brother&#x27;s name and title as his own: &quot;Jupiter, Lord of All&quot;.

==Background==
Jarvis chose the setting of &quot;The Alchymist&#x27;s Cat&quot; from reading the diaries of Samuel Pepys and said he &quot;spent ages revelling in the research. Plague and the Great Fire - I couldn&#x27;t wish for a better backdrop!&quot; He imagined the character Dr. Spittle to appear similar to comic actor Alastair Sim. However, when creating the first edition&#x27;s cover painting, Jarvis used his barber as a reference. He says the scene where Spittle cuts Will&#x27;s hair was included as a nod to him.

==Reception==
Sally Estes of &quot;Booklist&quot; called the novel a &quot;creepy, atmospheric horror tale&quot; and a &quot;vivid tale of treachery, cruelty, and sorcery, leavened only by Will&#x27;s innate goodness.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;a crackerjack creepfest&quot; and added that &quot;Jarvis&#x27;s florid, purple-tinged prose presents London--with her filthy alleys and crime-ridden alehouses, her overgrown cemeteries and plague-haunted streets--as a major player in the unfolding disaster. Meanwhile, ghastly revelations pile upon grisly tableaus as the plot hurtles towards a spectacular final conflagration amidst London&#x27;s Great Fire.&quot; Christine McGinty of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; said &quot;The book is filled with adventure, suspense, and a feeling of dread. However, parts of it move very slowly, particularly in the beginning. Still, Jarvis closes with an unexpected cliff-hanger that will have readers craving more books about Jupiter.&quot;

==Unproduced film adaptation==
In late 2004, Robin Jarvis announced on his website that a film adaptation of &quot;The Alchymist&#x27;s Cat&quot; was to be made the following year. The script would be written by Richard Carpenter. Jarvis found it a &quot;fantastically exciting prospect&quot; and added that &quot;the actors that are being mentioned in connection with it are the best around.&quot; However, no further updates were ever given about the project, and it can be assumed that it was ultimately scrapped for reasons unknown. Carpenter passed away in 2012.

<doc id="963059" wikidata="Q7177599" url="?curid=963059" title="Peter Warrick">
<text>Peter L. Warrick (born June 19, 1977) is an American former professional football player who played at the wide receiver position for six seasons in National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Florida State Seminoles, earning consensus All-American honors twice. He was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals with the fourth overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft and played professionally for the Bengals and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL and the Bloomington Extreme of the Indoor Football League (IFL).

==Early life==
Born in Bradenton, Florida, Warrick attended Southeast High School in Bradenton, where he competed in football, basketball and track. He played wide receiver as a junior and caught 36 passes for more than 600 yards and nine touchdowns. He played quarterback as a senior, rushing for 673 yards and 13 touchdowns while completing 49 of 96 passes for 1,109 yards and 13 touchdowns. He also returned four punts for touchdowns during his junior and senior seasons. Warrick served as team captain and led Southeast High to two consecutive state titles. He was a &quot;USA Today&quot; honorable mention, &quot;Parade&quot; All-American and first-team Class 5A all-state player. In basketball, he was named the player of the year for the state of Florida.

In track and field, Warrick was among the state&#x27;s top performers in the sprinting and jumping events. He was the state runner-up in the long jump as a junior, at 7.16 meters. He won two state 6-A titles in the long jump as a senior, recording a personal-best jump of 7.25 meters. He ran a career-best time of 10.59 seconds in the 100 meters at the regional 5-A state meet. He was chosen to the all-area first team in the 100m and long-jump events.

===Recruiting===
Considered by some as the nation&#x27;s best high school wide receiver, Warrick was, according to &quot;The National Recruiting Advisor&quot;, the No. 1 wide receiver and No. 7 player in the nation. He chose to attend Florida State University, declining scholarship offers from several other major programs.

==College career==
Warrick played for coach Bobby Bowden&#x27;s Florida State Seminoles football team from 1995 to 1999. He primarily played wide receiver and returned punts, leading Florida State to BCS National Championship Game appearances in 1998 and 1999. During the 1999 season, Florida State was the first team in college football history to rank first in the polls throughout the season and end with the number-one ranking in the country. Warrick was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and the MVP of the 2000 Sugar Bowl with more than 160 yards receiving and three touchdowns, including a 59-yard punt return. Warrick graduated from Florida State with a bachelor of science degree in political science in 1999.

===Dillard&#x27;s department-store incident===
In July 1998, Warrick was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, but the charges were later dropped.

On September 29, 1999, during his senior season at Florida State, Warrick and teammate Laveranues Coles went to Dillard&#x27;s in the Tallahassee Mall and bought $412.38 worth of clothing for $21.40—a discount so large that it is considered shoplifting under Florida law. An off-duty officer witnessed the purchase through a surveillance camera. Warrick, Coles and the clerk, Rachel Myrtil, were arrested for grand theft. On October 22, Warrick pled guilty to misdemeanor petit theft. His sentence included 30 hours of community service, which he fulfilled by collecting trash in Tallahassee in 10-hour shifts.

At the 1999 rivalry game between the Florida Gators and Florida State, Gators fans brought Dillard&#x27;s bags to Florida Field in order to mock Warrick. Florida State won the game, 30–23.

At the time of his arrest, Warrick was widely considered the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy with 36 catches for 508 yards and four touchdowns during the season. Following the arrest, Florida State suspended Warrick for two games, as school rules prevented him from playing while criminal charges were pending. The two-game suspension, along with the negative publicity that he received in the national media, ended any chance for Warrick to be awarded the Heisman Trophy. At season&#x27;s end, Warrick was not invited to the award presentation at the Downtown Athletic Club and finished sixth in the overall voting.

==Professional career==

=== 2000 NFL draft ===
Although Warrick had been projected as the first overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft, a disappointing 40-yard dash time under adverse conditions during a workout hurt his standing. The Dillard&#x27;s incident also lowered his stock for some NFL teams. However, he was selected fourth overall by the Cincinnati Bengals.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
In his first three seasons with the Bengals, Warrick never gained more than 667 receiving yards. In 2003, Warrick caught a career-high 79 passes for 819 yards and seven touchdowns while gaining 143 rushing yards and adding another 273 yards and a touchdown returning punts.

Warrick missed most of the 2004 season with an injury, and receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh, a seventh-round pick in the 2001 draft, replaced him at the #2 receiver spot and had the best season of his career. Warrick was released by the Bengals before the start of the 2005 season.

===Seattle Seahawks===
Warrick signed with the Seattle Seahawks. In his first season with Seattle, Warrick was used infrequently in the starting lineup. He finished the season with 11 catches for 180 yards, one carry for five yards and six punt returns for 29 yards. However, for most of the postseason and in Super Bowl XL, Warrick served as the team&#x27;s starting punt returner. His 12-yard punt return in the first quarter of the Super Bowl helped set up the Seahawks&#x27; first points of the game. He later had a 34-yard return that was negated by a penalty. He finished Super Bowl XL with four punt returns for 27 yards.

On September 2, 2006, Warrick was cut by the Seahawks after the preseason. The New York Giants gave him a workout on November 13, and the Bengals also did so later in the year, but both teams declined to offer him a contract.

===Las Vegas Gladiators===
On January 4, 2007, the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League signed Warrick. Per club policy, terms of the deals were not disclosed. Warrick did not report after the AFL&#x27;s first week, and he was placed on the &quot;refused to report&quot; list by the team. Warrick did not work out for any teams in 2007, although Miami, Carolina, Jacksonville and the New York Jets contacted Warrick&#x27;s agent about potential workouts.

===Montreal Alouettes===
In May 2008, Warrick was signed by the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. He was released on June 3.

===Bloomington Extreme===
In 2009, Warrick was signed by the Bloomington Extreme of the Indoor Football League. He only played for one season.

===Cincinnati Commandos===
In 2011, Warrick signed with the Cincinnati Commandos of the Continental Indoor Football League. He never played in a game for the Commandos.

<text>Marvin Roland Lewis Jr. (born September 23, 1958) is an American professional football coach. He recently served as the assistant head coach for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). Lewis was previously the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals for 16 seasons. He came to prominence as the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens from 1996 to 2001, whose defense in 2000 set the record for the fewest points allowed in a 16-game season and led the franchise to their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXV. This success resulted in Lewis being named the Bengals&#x27; head coach, where he served from 2003 to 2018.

Lewis&#x27;s head coaching tenure oversaw improved fortunes for the struggling Bengals and helped transform the team into postseason contenders. At the time of his hiring, the Bengals had not had a winning season or postseason appearance since 1990, and finished with a franchise-worst 2–14 record. By his third season, Lewis ended both droughts and led the Bengals to their first division title in 15 years. In total, he guided the Bengals to seven playoff appearances and four division titles, along with a franchise-best five consecutive postseason appearances from 2011 to 2015. He became the franchise&#x27;s winningest head coach and was named Coach of the Year in 2009, making him the first Bengals coach to receive the honor since team founder Paul Brown in 1970.

While credited with returning the Bengals to respectability, Lewis&#x27; reputation was affected by a lack of postseason success and he was ultimately unable to lead the team to a playoff win despite seven different postseason berths. His 131 regular season victories, 16 years as a head coach, and seven postseason losses are the most of NFL head coaches who have not won a playoff game.

==Early life==
Marvin Lewis was born in McDonald, Pennsylvania, a small town about twenty miles west of Pittsburgh. He started playing football at the age of 9 and played safety and quarterback for his team at Fort Cherry High School. He was on the wrestling team and played baseball in the summers.

He initially decided to walk on as a football player at Purdue University, but subsequently received a scholarship to attend Idaho State University. He primarily played linebacker. In 2001, he was inducted into Idaho State University&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. He was named Idaho State Alumni of the Year for 2012. Lewis received both his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physical education and a master&#x27;s degree in athletic administration from Idaho State.

==Coaching career==
===College===
Lewis began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Idaho State before becoming the team&#x27;s linebackers coach for four seasons (1981–1984). Idaho State won the NCAA Division I-AA Championship during his first year with the team.

Lewis was an assistant coach at Long Beach State University (1985–1986), the University of New Mexico (1987–1989), and the University of Pittsburgh (1990–1992).

===National Football League===
====Assistant coach====
Lewis had coaching internships with the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers before being hired as the linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1992. He was a member of the Steelers&#x27; staff when the team lost Super Bowl XXX to the Dallas Cowboys.

The newly relocated Baltimore Ravens (formerly the Cleveland Browns), hired Lewis as their defensive coordinator in 1996, a position that he held for six seasons (1996–2001). On January 28, 2001, the Ravens defeated the New York Giants 34–7 in Super Bowl XXXV thanks largely to a defense that allowed the fewest rushing yards (970) and the fewest points (165) in a 16-game regular season. &quot;If ever a man proved his worth as a future head coach, Marvin Lewis did it with this complete domination of the Giants in their 16 possessions: Punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, interception, punt, interception, interception, punt, interception, punt, punt, punt, end of game&quot;, wrote &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Michael Silver after the game.

Lewis was a prime candidate for several NFL head coaching jobs but was passed over each time. Most notably, he nearly became head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002. General manager Rich McKay was ready to formally offer the job to Lewis, and the Ravens actually held a going-away party for him. However, the team&#x27;s owners, the Glazer family, were unwilling to give the job to another defense-minded coach after firing Tony Dungy. Lewis was also a prime candidate for the Buffalo Bills coaching vacancy, but was passed over in favor of Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator Gregg Williams. Shortly afterward, Lewis was hired by the Washington Redskins as defensive coordinator and assistant head coach under Steve Spurrier.

====Head coach====
=====2003–2005=====
Lewis became the ninth coach in Cincinnati Bengals history on January 14, 2003, when he was hired to replace Dick LeBeau, who was fired after the worst season in franchise history in terms of win percentage, edging out Tom Coughlin and Mike Mularkey. Lewis also had interviews with the Buffalo Bills, the Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Cleveland Browns. Lewis also declined head coaching positions in the college ranks with the University of California, Berkeley and Michigan State University to continue pursuing his goal of becoming a head coach in the NFL.

A contending team in the mid-late 1970s through the 1980s, the Bengals had fallen on hard times in the 1990s and had had several head coaches. However, Lewis didn&#x27;t take long to return the Bengals to respectability with a nucleus of young players such as quarterback Carson Palmer, running back Rudi Johnson, receivers Chad Johnson and T. J. Houshmandzadeh, and defensive backs Tory James and Deltha O&#x27;Neal. After consecutive 8–8 seasons in 2003 and 2004, Lewis led the Bengals to an 11–5 record in 2005, their first winning season, first division title, and first playoff berth since 1990. However, the Bengals lost in the first round to their rival and eventual Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers with Steelers&#x27; Kimo von Oelhoffen rolling into Carson Palmer&#x27;s leg, forcing Palmer out of the game and requiring reconstructive surgery during the off season, as well as inspiring the &quot;Carson Palmer Rule&quot; change protecting quarterbacks looking to throw with both feet on the ground.

=====2006–2010=====
The Bengals dropped to 8–8 in 2006, a disappointing season in which they started out 8–5 and then lost their last three games of the season, any one of which could have gotten them into the playoffs with a win. Then they recorded two consecutive losing seasons, going 7–9 in 2007 and going 4–11–1 in 2008. But in 2009, Cincinnati recorded their second winning season under Lewis&#x27; tenure. This included wins in all six games against their AFC North opponents, marking the first time in franchise history they accomplished this feat. The Bengals finished the season 10–6, winning the AFC North title and earning only their second trip to the playoffs in 19 years. On January 9, 2010, The Bengals were defeated by the New York Jets 24–14 in the opening round of the playoffs. On January 16, 2010, Lewis was named the Associated Press 2009 NFL coach of the year, after the Bengals improved from a 4–11–1 record in 2008 to a 10–6 regular season record in 2009.

The Bengals slipped to a 4–12 record in 2010, the worst record of Lewis&#x27; Bengals coaching tenure and the first time that the team finished last in the AFC North with Lewis as their head coach.

=====2011–2015=====

On January 4, 2011, Lewis signed an extension with the Bengals. The off-season leading up to 2011 was a difficult time for the Bengals. The team lost three of their most productive players from the 2010 season, receivers Terrell Owens and Chad Ochocinco along with defensive back Johnathan Joseph, while quarterback Carson Palmer, the team&#x27;s starter since 2004, refused to play for the Bengals moving forward, leading to him being traded midway through the season.

However, with the aid of strong play from their first and second-round draft picks, receiver A. J. Green and quarterback Andy Dalton, the Bengals still managed to record their third winning season. Midway through 2011, Lewis won his 65th game with the Bengals, surpassing Sam Wyche as the winningest coach in Bengals history. By the halfway mark, the Bengals&#x27; record was 6–2, including a five-game winning streak. It was the first time the Bengals had won five consecutive games since 1988, when the team advanced to Super Bowl XXIII with Wyche as their coach. They finished the season 9–7 and made the playoffs as the #6 seed, where the Bengals lost to the Houston Texans in the wild card round.

On July 31, 2012, the Bengals gave Lewis a two-year contract extension through 2014. Cincinnati started 2012 with a 44–13 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens, the most lopsided opening day defeat in franchise history. But the team recovered and won their next three games. After defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 16, the Bengals again clinched the #6 seed in the AFC and eliminated the Steelers from playoff contention. This marked the first time the Bengals made the playoffs in consecutive seasons since 1982, ending the longest streak of failure to make consecutive playoff appearances among all 32 NFL teams. Cincinnati finished the season with a 10–6 record, including a franchise record 51 quarterback sacks. However, the season again concluded with a loss in the wild card round handed to them by the Houston Texans.

The 2013 season was one of the most successful in Lewis&#x27;s career as head coach. Cincinnati finished with an 11–5 record and won their third division title since 2005. They were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the 9–7 San Diego Chargers, a team they had beaten earlier in the season 20–13. It was the third consecutive season that ended in a wild card round playoff loss for Cincinnati.

By 2014, Lewis acquired considerable authority over football operations. Owner Mike Brown was still reckoned as the team&#x27;s de facto general manager and retains the final say on football matters, but ceded most authority over day-to-day personnel matters to Lewis.

In 2014, Lewis became the 37th coach in NFL history to record 100 regular season wins. The Bengals continued their playoff streak, posting a 10–5–1 record. They held the fifth seed in the AFC playoffs and drew the 11–5 Indianapolis Colts as their first-round opponent. In week 7, the Bengals had been shut out 27–0 in Indianapolis. They lost again 26–13, despite having a 13–10 lead at halftime. With the Bengals&#x27; defeat, Lewis tied Jim E. Mora for the most postseason losses as a head coach without a win. There was some speculation that Lewis&#x27;s head coaching job was on thin ice after a fourth consecutive first-round playoff exit, but on April 22, 2015, Lewis signed an extension with the Bengals through 2016.

Cincinnati started out the 2015 season with an 8–0 record, the best start in franchise history. The team finished the year 12–4, the best record of Lewis&#x27; head coaching tenure and marking only the third time the Bengals had ever recorded 12 wins. However, the team was eliminated in a first-round wild card game for the fifth straight year, this time against their divisional rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers. Leading 16–15 near the end of the fourth quarter, Lewis faced criticism for not keeping his players under control after penalties drawn by Vontaze Burfict and Adam Jones moved the Steelers into field goal range and allowed them to make a game-winning kick with eighteen seconds remaining. The defeat made Lewis the first NFL coach to lose seven postseason games without any wins and the Bengals the first NFL team to lose five straight playoff games in the opening round.

=====2016–2018=====
The 2016 and 2017 seasons marked a noted decline for the Bengals, who finished 6-9-1 in the former and 7–9 in the latter to fail to qualify the postseason for two consecutive seasons. The seasons marked Lewis&#x27; first losing records with the team since 2010 and first consecutive losing years since 2008, as well as the first losing seasons and missed playoff appearances after the acquisitions of quarterback Andy Dalton and wide receiver A. J. Green.

The losing seasons, combined with Lewis&#x27; winless playoff record and previous five consecutive first-round eliminations led to speculation towards his future in Cincinnati and the potential end of his coaching tenure. This speculation was fueled by a report during the 2017 season that said Lewis was planning to leave the Bengals after his contract expired at the end of the season to pursue other opportunities. Following the conclusion of the 2017 regular season, the report was disproved when Lewis signed a two-year contract extension. The extension was met with criticism from the media and Bengals fans due to his 0–7 playoff record and only winning 13 out of 32 games in the previous two seasons.

Despite the criticism towards Lewis&#x27; return, the Bengals had a strong start in 2018, leading the AFC North with a 4–1 record by Week 5 and holding a 5–3 record before their bye week. After the bye, the team suffered a collapse and lost five consecutive games. During the losing streak, Lewis assumed control of the defense when defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired. Afflicted by season-ending injuries to several players and a struggling defense that ranked last in yards allowed, the Bengals finished the year with a 6–10 record to place at the bottom of their division. The season marked the first time since 2008 that the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in three consecutive years and the first time that Lewis had three consecutive seasons with sub-.500 records.

With a year left on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals announced that they had mutually parted ways following the conclusion of the 2018 season on December 31. Lewis finished as the first Bengals head coach to leave the team with an overall winning record since Bill Johnson in 1978.

===Return to college===
Lewis was hired as a special advisor at Arizona State University on May 28, 2019. On February 4, 2020, he was promoted to co-defensive coordinator alongside Antonio Pierce.

===Return to the NFL===
On February 1, 2024, Lewis was announced as the assistant head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders under Antonio Pierce after informally advising Pierce after Pierce became the interim head coach of the Raiders in 2023.

==Head coaching record==
==Broadcasting career==
After his departure from the Bengals, Lewis was hired as a game and studio analyst for Turner Sports&#x27;s coverage of the Alliance of American Football (AAF).

==Personal life==
Lewis is married and has a daughter and a son. His son Marcus is the running backs coach at Hampton University after serving as the Bengals&#x27; defensive line and quality control coach.

<doc id="963070" wikidata="Q60438" url="?curid=963070" title="Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria">
<text>Ferdinand Maria (31 October 1636 – 26 May 1679) was a Wittelsbach ruler of Bavaria and a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 1651 to 1679. The Elector modernized the army and introduced Bavaria&#x27;s first government code. Besides encouraging agriculture and industry, he also improved building and restoration works on churches and monasteries since the damage caused during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Electoral Prince of Bavaria==
He was born in Munich. He was the eldest son of Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria (whom he succeeded), and his second wife, Maria Anna of Austria, daughter of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor.

Born during the reign of his father, he was known as the Electoral Prince from birth. Through his mother, he was a first cousin of Queen Mariana of Spain as well as Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.

On 8 December 1650, he married Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, daughter of Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy and Christine Marie of France. The couple had seven children, only two of whom would have offspring.

==Elector==
Still a minor when he succeeded his father in 1651, his mother became his guardian and his uncle, Albert VI of Bavaria served as Prince Regent of Bavaria for three years.

Ferdinand Maria was crowned on 31 October 1654. His absolutistic style of leadership became a benchmark for the rest of Germany. Though Ferdinand Maria was allied with France, he made no attempt to oppose the Habsburg candidate at the 1658 imperial election after the death of his uncle Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor to avoid conflict. Ferdinand Maria supported the Habsburgs in the Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664) against the Ottoman Empire, providing Bavarian contingents for the Army of the Holy Roman Empire. Under his leadership, Bavaria was officially neutral during the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678). Plans for a Bavarian colony near New York were discussed but soon abandoned.

The marriage of his eldest daughter Maria Anna Victoria and her cousin &quot;le Grand Dauphin&quot; in 1680 was the outcome of the Bavarian alliance with France. Ferdinand Maria was the great grandfather of the future French monarch Louis XV.

Ferdinand Maria modernized the Bavarian Army and introduced the first Bavarian local government code. The Elector did much indeed to repair the wounds caused by the Thirty Years&#x27; War, encouraging agriculture and industries, and building or restoring numerous churches and monasteries. In 1669, moreover, he again called a meeting of the diet, which had been suspended since 1612. At the end of his reign he left the electorate with a very wealthy treasury.

He died at the Old Schleissheim Palace and was succeeded by his son Maximilian II Emanuel. He was buried in the crypt of the Theatine Church, Munich.

==Cultural legacy==
Ferdinand Maria married Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy in 1650; and with her, the Italian Baroque was introduced in Bavaria.

The Theatine Church, Munich was built from 1663 onwards as a gesture of thanks for the birth of the long-awaited heir to the Bavarian crown, Prince Maximilian II Emanuel. After that in 1664, Ferdinand Maria and his wife commissioned the building of the Baroque style Nymphenburg Palace near Munich based on the designs of Italian architect Agostino Barelli.

Lake Starnberg was purchased by Ferdinand Maria from the Horwarth family and it became the venue of numerous festivities of the court with the famous fleet of Venetian Gondolas. On the lake&#x27;s shores, he ordered the construction of Berg Castle in 1676.

The castle was used for festivities there and later reached its zenith when it became the scene of spectacular entertainments and hunts under the rule of his successors, Maximilian Emanuel and Emperor Charles VII. For the Munich Residenz, Ferdinand Maria ordered the creation of the Papal Rooms.

==Issue==

* Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria (28 November 1660 – 20 April 1690) married Louis, Dauphin of France, and had issue.
* Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria (11 July 1662 – 26 February 1726); married Maria Antonia of Austria and had issue; married Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska and had issue.

<doc id="963071" wikidata="Q6386079" url="?curid=963071" title="Kelly Holcomb">
<text>Bryan Kelly Holcomb (born July 9, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders. Holcomb was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent after the 1995 NFL draft. He was also a member of the Indianapolis Colts, Cleveland Browns, Buffalo Bills, Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings.

==Early years and family life==
Holcomb attended Lincoln County High School in Fayetteville, Tennessee, and was a student and lettered in football as a quarterback, baseball as a shortstop, and basketball and led his football team to the 1990 Tennessee State Championship.
He and his wife Lorie have 3 kids: Kellyn, Jalyn, and Jameson.

==College career==
Holcomb played college football at Middle Tennessee State University. During his freshman season in 1991, his near-perfect performance versus then No. 1 ranked Florida State at Doak Campbell Stadium versus a secondary that featured future NFL players Terrell Buckley and Clifton Abraham put him on the map. For the day, Holcomb completed 20 of 28 passes for 188 yards in his first college start.

He finally broke out statistically as a senior, throwing for over 2,000 yards with 15 TD.

*1991: 130/209 for 1,763 yards with 5 TD vs 4 INT.
*1992: 92/168 for 1,409 yards with 9 TD vs 6 INT.
*1993: 133/240 for 1,738 yards with 7 TD vs 6 INT.
*1994: 146/244 for 2,154 yards with 15 TD vs 9 INT.

==Professional career==

===World League of American Football===
Holcomb was quarterback for the now-defunct Barcelona Dragons of World League of American Football in 1996.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Holcomb spent the 1995 season on the Buccaneers practice squad. He was released in 1996, as the Buccaneers opted to go with Scott Milanovich as the team&#x27;s No. 3 quarterback.

===Indianapolis Colts===
Holcomb was signed by the Indianapolis Colts as a street free-agent in 1996. His first season he didn&#x27;t play a regular season game. In 1997, a disappointing season, Holcomb played five games and started one in which he threw only one touchdown and eight interceptions. Holcomb never saw action in a regular season game for the Colts again.

===Cleveland Browns===
A backup to Peyton Manning of Indianapolis, Holcomb was cut in the 2001 off-season to be allowed to compete for the starting job with the Cleveland Browns, following Bruce Arians who left as the QB coach of the Colts to become the offensive coordinator of the Browns. The Browns had drafted Tim Couch with the number 1 pick in the 1999 draft. During their time in Cleveland, Holcomb occasionally outshined the former number one pick. In his first season as a Brown, Holcomb played in only one game which he completed seven of twelve passes for 114 yards and a passing touchdown. In Holcomb&#x27;s second season he played in four games and started two games in which he threw eight touchdowns and four interceptions with 790 passing yards. In 2003, his third season, he had more playing time playing ten games and starting eight of them. He replaced Tim Couch as starting quarterback during that season. In that season he threw ten touchdowns and twelve interceptions and had a strong play-off performance in a loss to the Steelers where he threw for 429 yards and three touchdowns, nearly leading a late comeback to win the game. In his final season as a Brown Jeff Garcia replaced him as starting quarterback. Holcomb only played in four games and started two of them in which he threw seven touchdowns and five interceptions with 737 yards passing.

===Buffalo Bills===
Holcomb went to the Buffalo Bills before the 2005 season. He started half of the games in his first season as a Bill while J. P. Losman started the other half. Holcomb threw ten touchdowns and eight interceptions with 1,509 passing yards that season. In Holcomb&#x27;s second and final season as a Bill he didn&#x27;t play a regular season game the whole season.

He was traded on March 26, 2007, to the Philadelphia Eagles with Takeo Spikes for Darwin Walker and a conditional 2008 draft pick, which the Bills would use to select Stevie Johnson. However, Holcomb never played a regular season game as an Eagle and was quickly traded.

===Minnesota Vikings===
On August 27, 2007, the Philadelphia Eagles traded Holcomb to the Minnesota Vikings for a sixth round pick in the 2009 NFL draft. Holcomb played and started three games that season throwing two touchdowns and an interception with 515 passing yards. After the 2007 season, the Vikings then went on to release him on February 27, 2008.

===Retirement===
On July 7, 2008, it was announced that Holcomb would retire from the NFL.

===Memorable moments===
A Wild Card game against Pittsburgh in January 2003 saw Holcomb, playing for the Browns, become the third quarterback in playoff history to throw for more than 400 yards. He finished the game with 429 yards, a new postseason record for a regulation game.

==Broadcasting career/post-playing career==
In 2008, Holcomb joined his alma mater Middle Tennessee as the color commentator for the Blue Raider Radio Network. In addition, Holcomb has broadcast the TSSAA Blue Cross Bowl and was a broadcast member of the Music City Bowl Preview.

In February 2015, it was announced that Holcomb would be joining the coaching staff at Riverdale (Tenn.) HS, where he would be handling offensive coordinator duties.

<text>The Royal Yeomanry (RY) is the senior reserve cavalry regiment of the British Army. Equipped with Supacat Jackal variants, their role is to conduct mounted and dismounted formation reconnaissance. The Regimental Headquarters is located in Leicester, with squadrons in Fulham, Nottingham, Dudley, Croydon (with an outstation in Windsor), Telford (with an outstation in Cardiff), and Leicester. The regiment is part of the Royal Armoured Corps and is only reserve cavalry regiment to resubordinate into regular brigade as part of the Future Soldier Programme, which in turn arose from the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (&quot;Global Britain in a Competitive Age&quot;) published in March 2021.

The Royal Yeomanry is the only British Army reserve unit to have been awarded a battle honour since the Second World War.

==History==

===Formation and succession===

The Royal Yeomanry Regiment (Volunteers) was raised on 1 April 1967, after the Territorial Army was disbanded the previous day under the Reserve Forces Act 1966 and replaced by a newly constituted organisation, the TAVR (Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve).

The Royal Yeomanry Regiment (Volunteers) was in TAVR II. For four years, it was the only Royal Armoured Corps yeomanry reserve regiment: hence its generic name. In 1971, three new RAC Yeomanry regiments (the Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry, the Mercian Yeomanry and the Wessex Yeomanry) were raised and the Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s name was shortened to its current one; the opportunity to give it a more distinctive name was missed. The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry was given the same NATO role as the Royal Yeomanry, while the other two were Home Defence light reconnaissance.

===The Cold War===

The Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s role during the Cold War was medium armoured reconnaissance. Its primary task was to operate as a mobile force to protect the massive, widespread logistic assets of the Corps, and certain key bridges against covert attacks and airborne descents by Soviet special forces. In addition it trained to perform the full range of medium armoured reconnaissance tasks for general war. The Royal Yeomanry was equipped with armoured cars, first Saladin, Saracen and Ferret, then Fox, Spartan and Sultan. Each squadron had an establishment (maximum number of personnel) of around 120, operated 30 armoured vehicles and around 15 soft-skinned vehicles and was supported by a team of 11 regular army instructors and five local civilian staff.

===Nineties===

The ‘peace dividend’ review of the Armed Forces (‘Options for Change’) which followed the end of the Cold War saw substantial changes to the Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s role, equipment and establishment. These were justified by the then Secretary of State for Defence on the basis of a perceived &quot;need to adapt [the Territorial Army&#x27;s] roles to support and complement the new roles of the regular army. Under the previous strategy, it had important roles defending positions close to the previous West German border in support of the substantial British stationed forces. Clearly this task is no longer relevant in a unified Germany and under the new NATO strategy of greater flexibility and mobility. Instead, new opportunities arise to be part of the Rapid Reaction Corps and in national defence, and it is for these new roles and responsibilities that the Territorial Army units must now be structured and trained.&quot;

As a result, in 1992 the Royal Yeomanry was reduced in status and function to align with what were by then four other RAC yeomanry regiments and become national defence light reconnaissance, converting from armour to the Scout Land Rover and reducing in establishment by half, to between 50 and 60 personnel per squadron. At this time, the Royal Yeomanry lost two squadrons to the Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry (one in Nottingham, which later returned to the regiment, and the other in Northern Ireland) and gained one (in Leicester).

The Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s national defence role encompassed a wide spectrum of possible operational uses. They included NATO, United Nations and national operations worldwide, as well as military aid to the civil authorities in the United Kingdom and military home defence. However, the role was perceived to be ill-defined and too broad a set of potential outputs to train against using limited resources. At a time when the Territorial Army was under continuing pressure to reduce in size and capabilities, this was regarded as potentially imperilling the regiment&#x27;s existence. A more definite role that would address a clear Defence requirement was needed. Consequently, in 1996 the Royal Yeomanry accepted the role of being the British Army&#x27;s only specialist nuclear, biological and chemical defence regiment, taking on the 11 Fuchs CBRN reconnaissance vehicles which had been acquired by the British Army during the 1990 Gulf War.

The Royal Yeomanry served exclusively in the CBRN (or NBC) role from 1996 until 1999. During this time, its first operational deployments began. On 1 April 1999, on the recommendation of the Strategic Defence Review, the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment (originally, the Joint NBC Regiment) was formed as a joint regular Army and Royal Air Force unit composed of four squadrons of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment and 27 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment. The Royal Yeomanry was therefore reconfigured and partly re-roled. Two of the Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s squadrons (A and W) were retained in the CBRN role to provide reserves for the new Joint NBC Regiment. The three non-CBRN squadrons converted to Challenger 2 to serve as reserves for armoured regiments. The establishment of each squadron was increased to 80–90. The regiment lost D (Berkshire Yeomanry) Squadron in Slough to disbandment but regained S (Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry) Squadron in Nottingham from the Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry.

===2000s to Present===

In 2006, as a result of the changes to the Territorial Army triggered by the Future Army Structure unveiled by the Ministry of Defence in 2004, the Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s role ceased to be split between CBRN and Challenger 2 reserves. It was consolidated into a single role: &#x27;formation CBRN reconnaissance&#x27;. In practice, this meant continuing to train as CBRN specialists and as RAC crew using the Scout Land Rover as a surrogate training platform, while also training as CVR(T) crew. This change paved the way for the uplift of each squadron&#x27;s vehicle fleet to include two CVR(T) Spartan armoured fighting vehicles for training purposes. Soldiers and officers of the Royal Yeomanry then began to deploy to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK as Scimitar, Spartan and Samaritan gunners, drivers and loaders.

Since 2013 the Royal Yeomanry has been a reserve light cavalry regiment. In that year, under the Reserves in the Future Force 2020 White Paper and the reserves basing plan announced by the Secretary of State for Defence on 5 July 2013, the regiment was paired with 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards (QDG). On 24 February 2015, as part the same Army 2020 reorganisation programme, the Royal Yeomanry was transferred from under the command of Headquarters London District to that of 7th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters East within 1st (United Kingdom) Division as the brigade switched from its armour role into that of an infantry brigade and regional point of command. The regiment gained two squadrons (in Telford and Dudley) of the disbanded Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry but lost a squadron (in Swindon) to the Royal Wessex Yeomanry under the Army 2020 reforms. 

Under Army 2020 (Refine), it was confirmed that the Royal Yeomanry would (exceptionally) retain all six of its squadrons, two of which had been under threat of deletion under the 2013 plan. It was also confirmed that the squadron which the regiment had lost to the Royal Wessex Yeomanry would also be retained at squadron size. Furthermore as a result of the ongoing 2021 Future Soldier (British Army) reforms, the Royal Yeomanry was resubordinated to the 3rd (United Kingdom) Division under the newly raised 1st Deep Recce Strike Brigade Combat Team with the restructure due to be complete by October 2023.

The Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s current light cavalry role is to provide a rapidly deployable force with fast mobility and substantial firepower as part of the British Army&#x27;s combat arm. Its soldiers provide reconnaissance, reassurance, security and, if the situation demands it, decisive tactical effects by raiding and attacking the enemy.

==Operational Deployments==
The Royal Yeomanry&#x27;s first operational deployment was in 1998 as CBRN/NBC specialists, to Kuwait. Some 35 members of the regiment deployed in August 1998 to set up biological detection systems in advance of Operation DESERT FOX (the Bombing of Iraq (1998)) and stayed on as part of Operation BOLTON. Between 1998 and 2002, some 44 members of the regiment deployed on operations to Kuwait, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (Operation PALATINE) and Kosovo (Operation AGRICOLA).

In January 2003, A (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) and W (Westminster Dragoons) Squadrons were mobilised together with the Regimental Headquarters for Operation TELIC, the war in Iraq. The two squadrons were amalgamated with a number of augmentees from the other three squadrons of the Royal Yeomanry and from 160 Transport Regiment Royal Logistic Corps to form a much-enlarged &quot;Y&quot; Squadron comprising 116 personnel, which deployed as part of the Joint NBC Regiment. Despite being held at 180 days&#x27; notice for mobilisation, the Royal Yeomanry deployed to the operational theatre by 4 March 2003, three months after the commanding officer had received a warning order and less than six weeks after those who mobilised had received their call-out notices. This was the first deployment of a formed TA unit (TA soldiers under TA command) for combat operations since the Suez crisis in 1956.

During the warfighting phase, formed complete troops (an officer and 12 soldiers) of the Royal Yeomanry were attached to 16 Air Assault Brigade, 7 Armoured Brigade (the Desert Rats) and 3 Commando Brigade for the invasion as NBC specialists. The remainder of the squadron had responsibility for NBC support to 1st (United Kingdom) Armoured Division&#x27;s rear area. The Regimental Headquarters was detached from 1st (United Kingdom) Armoured Division to the US 75th Exploitation Task Force and Coalition Force Land Component Command to act as the liaison between the UK and US NBC efforts throughout the theatre of operations. Once the war-fighting phase was over, Y Sqn reverted to being under the operational command of Commanding Officer Royal Yeomanry and undertook peace support operations to the north of Al-Qurnah following a relief-in-place with elements of 16 Air Assault Brigade.

The Royal Yeomanry maintained a constant presence in Iraq from March 2003 until the end of Operation TELIC, including a substantial deployment on Op TELIC 4 of 53 members of the non-NBC squadrons to augment the Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers and 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales&#x27; Royal Regiment, serving principally as infantry but also in the armoured role.

From 2007 to 2014, the Royal Yeomanry also provided officers and soldiers for Operation HERRICK in Afghanistan, including a deployment of seven soldiers on Operation HERRICK 7 (one of whom, Corporal James Dunsby, served as gunner in HRH Prince Harry&#x27;s armoured fighting vehicle).

In 2018, the Royal Yeomanry undertook its first operational deployments with its paired regular regiment, the 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, sending 3 officers and 11 soldiers on Operation CABRIT 3 and 4 to Poland as part of NATO&#x27;s Enhanced Forward Presence.

==Recruitment==
The Royal Yeomanry mainly recruits from Greater London, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Kent, Shropshire and Worcestershire.

==Training==

Army Reserve soldiers with no previous military service complete the Common Military Syllabus (Reserves) course, also known as Phase 1 training. After completing Phase 1, soldiers in the Royal Yeomanry move on to &quot;special-to-arm&quot; (Phase 2) training as light cavalry soldiers. This consists of courses in gunnery (Heavy Machine Gun and General Purpose Machine Gun), signals (Bowman communication system), and driving (Land Rover &quot;RWMIK&quot; and Supacat Jackal) delivered by the Royal Yeomanry by Army Reserve soldiers and also by Regular Army instructors in centres such as the Armour Centre. In addition, field training exercises develop tactics and situational awareness, as well as the ability to operate away from base for long periods. Royal Yeomanry soldiers also undertake training in dismounted close combat (which includes rifle marksmanship and physical fitness training).

The training commitment for the Army Reserve Light Cavalry is around 40 reserve service days per year. This normally consists of a 16-day consolidated training period plus (typically) at least four 2.5-day weekends throughout the year, as well as one weekday evening (0.25 days) per week. The light cavalry role is physically arduous and members of the Royal Yeomanry are required to meet the Army Reserve Ground Close Combat fitness standards, so Royal Yeomanry officers and soldiers are required to undertake physical fitness training in their own time in addition to what is provided to them by physical training instructors.

==Equipment==

The regiment&#x27;s main equipment is the Supacat Jackal, a light armoured vehicle equipped with the General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) and the Browning M2 .50 Heavy Machine Gun (HMG).

==Organisation==
The Royal Yeomanry is one of the two light cavalry regiments in 1st Deep Reconnaissance Strike Brigade Combat Team, which in turn is part of 3rd (United Kingdom) Division. The other light cavalry regiment is the Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, the regiment&#x27;s paired unit.

The regiment&#x27;s current organisation (following 2021 changes) is as follows:

* Regimental Headquarters, in South Wigston, Leicester (moved from Fulham)
* A (Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry) Squadron, in Carlton, Nottingham
* B (Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Squadron, at Alamein House, Dudley – formerly B (Staffordshire, Warwick, and Worcs Yeo) Sqn
* C (Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry) Squadron, at The Barracks, Croydon
** 3 Troop, at Combermere Barracks, Windsor
* D (Shropshire Yeomanry) Squadron, in Telford
** Cardiff Troop, in Cardiff (formed in 2021)
* E (Leicestershire and Derbyshire Yeomanry) Squadron, in South Wigston, Leicester
* F (Westminster Dragoons) Squadron, at Fulham House, Fulham, London

===Band===
The Inns of Court and City Yeomanry provides the regimental band, a tradition dating back to the late 1960s. It was formed in 1961 following the amalgamation of the two regiments. It is one of only two Army Reserve Bands in London with the status of &quot;State Band&quot;. The band is currently based at Holderness House in London. They undertake activities overseas, including providing musical support to regimental celebrations in France and Belgium, and training the musicians of the Military Band Institute of the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia.

==Battle Honours==


As a result of the Regiment&#x27;s initial service during the Iraq war, in 2005 the Royal Yeomanry was awarded the battle honour &quot;Iraq 2003&quot;. This is the first such honour the regiment has won since its formation, and the first battle honour awarded to an Army Reserve regiment since the Second World War. The honour is carried on the regiment&#x27;s guidon. The guidon, presented to the regiment on 7 May 2016, additionally bears 40 of the battle honours won by its antecedent regiments. As well as these, the guidon also carries an artillery badge as a distinction, and four theatre honours awarded to those of its antecedents that were converted to artillery during the Second World War.

Willis Davidge, a human fighter pilot, is stranded along with Jeriba Shigan, a Drac, on a hostile planet. The Drac are a race of aliens which are reptilian in appearance, and are hermaphrodites who reproduce parthenogenetically.

===&quot;The Tomorrow Testament&quot;===
&quot;The Tomorrow Testament&quot; chronicles the capture of Joanne Nicole, a human female, at the hands of the Dracs. Soon after she is blinded by a USEF bombing raid. She is taken in by a high-ranking Drac military officer, where, like Davidge, she learns the Talman. While she recovers, she discovers that the war between Dracs and Humans was the result of a conspiracy by another race called the Timans. She writes the tale of her life, capture, and personal growth, and submits it as the first book of the Talman not authored by a Drac: &quot;The Eyes of Joanne Nicole&quot;.

===&quot;The Last Enemy&quot;===
&quot;The Last Enemy&quot; begins on the planet Amadeen, on which the human-Drac war began. A treaty was resolved in &quot;The Tomorrow Testament&quot; which limited the fighting to this single planet. It chronicles how the conflict is eventually ended by the actions of Davidge and Yazi Ro, a Drac from Amadeen.

===&quot;The Talman&quot;===
This chapter consists of stories from Dracs&#x27; holy book. Contains the Story of Uhe, the Myth of Aakva, fragments of the Story of Shizumaat, and other tales. The Story of Shizumaat makes up the majority of the text, as Shizumaat is the Dracs&#x27; most important philosopher. Many of the works contains moral or philosophical statements as to how Dracs should live their lives.</text><links>

<text>Philip Sheridan English (born June 20, 1956) is an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1995–2009 from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, representing the state&#x27;s 3rd Congressional district.

After 14 years in the U.S. House, he was defeated for reelection by Democrat Kathy Dahlkemper on November 4, 2008.

==Early life and career==
English is a lifelong resident of Erie and is of Irish and German descent. He attended Portsmouth Abbey School in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. While in college, he served as Chairman of the PA Federation of College Republicans.

English served as Erie City Controller from 1985 to 1989. In 1988 he was the Republican nominee for State Treasurer but was defeated by Democrat Catherine Baker Knoll. He stayed in politics and served as Chief of Staff for then State Senator Melissa Hart.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
English was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 after seven-term incumbent Tom Ridge vacated the seat to make a successful run for governor. English benefited from the Republican wave of 1994 as well as Ridge&#x27;s coattails. In addition, the Democrats had a crowded primary in which the Erie candidates split the vote, which allowed Sharon attorney Bill Leavens to win the primary. English, as a native of Erie, then garnered enough support from his hometown (generally a Democratic stronghold) to win the election.

English was re-elected in a close race in 1996 against Erie attorney and Marine Corps veteran Ron DiNicola as Bill Clinton carried the district. However, he was handily reelected in 1998 on Ridge&#x27;s coattails, and didn&#x27;t face a close race again until 2006. That year, he defeated Steve Porter by only 54% to 42% (with 4% going to Constitution Party candidate Tim Hagberg). Porter was an unknown retired college professor who spent virtually no money; he raised only $81,100 to English&#x27;s $1.4 million.

English was liberal on economic matters and conservative on social matters. Unusually for a Republican, he had strong ties to organized labor. However, this served him well in a district that was dominated by the heavily Democratic and thoroughly unionized city of Erie (no other city in the district has more than 17,000 people).

English moved up the seniority ladder in the House over the years. From his first term, he was a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee—the first freshman Republican to be appointed to this committee since 1975. In the 110th Congress, English served as the ranking member on the Subcommittee of Select Revenue Measures.

==2008 election==
English&#x27;s narrow win in 2006 led the Democrats to target his seat in 2008. He faced first-time candidate and small businesswoman Kathy Dahlkemper in the November election.

The race captured considerable national attention. Although English outspent Dahlkemper—raising $2.2 million to Dahlkemper&#x27;s $872,000—the Democratic House Campaign Committee overwhelmed English overall in spending on media buys and direct mail.

In the election, English was defeated, taking 48 percent of the vote to Dahlkemper&#x27;s 52 percent. English carried five of the district&#x27;s seven counties, but could not overcome a 14-point deficit in his native Erie County, the largest county in the district.

<doc id="963078" wikidata="Q1764806" url="?curid=963078" title="From Me to You">
<text>&quot;From Me to You&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released in April 1963 as their third single. It was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The song was the Beatles&#x27; first number 1 hit on what became the official UK singles chart but the second, after &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, on most of the other singles charts published in the UK at the time. &quot;From Me to You&quot; failed to make an impact in the United States at the time of its initial release. Instead, a 1963 cover version released by Del Shannon resulted in the song&#x27;s becoming the first Lennon–McCartney track to enter the US pop charts. The Beatles&#x27; original was re-released in the US in January 1964 as the B-side to &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, and reached number 41.

==Composition==
Lennon and McCartney began writing &quot;From Me to You&quot; while on a coach heading to Shrewsbury as part of the Beatles&#x27; tour with Helen Shapiro. The title was inspired by the name of the letters section of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, which they had been reading: &quot;From You to Us&quot;. McCartney noted that their early songs tended to include the words &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot; or &quot;you&quot; in them, as a way of making them &quot;very direct and personal&quot; to the band&#x27;s fans.

In his 1980 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, Lennon recalled writing the song:

Before that interview, Lennon had stated, &quot;We nearly didn&#x27;t record it because we thought it was too bluesy at first, but when we&#x27;d finished it and George Martin had scored it with harmonica, it was alright.&quot;

McCartney also talked about rearranging the song in 1964:
 
Singer-songwriter Roger Greenaway recounted a story:

Regardless, the song was regarded by the Beatles as innovative and catchy enough to be released as a single. This was one Lennon–McCartney song that the duo truly co-wrote; McCartney described it as &quot;very much co-written&quot;.

==Melody and lyrics==

&quot;From Me to You&quot; comprises five verses and two bridges. The form is Intro V V B V V B V Coda. The first half of the fourth verse is instrumental. The last half of each verse is a mini-refrain, while the lyrics of the bridges are identical. The verses each consist of a rather short eight measures played in C major. In the bridge the song modulates to the subdominant (IV) key: F major. The tonic-subdominant modulation is almost a cliché, but Lennon &amp; McCartney avoid the cliché by going another route from I to IV than the standard I–I7–IV. At the bridge&#x27;s climax, the chord changes are accompanied by &quot;woo!&quot; Another characterising element in the bridge is the augmented chord – a Gaug – that ends the bridge and leads back to home key (C major). Lennon plays prominent harmonica solos during the beginning, middle and end of the song, as he did with &quot;Love Me Do&quot;.

McCartney said of the song:

The idea of singing the song&#x27;s opening lick—the &quot;da da da da da dum dum da&quot; part—was suggested by George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; producer. The group thought it unusual but put their trust in Martin. &quot;In a way, this made [the Beatles] aware of George&#x27;s enormous musical sense,&quot; EMI producer Ron Richards later said.

In the song, the singer offers his love to the object of his affections—he has &quot;everything that you want&quot;. Although the song is based on singular first-person pronouns, it lacks a lead singer.

==Recording and UK release==
George Martin said of the song, &quot;I asked them for another song as good as &#x27;Please Please Me&#x27;, and they brought me one—&#x27;From Me to You.&#x27; ... There seemed to be a bottomless well of songs.&quot;

The recording on 5 March 1963 at EMI Studios took 6 takes with 7 edit pieces and went without a hitch and on 11 April Parlophone released &quot;From Me to You&quot; in the UK as a single, with &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; on the B-side, catalogue number R5015. Nine days later, it kicked off a twenty-one week run in the British charts, reaching number one on 4 May, a position it would retain for seven weeks.

&quot;From Me to You&quot; featured Lennon playing harmonica in a Jimmy Reed-inspired blues style he had learned from Delbert McClinton, another American who was on the same bill with the Beatles in the early Sixties. &quot;It&#x27;s chiseled in stone now that I taught Lennon how to play harmonica,&quot; McClinton said. &quot;John said, &#x27;Show me something.&#x27; I was in a pretty unique position, because there just weren&#x27;t a lot of people playing harmonica in popular music.&quot;

&quot;From Me to You&quot; was the first Beatles song to reach number one in the UK and is widely considered to be their first chart-topping song, for although &quot;Please Please Me&quot; reached the summit on almost every chart, it was only number two on &quot;Record Retailer&quot;″s chart, generally considered to be the most authoritative for the time. &quot;From Me to You&quot; would be the first of eleven consecutive British number one singles by the Beatles.

&quot;From Me to You&quot; replaced Gerry and the Pacemakers&#x27; &quot;How Do You Do It&quot;, a song that had been offered to the Beatles (and even recorded by them, though it remained officially unreleased until 1995) but ultimately rejected by them in favour of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers, who also hailed from Liverpool, were very much rivals of the Beatles in their early days—Gerry and the Pacemakers attained the first number one (&quot;How Do You Do It&quot;) before the Beatles, and also claimed their second and third number ones before the Beatles did, slowly losing steam afterwards as Beatlemania launched and the Beatles dominated music worldwide in 1964.

A true indication of how successful the Beatles became thanks to &quot;From Me to You&quot; (though it would soon be overshadowed by &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;) was expressed by McCartney: &quot;The first time I thought we&#x27;d really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling &#x27;From Me to You&#x27;. Actually, I&#x27;m sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!&quot;

==First US release==
When it released &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in the United States, Vee-Jay Records signed a licensing agreement giving it the right of first refusal on Beatles records for five years. Despite the failure of &quot;Please Please Me&quot; to catch on, Vee-Jay chose to release &quot;From Me to You&quot;; as a result, it was never turned down by Capitol, because it was never offered to them. &quot;From Me to You&quot; was released on Vee-Jay 522, with &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; on the B-side, on 27 May 1963. Even though &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine called it a &quot;Pick of the Week&quot; when it was released, it initially failed even more miserably than its predecessor; through the end of June, &quot;From Me to You&quot; sold fewer than 4,000 copies and had failed to chart anywhere.

When Del Shannon released a cover version of &quot;From Me to You&quot; on Bigtop Records in June , Vee-Jay tried to stimulate more interest in the original, both by placing magazine ads and by sending out additional promotional copies of the 45 stamped with the words &quot;The Original Hit&quot;. But the biggest boost to the Beatles&#x27; version came from Dick Biondi, who had played &quot;Please Please Me&quot; on WLS in Chicago. Biondi was fired by WLS in May and relocated to KRLA 1110 in Los Angeles in June. He was able to convince his new employer to add &quot;From Me to You&quot; to its playlist, and it entered KRLA&#x27;s &quot;Tune-Dex&quot; on 14 July, spending six weeks on the chart and peaking at 32 on 11 August.

Because of the airplay, and resulting sales, in Los Angeles, &quot;From Me to You&quot; made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart for three weeks, peaking at number 116 on 10 August, the same time the single peaked in Los Angeles. It was the first time the Beatles appeared on a national chart in &quot;Billboard&quot;. The late attention in Los Angeles spurred sales of the 45; in the end, the original edition of &quot;From Me to You&quot; sold approximately 22,000 copies, roughly three times as many as &quot;Please Please Me&quot; had.

==Second US release==
Vee-Jay chose to couple &quot;From Me to You&quot; with &quot;Please Please Me&quot; when it re-released the single on 3 January 1964, shortly after film of the Beatles had appeared on &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot;, the NBC television prime-time version of Paar&#x27;s previous &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. Had Vee-Jay known how all-encompassing Beatlemania would become, it likely would have saved &quot;From Me to You&quot; for use as an A-side, the way it did with &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;. But even as a B-side, &quot;From Me to You&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on 7 March and peaked at number 41 and number 6 in Canada. The double-sided hit sold approximately 1.1 million copies in 1964.

==&quot;Help!&quot;==
An instrumental arrangement, &quot;From Me to You Fantasy&quot; is used in the film, &quot;Help!&quot;, arranged by Ken Thorne, and is track 3 of the original U.S. release of the soundtrack album. It appears during scenes of attempts to remove the ring from Ringo&#x27;s finger while he sleeps in the Beatles&#x27; communal apartment.

==Album availability==
&quot;From Me to You&quot; made its first album appearance (overall) on the Canadian &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; LP in 1964. That same year, it made its US album debut on Vee-Jay&#x27;s &quot;Jolly What! England&#x27;s Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage&quot;; its first appearance on a &quot;regular&quot; US Beatles album wouldn&#x27;t come until 1973 when it appeared on the double LP compilation &quot;1962–1966&quot;. In 1966, &quot;From Me to You&quot; was first issued in the UK on &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot;, followed by the &quot;1962–1966&quot; compilation seven years later. The first release on CD was in 1988 when it was included in the &quot;Past Masters&quot; compilation. It was later released on the &quot;1962–1966&quot; double CD and the single CD compilation &quot;1&quot;.

==Alternative mixes==
The mono version, which was issued as a single in 1963, has appeared on the 1988 issue of &quot;Past Masters&quot;, the &quot;1962–1966&quot; CD reissues, the &quot;1&quot; compilation released in 2000, and &quot;Mono Masters&quot; in 2009. The stereo version was included on the 1966 compilation &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot;, the original LP issues of &quot;1962–1966&quot; in 1973, and the 2009 reissue of &quot;Past Masters&quot;. The intro to the stereo version (recorded on two tracks) lacks the harmonica inserted into the mono mix.

==Del Shannon cover==
On 18 April 1963, the Beatles were one of 15 acts to play at &quot;Swinging Sound &#x27;63&quot;, an all-star concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. They played &quot;From Me to You&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;. Del Shannon was also on the bill that night. After the concert, he told John Lennon that he was going to record &quot;From Me to You&quot; because he liked the falsetto parts in the song. At first, Lennon was flattered, but he quickly changed his mind, realizing that a cover version by Shannon might hurt the Beatles&#x27; chances of having a hit in the States. As it turned out, Lennon was temporarily right, but neither artist&#x27;s version was a big hit in America.

In early June, Bigtop Records released Shannon&#x27;s version of &quot;From Me to You&quot; as the follow-up to &quot;Two Kinds of Teardrops.&quot; It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 29 June, becoming the first Lennon–McCartney composition to make the American charts. It spent four weeks on the chart and peaked at number 77. It was even more successful in Chicago as it peaked at number 15 on the WLS &quot;Silver Dollar Survey&quot;.

Shannon&#x27;s recording follows the Beatles&#x27; original almost verbatim, except for a slightly faster tempo and fade-out. &quot;At that time no one had heard of the Beatles here (the US), but I knew they were great writers so I just picked up on one of their songs,&quot; Shannon said later.

===Chart history===
==Later versions==

Bobby McFerrin covered the song in his 1986 album, &quot;Spontaneous Inventions&quot;.

In November 2008, a slowed-down cover version using only piano and vocals became the first Beatles song to be used in a British advertising campaign when it was used in John Lewis&#x27; Christmas marketing.

On 4 March 2016, a remixed version of the song was released by Yolanda Be Cool &amp; DCUP.

American indie rock band Futurebirds included the song on its 2016 EP &quot;Portico I&quot;.

<doc id="963084" wikidata="Q1484552" url="?curid=963084" title="Register-transfer level">
<text>In digital circuit design, register-transfer level (RTL) is a design abstraction which models a synchronous digital circuit in terms of the flow of digital signals (data) between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. 

Register-transfer-level abstraction is used in hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL to create high-level representations of a circuit, from which lower-level representations and ultimately actual wiring can be derived. Design at the RTL level is typical practice in modern digital design.

Unlike in software compiler design, where the register-transfer level is an intermediate representation and at the lowest level, the RTL level is the usual input that circuit designers operate on. In fact, in circuit synthesis, an intermediate language between the input register transfer level representation and the target netlist is sometimes used. Unlike in netlist, constructs such as cells, functions, and multi-bit registers are available. Examples include FIRRTL and RTLIL.

Transaction-level modeling is a higher level of electronic system design.

==RTL description==
A synchronous circuit consists of two kinds of elements: registers (sequential logic) and combinational logic. Registers (usually implemented as D flip-flops) synchronize the circuit&#x27;s operation to the edges of the clock signal, and are the only elements in the circuit that have memory properties. Combinational logic performs all the logical functions in the circuit and it typically consists of logic gates.

For example, a very simple synchronous circuit is shown in the figure. The inverter is connected from the output, Q, of a register to the register&#x27;s input, D, to create a circuit that changes its state on each rising edge of the clock, clk. In this circuit, the combinational logic consists of the inverter.

When designing digital integrated circuits with a hardware description language (HDL), the designs are usually engineered at a higher level of abstraction than transistor level (logic families) or logic gate level. In HDLs the designer declares the registers (which roughly correspond to variables in computer programming languages), and describes the combinational logic by using constructs that are familiar from programming languages such as if-then-else and arithmetic operations. This level is called &quot;register-transfer level&quot;. The term refers to the fact that RTL focuses on describing the flow of signals between registers.

As an example, the circuit mentioned above can be described in VHDL as follows:
D &lt;= not Q;
process(clk)
begin
 if rising_edge(clk) then
 Q &lt;= D;
 end if;
end process;
Using an EDA tool for synthesis, this description can usually be directly translated to an equivalent hardware implementation file for an ASIC or an FPGA. The synthesis tool also performs logic optimization.

At the register-transfer level, some types of circuits can be recognized. If there is a cyclic path of logic from a register&#x27;s output to its input (or from a set of registers outputs to its inputs), the circuit is called a state machine or can be said to be sequential logic. If there are logic paths from a register to another without a cycle, it is called a pipeline.

==RTL in the circuit design cycle==
RTL is used in the logic design phase of the integrated circuit design cycle.

An RTL description is usually converted to a gate-level description of the circuit by a logic synthesis tool. The synthesis results are then used by placement and routing tools to create a physical layout.

Logic simulation tools may use a design&#x27;s RTL description to verify its correctness.

==Power estimation techniques for RTL==
The most accurate power analysis tools are available for the circuit level but unfortunately, even with switch- rather than device-level modelling, tools at the circuit level have disadvantages like they are either too slow or require too much memory thus inhibiting large chip handling. The majority of these are simulators like SPICE and have been used by the designers for many years as performance analysis tools. Due to these disadvantages, gate-level power estimation tools have begun to gain some acceptance where faster, probabilistic techniques have begun to gain a foothold. But it also has its trade off as speedup is achieved on the cost of accuracy, especially in the presence of correlated signals. Over the years it has been realized that biggest wins in low power design cannot come from circuit- and gate-level optimizations whereas architecture, system, and algorithm optimizations tend to have the largest impact on power consumption. Therefore, there has been a shift in the incline of the tool developers towards high-level analysis and optimization tools for power.

===Motivation===
It is well known that more significant power reductions are possible if optimizations are made on levels of abstraction, like the architectural and algorithmic level, which are higher than the circuit or gate level This provides the required motivation for the developers to focus on the development of new architectural level power analysis tools. This in no way implies that lower level tools are unimportant. Instead, each layer of tools provides a foundation upon which the next level can be built. The abstractions of the estimation techniques at a lower level can be used on a higher level with slight modifications.

===Advantages of doing power estimation at RTL or architectural level===
* Designers use a register-transfer level (RTL) description of the design to make optimizations and trade-offs very early in the design flow.
*The presence of functional blocks in an RTL description makes the complexity of architectural design much more manageable even for large chips because RTL has granularity sufficiently larger than gate- or circuit-level descriptions.

===Gate equivalents===
It is a technique based on the concept of gate equivalents. The complexity of a chip architecture can be described approximately in terms of gate equivalents where gate equivalent count specifies the average number of reference gates that are required to implement the particular function. The total power required for the particular function is estimated by multiplying the approximated number of gate equivalents with the average power consumed per gate. The reference gate can be any gate e.g. 2-input NAND gate.

====Examples of gate equivalent technique====
* Class-independent power modeling: It is a technique which tries to estimate chip area, speed, and power dissipation based on information about the complexity of the design in terms of gate equivalents. The functionality is divided among different blocks but no distinction is made about the functionality of the blocks i.e. it is basically class independent. This is the technique used by the &quot;chip estimation system&quot; (CES).
::Steps:
::# Identify the functional blocks such as counters, decoders, multipliers, memories, etc. 
::# Assign a complexity in terms of gate equivalents. The number of GE’s for each unit type are either taken directly as an input from the user or are fed from a library.

:formula_1
::Where Etyp is the assumed average dissipated energy by a gate equivalent, when active. The activity factor, Aint, denotes the average percentage of gates switching per clock cycle and is allowed to vary from function to function. The capacitive load, CL, is a combination of fan-out loading as well as wiring. An estimate of the average wire length can be used to calculate the wiring capacitance. This is provided by the user and cross-checked by using a derivative of Rent’s rule.

::Assumptions:
::# A single reference gate is taken as the basis for all the power estimates not taking into consideration different circuit styles, clocking strategies, or layout techniques.
::# The percentage of gates switching per clock cycle denoted by activity factors are assumed to be fixed regardless of the input patterns.
::# Typical gate switching energy is characterized by completely random uniform white noise (UWN) distribution of the input data. This implies that the power estimation is same regardless of the circuit being idle or at maximum load as this UWN model ignores how different input distributions affect the power consumption of gates and modules.

* Class-dependent power modeling: This approach is slightly better than the previous approach as it takes into account customized estimation techniques to the different types of functional blocks thus trying to increase the modelling accuracy which wasn’t the case in the previous technique such as logic, memory, interconnect, and clock hence the name. The power estimation is done in a very similar manner to the independent case. The basic switching energy is based on a three-input AND gate and is calculated from technology parameters e.g. gate width, tox, and metal width provided by the user.
:formula_2
::Where Cwire denotes the bit line wiring capacitance per unit length and Ccell denotes the loading due to a single cell hanging off the bit line. The clock capacitance is based on the assumption of an H-tree distribution network. Activity is modelled using a UWN model. As can be seen by the equation the power consumption of each components is related to the number of columns (Ncol) and rows (Nrow) in the memory array.

::Disadvantages:
::# The circuit activities are not modeled accurately as an overall activity factor is assumed for the entire chip which is also not trustable as provided by the user. As a matter of fact activity factors will vary throughout the chip hence this is not very accurate and prone to error. This leads to the problem that even if the model gives a correct estimate for the total power consumption by the chip, the module wise power distribution is fairly inaccurate.
::#The chosen activity factor gives the correct total power, but the breakdown of power into logic, clock, memory, etc. is less accurate. Therefore this tool is not much different or improved in comparison with CES.

===Precharacterized cell libraries===
This technique further customizes the power estimation of various functional blocks by having separate power model for logic, memory, and interconnect suggesting a power factor approximation (PFA) method for individually characterizing an entire library of functional blocks such as multipliers, adders, etc. instead of a single gate-equivalent model for “logic” blocks. 
The power over the entire chip is approximated by the expression:

:formula_3

Where Ki is PFA proportionality constant that characterizes the ith functional element formula_4 is the measure of hardware complexity, and formula_5 denotes the activation frequency.

====Example====
Gi denoting the hardware complexity of the multiplier is related to the square of the input word length i.e. N2 where N is the word length. The activation frequency is the rate at which multiplies are performed by the algorithm denoted by formula_6 and the PFA constant, formula_7, is extracted empirically from past multiplier designs and shown to be about 15 fW/bit2-Hz for a 1.2 μm technology at 5V.
The resulting power model for the multiplier on the basis of the above assumptions is:

formula_8
Advantages:
* Customization is possible in terms of whatever complexity parameters which are appropriate for that block. E.g. for a multiplier the square of the word length was appropriate. For memory, the storage capacity in bits is used and for the I/O drivers the word length alone is adequate.

Weakness: 
* There is the implicit assumption that the inputs do not affect the multiplier activity which is contradictory to the fact that the PFA constant formula_7 is intended to capture the intrinsic internal activity associated with the multiply operation as it is taken to be a constant.

The estimation error (relative to switch-level simulation) for a 16x16 multiplier is experimented and it is observed that when the dynamic range of the inputs does not fully occupy the word length of the multiplier, the UWN model becomes extremely inaccurate. Granted, good designers attempt to maximize word length utilization. Still, errors in the range of 50-100% are not uncommon. The figure clearly suggests a flaw in the UWN model.

<text>Alexander Zane Reed Lowe (born 1973) is a New Zealand radio DJ, live DJ, record producer, and television presenter. After an early career in music creation, production and DJing, he moved to the UK in 1997. He came to prominence through presenting on XFM and MTV Europe (MTV Two), developing a DJ career by opening sets for bands and eventually landing a slot on prime-time radio on BBC Radio 1 from 2003 to 2015. In 2015, he was hired by Apple to be the Creative Director of their new world-wide music station, Apple Music 1.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Born in Auckland, Lowe attended Auckland Grammar School and was a presenter on local music station Max TV. Zane was a member of Urban Disturbance, an early 90s hip hop group whose standout hit was &quot;No Flint No Flame&quot; and Breaks Co-Op, alongside Andy Lovegrove and Hamish Clark. Lowe and Clark formed Breaks Co-Op in Auckland, releasing the electronic album &quot;Roofers&quot; in 1997 before they both left New Zealand to travel and pursue other interests. Both would eventually develop their careers in the UK.

=== DJ ===

Lowe relocated to the UK in 1997. He initially worked at the Record and Tape Exchange in Notting Hill, before being asked to cover for a show on XFM, going on to host XFM&#x27;s Music Response. In 2003, he joined BBC Radio 1.

As a DJ, he has played sets at festivals including Coachella, Future Music Festival in Australia, Glastonbury, Creamfields and Bestival. He has toured with artists including, Skrillex, The Prodigy, Kasabian and The Weeknd and opened shows for both Muse and Foo Fighters at their concerts at Wembley Stadium. As well as being a regular performer at Ibiza and Mallorca Rocks, Lowe is also Musical Director for the brand.

=== MTV ===
Lowe started his career on MTV UK before moving to MTV2 Europe (now MTV Rocks) presenting shows such as &quot;MTV News&quot; (1998–2001), &quot;MTV News Daily Edition&quot; (1999–2001) and &quot;Brand:New&quot; (1999). From 2002 to 2015, he presented &quot;Gonzo&quot;, its flagship music show.

=== BBC Radio 1 ===
Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 evening show was broadcast from 2003 to 2015. The show developed a number of features including the &quot;Zane Lowe Meets&quot; interviews.

On 15 February 2015 it was announced that Lowe would be leaving BBC Radio 1 in March 2015 to launch a new station with Apple. Lowe presented his last show on 5 March 2015.

=== Apple Music 1 ===
At the 2015 Apple WWDC Keynote, Lowe was introduced as one of the DJs of Apple Music 1 (previously Beats 1), a radio station part of Apple Music. He was also the host of the Apple Music show &quot;Planet of the Apps&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
==Ryan Jarman incident==
Lowe saved Ryan Jarman&#x27;s life at the 2006 &quot;NME&quot; Awards, in an incident which &quot;NME&quot; referred to as &quot;engraved in indie folklore&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME 26/01/08&quot;&gt;NME 26/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; The incident occurred when Jarman&#x27;s band, the Cribs, accepted an award on behalf of winners Franz Ferdinand. While on his way to collect the trophy from presenter Russell Brand, Jarman fell onto the Kaiser Chiefs&#x27; table and pierced his back with broken glass, narrowly missing his vital organs. 

Jarman was taken to hospital but discharged himself to return for the show&#x27;s after-party later in the night. However, he fell unconscious in a back corridor. Lowe, a fellow guest at the party, found Jarman lying on the floor bleeding profusely and another ambulance was called which took Jarman to hospital where doctors stitched up the injuries.

<text>&quot;On Exactitude in Science&quot;, or &quot;On Rigor in Science&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Del rigor en la ciencia&quot;) is a one-paragraph short story by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.

==Plot==
The story, credited fictionally as a quotation from &quot;Suárez Miranda, &quot;Viajes de varones prudentes&quot;, Libro IV, Cap. XLV, Lérida, 1658&quot;, describes an empire where cartography becomes so exact that only a map on the same scale as the empire itself will suffice. Later generations come to disregard the map, however, and as it decays, so does the land and society beneath it.

==Publication history==
The story was first published in the March 1946 edition of &quot;Los Anales de Buenos Aires&quot; as part of a piece called &quot;Museo&quot; credited to &quot;B. Lynch Davis&quot;, a joint pseudonym of Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares. It was collected later that year in the 1946 second Argentinian edition of Borges&#x27; &quot;Historia universal de la infamia&quot; (&quot;A Universal History of Infamy&quot;).

The story is no longer included in current Spanish editions of the &quot;Historia universal de la infamia&quot;, as since 1961 it has appeared as part of Borges&#x27; collection &quot;El hacedor&quot;.

The names &quot;B. Lynch Davis&quot; and &quot;Suárez Miranda&quot; would be combined later in 1946 to form another pseudonym, B. Suárez Lynch, under which Borges and Bioy Casares published &quot;Un modelo para la muerte&quot;, a collection of detective fiction.

==Influences and legacy==
&quot;On Exactitude in Science&quot; elaborates on a concept in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Sylvie and Bruno Concluded&quot;: a fictional map that had &quot;the scale of a mile to the mile.&quot; One of Carroll&#x27;s characters notes some practical difficulties with this map and states that &quot;we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.&quot;

Italian writer Umberto Eco expanded upon the theme, quoting the story as the epigraph for his short story &quot;On the Impossibility of Drawing a Map of the Empire on a Scale of 1 to 1&quot;, collected in his &quot;How to Travel with a Salmon and Other Essays&quot;.

French philosopher Jean Baudrillard cited &quot;On Exactitude in Science&quot; as a predecessor to his concept of hyperreality in his 1981 treatise &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;.

<text>The Alfa Romeo 164 (Type 164) is a four-door executive saloon manufactured and marketed by Italian automaker Alfa Romeo from 1987 to 1998, styled by Pininfarina, and cooperatively designed and sharing platforms and numerous elements with the Fiat Croma, Saab 9000 and Lancia Thema. 

The 164 succeeded the Alfa Romeo 90 and Alfa 6. The 164 was followed by the 166 in 1998, after a combined production total of 273,857 units. 

The 164 was also the last Alfa Romeo officially sold in the United States until the 2015 launch of the Alfa Romeo Giulia. Alfa Romeo withdrew after the 1995 model year due to reliability concerns and slow sales.

==Development==
The 164 started life as &quot;Project 156&quot; (not to be confused with Alfa Romeo 156) in 1980 as a proposal by Alfa Romeo engineer Filippo Surace as a modular platform for a range of cars aimed to replace the Alfa Sud and Alfetta. Project 156 was meant to be a rear-wheel drive and powered by the Alfa Romeo&#x27;s &quot;Busso&quot; V6. A saloon body was designed by Centro Stile Alfa Romeo&#x27;s designer Ermanno Cressoni featuring a modern design language according to its times and a tail higher than the Alfetta. A year later, when the tooling and drivetrain development was underway, the Italian Government, which owned Alfa Romeo at the time, cut back the funding which resulted in the shelving of the project. Surace then engaged in talks with Lancia engineer Sergio Camuffo to discuss a joint venture in order to save development costs for a new model range. This joint development brought Alfa Romeo into the Fiat Tipo Quattro platform which was itself originally a joint development between Fiat and Saab tracing its roots to October 1978. 

Surace nonetheless utilized the existing tooling developed in house for Project 156 by modifying it to accommodate the front-wheel drive layout of the new platform while Cressoni&#x27;s team refined the design further to suit the new platform&#x27;s changed architecture. However, this time they had direct competition from renowned styling house Pininfarina. It was however, the latter&#x27;s design proposal styled by Enrico Fumia which gained the management&#x27;s approval in 1984 and was approved for production. However, early development mules of the car, now known as 164, utilized body panels made from the now cancelled Project 156 confusing spy photographers and journalists. Some design elements from Project 156 made their way to the Alfa Romeo 75.

The 164 featured a wedge shape yielding it a . The design would later influence the rest of the Alfa Romeo range (starting in 1990 with the major redesign of the 33 and culminating with the 155.

Ultimately unveiled at the 1987 Frankfurt Motor Show, the 164 was the last model to be developed while the Alfa Romeo was still a fully independent company, and was formally launched a few months after the takeover by Fiat.

==Design==
The 164 was styled by Enrico Fumia of Pininfarina, with the first 1:1 scale model produced in 1982. Design cues were publicly revealed on the Alfa Romeo Vivace concept car, which was exhibited at the 1986 Turin Motorshow that went on to influence the design of the Alfa Romeo GTV and Spider (916 series) launched in 1994.

The 164 became the first Alfa Romeo to benefit from extensive use of computer aided design, used to calculate structural stresses that resulted in a very rigid but still relatively lightweight chassis. Although sharing the same platform as that of the Lancia Thema, Fiat Croma and Saab 9000, by virtue of the fact that it was the last of the four to enter production, it featured unique front suspension geometry and the most distinctive styling of the lot. In fact, for example, the other cars all shared identical side door panels. Though still voluminous, the 164 had the tightest aperture to the rear boot, which had a 510-Litre capacity.

Overall, the 164 also benefitted from improved build quality relative to previous Alfa Romeos, due to the extensive use of galvanised steel for the chassis and various body panels for the first time in the brand&#x27;s history. Moreover, the car featured advanced (but troublesome) electronics due in-part to the most complex wiring harness fitted to any Alfa Romeo. For example: it had three onboard computers (one for air conditioning, one for instrumentation, and one for the engine management); air conditioning and instrument functions shared a multiple-mode coded Zilog Z80-class microcontroller for dashboard functioning). The instrumentation included a full range of gauges including an advanced check-panel.

The interior was spacious and modern, available with standard velour seating or a leather trim depending on the model. The dashboard continued the avantgarde design of the exterior with a centre console that was dominated by a large number of seemingly identical buttons arranged in rows. Air-direction within the ventilation system was controlled by a pair of servomechanisms, which used fragile plastic gears.

Depending on the model, the 164 featured automatic climate control and electronically controlled damping suspension - the latter, for example, in the sports-oriented &quot;Quadrifoglio Verde&quot; (&quot;Green Cloverleaf &quot;) and 164S models. This suspension actively reduced damping in response to conditions to provide a dynamic compromise between road holding and comfort.
==Range==
The 164 was only offered as a four-door saloon, unlike the related Type Four cars that were available in other bodystyles (i.e. Croma and 9000 hatchback; 9000 and Thema sedans; Thema wagon). In addition, until 1993, the 164 was only available in front wheel drive like the related cars.

The original 164 range launched in 1987 comprised the following models:
* 2.0i Twin Spark (badged &quot;T.SPARK&quot;)
* 2.0 Turbo (four-cylinder, Italian market only)
* 3.0i V6 12-valve
* 2.5 Turbodiesel (badged &quot;TD&quot;).

European export versions were fitted with catalytic converters to meet more stringent emission standards, including the Twin Spark Europa model.

In 1990, the range was expanded by the sports-oriented 3.0i V6 &quot;Quadrifoglio Verde&quot; (badged &quot;QV&quot; or &quot;S&quot;). In early 1991, the turbocharged four-cylinder &quot;tax special&quot; version was replaced by a turbocharged, 2-liter V6 with more power. North American export versions were new for the 1991 model year; this range included the luxury-oriented 164 L (&quot;L&quot; for Lusso in Italian) equipped with the 3.0-litre V6 rated at and of torque and the 164 S (in essence, the &quot;QV&quot;) with an uprated and .

Apart from minor running production upgrades, the range was revamped and became known as the &quot;164 Super&quot; in 1993. Key differences on the outside consisted of chrome trimmings added to the upper edge of the bumpers bars and revised headlights now with a slimmer profile. Inside, there were revised instruments and a centre console that featured more delineated switchgear.

The range was now also bolstered by the following models:
* 3.0i V6 24V with a 24-valve engine upgrade
* 3.0i V6 &quot;Quadrifoglio 4&quot; (badged &quot;Q4&quot;), which was the most powerful and sole all wheel drive variant built.

In the North American market, the new 24-valve version of the 3.0L V6 was rated at and of torque in LS trim while the S model developed and . The 3.0-litre V6 was the only engine ever offered there, and 1995 would prove to be the last year an Alfa Romeo sedan would be sold there until the 2017 model year.
The 164 was rebadged as the 168 for the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Malaysian markets, as the number &quot;164&quot; had a very negative connotation (一路死 — a Chinese homophone meaning &quot;all the way to death&quot;), and &quot;168&quot; has quite the opposite meaning (一路發 — &quot;all the way to prosperity&quot;).

===Quadrifoglio Verde===
The 164 QV or &quot;Quadrifoglio Verde&quot; was available from 1990 to 1992 as the top of the range model. It was fitted with a bodykit that comprised an extended front spoiler, deeper side-skirts and a deeper rear apron. Inside, the QV featured sculpted sports seats whereas, mechanically, it was fitted with an up-rated version of the 3.0-litre V6 12-valve engine and adjustable damper settings. The engine sat lower, while the suspension was dropped by . The added power, up from , was the result of sharper cams, an increased compression ratio, and polished inlets and exhaust. In some markets, like Australia, this was the only 164 available with a manual transmission. From 1992, this model was powered by the new 24-valve V6 engine.

===Q4===
In 1993, Alfa Romeo introduced a four-wheel drive variant called the Q4 (short for &quot;Quadrifoglio 4&quot;), which was equipped with the most powerful 3.0-Litre V6 engine fitted to the 164, featuring 24-valves. The Q4&#x27;s four-wheel-drive system (&quot;Viscomatic&quot;) was co-developed with the Austrian company Steyr-Daimler-Puch. and was more advanced than other systems offered at the time. The system consisted of a viscous coupling unit, central epicyclic differential and Torsen differential in the rear. Connected to the ABS and &quot;Motronic&quot; engine management modules, the power driven to the rear axle was continuously variable from 0 to 100% subject to road conditions. Torque was distributed between axles depending on the speed, turning radius, engine rpm, throttle position and ABS parametrics. This model was equipped with a Getrag 6-speed manual gearbox.
==Engines==

The base 164 engine was the 2.0 L Twin Spark inline-four engine with two spark plugs per cylinder. Apart from that, this engine was also notable for having a two-stage valve timing system (before Honda&#x27;s VTEC), and an induction valve blade-type system, both aimed at improving low-end torque.

The block of the Twin Spark was the same 2.0 L that had been a part of Alfa&#x27;s road and race car history since the 1930s. The engine featured fuel injection, controlled by a Bosch Motronic system as well as a chain-driven DOHC cylinder head, a single cooling fan and generator belt, improved reliability and reduced parasitic friction. The battery of all 164s was placed in the trunk to achieve a near 50:50 weight distribution.

Next was a turbocharged 2.0 L eight-valve engine, derived from the Lancia Thema i.e. Turbo including an overboost feature. This was later replaced by a turbocharged 2.0 L V6, which was based on the 3.0 L engine and was fitted with a very sophisticated engine management system from Bosch.

The top-of-the-line engine was the 3.0 L &quot;Busso&quot; V6 designed by Giuseppe Busso originally for the Alfa 6. Its 12-valve design was later upgraded to 24-valves for the new V6 models and, specifically, the QV and Q4.

For Europe, there was also a turbodiesel version with an engine sourced from the Italian engine maker VM Motori. Rated at , with this engine, the 164 had a top speed of .

A 2.0 L V6 turbocharged engine was intended for the domestic market, due to an Italian law at the time under which cars with engine displacement over 2000 cc had a value-added tax of 38% instead of the usual 18%.

===Performance===


==Concept cars and variants==
In 1991, a shortened version of the 164 platform served as the basis of the all-wheel drive Alfa Romeo Proteo concept, which never eventuated.

The 164 also served as the basis of the Italdesign Scighera concept sports car unveiled in 1997. The Scighera sported the same 3.0-liter engine as the 164 but with 2 turbochargers.

In 1988, Alfa Romeo produced the 164 Pro-Car featuring a mid-engine layout and powered by the Alfa Romeo V1035 3.5-litre V10 engine. This unusual powerplant was originally planned to be used by the Ligier F1 team and was rated at at 13,300 rpm and of torque at 9,500 rpm. Weighing only , the 164 Pro-Car achieved a top speed of and had a quarter mile time of 9.7 seconds. It was planned to race in a special racing series, as a support event to Formula One Grand Prix. With Alfa Romeo being the only manufacturer to produce a car for this series, the project was ultimately cancelled. Only one rolling chassis with the Alfa Romeo V10 was built by Motor Racing Developments Ltd., the company behind the Brabham Formula One team, which was owned by Alfa Romeo at the time. 
A 2-door &quot;Vigili del Fuoco&quot; (Italian for fire brigade) pick-up version now exhibited at the Alfa Romeo Museum, was produced as part of the brand&#x27;s practice of supplying specially modified vehicles for use by rescue teams at racing tracks.

<text>Vito John Fossella Jr. (born March 9, 1965) is an American politician serving as the Staten Island Borough President since 2022. A member of the Republican Party, Fossella previously represented the state&#x27;s 13th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives for six terms, from 1997 to 2009 serving as the lone Republican from New York City. A Staten Island native, Fossella initially took office in 1997 after winning a special election held to replace the resigning Susan Molinari.

After a DUI arrest in Alexandria, Virginia on May 1, 2008, it was discovered that he was living with Laura Fay, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel, while Fossella was married. The two had a child together and lived in Virginia as a married couple while he lived in Staten Island with his wife. He announced on his official website on May 20 that he had chosen to serve out the remainder of his term, which ended on January 3, 2009, but decided not to run for re-election.

In November 2021, Fosella was elected borough president of Staten Island.

== Early life, education, and family ==
Fossella was born on Staten Island into a Roman Catholic family of Irish and Italian descent. Fossella&#x27;s great-grandfather James A. O&#x27;Leary represented Staten Island in Congress from 1935 to 1944. One of his uncles, Frank Fossella, was a prominent Staten Island Democrat who was a City Council member in 1985. His father, Vito John Fossella Sr., served in various appointed positions in the city administrations of Democratic Mayors Ed Koch and Abraham Beame, then became a successful construction engineer.

Fossella, the fourth of seven children, was a basketball player at Monsignor Farrell High School, where he got his first political experience in the student council. He briefly played violin and percussion with the Christian pop band Sonseed. He attended Iona College in New Rochelle, then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1987. At Penn, he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.

After college, Fossella worked as a management consultant at the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was the second largest campaign contributor to Fossella in the 2006 campaign cycle and among the largest contributors in the 2008 campaign cycle.

Fossella then attended law school. He received a Juris Doctor from the Fordham University School of Law in 1993 and worked as an associate at a medical malpractice defense law firm Schiavetti Begos &amp; Nicholson.

In 1990, Fossella married Mary Patricia Rowan. They have three children and live in the Great Kills neighborhood on Staten Island. Fossella also had a daughter out-of-wedlock in 2005 with retired Lt. Col. Laura Fay.

== New York City Council ==

=== Early political work; election ===
Fossella was a political protégé of Michael J. Petrides, a city school board member and a Staten Island political strategist. In 1990, Fossella changed his voter registration from the Democratic Party to become the family&#x27;s first Republican. &quot;I found myself voting more and more for Republicans,&quot; he said in 1997. &quot;For the most part, my family reacted well. But still, I would love to have been a fly on the wall.&quot; Under Petrides&#x27; guidance, he joined the 1992 re-election campaign of Staten Island Congresswoman Susan Molinari and, in 1993, the mayoral campaign of Rudy Giuliani.

Fossella&#x27;s political career began in April 1994, when he won a special election to the New York City Council, representing Staten Island&#x27;s South Shore and Mid-Island section. He replaced Councilman Alfred C. Cerullo III, who had left to become Commissioner of Consumer Affairs in the Rudy Giuliani administration. Fossella spent $92,000 in the election, in which he had five opponents.

In November 1994, Fossella was reelected to the remaining three years of Cerullo&#x27;s term, defeating Democrat Rosemarie Mangano. He served on the Council until November 1997.

=== Council initiatives ===
Fossella&#x27;s council initiatives included:

* Authoring the legislation that led to the agreement to close the Fresh Kills Landfill permanently
* Conceiving the idea of the South Richmond Rezoning Study, a comprehensive rezoning initiative on Staten Island
* Securing funding for constructing P.S. 56 and P.S. 6, the first new schools built on Staten Island in over a decade.

==United States Congress ==

=== Initial election ===
In June 1997, Fossella was selected by executive committee of the Staten Island Republican Party as its candidate to run for the Congressional seat being vacated by Representative Susan Molinari. 
Fossella won the special election in November 1997, defeating Democratic Assemblyman Eric Vitaliano with 61 percent of the vote.
=== Re-elections ===
In November 1998, Fossella won a full term with 68 percent of the vote. He was reelected in 2000, winning 65 percent of the vote against Democrat Katina M. Johnstone even as Al Gore carried the district. In 2002, he was reelected with 70 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Arne M. Mattsson.
In 2004, Fossella faced his first close contest against former state assemblyman and judge Frank J. Barbaro. Barbaro won the Brooklyn portion of the district by seven points, the first time Fossella had not won that area; Barbaro had represented much of this area in Albany for 23 years. However, Barbaro performed poorly on Staten Island, and Fossella won by 26 points—enough to win a fourth full term with 59% of the vote districtwide. Some have speculated that he was helped by George W. Bush&#x27;s 13-point win on Staten Island.

Fossella was considered a possible challenger to Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the 2005 election, but he chose not to make the race.

In 2006, incumbent Fossella defeated Democrat Steve Harrison, a relatively unknown Brooklyn attorney, by a margin of 56.7%-43.3%.

=== Family scandal and congressional retirement ===
Before Fossella announced that he would not run in 2008, he was included in the National Republican Congressional Committee&#x27;s list of Republican candidates who qualified for fundraising help because they were considered particularly vulnerable.

Steve Harrison hoped to run against Fossella again in the 2008 election, but New York City Council member Domenic Recchia also began seeking the Democratic nomination.

Fossella became mired in controversy in May 2008. He was, first, arrested in Alexandria, Virginia. Details of his arrest led to the revelation that Fossella, a self-proclaimed &quot;family values&quot; politician, had kept a secret second family in Washington, D.C., including a three-year old child that he had fathered out-of-wedlock. Fossella, at first, indicated that he might run for re-election despite these problems. On May 20, however, he dropped out of the race. Fossella was succeeded by Democrat Michael McMahon.

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection
** Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials
** Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet

=== Political positions ===
In August 2002, appearing on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, Fossella argued for partly privatizing Social Security and allowing some of the funds to be placed on Wall Street investments. He said, &quot;I happen to think the President is on the right side of history here. And I think the more you empower American people, the more you give them the opportunity to invest on their own and being in control of their own destiny and their own retirement, the better off we&#x27;ll be.&quot;

In June 2003, Fossella wrote an op-ed for the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, in which he said, &quot;The claims that progress is too slow, the situation unstable and the United States lacks the expertise to get the job done does not reflect reality on the ground in Baghdad, Kirkuk and beyond. Indeed, the critics who complain that the seeds of democracy will not take root in the sands of a desert where tyranny ruled are as wrong today as the pessimists were in 1945.&quot; The final sentence of the column was, &quot;The United States will fulfill its commitment to Iraq, and then we will depart, having liberated a nation, freed a people and established a democracy of the people, by the people and for the people.&quot; In August 2006, Fossella said that leaving Iraq now would &quot;do a disservice to the noble sacrifice that the troops have made on behalf of our national security.&quot;

Fossella voted for the Marriage Protection Act in 2004 and for the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004 and 2006, all of which would nationally define marriage as between a man and a woman. In 2007, Fossella voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill nationally prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation.

In 2005, Fossella spoke out against the Bush Administration&#x27;s handling of appropriating Homeland Security funds.

After the 2007 State of the Union Address, Fossella crossed the aisle to join with Senator Hillary Clinton in 2007 to raise awareness of health issues suffered by those who worked at the World Trade Center site on and after 9/11. Fossella said, &quot;We have made progress over the last year to begin getting the resources necessary to help our 9/11 heroes. However, we now need a significant investment by the federal government into health monitoring and treatment for those who are sick or injured. In addition, the federal government must develop a comprehensive plan to address the health impacts of 9/11. We continue urging the White House to provide adequate funding in the 2008 budget to help all those who are sick or injured as a result of the terror attacks.&quot;

=== Legislative initiatives ===
Fossella&#x27;s legislative initiatives while in Congress included the following:

* Return over $700 million to individual investors by eliminating fees by the SEC with the Investor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act. The Act was signed into law by President Bush on January 16, 2002.

<text>The Nymphenburg Palace (, Palace of the Nymphs) is a Baroque palace situated in Munich&#x27;s western district Neuhausen-Nymphenburg, in Bavaria, southern Germany. The Nymphenburg served as the main summer residence for the former rulers of Bavaria of the House of Wittelsbach. Combined with the adjacent Nymphenburg Palace Park it constitutes one of the premier royal palaces of Europe. Its frontal width of (north–south axis) even surpasses Versailles.

==History==
===Building history===

The palace was commissioned by the electoral couple Ferdinand Maria and Henriette Adelaide of Savoy to the designs of the Italian architect Agostino Barelli in 1664 after the birth of their son Maximilian II Emanuel. The central pavilion was completed in 1675. As a building material, it utilised limestone from Kelheim. The palace was gradually expanded and transformed over the years. It then quickly replaced the nearby Blutenburg Castle as major hunting lodge of the court and competed to Schleissheim Palace.

Starting in 1701, Maximilian Emanuel, the heir to Bavaria, a sovereign electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, undertook a systematic extension of the palace. Two pavilions were added each in the south and north of Barelli&#x27;s palace by Enrico Zucalli and Giovanni Antonio Viscardi and were connected with the centre pavilion by two gallery wings. In 1716, Joseph Effner redesigned the facade of the centre pavilion in French Baroque style with pilasters. Later, the south section of the palace was further extended to build the court stables (1719). For the sake of balance, the orangery building was added to the north which was only completed in 1758. Finally, Nymphenburg Palace was completed with a grand circle (the &quot;Schlossrondell&quot;) of Baroque mansions (the so-called Kavaliershäuschen – cavalier&#x27;s lodges), erected under Maximilian Emanuel&#x27;s son Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII Albert in the palace&#x27;s driveway. His son Prince-Elector Maximilian III founded the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory in 1747, to this day housed in one of these cavalier&#x27;s lodges. Its fashionable Rococo products by porcelain sculptors Franz Anton Bustelli and Dominik Auliczek made the name &quot;Nymphenburg&quot; widely known.
In 1795, Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria ordered the widening of the galleries on the park side. In 1826, under King Ludwig I of Bavaria, his architect Leo von Klenze removed the gables of the main pavilion with the Electoral coat of arms and created an attic style decoration directly under the roof instead.
===Residence===
With the Treaty of Nymphenburg signed in July 1741, Charles Albert allied with France and Spain against Austria. Two of his children were born here: Maria Antonia (future Electress of Saxony) in 1724 and Maria Anna Josepha (future Margravine of Baden-Baden) in 1734. Charles Albert lived during his time in Munich as Holy Roman Emperor at Nymphenburg Palace and died there in 1745. In 1747, Elector Max III. Joseph founded the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory. In 1792, Elector Charles Theodor opened the park for the public.

For a long time, the palace was the favourite summer residence of the rulers of Bavaria. King Max I Joseph died there in 1825 and his great-grandson King Ludwig II was born there in 1845. In 1863, the only meeting between Ludwig and Otto von Bismarck was held in Nymphenburg, although they remained connected in a lifelong friendship.

Today, Nymphenburg is open to the public but also continues to be a home and chancery for the head of the House of Wittelsbach, currently Franz, Duke of Bavaria. It is managed by Kempinski Hotels.

==Palace==
The palace, together with its park, is now one of the most famous sights of Munich. The baroque facades comprise an overall width of about 700 metres. Some rooms still show their original baroque decoration while others were later redesigned in rococo or neoclassical style.

===Central pavilion===
The &quot;Steinerner Saal&quot; (Stone Hall) in the &quot;central pavilion&quot;, with ceiling frescoes by Johann Baptist Zimmermann and F. Zimmermann and decorations by François de Cuvilliés, is an impressive sight. Acting as a grand hall, it occupies over three floors of the central pavilion of the palace. The central ceiling fresco is Helios in his chariot, accompanied by other gods.
North of the Stone Hall, there is the wood-panelled antechamber, the audience chamber decorated with Brussels tapestries and the former bedroom with the so-called &quot;Little Beauty Gallery&quot; with the ladies of Versailles, all rooms were remodelled under Maximilian II Emanuel in the style of the Régence but retain their original Baroque ceilings. Here are on display portraits of the elector and his wife Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska. The bedroom closes the park side, next to it is the &quot;Drechsel Cabinet&quot; (turnery cabinet) of Maximilian III Joseph, designed by François de Cuvilliés. Three rooms further to the north were created under Charles Theodore with the widening of the gallery wing. In the first room there are now more portraits of ladies from the &quot;Great Gallery of Beauties&quot; of Max Emanuel, the second one is decorated with a pile rug with the coats of arms of Bavaria and the Palatinate (known as &quot;coat of arms room&quot;), while the third room contains portraits of Charles Theodore and both his consorts Elisabeth Auguste and Maria Leopoldine.
South of the Stone Hall are inversely to the northern rooms of the main building, the hall with the portrait of Charles Albert, the audience room with the portrait of the founding couple Ferdinand Maria and his consort Henriette Adelaide and the Former Bedroom with portraits of Max Emanuel and his consort Theresa Kunegunda. Here too, the original Baroque ceilings have survived. The walls of the so-called &quot;lacquer cabinet&quot; that adjoins the bedroom are almost completely covered with Chinese panels showing scenes from a Chinese novel. The stucco was done by Franz Xaver Feuchtmayer the Younger. Behind the south gallery are the &quot;Writing Cabinet&quot; and &quot;Antechamber&quot; of Elector Charles Theodore, which were created with the widening of the gallery wings.

In both the North and South Galleries next to the &quot;Central Pavilion&quot; are vedutes of Bavarian castles. These galleries connect the central pavilion with the southern and northern pavilions.

===Southern pavilions and wings===
The Inner southern Pavilion housed the apartments of the Electress during the period of its origin. The former small dining room of the Inner Southern Pavilion today houses the famous attraction &quot;Gallery of Beauties&quot; of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. On behalf of the king the court painter Joseph Karl Stieler has portrayed 36 beautiful women from all social classes of Munich, the best known of these are the shoemaker&#x27;s daughter Helene Sedlmayr and Ludwig&#x27;s infamous mistress Lola Montez. In the nearby &quot;Queen&#x27;s bedroom&quot; one can see where King Ludwig II of Bavaria was born on 25 August 1845. Its mahogany furniture was made in 1815 in Munich, unlike the mahogany furniture for Queen Caroline&#x27;s &quot;audience room&quot; which was made in Paris, as was the furniture in the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Study&quot;.

The Outer Southern Pavilion is generally inaccessible. It served as a kitchen building at Max Emanuel&#x27;s time and was then reconstructed like the inner pavilion in neo-classical times. Further south, the third pavilion was built as a &quot;comedihaus&quot; and then served from 1750 as a new kitchen house. The &quot;southern corridor&quot; built in 1747 connects this building with the stables in the south wing.

In the former royal stables in the South Wing is the Marstallmuseum (carriage museum), with one of the greatest coach collections in Europe. They also played a part in historical events - the Paris Coronation Coach for example was used for the coronation of Emperor Charles VII in 1742. Among the main attractions of the museum are the magnificent carriages and sleighs of King Ludwig II.

The first floor of the former court stables houses a collection of &quot;Nymphenburg porcelain&quot; by the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory which, also located in the palace complex, was founded by Maximilian III Joseph. Its handcrafted products are of legendary kind and quality, nowadays said to be comparable only to Augarten and Sèvres. Over 1,000 exhibits, beginning in 1747, are on display. The Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory itself is located in one of the houses of the northern roundabouts and can be visited only by written appointment. In the adjoining Outer South Wing of the castle is a restaurant with beer garden.

===Northern pavilions and wings===
The Inner Northern Pavilion, the later so-called &quot;Crown Prince Building&quot;, is generally inaccessible. Here was Max Emanuel&#x27;s &quot;appartement de parade&quot; and its representative rooms are today used by the &quot;Wittelsbach Compensation Fund&quot;. The upper floors serve as living quarters for the respective head of the House of Wittelsbach. The Outer Northern Pavilion houses the chapel, whose ceiling painting by Joseph Adam von Mölk deals with the life of St Mary Magdalene. It was already begun in 1702 by Antonio Viscardi from the design by Enrico Zuccalli. Further north is the third pavilion, the &quot;Gardemeublebau&quot; from 1723, an elongated building which served during the period of its origin for the Cue sports and the &quot;Jeu de Passe&quot;, a ball game inspired by Pall-mall, which was invented by Max Emanuel himself and was played indoors and outdoors. Today the Duke of Bavaria&#x27;s administration is located here. It is connected to the north wing by the &quot;northern corridor&quot; of 1739.

Since 1990, the &quot;Museum of Man and Nature&quot; has been housed in the North Wing. The &quot;Hubertus Hall&quot; upstairs served for concerts. Today the Hubertus Hall, the Orangery Hall, and the Johannis Hall in the North Wing as well as the Iron House in the park can be booked for parties, concerts, conferences and other functions. From 1835 the Mary Ward Elementary School was in the adjoining Outer North Wing of the castle. Founded by Mary Ward, it paved the way for a better education for girls. Mary Ward came after travelling from Rome to Munich in 1627 and was sponsored by Elector Maximilian I. King Ludwig I finally invited the girls&#x27; school to the Nymphenburg Palace in 1835.

==Park==

===Garden structure===
The park, once an Italian garden (1671), which was enlarged and rearranged in French style by Dominique Girard, a pupil of Le Notre, was finally redone in the English manner during the early 19th century by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, on behalf of prince-elector Charles Theodore. Von Sckell was also the creator of the English Garden in Munich. He preserved the main elements of the Baroque garden (such as the &quot;Grand Parterre&quot;). The park is bisected by the long western canal along the principal axis which leads from the palace to the marble cascade (decorated with stone figures of Greek and Roman gods) in the west. The iron greenhouse north of the Grand Parterre was completed in 1807, the adjacent geranium house in 1816.
The garden parterre is still a visible feature of the French garden. As part of the transformation of the entire castle grounds by Sckell it was simplified, but retained its original size. The &quot;Grand Cascade&quot; was built by Joseph Effner in 1717. He was referring to a concept of François Roëttiers. The water falls in the middle of a two-part water staircase, the first stage being half round to the west, the second, deeper, is formed to the east. The cascade consists of symmetry which continues through the centre channel. The right side of the cataract was covered with pink marble in 1770. Originally a supporting architecture was to be provided, which was never executed. Instead, from 1775 to 1785, sculptures were added. Many were the work of Dominik Auliczek and Roman Anton Boos, who later added twelve decorative marble vases with mythological themes.

The fountains in front of the palace and in the garden &quot;parterre&quot; continue to be operated by the water powered Pumping Stations built between 1803 and 1808.

The Northern Cabinet Garden is small garden that borders directly the garden side of the north wing of the main palace. It is also called &quot;Kaisergarten&quot;, because it is in the immediate vicinity of the rooms where Charles Albert lived during his time in Munich as Emperor Charles VII. It has its counterpart in the Southern Cabinet Garden where François de Cuvilliés built an octagonal bird house in 1757.

Two lakes are situated on both sides of the canal. The &quot;Dörfchen&quot; was created under Maximilian III Joseph as Petit hameau. The &quot;Salettl&quot; (1799), a cottage with its little garden nearby close to the former menagerie served as attraction for the children of Maximilian IV Joseph.

The garden wall (1730–1735) preserves several Ha-ha effects. A passage close to the old arboretum in the north of the Grand Parterre leads to the large &quot;Botanical Garden&quot; of Munich. Originally there was also a visual axis, the &quot;Durchblick&quot;, to the north-west-located Blutenburg Castle.

The canals of Nymphenburg are part of the northern Munich channel system, a system of waterways that connected also to the complex of Schleissheim Palace. The endpoint of the eastern canal leading from the city to the palace forms the Cour d&#x27;honneur, the centre was designed by Effner as a water parterre with a fountain, cascade and branching canals on both sides. The driveway (&quot;Auffahrtsallee&quot;) from the city on both sides of the eastern canal is framed by a semicircle of smaller baroque buildings (&quot;Kavalierhäuser&quot;) at the Cour d&#x27;honneur. The eastern endpoint of the canal is the &quot;Hubertusbrunnen&quot; (1903, a fountain building by Adolf von Hildebrand).

===Garden pavilions===

Within the park, a number of pavilions - palaces en miniature - were built:
* The Pagodenburg (1716–1719) – an octagonal, two-story pavilion with Delft tile decoration downstairs and Chinoiserie upstairs. It was built by Joseph Effner as &quot;maison de plaisance&quot; and tea house. 
* The Badenburg (1719–1721) – a Baroque pavilion also by Joseph Effner. It served for the private bathing and contains several rooms including a grand banqueting hall with a festive ornament decor by Charles Dubut and a very large tiled bath with a pool. The dressing room is decorated with various Chinese printed wallpapers. In the Monkey Cabinet the Elector performed his toilette. It was the first major building in Europe for centuries that was exclusively for the purpose of enjoying a comfortable bathroom.
* The Magdalenenklause – a faux ruin for retreat and meditation, erected between 1725 and 1728. The building with its prayer room is considered as an early representative of the hermitage and the ruins of architecture in Germany; it was to serve Max Emanuel as a place of contemplation - a memento mori, whose completion the elector however did not longer witness.
* The Amalienburg – a Rococo hunting lodge constructed in 1734–1739 by François de Cuvilliés for Charles Albert and his wife, Maria Amalia of Austria, including a hall of mirrors (designed by Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Joachim Dietrich) and a kennel room for the hunting dogs. The building with its decoration is a definite masterpiece at the climax of European rococo.
* The Apollotemple – a neoclassical monopteros temple by Leo von Klenze, erected in 1862–1865.

The architecture of the garden pavilions was influential for other architecture in Germany. So the Wittelsbach Falkenlust Palace was built in the style of the Amalienburg while the Pagodenburg served as prototype for the building of the same name in Rastatt.

==Tourism==

The main building alone has more than 300,000 visitors per year. Nymphenburg Palace has as many visitors as the Munich Residence and more than Schleissheim Palace, though the castles of King Ludwig II, especially Neuschwanstein, are more frequented.

Museums:
* Schlossmuseum (Royal apartments: Central pavilion, North and South Galleries, Inner Southern Pavilion, Garden pavilions)
* Marstallmuseum (Carriage Museum: South wing)
* Porzellanmuseum München (Nymphenburg porcelain museum: South wing)
* Museum of Man and Nature (North wing)
* Erwin von Kreibig-Museum (South Schlossrondell)

Schloss Nymphenburg is accessible by Munich public transport&#x27;s tram number 17. This line passes through the city centre, including Stachus and the main train station.

==Miscellaneous==
Between 1936 and 1939 open air events called &quot;Nacht der Amazonen&quot; (Night of the Amazons) were performed. These shows in the park comprised 2000 players with international stars, bare-breasted girls and included also members of the SS Cavalry under Hermann Fegelein.

The palace and its park were some of the main filming locations of Alain Resnais&#x27;s 1961 movie &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;. &quot;Ludwig&quot;, a 1972 film directed by Italian director Luchino Visconti about the life and death of King Ludwig II, was partly filmed in Nymphenburg.

The Dressage Facility for the equestrian events of the 1972 Summer Olympics was created in the Nymphenburg park.

The palace serves also as headquarters of the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes.

<text>The Red line is a metro line of Kaohsiung Metro which runs north–south through the city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. At , it is the fourth-longest metro line in Taiwan, after Taoyuan Airport MRT, Tamsui-Xinyi Line and Zhonghe-Xinlu Line.

There is a plan to extend the line north to Hunei District. This would add 8 stations to the line.

==History==
In the “1988 Kaohsiung Metropolitan Metro System Feasibility Study”, the Red line was amongst the four lines planned. In January 1991, it was one of the two lines categorised to open as Phase 1 in period 1. Further progress was halted in March 1995 due to skepticism for the need of it within the city council, citing traffic congestion within the city to be not critical. In June 1998, the Executive board revived the plans under the BOT initiative. Together with the approval from relevant city councils, the metro department began conducting feasibility studies of the Red Line in February 1999. Three months later, priority was given to China Steel Corporation and Siemens on construction contracts. The contracts were finalised in January 2000.

On 24 October 2001, ground works were initiated at the Siaogang station site. The first phase from Siaogang station to Sanduo Shopping District station had its machinery and tunneling works completed in November 2006. Test riders were invited for operational trial for this milestone. By February 2008, most of the construction had been completed. At this stage, a soft opening was launched with free rides in the first phase. The entire line from Siaogang to Ciaotou stations opened on 9 March 2008, and was free to commuters until 7 April the same year.

It opened for service on 9 March 2008 and was free for one month until 6 April.

The new EMUs for the six expanded stations will be manufactured by South Korea&#x27;s Hyundai Rotem and Singapore&#x27;s ST Engineering.

<doc id="963099" wikidata="Q3194868" url="?curid=963099" title="Kellen Winslow II">
<text>Kellen Boswell Winslow II (born July 21, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a tight end in the National Football League (NFL). Playing college football for the Miami Hurricanes, he earned unanimous All-American honors and recognition as the top college tight end in 2003. He won a BCS national championship with Miami in 2001.

Winslow announced his eligibility for the 2004 NFL draft and was selected by the Cleveland Browns with the sixth overall pick. He played four seasons for the Browns and was named to the Pro Bowl in 2007. He also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New England Patriots, and New York Jets. Winslow last played in the NFL in 2013, but attempted comebacks in 2017 and 2018. In 2019, he was convicted of rape and sexual battery.

==Early life==
Winslow was born in San Diego, California, the son of San Diego Chargers tight end Kellen Winslow, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He attended Patrick Henry High School, in San Diego, for his freshmen and sophomore years of high school and Scripps Ranch High School for his junior and senior years.

==College career==
Winslow enrolled at the University of Miami, where he played for coach Larry Coker&#x27;s Miami Hurricanes football team from 2001 to 2003.

During his freshman season, in 2001, he backed up All-American tight end Jeremy Shockey and played largely on special teams, and was one of four true freshmen to play for the Hurricanes&#x27; 2001 BCS National Championship team; the three others were future NFL players Frank Gore, Antrel Rolle, and Sean Taylor.

After Shockey&#x27;s departure for the 2002 NFL draft, Winslow became the starter at tight end and was named a finalist for the Mackey Award and named a first-team All-American by CNNSI.com, setting University of Miami records for a tight end with 57 receptions for 726 yards and eight touchdowns. His best game came during the 2003 Fiesta Bowl, which was the site of the BCS National Championship game that year, in which he caught 11 passes for 122 yards and one touchdown in the Hurricanes 31–24 loss to Ohio State Buckeyes.

===&quot;I&#x27;m a Soldier&quot; controversy===
Winslow received national attention following a 2003 University of Miami game with the Tennessee Volunteers. Eighteenth-ranked Tennessee defeated 6 Miami on the Hurricanes home field by a score of 10–6. During a sweep play for Miami wide receiver/cornerback Devin Hester, Winslow blocked two Volunteers, effectively taking both defenders out of the play. When questioned during the media session following the game, Winslow referred to himself as &quot;a soldier&quot;, despite never serving in the military. He later apologized for the remarks.

Despite a slight drop in production during his junior season, in which Winslow caught 60 passes for 605 yards and one touchdown, he won the John Mackey Award as the nation&#x27;s best collegiate tight end, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American, after receiving first-team honors from the Associated Press and other national selector organizations. After the season, Winslow decided to forgo his senior season and declared himself eligible for the 2004 NFL draft.

==Professional career==
===Cleveland Browns===
Winslow was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the sixth pick in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft, making him the highest-selected tight end in more than 30 years. Cleveland head coach Butch Davis was also the coach who recruited Winslow to the University of Miami before leaving for the NFL prior to ever coaching Winslow in college.

====2004 leg injury====
Winslow was expected to give the Cleveland offense an immediate boost. Two games into his rookie season, however, he suffered a broken right fibula, which cost him $5.3 million in incentive bonuses. The injury kept him on the sidelines for the remainder of the year after having only recorded five catches for 50 yards. After two operations on the injured leg, Winslow made a complete recovery.

====2005 motorcycle accident====
On May 1, 2005, Winslow suffered another leg injury when he was thrown from his Suzuki GSX-R750 motorcycle while riding in the Cleveland suburb of Westlake. Winslow sustained a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and was placed on the &quot;Physically Unable-to-Perform (Non Football Injury)&quot; list for the 2005 season. Winslow later had a six-week staph infection that resulted from the injury.

====2006 season====
Winslow attended the Browns&#x27; 2006 training camp and pronounced himself ready to play. The Associated Press reported in August 2006 that Winslow said that, even at 90 percent, he was superior to every other NFL tight end. &quot;I hate to be brash&quot;, Winslow said. &quot;But I think my 90 percent is still better than every tight end out there.&quot;

In the opening game of the 2006 NFL season against the New Orleans Saints, Winslow recorded his first NFL touchdown, scoring on an 18-yard pass from quarterback Charlie Frye. Winslow emerged as a reliable target for Cleveland, finishing the year with 89 receptions, the most at his position on the season, which also tied Ozzie Newsome&#x27;s all-time franchise record for receptions in a season. Winslow underwent microfracture surgery on his right knee January 31, 2007, at the Cleveland Clinic in an attempt to further repair cartilage damage sustained in the motorcycle accident in 2005.

====2007 season====
Winslow had a successful season and finished with 82 receptions for 1,106 yards and five touchdowns. On December 18, Winslow was named as a first alternate for the 2008 Pro Bowl. On February 4, Antonio Gates of the San Diego Chargers announced he would not be attending the Pro Bowl due to injury. This paved the way for Winslow to make his first trip to the Pro Bowl. Winslow was one of 6 Browns selected for the Pro Bowl that season.

The Browns also had their most successful season in recent memory. For the first time since 1994, Cleveland had double-digit wins with a 10–6 record. The Browns narrowly missed 2007–08 NFL playoffs and were the only 9+ win team not to qualify for the NFL&#x27;s postseason tournament.

====2008 season====
During the 2008 season, Winslow was hospitalized with a staph infection. Winslow then openly criticized former GM Phil Savage about not fixing the infection problem (the Browns had seven cases of staph infection in the last few years), and trying to hide the injury. Savage responded by suspending him for a week; owner Randy Lerner later apologized to Winslow and rescinded the suspension.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Winslow was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on February 27, 2009, for their 2nd-round pick in the 2009 NFL draft and their 5th-round pick in the 2010 NFL draft. He received the biggest contract for a tight end in NFL history with a 6-year, $36 million deal.

====2009 season====
Winslow went on to a record-breaking season with the Buccaneers in his first year with the team, including single-season franchise records for a tight end in receptions (77) and receiving yards (884). His 77 catches led the team that season.

====2010 season====
In his second year with the Buccaneers, he led the team in receptions with 66, for 730 yards and scored 5 touchdowns. The Bucs finished 10–6 in a rugged NFC South that included the Atlanta Falcons, who finished 13–3, and the New Orleans Saints, who finished 11–5. The division was the only one in the NFL to have three teams post double-digit wins in 2010. However, the Bucs narrowly missed the 2010–11 NFL playoffs. The Green Bay Packers, who had an identical 10–6 record, went on to win the Super Bowl that year.

====2011 season====
Once again Winslow led the team in receptions in his third season with the Buccaneers, recording 75 receptions for 763 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns.

Despite a strong outing in 2010 and a strong start in 2011, the Bucs finished 4–12.

On May 21, 2012, Winslow announced that the Buccaneers had informed him that he would either be traded or released. It was also reported that Winslow had been directed not to attend organized team activities (&#x27;OTAs&#x27;) while a trade was pursued, contradicting earlier reports that Winslow refused to participate in OTAs.

===Seattle Seahawks===
Winslow was traded to the Seattle Seahawks on May 22, 2012. On September 1, 2012, he was released by the Seahawks after declining to reduce his salary.

===New England Patriots===
Winslow signed with the New England Patriots on September 18, 2012. He then asked for his release and was granted it on September 27, 2012, after only playing in one game.

===New York Jets===
Winslow was invited to attend the New York Jets&#x27; mini-camp for a three-day tryout. Winslow subsequently signed a one-year contract on June 14, 2013, after general manager John Idzik and head coach Rex Ryan praised Winslow&#x27;s performance. On October 11, 2013, Winslow was suspended for four games for violating the NFL&#x27;s policy on performance-enhancing substances.

===Comeback attempt===
In 2016, Winslow attempted a comeback after sitting out for over two years. He had a workout with the Green Bay Packers in August but was not offered a contract.

Winslow participated in The Spring League in 2017 and 2018.

==NFL career statistics==
==Personal life==
He was married on June 15, 2006, to Janelle Winslow. The couple welcomed their first son Jalen in February 2011, and a daughter, Juliana, in August 2013. In August 2019, Janelle filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.

On October 17, 2006, Kellen&#x27;s half-brother Justin Winslow died, although no cause of death was reported; he was 23 years of age and was found unconscious by his mother. Kellen II and Justin are the only sons of Hall of Fame tight end Kellen Winslow.

==Legal history==
Winslow was charged with drug possession in January 2014
and received a conditional discharge without a guilty finding in the synthetic marijuana case.

On June 7, 2018, Winslow was arrested fleeing a mobile home park in Encinitas, California. He was charged with felony first degree burglary and held on $50,000 bond. Winslow was arrested on June 14, 2018, on charges of kidnapping and rape. In July, a judge ordered Winslow to stand trial for kidnapping and raping two women. Winslow was placed on house arrest with GPS monitoring after posting $2 million bail. In a separate case that month, he was also charged with raping an unconscious 17-year-old girl in 2003, when he was 19.

On March 4, 2019, Winslow&#x27;s bail was revoked, and he was jailed after being arraigned on two new counts of lewd conduct, and one count each of battery of an elder and willful cruelty to an elder, all misdemeanors, that he allegedly committed in Carlsbad, California, in February 2019. He was convicted of rape, a lewd act in public conduct and indecent exposure on June 10, 2019. He was also acquitted on another lewd act in public charge, and the judge sent the jury back to consider verdicts on all of the other charges. The following day, a mistrial was declared on the remaining eight charges. Prosecutors announced on June 14 that Winslow would be retried on the eight charges, with his second trial set to begin on September 30.

On November 4, 2019, Winslow pleaded guilty to the rape of an unconscious teen and sexual battery on a 54-year-old hitchhiker as part of a plea deal. In exchange for his guilty plea at San Diego County Superior Court, the court agreed to sentence him to between 12 and 18 years in prison, rather than life imprisonment if he was convicted in the retrial. As part of the agreement, he will automatically be on lifetime parole immediately upon release, and he waived his right to ever appeal any conviction or verdict in either trial. Winslow&#x27;s defense attorney said that his client suffered from frontal lobe damage and possible chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). While CTE could not be used as a defense in the trial, brain trauma was cited by his attorneys in requesting the minimum 12-year sentence. A clinical psychologist stated that Winslow had symptoms that were consistent with CTE. His sentencing was scheduled for March 18, 2020 but was postponed indefinitely due to concerns over the coronavirus.

On February 19, 2021, Winslow agreed and accepted a 14-year prison sentence for one count of rape and two counts of assault, and was sentenced on March 3, 2021. As of October 2023, Winslow is currently incarcerated at California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, California.

<doc id="963101" wikidata="Q5227700" url="?curid=963101" title="Tenchi in Tokyo">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series animated by AIC and aired on TV Tokyo from April 1 to September 23, 1997. It is the third installation of the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; line of series, preceding &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; and succeeding &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot;. The show was localized in North America by Geneon Entertainment and aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block from August 25 to September 29, 2000.

The opening theme was sung by Linda Yamamoto. The ending theme was , sung by the cast, and Episode 24 had its own ending theme, sung by Mayumi Iizuka.

==Plot==
&quot;Tenchi in Tokyo&quot; begins when Tenchi Masaki relocates to Tokyo to apprentice at a Shinto shrine. He meets a new love interest, Sakuya Kumashiro, who is a classmate of his at his new school. Much of the series revolves around the development of Tenchi&#x27;s and Sakuya&#x27;s relationship and its effect on the girls back in Okayama. Unlike the preceding series in the franchise (&quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki&quot; and &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot;), neither Tenchi nor his family have any connection to Jurai whatsoever in this series.

In this continuity, the girls meet Tenchi on Earth because of one incident that takes place two years prior to the series. At that time, Ryoko and Washu stole a crystal from Jurai and fled towards Earth, pursued by Ayeka, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, and the Guardians in Ayeka&#x27;s ship, and Mihoshi and Kiyone in a Galaxy Police ship. They are all injured when Ryoko consumes Ayeka&#x27;s crystal and becomes a monster. Tenchi defeats the monster when a necklace he is wearing (a memento of his mother) turns into a sword. During the anniversary party for this event at Tenchi&#x27;s home, it is revealed that each of the girls has a crystal from the necklace as a token of their bond with Tenchi, which they each took after Ryoko broke Tenchi&#x27;s necklace apart.

The main antagonist is Yugi, a mutant Juraian who was sealed away on Earth 3500 years ago when she almost destroyed Jurai by its ruler, Empress Hinase. She intends to take over the Earth by turning it into her own kingdom, much as she tried with Jurai. In order for her plans to succeed, she must break the bonds that hold the Masaki family together. Because, in this continuity, the Masakis are defenders of Earth. They perform this function with the power in the crystals, but the crystals need to be in proximity to one another for them to be able to function. Yugi executes her plan partly through her henchmen, such as Hotsuma, who convinces Ryoko to leave Earth with him, but also by forming a genuine friendship with Sasami through one of her projections, also named Yugi. When Yugi&#x27;s plan comes to fruition, it is revealed that Sakuya, too, is nothing more than another projection of Yugi, designed to scatter the Masaki Family. 
Yugi tries to get Tenchi to abandon reality and stay in a pocket universe with Sakuya, but Sakuya herself tells Tenchi to leave. When he does, the crystals summon the girls to him, and Tenchi is able to defeat Yugi. Yugi is then sealed away (at her own request) until she becomes a good person.

==Reception==
&quot;Tenchi in Tokyo&quot; was met with mixed reviews. &quot;Animefringe.com&quot; cited a &quot;horribly weak plot&quot; and that &quot;what makes the TV series almost unbearable to watch are the new character designs and the frequent use of super deformed animation[...] You’ll either love it or hate it.&quot; &quot;Animeworld.com&quot; gave the show a similarly moderate 2.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that although &quot;[it] is yet another very funny Tenchi series with all the great characters and bizarre situations[...]&quot;, &quot;They don&#x27;t bother explaining the entirely new backstories until a bit into it&quot; and that &quot;[it&#x27;s] either terribly lazy or shamelessly commercial that they couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to cook up some new character designs and reestablish the stereotypes for a new story.&quot;

Industry aggregator &quot;Mania.com&quot; awarded all of the North American DVD releases an A average, citing that although &quot;Tenchi in Tokyo is a bit more of a departure from the tried and true formula of the past&quot;, &quot;[the] show is definitely a welcomed addition in this household.&quot;

<doc id="963105" wikidata="Q3567573" url="?curid=963105" title="Wetrix">
<text>Wetrix is a 3D puzzle video game developed by Zed Two, the studio of brothers Ste and John Pickford, for the Nintendo 64 and personal computers in 1998, and the Dreamcast and Game Boy Color in 1999 (as Wetrix+ and Wetrix GB respectively). The player&#x27;s goal is to hold water bubbles falling on a 3D isometric landscape. To do this, enclosures are created with Uppers, which fall in a similar manner to &quot;Tetris&quot; blocks, that raise the ground. While water can be evaporated with fireballs, hazards such as Mines, Ice Cubes, and earthquakes also fall and ruin the player&#x27;s construction.

The Pickfords conceived a &quot;Tetris&quot;-esque puzzle game out of a water demo they worked on for another one of their Zed Two games, the hack and slash &quot;Vampire Circus&quot;. For design, the biggest focus was on the basic elements&#x27; interaction with each other, as well as the puzzle game style&#x27;s originality; the use of falling blocks was the only similarity between &quot;Wetrix&quot; and &quot;Tetris&quot;. Zed Two signed a two-game deal with Ocean Software, a week before its merge with Infogrames. It required the brothers to turn &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; into &quot;Taz Express&quot; (2000), while allowing the brothers free rein with &quot;Wetrix&quot;. The PC version was produced from January to October 1997 by the brothers themselves, while the Nintendo 64 port was developed with three additional programmers from around June to Christmas 1997.

The Nintendo 64 version sold over 105,000 units in the West, and just above 12,000 in Japan, while the PC version sold 30,000 copies. &quot;Wetrix&quot; was generally well-received by critics, who applauded its addictiveness and original concept but were critical of the limited camera mobility and divided on its difficulty, steep learning curve, and two-player mode. It garnered the highest rating for a review of a Western-developed title from the Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu Weekly&quot; in years. The critical and commercial success motivated Imagineer, developers of the Game Boy Color port, to commission Zed Two to develop a sequel, the PlayStation 2 launch title &quot;Aqua Aqua&quot;, which made little alterations to the main gameplay.

&quot;Wetrix&quot; is an isometric puzzle video game where the player, on a square landscape, produces mounds to hold water bubbles falling from the sky. Uppers, pieces that raise a part of the landscape that come in the shapes of rectangles, squares, and T-shapes, create walls for the lakes, while Downers do the opposite. If there is no wall in its way, water will seep off the edges and into a drain represented by a water meter; the game ends once it is full. Fireballs pop up which can evaporate water, which gives the player an amount of points depending on how much water was vaporized. By evaporating water with fireballs, the player is also able to reduce the level of the drain in order to avoid losing. There are also hazards that ruin the player&#x27;s structure, such as Mines which blast holes into the ground, Ice Cubes that freeze the water, and earthquakes that quickly turn the landscape flat once it is too high.

In addition to the regular Classic mode, &quot;Wetrix&quot; has Pro, which quickens the speed of the game, and Practice, which teaches basic rules. Challenge modes include those that end after a certain amount of time, such as one minute and five minutes, and others that must be survived within a number of pieces, including 100 and 500. There are also Handicap modes that start a game with a half-full water drain, an ice layer, Raised Land, Random Land, and Random Holes. The only multi-player feature is a two-player split screen battle mode, with the same goal as Classic but a different water meter with four colored spaces. One player can launch an attack at the other depending on which color space the water level is at; the meter also can not be lowered by evaporating a lake with a fireball.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===
In the mid-1990s, brothers Ste and John Pickford, developers at Software Creations, were dissatisfied with the stillborn projects and perceived declining creativity at the studio. They left to form their own independent company, Zed Two, in an attempt to &quot;re-learn game design from the very basics&quot;. The studio&#x27;s first project was &quot;Vampire Circus&quot;, a 3D isometric hack and slash video game in the style of &quot;Gauntlet&quot; (1985). John conceived programming methods that would have taken the most advantage of the available technology, such as having hundreds of foes on the screen at a time, and animating environmental elements in a &quot;dynamic&quot; manner. The environmental animations would be incorporated by having almost every part of the level be inflammable, and including flowing water that reacts to the explosions.

While Ste created the backgrounds and monsters, John experimented with water animation in a &quot;testbed&quot; separate from &quot;Vampire Circus&quot;″s code. Unlike other 3D games at the time that used a flat plane moving up and down as water, &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; was planned to have water moving as a &quot;dynamic fluid&quot;. The testbed consisted of a flat plane grid of vectors. Drops of water would fall onto them and combine to form pools of liquid that flowed and dropped off the plane. To further test the water meshing, John programmed the ability to shift the vectors of the plane. The water was a success.

The Pickfords&#x27; personal enjoyment of the water demo then gave them the idea to turn it into its own puzzle game. The game was initially named, as a joke, &quot;Wetris&quot;, but the title was later changed to something less similar to &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;Wetrix&quot;. Zed Two planned to release it as their first product before &quot;Vampire Circus&quot;. In their mind, the game would be cheaper and simpler to create, thus less of a risk to potential publishers, than &quot;Vampire Circus&quot;. Therefore, it could be used to make them established enough to produce the more ambitious hack and slash project.

However, as the Pickfords realized when searching for deals, &quot;publishers only wanted big, ambitious expensive games, and weren&#x27;t interested in cheap, small games, even if they were profitable&quot;, explained Ste. When pitching the puzzle game to Ocean Software, it did not initially grasp the publisher. However, within a week, the water demo was heavily played by testers, as well as a receptionist in-between calls. This won Zed Two a deal with Ocean to publish two games: &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; and &quot;Wetrix&quot;. Ocean required the small studio to turn &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; into a game starring the Tasmanian Devil, which became &quot;Taz Express&quot; (2000). However, the brothers were allowed free rein with &quot;Wetrix&quot;. This was the last deal Ocean made, as it began its merging into Infogrames a week later.

=== Design === 
Much brainstorming was done on what type of puzzle game to produce, such as being in the style of &quot;Lemmings&quot; (1991) or &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; series, but they ultimately settled on a &quot;Tetris&quot;-esque game. &quot;Wetrix&quot; was the Pickfords&#x27; first puzzle video game, a genre that was &quot;surprisingly difficult&quot; for them. Explained Ste, &quot;we tried to think about the thought processes and the emotions involved in playing a great puzzle game -- then tried to re-create and enhance those experiences with our own gameplay.&quot; A majority of the Pickfords&#x27; focus was on the basic elements of the gameplay, particularly their interaction between each other. Ste described the visuals for the &quot;simplest elements&quot; as the hardest to get right, even more than the special effects; he recalled creating &quot;eight or nine&quot; variations of the uppers and downers, and &quot;quite a few&quot; for the water bubbles. Although a &quot;Tetris&quot;-style game was the initial concept, the only overlap between the two puzzle games was blocks falling to the ground. From the Pickfords&#x27; perspective, most other &quot;Tetris&quot;-inspired titles made too little changes to the rules, so they intended for &quot;Wetrix&quot; to be more original. One method was a creativity aspect, where there were infinite ways to build the landscape and, thus, players could experiment with different methods of scoring points.

=== Production ===
Zed Two began the &quot;Wetrix&quot; project as a PC title, with no plans for porting to consoles. This was because, at the time, no small independent studio had the budget to develop for major consoles. After Zed Two&#x27;s inquisition, a friend of the Pickfords, who worked at Software Creations, used the PC source to secretly code a Nintendo 64 port with the Manchester company&#x27;s development kit. The programmer showed the brothers and Ocean the cartridge a week after the deal, and Ocean approved. Then, at an E3 conference, the brothers showed it to Nintendo for approval. As Ste recalled the Japanese company&#x27;s reaction, &quot;We booted up the game in the meeting room, they took one look and just said, &#x27;Yep, we need all the games we can get!&#x27; And that was it, we were in business!&quot;

The PC version was mostly only done by the Pickfords from January to October 1997, while a different team consisting of Amir Latif, David Gill, and Jan van Valburg programmed the Nintendo 64 release from around June to Christmas 1997. The brothers had no other source of income, meaning finishing either &quot;Wetrix&quot; or &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; needed to be done quickly to pay their rent. This budget limitation meant having to resort to a pre-made 3D model built into a package of 3D Studio 4 for the rubber duck. The polygon meshing and animations for the water flowing and 3D landscape shifting up and down were the easiest parts of development. John described the water animation as &quot;a simple cellular system where each cell compares itself with its neighbours and exchanges water if there&#x27;s a difference&quot;.

== Release and ports ==
&quot;IGN&quot; was the first publication to announce &quot;Wetrix&quot; on 14 August 1997, although only the Nintendo 64 version. It revealed Zed Two to be the developer, Ocean the publisher, and with no screenshot, only had the following description: &quot;players must create (or open) channels of water and evaporate it using balloons that also fall onto the screen. The more water you dispose of the more points you acquire.&quot; On 12 March 1998, the cover art was revealed, and the date for the Nintendo 64 version was set at April 1998. It was delayed to June 1998, &quot;IGN&quot; suspecting it was due to issues of manufacturing copies.

In North America, the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Wetrix&quot; was released on 12 June 1998. Ocean released the Nintendo 64 and PC versions on 19 June 1998 in Europe. Imagineer published the game on 27 November 1998 in Japan. It sold over 105,000 units in the West, and just above 12,000 in Japan. Despite selling well, &quot;Wetrix&quot; had its budget cut by Infogrames, which was moved to other projects, feeling the puzzle title would not fit their reputation of producing &quot;mega hit&quot; games. This prevented Ocean US from selling more copies of the Nintendo 64 version than they did, and caused a seven-player LAN mode the brothers worked on to remain unfinished. The PC version was announced by Infogrames on 19 November 1998, and released on 15 January 1999, selling 30,000 copies worldwide.

Ocean hired Imagineer to develop a Game Boy Color port. Although the IP rights were held between Ocean and Zed Two, the port&#x27;s development began without the knowledge of the Pickfords. The brothers were angry once they found out. Ocean and Zed Two settled by having the latter hold intellectual property rights for future iterations. John also created his own prototype of a &quot;Wetrix&quot; water level on the Game Boy Color, but Imagineer went with theirs instead. The port was released in Japan on 29 October 1999 and in Europe on 29 September 2000. The Dreamcast port, &quot;Wetrix+&quot; was released by Xicat Interactive in the United States on 16 December 1999 with distribution handled by Acclaim Entertainment, and by Take-Two Interactive in Europe on 31 March 2000. A Japanese version of &quot;Wetrix&quot; for the Dreamcast, named &quot;Aquapanic&quot;, was commissioned but dropped near its completion, at the end of the console&#x27;s lifespan.

== Reception ==

=== General ===
&quot;Wetrix&quot; received generally positive reviews, including one in &quot;Famitsu&quot;, which had the highest rating for a Western-developed product in years. A common highlight was its unique puzzle game concept, which &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; described as a mixture of &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Populous&quot; (1989). Due to the fact that it involves falling pieces, &quot;Wetrix&quot; was heavily compared to not only &quot;Tetris&quot; entries, but the Nintendo 64 titles &quot;Tetrisphere&quot; and &quot;Bust-A-Move 2&quot; (1998). &quot;Edge&quot; considered &quot;Welltris&quot; (1990) the &quot;Tetris&quot; game most similar to &quot;Wetrix&quot; due to its use of falling pieces within a 3D perspective. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; critic Victor Lucas and &quot;Hyper&quot; journalists Eliot Fish and Tom Holloway found its spin on &quot;Tetris&quot; elements refreshing, given the amount of other titles that copied &quot;Tetris&quot; mechanics without doing anything innovative. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Trent C. Ward noted that with previous puzzle video games, &quot;the further developers got from Tetris, the more annoyed people got&quot;, making &quot;Wetrix&quot;″s success as both an original and enjoyable puzzle game profound.

=== Difficulty ===
The high difficulty and steep learning curve generally garnered a mixed response; critics suggested that while it would appeal to hardcore puzzle game veterans, it may not be suited for all players, especially first-timers. Reviewers from &quot;Edge&quot; and &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; claimed an individual&#x27;s first playthrough can end in seconds. Lucas, a frequent player of puzzle gamers and self-admitted pro at &quot;Rampart&quot; (1990), which also involved building enclosures, was still in the first tutorial stage an hour into &quot;Wetrix&quot;. The challenge was attributed to the controls, fast object dropping, and the randomization of what falls. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; found the Game Boy Color port inferior to the original Nintendo 64 release for its slower falling speed. 

Also brought up was the game&#x27;s addictiveness. It was attributed to the difficulty, high-score list, multipliers, different methods of earning points, visual rewards, and additional modes. Excitedly wrote &quot;N64 Magazine&quot;″s James Price, &quot;As it brooks little familiarity with lesser skilled players, you actually feel as if you&#x27;re achieving something by reaching level 15 with an unbelievably high number of points.&quot;

Supporters of the challenge argued that it teaches players to long-term plan and not panic over small water drains. Detractors complained it was artificial and made the game more obnoxious than enjoyable. &quot;Consoles +&quot; found the board too small to create enough lakes to handle the overwhelming amount of water. Anne Royal of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; wrote that the slightest mistake could instantly end a play-through. She and Schneider felt the game should have adequately accustomed beginners to the gameplay, and John Davison argued the amount of randomization between uppers and water was too much. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the earthquake mechanic for effectively ending games, and opined it prevented &quot;Wetrix&quot; from being a truly amazing puzzle title. The PC version was also criticized for its controls. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Ron Dulin had trouble placing pieces with the mouse, and Ward struggled with the controls overall, especially the keyboard setups.
=== Other gameplay criticisms ===
Reviewers found it excessively tricky to position the falling pieces, an issue mostly attributed to the limited camera mobility. There are only three choices for viewing the map. Critics though two were distant to the point of harming visibility, and another was too close to see the entire map. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; felt the issue was worsened by lack of sensitivity in the controls. The problem was also blamed on misleading shadows and other visuals that distracted the player from them. Water trickles were also hard to spot from the few choices of angles, not helped by the draining water&#x27;s lack of graphical detail, argued Fish and &quot;Game Informer&quot; critics Jon and Reiner. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; criticized the Game Boy Color version&#x27;s color palette for making it hard to notice the location of lakes. 

Reviewers also brought up the general product&#x27;s limited depth and replay-ability. For them, the experience was repetitive due to a lack of variation in gameplay and level aesthetics, wearing thin after a few hours. Huhtala noted the maximum difficulty to be at the tenth level. &quot;PC Zone&quot; journalist Paul Presley found &quot;Wetrix&quot; &quot;colourful and flashy on the surface&quot;, but &quot;staggeringly ordinary&quot; underneath. His main criticism was that the typical appealing elements of puzzle games, such as simplicity, quirkiness, and addictiveness, felt forced instead of naturally executed.

The two-player mode divided critics. Its supporters highlighted its competitive nature, a result of each player having to focus on keeping their own board intact while attacking the opponent. Others were underwhelmed. Schneider and Ricciardi found it weaker than two-player modes in other puzzle titles, such as &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; (1994) and those of the &quot;Tetris&quot; series. A common complaint was the decreased size of each player&#x27;s map as a result of the split-screen, causing the pieces to be even harder to view. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; reviewer Shaun White disliked the mode&#x27;s slow pace and expressed annoyance towards attacks temporarily obscuring the playing fields. Fielder and Gantayat also criticized the lack of four-player modes, such as tournaments and two-on-twos.

=== Graphics and sound ===
Opinions on the graphics ranged from Jon finding them &quot;lame&quot; and Fielder stating they need more finesse, to positive claims of taking advantage of console space even considering its simple style. &quot;Total 64&quot;″s Simon argued it was mature in comparison to most other Nintendo 64 titles. Most of the praise was directed at the water, particularly its realistic flowing, ripple effects, transparency and reflection mapping. Other praised aspects include the special effects, the vibrant color palette and psychedelic backgrounds. Less positively, a writer for &quot;Revista Oficial Dreamcast&quot; called them &quot;colorful and little else&quot;, bashing them as so outdated they would be suitable in the 8-bit console era. 

&quot;Wetrix&quot;″s new age ambient techno soundtrack was well-received for suiting the gameplay, Schneider analogizing it as if Jean-Michel Jarre composed &quot;Top Gear Rally&quot; (1997). The sound effects were positively-commented on, a common note being their accuracy to real-life environmental elements, such as the splashes, ripples, and evaporation of water and the explosion of bombs. An &quot;Ultimate PC&quot; critic admitted the sound effects intensified the gameplay, stating the alarm &quot;will almost certainly send a shiver down your spine&quot;. Also highlighted was the electronically-altered announcer voice, which Bad Hare of &quot;GamePro&quot; compared to that of &quot;Wipeout XL&quot; (1996). Schneider expressed being spooked out by it, and Lucas claimed the warble effect matched with the cute character designed.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Wetrix&quot;″s critical and commercial success inspired Imagineer to commission Zed Two to develop a sequel, &quot;Aqua Aqua&quot; (2000), which was a launch title for the PlayStation 2. The gameplay remained largely unaltered, new features including a Story Mode with bosses and cute-looking characters that Imagineer commanded Zed Two to add to make the product more appealing to Japanese audiences. Despite a positive critical reception and decent sales, there have been no further &quot;Wetrix&quot; titles.

<doc id="963106" wikidata="Q2479469" url="?curid=963106" title="Bussana Vecchia">
<text>Bussana Vecchia is a former ghost town in Liguria, Italy. Abandoned due to an earthquake in 1887, it was renovated and repopulated by an international community of artists in the early 1960s. It is administratively a hamlet (&quot;frazione&quot;) of the city of Sanremo, near the border with France. To this day, it is home to a small group of local inhabitants as well as international artists, with craft shops, cafes, and restaurants, and has over the years gained the reputation of a rural artists&#x27; residence within the setting of a medieval village.

==Physical geography== 
The town is located about 8 km northeast of Sanremo on a rocky hill behind Bussana Nuova. The land it occupies is relatively green, surrounded by Mediterranean scrub, chestnut groves, and maritime pines; however, the entire area has recently been used as an industrial zone, mainly for floriculture.

==History==
===Early history===
Bussana was founded in Roman times, and originally named Armedina or Armedana; it was only in the 7th century, however, that the first evidence of stable settlements appeared. Following Lombard invasions, the local population decided to move to the underlying Valle Armea, where it remained until the 10th century, when frequent Saracen invasions forced them to move again to a higher and more easily defensible area. The construction of the first defensive structures on the hill began around this time.

Beginning in the 11th century, Bussana fell under the control of the Counts of Ventimiglia, who provided for the construction of a first defensive castle.

In the 13th century, the town was bought by the Republic of Genoa, though the approximately 250 inhabitants maintained a relative amount of autonomy. During this time, the original castle lost its defensive function and was converted to a residential structure. The annexed chapel continues to serve as a place of worship for the inhabitants of the village.

Starting from the 15th century, a building boom began in the town, accompanied by a strong demographic increase; in 1404, the first church was completed, built on the remains of a previous one, and dedicated to Saint Giles. At the same time the houses, built according to the Roman style with square stones, began to be made using rounded stones from the nearby rocky beaches. The original abandoned castle is now in ruins. In the 16th century, the town expanded to the southeast, and it is to this period that almost all the buildings currently present in the village can be dated. The 17th century saw the complete renovation of the local church, which passed from the original Romanesque style to the Baroque.

Life in the village continued relatively quietly, so much so that over the next two centuries, the settlement remained essentially unchanged. The population was predominantly rural, subsisting on agriculture, cultivation of olives and citrus fruits, and small-scale animal husbandry.

Beginning in the 19th century, the first signs of the dangerousness of the place began to be felt, with an increasing understanding of the seismic risk of the area. The first notable earthquakes were recorded in 1831, 1851, and 1854, and this led the population to reinforce the existing structures with arches and columns.

===Earthquake===
The French Riviera and western Liguria are at the junction of the southwestern Alps and the Liguria basin, a region of moderate seismicity. The severest earthquake to hit Bussana struck the region on 23 February 1887, killing more than 2,000 people. The worst of the damage in Bussana occurred at 6:21 on that Ash Wednesday morning, as a seismic wave lasting 20 seconds caused immediate destruction and deaths throughout the village.

The earthquake was the first recorded by a true seismograph built by Filippo Cecchi in Moncalieri, Italy.

Most buildings in Bussana were severely damaged and the authorities decided to rebuild the village on a new site downhill called Bussana Nuova (&quot;New Bussana&quot;), which had until then been known as Capo Marine. The old village was abandoned and all of its buildings declared too dangerous for habitation.

In 1889, the cornerstone of the town of Bussana Nuova was laid, and in 1894 the Bussanesi abandoned the original village, celebrating their last Mass on Palm Sunday. The original town, from that moment, would be known as &quot;Bussana Vecchia&quot; (&quot;Old Bussana&quot;).

===Rebirth===
In 1947, immigrants from southern Italy started illegally settling the ghost town. After a few forced evictions by the Italian police in the 1950s, the authorities ordered the destruction of all first-floor stairways and rooftops.

Despite this, in the early 1960s, Vanni Giuffrè, a Sicilian painter, together with a group of artists, the Community of International Artists (now International Artists&#x27; Village), decided to move to what was by then commonly known as Bussana Vecchia. The spirit of the organization was somewhat idealistic: to be able to live simply and to work artistically within the village.

The settlement had no electricity, tap water, or sanitation, but the new community of inhabitants grew from the small original nucleus to around 20–30 people by 1968, mostly hippie artists coming from all over Europe (Italy, Austria, England, France, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden).

Tensions with the old inhabitants and with the police grew until, on 25 July 1968, an eviction was ordered again and the police were sent to the village to enforce it. When the police forces arrived, they were faced with the villagers behind barricades refusing to leave and by a large group of international news reporters. The police decided to avoid confrontation.

The first internal problems surrounding the legal recognition of properties in the village arose in the early 70s. Private property began to emerge as a necessity, in stark contrast to the initial ideals of the community of artists. In the meantime, the descendants of the original inhabitants of the town founded the &quot;Amici di Bussana&quot; (&quot;Friends of Bussana&quot;) association, with the intention of regaining possession of the areas belonging to their ancestors, and they proceeded to enclose and declare the whole northern area of the town as their own.

===Today===
During the past sixty years, Bussana Vecchia has been partially rebuilt by its new inhabitants. The International Artists&#x27; Village was born, and despite periodic confrontations with the authorities (the latest eviction order was issued in 1997 when all buildings were declared property of the Italian Government), the community is still living there, selling its handiwork to tourists, and organizing artistic events.
The artists and craftsmen, who live and work in Bussana Vecchia, have turned it into what it is today: an oasis of creativity, a unique and special place in the world.

In 1974, the municipal aqueduct was connected to the town.
In 1976, a meeting was held with all the villagers to discuss the future of the settlement, and it was decided to launch the &quot;Committee of the Village of Bussana Vecchia&quot;. This committee was then officially recognized by the municipality of Sanremo, which thus also recognized the new toponymy of &quot;Bussana Vecchia&quot;. In the same year, the first residences were legally recognized and in 1977, electricity was connected to the entire town.

By the early 1980s, the resident population had risen to around a hundred people. However, the inhabitants were no longer exclusively artists: the economic-speculative boom of the time led many people to think that they could make easy profits with summer tourism, opening up more cheap craft shops, and thus lowering the quality level of the artistic productions.

The development of the village now also involved the Municipality of Sanremo, which in 1982 announced an international competition to decide on the restructuring to be implemented at the site. In the meantime, the &quot;New International Artists&#x27; Community&quot; was officially recognized as a group which spoke for all the inhabitants of the village.

In December 2017, the Italian Department of State Property (Demanio) sent tax settlements of tens of thousands of Euros to all the inhabitants and termed them &quot;occupiers&quot;. Fear arose within the village that the &quot;Bussanesi&quot; might lose their homes, which they had rebuilt from ruins. That same month, the Bussanesi launched a petition to &quot;Save Bussana Vecchia&quot;.
The Italian Department of State Property is planning to transfer full responsibility for Bussana Vecchia to the City of Sanremo starting in 2018.

In March 2019, the M5S (Five Star Movement) political party threatened to begin evicting all residents of Bussana Vecchia unless the Municipality of Sanremo comes up with a plan for long-overdue repairs and maintenance by the end of April 2019, citing issues of safety for residents of the village, and in the interests of safeguarding the former ghost town for its unique tourist attractions.
As of September 2019, the motion had been suspended and is up for review in January 2020.

==Attractions==
The village of Bussana Vecchia can be toured entirely on foot in about an hour. One of the major attractions for tourists are the characteristic shops and ateliers, which can be seen and visited almost everywhere in the village.
The old church of Saint Giles, never restored, still shows traces of the original stuccos and paintings; it can only be visited from the outside, as it is structurally unsafe. The church belfry miraculously escaped the earthquake, and is seen by the inhabitants of Bussana Vecchia as the symbol of the town.
The Oratory of John the Baptist, located in the eastern part of the town, can also be visited only from the outside.

The town has been used for years by artists from all over the world, and this has influenced the type of events that take place there seasonally. Theatrical events, art exhibitions, and live music, especially on summer evenings, are among the most popular activities.

==Economy==
The original settlement of Bussana based its economy on the cultivation of olives and citrus fruits, and on fairly limited cereal cultivation. With the growth of interest in floriculture at the end of the 19th century, this possibility was beginning to be explored, and was then carried on by the inhabitants of Bussana Nuova.

Currently, the economy is based entirely on tourism. The village offers bars, eateries, and restaurants offering vegetarian and Ligurian cuisine; additionally there is a bed &amp; breakfast, a botanical garden, a nursery, and numerous workshops for artists and artisans who sell their products.

==Transport== 
By road
Bussana Vecchia can be reached by exiting the A10 &quot;dei Fiori&quot; motorway at the Sanremo Est/Arma di Taggia tollbooth, taking the Aurelia Bis to the Valle Armea exit, and following the road signs for Bussana/Bussana Vecchia.
The village is accessible only by foot, so it is necessary to park outside the town, on the street.

By train 
The nearest railway station is Taggia - Arma; a little further away is the Sanremo station.

By bus 
Buses run from the Sanremo bus station to Bussana Nuova on a regular basis; during the summer, there are sometimes shuttle buses going to Bussana Vecchia from Bussana Nuova or directly from Sanremo.

<text>The Orange Line is an East-West line of the Kaohsiung Metro in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. It opened on 14 September 2008, the day of Mid-Autumn Festival, for a week-long free trial service. After the free trial service, the Kaohsiung Metro offered a month-long single one-way promotional NT$15 service on both the Red and the Orange line, with regular ticket price applies after this.

The line has 14 stations and is the second metro line to open in southern Taiwan. Shortly prior to opening, flaws such as emergency exit lighted signs, unclear ticket displays, and jammed emergency exits were fixed. Although it was originally supposed to open with the Red Line, it was delayed due to a tunnel collapse during construction December 2005.

<doc id="963121" wikidata="Q731203" url="?curid=963121" title="1972 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1972 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XI Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Sapporo, Japan, from 3 to 13 February 1972. A total of 1,006 athletes representing 35 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 35 events from 10 different sports and disciplines.

Seventeen NOCs won at least one medal and fourteen of them collected at least one gold. The Soviet Union finished at the top of the gold and overall medal counts with 8 and 16, respectively. Along with Norway, the Soviet team also won the most silver medals (5). East Germany, which ended the Games behind the Soviet Union with 14 medals, secured the most bronzes (7). The host nation, Japan, won a record total of three medals (one of each color), which included its first Winter Olympics gold medal.

Three NOCs won a single medal: Canada (silver), Poland and Spain (gold). For the last two, these were their first-ever gold medals at the Winter Olympics, and in the case of Spain, it was its first medal. This was Canada&#x27;s weakest result since the 1936 Winter Olympics, when its athletes also brought home a single silver medal.
The NOCs from the Republic of China and the Philippines sent athletes to the Winter Olympics for the first time, but failed to win any medals.

==Highlights==
Hosting the Olympic Winter Games for the first time, Japan&#x27;s record consisted of a single medal: a silver in alpine skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics. In Sapporo, Yukio Kasaya, Akitsugu Konno, and Seiji Aochi won the ski jumping normal hill (70 m) gold, silver, and bronze medal, respectively. Kasaya&#x27;s gold was Japan&#x27;s first-ever at the Winter Games. This result would persist as the country&#x27;s best for the next 20 years.

Wojciech Fortuna of Poland won the ski jumping&#x27;s large hill (90 m) event, while Spain&#x27;s Francisco Fernández Ochoa prevailed in the alpine skiing&#x27;s men&#x27;s slalom, thus becoming their respective countries&#x27; first Winter Olympic champions. Ochoa&#x27;s gold medal was also Spain&#x27;s first medal at the Winter Games. Karen Magnussen&#x27;s silver in the figure skating singles competition was Canada&#x27;s sole medal and reflected what was the NOC&#x27;s weakest performance since the 1936 Winter Games.
For the first time in its history, a delegation from Finland concluded its participation at the Winter Olympics without gold medals.

Six Soviet Union medals were won by two cross-country skiers: Galina Kulakova, who took gold in both women&#x27;s individual distances and in the relay event; and Vyacheslav Vedenin, who won the 30 km—becoming the first Soviet skier to win an individual Olympic title—and the relay events, and came third in the 50 km. 
East German lugers won eight medals for their NOC by taking every medal in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles, and placing two teams in the top three of the doubles event. 
Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner of Italy were the only non-East German athletes to win a luge medal, as they shared the doubles gold with Horst Hörnlein and Reinhard Bredow. 
Italy&#x27;s other gold medal was won by Gustav Thöni in the men&#x27;s giant slalom; he also took silver in the men&#x27;s slalom, thus contributing two of his country&#x27;s five medals. 
Marie-Theres Nadig skied her way to victory in the women&#x27;s downhill and giant slalom events, winning half of Switzerland&#x27;s gold medals and helping her country achieve its best result at that time.
Two-time world figure skating champion Ondrej Nepela added the Olympic men&#x27;s singles title to his career and guaranteed Czechoslovakia&#x27;s second and last gold medal in its Winter Olympics history.

Half of the United States&#x27; eight medals were obtained in women&#x27;s speed skating: Anne Henning won a gold in the 500 m and a bronze in the 1000 m, while Dianne Holum grabbed a gold in the 1500 m and a silver in the 3000 m. 
Also in this discipline, Ard Schenk (three golds), Stien Baas-Kaiser (one gold and one silver), Atje Keulen-Deelstra (one silver and two bronzes), and Kees Verkerk (one silver) were responsible for all nine medals for the Netherlands. 
This was the best performance by a Dutch delegation at the Winter Olympics, and it took 26 years to be improved, when the Games returned to Japan.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

In the doubles event in luge, two gold medals were awarded for a first place tie and, consequently, no silver medal was awarded. This explains the 36 gold and 34 silver medals distributed during the Games.

==Notes==
# Switzerland also collected a total of 10 medals at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, but it won only three golds versus the four obtained in Sapporo.
# The Netherlands summed nine medals in Sapporo, just like at the 1968 Winter Olympics, but won four golds, one more than in Grenoble.

<text>The Pixie-bob is a breed of domestic cat claimed to be the progeny of naturally occurring bobcat hybrids. However, DNA testing has failed to detect bobcat marker genes, and Pixie-bobs are considered wholly domestic for the purposes of ownership, cat fancy registration, and import and export. They were, however, selected and bred to look like American bobcats.

==History==
In the spring of 1985, Carol Ann Brewer purchased near Mount Baker, Washington, a unique male cat with a spotted coat, a short tail, and polydactyl paws. In January 1986, she rescued another male cat named Keba, which was very large, had a bobbed tail, and was reported to have been sired by a bobcat. While this cat was starving, it still weighed 17 pounds, and was so tall it reached up to Brewer&#x27;s knees. Shortly after she had acquired this large male, it mated with a next door neighbor&#x27;s brown spotted female cat. In April 1986, a litter was born from this mating. Brewer eventually kept one of the female kittens, named &quot;Pixie&quot;, and after a year started a breeding program with Pixie as the foundation cat.

Over the next couple of years, Brewer introduced into her program 23 cats from around the nearby Cascade Range, that were believed by her to be born from naturally occurring matings between bobcats and domestic cats. She coined the term &quot;Legend Cat&quot; to refer to such cats and has since registered a trademark in the U.S. to limit the term to describe permitted outcrosses used in her breeding program. At the same time, other breeders in the U.S. were working with distinctly wild looking barn cats and collaborated with Brewer to establish a broad genetic base and to develop the foundation of today&#x27;s Pixie-bob.

Led by Brewer, they succeeded in registering their new breed with The International Cat Association (TICA) and eventually the American Cat Fancier&#x27;s Association (ACFA). The Pixie-bob was accepted into the &quot;Exhibition&quot; category by TICA in 1993, promoted to &quot;New Breed and Color&quot; status in 1996 and eventually gained Championship status in 1998. The Pixie-bob was classified by TICA initially as a &quot;Native New Breed&quot;, defined as &quot;A new breed which has been identified through selection of phenotypically similar individuals from a naturally occurring population indigenous to a particular geographic region&quot; but it is now classified as an established breed.

Frank Ditto attempted to patent the Pixie-bob in 1999, but his application was rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Successive litigation upheld the rejection.

== Breed standard ==
Pixie-bobs are a fully-domesticated, selectively-bred breed of cat (&quot;Felis cattus&quot;) intended to resemble the North American bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;).

While the average domestic cat breed weighs about 8 lb (4 kg), Pixie-bobs can be somewhat larger, but (on average) usually do not exceed 11 lb (5 kg), similar to a medium- to large-sized domestic cat. Only very few breeders are regularly producing larger cats, which are generally large-boned, muscular and massive in form. Male Pixie-bobs are, most times, larger than females. Pixie-bobs grow for up to four years, instead of one year, like most domestic breeds.

Most Pixie-bobs have black fur and skin on the bottom of their paws, with tipped ears, heavy ear-hair, black lips, and white fur around the eyes (but with black eye-skin). Their muzzle is large, with rounded whisker pads and a red nose-leather. Their chins have white fur, but often have black skin underwear. Some of their whiskers change from black (root – about 25%) to white (to the tip – about 75% of the whisker). Their bobcat-like fur pattern often has reddish, apricot, and peach tones mixed-in. Most are short-haired, but some are long-haired. The brow should be heavy and the eyes should have a triangular shape. Eyes are blue when kittens, then change to green or gold when several months old. Tail size can range from 2 inches (approximately 5 cm) to hock length when leg is extended. The head is pear-shaped and is considered to be the most important characteristic.

It is not presently known what genetic similarity there may be (or not) between the Pixie-bob and other breeds with suppressed tails, such as the Manx, American Bobtail, and Japanese Bobtail.
==Temperament==
Pixie-bobs are said to be highly intelligent, social, active, bold, and enjoy playing with other animals. They are also known for their &quot;chirps&quot;, chatters, and growls; most meow scarcely if at all.

Most Pixie-bobs are highly sociable around both their owners and strangers. Almost all Pixie-bobs like to be in the same room as their owners, and will follow them around the house.

Other personality characteristics include the following:

* Head butting
* Ball fetching and playing
* Leash walking (for the most part)
* Highly intelligent
* Capable of understanding some words

==Health==
As the breed is frequently outcrossed to &quot;legend cats&quot;, Pixie-bobs are genetically diverse and are not prone to problems caused by inbreeding. Pixie-bob breeders use a disease database, Pawpeds, to ensure that health information can be recorded and monitored.

Some genetic conditions include the following:

* Cryptorchidism – only a few cases have been recorded in Pixie-bobs since the conception of this breed in the 1980s.
* Dystocia and cystic endometrial hyperplasia – A very small percentage of Pixie-bobs do suffer from delivery problems, and are removed from breeding.
* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) – Since the advent of the Pixie-bob breed in the 1980s, only a few cases have been reported. In some of those cases the Pixie-bob was cross-bred with other breeds of cats, such as Bengal and Maine Coon. In the majority of cases, HCM occurred spontaneously. HCM is hereditary in at least 50% of occurrences requiring annual ultrasound screens to continuously monitor the good health of the cats.

<doc id="963140" wikidata="Q1888593" url="?curid=963140" title="Magic (game terminology)">
<text>Magic or mana is an attribute assigned to characters within a role-playing or video game that indicates their power to use special magical abilities or &quot;spells&quot;. Magic is usually measured in magic points or mana points, shortened as MP. Different abilities will use up different amounts of MP. When the MP of a character reaches zero, the character will not be able to use special abilities until some of their MP is recovered.

Much like health, magic might be displayed as a numeric value, such as &quot;50/100&quot;. Here, the first number indicates the current amount of MP a character has whereas the second number indicates the character&#x27;s maximum MP. In video games, magic can also be displayed visually, such as with a gauge that empties itself as a character uses their abilities.

==History==
The magic system in tabletop role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is largely based on patterns established in the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; novels of author Jack Vance. In this system, the player character can only memorize a fixed number of spells from a list of spells. Once this spell is used once, the character forgets it and becomes unable to use it again.

&quot;Mana&quot; is a word that comes from Polynesian languages with a complex meaning. Mostly, it loosely represents power, respect and dignity. The concept of mana was introduced in Europe by missionary Robert Henry Codrington in 1891 and was popularized by Mircea Eliade in the 1950s. It was first introduced as a magical fuel used to cast spells in the 1969 short story, &quot;Not Long Before the End&quot;, by Larry Niven, which is part of and later popularized by his &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot; setting. It has since become a common staple in both role-playing and video games.

==Mechanisms==

Because skills and abilities are not usually lost, a game designer might decide to limit the use of such an ability by linking its use to magic points. This way, after using an ability, the player is required to rest or use an item to replenish their character&#x27;s MP. This is done for balancing, so that each skill does not have an infinite casting ability with equal results every time.

&quot;Magic&quot; may be substituted with psychic powers, spiritual power, advanced technology or other concepts that would allow a character to influence the world around them that is not available in real life. Magic is often restricted to a specific class of character, such as a &quot;mage&quot; or &quot;spellcaster&quot;, while other character classes have to rely on melee combat or physical projectiles. Other character classes, such as those that rely on melee attacks, may also have a &quot;magic&quot; bar that limits their special abilities, although they are usually called something different, such as the Barbarian&#x27;s &quot;Fury&quot; in &quot;Diablo 3&quot;.

In video games, MP can often be restored by consuming magic potions or it may regenerate over time. Status effects are temporary modification to a game character&#x27;s original set of stats. A character may cast a spell that inflicts a positive or negative status effect on another character.

===In role-playing games===

In both tabletop role-playing games and role-playing video games, magic is most usually used to cast spells during battles. However magic has many uses outside of combat situations, such as using love spells on NPCs to gain information. Some games base the strength and amount of a character&#x27;s magic on stats such as &quot;wisdom&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot;. These stats are used because they are easy to keep track of and develop in pen-and-paper RPGs.

Some games introduce a separate point system per skill. For example, in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, each skill of each fighting character has its own &quot;Power Points&quot; (PP). If the PP of only one of its skills are depleted, that specific Pokémon still has three other skills to choose from.

===In god games===
In god games, the player&#x27;s power is usually called mana and grows along with the number and prosperity of the player&#x27;s worshipers. Here, the population size influences the maximum amount of mana the player has and the rate at which their mana restores itself when it is below that maximum. Using &quot;godly powers&quot; consumes mana, but such actions are necessary to increase the number and prosperity of the population.

<text>Woolloomooloo ( ) is a harbourside, inner-city eastern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1.5 kilometres east of the central business district, in the local government area of the City of Sydney. It is in a low-lying, former docklands area at the head of Woolloomooloo Bay, on Sydney Harbour. The Domain sits to the west, the locality of East Sydney is near the south-west corner of the suburb and the locality of Kings Cross is near the south-east corner. Potts Point is immediately to the east.

Woolloomooloo was originally a working-class district of Sydney and has only recently changed with gentrification of the inner city areas of Sydney. The redevelopment of the waterfront, particularly the construction of the housing development on the Finger Wharf, has caused major change. Areas of public housing still exist in the suburb, with 22% homes in the 2011 postcode, owned by Housing NSW, in front of Redfern, Eastlakes and Glebe. 

Woolloomooloo is home to Artspace, an independent, not-for-profit, contemporary art space which is located in the heritage-listed Gunnery building.

==History==
===Aboriginal culture===

The current spelling of &quot;Woolloomooloo&quot; is derived from the name of the first homestead in the area, &quot;Wolloomooloo House&quot;, built by the first landowner John Palmer. There is debate as to how Palmer came up with the name with different Aboriginal words being suggested. Anthropologist J.D. McCarthy wrote in &#x27;NSW Aboriginal Places Names&#x27;, in 1946, that Woolloomooloo could be derived from either &quot;Wallamullah&quot;, meaning &quot;place of plenty&quot; or &quot;Wallabahmullah&quot;, meaning a &quot;young black kangaroo&quot;.

In 1852, the traveller Col. G.C. Mundy wrote that the name came from &quot;Wala-mala&quot;, meaning an &quot;[Aboriginal] burial ground&quot;. It has also been suggested that the name means &quot;field of blood&quot;, due to the alleged Aboriginal tribal fights that took place in the area, or that it is from the pronunciation by Aboriginals of &quot;windmill&quot;, from the one that existed on Darlinghurst ridge until the 1850s.

===European settlement===

After the First Fleet&#x27;s arrival in Sydney, the area was initially recognised as Garden Cove or Garden Island Cove after the nearby small wooded Garden Island, off the shore. The first land grant was given to John Palmer in 1793 to allow him to run cattle for the fledgling colony.

An 1832 map by Thomas Mitchell shows &quot;Woolloomooloo Estate&quot; extending from the road &quot;To South Head&quot; northwards to Woolloomooloo Bay. To the east lies a hill with windmills and a &quot;New Prison&quot;, and land grants on the peninsula that is now the suburbs of Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay.

In the 1840s, the farm land was subdivided into what is now Woolloomooloo, Darlinghurst and parts of Surry Hills. Originally the area saw affluent residents building grand houses, many with spectacular gardens, attracted by the bay and close proximity to the city and Government House.

The area slowly started to change after expensive houses were built in Elizabeth Bay and further east and a road was needed from Sydney. It was for this reason that William Street was built, dividing the land for the first time.

Woolloomooloo Bay was used extensively as a port. As recently as October 1971, the Maritime Services Board opened a 200 metre berth on the western side of the bay.

===Trams===
The Woolloomooloo tram line opened in stages between 1915 and 1918. This line branched off from Park Street and ran north along Haig Avenue, Sir John Young Crescent and Lincoln Crescent to Brown&#x27;s Wharf at Woolloomooloo. Through service ran from Circular Quay via Elizabeth and Park streets. The line was an early closure, in 1935, being replaced by a bus service from Pyrmont.

=== Green ban ===
In February 1973, the Builders Labourers Federation placed a two-year long green ban on the suburb to stop the destruction of low-income housing and trees. It succeeded and 65% of the houses were placed under rent control.

==Landmarks==

Woolloomooloo is home to the Finger Wharf, known for its remarkable size. It is long and wide and stands on 3,600 piles.

The Sydney Harbour Trust built the Finger Wharf, or Woolloomooloo Wharf, between 1911 and 1915 with the charter to bring order to Sydney Harbour&#x27;s foreshore facilities. The wharf became the largest wooden structure in the world. The area&#x27;s commerce was dominated by shipping at the wharf and by the regular influx of sailors and officers from the Garden Island base of the Royal Australian Navy.

The wharf&#x27;s influence diminished for Woolloomooloo during the 1970s when other more modern wharves were preferred. By the 1980s the wharf lay derelict and empty and in 1987, the state government decided to demolish the Wharf. A new complex was approved to replace the wharf in Woolloomooloo Bay, but when demolition work was due to begin in January 1991, locals blocked entrance to the site. Unions imposed a green ban, which stopped demolition crews from undertaking work.
In the mid-1990s the wharf was renovated into 300 private residential apartments and a boutique hotel with 104 guestrooms. It also has several restaurants and bars, including the popular Water Bar, frequented by many visiting celebrities. At first, the hotel was launched as &quot;W Sydney - Woolloomooloo&quot; and was the W Hotels brands&#x27; first internationally launched property outside of the United States. The hotel&#x27;s licensing expired in 2007 and rebranded as &quot;Blue Hotel&quot;, managed by Taj Hotels &amp; Resorts. Notable residents include actor Russell Crowe, who lives in a $14 million penthouse which as a result has become famous in Australia and abroad and one of the most expensive and sought after places in the country. Another prominent resident is controversial former Australian radio presenter John Laws.

Woolloomooloo is home to Artspace, an independent, not-for-profit and non-collecting residency-based contemporary art centre. Artspace is housed in the historic Gunnery Building. Devoted to the development of certain new ideas and practices in contemporary art and culture, since the early 1980s Artspace has been building a critical context for Australian and international artists, curators and writers.

The Andrew &quot;Boy&quot; Charlton Pool, sits on the western side of Woolloomooloo Bay, amongst the Royal Botanic Gardens.

<text>Spaniards, or Spanish people, are a people native to Spain. Within Spain, there are a number of national and regional ethnic identities that reflect the country&#x27;s complex history, including a number of different languages, both indigenous and local linguistic descendants of the Roman-imposed Latin language, of which Spanish is the largest and the only one that is official throughout the whole country.

Commonly spoken regional languages include, most notably, the sole surviving indigenous language of Iberia, Basque, as well as other Latin-descended Romance languages like Spanish itself, Catalan and Galician. Many populations outside Spain have ancestors who emigrated from Spain and share elements of a Hispanic culture. The most notable of these comprise Hispanic America in the Western Hemisphere.

The Roman Republic conquered Iberia during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. Hispania, the name given to Iberia by the Romans as a province of their Empire, underwent a process of linguistic and cultural Romanization, and as such, the majority of local languages in Spain today, with the exception of Basque, evolved out of Vulgar Latin which was introduced by the ancient Romans. At the end of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe, invaded the Iberian Peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces, including the Suebi, Alans and Vandals. Eventually, the Visigoths would forcibly integrate all remaining independent territories in the peninsula, including the Byzantine province of Spania, into the Visigothic Kingdom, which more or less unified politically, ecclesiastically, and legally all the former Roman provinces or successor kingdoms of what was then documented as Hispania.

In the early eighth century, the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by the Umayyad Islamic Caliphate that arrived to the peninsula in the year 711. The Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula, termed al-Andalus, soon became autonomous from Baghdad. The handful of small Christian pockets in the north left out of Muslim rule, along the presence of the Carolingian Empire near the Pyrenean range, would eventually lead to the emergence of the Christian kingdoms of León, Castile, Aragon, Portugal and Navarre. Along seven centuries, an intermittent southwards expansion of the latter kingdoms (known in historiography as the &quot;Reconquista&quot;) took place, culminating with the Christian seizure of the last Muslim polity (the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada) in 1492, the same year Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World. During the centuries after the Reconquista, the Christian kings of Spain persecuted and expelled ethnic and religious minorities such as Jews and Muslims through the Spanish Inquisition.

A process of political conglomeration among the Christian kingdoms also ensued, and the late 15th-century saw the dynastic union of Castile and Aragon under the Catholic Monarchs, generally considered the point of emergence of Spain as a unified country. The Conquest of Navarre occurred in 1512. There was also a period called Iberian Union, the dynastic union of the Kingdom of Portugal and the Spanish Crown; during which, both countries were ruled by the Spanish Habsburg kings between 1580 and 1640.

In the early modern period, Spain had one of the largest empires in history, which was also one of the first global empires, leaving a large cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 570 million Hispanophones, making Spanish the world&#x27;s second-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese. During the Golden Age there were also many advancements in the arts, with the rise of renowned painters such as Diego Velázquez. The most famous Spanish literary work, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, was also published during the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire.

The population of Spain has become more diverse due to immigration of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. From 2000 to 2010, Spain had among the highest per capita immigration rates in the world and the second-highest absolute net migration in the world (after the United States). The diverse regional and cultural populations mainly include the Castilians, Aragonese, Catalans, Andalusians, Valencians, Balearics, Canarians, Basques and the Galicians among others.

==History==
===Early populations===

The earliest modern humans inhabiting the region of Spain are believed to have been Paleolithic peoples, who may have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula as early as 35,000–40,000 years ago. The Iberians are believed to have arrived or emerged in the region as a culture between the 4th millennium BC and the 3rd millennium BC, settling initially along the Mediterranean coast.

Then Celts settled in Spain during the Iron Age. Some of those tribes in North-central Spain, who had cultural contact with the Iberians, are called Celtiberians. In addition, a group known as the Tartessians and later Turdetanians inhabited southwestern Spain. They are believed to have developed a separate culture influenced by Phoenicia. The seafaring Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians successively settled trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast over a period of several centuries. Interaction took place with Indigenous peoples. The Second Punic War between the Carthaginians and Romans was fought mainly in what is now Spain and Portugal.

The Roman Republic conquered Iberia during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and established a series of Latin-speaking provinces in the region. As a result of Roman colonization, the majority of local languages, with the exception of Basque, stem from the Vulgar Latin that was spoken in Hispania (Roman Iberia). A new group of Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula including Spanish, which eventually became the main language in Spain evolved from Roman expansion. Hispania emerged as an important part of the Roman Empire and produced notable historical figures such as Trajan, Hadrian, Seneca, Martial, Theodosius, and Quintilian.

The Germanic Vandals and Suebi, with Iranian Alans under King Respendial, arrived in the peninsula in 409 AD. Part of the Vandals with the remaining Alans, now under Geiseric, removed to North Africa after a few conflicts with another Germanic tribe, the Visigoths. The latter were established in Toulouse and supported Roman campaigns against the Vandals and Alans in 415–19 AD.

The Visigoths became the dominant power in Iberia and reigned for three centuries. They were highly romanized in the eastern Empire and already Christians, so they became fully integrated into the late Iberian-Roman culture.

The Suebi were another Germanic tribe in the west of the peninsula; some sources said that they became established as &quot;federates&quot; of the Roman Empire in the old Northwestern Roman province of Gallaecia (roughly, present-day northern Portugal and Galicia). But they were largely independent and raided neighboring provinces to expand their political control over ever-larger portions of the southwest after the Vandals and Alans left. They created a totally independent Suebic Kingdom. In 447 AC they converted to Roman Catholicism under King Rechila.

After being checked and reduced in 456 AD by the Visigoths, the Suebic Kingdom survived to 585 AD. It was decimated as an independent political unit by the Visigoths, after having been involved in the internal affairs of their kingdom.

===Middle Ages===
After two centuries of domination by the Visigothic Kingdom, the Iberian Peninsula was invaded by a Muslim force under Tariq Bin Ziyad in 711. This army consisted mainly of ethnic Berbers from the Ghomara tribe, who were reinforced by Arabs from Syria once the conquest was complete. Only a remote mountainous area in the far north retained independence, eventually developing as the Christian Kingdom of Asturias.

Muslim Iberia became part of the Umayyad Caliphate and would be known as Al-Andalus. The Berbers of Al Andalus revolted as early as 740 AD, halting Arab expansion across the Pyrenee Mountains into France. Upon the collapse of the Umayyad in Damascus, Spain was seized by Yusuf al Fihri. The exiled Umayyad Prince Abd al-Rahman I next seized power, establishing himself as Emir of Cordoba. Abd al Rahman III, his grandson, proclaimed a Caliphate in 929, marking the beginning of the Golden Age of Al Andalus. This policy was the effective power of the peninsula and Western North Africa; it competed with the Shiite rulers of Tunis and frequently raided the small Christian kingdoms in the North.

The Caliphate of Córdoba effectively collapsed during a ruinous civil war between 1009 and 1013; it was not finally abolished until 1031, when al-Andalus broke up into a number of mostly independent mini-states and principalities called &quot;taifas.&quot; These were generally too weak to defend themselves against repeated raids and demands for tribute from the Christian states to the north and west, which were known to the Muslims as &quot;the Galician nations&quot;. These had expanded from their initial strongholds in Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the Carolingian Marca Hispanica to become the Kingdoms of Navarre, León, Portugal, Castile and Aragon, and the County of Barcelona. Eventually they began to conquer territory, and the Taifa kings asked for help from the Almoravids, Muslim Berber rulers of the Maghreb. But the Almoravids went on to conquer and annex all the Taifa kingdoms.

In 1086 the Almoravid ruler of Morocco, Yusuf ibn Tashfin, was invited by the Muslim princes in Iberia to defend them against Alfonso VI, King of Castile and León. In that year, Tashfin crossed the straits to Algeciras and inflicted defeat on the Christian army at the Battle of Sagrajas. By 1094, Yusuf ibn Tashfin had removed all Muslim princes in Iberia and had annexed their states, except for the one at Zaragoza. He also regained Valencia from the Christians. About this time a massive process of conversion to Islam took place, and Muslims comprised the majority of the population in Spain by the end of the 11th century.

The Almoravids were succeeded by the Almohads, another Berber dynasty, after the victory of Abu Yusuf Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur over the Castilian Alfonso VIII at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195. In 1212 a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. But the Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of Abu Ya&#x27;qub Yusuf II rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but weakened, were quickly conquered by the kingdoms of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of Murcia (1243) and the Algarve (1249), only the Emirate of Granada survived as a Muslim state, tributary of Castile until 1492.

In 1469 the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile signaled a joining of forces to attack and conquer the Emirate of Granada. The King and Queen convinced the Pope to declare their war a crusade. The Christians were successful and finally, in January 1492, after a long siege, the Moorish sultan Muhammad XII surrendered the fortress palace, the renowned Alhambra.

Spain conquered the Canary Islands between 1402 and 1496. Their indigenous Berber population, the Guanches, were gradually absorbed by intermarrying with Spanish settlers.

Spanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre was begun by Ferdinand II of Aragon and completed by Charles V. The series of military campaigns extended from 1512 to 1524, while the war lasted until 1528 in the Navarre to the north of the Pyrenees. Between 1568 and 1571, Charles V armies fought and defeated a general insurrection of the Muslims of the mountains of Granada. Charles V then ordered the expulsion of up to 80,000 Granadans from the province and their dispersal throughout Spain.

The union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as the conquest of Granada, Navarre and the Canary Islands led to the formation of the Spanish state as known today. This allowed for the development of a Spanish identity based on the Spanish language and a local form of Catholicism. This gradually developed in a territory that remained culturally, linguistically and religiously very diverse.

A majority of Jews were forcibly converted to Catholicism during the 14th and 15th centuries and those remaining were expelled from Spain in 1492. The open practice of Islam by Spain&#x27;s sizeable Mudejar population was similarly outlawed. Furthermore, between 1609 and 1614, a significant number of Moriscos— (Muslims who had been baptized Catholic) were expelled by royal decree. Although initial estimates of the number of Moriscos expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion has been increasingly challenged by modern historians. Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were highest, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.

The Islamic legacy in Spain has been long lasting, and among many others, accounts for two of the eight masterpieces of Islamic architecture from around the world: the Alhambra of Granada and the Cordoba Mosque; the Palmeral of Elche is listed as a World Heritage Site due to its uniqueness.

Those who avoided expulsion or who managed to return to Spain merged into the dominant culture. The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for crypto-Islamic practices took place in Granada in 1727, with most of those convicted receiving relatively light sentences. By the end of the 18th century, Indigenous Islam and Morisco identity were considered to have been extinguished in Spain.

===Colonialism and emigration===

In the 16th century, following the military conquest of most of the new continent, perhaps 240,000 Spaniards entered American ports. They were joined by 450,000 in the next century. It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492–1832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850–1950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. After the conquest of Mexico and Peru these two regions became the principal destinations of Spanish colonial settlers in the 16th century. In the period 1850–1950, 3.5 million Spanish left for the Americas, particularly Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, and Cuba. From 1840 to 1890, as many as 40,000 Canary Islanders emigrated to Venezuela. 94,000 Spaniards chose to go to Algeria in the last years of the 19th century, and 250,000 Spaniards lived in Morocco at the beginning of the 20th century.

By the end of the Spanish Civil War, some 500,000 Spanish Republican refugees had crossed
the border into France. From 1961 to 1974, at the height of the guest worker in Western Europe, about 100,000 Spaniards emigrated each year. The nation has formally apologized to expelled Jews and since 2015 offers the chance for people to reclaim Spanish citizenship. By 2019, over 132,000 Sephardic Jewish descendants had reclaimed Spanish citizenship.

The population of Spain has become more diverse due to immigration of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. From 2000 to 2010, Spain had among the highest per capita immigration rates in the world and the second-highest absolute net migration in the world (after the United States). Immigrants now make up about 10% of the population. But Spain&#x27;s prolonged economic crisis between 2008 and 2015 reduced economic opportunities, and both immigration rates and the total number of foreigners in the country declined. By the end of this period, Spain was becoming a net emigrant country.

==Ancestry==
===Historical origins and genetics===

Spanish people, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from populations associated with the Paleolithic Epigravettian culture; Neolithic Early European Farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago; and Yamnaya Steppe herders who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Ukraine and southern Russia in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.

The Spanish people&#x27;s genetic pool largely derives from the pre-Roman inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula:

*Pre-Indo-European and Indo-European speaking pre-Celtic groups: (Iberians, Vettones, Turdetani, Aquitani).
*Celts (Gallaecians, Celtiberians, Turduli and Celtici), who were Romanized after the conquest of the region by the ancient Romans.

There are also some genetic influences from Germanic tribes who arrived after the Roman period, including the Suebi, Hasdingi Vandals, Alans and Visigoths. Due to its position on the Mediterranean Sea, like other Southern European countries, the land that is now Spain also had contact with other Mediterranean peoples such as the ancient Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians who briefly settled along the Iberian Mediterranean coast, the Sephardi Jewish community, and Berbers and Arabs arrived during Al-Andalus, all of them leaving some North African and Middle Eastern genetic contributions, particularly in the Southern and Western Iberian Peninsula.

==Peoples of Spain==
===Nationalities and regions===
Within Spain, there are various nationalities and regional populations including the Andalusians, Castilians, Catalans, Valencians and Balearics (who speak Catalan, a distinct Romance language in eastern Spain), the Basques (who live in the Basque country and north of Navarre and speak Basque, a non-Indo-European language), and the Galicians (who speak Galician, a descendant of old Galician-Portuguese).

Respect to the existing cultural pluralism is important to many Spaniards. In many regions there exist strong regional identities such as Asturias, Aragon, the Canary Islands, León, and Andalusia, while in others (like Catalonia, Basque Country or Galicia) there are stronger national sentiments. Many of them refuse to identify themselves with the Spanish ethnic group and prefer some of the following:

;Nationalities and regional identities
===Romani minority===

Spain is home to one of the largest communities of Romani people (commonly known by the English exonym &quot;gypsies&quot;, Spanish: ). The Spanish Roma, which belong to the Iberian Kale subgroup (&quot;calé&quot;), are a formerly-nomadic community, which spread across Western Asia, North Africa, and Europe, first reaching Spain in the 15th century.

Data on ethnicity is not collected in Spain, although the Government&#x27;s statistical agency CIS estimated in 2007 that the number of present in Spain is probably around one million. Most Spanish Roma live in the autonomous community of Andalusia, where they have traditionally enjoyed a higher degree of integration than in the rest of the country. A number of Spanish Calé also live in Southern France, especially in the region of Perpignan.

===Modern immigration===

The population of Spain has become increasingly diverse due to recent immigration. From 2000 to 2010, Spain had among the highest per capita immigration rates in the world and the second highest absolute net migration in the World (after the United States) and immigrants now make up about 10% of the population. Since 2000, Spain has absorbed more than 3 million immigrants, with thousands more arriving each year. In 2008, the immigrant population topped over 4.5 million. These immigrants came mainly from Europe, Latin America, Asia, North Africa, and West Africa.

==Languages==

Languages spoken in Spain include Spanish (&quot;castellano&quot; or &quot;español&quot;) (74%), Catalan (&quot;català&quot;, called &quot;valencià&quot;, in the Valencian Community) (17%), Galician (&quot;galego&quot;) (7%), and Basque (&quot;euskara&quot;) (2%). Other languages with a lower level of official recognition are Asturian (&quot;asturianu&quot;), Aranese Gascon (&quot;aranés&quot;), Aragonese (&quot;aragonés&quot;), and Leonese, each with their own various dialects. Spanish is the official state language, although the other languages are co-official in a number of autonomous communities.

Peninsular Spanish is typically classified in northern and southern dialects; among the southern ones Andalusian Spanish is particularly important. The Canary Islands have a distinct dialect of Spanish which is close to Caribbean Spanish. The Spanish language is a Romance language and is one of the aspects (including laws and general &quot;ways of life&quot;) that causes Spaniards to be labelled a Latin people. Spanish has a significant Arabic influence in vocabulary; between the 8th and 12th centuries, Arabic was the dominant language in Al-Andalus and some 4,000 words are of Arabic origin, including nouns, verbs and adjectives. It also has influences from other Romance languages such as French, Italian, Catalan, Galician or Portuguese. Traditionally, the Basque language has been considered a key influence on Spanish, though nowadays this is questioned. Other changes are borrowings from English and other Germanic languages, although English influence is stronger in Latin America than in Spain.

The number of speakers of Spanish as a mother tongue is roughly 35.6 million, while the vast majority of other groups in Spain such as the Galicians, Catalans, and Basques also speak Spanish as a first or second language, which boosts the number of Spanish speakers to the overwhelming majority of Spain&#x27;s population of 46 million.

Spanish was exported to the Americas due to over three centuries of Spanish colonial rule starting with the arrival of Christopher Columbus to Santo Domingo in 1492. Spanish is spoken natively by over 400 million people and spans across most countries of the Americas; from the Southwestern United States in North America down to Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost region of South America in Chile and Argentina. A variety of the language, known as Judaeo-Spanish or Ladino (or Haketia in Morocco), is still spoken by descendants of Sephardim (Spanish and Portuguese Jews) who fled Spain following a decree of expulsion of practising Jews in 1492. Also, a Spanish creole language known as Chabacano, which developed by the mixing of Spanish and native Tagalog and Cebuano languages during Spain&#x27;s rule of the country through Mexico from 1565 to 1898, is spoken in the Philippines (by roughly 1 million people).

==Religion==

Roman Catholicism is by far the largest denomination present in Spain, although its share of the population has been decreasing for decades. According to a study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research in 2013 about 71% of Spaniards self-identified as Catholics, 2% other faith, and about 25% identified as atheists or declared they had no religion. Survey data for 2019 show Catholics down to 69%, 2.8% &quot;other faith&quot; and 27% atheist-agnostic-non-believers.

==Emigration from Spain==


Outside of Europe, Latin America has the largest population of people with ancestors from Spain. These include people of full or partial Spanish ancestry.

===People with Spanish ancestry===
The listing above shows the nine countries with known collected data on people with ancestors from Spain, although the definitions of each of these are somewhat different and the numbers cannot really be compared. Spanish Chilean of Chile and Spanish Uruguayan of Uruguay could be included by percentage (each at above 40%) instead of numeral size.

<doc id="963153" wikidata="Q726263" url="?curid=963153" title="Painkiller (Judas Priest album)">
<text>Painkiller is the twelfth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 17 September 1990, and 18 September in the United States. It was the last Judas Priest album to feature long-time lead singer Rob Halford until his return for the 2005 album &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot; and the first to feature drummer Scott Travis.

==Recording and music==
&quot;Painkiller&quot; is the first Judas Priest album to feature drummer Scott Travis, who replaced long-time drummer Dave Holland in 1989. Travis was previously a member of Los Angeles band Racer X and with his heavy use of double kicks, Travis gave Judas Priest a new sound and heavier edge. &quot;Painkiller&quot; was described as heavy metal and, due to its relatively intense sound, speed metal.

The album was recorded at Miraval Studios, Brignoles, France in early 1990 and mixed at Wisseloord Studios, Hilversum, the Netherlands later that year. It was produced by the band and Chris Tsangarides, marking the first time since 1978&#x27;s &quot;Killing Machine&quot; that Judas Priest had not worked with Tom Allom and the first time since 1976&#x27;s &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; that Judas Priest and Tsangarides worked together.

Don Airey was brought in to play keyboards on &quot;A Touch of Evil&quot;. In a 2020 interview, Airey revealed that he also doubled most of the album&#x27;s bass parts on a Minimoog synthesizer. 

==Release==
Despite the album being finished in March 1990, the album&#x27;s release was delayed due to the pending, much-publicized subliminal message trial that began on 16 July 1990. The band was the subject of a civil lawsuit alleging their recording was responsible for the suicide attempts of two young men in Reno, Nevada on 23 December 1985. The case was eventually dismissed on 24 August 1990. With the trial behind them, the band finally released the album on 17 September 1990 on LP, cassette and CD.

The album was certified Gold by RIAA in January 1991. A remastered CD was released in May 2001, including a live recording of &quot;Leather Rebel&quot; and a previously unreleased song, &quot;Living Bad Dreams&quot;. The album received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Metallica&#x27;s cover of the Queen song &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical reaction to &quot;Painkiller&quot; has been overwhelmingly positive, especially from the metal community. Steve Huey of AllMusic, praised the album, saying that it was one of Judas Priest&#x27;s best albums in years adding that &quot;Travis&#x27; thunderous (and crisp-sounding) percussive maelstrom lights an immediate fire under the bandmembers&#x27; asses; Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing tear through a crushing, diabolical riff; and Rob Halford starts shrieking like a wicked witch, giving perhaps the most malevolent-sounding performance of his career. It&#x27;s a startling statement of musical purpose that arrived seemingly out of nowhere, heralding a comeback that rivals George Foreman&#x27;s.&quot; Mikesn of Sputnikmusic gave the album a 5 out of 5, stating that &quot;Painkiller is full of many memorable riffs and leads from Glenn and K.K. Among the finest moments of the album come from the intense riffing combined with Halford&#x27;s wailing vocals. The songs found on Painkiller are very energetic from start to finish, and each member seems to feed off each other&#x27;s performances.&quot; On metal-archives.com, the album holds an average score of 92% based on 26 reviews.

Most of the album&#x27;s tracks were performed live on the Painkiller World Tour, with the title track becoming one of the band&#x27;s concert staples. &quot;Hell Patrol&quot;, &quot;All Guns Blazing&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Evil&quot;, &quot;Night Crawler&quot; and &quot;Between the Hammer and the Anvil&quot; have all returned to the setlist on later tours, while &quot;Metal Meltdown&quot; and &quot;Leather Rebel&quot; were retired after only a few performances in 1990. &quot;One Shot at Glory&quot; and its intro &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; were the only songs on the album that had not been played live until August 2021, when they were included in Judas Priest&#x27;s set at the Bloodstock Open Air festival.

==Rob Halford&#x27;s departure==
Following the tour for this album, singer Rob Halford left the band in May 1992 and maintained little contact with his former bandmates throughout the 1990s. The reason for this was growing tensions within the band, along with Halford&#x27;s desire to explore new musical territory by creating a new band of his own, Fight. Contractually, Halford was required to leave Judas Priest to allow sales of any Fight material. Judas Priest remained inactive for several years after Halford had gone; however, the band would eventually re-vamp, record, and tour, recruiting new singer Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens in 1996, who would perform on the studio albums &quot;Jugulator&quot; and &quot;Demolition&quot;.

<doc id="963154" wikidata="Q6130715" url="?curid=963154" title="Jim Greenwood (American politician)">
<text>James Charles Greenwood (born May 4, 1951) is an American politician in the Republican Party. He represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s Eighth Congressional District for six terms in the United States House of Representatives.

Greenwood became president and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) in 2004.

==Personal life==

Greenwood was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Holland, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Dickinson College with a B.A. in sociology in 1973, served as an aide to state representative John S. Renninger and as a houseparent for children with intellectual disabilities and emotional disorders. From 1977 until 1980, he was a caseworker for the Bucks County Children and Youth Social Service Agency, working with abused and neglected children.

He and his wife, Tina, have four children.

==Political career==

Greenwood served as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 143rd district from 1981 to 1986 and the Pennsylvania Senate for the 10th district from 1987 to 1992. In 1992, Greenwood defeated Democratic Congressman Peter H. Kostmayer for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Pennsylvania&#x27;s 8th district.

As a centrist with libertarian views on social issues and conservative stances on taxes and economic issues, Greenwood&#x27;s overall voting record was moderate. He was known as an effective legislator. He voted against two of the four impeachment charges against President Bill Clinton in 1998, and sided with the House Democrats to oppose Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003. He also served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. In this role, he led investigations and held hearings on a variety of issues within the vast jurisdiction of the Committee including corporate governance, bioterrorism, port and border security, drug importation, and the safety of nuclear power plants.

A co-founder and co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus, Greenwood was the author of comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to preserve, protect, and research ocean resources. He also worked to increase communication among world leaders to address international environmental issues. As a member of the Education and Workforce Committee, he was a leading voice in the efforts to ensure that sufficient federal funds were appropriated to meet the needs of children in special education programs and to prevent school violence.

Greenwood announced in the midst of the 2004 congressional election that he would not seek re-election and retire. He had already won the 8th district&#x27;s Republican primary, and his abrupt withdrawal raised many questions. Greenwood released a statement saying: &quot;From time to time during my twenty four years of public service, I have been approached and offered other types of challenges and opportunities. Such has been the case in the last few days, and I am currently reviewing one of these opportunities. I will make my decision public in the very near future and will have no other statement until then.&quot; Bucks County Commissioner Mike Fitzpatrick was selected as the new Republican nominee in a special party convention, and went on to win the general election.

After serving six terms in Congress, Greenwood was appointed president and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), a biotechnology trade association based in Washington, DC.

==After politics==

Greenwood was the president and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) from 2005 to 2020. BIO represents more than 1,200 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers, and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO members are involved in the research and development of healthcare, agriculture, industrial and environmental biotechnology products.

In addition to his work with BIO, Greenwood is a member of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group that advocates and encourages changes to U.S. policy to make national biodefense systems stronger. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33-step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former senator Joe Lieberman and former governor Tom Ridge, the study panel assembled in Washington, D.C., for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The study panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel&#x27;s final report, &quot;The National Blueprint for Biodefense&quot;, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the vice president authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the panel&#x27;s call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.

Greenwood is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s advisory board. Greenwood is also a member of Marine Conservation Biology Institute&#x27;s board of directors. In 2014, Greenwood joined the board of directors of the National Audubon Society. Additionally, he is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Electoral history==

Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1996, write-ins received 12 votes. In 1998, Natural Law candidate Carolyn Boyce received 1,022 votes and write-ins received 15 votes. In 2002, write-ins received 34 votes.

<text>Messier 46 or M46, also known as NGC 2437, is an open cluster of stars in the slightly southern constellation of Puppis. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1771. Dreyer described it as &quot;very bright, very rich, very large.&quot; It is about 5,000 light-years away. There are an estimated 500 stars in the cluster with a combined mass of , and it is thought to be a mid-range estimate of 251.2 million years old.

The cluster has a very broadest (tidal) radius of and core radius of . It has a greater spatial extent in infrared than in visible light, suggesting it is undergoing some mass segregation with the fainter (redder) stars migrating to a coma (tail) region. The fainter stars that extend out to the south and west may form a tidal tail due to a past interaction.

The planetary nebula NGC 2438 appears to lie within the cluster near its northern edge (the faint almost rainbow array of colored smudge at the top-center of the image), but it is most likely unrelated since it does not share the cluster&#x27;s radial velocity. This makes for superimposed objects of interest, another instance perhaps being NGC 2818.
On the other hand, the illuminating star of the bipolar Calabash Nebula shares the radial velocity and proper motion of Messier 46, and is at the same distance, so is a bona fide member of the open cluster.

M46 is located close by to another open cluster, Messier 47. M46 is about a degree east of M47 in the sky, so the two fit well in a binocular or wide-angle telescope field.

<doc id="963184" wikidata="Q2054431" url="?curid=963184" title="Ickleton">
<text>Ickleton is a village and civil parish about south of Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England. The village is beside the River Cam, close to where a southern branch of the Icknield Way crossed the river. The eastern and southern boundaries of the parish form part of the county boundary with Essex, and the Essex town of Saffron Walden is only about southeast of the village.

The village is mainly grouped around three streets: Abbey Street, Frogge Street, and Church Street, which leads into Brookhampton Street. The village is at the eastern end of its parish, which extends to the west.

==Archaeology==
A Neolithic axe-head has been found in the parish, suggesting a human presence before 2500 BC.

About southwest of the village near Valance Farm is a late Bronze Age bowl barrow, close to the supposed route of the pre-Roman Icknield Way. The barrow and its surrounding ditch are well-preserved, about in diameter and high. Other Bronze Age remains found in the parish include a spear-head, a gold bracelet and a torq. South of the village on the side of Coploe Hill is a series of earth banks that may also be Bronze Age. They start about south of the village and extend south, as far as the Essex county boundary.

About south of the parish church, just west of Frogge Street, is the site of a Roman villa. The site is just across the River Cam from the site of a Roman fort at Great Chesterford. The villa was of modest size, and it had an outhouse or barn. The site was excavated in 1842.

About north of the village, just over the boundary in Duxford parish, is the site of a Romano-British settlement.

==Manors==

There are records of continuous Anglo-Saxon settlement at Ickleton for at least 1,000 years. Its toponym is derived from Old English, meaning &quot;Icel&#x27;s farm&quot; or &quot;estate associated with a man named Icel&quot;.

In the late 10th or early 11th century Elfhelm of Wratting, a thegn of King Edgar the Peaceful, left one hide of land at &quot;Icelingtune&quot; to his kinsman, also called Elfhelm. In the reign of Edward the Confessor in the middle of the 11th century, 20 hides of land were being farmed in the parish. Squitrebil held 19 of them from the King, and Estred held the other hide from Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia.

After the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, almost all English estates were taken from their owners and granted to Norman barons. In 1067 William the Conqueror granted the manor of &quot;Hichelintone&quot; to Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, making Ickleton part of the Honour of Boulogne. The Domesday Book of 1086 records 43 tenants in the parish,

In 1125 Stephen of Blois and Eustace II&#x27;s granddaughter, Matilda of Boulogne, were married, making Stephen Count of Boulogne &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. In 1135 Stephen became King of England and in 1141 he granted Ickleton to Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex. However, Mandeville became an outlaw in 1143 and was killed in 1144, and Ickleton seems to have reverted to the Crown.

In about 1150 Stephen and Maud granted Ickleton to Eupheme, second wife of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, as a wedding present. In about 1153 Eupheme granted £5 worth of land at Ickleton to Colne Priory. By the end of that year Eupheme had died and the rest of Ickleton seems to have reverted to the Honour of Boulogne. When William I, Count of Boulogne died in 1159, King Henry II took possession of the Honour.

Variations in spelling the village name may include &#x27;Igyllyngton&#x27;, as seen in 1460. 
===Lesser estates===
There was a number of smaller manors in the parish.

====Valence or Vallance====
By 1162 the hospital at Montmorillon in Poitou, France held an estate at Ickleton. The steward of William I, Count of Boulogne had granted the land, and the Hundred Rolls of 1279 recorded that it covered about and was tenanted by one Thomas the deacon. In 1300 Montmorillon hospital conveyed the estate to Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. In 1305 Thomas relinquished his tenancy, and the Earl granted the estate to a Sir John Wollaston for the rest of the latter&#x27;s life. When the Earl died in 1324 he left the estate to his granddaughter Elizabeth de Comyn, but it continued to be called the Valence manor. Elizabeth and her husband Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot sold the manor in 1332 and it changed hands again in 1333, 1334 and 1344. In 1344 Valence manor was bought jointly by John Illegh, who was rector of Icklingham, Suffolk and Thomas Keningham, a fellow of Michaelhouse, Cambridge. In 1345 Illegh made over his share of the estate to Michaelhouse.

In 1546 during the Reformation Michaelhouse was dissolved by Act of Parliament, along with King&#x27;s Hall, Cambridge, and the two were merged to form Trinity College, Cambridge. The Valence manor was granted to the new college, and in 1612 it was expanded to . When Ickleton parish was inclosed in 1814 Trinity College was allotted , which was named Vallance Farm. It increased this to by 1946, when Vallance Farm was sold.

There was a Valence manor house by 1324, and there are subsequent records of it in 1461 and 1508. It may have been the same as the Valence manor house recorded in 1612, 1685 and 1726 on the south side of Mill Lane. It was a substantial house with six rooms on the ground floor and two solars upstairs. The present Vallance farm in Grange Road has a brick farmhouse built in about 1825 for Trinity College&#x27;s tenant.

====Hovells====
By 1183 Ralph Brito held land at Ickleton of the Honour of Boulogne. By 1221 it had passed by marriage to Robert Hovel, whose bride was the daughter of Ralph&#x27;s heir Thomas Brito. In 1222 a William Brito released a carucate of land to Hovel. The small estate passed to a Ralph Hovel and came to be called Hovells Manor. In 1253 Ralph Hovel confirmed a grant of of land, apparently Hovells Manor at Ickleton, to the Cistercian Tilty Abbey in Essex. Certainly Tilty Abbey held Hovells Manor by 1279, when the Hundred Rolls recorded that it covered . Under the feudal system Tilty Abbey held the estate of Robert Hovel, who in turn held it of the Honour of Boulogne.

The present Hovells house in Frogge Street was the manor house. It is an early 16th-century timber-framed building, altered and extended in the 17th century.

====Durham&#x27;s====
By 1199 Hamon Walter, a younger brother of Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler and the Archbishop of Canterbury Hubert Walter had granted a small estate at Ickleton called Durhams Manor to the Premonstratensian West Dereham Abbey in Norfolk. In about 1235 it was assessed at one hide. The Hundred Rolls record that in 1279 the Abbey held in Ickleton about &quot;of Robert the son of Ryenold the knight&quot; and possibly of Ickleton Priory. The present Durham&#x27;s Farmhouse in Butcher&#x27;s Hill is a late 16th-century timber-framed building with 17th-century or later additions.

====Caldress or Caldrees====
Before 1213 the Cistercian Calder Abbey in Cumberland had received land and half a watermill at Ickleton from Richard de Luci. The estate came to be called Caldress Manor after the Abbey, which in 1279 held it of Thomas de Multon. This would seem to be the Thomas de Multon who was a descendant of Thomas de Multon, Lord de Luci, father of Thomas de Multon, 1st Baron Multon of Gilsland and died in 1287.

The present Caldress Manor house in Abbey Street may have 16th- or 17th-century origins. It was added to in about 1800. Later in the 19th century the house was altered again for Robert Herbert, first Premier of Queensland, Australia, who was born in Ickleton. The original part of the house is timber-framed and the additions are brick.

====Brays====
In 1279 John le Bray held land at Ickleton, and in 1302 the same or a later John le Bray held land at Ickleton of the Honour of Boulogne. By 1346 the holding had passed to a John Sawston but it was still called Brays manor. It then passed through different owners and the record of succession is incomplete until 1523. In 1604 a member of the Crudd family (see &quot;Mowbrays&quot;, below) bought much of the land, and by 1704 Brays and Mowbrays manors were owned by the same Thomas Crudd. He died unmarried in 1714, leaving both manors to the Hanchett family, into which two of his sisters had married. In the inclosure of 1814 Samuel Hanchett was allotted . Brays stayed in the Hanchett family until it was sold in 1867. Robert Herbert (see &quot;Caldress or Caldrees&quot;, above) bought part of the land but sold much of it in 1873.

There was a messuage with Brays manor in 1279, but by 1545 the house on the site had gone. By 1730 the house for the manor was Little Farm, east of the churchyard. This was later combined with the house next door to form Norman Hall, which in 1867 was sold and ceased to be a farmhouse. The oldest part of Norman Hall is not Norman at all but a 15th-century timber-framed medieval hall with a cross-wing. It was altered in the 16th century and added to in the 18th and 19th centuries. The exterior is finished with a combination of flint, brick and 18th-century pargetting.

====Limburys====
By 1279 Roger de Neville held about of demesne under Thomas de Multon. In 1302 Philip de Neville held of a knight&#x27;s fee at Ickleton, which by 1316 had passed to Sir John Limbury. In 1335 Sir John was Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and held at Ickleton of the de Multons. The estate passed to Sir John&#x27;s heirs and descendants and came to be called Limburys manor. In 1433 Elizabeth, Lady Swinburne (née Limbury) died and in 1456 her executor sold the manor with about to Clare Hall, Cambridge.

Limbury manor had a messuage by 1279 and two in 1388 and 1389. In 1545 the farmstead was in Frog Street. In 1704 the farm-buildings were still there but there was no house. After Clare Hall bought Mowbrays manor in 1819 it let Limburys and Mowbrays together and the tenants lived at Mowbrays (see below). The present house called Limburys is a flint rubblestone house in Abbey Street dating probably from the early to mid 19th century.

====Mowbrays====
In 1279 the heirs of a William de Beauchamp of Bedford held at Ickleton of West Dereham Abbey (see above). This descended by a female heir to the Mowbray family, and when John de Mowbray, 4th Baron Mowbray died in 1368 is estate included 30 acres at Ickleton held of the Honour of Boulogne. He left the estate to his son Thomas, who in 1397 was created 1st Duke of Norfolk. The manor stayed in the Mowbray family until John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk and his wife Elizabeth conveyed it to feoffees in 1469.

The estate continued to be called Mowbrays manor, and in the 1540s it was among lands bought by an Ickleton yeoman, John Crudd, who enlarged the estate. Mowbrays descended in the Crudd family and its heirs the Hanchett, Warner and Brooke families. A Mrs Brooke held more than in 1810 and died leaving the estate to her children in 1812. They were allocated south of the village in the inclosure of 1814, which they then sold to Clare College, Cambridge in 1819. The college still owned the farm in 1972.

Mowbrays seems to have had no manor house in the 14th century but there may have been one in 1438. The present house called Mowbrays in Church Street is a late 15th- or early 16th-century timber-framed, jettied, gabled building, which originally had a central hall and two cross-wings. Late in the 17th century it was raised to two storeys and a west wing was added. Red-brick diagonal chimneystacks were built, which have the date 1690 scratched on them. The back of the house is decorated with pargetting. Mowbrays is a Grade II* listed building.

===Later history===
After 1538 the manors of Hovells, Caldress and Durhams, along with the estate of the former Ickleton Priory (see below) descended together, but legally remained separate entities. In 1600 Martin Heton, the new Bishop of Ely, surrendered the four manors to the Crown, which in 1602 sold them to a John Wood of nearby Hinxton, who had already been leasing the land. In 1623 Wood sold the combined estate to the Holgate family of Saffron Walden, with whom it remained until at least 1717.

By 1719 the Holgates had sold the estate to the Irish peer Henry O&#x27;Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond. Ickleton was inherited by the 8th Earl&#x27;s nephew Percy Wyndham-O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond in 1741 and by George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont in 1774. The 3rd Earl gave Ickleton to his younger brother the Hon. Percy Charles Wyndham in 1784, who thereafter lived at Caldress Manor.

In 1833 Wyndham left Ickleton Manor to his nephew Algernon Herbert, an Oxford scholar and antiquary who became a barrister of the Inner Temple. Herbert died at Ickleton in 1855, leaving the manor to his young son Robert Herbert (born 1831), who also became a barrister at the Inner Temple but made his career as a colonial civil servant. Robert (later Sir Robert) Herbert never married, and died at Ickleton in 1905 leaving the manor to a descendant of his uncle Rev. William Herbert. The estate eventually descended to William Herbert&#x27;s great-grandson Percy Mundy, who died in 1959.

==Priory, weekly market and annual fair==
Ickleton Priory was a small house of Benedictine nuns, founded in the mid-12th century. It existed certainly by 1181 and may have been founded in or before 1163. The priory was dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. The priory was neither large nor wealthy, but it became Ickleton&#x27;s principal manor and dominated the life of the parish. By 1536 it held of the cultivated land in the parish, but in that year the priory was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the last prioress was pensioned off by the Crown.

A charter issued under Henry III between 1222 and 1227 granted the prioress the right to hold at Ickleton a weekly market, an annual fair and a court leet. The charter may have been in confirmation of an earlier one that the priory claimed was granted by King Stephen. The market was every Thursday and the annual fair was on the feast of St Mary Magdalene, 22 July.

The annual fair survived the priory&#x27;s suppression. In the latter part of the 16th century it was still being held in the former priory&#x27;s barnyard, still took place around the feast day of St Mary Magdalene, and lasted five days. In the 18th and early 19th century it was a one-day event on the feast day itself, trading mainly in horses and cheese. In 1872 the fair was owned by the farmer of Abbey Farm when the Home Secretary, Henry Bruce, abolished Ickleton Fair under the Fairs Act 1871.

==Rectory==
In the Middle Ages the parish rectory lands were appropriated to Ickleton Priory and treated as a single estate with the priory&#x27;s own lands. When the priory was suppressed in 1536 the combined estate passed to the Crown (see above) so the rectory continued only as tithes from the parishioners. In 1547 the Crown granted Ickleton rectory to the Dean and Canons of Windsor. By 1579 the Wood family, tenants of the demesne, were in dispute with the Dean and Canons over tithe payments. The dispute was still continuing in 1620, despite consistent court judgement in favour of the Dean and Canons. Eventually the tithes were commuted from payment in kind to money in lieu. In 1776 the Dean and Canons proposed reverting to payments in kind, to which the villagers objected. In the inclosure of 1814 the Dean and Canons received in lieu of tithes.

The Dean and Canons leased the rectory and hence the tithe income. Lesees included the Dean of Arches, William Bird from 1615 to 1624 and Sir William Acton, 1st Baronet from 1630. Lessees after the inclosure of 1814 included Lieutenant-General William Inglis in 1861–62. In 1867 the Dean and Canons&#x27; estates were vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The Commissioners sold the estate in 1920.

==Places of worship==
===Church of England===
The Anglican parish church is St Mary Magdalene Church, Ickleton.

===Early Dissenters===
By 1669 a few villagers in Ickleton were Dissenters, probably Quakers. The number of Dissenters slowly grew, and in 1690 they invited two ministers from Cambridge to preach at Ickleton every third Sunday. Their numbers remained small throughout the 18th century, for most of which time they used a barn as their meeting-place. The congregation had no resident minister, relying instead on ministers from Cambridge, Linton and Saffron Walden.

===Congregationalism===
In 1842 a Congregational chapel and schoolhouse were built in Ickleton. The chapel was successful enough to be enlarged in 1876 and 1896, after which it could seat 200 people and was served fortnightly by the Congregational minister from Duxford. It was closed in about 1954, sold in 1956 and derelict by 1972.

===Methodism===
In 1824 there were Methodists meeting in two houses in Ickleton. The 1851 Census recorded 80 people meeting for evening worship led by a Primitive Methodist minister from Saffron Walden. The Primitive Methodist chapel in Abbey Street was built the following year, in 1852. It could seat 160 people, and in 1877 had 95 people in its congregation. The chapel was still in use for worship in 1972 but has since closed.

===Salvation Army===
The Salvation Army briefly ministered in Ickleton, having a hall that was recorded in 1899 and 1903.

==Economic and social history==
===Population===
The number of Ickleton&#x27;s inhabitants has been in the low hundreds throughout its history. Early documents record the number of tenants, households or adults rather than total population, so there are no precise figures until the 1801 Census. The number of tenants rose from 43 at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 to 115 in the Hundred Rolls of 1279. The number of households was 68 in 1563 and 65 in 1662, but rose sharply to 98 in 1666. In 1707 there were 120 families and in the 1801 Census there were 121, and this first census counted a total population of 493 people. The population grew for the next half-century, peaking at 813 in the 1851 Census.

Ickleton depended almost entirely on farming and in 1707 many of the families had been poor. Both conditions still applied 150 years later, so many of Ickleton&#x27;s young men emigrated. Robert Herbert, who inherited the Manor of Ickleton in 1855 and joined the colonial service, encouraged many of them to settle in Queensland, Australia. Herbert was Premier of Queensland 1859–66 and a civil servant at the Colonial Office in London 1866–92.

After 1851 Ickleton&#x27;s population fell for seven decades, until after the First World War the 1921 Census recorded a low of 543 people. Thereafter the number slowly increased again, but then reached a new low of 526 in the 1971 Census. Since then it has increased substantially, possibly encouraged by the arrival of the M11 motorway in 1979 and the electrification of the railway to in 1987 (see &quot;Transport&quot;, below). The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 709.

===Mills===
The Domesday Book records that in 1086 the parish had two watermills, presumably on the River Cam. One was at Ickleton itself, and the other was at Brookhampton just north of the village. By 1432 the road now called Mill Lane was called the fulling-mill street. The mill at the village had gone by 1545, but in 1818 a new watermill was built on the south side of the village. In 1927 the last miller was killed in the water-wheel and the mill was closed.

By 1432 one of the hills of the parish was called Windmill Hill, suggesting that the parish had a windmill by then. By 1545 the windmill was on or close to its present site, about northwest of the village, west of Duxford Road. Early in the 19th century it was replaced with a brick-built tower mill. The mill closed soon after 1900, and by 1925 it had been converted into a house.

===Historic houses===

The village prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries. A number of buildings survive from that time: Mowbrays in Church Street has already been noted (see &quot;Lesser estates&quot;, above). Padcot in Abbey Street is another Grade II* listed building dating from about 1500. It is a timber-framed building, originally one house and later divided into two cottages. It was built as a hall house, but early in the 17th century a floor was inserted in part of the house. The house has a cross wing with a crown post roof.

===Public houses===

Ickleton has had a number of public houses. In 1592 there was the Bell, and in the same century there was an inn that may have been called the Rose. In the 17th century there was the White Lion, which was in Church Street south of the village green and burnt down before 1699. The Chequer was built in the same site and was recorded in 1778. By 1847 it was called the Duke of Wellington. In about 1957 it ceased trading and it is now a private house. It is a timber-framed building from the end of the 17th century with 19th-century additions.

By 1728 there was a pub in Abbey Street called the Lion. This may be the same as the Red Lion recorded in 1800, which is a timber-framed building dating from about 1700 with 18th and 19th century alterations. It is currently called the Ickleton Lion and is controlled by Greene King Brewery.

There was a New Inn in Brookhampton Street that was trading in 1884. and The Greyhound in the south of the parish on the edge of Great Chesterford was open by 1851 and still trading in 1972. It closed before the end of the 20th century.

As well as the Ickleton Lion, the village has a social club.

===Schools===

There are records from 1601 and 1625 that Ickleton had a schoolmaster, and from 1638 and 1678 that part of the church was used as the schoolroom. However, the school later lapsed and it was not until 1804 that the vicar started a Sunday school. There was a day school in the parish by 1825 and two by 1833, which seem to have been dame schools.

In 1846 a British School was opened in the Congregational chapel&#x27;s schoolroom. It had 70 pupils an 1870, was still open in 1888 but there is no later record of it.

The vicar started a Church of England day school in about 1848 in a room in Mill Lane. A purpose-built school and schoolmaster&#x27;s house for the school in Church Street were completed in 1871 and enlarged in 1884. The number of pupils increased from 57 in 1872 to 103 in 1888. The school closed in 1961, was bought by the village and converted into the village hall.

===Transport===
In 1845 the Eastern Counties Railway opened its extension from (Essex) down the Cam Valley to , and beyond. The line crosses the river at Ickleton and skirts the eastern edge of the parish. The nearest station is across the river at , about southeast of Ickleton village. British Rail electrified the line in 1987. It is now the West Anglia Main Line.

In 1979 the M11 Motorway was extended from Stansted in Essex to Stump Cross, about east of Ickleton on the Essex–Cambridgeshire boundary. In 1980 the motorway was extended again, from Junction 9 to Cambridge, passing through Ickleton parish only about west of the village.

==Current amenities==

As well as the Ickleton Lion and Ickleton Social Club, the village has a combined village shop and post office and a few small businesses providing employment in the village, notably Team Consulting, a medical device design &amp; development consultancy, based at the Abbey Barns business campus.

<text>The Cantino planisphere or Cantino world map is a manuscript Portuguese world map preserved at the Biblioteca Estense in Modena, Italy. It is named after Alberto Cantino, an agent for the Duke of Ferrara, who successfully smuggled it from Portugal to Italy in 1502. It measures 220 x 105 cm.

The planisphere is the earliest surviving map showing Portuguese geographic discoveries in the east and west and is particularly notable for portraying a fragmentary record of the Brazilian coast, which the Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral explored in 1500, the southern coast of Greenland, explored in the late 1490s, and the African coast of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with remarkable accuracy and detail.

It was valuable at the beginning of the sixteenth century because it showed detailed and up-to-date strategic information in a time when geographic knowledge of the world was growing at a fast pace. It is important in the modern era because it contains unique historical information about the maritime exploration and the evolution of nautical cartography during the Age of Discovery. The Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant nautical chart that depicts places in Africa and parts of Brazil and India according to their actual latitudes.

== History ==

At the beginning of the 16th century, Lisbon was a buzzing metropolis where people from diverse backgrounds came in search of work, glory or fortune. There were also many undercover agents looking for the secrets brought by the Portuguese voyages to remote lands. Among them was Alberto Cantino, who was sent to Portugal by Ercole I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, with the formal intention of horse trading, while secretly collecting information on Portuguese discoveries.

A popular theory, introduced in the earliest studies of the map, suggests that the Cantino Planisphere was ordered to an official Portuguese mapmaker, who made a copy of the royal cartographic pattern, the so-called &quot;Padrão Real&quot;, kept in the &quot;Armazéns da Índia&quot;. However, there is no historical evidence that such order was ever made and the theory is weakened by the presence of numerous mistakes. One would expect a carefully made copy of an official standard, if it existed in Portugal at that time, would be accurate. A more plausible explanation is that the map was surreptitiously acquired shortly after it was made for some nobleman or official client. From a letter sent by Cantino to his patron, the Duke of Ferrara, on 19 November 1502, we know that he paid 12 golden ducats for it, which was a considerable amount for the time. An Italian inscription in the back of the map reads: &quot;Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam trovate in le parte de India: dono Alberto Cantino al S. Duca Hercole&quot;, which translates as &quot;Navigational chart of the islands recently [discovered]... in part of the Indies: from Alberto Cantino to Duke Hercole&quot;.
While it enlightened the Italians to many new territories yet unknown to them, it was made obsolete within months by subsequent Portuguese mapping voyages. Nevertheless, its importance to the Portuguese–Italian trade relations should not be understated; this map provided the Italians with knowledge of Brazil&#x27;s coastline and that of much of the Atlantic Coast of South America long before other nations even knew South America extended so far to the south. It also supplied great details of the Indian Ocean.

The geographical information given on the Cantino map was copied into the Italian-made Canerio (or Caveri) map shortly after the Cantino map arrived in Italy and the Canerio, in turn, became the primary source for the design of the newly discovered western lands on the highly influential wall map of the world produced by Martin Waldseemüller in 1507 under the auspices of Rene, Duke of Lorraine.

This old map, made of six glued parchment sheets, was kept in the Ducal Library, Ferrara, for about 90 years, until Pope Clement VIII transferred it to another palace in Modena, Italy. More than two centuries later, in 1859, the palace was ransacked and the Cantino Map lost. It was found by Giuseppe Boni, Director of the Biblioteca Estense, in that same year, in a butcher&#x27;s store in Modena. The Cantino world map can currently be found in Modena, Italy, at the Biblioteca Estense.

== Construction ==

The Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant example of the so-called &quot;latitude chart&quot;, which was developed following the introduction of astronomical navigation, during the second half of the fifteenth century. Contrary to the portolan charts of the Mediterranean, which were constructed on the basis of magnetic courses and estimated distances between places, in the latitude chart, places were represented according to their latitudes. In the Cantino planisphere, latitudes were incorporated only in the coasts of Africa, Brazil and India, while Europe and the Caribbean Sea continued to be represented according to the portolan-chart model ).

The construction of the rhumb line system in the Cantino planisphere uses two circles (some charts use only one, others use as many as three, depending on size): the western circle is centered on the Cape Vert islands, the eastern circle is centered in India. The circumference of each circle is marked with sixteen equally spaced points, from which radiate the 32 classic rhumbs: 0°, 11 1/4°, 22 1/2°, 33 3/4°, etc. The western and eastern outer circles are tangent to each other at a large wind-rose in central Africa, with a fleur-de-lis indicating North. This dense rhumb-line mesh was used in navigation as a reference, for reading and marking directions (courses) between places. Six scale bars graduated in Iberian leagues, with a variable number of sections (or &quot;logs&quot;), are distributed over the chart&#x27;s area. These were used to measure distances between places.

Illustrations are few, but elaborate. Two cities are grandly depicted - Venice and Jerusalem. There is also an elaborate depiction of the Portuguese castle of São Jorge da Mina (Elmina Castle, on the Gold Coast of west Africa), flanked by two African towns. Other illustrations include a lion-shaped mountain representing the Sierra Leone mountain range, the Tower of Babel (laid horizontal), the mythical Mountains of the Moon (legendary source of the Nile River) in central Africa, and either the Table Mountain or Drakensberg range in South Africa. Along the central African coast are the various cross stone markers (&quot;padrões&quot;) erected by Diogo Cão and Bartolomeu Dias in the 1480s.

In north Africa, there is the &quot;Montes Claros&quot; in the usual place of the Atlas Mountains, the legend below on the left reading that &quot;this is the land of King Organo, whose king is very noble and very rich&quot;, and to the right that this is the &quot;land of the King of Nubia, the king of which is continuously making war on Prester John and is a moor and a great enemy of Christians&quot;.

== Discoveries ==
=== North America ===

By the time of the map&#x27;s creation, European voyages had made landfall across the Atlantic Ocean. Christopher Columbus had completed his first three voyages to a land that he called both Cuba and Asia. John Cabot had completed three voyages from Bristol under Henry VII of England. Very little was known about Cabot&#x27;s third voyage, including whether Cabot ever returned to England. While sailing to Greenland, known but little understood by contemporary Europeans, João Fernandes Lavrador made landfall on a nearby coast. Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel, members of the Portuguese royal household, sailed West under Manuel I of Portugal to find a Northwest Passage to Asia. Newfoundland, visited in 1500 and 1501 by the Corte-Real brothers, is labeled as &quot;Terra del Rey de Portuguall&quot; on the Cantino map.

The map features a peculiar landmass in roughly the location of North America. Several theories offer potential explanations for this land that terminates in a peninsula, labeled &quot;C. do fim do abrill&quot; or &quot;‘Cape of the end of April&quot;, pointing towards the Caribbean. It has been linked to Asia, the Yucatan, Florida, and Cuba. The area includes few defined cartographic details and names seemingly connected to the voyages of Columbus, Cabot, and Corte Real. Other maps depicting the same land include the Caverio map, the maps of Martin Waldseemüller, and the Johannes Schöner globes. These describe the land variously as &quot;Terra ultra incognita&quot; (&quot;Land beyond unknown&quot;), &quot;Vlterius incognita terra&quot; (&quot;Land further beyond unknown&quot;), &quot;Terra de Cvba&quot; (&quot;Land of Cuba&quot;), &quot;Parias&quot; (a native place name from &quot;Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci&quot;), and &quot;Asie partis&quot; (&quot;Part of Asia&quot;).

=== South America ===
The Brazilian coast was certainly the last to be added and reached its present form in three phases: to the first belong an initial coastline running to southeast from &quot;Golfo fremosso&quot; to &quot;Cabo Sam Jorge&quot;, and from there, to north of &quot;Porto Seguro&quot;, continuing further south to the tip of the landmass. An inscription off Porto Seguro records the discovery and naming of Vera Cruz, as Brazil was initially called:

Porto Seguro. Vera Cruz, so called by this name, was found by Pedro Alvares Cabral, a gentleman of the household of the King of Portugal, which he discovered in going as commander of fourteen ships that the King sent to Calicut and, on the way to India, he came across this land here, which he thought to be mainland [terra firma], in which there are many people who are observed, men and women, to walk about as naked as their mothers bore them: they are rather fair-skinned than reddish brown and have very slick hair. This land was discovered in 1500.

Only a relatively small portion of the coast, between the flag near the &quot;Vera cruz&quot; inscription and the northern side of the &quot;baia de todos os santos&quot; would have been surveyed, in 1500, by the fleet of Pedro Álvares Cabral. To the second phase belongs the pasting of the strip of parchment between &quot;Rio de sã franc°&quot; and &quot;Golfo fremosso&quot;, which would have been based on the information brought by the fleet of João da Nova, who arrived in Lisbon in September 1502. In the third phase the island named &quot;quaresma&quot;, together with some names written in cursive would have been added.

=== Greenland ===
The European rediscovery of Greenland is thought to have been by João Fernandes Labrador and Pedro de Barcelos between 1495 and 1498, and also visited by Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot), in the English expedition of 1498. But the depiction of the island on the map suggests it was based on the Portuguese mission of Labrador and Barcelos. Newfoundland was probably visited by an English expedition in 1497–98, and again, by the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real in 1500 and 1501. The map makes clear that the land was discovered and charted for Portugal by Gaspar Corte-Real, for King Manuel I of Portugal.

<text>Messier 47 (M47 or NGC 2422), also known as NGC 2478 is an open cluster in the mildly southern constellation of Puppis. It was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and in his then keynote work re-discovered by Charles Messier on 1771. It was also independently discovered by Caroline Herschel.

There is no cluster in the position indicated by Messier, which he expressed in terms of its right ascension and declination with respect to the star 2 Puppis. However, if the signs (+ and −) he wrote are swapped, the position matches. Until this equivalency was found, M47 was considered a lost Messier Object. This identification as the same thing (ad idem) only came in 1959 with a realization by Canadian astronomer T. F. Morris.

M47 is centered about 1,600 light-years away and is about 78 million years old. The member stars have been measured down to about red dwarfs at apparent magnitude 19. There are around 500 members, the brightest being HD 60855, a magnitude 5.7 Be star. The cluster is dominated by hot class B main sequence and giant stars, but a noticeable colour contrast comes from its brightest red giants.

It about a degree from Messier 46, which is much older and much further away.

<text>The Communist League of Great Britain was an anti-revisionist group in the United Kingdom.

It origins were in the Communist Party of Great Britain, where a faction formed around Bill Bland. Initially Maoist, it joined the majority of the Committee to Defeat Revisionism, for Communist Unity in 1965 to form the Action Centre for Marxist-Leninist Unity, publishing &quot;Hammer or Anvil&quot;. In 1967, this was renamed the Marxist–Leninist Organisation of Britain. Soon after, the group ceased supporting Mao, instead supporting Hoxhaism - although Enver Hoxha was aligned with Mao at the time. Following a split the MLOB was renamed the &quot;Communist League&quot; in 1975, its ideological position strengthened with the Sino-Albanian split.

The group remained active into the new millennium, but became less so since Bland&#x27;s death in 2001, and their website contains no new content since that year. The &quot;Communist Party Alliance&quot;, a successor group working within the Stalin Society, had their own site which was active until 2009.

<doc id="963201" wikidata="Q152289" url="?curid=963201" title="Hemispatial neglect">
<text>Hemispatial neglect is a neuropsychological condition in which, after damage to one hemisphere of the brain (e.g. after a stroke), a deficit in attention and awareness towards the side of space opposite brain damage (contralesional space) is observed. It is defined by the inability of a person to process and perceive stimuli towards the contralesional side of the body or environment. Hemispatial neglect is very commonly contralateral to the damaged hemisphere, but instances of ipsilesional neglect (on the same side as the lesion) have been reported.

==Presentation==
Hemispatial neglect results most commonly from strokes and brain unilateral injury to the right cerebral hemisphere, with rates in the critical stage of up to 80% causing visual neglect of the left-hand side of space. Neglect is often produced by massive strokes in the middle cerebral artery region and is variegated, so that most sufferers do not exhibit all of the syndrome&#x27;s traits. Right-sided spatial neglect is rare because there is redundant processing of the right space by both the left and right cerebral hemispheres, whereas in most left-dominant brains the left space is only processed by the right cerebral hemisphere. Although it most strikingly affects visual perception (&#x27;visual neglect&#x27;), neglect in other forms of perception can also be found, either alone or in combination with visual neglect.

For example, a stroke affecting the right parietal lobe of the brain can lead to neglect for the left side of the visual field, causing a patient with neglect to behave as if the left side of sensory space is nonexistent (although they can still turn left). In an extreme case, a patient with neglect might fail to eat the food on the left half of their plate, even though they complain of being hungry. If someone with neglect is asked to draw a clock, their drawing might show only the numbers 12 to 6, or all 12 numbers might be on one half of the clock face with the other half distorted or blank. Neglect patients may also ignore the contralesional side of their body; for instance, they might only shave, or apply make-up to, the non-neglected side. These patients may frequently collide with objects or structures such as door frames on the side being neglected.

Neglect may also present as a delusional form, where the patient denies ownership of a limb or an entire side of the body. Since this delusion often occurs alone, without the accompaniment of other delusions, it is often labeled as a monothematic delusion.

Neglect not only affects present sensation but memory and recall perception as well. A patient suffering from neglect may also, when asked to recall a memory of a certain object and then draw said object, draw only half of the object. It is unclear, however, if this is due to a perceptive deficit of the memory (to the patient having lost pieces of spatial information of the memory) or whether the information within the memory is whole and intact but simply being ignored, the same way portions of a physical object in the patient&#x27;s presence would be ignored.

Some forms of neglect may also be very mild—for example, in a condition called extinction where competition from the ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception of the contralesional stimulus. These patients, when asked to fixate on the examiner&#x27;s nose, can detect fingers being wiggled on the affected side. If the examiner&#x27;s fingers were wiggled on both the affected and unaffected sides of the patient, the patient will report seeing movement only on the ipsilesional side.

===Effects===

Though it is frequently underappreciated, unilateral neglect can have dramatic consequences. It has more negative effect on functional ability, as measured by the Barthel ADL index, than age, sex, power, side of stroke, balance, proprioception, cognition, and premorbid ADL status. Its presence within the first 10 days of a stroke is a stronger predictor of poor functional recovery after one year than several other variables, including hemiparesis, hemianopsia, age, visual memory, verbal memory, and visuoconstructional ability. Neglect is probably among the reasons patients with right hemisphere damage are twice as likely to fall as those with left-side brain damage. Patients with neglect take longer to rehabilitate and make less daily progress than other patients with similar functional status. Patients with neglect are also less likely to live independently than patients who have both severe aphasia and right hemiparesis.

==Causes==
Brain areas in the parietal and frontal lobes are associated with the deployment of attention (internally, or through eye movements, head turns or limb reaches) into contralateral space. Neglect is most closely related to damage to the temporo-parietal junction and posterior parietal cortex. The lack of attention to the left side of space can manifest in the visual, auditory, proprioceptive, and olfactory domains. Although hemispatial neglect often manifests as a sensory deficit (and is frequently co-morbid with sensory deficit), it is essentially a failure to pay sufficient attention to sensory input.

Although hemispatial neglect has been identified following left hemisphere damage (resulting in the neglect of the right side of space), it is most common after damage to the right hemisphere. This disparity is thought to reflect the fact that the right hemisphere of the brain is specialized for spatial perception and memory, whereas the left hemisphere is specialized for language - there is redundant processing of the right visual fields by both hemispheres. Hence the right hemisphere is able to compensate for the loss of left hemisphere function, but not vice versa.
Neglect is not to be confused with hemianopsia. Hemianopsia arises from damage to the primary visual pathways cutting off the input to the cerebral hemispheres from the retinas. Neglect is damage to the processing areas. The cerebral hemispheres receive the input, but there is an error in the processing that is not yet well understood.

==Theories of mechanism==
Researchers have debated about whether neglect is a disorder of spatial attention or spatial representation, or even non-spatial deficits of attention combined with a directional bias that results from unilateral brain injury.

===Spatial attention===
Spatial attention is the process where objects in one location are chosen for processing over objects in another location. This would imply that neglect is more intentional. The patient has an affinity to direct attention to the unaffected side. Neglect is caused by a decrease in stimuli in the contralesional side because of a lack of ipsilesional stimulation of the visual cortex and an increased inhibition of the contralesional side.

In this theory, neglect is seen as disorder of attention and orientation caused by disruption of the visual cortex. Patients with this disorder will direct attention and movements to the ipsilesional side and neglect stimuli in the contralesional side despite having preserved visual fields. The result of all of this is an increased sensitivity of visual performance in the unaffected side. The patient shows an affinity to the ipsilesional side being unable to disengage attention from that side.

===Spatial representation===
Spatial representation is the way space is represented in the brain. In this theory, it is believed that the underlying cause of neglect is the inability to form contralateral representations of space. In this theory, neglect patients demonstrate a failure to describe the contralesional side of a familiar scene, from a given point, from memory.

To support this theory, evidence from Bisiach and Luzzatti&#x27;s study of Piazza del Duomo can be considered. For the study, patients with hemispatial neglect, that were also familiar with the layout of the Piazza del Duomo square, were observed. The patients were asked to imagine themselves at various vantage points in the square, without physically being in the square. They were then asked to describe different landmarks around the square, such as stores. At each separate vantage point, patients consistently only described landmarks on the right side, ignoring the left side of the representation. However, the results of their multiple descriptions at the different vantage points showed that they knew information around the entire square, but could only identify the right side of the represented field at any given vantage point. When asked to switch vantage points so that the scene that was on the contralesional side is now on the ipsilesional side the patient was able to describe with details the scene they had earlier neglected.

The same patterns can be found with comparing actual visual stimuli to imaging in the brain (Rossetti et al., 2010). A neglect patient who was very familiar with the map of France was asked to name French towns on a map of the country, both by a mental image of the map and by a physical image of the map. The image was then rotated 180 degrees, both mentally and physically. With the mental image, the neglect stayed consistent with the image; that is, when the map was in its original orientation, the patient named towns mostly on the East side of France, and when they mentally rotated the map they named towns mostly on the West side of France because the West coast was now on the right side of the represented field. However, with the physical copy of the map, the patient&#x27;s focus was on the East side of France with either orientation. This leads researchers to believe that neglect for images in memory may be disassociated from the neglect of stimuli in extrapersonal space. In this case patients have no loss of memory making their neglect a disorder of spatial representation which is the ability to reconstruct spatial frames in which the spatial relationship of objects, that may be perceived, imagined or remembered, with respect to the subject and each other are organized to be correctly acted on.

This theory can also be supported by neglect in dreams (Figliozzi et al., 2007). The study was run on a neglect patient by tracking his eye movements while he slept, during the REM cycle. Results showed that the majority of the eye movements were aimed to his right side, indicating that the images represented in his dreams were also affected by hemispatial neglect.

Another example would be a left neglect patient failing to describe left turns while describing a familiar route. This shows that the failure to describe things in the contralesional side can also affect verbal items. These findings show that space representation is more topological than symbolic. Patients show a contralesional loss of space representation with a deviation of spatial reference to the ipsilesional side. In these cases we see a left-right dissimilarity of representation rather than a decline of representational competence.

==Diagnosis==
===Neglect test===
Some of the neglect tests.

In order to assess not only the type but also the severity of neglect, doctors employ a variety of tests, most of which are carried out at the patient&#x27;s bedside. Perhaps one of the most-used and quickest is the line bisection. In this test, a line a few inches long is drawn on a piece of paper and the patient is then asked to dissect the line at the midpoint. Patients exhibiting, for example, left-sided neglect will exhibit a rightward deviation of the line&#x27;s true midpoint.

Another widely used test is the line cancellation test. Here, a patient is presented with a piece of paper that has various lines scattered across it and is asked to mark each of the lines. Patients who exhibit left-sided neglect will completely ignore all lines on the left side of the paper.

Visual neglect can also be assessed by having the patient draw a copy of a picture with which they are presented. If the patient is asked to draw a complex picture they may neglect the entire contralesional side of the picture. If asked to draw an individual object, the patient will not draw the contralesional side of that object.

A patient may also be asked to read a page out of a book. The patient will be unable to orient their eyes to the left margin and will begin reading the page from the center. Presenting a single word to a patient will result in the patient either reading only the ipsilesional part of the word or replacing the part they cannot see with a logical substitute. For example, if they are presented with the word &quot;peanut&quot;, they may read &quot;nut&quot; or say &quot;walnut&quot;.

===Varieties===

Neglect is a heterogenous disorder that manifests itself radically differently in different patients. No single mechanism can account for these different manifestations. A vast array of impaired mechanisms are found in neglect. These mechanisms alone would not cause neglect. The complexity of attention alone—just one of several mechanisms that may interact—has generated multiple competing hypothetical explanations of neglect. So it is not surprising that it has proven difficult to assign particular presentations of neglect to specific neuroanatomical loci. Despite such limitations, we may loosely describe unilateral neglect with four overlapping variables: type, range, axis, and orientation.

====Type====
Types of hemispatial neglect are broadly divided into disorders of input and disorders of output. The neglect of input, or &quot;inattention&quot;, includes ignoring contralesional sights, sounds, smells, or tactile stimuli. Surprisingly, this inattention can even apply to imagined stimuli. In what&#x27;s termed &quot;representational neglect&quot;, patients may ignore the left side of memories, dreams, and hallucinations.

Output neglect includes motor and pre-motor deficits. A patient with motor neglect does not use a contralesional limb despite the neuromuscular ability to do so. One with pre-motor neglect, or directional hypokinesia, can move unaffected limbs ably in ipsilateral space but have difficulty directing them into contralesional space. Thus a patient with pre-motor neglect may struggle to grasp an object on the left side even when using the unaffected right arm.

====Range====

Hemispatial neglect can have a wide range in terms of what the patient neglects. The first range of neglect, commonly referred to as &quot;egocentric&quot; neglect, is found in patients who neglect their own body or personal space. These patients tend to neglect the opposite side of their lesion, based on the midline of the body, head, or retina. For example, in a gap detection test, subjects with egocentric hemispatial neglect on the right side often make errors on the far right side of the page, as they are neglecting the space in their right visual field.

The next range of neglect is &quot;allocentric&quot; neglect, where individuals neglect either their peri-personal or extrapersonal space. Peri-personal space refers to the space within the patient&#x27;s normal reach, whereas extrapersonal space refers to the objects/environment beyond the body&#x27;s current contact or reaching ability. Patients with allocentric neglect tend to neglect the contralesional side of individual items, regardless of where they appear with respect to the viewer. For example, In the same gap detection test mentioned above, subjects with allocentric hemispatial neglect on the right side will make errors on all areas of the page, specifically neglecting the right side of each individual item.

This differentiation is significant because the majority of assessment measures test only for neglect within the reaching, or peri-personal, range. But a patient who passes a standard paper-and-pencil test of neglect may nonetheless ignore a left arm or not notice distant objects on the left side of the room.

In cases of somatoparaphrenia, which may be caused by personal neglect, patients deny ownership of contralesional limbs. Sacks (1985) described a patient who fell out of bed after pushing out what he perceived to be the severed leg of a cadaver that the staff had hidden under his blanket. Patients may say things like, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whose hand that is, but they&#x27;d better get my ring off!&quot; or, &quot;This is a fake arm someone put on me. I sent my daughter to find my real one.&quot;

====Axis====
Most tests for neglect look for rightward or leftward errors. But patients may also neglect stimuli on one side of a horizontal or radial axis. For example, when asked to circle all the stars on a printed page, they may locate targets on both the left and right sides of the page while ignoring those across the top or bottom.

In a recent study, researchers asked patients with left neglect to project their midline with a neon bulb and found that they tended to point it straight ahead but position it rightward of their true midline. This shift may account for the success of therapeutic prism glasses, which shift left visual space toward the right. By shifting visual input, they seem to correct the mind&#x27;s sense of midline. The result is not only the amelioration of visual neglect, but also of tactile, motor, and even representational neglect.

====Orientation====
An important question in studies of neglect has been: &quot;left of what?&quot; That is to say, what frame of reference does a subject adopt when neglecting the left half of his or her visual, auditory, or tactile field? The answer has proven complex. It turns out that subjects may neglect objects to the left of their own midline (egocentric neglect) or may instead see all the objects in a room but neglect the left half of each individual object (allocentric neglect).

These two broad categories may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind&#x27;s eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as being on the left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right side up and then neglect the left side of the adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a barbell, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the barbell, as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the object, even though it is now on the right side of space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of the World may neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map.

Various neuropsychological research studies have considered the role of frame of reference in hemispatial neglect, offering new evidence to support both allocentric and egocentric neglect. To begin, one study conducted by Dongyun Li, Hans-Otto Karnath, and Christopher Rorden examined whether allocentric neglect varies with egocentric position. This experimental design consisted of testing eleven right hemispheric stroke patients. Five of these patients showed spatial neglect on their contralesional side, while the remaining six patients showed no spatial neglect. During the study, the patients were presented with two arrays of seven triangles. The first array ran from southwest to northeast (SW-NE) and the second array ran from southeast to northwest (SE-NW). In a portion of the experimental trials, the middle triangle in the array contained a gap along one side. Participants were tested on their ability to perceive the presence of this gap, and were instructed to press one response button if the gap was present and a second response button if the gap was absent.

To test the neglect frame of reference, the two different arrays were carefully situated so that gap in the triangle fell on opposite sides of the allocentric field. In the SW-NE array, the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric right of the object-centered axis along which the triangle pointed. In the SE-NW configuration, the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric left of the object-centered axis. Furthermore, varying the position of the arrays with respect to the participant&#x27;s trunk midline was used to test egocentric neglect. The arrays were therefore presented at 0° (i.e. in line with the participant&#x27;s trunk midline), at −40° left, and at +40° right. Ultimately, varying the position of the array within the testing visual field allowed for the simultaneous measurement of egocentric neglect and allocentric neglect. The results of this experimental design showed that the spatial neglect patients performed more poorly for the allocentric left side of the triangle, as well as for objects presented on the egocentric left side of the body. Furthermore, the poor accuracy for detecting features of the object on the left side of the object&#x27;s axis was more severe when the objects were presented on the contralesional side of the body. Thus, these findings illustrate that both allocentric and egocentric biases are present simultaneously, and that egocentric information can influence the severity of allocentric neglect.

A second study, conducted by Moscovitch and Behrmann, investigated the reference frame of neglect with respect to the somatosensory system. Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment. A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized, during which the patients were touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist of one hand. The patients were tested both with their palms facing down and with their palms facing up. This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the somatosensory system occurs with respect to the sensory receptor surface (egocentric) or with respect to a higher-order spatial frame of reference (allocentric). The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space, regardless of hand orientation. These findings suggest that, within the somatosensory system, stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric, spatial frame of reference, in addition to an egocentric, sensory frame of reference. Ultimately, the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple, simultaneously derived frames of reference, which dictate the nature and extent of neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile fields.

==Treatment==
Treatment consists of finding ways to bring the patient&#x27;s attention toward the left, usually done incrementally, by going just a few degrees past midline, and progressing from there. Rehabilitation of neglect is often carried out by neuropsychologists, occupational therapists,
speech-language pathologists, neurologic music therapists, physical therapists, optometrists, and orthoptists.

Forms of treatment that have been tested with variable reports of success include prismatic adaptation, where a prism lens is worn to pull the vision of the patient towards the left, constrained movement therapy where the &quot;good&quot; limb is constrained in a sling to encourage use of the contralesional limb. Eye-patching has similarly been used, placing a patch over the &quot;good&quot; eye. Pharmaceutical treatments have mostly focused on dopaminergic therapies such as bromocriptine, levodopa, and amphetamines, though these tests have had mixed results, helping in some cases and accentuating hemispatial neglect in others. Caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) has been shown to bring about a brief remission in some cases. however this technique has been known to elicit unpleasant side-effects such as nystagmus, vertigo and vomiting.
A study done by Schindler and colleagues examined the use of neck muscle vibration on the contralesional posterior neck muscles to induce diversion of gaze from the subjective straight ahead. Subjects received 15 consecutive treatment sessions and were evaluated on different aspects of the neglect disorder including perception of midline, and scanning deficits. The study found that there is evidence that neck muscle stimulation may work, especially if combined with visual scanning techniques. The improvement was evident 2 months after the completion of treatment.

Other areas of emerging treatment options include the use of prisms, visual scanning training, mental imagery training, video feedback training, trunk rotation, galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). Of these emerging treatment options, the most studied intervention is prism adaptation and there is evidence of relatively long-term functional gains from comparatively short-term usage. However, all of these treatment interventions (particularly the stimulation techniques) are relatively new and randomised, controlled trial evidence is still limited. Further research is mandatory in this field of research in order to provide more support in evidence-based practice.

In a review article by Pierce &amp; Buxbaum (2002), they concluded that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches, which focuses on moving the limb on the side of the neglect, has conflicting evidence in the literature. The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb, which may not be possible for many patients. Constraint-Induced Therapy (CIT), appears to be an effective, long-term treatment for improving neglect in various studies. However, the use of CIT is limited to patients who have active control of wrist and hand extension. Prism Glasses, Hemispatial Glasses, and Eye-Patching have all appeared to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests. Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect; however, the effects are generally short-term. The review also suggests that Optokinetic Stimulation is effective in improving position sense, motor skills, body orientation, and perceptual neglect on a short-term basis. As with Caloric Stimulation treatment, long-term studies will be necessary to show its effectiveness. A few Trunk Rotation Therapy studies suggest its effectiveness in improving performance on neglect tests as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Some less studied treatment possibilities include treatments that target Dorsal Stream of visual processing, Mental Imagery Training, and Neck Vibration Therapy. Trunk rotation therapies aimed at improving postural disorders and balance deficits in patients with unilateral neglect, have demonstrated optimistic results in regaining voluntary trunk control when using specific postural rehabilitative devices. One such device is the Bon Saint Côme apparatus, which uses spatial exploratory tasks in combination with auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to develop trunk control. The Bon Saint Côme device has been shown to be effective with hemiplegic subjects due to the combination of trunk stability exercises, along with the cognitive requirements needed to perform the postural tasks.

<text>Messier 48 or M48, also known as NGC 2548, is an open cluster of stars in the equatorial constellation of Hydra. It sits near Hydra&#x27;s westernmost limit with Monoceros, about to the east and slightly south of Hydra&#x27;s brightest star, Alphard. This grouping was discovered by Charles Messier in 1771, but there is no cluster precisely where Messier indicated; he made an error, as he did with M47. The value that he gave for the right ascension matches, however, his declination is off by five degrees. Credit for discovery is sometimes given instead to Caroline Herschel in 1783. Her nephew John Herschel described it as, &quot;a superb cluster which fills the whole field; stars of 9th and 10th to the 13th magnitude – and none below, but the whole ground of the sky on which it stands is singularly dotted over with infinitely minute points&quot;.

M48 is visible to the naked eye under good atmospheric conditions. The brightest member is the star HIP 40348 at visual magnitude 8.3. The cluster is located some from the Sun. The age estimated from isochrones is  Myr, while gyrochronology age estimate is  Myr – in good agreement. This makes it intermediate in age between the Pleiades, at around 100 Myr, and the Hyades, at about 650 Myr. The metallicity of the cluster, based on the abundance of iron (Fe), is [Fe/H] = , where −1 would be ten times lower than in the Sun. It is more metal-poor than the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe clusters.

The cluster has a tidal radius of with at least 438 members and a mass of . The general structure of the cluster is fragmented and lumpy, which may be due to interactions with the galactic disk. The cluster is now subdivided into three groups, each of which has its own collective proper motion.

<doc id="963217" wikidata="Q147030" url="?curid=963217" title="Nymphaea alba">
<text>Nymphaea alba, the white waterlily, European white water lily or white nenuphar , is an aquatic flowering plant in the family Nymphaeaceae. It is native to North Africa, temperate Asia, Europe and tropical Asia (Jammu and Kashmir).

Since &quot;Nymphaceae alba&quot; is an aquatic plant, its specialized trichomes are hydropotes, formed at an abaxial surface of the young leaf and packed tightly in the rosette at the rhizome&#x27;s flattened apex. The rhizomes contain high amounts of carbohydrate and protein.

==Description==
&quot;Nymphaea alba&quot; has a white flower that usually blooms during the daytime in most summer. The flower blooms on top of a big rounded green leaf up to 30 cm: both leaves float on the water&#x27;s surface. At first, the flower bloom is cup-shaped, with a size of around 8 cm, then it rises to 20 cm and becomes star-shaped over time. The flower&#x27;s petals are arranged in a row, pointing up surrounding several yellow stamens. The leaves can be up to in diameter and take up a spread of per plant.

==Cytology==
The chromosome count is n = 42. The genome size is 1950 Mb.

==Taxonomy==
It was first published and described by Carl Linnaeus in his book &#x27;Species Plantarum&#x27;, on page 510 in 1753.

The red variety (&quot;Nymphaea alba&quot; f. &quot;rosea&quot;) is cultivated from lake Fagertärn (&quot;Fair tarn&quot;) in the forest of Tiveden, Sweden, where it was discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery led to large-scale exploitation which nearly made it extinct in the wild before it was protected.

&quot;Nymphaea candida&quot; is sometimes considered a subspecies of &quot;N. alba&quot; (&quot;N. alba&quot; L. subsp. &quot;candida&quot; ).

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Nymphaea alba&quot; is native all over Europe and in parts of North Africa and the Middle East in fresh water. In Africa, it is found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In temperate Asia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Palestine and Turkey. It is found in tropical Asia, within the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Lastly, within Europe, it is found in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, France, Portugal and Spain. It has been introduced to the Azores, Bangladesh, Chile, parts of China, Myanmar, and New Zealand.

&quot;Nymphaceae alba&quot; grows in ponds, ditches, lakes, or canals because these places have still and very slow-moving water. For example, lakes and ponds were created by gravel extraction as fishponds or for livestock, and lakes are just temporary features filled with sediment under and developing fen vegetation. Moreover, canals and ditches are more common than ponds since these are artificial water bodies created for transport or recreation; these places can support wildlife, such as attracting other species of insects or providing a shelter for frogs and early nectar insects.

==Phytochemistry==
It contains the active alkaloids nupharine and nymphaeine, and is a sedative and an aphrodisiac/anaphrodisiac depending on sources. Although roots and stalks are used in traditional herbal medicine along with the flower, the petals and other flower parts are the most potent. Alcohol can be used to extract the active alkaloids, and it also boosts the sedative effects. The root of the plant was used by monks and nuns for hundreds of years as an anaphrodisiac, being crushed and mixed with wine. In the earliest printed medical textbooks, authors maintained this use, though warning against consuming large and frequent doses.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Nymphaea alba&quot; needs plenty of space since it grows up to 4 in tall and 3 to 5 ft wide. This plant performs best under full sun in loamy soil and undisturbed water. The basket covers the plant with a pea shingle placed under the water&#x27;s surface around 6 to 10 inches, and the lower part of the plant can be twice the initial planting depth when the plant is formed. This plant can be fed during the growing season by proprietary aquatic fertilizer.

Water Lilly is valuable and nutritious when people can use the peduncle and young leaf for vegetables, and rhizomes can be used as food supplements; moreover, local people can use different parts of the plant for various purposes, such as making herbal medicine to treat diarrhea, piles or cough, or using as a fragrance and ornamental properties. Therefore, &quot;Nymphaceae alba&quot; (water lily) is collected in the wild and displayed in the market.

<doc id="963222" wikidata="Q321199" url="?curid=963222" title="William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington">
<text>William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington, (20 May 1763 – 22 February 1845), known as Lord Maryborough between 1821 and 1842, was an Anglo-Irish politician and an elder brother of the Duke of Wellington. His surname changed twice: he was born with the name Wesley, which he changed to Wesley-Pole following an inheritance in 1781. In 1789 the spelling was updated to Wellesley-Pole, just as other members of the family had changed Wesley to Wellesley.

==Origins==

He was born as William Wesley, at Dangan Castle, the second son of Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, by his marriage to Annie Hill, a daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon. He was the younger brother of Richard Wesley, later Marquess Wellesley, and the elder brother of Arthur, who became Duke of Wellington, and of Henry, who became Lord Cowley.

==Early life==
Wesley was educated at Eton (1774–1776) before entering the Royal Navy as a midshipman, serving in the Navy between 1777 and 1783; most notably aboard HMS &quot;Lion&quot;, a new ship launched in 1777, at the Battle of Grenada of 1779.

==Pole inheritance==
Due to the debts of their father, the Wesley family entered into financial stringency. This was partially alleviated following the death in 1781 of the childless William Pole, of Ballyfin in Ireland, his godfather and the husband of his great-aunt Ann Colley, who bequeathed his estates to Wesley, on the condition which was usual in such situations that he should adopt the surname &quot;Pole&quot;. 

Pole was descended from Peryam Pole, third son of the antiquary Sir William Pole (1561–1635) of Shute House, Devon, a brother of Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet. He had married Ann Colley, the sister of Wesley&#x27;s grandfather Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington (1690–1758). This Wesley had been born Richard Colley, but had changed his name in 1728, following an inheritance, to Wesley. Thus it was that in 1781, in accordance with the Will of his great-uncle William Pole, Wesley changed his name to Wesley-Pole.

==Political career==
A Tory, Mornington was a Member of the Irish Parliament for Trim from 1783 to 1790, and of the British House of Commons for East Looe from 1790 to 1795, and Queen&#x27;s County from 1801 to 1821. He served as Secretary of the Admiralty under the Duke of Portland between 1807 and 1809, and as Chief Secretary for Ireland under Spencer Perceval between 1809 and 1812, and was also a Lord of the Irish Treasury between 1809 and 1811 and Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer between 1811 and 1812. 

Mornington was sworn of both the British Privy Council and the Irish Privy Council in 1809. He served in Lord Liverpool&#x27;s government from 1814 to 1823 as Master of the Mint. In 1821, he was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Maryborough, of Maryborough in the Queen&#x27;s County (now Portlaoise, County Laois). 

In 1823, he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Queen&#x27;s County for life. From 1823 to 1830 he was Master of the Buckhounds and from 1834 to 1835 Postmaster General. From 1838 he held the honorary position of Captain of Deal Castle.

==Succession to earldom==
On the death in 1842 of his elder brother Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, he succeeded as 3rd Earl of Mornington.

==Marriage and progeny==
In 1784, Lord Mornington married Katherine Elizabeth Forbes, daughter of Admiral John Forbes and granddaughter of George Forbes, 3rd Earl of Granard, and of William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex. It was said that among the 1st Earl&#x27;s sons, they had the only happy marriage. They had the following progeny, one son and three daughters:
*William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, 4th Earl of Mornington, (1788–1857), who married the wealthiest heiress in England, Catherine Tylney-Long, &quot;The Wiltshire Heiress&quot;. William was a notable rake, and their marriage was fraught with difficulties. 
*Lady Mary Charlotte Anne Wellesley (1786–1845), who married Sir Charles Bagot, Bart., G.C.B., on 22 July 1806. The couple had four sons and six daughters. The family accompanied their parents to Canada on the appointment of Sir Charles Bagot as Governor-General of British North America, on 12 January 1842. As the wife of a Governor-General in Canada, Lady Bagot assumed the title of &#x27;Her Excellency&#x27;, in Montreal in August 1842. After her husband&#x27;s death at Kingston, Ontario on 18 May 1843, she accompanied the remains to England. She died in London on 2 February 1845.
*Lady Emily Harriet (1792–1881), who in 1814 married Lord FitzRoy Somerset, later 1st Baron Raglan.
*Lady Priscilla Anne (1793–1879), who married John Fane, Lord Burghersh, later 11th Earl of Westmorland.
==Death==
He died on 22 February 1845.

<doc id="963229" wikidata="Q1377789" url="?curid=963229" title="Emily Hobhouse">
<text>Emily Hobhouse (9 April 1860 – 8 June 1926) was a British welfare campaigner, anti-war activist, and pacifist. She is primarily remembered for bringing to the attention of the British public, and working to change, the deprived conditions inside the British concentration camps in South Africa built to incarcerate Boer and African civilians during the Second Boer War.

==Early life==
Born in St Ive, near Liskeard in Cornwall, she was the daughter of Caroline (née Trelawny) and Reginald Hobhouse, an Anglican rector and the first Archdeacon of Bodmin. She was the sister of Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse, a peace activist and proponent of social liberalism. She was a second cousin of the peace activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse and was a major influence on him.

Her mother died when she was 20, and she spent the next fourteen years looking after her father who was in poor health. When her father died in 1895, she went to Minnesota in the United States to perform welfare work amongst Cornish mineworkers living there, the trip having been organised by the wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury. There she became engaged to John Carr Jackson and the couple bought a ranch in Mexico but this did not prosper, and the engagement was broken off. She returned to England in 1898 after losing most of her money in a speculative venture. Her wedding veil (which she never wore) hangs in the head office of the Oranje Vrouevereniging (Orange Women&#x27;s Society) in Bloemfontein, the first women&#x27;s welfare organisation in the Orange Free State, as a symbol of her commitment to the uplifting of women.

==Second Anglo-Boer War==
When the Second Anglo-Boer War broke out in South Africa in October 1899, a Liberal MP, Leonard Courtney, invited Hobhouse to become secretary of the women&#x27;s branch of the South African Conciliation Committee, of which he was president. She wrote: It was late in the summer of 1900 that I first learnt of the hundreds of Boer women that became impoverished and were left ragged by our military operations… the poor women who were being driven from pillar to post, needed protection and organized assistance.

She founded the South African Women and Children Distress Fund and sailed for the Cape Colony on 7 December 1900 to supervise its distribution and arrived on 27 December. She wrote later:I came quite naturally, in obedience to the feeling of unity or oneness of womanhood ... it is when the community is shaken to its foundations, that abysmal depths of privation call to each other and that a deeper unity of humanity evinces itself.

When she left England, she did not know about the concentration camps, but on arrival, she learnt about their existence. She only knew about the scorched-earth policy and its devastation.
She had a letter of introduction to the British High Commissioner, Alfred Milner, from her aunt, the wife of Arthur Hobhouse, himself the son of Henry Hobhouse, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Home Office under Sir Robert Peel, and who knew Milner. 
From him she obtained the use of two railway trucks, subject to the approval of the army commander, Lord Kitchener, which she received two weeks later, although it only allowed her to travel as far as Bloemfontein and take one truck of supplies for the camps, about 12 tons.

==Conditions in the British concentration camps==

Hobhouse had persuaded the authorities to let her visit several British concentration camps and to deliver. Her 40-page report on conditions at the camps, set entitled &quot;Report of a Visit to the Camps of Women and Children in the Cape and Orange River Colonies&quot;, was published on the 18th of 1901 in England.

As a result, a formal commission was set up and a team of official investigators headed by Millicent Fawcett was sent to inspect the camps. Overcrowding in bad, unhygienic conditions due to bad planning, poor rations, diseases, and exposure to the elements led to a high mortality rate in the eighteen months during which the camps were in operation. Some 34,000 white women and children and between 15,000 and 25,000 black women and children - of which 80% were under 16 years died. https://www.amazon.com/Emily-Hobhouse-Feminist-Pacifist-Traitor/dp/1472140915

The following extracts from the report by Emily Hobhouse make v clear the extent of culpable neglect by the authorities:

In some camps, two, and even three sets of people, occupy one tent and 10, and even 12, persons are frequently herded together in tents of which the cubic capacity is about 500 c.f.

I call this camp system a wholesale cruelty… To keep these Camps going is murder to the children.

 It presses hardest on the children. They droop in the terrible heat, and with the insufficient unsuitable food; whatever you do, whatever the authorities do, and they are, I believe, doing their best with very limited means, it is all only a miserable patch on a great ill. Thousands, physically unfit, are placed in conditions of life which they have not strength to endure. E.

The women are wonderful. They cry very little and never complain. The very magnitude of their sufferings, their indignities, loss and anxiety seems to lift them beyond tears… only when it cuts afresh at them through their children do their feelings flash out.

===The bell tents===
Imagine the heat outside the tents and the suffocation inside! ...the sun blazed through the single canvas, and the flies lay thick and black on everything; no chair, no table, nor any room for such; only a deal box, standing on its end, served as a wee pantry.
All the morning the gangways are filled with the blankets and odds and ends, regularly turned out to dry in the sun. The doctor told me today he highly disapproved of tents for young children and expected a high mortality before June.

===Hygiene===
Soap has been unattainable, and none given in the rations. With much persuasion, and weeks after requisitioning, soap is now given occasionally in very minute quantities–certainly not enough for clothes and personal washing.
We have much typhoid and are dreading an outbreak, so I am directing my energies to getting the water of the Modder River boiled. As well swallow typhoid germs whole as drink that water–so say doctors.
Yet they cannot boil it all, for – first, fuel is very scarce; that which is supplied weekly would not cook a meal a day…and they have to search the already bare &quot;kopjes&quot; for a supply. There is hardly a bit to be had. Second, they have no extra utensil to hold the water when boiled. I propose, therefore, to give each tent a pail or crock, and get a proclamation issued that all drinking water must be boiled.

===The &quot;cruel system&quot;===
Above all one would hope that the good sense, if not the mercy, of the English people, will cry out against the further development of this cruel system which falls with crushing effect upon the old, the weak, and the children. May they stay the order to bring in more and yet more. Since Old Testament days was ever a whole nation carried captive?

Historian Thomas Pakenham writes of Kitchener&#x27;s policy turn:
No doubt the continued &#x27;hullabaloo&#x27; at the death rate in these concentration camps, and Milner&#x27;s belated agreement to take over their administration, helped changed K&#x27;s mind [some time at the end of 1901]. By mid-December, at any rate, Kitchener was already circulating all column commanders with instructions not to bring in women and children when they cleared the country but to leave them with the guerrillas... Viewed as a gesture to Liberals, on the eve of the new session of Parliament at Westminster, it was a shrewd political move. It also made excellent military sense, as it greatly handicapped the guerrillas, now that the drives were in full swing... It was effective precisely because, contrary to the Liberals&#x27; convictions, it was less humane than bringing them into camps, though this was of no great concern to Kitchener.

Charles Aked, a Baptist minister in Liverpool, said on 22 December 1901, Peace Sunday: &quot;Great Britain cannot win the battles without resorting to the last despicable cowardice of the most loathsome cur on earth—the act of striking a brave man&#x27;s heart through his wife&#x27;s honour and his child&#x27;s life. The cowardly war has been conducted by methods of barbarism... the concentration camps have been Murder Camps.&quot; Afterwards, a crowd followed him home and broke the windows of his house.

===Bloemfontein Concentration Camp===
Hobhouse arrived at the camp at Bloemfontein on 24 January 1901 and was shocked by the conditions she encountered:
They went to sleep without any provision having been made for them and without anything to eat or to drink. I saw crowds of them along railway lines in bitterly cold weather, in pouring rain–hungry, sick, dying and dead. Soap was not dispensed. The water supply was inadequate. No bedstead or mattress was procurable. Fuel was scarce and had to be collected from the green bushes on the opes of the &quot;kopjes&quot; (small hills) by the people themselves. The rations were extremely meagre and when, as I frequently experienced, the actual quantity dispensed fell short of the amount prescribed, it simply meant famine.

When Hobhouse requested soap for the people, she was told soap was a luxury. She nevertheless succeeded, after a struggle, to have it listed as a necessity, together with straw, more tents and more kettles in which to boil the drinking water.

Crass male ignorance, helplessness and muddling… I rub as much salt into the sore places in their minds… because it is good for them; but I can&#x27;t help melting a little when they are very humble and confess that the whole thing is a grievous and gigantic blunder and presents almost insoluble problems, and they don&#x27;t know how to face it.

Hobhouse also visited camps at Norvalspont, Aliwal-North, Springfontein, Kimberley, Mafekeng, and the Orange River Camp.

==Fawcett Commission==
When Hobhouse returned to England, she received criticism and hostility from the British government and the press. The British Liberal leader at the time, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, denounced what he called the &quot;methods of barbarism&quot;. The British government eventually agreed to set up the Fawcett Commission to investigate her claims, under Millicent Fawcett, which corroborated her account of the shocking conditions. However, Hobhouse was never acknowledged for her work contribution in their report.

Hobhouse returned to Cape Town in October 1901, but was not permitted to land, and was deported five days after arriving. Previously the government agreed she should not be allowed back into the country. 

She felt she never received justice for her work. Early the next year Hobhouse went to Lake Annecy in the French Alps where she wrote the book &quot;The Brunt of the War and Where it Fell&quot; on what she had seen during the war in South Africa.

==Rehabilitation and reconciliation==
After the war Hobhouse returned to South Africa where to see the effects of the scorched earth policy. With the help of Margaret Clark she decided to set up The Boer Home Industries with the first being in Philippolis and to teach young women spinning and weaving and lace making in 1908.

Ill health, forced her to return to England in 1908. She travelled to South Africa again in 1913 for the inauguration of the National Women&#x27;s Monument in Bloemfontein but had to stop at Beaufort West due to her failing health.

Her speech, which focused on forgiveness, women&#x27;s rights, the misuse of power and equal rights, was read on her behalf. Shortly afterwards she met Mahatma Gandhi in Cape Town.

==Later life==
Hobhouse was an avid opponent of the First World War and protested vigorously against it. She organised the writing, signing and publishing in January 1915 of the &quot;Open Christmas Letter&quot;, addressed &quot;To the Women of Germany and Austria&quot;. Through her offices, thousands children were fed daily for more than a year in central Europe after this war. South Africa contributed liberally towards this effort, and an amount of more than £17,000 (nearly £500,000 today) was collected by Mrs. President Steyn (who was to remain a lifelong friend) and sent to Hobhouse for this purpose.

==South African honorary citizenship==
She became an honorary citizen of South Africa for her humanitarian work there. Unbeknown to her, on the initiative of Mrs R. I. Steyn, a sum of £2,300 was collected by South Africans and with that Emily purchased a house in St Ives, Cornwall, which now forms part of Porthminster Hotel. In this hotel a commemorative plaque, situated within what was her lounge, was unveiled by the South African High Commissioner, Mr Kent Durr, as a tribute to her humanitarianism and heroism during the Anglo Boer War.

==Death==
Hobhouse died in Kensington on the 9th of June, 1926. Her ashes were ensconced in a niche in the National Women&#x27;s Monument at Bloemfontein, where she was regarded as a heroine. Her death went unreported in the Cornish press.

==Historical attraction==
In 2024, a new historical attraction to honour Emily Hobhouse&#x27;s life and work opened in St Ive, near Liskeard in Cornwall. The Story of Emily is about the life and times of this extraordinary woman.
Visitors can explore the Victorian world of the Hobhouse family set in 1875. In the restored old Rectory, where Emily lived from her birth until she was 34 years old.

In the War Rooms, the extraordinary impact Emily had on events in the Anglo-Boer War is told through installations, animations, films, virtual reality, décor, historical pictures, and original artefacts.
South African heritage food is served in the Restaurant.

==Legacy==

*The southernmost town in Eastern Free State is named Hobhouse after her.
*The SAS &quot;Emily Hobhouse&quot;, one of the South African Navy&#x27;s three Daphné class submarines, was named after her in 1969. In 1994, after the end of minority rule, the submarine was renamed the SAS &quot;Umkhonto&quot;.
*In Bloemfontein, South Africa, the oldest residence on the campus of the University of the Free State is named after Hobhouse.
*There is a statue of Hobhouse at the parish church at St Ive, Cornwall, where she was born.
*In 1990 Dirk de Villiers directed the South African film &quot;That Englishwoman: An Account of the Life of Emily Hobhouse&quot; with Veronica Lang as Emily.
*The 2021 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot; features a character named Emily Oxford, who bears a strong resemblance to Hobhouse. She is depicted as an activist criticizing the conditions of Britain&#x27;s concentration camps in South Africa during the Second Boer War.
*In 2022, the University of Exeter Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Cornwall at Penryn Campus named a meeting room after her in Peter Lanyon Building.

<doc id="963244" wikidata="Q6064430" url="?curid=963244" title="Iowa Hawkeyes football">
<text>The Iowa Hawkeyes football program represents the University of Iowa in college football. The Hawkeyes compete in the Big Ten Conference. Iowa joined the Conference (then known as the Western Conference or Big Nine) in 1899 and played their first Conference football season in 1900. They are a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Hawkeyes play their home games in Iowa City, Iowa, at Kinnick Stadium, with a capacity of 69,250. The Hawkeyes are coached by Kirk Ferentz, who is in his 26th season as the head coach and is the longest current tenured head coach in NCAA Division I FBS. The Hawkeyes have won 13 conference championships (including 11 in the Big Ten). Iowa has been ranked #1 in the AP and Coaches Poll 15 times.

==History of the team==

===Early history===

Football was first played as a club sport at Iowa in 1872, with intramural games against other colleges played as early as 1882, but it was not until 1889 that the University of Iowa first officially recognized a varsity football team. Beginning in 1892, Iowa played for six seasons as a member of the Western Interstate University Football Association against three other Midwestern flagship state universities. In 1899, again playing as an independent, Iowa completed its first undefeated football season, which led to an invitation to join the Western Conference, now known as the Big Ten Conference. In 1900, the Hawkeyes finished another undefeated season and won a share of the Western Conference title in their first year of conference play. In 1907, Iowa helped form the new Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association with the other three university members of the former WIUFA and participated in football in the new league, while retaining its existing membership in the Western Conference. Iowa tied for the league championship in the first season of competition, but would leave the conference soon thereafter to return to sole competition in the Western Conference.

===Howard Jones era and 1920s===
Iowa claimed consecutive Big Ten titles in 1921 and 1922, and were recognized as national champions in those years. The Hawkeyes won 20 straight games in the early 1920s under the guidance of Hall of Fame coach Howard Jones. But Jones soon left Iowa and established a powerhouse at Southern California, and the Hawkeyes were abysmal for most of the 1930s.

===1929 Big Ten suspension===
Iowa was expelled from the Big Ten on May 25, 1929. The reasons were officially unstated and university president Walter Jessup professed not to know why the faculty committee voted to expel the university. Suspicions of player compensation and Iowa&#x27;s inaction to address alleged ethics violations appear to have been the main cause. Following the 1929 season, the Big Ten faculty committee unanimously voted to reinstate Iowa to the conference on February 1, 1930. On December 11, 1929, Iowa had disqualified 27 players, presumably due to compensation issues, and was advised not to seek reinstatement of any of those players.

===Eddie Anderson era (1939–1942, 1946–1949)===
Little was expected of Iowa&#x27;s 1939 team based upon its overall record in the decade, but led by their new coach Eddie Anderson the team exceeded expectations and had a glorious run. Nicknamed the &quot;Ironmen&quot; because a small number of players shouldered the brunt of the time played, the 1939 Hawkeyes scored several upset victories and vaulted into the national rankings. Though Iowa fell a game short of winning the Big Ten title, team MVP Nile Kinnick won almost every major national award, including the 1939 Heisman Trophy.

===Forest Evashevski era (1952–1960)===
Forest Evashevski was hired as Iowa&#x27;s head coach in 1952. He lured Calvin Jones to Iowa, where Jones became the first Hawkeye – and the first African-American – to win the Outland Trophy in 1955. From 1956 to 1960, Evashevski led Iowa to four finishes in the top five of the national rankings, three Big Ten Conference titles, two Rose Bowl victories (in 1957 and 1959), and the 1958 FWAA national championship. After the 1960 season, Evashevski left coaching to become Iowa&#x27;s athletic director.

====The Forgotten Season====
In 1960 the Hawkeyes held on to the No. 1 ranking for much of the season. The Hawkeyes defeated No. 8 Ohio State, No. 15 Michigan State, and No. 10 Purdue. Iowa lost to rival No. 3 Minnesota. The game was the only loss of the year for the 1960 Hawkeyes and they shared the Big Ten title with Minnesota. However, at that time, the Big Ten did not allow their teams to go to any bowl except for the Rose Bowl. As such, Minnesota was picked over Iowa to go to Pasadena and Iowa was left out, despite a No. 2 ranking in the Coaches&#x27; Poll and a No. 3 ranking in the AP. Minnesota went on to win the National Championship, as the final AP poll was conducted before their Rose Bowl loss to Washington. This season is known as the &quot;Forgotten Season&quot;, for despite ending the season with a No. 2/3 ranking and a share of the Big Ten title, the Hawks were left out of January play.

===1960s and 70s===
Evashevski&#x27;s departure from the sidelines began a two-decade downturn in Iowa&#x27;s fortunes. Jerry Burns coached from 1961 though 1965. He had a 16–27–2 record. His first team finished 5–4, which would be Iowa&#x27;s last winning record for 20 years. Ray Nagel followed from 1966 to 1970 with a 16–32–2 record. A 3-3-2 record in 1963 and consecutive 5–5 records in 1968 and 1969 would be the Hawks&#x27; only non-losing records from 1962 to 1980. Frank Lauterbur followed, coaching from 1971 to 1973 with a 4–28–1 record, with a 0–11 record in 1973. Bob Commings coached the Hawkeyes from 1974 to 1978. His record was 18 wins and 37 losses.

===Hayden Fry era (1979–1998)===
Hall of Fame coach Hayden Fry was hired after the 1978 season to reverse Iowa&#x27;s fortunes. Considering the awful state of the program upon his arrival, Fry didn&#x27;t take long to return the Hawkeyes to respectability. In his third year, Fry led the Hawkeyes to their first winning season in 21 years, a share of the Big Ten title, and a berth in the Rose Bowl–only the third bowl appearance in school history. He had vowed to resign if he didn&#x27;t get the Hawkeyes to a bowl within four years.

Fry would go on to lead the Hawkeyes to three Big Ten titles (one outright, two shared) and 14 bowl games (including two more Rose Bowls in 1986 and 1991). His best team was the 1985 unit, which won a then school-record 10 games and garnered Iowa&#x27;s first outright Big Ten title in 27 years. That team spent most of October ranked No. 1 in both major polls, the highest they had been ranked that far into the season in two decades. Among the legacies that Fry left behind is the now iconic Tiger Hawk logo and a widely reviled pink visitors&#x27; locker room (better to &quot;calm&quot; the opponents). Fry retired in 1998, turning the program over to his former assistant Kirk Ferentz.

===Kirk Ferentz era (1999–present)===

Ferentz led Iowa to three consecutive top-10 finishes from 2002 to 2004 and two Big Ten titles. The Hawkeyes have been invited to 21 bowl games in the past 23 seasons, and in 35 bowl games over the last 42 seasons. Kirk Ferentz has been the head coach since Hayden Fry&#x27;s retirement after the 1998 season, and has led the team to a number of Bowl appearances, including two Orange Bowls (2003, 2010) and the 2016 Rose Bowl. Iowa has cracked the Top 25 at the end of the season eleven times during the Kirk Ferentz era – No. 8 in 2002, 2003, and 2004, No. 20 in 2008, No. 7 in 2009, No. 9 in 2015, No. 25 in 2018, No. 15 in 2019, No.16 in 2020, No. 23 in 2021 and No. 24 in 2023. Under Ferentz, Iowa won the Big Ten West division three times (2015, 2021 &amp; 2023).

==Conference affiliations==

==Championships==

===National championships===
Iowa has been selected national champion five times by NCAA-designated major selectors, in 1921, 1922, 1956, 1958, and 1960. Iowa claims national championships for all five seasons.

Iowa finished the 1958 regular season with a 7–1–1 record and a No. 2 ranking in the major wire-service polls—the AP Poll and the Coaches&#x27; Poll—and won the 1959 Rose Bowl convincingly over No. 16 and 7–3 California, 38–12, setting or tying six Rose Bowl records. The AP and Coaches&#x27; Polls had named 10–0 Louisiana State as national champions at the end of the regular season. The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) awarded the Grantland Rice Trophy and their national championship to Iowa after the bowl games were played.

Iowa has never finished a season ranked No. 1 in either the AP or Coaches&#x27; Poll.

===Conference championships===
Iowa has won 13 conference championships in school history, eight shared and five outright, winning 11 with the Big Ten and 2 in other conferences.
† Co-champions

‡ Iowa was a member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1907 to 1911 in addition to their membership in the Big Ten. In 1928, the MVIAA split in two: the Big Six (which officially retained the MVIAA name; would become the Big Eight in later years) and the Missouri Valley Conference (which retained the MVIAA administrative team). Since both leagues claim the same history from 1907 until the 1928 split, conference champions during that time are listed as conference champions of the respective leagues.

===Division championships===
Iowa has three Big Ten division championships.
==Bowl games==
Iowa has appeared in 37 bowl games, including 35 bowl games since 1981. In bowl games, Iowa has a 18–18–1 record. The team also accepted a bid to the 2020 Music City Bowl, which was subsequently canceled due to an outbreak of COVID-19 on the opposing team.

==Head coaches==
^ Eddie Anderson did not coach during the 1943–1945 seasons to serve in World War II.

–Iowa did not hire their first head coach until 1892, even though their football program began in 1889. They have had 25 total head coaches in their program&#x27;s history.

==Rivalries==

===Iowa State===
Iowa plays Iowa State annually for the Cy-Hawk Trophy, which began in 1977. The teams&#x27; first meeting was in 1894. The teams quit meeting after the 1934 season until they renewed their rivalry in 1977. It was in 1977 that the tradition of the Cy-Hawk Trophy began, when the Des Moines Athletic Club donated a trophy dedicated to the rivalry. It was quickly dubbed the &quot;Cy-Hawk Trophy&quot;. Iowa leads the trophy series 31–16, and the overall series 47–24 through the 2024 season. The game is currently held in early September near Patriot Day.

===Minnesota===
Iowa plays Minnesota annually for the Floyd of Rosedale, which is Iowa&#x27;s oldest trophy game that began in 1935. The teams&#x27; first meeting was in 1891. 
Floyd of Rosedale was created in 1935 after Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson bet a prize pig that the Gophers would win the game, a goal which the Gophers would accomplish that year. After the death of the pig, its image was cast in bronze, and the Floyd of Rosedale trophy was created. Iowa leads the trophy series 45–43–2 while Minnesota leads the overall series 63–53–2 through the 2024 season.

===Nebraska===
Iowa plays Nebraska annually for the Heroes Trophy, which began when Nebraska joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011. Since the inauguration of the series as a conference game, the game has been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving. Iowa leads the trophy series 10–4, while Nebraska leads the overall series 30–22–3 through the 2024 season.

===Wisconsin===
Iowa has played Wisconsin for the Heartland Trophy since 2004. The teams&#x27; first meeting was in 1894. Wisconsin leads the trophy series at 10–9 and the overall series 49–47–2 through the 2024 season.

==Logos and uniforms==
Iowa&#x27;s home jersey is black with white numerals, with gold and white stripes on the sleeves. The away jersey is white with black numerals, and gold stripes on the sleeves. Players&#x27; names are located above the numerals on the back of the jersey. Gold pants with a black stripe are worn with both the home and away jersey. Iowa&#x27;s helmets are black with a black facemask. They also have a gold stripe and the gold Iowa Hawkeye logo included on both sides of the helmet.

In 1979, Hayden Fry helped to create the Tiger Hawk, the logo seen on Iowa&#x27;s football helmets. Since both teams shared the colors of black and yellow gold, Fry sought and gained permission from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the dominant National Football League (NFL) team of the 1970s, to overhaul Iowa&#x27;s uniforms in the Steelers&#x27; image. Fry&#x27;s idea was that if the team were going to act like winners, they first needed to dress like winners. Fry had originally asked Steelers defensive tackle &quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene for a replica helmet and home jersey; Greene was able to send Fry to one of the team owners, and three days later, the owners sent Fry reproduction copies of the home and away uniform of Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw, making Iowa one of only a few schools to use the uniform scheme of an NFL team; others include the Blue Devils of Duke University whose football uniforms resemble those of the Indianapolis Colts. Although the uniforms appear substantially the same, there are subtle differences, mainly in the font of the numerals, the scheme of the white away jerseys, and the width of the pants and jersey stripes.

The Hawkeyes have removed the Tiger Hawk helmet logo and the single yellow gold stripe from their game helmets on five occasions as a symbolic gesture of mourning. The first instance was on November 2, 1991, in recognition of the six victims of a fatal campus shooting. The second occasion was for a December 29, 1996, appearance in the Alamo Bowl. It served to commemorate the family of linebacker Mark Mitchell, who were involved in a fatal vehicle accident while en route to the game. The accident resulted in the death of Mitchell&#x27;s mother and severe injuries to his father and two brothers. Third came on Veterans&#x27; Day 2011 when they used a red, white, and blue Tiger Hawk on one side and left the other side blank in honor of our fallen heroes against Michigan. Fourth was September 12, 2015, when they honored Tyler Sash, former Iowa Safety and NFL Veteran, who had died on September 8, 2015. To honor Sash, one Tiger Hawk was replaced with a large, gold &quot;#9&quot; a tribute to the jersey number Sash wore while he played at Iowa. The Tiger Hawk was removed for a fifth time during the 2019 Holiday Bowl in San Diego, California to honor the passing of former Iowa Hawkeye football coach, Hayden Fry. The Hawkeyes have won all five memorial games.

The Iowa Athletic Director has okayed only seven stickers on the helmets from 1985 to the present. The first was in 1985, when a gold disk appeared, with the black letters &quot;&quot;ANF&quot;, which stands for America Needs Farmers. This sticker had remained in place until 1992 when the NCAA required teams to remove &#x27;excessive&#x27; decals. However, it was brought back by head coach Kirk Ferentz in 2009 and has remained in place since. The second was a small black sticker on the back of the helmet, with white letters that spelled out &quot;EVY&quot;, the nickname of legendary Iowa head coach, and athletic director, Forest Evashevski, to commemorate his death in 2009. The third was in memory of Iowa high school football coaching legend Ed Thomas, who was killed in his team&#x27;s weight room by a former player. A small gold sticker with the black letters &quot;FFF&quot;&quot; placed near the crown of the helmet represents &quot;Faith, Family, Football,&quot; a motto Coach Thomas preached to his players to represent what his players&#x27; priorities should be not only through the season, but throughout life. The fourth was a small green sticker, with the number 30 on it to honor former Hawkeye Safety Brett Greenwood, who had recently fallen into a coma while working out at his old high school. Fifth was a small black sticker with a gold &quot;TS&quot;, worn on the back of the helmet to commemorate the death of former Hawkeye safety Tyler Sash. Another decal was commissioned to honor former Polk County deputy sheriff Ron Stewart died on October 9, 2016, at the age of 76. Stewart volunteered his time providing security for the Iowa Football team at home and road games from 1982 to 2014. For the remainder of the season, the Hawkeyes wore a decal on the back of their helmets bearing his initials &quot;RS&quot; within a sheriff&#x27;s badge in his memory. Most recently, a special helmet decal was worn to honor former Iowa Hawkeye football player Damon Bullock, who died at the age of 25 in March 2019. For the 2019 season opener, the Hawkeyes wore a gold circle with black lettering detailing &quot;DB5&quot; on the back of their helmets, a nod to Bullock&#x27;s playing number from 2011 to 2014, in addition to a gold graduation cap, honoring the team&#x27;s recent graduates.

==Kinnick Stadium==

Nile Kinnick Stadium, formerly known as &quot;Iowa Stadium&quot;, is the home stadium of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes in Iowa City, Iowa. It opened as Iowa Stadium in 1929; prior to that time, Iowa played its home games at Iowa Field. Iowa Stadium was renamed &quot;Nile Kinnick Stadium&quot; in 1972 in honor of Nile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during World War II. It holds 69,250 people, making it the 25th largest college football stadium in America and the 82nd largest sports stadium in the world.

==Notable games==

===1953: No. 20 Iowa vs No. 1 Notre Dame===

On Nov. 21, 1953, an undefeated No. 1 ranked Notre Dame team was set to face the Hawkeyes in South Bend. In the first quarter, Iowa defensive back Dusty Rice intercepted the Irish, which allowed the Hawkeyes to drive the ball 72 yards for an Iowa touchdown and a 7–0 lead. With only 2 seconds left in the first half, Irish tackle Frank Varrichione fell down with an injury which stopped the clock (Notre Dame had no time outs left). Varrichione went in that same play and the Irish scored on a touchdown pass to Dan Shannon, to tie the game 7–7 at the half. With the score still deadlocked late into the fourth quarter, Iowa intercepted a pass on their own 48-yard line. The Hawkeyes then scored on a touchdown pass to end Frank Gilliam to give the Hawkeyes a 14–7 lead with 2:06 left in the game, with Notre Dame having no time outs remaining. With only 6 seconds left and the clock ticking away Frank Varrichione came down with another injury which stopped the clock (again he went back in that very same play). Notre Dame then scored a touchdown to tie the game up and stay unbeaten. After the game, sportswriters such as Grantland Rice and others were infuriated calling it unfair, and the Irish earned the label: &quot;The Fainting Irish of Notre Dame&quot;. Iowa head coach Forest Evashevski said after the game: &quot;When the One Great Scorer comes to write against our name, He won&#x27;t write whether we won or lost, but how come we got gypped at Notre Dame&quot;. The Hawkeyes, who were ranked No. 20 before the game, jumped teams with better records to gain the No. 9 ranking. Varrichione has since admitted that the injuries were fake, in Steve Delsohn&#x27;s book, &quot;Talking Irish: The Oral History Of Notre Dame Football&quot;. In addition, Notre Dame Heisman winner Johnny Lattner praised his team&#x27;s tactics calling it &quot;Pretty smart thinking, wasn&#x27;t it?&quot;. Because of this game, the NCAA changed the rules making players sit out at least one down before returning to the game.

===1956: No. 6 Ohio State at No. 7 Iowa===

On November 17, Iowa (ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll) defeated Ohio State (ranked No. 6), 6–0, before a crowd of 57,732 at Iowa Stadium. Ohio State went into the game with the second best rushing attack in the country but were held to 147 rushing yards, their lowest rushing yardage total in two years. The result broke Ohio State&#x27;s winning streak of 17 games against conference opponents and clinched for Iowa the conference championship and a berth in the Rose Bowl. After time expired, Iowa fans hauled down the goal posts and paraded through Iowa City.

===1957 Rose Bowl: No. 3 Iowa vs. No. 10 Oregon State===

Aided by three rushing touchdowns, the Big Ten Champion Iowa Hawkeyes got off to a 21–6 start at the half. After the half, Iowa scored two more touchdowns and beat Oregon State 35–19. With the victory, Iowa won their first Rose Bowl Game in program history. Quarterback Ken Ploen was the game&#x27;s MVP ending the game with one rushing touchdown and one passing touchdown.

===1959 Rose Bowl: No. 2 Iowa vs. No. 16 California===

This game was lopsided and by the end of the third quarter, with a 22–6 advantage over the California Golden Bears, Iowa could smell victory (eventually winning by a final margin of 38–12). With their win in the Rose Bowl in 1959, the No. 2 Iowa Hawkeyes (8–1–1) won the Grantland Rice Trophy (in recognition of the national champion) as awarded by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) following the bowl games.

No. 1 Louisiana State (11–0) was crowned national champions in both major polls, AP and Coaches&#x27;, before the bowl games were played. The LSU Tigers went on to claim a shutout victory in the Sugar Bowl over No. 12 Clemson.

===1981: No. 7 Nebraska at Iowa===

Official recap—There weren&#x27;t many among the 60,160 who jammed Iowa&#x27;s Kinnick Stadium who thought they were watching a matchup of the eventual Midwest entries in the Rose and Orange Bowls. There probably weren&#x27;t a whole lot more who thought Iowa would avenge a 57–0 slaughter the Hawkeyes had suffered in Lincoln the year before. However, Iowa took advantage of excellent field position to jump to a 10–0 first-half lead, then held on to win a 10–7 stunner over the seventh-ranked Huskers.

The Hawkeye defense held the Huskers to their lowest total offense output of the season—234 yards—and stopped the Nebraska offense three straight times in Iowa territory after Roger Craig&#x27;s one-yard TD had pulled the Huskers within 10–7 early in the final period. NU was stymied in the fourth quarter by a missed 30-yard field goal, a fumble, and Lou King&#x27;s diving interception, which secured Iowa&#x27;s victory with 39 seconds remaining.

In the first half, the Hawkeyes capitalized on a short punt and an interception to set up a two-yard TD run by Eddie Phillips and a 35-yard field goal by Lon Olejniczak. Meanwhile, the Huskers were held scoreless through three quarters for the first time since 1973 and didn&#x27;t get out of their own territory until late in the second period, partly because of Iowa punter Reggie Roby&#x27;s 50-plus yard average. NU quarterbacks Mark Maurer and Nate Mason completed only 8-of-18 passes for 81 yards and rushed 12 times for minus-2 yards.

Iowa used its upset win as a launching pad to defeat such teams as UCLA, Michigan and Purdue and post its first winning season since 1961.

&quot;At this minute, this is the greatest victory of my life,&quot; Iowa coach Hayden Fry said. &quot;I&#x27;m getting to be an old man and I don&#x27;t want to hurt any of my other teams that pulled off some upsets. But while I&#x27;ve been at Iowa, this is far and away the greatest victory.

&quot;If you stay with this game long enough, the worm is bound to turn. Don&#x27;t think we didn&#x27;t earn this one, either. We did it fair and square, plus we showed a lot of character.&quot;

===1985: No. 2 Michigan at No. 1 Iowa===
The Hawkeyes trailed 10–9 late in the fourth quarter, in what may be considered the greatest game played at Kinnick Stadium. Iowa got the ball, with 5:27 left, on their own 22-yard line. Led by their All-American Quarterback, Chuck Long, Iowa drove the ball to the Michigan 12-yard line. As the clock expired, kicker Rob Houghtlin sent one through the uprights, to give Iowa the win. The Hawkeyes would go on to accept an invitation to the 1986 Rose Bowl.

===2005 Capital One Bowl: No. 11 Iowa vs. No. 12 LSU (&quot;The Catch&quot;)===
The game has gone down in Hawkeye history known simply as &quot;The Catch&quot;. Iowa was set to play the defending National Champion LSU Tigers. Despite leading the entire game, Iowa found itself down 24–25 and got the ball with only 46 seconds left on the clock. With only a few seconds left in the game, Iowa found itself on their own 44-yard line facing a 2nd and 6. Iowa Quarterback Drew Tate threw the ball 56 yards to Warren Holloway for an Iowa touchdown that gave the Hawkeyes a 30–25 victory over Nick Saban&#x27;s defending champion Tigers. The touchdown was Holloway&#x27;s first and only career touchdown.

===2008: No. 3 Penn State at Iowa===
The undefeated Penn State Nittany Lions came into the game ranked No. 3 in the country with hopes of a BCS national championship. The Hawkeyes, on the other hand, were 5–4 and coming off a tough loss at Illinois. The Hawkeyes jumped out to an early lead following a Penn State sack-fumble on 3rd down during its first drive, but the Nittany Lions would come back to take a 13–7 lead into halftime. With less than four minutes left in the game, and trailing 23–21, Iowa strong safety Tyler Sash intercepted Penn State quarterback Daryll Clark&#x27;s pass inside Iowa territory. The Hawkeyes drove to within field goal range where kicker Daniel Murray made a 31-yard field goal with :01 left to play. Iowa would go on to win 24–23 and hand Penn State its only regular season loss of the year. The Hawkeyes would go on to beat South Carolina in the Outback Bowl. The win would be the first in a 13-game winning streak for Iowa stretching into the 2009 season.

===2010 Orange Bowl: No. 9 Georgia Tech vs. No. 10 Iowa===
The game pitted the ACC Champion Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets against No. 10 Iowa. On Iowa&#x27;s second drive of the game, quarterback Ricky Stanzi drove the Hawkeyes 80 yards, culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass to Marvin McNutt, putting Iowa on top 7–0. Iowa scored another touchdown on their next drive, following a Georgia Tech punt, with Stanzi hitting Colin Sandeman for 21 yards, extending the Hawkeyes lead to 14–0. On the ensuing drive, GT punted for the third time in a row. On Iowa&#x27;s next drive, Stanzi was intercepted by Jerrard Tarrant who returned the pick for a touchdown, cutting Iowa&#x27;s lead to 14–7. Georgia Tech received the ball at the start of the second half. Iowa took over on downs after Georgia Tech missed a 41-yard field goal. On Iowa&#x27;s next drive, they extended their lead by three thanks to a 33-yard field goal from kicker Daniel Murray. At the start of the 4th Quarter, Iowa had a 17–7 lead. This lead was cut when Georgia Tech drove down the field for its first and only offensive touchdown of the game. The touchdown cut Iowa&#x27;s lead to 17–14. However, Iowa running back Brandon Wegher sealed the win for the Hawkeyes with his 32-yard rushing touchdown late in the 4th Quarter. Iowa beat Georgia Tech by a final score of 24–14.

The win marked the first BCS Bowl win for the Iowa program (Iowa had won two Rose Bowls prior to the formation of the BCS). The win also marked Iowa&#x27;s first Orange Bowl victory. Iowa is one of only five Big Ten teams to compete in and win an Orange Bowl.

===2016: No. 2 Michigan at Iowa===
Iowa entered this matchup against the 9–0 Wolverines with a 5–4 record, a letdown given the high expectations entering the season. Michigan arrived in Iowa City with the No. 1 scoring defense and the No. 3 scoring offense in the country. A week after being humbled 41–14 at Penn State, in the midst of a three-game home losing streak, and after trailing 10–0 in the second quarter of this game, the Hawkeyes put forth a gritty, spirited effort. Freshman Keith Duncan drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired to deliver Iowa a much needed win. Akrum Wadley was the offensive standout for the Hawkeyes with 115 yards rushing, and another 52 yards receiving that included a touchdown late in the first half. The Hawkeye defense did their part as well, allowing only 201 total yards and scoring a safety in the 14–13 win.

With Clemson and Washington both losing, this marked only the second time No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 fell during the same day in the regular-season. The other time was October 19, 1985, and one of the games that day was No. 1 Iowa&#x27;s 12–10 win over No. 2 Michigan.

===2017: No. 3 Ohio State at Iowa===
Iowa entered this matchup against the 7–1 Buckeyes with a 5–3 record. At kickoff, the Buckeyes were ranked No. 6 in the nation and although the game was being played at Iowa&#x27;s Kinnick Stadium, Ohio State was a 21-point favorite to win. Early on, it was an even contest as the teams traded scores on their way to a 17–17 midway through the second quarter. However, in the last 3 minutes of the first half, Iowa TE Noah Fant was on the receiving end of two Nate Stanley TD passes, sending Iowa into the locker room with a 31–17 lead. The second half belonged to the Hawkeyes as they sliced through the Ohio State defense on TD drives of 78, 60 and 47 yards on their way to a resounding 55–24 win. Notable performances from the game were five TD passes by Iowa QB Nathan Stanley, Iowa CB Joshua Jackson&#x27;s 3 interceptions, Iowa RB Akrum Wadley rushing for 118 yards on 20 carries (5.9) and Ohio State QB J. T. Barrett throwing four INT&#x27;s along with three TD&#x27;s. On the day Iowa racked up a total of 487 yards against an Ohio State defense that came into the game only allowing 302 yards per contest. Many pundits remarked after the season that the lop-sided loss to Iowa was the reason that Ohio State was excluded from the College Football Playoff, even though the Buckeyes had won the Big Ten championship.

===2019: No. 8 Minnesota at No. 20 Iowa===
The Hawkeyes entered this game following a close road loss (24–22) at Wisconsin. Minnesota, on the other hand, was coming in with an undefeated 9–0 record and just off a home win against then-undefeated Penn State.

However, the Gophers&#x27; undefeated season would end during this match, as they fell 23–19 to the Hawkeyes, despite a late comeback rally. Iowa kept the Gophers outside the end zone for two quarters, forcing two Gopher field goals. At the end of the half, the Hawkeyes were up 20–6. The Gophers would respond mightily in the second half, both on offense and defense, outscoring their opponent 13–3 with two touchdowns, one in the third and one in the fourth quarter. They forced a turnover late in the fourth quarter with a chance to win the game, but back to back sacks on first and second down sidelined quarterback Tanner Morgan with an injury, and Cole Kramer had to step in on a 3rd down and 21. His hail mary attempt was ultimately intercepted by Riley Moss, clinching the Hawkeyes&#x27; upset.

Minnesota would clinch the Big Ten West and play Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship if they won this match, even if they were to later fall to Wisconsin in the season finale, since the Badgers had two conference losses. However, this loss opened the door for Wisconsin to regain a shot at winning the West, which they were able to pull off by upsetting the Gophers on the road.

This was also the first of four straight wins for Iowa to end the season. Many pundits called them the &quot;strongest 3-loss team in the country&quot; prior to the game, as they lost in three road games by a total of 14 points to conference powers Michigan, Penn State and Wisconsin. Since 2008, Iowa is 5–1 against AP-top 10 teams at home, their lone loss coming in 2017 to Penn State on a touchdown pass as the clock expired.

===2021: No. 3 Iowa vs No. 4 Penn State===
Extending from the previous season, Penn State was on a 10-game winning streak and Iowa was on a 12-game winning streak. Both teams were ranked in the Top 5 and Fox&#x27;s Big Noon Kickoff came to Iowa City for the game.

Penn State jumped out to an early 17–3 lead before Iowa closed the gap to 7 by the end of the half. In the 3rd Quarter Penn State would extend the lead to 20–10, but the Nittany Lions would not score again in the game. Iowa would again close the gap to 7 points with a field goal to close out scoring in the 3rd Quarter. Iowa scored another field goal and a touchdown in the 4th Quarter which was enough to give Iowa the 24–20 win. After the game, Iowa extended its season record to 6–0 and obtained its third win over a ranked team in the early season. As a result of Alabama&#x27;s loss to Texas A&amp;M, Iowa would go on to be ranked #2 in the AP and Coaches Poll the following week.

==Traditions==

===Songs===
Iowa&#x27;s official fight song is the &quot;Iowa Fight Song&quot; which is sung by the marching band and the fans. Iowa&#x27;s school song is &quot;On Iowa&quot;. Iowa also plays a third fight song, entitled &quot;Roll Along Iowa&quot;. After victories the band plays the Im Himmel gibt&#x27;s kein Bier Polka, which translates to &quot;In Heaven There is No Beer&quot;. Before the game (since 2005) the team has exited the tunnel together to &quot;Back in Black&quot; by AC/DC before joining hands and running onto the field in unison to &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; by Metallica. This became known as &quot;The Swarm.&quot;

===Mascot===
Iowa&#x27;s mascot is Herky the Hawk, a black and gold caricature of a Hawk. Herky was created as a cartoon in 1948, and first appeared at a sporting event in 1959. Herky was actually named after the Greek God Hercules. The term &quot;Hawkeye&quot; originally appeared in the 19th century historical novel The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper; it was later used in its plural form to describe the people of the state of Iowa. The University of Iowa adopted this as the nickname for its athletic teams.

===Hawkeye Marching Band===

Founded in 1881, the Hawkeye Marching Band now performs at all Iowa Hawkeye home football games. The band also travels with the team to usually one away game per year and any post-season bowl games.

===Kinnick Wave===
In 2017, Hawkeyes fans created what ESPN called &quot;college football&#x27;s coolest new tradition&quot;. In February of that year, the university&#x27;s children&#x27;s hospital, which has long had a close relationship with the Iowa football program, opened a new 12-story building across the street from Kinnick Stadium, with the top few floors featuring an unobstructed view of the playing field. The top floor of the hospital features the Press Box Café, a lounge area with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the field that is reserved for patients and their families on Hawkeyes game days, with big-screen TVs available when Iowa plays on the road. Following a suggestion posted to a Hawkeyes fan page on Facebook, by Iowan Krista Young, fans now face the hospital and wave to the children and their families at the end of the first quarter of every home game. For home night games, the first of which was against Penn State on September 23, 2017, &quot;The Wave&quot; features fans waving with their cell phone flashlights turned on. Two weeks after the Penn State game, with the Hawkeyes at home against Illinois, the Hawkeye Marching Band joined in this new tradition, forming a hand moving side-to-side and &quot;waving&quot; at the children during its halftime show. The Wave was even seen in the offseason—on February 15, 2018, inspired by a suggestion from nurses at the children&#x27;s hospital, the stadium&#x27;s maintenance crew created a pattern of a waving hand in snow that was covering the playing field. At least one patient was reported to have seen the crew creating the design, and upon completion, the crew went into the Press Box Café to see their final product.

The tradition has even spread beyond the Iowa fan base. With Iowa playing at Michigan State on September 30, ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot; aired a six-minute feature on The Wave, followed by the feature&#x27;s reporter, Tom Rinaldi, leading the crowd at the Virginia Tech campus in a wave of their own. A few hours later at the end of the first quarter of the Iowa–Michigan State game, Spartans fans joined in The Wave with visiting Iowa fans.

Disney Sports announced it would present the Iowa football program with its Disney&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Spirit Award, which annually goes to college football&#x27;s most inspirational figure on November 20, 2017. The award was presented to the University of Iowa for The Wave on ESPN on December 7, 2017.

<text>The Rickettsiales, informally called rickettsias, are an order of small Alphaproteobacteria. They are obligate intracellular parasites, and some are notable pathogens, including &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, which causes a variety of diseases in humans, and &quot;Ehrlichia&quot;, which causes diseases in livestock. Another genus of well-known Rickettsiales is the &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, which infect about two-thirds of all arthropods and nearly all filarial nematodes. Genetic studies support the endosymbiotic theory according to which mitochondria and related organelles developed from members of this group.

The Rickettsiales are difficult to culture, as they rely on living eukaryotic host cells for their survival.

== Rickettsiales phylogeny ==
The Rickettsiales further consist of three known families, the Rickettsiaceae, the Midichloriaceae, and the Ehrlichiaceae. Most studies also support the inclusion of the Holosporaceae, but one study has challenged this view. In that alternative, the Holosporaceae are the sole representatives of their own order, the Holosporales, and as such not part of the Rickettsiales (see the schematic tree below). Other lineages, not clearly part of any family, have been described, as well. Examples include &quot;Candidatus&quot; Arcanobacter lacustris and Rickettsiales bacterium Ac37b.
=== Phylogenetic relationship between Rickettsiales and Pelagibacterales (SAR11) ===
The phylogenetic relationship between these two groups has yet to reach consensus in the scientific literature.

Early reports suggested that they represented sister clades to each other. However, later studies suggested that this relationship is false and was due to a phylogenetic artefact, which artificially groups independent AT-rich and fast-evolving lineages (Rickettsiales and Pelagibacterales have both properties) together. Upon correcting for this artefact, the Pelagibacterales form a sister clade to the Hyphomicrobiales, Rhodobacterales and Caulobacterales instead.

Another study adheres to the sister relationship between the two clades (see schematic tree). In their classification, the relation between the two orders is retained in the subclass, the Rickettsidae, which include the Rickettsiales, the Pelagibacteriales, and the extinct protomitochondrion (mitochondria themselves are not bacteria, but organelles).

== Reductive evolution ==
Rickettsiales genomes are undergoing reductive evolution and are typically small (generally &lt; 1.5 Mbp), AT-rich (generally &lt; 40% GC) with a low coding density (generally &lt; 85%) and a relatively high number of pseudogenes. Reduction in genome size, % GC and coding density and genes are generally attributed to genetic drift and Muller&#x27;s ratchet. Genetic drift is enhanced in Rickettsiales genomes due to low population sizes (given their endosymbiotic nature) and frequent population bottlenecks. Similarly, Muller&#x27;s ratchet is activated through the lack of recombination and horizontal gene transfer (the eukaryotic host cell is a natural barrier).

<text>Capdown is an English punk rock band from Milton Keynes. Originally known as Soap, their songs have political themes as alluded to by their name, which is a portmanteau of Capitalist Downfall. Mixing ska, punk, hardcore, dub, drum and bass, and reggae, Capdown built a reputation around their independent releases and numerous tours.

==Career==
The band members had been playing together since the age of 14. The band, originally known as Soap, had sent the demo of the &quot;Time For Change&quot; EP to the indie Household Name Records in 1998 and had played a gig with Link 80 at the record company&#x27;s request, which led to them being signed onto the label. The EP was released in 1999 under the new name of the band, Capdown (short for Capitalist Downfall).

In May 2000, Household Name Records released Capdown&#x27;s debut album &quot;Civil Disobedients&quot;. The album featured hardcore, but also mixed in ska and dub. According to Drowned in Sound the album kick started an underground punk scene. The album went on to be listed at 76 in the NME&#x27;s top one hundred list for the decade. In the same year Capdown played nearly 250 gigs.

In early 2001, Capdown toured with a number of established American bands, including Less Than Jake and played the Deconstruction touring festival with Pennywise and Lagwagon.

In September 2001, Capdown released their second album, &quot;Pound for the Sound&quot;, receiving positive reviews from &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. The following year saw tours with Bad Religion and Hundred Reasons. Capdown was featured in the 2002 BBC documentary Brassic Beats about the British ska punk scene.

In 2003 the band signed to Fierce Panda Records, releasing two EPs: &quot;Act Your Rage&quot; and &quot;New Revolutionaries&quot;. The former reached the 80th spot on the UK Singles Chart on 10 May 2003. As of November 2004, &quot;Civil Disobedients&quot; and &quot;Pound for the Sound&quot; have sold more than 30 thousand copies together.
The band received critical acclaim for their live performances. In 2006, Capdown played at the first Slam Dunk Festival.

The final line-up consisted of Jake Sims-Fielding (vocals and saxophone), Robin &quot;Boob&quot; Goold (bass guitar), Keith Minter (guitar and vocals), Tim Macdonald (drums) and a new addition, Andrew &quot;Eddie&quot; Hunt (keyboards/samples).

They released their final album on 5 February 2007, entitled &quot;Wind Up Toys&quot; on Fierce Panda Records.

The band split up after their final UK tour, which was due to be 9 November 2007, in their home town of Milton Keynes. However their &#x27;final show&#x27; took place on 7 June 2008, at the Pitz club in Milton Keynes, following a &#x27;warm up&#x27; at the Peel in Kingston upon Thames on 5 June 2008.

It was announced in 2010 that Capdown were to reform exclusively for the Slam Dunk Festival, held in London and Leeds on 29 and 30 May that year. However, the band also played at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool on 6 August 2011. In addition, they appeared at the Hevy Music Festival in Kent, between 5 and 8 August 2011 and at the Reading and Leeds Festival on 27–28 August 2011. In December 2014 the band played together with Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and The Skints on the Jägermeister Music Tour.

In May 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and September 2021, the band played at the Slam Dunk Festival in Leeds and Hatfield, United Kingdom.

==Other projects==
Following the original demise of Capdown, both Goold and Macdonald worked on a new band, The Maccalites, alongside Simon Wells from Snuff/Southport. Goold, Minter and Macdonald are also members of rock band This Contrast Kills.

Since 2012 Robin Goold and Tim Macdonald have been working on The GetGone with Ben Hyman, David Lloyd (1000 Hz) and Rob Blay. The band have released the 5 track &quot;Stories and Ruses&quot; EP in 2013, and their debut album &quot;One Thousand Ways To Live&quot; in April 2016. Both recorded and produced by Capdown&#x27;s Keith Minter.

As of 2013 Tim Macdonald has been playing drums in the UK Hardcore band Menshevik along with Steve Pitcher of Vanilla Pod, Dan Hawcroft previously of Whizzwood and Robert Dempsey of Mustard City Rockers.

<doc id="963273" wikidata="Q1055992" url="?curid=963273" title="Hounds of Love">
<text>Hounds of Love is the fifth studio album by the English musician Kate Bush, released on 16 September 1985 by EMI Records. It was a commercial and artistic success and marked a return to the public eye for Bush after the relatively low sales of her previous album, 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, became one of Bush&#x27;s biggest hits, giving Bush her second UK number-one single in June 2022. The album&#x27;s first side produced three further singles, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, and &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. The second side, subtitled &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, forms a conceptual suite about a woman drifting alone in the sea at night.

&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; received critical acclaim in both contemporary and retrospective reviews. It is considered by many fans and music critics to be Bush&#x27;s best album, and has been regularly voted one of the greatest albums of all time. It was Bush&#x27;s second album to top the UK Albums Chart, and in the US it reached the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is Bush&#x27;s best-selling studio album, having been certified double platinum for 600,000 sales in the UK, and by 1998 it had sold 1.1 million copies worldwide. The album was nominated at the 1986 Brit Awards for Best British Album, at which Bush was also nominated for Best British Female and Best British Single for &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. In 2022, the album re-entered various charts, including reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Alternative Albums, due to the appearance of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; in the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;.

==Background and recording==

In the summer of 1983, Bush began laying the groundwork for &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; at her home recording onto 8-track equipment, using a LinnDrum, Fairlight and piano. Wanting to retain the feel and atmosphere of these early recordings, she had them transferred to 24-track to build the final versions around once recording sessions officially began in November 1983. Following these sessions, as well as several recording sessions in Ireland during the spring of 1984, Bush began overdubbing and mixing the album in a process that took a year and the album was finished in June 1985. The recording sessions included use of the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, piano, traditional Irish instruments, and layered vocals. The chorale in &quot;Hello Earth&quot; is a segment from the traditional Georgian song &quot;Tsintskaro&quot;, performed by the Richard Hickox Singers. The lines &quot;It&#x27;s in the trees! It&#x27;s coming!&quot; from the beginning of the title track are sampled from a seance scene from the 1957 British horror film &quot;Night of the Demon&quot;, spoken by actor Maurice Denham.

The album was produced as two suites, with side one being subtitled &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and side two a seven-track concept piece subtitled &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;. The album has been described as post-progressive because Bush voices themes of love and womanly passion rather than the usual male viewpoints associated with progressive rock.

&quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; uses a great many textures to express the story: in the style of Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s Arthurian poems, Bush pursues a vision quest, taking the listener through a death and rebirth. The warmth of familiar sleep is cut by dangerous speed, ice and frigid water, an otherworldly trial and judgement, an out-of-body limbo, and finally a vigorous emergence and grounding in life energy. The disparate musical elements of &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; were described by Ron Moy as &quot;classically prog&quot; because of their evident experimentation, and because Bush wholly embraces European music traditions without a trace of American influence.

==Release and promotion==

On 5 August 1985, Bush performed the new single &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)&quot; on Terry Wogan&#x27;s BBC1 television chat show &quot;Wogan&quot;. The single entered the UK Singles Chart at number nine and ultimately peaked at number three, becoming Bush&#x27;s second-highest-charting single after her chart-topping debut single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The song is Bush&#x27;s only US top 40 hit, reaching number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1985.

A remix of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; with re-recorded vocals was broadcast during the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, with the song reaching number six on the UK Singles Chart.

In June 2022, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; reached the top of the UK charts giving Bush her second UK number one. The track also reached number one in eight other countries, and number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The album launch party was held at the London Planetarium on 5 September 1985. The invited guests were treated to a playback of the entire album while watching a laser show inside the Planetarium. &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was released on 16 September 1985 by EMI Records on vinyl, XDR cassette and compact disc formats. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, knocking Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984) from the top position. The album marked Bush&#x27;s breakthrough into the American charts with the Top 40 hit &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)&quot;. The album also yielded a set of music videos, one of which was &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, directed by Julian Doyle and co-starring Donald Sutherland. The video, like the song, was inspired by the life of psychologist Wilhelm Reich.

As a companion to the album, a 20-minute videotape and LaserDisc, &quot;The Hair of the Hound&quot;, containing music videos for the four singles, was released in 1986.

On 16 June 1997, a remastered version of the album was issued on CD as part of EMI&#x27;s &quot;First Centenary&quot; reissue series. The &quot;EMI First Centenary&quot; edition included six bonus tracks: 12″ mixes of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; and &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)&quot;, and the B-sides &quot;Under the Ivy&quot;, &quot;Burning Bridge&quot;, &quot;My Lagan Love&quot;, and &quot;Be Kind to My Mistakes&quot;, the last of which was written for Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Castaway&quot; and plays during the opening scene.

In 2010, Audio Fidelity reissued &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; on vinyl with new remastering by Steve Hoffman.

A 10&quot; pink vinyl record with four songs taken from the album (&quot;The Big Sky&quot;, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; and &quot;Jig of Life&quot;) was released by Audio Fidelity (catalogue number AFZEP 001) on 16 April 2011 for Record Store Day 2011, limited to 1000 copies worldwide.

During her 2014 Before the Dawn concerts, Bush performed almost the entire album live for the first time, with the exceptions of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; and &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot;. &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)&quot; had previously been performed live in 1987 with David Gilmour of Pink Floyd at the Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball.

In November 2018, Bush released box sets of remasters of her studio albums, including &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Most contemporary UK reviews were positive. In a five-star review, &quot;Sounds&quot; called the album &quot;dramatic, moving and wildly, unashamedly, beautifully romantic&quot;, before going on to state, &quot;If I were allowed to swear, I&#x27;d say that &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is f***ing brilliant, but me mum won&#x27;t let me&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; also gave the album five stars, stating that it &quot;recaptures the ground Kate lost with her last album&quot; and concluding, &quot;A howling success? I think so.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is definitely weird. It&#x27;s not an album for the suicidal or mums and dads. The violence of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; has turned into despair, confusion and fear – primarily of love, a subject that remains central to Bush&#x27;s songwriting.&quot; The review went on to scorn the idea that by signing to EMI Records as a teenager, Bush had allowed herself to be moulded in their corporate image, suggesting that on the contrary, it had enabled her to use the system for her own purposes: &quot;Our Kate&#x27;s a genius, the rarest solo artist this country&#x27;s ever produced. She makes sceptics dance to &quot;her&quot; tune. The company&#x27;s daughter has truly screwed the system and produced the best album of the year doing it.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was more reserved, saying, &quot;Here she has learned you can have control without sacrificing passion and it&#x27;s the heavyweight rhythm department aided and abetted by some overly fussy arrangements that get the better of her&quot;. Of &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; suite on the second side of the record, NME felt &quot;she makes huge demands on her listener and the theme is too confused and the execution too laborious and stilted to carry real weight as a complete entity&quot;.

In the US, reaction to the record was mixed. Awarding the record the title of &quot;platter du jour&quot; (i.e. album of the day), &quot;Spin&quot; observed that &quot;with traces of classical, operatic, tribal and twisted pop styles, Kate creates music that observes no boundaries of musical structure or inner expression&quot;. The review noted &quot;while her eclecticism is welcomed and rewarded in her homeland her genius is still ignored here – a situation that is truly a shame for an artist so adventurous and naturally theatrical&quot;, and hoped that &quot;this album might gain her some well-deserved recognition from the American mainstream&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in their first review of a Kate Bush record, was unimpressed: &quot;The Mistress of Mysticism has woven another album that both dazzles and bores. Like the Beatles on their later albums, Bush is not concerned about having to perform the music live, and her orchestrations swell to the limits of technology. But unlike the Beatles, Bush often overdecorates her songs with exotica ... There&#x27;s no arguing that Bush is extraordinarily talented, but as with Jonathan Richman, rock&#x27;s other eternal kid, her vision will seem silly to those who believe children should be seen and not heard.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterised the album&#x27;s music as &quot;slightly precious, calculated female art rock&quot; and called Bush &quot;a real master of instrumental textures.&quot;

In retrospective reviews, &quot;The Independent&quot; called &quot;Hounds&quot; &quot;a prog-pop masque of an album&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a perfect score, noting that the album draws from synth-pop and progressive rock whilst remaining wholly distinct from either style. &quot;Spin&quot; called it an &quot;art-pop classic&quot;.

===Accolades===
In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; at number 68 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; included the album at number four on their list of The 200 Best Albums of the 1980s.

In a poll of the public conducted by NPR, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was voted in fourth place in its list of 150 greatest albums ever made by female artists.

The album was placed at number 10 in the &quot;NME&quot; critics&#x27; list of the best albums of 1985.

In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; the 48th-greatest album of all time, while two years later the same magazine placed it at number 20 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;, and the third &quot;Greatest Album of All-Time by a Female Artist&quot; in 2002. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; placed the album at number four in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In January 2006, &quot;NME&quot; named it the 41st-best British album of all time. The 19th edition of &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;, published by Guinness in May 2006, included a list of the Top 100 albums of all time, as voted by readers of the book and &quot;NME&quot; readers, which placed &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; at number 70. In 2008, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; said the album should be given consideration when listing albums released between 1978 and 1988 that have stood the test of time while remaining influential and enjoyable to this day. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 10 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; 48th on its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list. In 2024, &quot;Apple Music&quot; placed the album at number 50 on its &quot;Apple Music 100 Best Albums&quot; list.

==Comments from other musicians==
&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was described as &quot;one of the big inspirations&quot; for Alison Goldfrapp of Goldfrapp. Suede lead singer Brett Anderson said of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;: &quot;I love the way it&#x27;s a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It&#x27;s an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring&quot;. Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac named &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; as one of her favorite albums. Kele Okereke of Bloc Party said of the title track: &quot;The first time I heard it I was sitting in a reclining sofa. As the beat started I was transported somewhere else. Her voice, the imagery, the huge drum sound: it seemed to capture everything for me. As a songwriter you&#x27;re constantly chasing that feeling&quot;.

<text>The Central Applications Office (CAO) () is the organisation responsible for overseeing undergraduate applications to colleges and universities in the Republic of Ireland.

The primary mission of the Central Applications Office is to centrally process applications in a fair and efficient manner. The colleges and universities delegate the administration of admissions to the Central Applications Office; colleges and universities retain full control of admissions.

The Postgraduate Applications Centre is a related organisation that oversees some taught postgraduate courses.

==History==

The &quot;Central Applications Office&quot; was founded in January 1976 based in Galway, with nine colleges and universities participating initially. The first students processed through the system commenced courses in 1978.

The &quot;Central Admissions Service&quot; (CAS) was introduced independently by the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Regional Technical Colleges, both of whom were outside the initial Central Applications Office.

Commencing in the 1991 intake the Central Applications Office and Central Admissions Service decided to combine their admissions procedures so that students would have to complete only one joint application form for both systems - the &quot;CAO/CAS&quot;. The common points scale came into operation the next year, with the best six results from one sitting of the Leaving Certificate becoming the standard; previous to that there had been some allowance to accumulate points by sitting the Leaving Certificate more than once. Also the combined system was taken as an opportunity to reduce non-standard applications such as interviews for selection and portfolios of work - and overall to simplify the applications process. Eventually the CAS was subsumed into the CAO.

==Background==

Students applying for admission to third level education courses in Ireland apply to the CAO rather than to individual educational institutions such as colleges and universities. The CAO then offers places to students who meet the minimum requirements for a course for which they have applied. If for a particular course there are more qualified applicants than available places, the CAO makes offers to those applicants with the highest score in the CAO points system. If students do not accepts offers, or later decline them because they receive an offer for another course, the CAO makes further offers until all of the places have been filled or until the offer season closes.

=== Outside the points system ===

The points system is designed for young people leaving secondary education. Many institutions reserve places in some courses for older adults, people from disadvantaged backgrounds, or other groups unlikely to achieve a place through the points system. Applications for most of these are routed through the CAO, but processed manually by the individual institutions rather than automatically via the points system.

== The points system ==


The CAO awards points to students based on their achievements in the Leaving Certificate examination. A student&#x27;s points are calculated according to these tables, counting their best six subjects only (resulting in a maximum score of 625 points since 2012 with the introduction of the extra 25 points awarded to those who sit the honours mathematics exam and pass). If a student has sat the Leaving Certificate examination on more than one occasion, their points are calculated according to their best year&#x27;s performance. Students&#x27; points are used as a queuing system for over-subscribed courses, with the available places offered to those students ranked highest by the points scale.

Points can also be scored for results in other examinations, such as UK A levels. A level points for Universities, associated colleges and DIT are scored on the basis of the best four A levels or three A levels and an AS level in a different subject from the same or preceding year. From 2016 CAO point allocation for these exams is: A* (180), A (150), B (130), C (100), D (65) and E (45) for the first 3 A-Levels and A* (60), A (50), B (45), C (35), D (20) and E (15) for a fourth A Level. If using an AS Level as the fourth subject points are allocated as follows: A (30), B (25), C (20), D (15) and E (10)

In the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, students may obtain a Distinction (66 points), Merit (46 points), or Pass (28 points) that can be used as well as their 6 best subjects.

<doc id="963286" wikidata="Q519717" url="?curid=963286" title="Mazzorbo">
<text>Mazzorbo is one of various islands in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice. Like the other islands in this part of the lagoon, it was the site of one of the earliest settlements in the lagoon which predated the development of Venice. However, these islands then declined and were eventually abandoned. In the 1980s the architect Giancarlo De Carlo built a brightly coloured residential neighbourhood to help to repopulate Mazzorbo. In 2019 its population was 256. It is linked to Burano by a wooden bridge. It was once an important trading centre but is now known for its vineyards and orchards. Its main attraction is the fourteenth century church of Santa Caterina.

==Geography==
Mazzorbo is situated next to the island of Burano, to its north, to which it is linked by a bridge, and to the west of the island of Torcello. It lies to the north of the palude di Santa Caterina marsh and to the west of the palude del Monte marsh. The canals around the island are the Canale Borgogni and Canale di Burano channels to the west, the Canale Scomerzera di Mazzorbo channel (the western end of which separates it from Burano) to the south, the Canale Santa Caterina channel (which separates it from the Santa Caterina island) to the east and the Canale di Mazzorbo channel to the north. The latter separates Mazzorbo from the larger Mazzorbetto island. Mazzorbo is linked to the island of Murano and the central part of the lagoon by the Canale Scomenzera di San Giacomo canal.

Mazzorbo is part of a group of four islands. To its west there is the island of Santa Caterina to which Mazzorbo is separated by the Santa Caterina channel. The two islands are connected by two bridges. The Santa Caterina island was split into two in 1928 when an extension of the Canale di Mazzorbo channel (the Santa Margherita canal) was dug to connect Mazzorbo’s northern shore to the Canale Scomerzera San Giacomo canal. To the north there is Mazzorbetto, which is separated by the some-60 m wide Canale di Mazzorbo channel. Although in Italian Mazzorbetto sounds like “little Mazzorbo,” it is the largest island of the group.

==Etymology==
In the past Mazzorbo was variously called Maioribus or Maiorbo (1137), Maiorbenses (1143) or Maiurbo (1228).

Jacopo Filiasi, a late 18th/early 19th century historian, argued that the origin of the name Mazzorbo was the Latin term &quot;Major Urbs&quot;, &quot;Major Urbi&quot;, and Majurbium, Great or Major Town, and that this settlement was the largest town in the whole of Byzantine Venezia Marittima, the coastal area of north-eastern Italy which was under the Byzantines in the 6th century. However, the work of many historians, including Roberto Cessi, has shown that Mazzorbo was never mentioned in the ancient and medieval chronicles. Therefore, this hypothesis seems unlikely. It has been suggested that Filiasi’s interpretation came in the context of the patriotic and aggrandising panegyric typical of 19th century Venice and anti-Austrian rhetoric during the Austrian occupation.

In the basis of the lack of mentions of Mazzorbo in the old chronicles, Cristoforo Tentori Spagnuolo, another late 18th/early 19th century historian, argued that the origin of the name Mazzorbo was &quot;Medium Urbis&quot;, ”Town in Between” or “Town in the Middle” (of other towns).

A Roman stone inscription which was discovered in the 19th century, the Epigrafe Torcellana (Torcello Epigraph), commemorates a donation to the town of Altinum by Tiberius Claudius Nero who, during his consulate (13-14 BCE) built temples, porticoes and gardens. It describes the town, its districts and gates and mentions the &quot;Maedium Urbis&quot; gate. The inscription was placed on this gate, which was in the northeast of the town. This name also appears in other sources, where it is sometimes written as &quot;Medium Urbium&quot; or &quot;Mediurbium&quot;. This was also the name of the sixth district of the town. According to Simone Menegaldo, the refugees from Altinum gave this name to this island because it was in between other islands they settled (Burano, Torcello, and Costanziaco).

==History==
It is often held that the settlements in Mazzorbo and the other islands in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice were built by refugees from the nearby coastal town of Altinum either when it was destroyed by Attila of the Huns in 452 or from the inland areas of the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions when they were conquered by the Lombards in 569-615. However, in 1881, archaeologists discovered Mycenaean pottery on the island, which shows that there was already commercial activity in 1600–1100 BCE.

Like the settlements on other islands of the northern part of the lagoon (Torcello, Costanziaco, Ammiana and Burano) Mazzorbo was one of the earliest settlement in the Lagoon which predated the development of Venice. These settlements thrived from the 9th to the 14th century when they were the hub of maritime trade with the Adriatic Sea and the rest of the Mediterranean Sea. Flaminio Corner, an 18th century historian, wrote that &quot;[the island of Mazzorbo] is divided into two by a wide canal which flows in the middle and separates the island into a western and eastern part, it lies among other islands, a long time ago it was a breathing space of the Nobles, when they were dedicated to a fruitful maritime trade.&quot;

Mazzorbo and the other islands in the area declined with the urbanisation of Rivoalto, which developed into the city of Venice and became the dominant centre of the lagoon. Many families moved to Venice. In addition, there was environmental degradation caused by floods which eroded the banks of the islands and various buildings, the expansion of the surrounding marshes and problems with malaria. Eventually, Mazzorbo and other islands in the area were abandoned.

With the depopulation of this part of the Lagoon of Venice, many religious institutions were established on these islands. Despite not being a large settlement, Mazzorbo had five monasteries and five parish churches. The monasteries were Santa Eufemia (which was dissolved and demolished in 1768), San Maffio (which was dissolved and demolished during Napoleon&#x27;s occupation of Venice and its lagoon), Santa Maria Valverde, Santa Maria delle Grazie and Santa Caterina. The parish churches were: San Pietro, San Bartolomeo (which was demolished in 1810 during the Napoleonic occupation), San Angelo, Santo Stefano and Santi Cosma e Damiano. With the decline of the island and with the dissolution of churches and monasteries, all of these churches and monasteries, except for the Santa Caterina church, were demolished and no trace of them remains.

The above mentioned names (Maioribus, Maiorbo and Maiurbo) referred to a settlement which comprised all of the three-island group (prior to the splitting of the S. Caterina island in 1928). In fact, the San Matteo monastery was on the Santa Caterina island. The Sant&#x27; Eufemia monastery was in the southeast of the Mazzorbetto island, along the Canale di Mazzorbo channel and with its entrance facing the Canale Bognoni channel which leads to Torcello. The San Pietro church was at the southwestern end of Mazzorbetto.

Not much is known about the life and the politics of Mazzorbo before its abandonment. There are only archival documents which mainly record information about its religious institutions. The monasteries also provided for the education of young noble women. Through this connection with the nobility, the churches and monasteries of Mazzorbo were endowed with artworks by painters and other artists who were renown at the time.

==Disappeared churches and monasteries==
===San Pietro Parish Church===
The only archival document relating to the parish church of San Pietro is dated to 1207. It was probably Mazzorbo’s main church. The date of its construction is not known. It seems that it was built with materials from Altinum and thus could be dated to the 7th-8th century. Tradition notes its beauty and the marble columns of its portico and claims that St. Francis and St. Antony preached here. Over the main altar there was a panel with “St. Peter and St. Paul” by Pietro Ricchi and over the St. Margaret altar there was the &quot;Madonna, St. Bartholomew and St. Margaret&quot; panel by Francesco Ruschi.

There was a gilded silver altarpiece which was probably kept in the main altar and then, as noted in a 1681 pastoral visit by the bishop of Torcello, was put at the bottom of a large crucifix in front of the main chapel which shared the nave of the presbytery with an iconostasis with the twelve apostles. It was probably the type of 12th century Venetian goldsmith work inspired by Byzantine iconographic elements. It was made of gilded silver tiles nailed to wooden panels with sacred images which represented the Madonna, the Saints and Christ the Saviour.

From the 14th century, Mazzorbo underwent a period of slow decline and became depopulated. San Pietro became impoverished. In 1736, Ferrazzi, a parish priest, complained about having to resort to act as a chaplain for the St. Matthew nuns to get some money because donations to the church were not enough to get by despite getting an annual income from two secular confraternities. With the dissolution of churches and monasteries ordered during Napoleon&#x27;s occupation of Venice the derelict church was demolished. Now there is only a plot of land which belongs to the current parish church of Santa Caterina. The precious altarpiece was lost.

===San Bartolomeo Parish Church===
In the eastern part of Mazzorbo there was another very old parish church. It was dedicated to St. Bartholomew There are no documents regarding its foundation. Flaminio Corner wrote that it was dissolved in the 17th century because it was no longer able to sustain itself and was merged with the San Pietro parish church. It was replaced by an oratory at the edge of the parish. In 1775 the bishop of Torcello described it as an oratory with a chaplain. Zanetti noted that there was a &quot;Saint Bernard&quot; panel by Antonio Zanchi. The oratory was demolished in 1830. A document in the Mazzorbo parish archive it is noted that the materials from its demolition fetched 203 liras.

===San Matteo Monastery===
In 1218 the bishop of Torcello donated a very old church dedicated to St Mathew to three Benedictine nuns on the island of Costanziaco. This island became uninhabitable due to environmental degradation caused by floods breaking the banks of the island and damaging buildings and malaria. The nuns were moved to Mazzorbo, on the Santa Caterina island, opposite the San Pietro church, on the other side of the canal. Construction of the new monastery begun in 1298.

There were disputes in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1341 the nuns asked to be put under the jurisdiction of the abbot of Piacenza due to disagreements with their superior. The Patriarchs of Constantinople and of Grado were drawn into the dispute. This was resolved by Pope Paul II (1464–71) who had the nuns to submit to the Patriarch of Venice in 1464. In 1521, during the pontificate of Leo X (1513–21), the 50 nuns of S. Matteo were sent to join the 5 nuns of the old Benedictine Monastery of Santa Margherita on the island of Torcello due to minor disciplinary transgressions.

In 1806, during the Napoleonic dissolution of Venetian churches and monasteries, S. Matteo was demolished, too. There were many paintings and sculptures in this monastery; 92 paintings and 12 terracotta and wooden sculptures were catalogued. They all have been lost. The Santa Margherita canal (see above) was dug for a better connection between the Scomerzera San Giacomo and Mazzorbo canals on the grounds of this monastery a century later. It was opened in 1928.

In the convent’s church there were four panels by Matteo Ingoli: “St Helen kneeling with the cross with four putti in the air”, “The visit of St. Elizabeth”, &quot;St. Jerome, St. Charles and a blessed abbess” and &quot;St. Margaret and her ascent.” Above the main altar there was a panel with various saints, a nun and the map of the monastery attributed by Boschini, an art critic, to the Vivarini schools. Modern art historians instead attribute it to Giovanni Mansueti. Today it is kept in Venetian collection of the heirs of the painter Italico Brass.

===Santa Eufemia Monastery=== 
Bernardino Scardeonio’s History of Paduan Antiquity tells that Margherita, a Padua noblewoman, withdrew to Mazzorbo with three noble maidens and founded this monastery. It also records that in 1439 the bishop of Torcello sent the Benedictine nuns of the Sant Angelo monastery on the island of Ammiana, whose numbers had been reduced to three due to environmental degradation and depopulation in that island, to the monastery. In 1768 the senate of the Republic of Venice dissolved the monastery and its church. The buildings were used for military purposes. In the early 19th century a fort was built here. There is no trace of it left.

In Murano there is a well curb which used to be in the courtyard of the monastery. It has this inscription: “IN TEMPO DELLA R.M. SUOR SCOLASTICA PISANI DIG.MA ABBAD. / PUTEUS ACQUAR VIVENTIUMQUAE / FLUUNT IMPETU DE LIBANO / MDLXXXVIII DIE X DECEM”

==Santa Caterina, the only surviving church==
This the only surviving church in Mazzorbo. According to a 1715 chronicle by Bernardo Trevisan, a Venetian nobleman, Santa Caterina was built in 783. It was rebuilt between 1283 and 1291 and annexed to a Benedictine nun convent with the same name. The convent was behind the church. It was demolished in 1806 during the Napoleonic dissolution of monasteries. The church was tuned into a parish church. By then it had been in decline. In 1819 it became the only parish church in Mazzorbo. Major restoration work in 1920-25 altered the original structure. Restoration work in 2002 re-established the original bricked wall.

Its earliest mention is in the acts of a parish synod convened by the bishop of Torcello in 1374. The oldest archival document is a 1398 pledge of loyalty to the bishop of Torcello by the abbess. In the 14th century the nuns experienced hardship. In 1314 the Murano chapter granted them a marsh so that they could benefit from the revenues of its mills. However, this income was not enough, and the number of nuns decreased. In 1432 the revenues of the monastery of Santa Maria della Gaiada on the Tumba della Gaiada island (which was part of the settlement of Ammiana) were incorporated into those of Santa Caterina. In 1492 the dissolved Benedictine monastery of San Nicolo was merged with Santa Caterina.

The complex was restored in 1712 by Pietro Tabacco, a nobleman who in the same period founded the Madonna del Rosario church on the Madonna del Monte island, towards Murano. To provide further aid, the Bishop of Torcello merged Santa Caterina with Santa Maria della Gaiada monastery, which had been abandoned.

The church has a unique aisle with a ceiling which resembles the hull of a ship dating to the 15th century. There are several paintings. The most important are the “Mystical wedding of Saint Katherine” by Matteo Ponzone and one by Giuseppe Porta. Above the entrance door there is a sculptured marble lunette with the “Mystical wedding of Saint Katherine and two Donors.” Christ is sitting on a throne holding an open book which reads “EGO SUM LUS MUNDI” in his left hand. With his right hand he puts a ring on the finger of a kneeling St. Katherine. The bell tower was built in the 14th century and has the oldest bell in the lagoon. It dates to 1318.

==Mazzorbo today== 
Mazzorbo today is a sparsely populated island devoted mainly to agriculture with vegetable growing, vineyards and orchards. Mazzorbetto and Santa Caterina are also devoted to agriculture. In the latter two there are several farmsteads and hardly any inhabitants.

At the eastern end of Mazzorbo, by the bridge which connects it to Burano, there is the Scarpa farm. It has a number of buildings, some of which date to the 16th century, vineyards, fruit trees and vegetable areas which are surrounded by a 19th century wall. It was bought by Venice council in 1999 and after it was restored in 2006 it was opened to the public. It has information about the history of local agriculture. The Dordona grape is grown here. This is a fine grape which is native of the lagoon and has been recently been selected from centuries-old vines.

Giancarlo De Carlo was an architect who belonged to a new generation of architects who wanted to develop a new type of architecture, one which was better suited to local social and environmental conditions and where man &quot;is not reduced to an abstract figure&quot;. He theorized a more democratic and open &quot;participatory architecture&quot;. In 1979 he built a brightly painted housing neighbourhood to help to repopulate the island.

<text>Monster Party is a video game for the NES, released in North America in 1989 by Bandai. It was and remains a relatively obscure platform game for the console, having a small following among some players. The game both pays homage to and parodies horror pop culture, alternately featuring enemies and locations based on classic horror icons, and parodic reinterpretations.

In the 2000s the game became infamous in online gaming circles when prototype screenshots of a Japanese Famicom version known as began circulating showing different bosses and parodies. No version of the game was ever released in Japan. In May 2011, a prototype of the canceled Japanese release was listed on Yahoo! Japan auctions, closing at a high price of ¥483000 (approximately $6,000 USD). In July 2014, the unreleased Japanese Famicom version was leaked online.

== Story ==
The story centers on a child named Mark (originally known as Hiroshi (ひろし) in the unreleased Japanese prototype) who, on his way home from a baseball game, is approached by a winged, griffin-like alien named Bert (originally known as Value (バリュー) in the unreleased Japanese prototype) who seeks assistance in ridding &quot;evil monsters&quot; from his realm, &quot;Dark World&quot;. Being the first person he encounters, Bert tries to enlist Mark as his aid in battle. Mark is reluctant to help, but Bert explains that anyone will do, and that Mark&#x27;s baseball bat will be as good a weapon as any. Bert quickly whisks him away, and on the way to Dark World magically fuses himself to Mark so that they are one being (with Mark able to transform into Bert for a limited time).

The bizarre premise and plot introduction sets up a game that is filled with variations on many traditional horror characters and themes (sometimes with ironic twists), as well as relatively novel characters all its own. Some traditional horror bosses the game features include a mummy, giant spiders, zombies, Medusa, a Dragon, and The Grim Reaper. The game also features several enemies drawn from Japanese folklore and Japanese urban legends, such as Banchō Sarayashiki&#x27;s well and Jinmenken (human faced dogs). Enemies unique to the game include a large, talking caterpillar; walking pants; a giant cat that hurls kittens as projectiles; and a bouncing piece of fried shrimp.

After making his way through Dark World and ascending into what appears to be some kind of Heavenly realm, Mark fights and defeats the Dark World Master. His realm now free of monsters, Bert returns Mark home and leaves him with a parting gift for his help. When Mark opens the box, a beautiful princess emerges; after a few seconds, though, she transforms into a hideous monster accompanied by a few monsters who melts Mark&#x27;s flesh from his bones.

Mark suddenly awakens in his bed, his body intact. Believing his adventures in the Dark World were a dream, he prepares to leave the house to school, only to find Bert standing before the front door with Mark&#x27;s bat. Bert asks Mark if he is ready to go again, and the game ends.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes the role of Mark, who wields his bat to attack and to deflect projectiles. Rebounding projectiles back at bosses is often necessary to defeat them as Mark has limited attack options. Enemies drop hearts, which replenish life, as well as pills which (for a small period of time) turn Mark into Bert, who can fly and shoot beams at a limited distance. The effect of Bert&#x27;s beams on enemies is stronger than Mark&#x27;s bat attack, and gradually improves as the player completes levels.

&quot;Monster Party&quot; features eight levels, each of which has a unique password that allows the player to access a particular level without starting the entire game over. The basic objective in each level is to beat particular bosses (and a certain number of them) to earn a key and move on to the next level. Bosses are accessed by doorways found in the main part of the level, which is side-scrolling, but many of these doors lead to empty rooms, adding challenge. Every door, whether it leads to nothing or a level boss, gives the player a question mark (&#x27;?&#x27;) item, which can either provide the player with health, points, or the transformation into Bert.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Monster Party&quot; is infamous in the retro gaming community for prototype images released in Japan before the game&#x27;s release in the US. The images reveal a different original concept for the game that was much darker and more graphically complex than the version eventually released.
Originally, the title screen was to be covered in blood, and the enemies designed to look much more horrific than in the final game. The first level&#x27;s setting, presently an abstract black-and-pink pattern, was originally an elaborately drawn mountain range at sunset. Other changes revealed by these images is a change to the first boss, a large plant, which was shown to have a microphone and speaker in the original, a possible reference to Little Shop of Horrors.

The game is remembered for its bizarre premise by both fans and critics alike. The horror content that was permitted to remain in the game—notably large amounts of blood and the use of the word &quot;hell&quot;—have puzzled gamers, as Nintendo was notorious for enforcing censorship policies in the late 1980s and early 90s, when the game was released.

In the latter 2000s, following the release of prototype images, gamers realized that an invisible platform inside the man eating plant&#x27;s chamber was in fact the &quot;deleted&quot; speaker system, and that programmers had simply covered the sprite in black pixels rather than outright remove it. This led to the establishment of a restoration project, in which gamers began searching through the game&#x27;s source code in attempt to discover if other &quot;deleted&quot; content had in fact remained on the cartridge, and reinsert it into a &quot;restored&quot; version of the game. The project was completed in 2013. Amongst discoveries made by those working on the project was the revelation that many of the game&#x27;s more incongruous bosses may have originated as copyrighted characters that had to be altered for the game to be released in the United States: the pumpkin ghost with the spinning head was originally an ape from &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, while the giant cat inside of the box seems to have originally been one of the Gremlins, and finally the grim reaper was originally a robot resembling a Xenomorph from the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise.

<doc id="963301" wikidata="Q1691401" url="?curid=963301" title="Joe Dirt">
<text>Joe Dirt is a 2001 American adventure comedy film, directed by Dennie Gordon (in her feature film directorial debut), starring David Spade, Dennis Miller, Christopher Walken, Adam Beach, Brian Thompson, Brittany Daniel, Jaime Pressly, Erik Per Sullivan, and Kid Rock. The film was written by Spade and Fred Wolf, and produced by Robert Simonds. The plot revolves around a poor young man, Joe Dirt, who at first seems to be a loser. As he travels in search of his parents, his finer qualities are increasingly revealed. He ends up with a new family of close friends, people he has helped and who respect him. While critical reception was mostly negative, the film was a modest financial success, eventually becoming a cult favorite. A sequel, &quot;Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser&quot;, premiered on Crackle on July 16, 2015.

==Plot==

Joe Dirt, a janitor at a Los Angeles radio station, tells his life story via shock jock Zander Kelly&#x27;s broadcast. Joe reveals that as a baby he had a mullet wig installed because the top of his skull had never formed. At age 8, he was left behind by his parents and sister at the Grand Canyon and thus does not know his real surname. After growing up in a series of foster homes, Joe ran away until he arrived in Silvertown, a small chicken town in the Pacific Northwest. There, he met Brandy and her dog, Charlie, and became a target of jealousy from Robby, the town bully. After Brandy&#x27;s alcoholic father shoots Charlie dead, Joe decides to try to find his parents.

He details his adventures across the country including his friendship with Kickin&#x27; Wing, an unsuccessful Native American fireworks salesman. In Indiana, Joe has an encounter with a serial killer named Buffalo Bob, who is parodying the lotion scene from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. This brings him unwanted attention from the media but helps his search.

In Louisiana at a high school, he was a janitor working with Clem Doore, a former mobster in the Witness Protection Program. Clem rescues students after a mustard gas explosion and informs the media Joe was the hero. While traveling on further he came across an alligator farm and met the owner, Charlene. Looking to make money, he was hired to be an alligator wrangler for audiences. After one encounter with an alligator in which he landed wrong, he had an epiphany about his little sister yelling at Joe about why his last name was Dirt and not his real surname Nunamaker. Upon realizing his real last name, Joe discovers the address of his old family home and he travels to Baton Rouge, only to find that they moved away many years prior. Listening to Joe&#x27;s story, both Zander and the radio audience initially find him an object of scorn, but Joe&#x27;s kindness and optimistic outlook on life win them over.

Eventually, Joe lands the janitorial job at the radio station, where he recounts how he gave up the search and returned to Silvertown to be with Brandy. However, Robby informed him that he and Brandy were getting married and that she found Joe&#x27;s parents but instructed him not to tell Joe. Zander calls Brandy to find out why, and she tells Joe his parents were killed the day they were at the Grand Canyon; she pleads with Joe to return to Silvertown. Upset by the news, Joe stays in Los Angeles.

Joe is unaware that he has become a media sensation, but he quickly discovers his newfound fame. An appearance on &quot;TRL&quot; results in a phone call from a woman claiming to be Joe&#x27;s mother. Joe meets his parents, and he discovers that they intentionally abandoned him and that they only reconnected with him to boost their sales of clown figurines. Joe storms out, cutting ties with his parents. He intends to commit suicide, but Brandy arrives and finally admits that she lied to him about his parents being dead because she had to protect him from them and their greed after she found out what horrible people they were. Brandy expresses her love and convinces Joe to come home with her, but he suffers a head injury after a police officer lassos and accidentally causes him to fall off a bridge hitting his head while springing back up.

Joe wakes up in Brandy&#x27;s house, surrounded by his friends: Kickin&#x27; Wing, who reveals that thanks to Joe he now owns 30 successful firework stands, Clem (who is now under the name of Gert B. Frobe) and Charlene (now without a thumb and middle finger on her left hand), who are now engaged. Brandy reveals that she got Joe a dreadlock wig following his head operation, has retrieved his Hemi, and she has a new dog that Charlie fathered. As they prepare to take a ride in Joe&#x27;s Hemi, Robby arrives and tells Joe that no one wants him in Silvertown. Clem threatens Robby and exclaims that they are Joe&#x27;s family. Robby challenges Joe to a race and Joe leaves him in the dust as Robby&#x27;s car malfunctions and breaks down. As they drive away, Zander dedicates a song to Joe on the radio.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Joe Dirt&quot; opened at #4 in the domestic box office with $8,016,008 and went on to gross $27,087,695 domestically and $3,900,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $30,987,695; from an estimated $17.7 million budget; this can be considered a moderate success.

===Critical response===
On Metacritic &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; has a rating of 20/100 based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 9% rating based on 76 reviews with an average rating of 3.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;If you fall within the target audience of &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;, you may find it funny. Otherwise, the jokes will seem like a tired retread.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B−. Ebert and Roeper both gave the film a thumbs down. Richard Roeper criticized the film for being too predictable and strained, and said that the radio station storyline was &quot;absurd&quot;. Roger Ebert agreed, but praised Spade for taking on a different role than he is normally associated with, and added that Spade&#x27;s performance was convincing, despite the film&#x27;s other shortcomings. Ebert included &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; as one of his most hated films of all time under the category of &quot;alleged comedies,&quot; stating that, &quot;What movies, including &quot;Joe Dirt,&quot; often do not understand is that the act of being buried in crap is not in and of itself funny.&quot;

==Cancelled TV series==
In early 2010, Spade worked on a pilot with TBS for an animated series based on the film. The series never materialized.

==Sequel==

In 2014, Spade revealed in a Reddit question that he was writing a sequel to &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; for Crackle. Entertainment Weekly has noted that the film is &quot;the first ever made-for-digital sequel&quot;. Filming on the sequel began on November 17, 2014, with David Spade posting a first look at Joe Dirt on his Instagram. The film was released in July 2015 and received similarly negative reviews.
