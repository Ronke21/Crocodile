<text>DOSBox is a free and open-source emulator which runs software for MS-DOS compatible disk operating systems—primarily video games. It was first released in 2002, when DOS technology was becoming obsolete. Its adoption for running DOS games is widespread, with it being used in commercial re-releases of those games as well.

==Development==
Before Windows XP, consumer-oriented versions of Windows were based on MS-DOS. Windows 3.0 and its updates were operating environments that ran on top of MS-DOS, and the Windows 9x series consisted of operating systems that were still based on MS-DOS. These versions of Windows could run DOS applications. Conversely, the Windows NT operating systems were not based on DOS. A member of the series, Windows XP, debuted on October 25, 2001, and became the first consumer-oriented version of Windows to not use DOS. Although Windows XP could emulate DOS, it could not run many of its applications as they ran only in real mode to directly access the computer&#x27;s hardware, and Windows XP&#x27;s protected mode prevented such direct access for security reasons. MS-DOS continued to receive support until the end of 2001, and all support for any DOS-based Windows operating system ended on July 11, 2006.

The development of DOSBox began around the launch of Windows 2000—a Windows NT system—when its creators, Dutch programmers Peter Veenstra and Sjoerd van der Berg, discovered that the operating system had dropped much of its support for DOS software. The two knew of solutions at the time, but they could not run the applications in windowed mode or scale the graphics. The project was first uploaded to SourceForge and released for beta testing on July 22, 2002.

DOSBox is a command-line program, configured either by a set of command-line arguments or by editing a plain text configuration file. For ease of use, several graphical front ends have been developed by the user community.

While the DOSBox project hopes that one day the emulator will run all programs ever made for the PC, the goal is not yet reached, and as of the latest version the primary focus has been on DOS gaming. The basic version does not support long filenames, most versions of DOS do not support them, and filenames must follow the 8.3 name.extension pattern: a maximum of 8 characters for the name and up to 3 characters for the extension. Otherwise, filenames will be altered to fit the pattern.

There are versions available on the DOSBox website that support long filenames, at the cost of possible incompatibility with some older programs.
The focus of the vanilla version is on gaming, and features such as support for Ctrl-Break may be missing. Some of the alternative versions support features not present in the vanilla version such as APM power off, direct parallel port passthrough for printing, and support for East Asian characters. 
Because DOSBox accesses the host computer&#x27;s file system, there thus is a risk of DOS malware exploiting the emulator&#x27;s security vulnerabilities and causing damage to the host machine, although these vulnerabilities continue to be patched with new DOSBox updates.

Users can also capture screenshots and record videos of DOS sessions, although a codec is required to play the videos. It is also possible to record OPL sound card and MIDI commands, as well as save sound output on a WAV file. Keyboard keys and the buttons of a game controller can be mapped to other keys and combinations thereof.

===OS emulation===
DOSBox is a full-system emulator that provides BIOS interrupts and contains its own internal DOS-like shell. This means that it can be used without owning a license to any real DOS operating system. Most commands that are found in COMMAND.COM are supported, but many of the more advanced commands found in the latest MS-DOS versions are not. In addition to its internal shell, it also supports running image files of games and software originally intended to start without any operating system. Besides emulating DOS, users can also run Windows 3.0 and applications designed for it, as well as versions of Windows within the Windows 9x family.

When the DOSBox application is opened, it automatically mounts to a virtual, permanent codice_1 drive that stores DOSBox commands and utilities. The reasons for the virtual drive are related to security, but the user can mount a different drive letter in the emulator to a directory, image file, floppy disk drive, or CD-ROM drive on the host to access its data. A configuration file and its AUTOEXEC section can be used to respectively configure DOSBox settings and execute DOS commands at startup.

===Hardware emulation===
DOSBox is capable of running DOS programs that require the CPU to be in real mode or protected mode. Since DOSBox can emulate its CPU by interpretation, the environment it emulates is completely independent of the host CPU. On systems which provide the x86, ARM, or other RISC instruction sets, however, DOSBox can use dynamic instruction translation to accelerate execution. The emulated CPU speed of DOSBox is also manually adjustable by the user to accommodate the speed of the systems for which DOS programs were originally written.

DOSBox uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer external library to handle graphics, audio, and input devices. Graphically, it can use the DirectDraw or OpenGL APIs, and can also use bilinear interpolation and scale graphics for computers with modern displays. Graphical emulation includes text mode, Hercules, CGA, EGA, VGA, VESA, S3 Trio 64, and Tandy. Sound emulation includes the PC speaker, AdLib, Gravis Ultrasound, Sound Blaster, Disney Sound Source, Tandy, and MPU-401. However, because DOSBox does not come packaged with Gravis Ultrasound drivers, they need to be installed separately for full support.

DOSBox can simulate serial null modems using the TCP/IP protocol and IPX network tunneling, which allows for DOS multiplayer games using one of them to be played over local area networks or the Internet. It can also simulate the PC joystick port, with limited options being to emulate one joystick with four axes and four buttons; one gamepad with two axes and six buttons; two joysticks each with two axes and two buttons; a Thrustmaster Flight Control System joystick that has three axes, four buttons, and a hat switch; and a CH Flightstick with four axes, six buttons that can be pressed only one at a time, and a hat switch. Newer joysticks and gamepads will need to use one of these configurations to function.

==Reception==
DOSBox has become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for running DOS games. &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; positively remarked on the project&#x27;s continual reception of updates, its influence on PC gaming, and some front ends designed to facilitate using it. Freelance writer Michael Reed lauded the quality of scaled graphics and the project&#x27;s overall focus on compatibility and accurate emulation, but criticized the lack of both save states and user-friendly control over the emulator during runtime, even with the front ends available at the time of his review. DOSBox was named SourceForge&#x27;s Project of the Month in May 2009 and again in January 2013, making it the first project in the website&#x27;s history to receive two Project of the Month awards. On the SourceForge website, it reached 10 million downloads on July 21, 2008, and was downloaded more than 25 million times as of October 2015.

==Usage==
Since January 2011, the developers of the Wine compatibility layer have integrated DOSBox into Wine to facilitate running DOS programs that are not supported natively by the Wine Virtual DOS machine.

Since January 2015, the Internet Archive has added thousands of DOS games to its software library. , the DOS library contained 6,934 games. The collection is provided for &quot;scholarship and research purposes only&quot;.

===Forks===
* Em-DOSBox uses Emscripten to convert the emulator&#x27;s C++ code to JavaScript, making the games playable in a web browser.
* DOSBox-X aims to be compatible with all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 9x based hardware scenarios.
* DOSBox Staging aims to be a modern continuation of DOSBox; with modern coding practices and advanced features.
* DOSBox Pure is a libretro core that implements DOSBox, with some additional features such as state saving and rewind.
* jDOSBox is a pure Java x86 emulator based on DOSBox. It was created to run all DOS games as well as DOSBox, but in the browser (before Java applets were discontinued). In addition, it will boot up Windows 95/98, Windows NT 4.0, Windows XP, ReactOS and some flavors of Linux such as DSL.

===Commercial===
DOSBox has also been both the most used DOS emulator and, because of the straightforward process of making the games work on modern computers, the most popular emulation software for developers re-releasing legacy versions of their games. id Software has used DOSBox to re-release vintage games such as &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and &quot;Commander Keen&quot; on Valve&#x27;s Steam. In the process, it was reported they violated the program&#x27;s license, the GNU GPL, by not packaging the license text; the breach, which was reported as an oversight, was promptly resolved. Activision Blizzard has also used it to re-release Sierra Entertainment&#x27;s DOS games. LucasArts used it to rerelease &quot;Star Wars: Dark Forces&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: TIE Fighter&quot; for modern machines on Steam and GOG.com. 2K Games producer Jason Bergman stated the company used DOSBox for Steam rereleases of certain installments of the &quot;XCOM&quot; series. Bethesda Softworks has recommended DOSBox and provided a link to the DOSBox website on the downloads page for &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Arena&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall&quot;. It also included DOSBox with both games in &quot;The Elder Scrolls Anthology&quot; release.

Electronic Arts&#x27; Origin client uses DOSBox for the platform&#x27;s DOS games, including Electronic Arts titles such as &quot;Syndicate&quot; and &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.

<text>Francesco Soriano (1548 or 1549, in Soriano nel Cimino – 19 July 1621, in Rome) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance. He was one of the most skilled members of the Roman School in the first generation after Palestrina.

Soriano was born at Soriano, near Viterbo. He studied at the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome with several people including Palestrina, became a priest in the 1570s and by 1580 was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at S. Luigi dei Francesi, also in Rome. In 1581 he moved to Mantua, taking a position at the Gonzaga court there; but in 1586 he moved back to Rome where he spent the rest of his life working as choirmaster at three separate churches, including the Cappella Giulia at St. Peter&#x27;s. He retired in 1620.

Soriano worked with Felice Anerio to revise the Roman Gradual in accordance with the needs of the Counter-Reformation; this work was left incomplete by Palestrina.

Stylistically, Soriano&#x27;s music is much like Palestrina&#x27;s, but shows some influence from the progressive trends prevalent around the turn of the century. He adopted the polychoral style, while retaining the smooth polyphonic treatment of Palestrina, and he had a liking for homophonic textures, which generally made it easier to understand the sung text.

He wrote masses, motets (some for eight voices), psalms (one collection, published in Venice in 1616, is for 12 voices and basso continuo), settings of the Passion according to each of the four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), Marian antiphons, and several books of madrigals. His Passion settings are significant predecessors of the more famous settings from the Baroque era, for instance, those by J.S. Bach; they are set in a restrained but dramatic style, with some attempt at characterization. In some ways they are a predecessor of the oratorio, mixing solo voice, chorus, and non-acted character roles, but in a style more related to Palestrina than to anything Baroque.

<text>Paul William Scott Anderson (born 4 March 1965) is an English film director, screenwriter, and producer who often makes science fiction films and video game adaptations.

Anderson made his feature film debut with the British independent film &quot;Shopping&quot; (1994); he found commercial success with his second film, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), made in the US, based on the first couple of video games of the same name by Midway Games. He is best known as the creative voice behind the first six live-action films of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film series (2002–2016), which stars Milla Jovovich (whom he married in 2009), and is based on the Capcom video game series of the same name. The series&#x27; first six live-action films, of which Anderson directed four, have collectively grossed over $1 billion worldwide. Other notable films of Anderson&#x27;s are &quot;Event Horizon&quot; (1997), an initial critical and commercial disappointment that found renewed appreciation on home media; &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004), based on the crossover concept of the same name between the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; franchises; &quot;Death Race&quot; (2008), a remake/prequel to 1975&#x27;s &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;, and the epic romantic historical disaster &quot;Pompeii&quot; (2014).

Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt founded Impact Pictures in 1992, under which most of Anderson&#x27;s films have been made.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Wallsend, North Tyneside in England. At the age of nine, he began making films with a Super 8 film camera. After attending Royal Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, England he became the youngest person ever to graduate from the University of Warwick with a B.A. degree in film and literature.

==Career==
Anderson began his professional career as a writer on the British crime drama film comedy series &quot;El C.I.D.&quot;, which ran for three series, from 1990 to 1992, and starred Alfred Molina in its first two. He met producer Jeremy Bolt and they founded Impact Pictures in 1992, looking to raise money for Anderson&#x27;s feature film debut as a director, from an action crime drama script of his own called &quot;Shopping&quot;. After much trouble securing funding, &quot;Shopping&quot;, which stars Sean Pertwee, Jude Law (in his first feature film role) and Sadie Frost, was released in the United Kingdom in 1994. The censors of the British Board of Film Classification were not happy with the film&#x27;s violence and delayed its release for months. When it was eventually released, critics panned it, and some cinemas decided to ban it for promoting an &quot;irresponsible&quot; outlook. In the United States, it received only an edited, direct-to-video release two years later. Anderson credits &quot;Shopping&quot; for inspiring Channel Four Films, who had financed it, to also finance the more successful &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; and &quot;Trainspotting&quot; films by Danny Boyle, which in turn, he believes, made critics reassess his film in a more positive light in later years, as one of the first in a new wave of British films concerning its youth. &quot;Shopping&quot; is Anderson&#x27;s one and only British film, as he grew up watching American and mainland European movies, never imagining himself a British filmmaker. When &quot;Shopping&quot; was accepted in the Sundance Film Festival, American studios noticed its impressive look and style despite its relatively small $2 million budget, which led to opportunities in Hollywood for Anderson.

===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and commercial success===
Anderson directed the fantasy martial arts video game adaptation &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; in 1995. Using a script written by Kevin Droney, the film was based on the first entry in the video game franchise by Midway Games, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, although elements and characters were borrowed from the original game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. The film featured an ensemble cast, including Robin Shou as Liu Kang and Christopher Lambert as Raiden. Anderson became interested in the project because he often played the game at arcades. The production company decided to hire him based on the accomplished visual flair of &quot;Shopping&quot;, which was filmed on a very low budget. Anderson, who at the time knew nothing about visual effects or fight scenes, had to study every book on visual effects that he could find and learned about filming the fight scenes while they were being shot, often consulting those who were experienced in fight choreography on set, such as Shou. 

The film had extensive reshoots in order to add additional fights based on feedback from test screenings, which were attended by fans of the video game franchise. The production company decided to release &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; in August 1995, in the hope that the film would become a summer blockbuster. &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was better received by critics, who gave it a mixed to negative reception. Critics praised the atmosphere, visuals, and fighting sequences but criticized the plot, dialogue, and acting. It fared better with audiences and fans of the video games and scored a high A− on a CinemaScore poll. As a result, it spent three weeks as the highest-grossing film at the US box office and earned over $122 million worldwide, produced on a budget of $18 million. It proved a major success for Anderson and has been recognised as one of the first financially successful film adaptations of a video game. Anderson and most cast members, including Lambert, declined to return for the sequel, &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, which, when released, was critically panned and underperformed at the box office.

===&quot;Event Horizon&quot;, &quot;Soldier&quot; and &quot;The Sight&quot;===
The success of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; gave Anderson free rein to choose his next project, the science fiction action film &quot;Soldier&quot;, written by &quot;Blade Runner&quot; screenwriter David Peoples. Peoples&#x27; script—and eventually the film itself—contains references to his work on &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and can be considered to be taking place in the same universe, as a sidequel or standalone sequel of sorts. Kurt Russell became attached to star but decided to take some time off to build up his body, as required by the role, which delayed the production. In the meantime, Anderson directed the 1997 science fiction horror film &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, written by Philip Eisner and starring Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. 

Despite praise for its visuals and production design, it was not well received by critics or audiences (D+ on a Cinemascore poll), and failed to break even, which Anderson blamed on a tight post-production schedule and studio-enforced cuts. It later sold well on home video and gained a small cult following. Plans to complete a director&#x27;s cut restoring the deleted footage were abandoned when it was discovered that most of it had been lost or degraded. &quot;Soldier&quot; was eventually completed and released in 1998 but was a critical and commercial disaster, making less than $15 million in the US, on a budget of $60 million, and releasing straight-to-video in several other markets. Anderson has expressed his regret that the planned location shoots had to be changed to studio soundstages due to the El Niño hurricane, which ended up compromising the film&#x27;s look. He also verbalized his disappointment with Warner Bros., whom he believes tried to market the film to the same male teen audience as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, rather than to grown-up audiences, including women.

After his last two films&#x27; poor performances, Anderson was forced to put his planned remake of the cult film &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; on hold, and he set about writing and directing the 2000 supernatural mystery drama TV film &quot;The Sight&quot;, starring Andrew McCarthy. It was meant as a pilot for a potential series, but despite achieving high ratings, it was not picked up. Anderson made his earlier films as &quot;Paul Anderson&quot;, the name he registered with the Directors Guild of America, but with &quot;The Sight&quot;, he began crediting himself as &quot;Paul W. S. Anderson&quot;, as filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson had registered himself with the Writers Guild of America as &quot;Paul Anderson&quot;, making it impossible for either of them to both write and direct films as &quot;Paul Anderson&quot;.

===&quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; and &quot;Death Race&quot;===
Anderson returned to cinema screens in 2002 with &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, a science fiction action horror film loosely based on the Capcom video game series of the same name. Anderson came up with the idea of adapting the games after playing the first couple of them for days in his apartment. Because Constantin Film, who had acquired the rights to the series, were not willing to spend more money than they already had on failed attempts (including a script by George A. Romero), Anderson convinced them to write the script, titled &quot;The Undead&quot;, . If they liked it, he would sell it to them as a &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film; if not, he would take it elsewhere and try to make it unrelated to the games. He saw the film as being a prequel of sorts to the first game in the series and, as such, did not include any of the games&#x27; characters, a fact criticized by fans. Instead, it stars Milla Jovovich as an original character, Alice. Jovovich is the only actor that reprised her role in all of the series&#x27; first six live-action films. In comparison to Anderson&#x27;s previous two films, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was produced on a moderate budget of $33 million and became a commercial success with a little over $100 million at the box office. 

It also performed strongly on home media. Critically, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was not received well, although, similarly to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, some reviews characterized it as one of the better attempts at adapting a video game. It received the &quot;fair&quot; rating of B by audiences on a Cinemascore poll. Its relative popularity made Capcom put homages to it in video games &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot;. Anderson did not direct, but he wrote, produced, and was otherwise heavily involved with the making of two sequels, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; (2004) and &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; (2007), which completed the first of the eventual two trilogies of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films. In the two sequels, Anderson began to introduce characters from the games, albeit in supporting roles compared to Alice. Both films received similarly negative reviews to the first but were even bigger commercial successes.

Anderson&#x27;s next project was &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, based on the crossover concept of the same name of the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; franchises, popularized by a series of Dark Horse comics and hinted at in &quot;Predator 2&quot;. A film version had been stuck in development hell for several years, despite the franchise&#x27;s crossing into every other form of media, from books to comics to video games. Anderson directed the film from a script of his own, and it was released in 2004. It received negative reviews and a B on a Cinemascore poll by audiences. It was a big commercial success, however, grossing somewhat over $170 million on a $60 million budget. A sequel was made, &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, in which Anderson was not involved, and which failed to match Anderson&#x27;s film&#x27;s commercial or even critical performance, a fact that Anderson has used to defend his film.

After completing &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, Anderson resumed work on his planned remake of &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;, which was released as &quot;Death Race&quot; in 2008. The science fiction action thriller stars Jason Statham, and Anderson directed it based on his own screenplay. He refers to it as more of a prequel than a remake on the commentary of the home video releases. It received an average reception by critics and scored a solid B+ on a Cinemascore poll. It grossed little over $75 million on a budget of $45 million, failing to prove a commercial success on the level of Anderson&#x27;s previous two films. Anderson wrote and produced two straight-to-video prequels, &quot;Death Race 2&quot; (2011) and &quot;Death Race 3: Inferno&quot; (2013), set before the events of the 2008 film. He later wrote and executive-produced &quot;Death Race: Beyond Anarchy&quot; (2018), a sequel to the first film. 

The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; productions were criticized for unsafe filming and using shell companies to avoid liability. During the filming of &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot; (2016), crew member Ricardo Cornelius died when he was caught beneath a Humvee sliding off of a rotating platform. Stunt-woman Olivia Jackson lost most of an arm and was partially paralyzed when she collided with a camera crane during the filming of a motorcycle stunt in rain and freezing conditions. It was determined that she was wearing inadequate safety equipment and that the stunt&#x27;s timing had been changed without her knowledge. During the filming of &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot; (2012), twelve extras were hospitalized with leg, neck, and back wounds after falling from a collapsing high-wheeled platform.

===&quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;Pompeii&quot;===
In 2010, Anderson wrote and directed the first installment in a second trilogy of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films, titled &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot;. The film continues the storyline from where that last one ended. Anderson envisioned the new trilogy as a way to make use of a new stylistic approach, using slow motion and 3D. Anderson filmed in native 3D, using the Sony F35 camera, mounted on the Fusion Camera System, which was previously used in &quot;Avatar&quot;. Despite negative reviews by critics and a lukewarm B in a Cinemascore poll by audiences, the film grossed $300 million on a budget of $60 million, making over $150 million that the previously most successful film in the franchise, &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;.

Anderson&#x27;s next film was the 2011 3D romantic action adventure film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, from a screenplay by Andrew Davies and Alex Litvak based on the novel of the same name. Matthew Macfadyen, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans and Logan Lerman, respectively, star as the characters from the novel Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and d&#x27;Artagnan, while Milla Jovovich plays Milady de Winter. Furthermore, Christoph Waltz stars as Cardinal Richelieu, Orlando Bloom plays the Duke of Buckingham and Mads Mikkelsen appears as Captain Rochefort. The film failed to impress critics who reviewed it negatively and scored a B on a Cinemascore poll. Commercially it did not perform very well, grossing around $132–140 million on a reported budget that ranges between $75 and 90 million.

Anderson wrote and directed the fifth installment in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film franchise, &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot;, in 2012. Anderson brought back several actors from the original trilogy of films to play alternate versions of their characters. The film received generally negative reviews and a C+ on a Cinemascore poll, the series&#x27; lowest. Produced with a budget of $65 million, it grossed $240 million on the box office which is $60 million lower than the previous film&#x27;s gross, but still overall larger than the grosses of each films of the original trilogy.

In 2014 his 3D historical disaster romance film named &quot;Pompeii&quot; was released. Inspired by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 which destroyed Pompeii, a city of the Roman Empire, the film was written by Janet Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler, and Michael Robert Johnson; it stars Kit Harington, Emily Browning, Carrie-Anne Moss, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jessica Lucas, with Jared Harris, and Kiefer Sutherland. The movie received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics and was rated a B in a Cinemascore poll. &quot;Pompeii&quot; was a modest box office success on the box office, grossing $108–118 million on a reported budget between $80 and 100 million.

In late 2016 in Japan, and early 2017 in the rest of the world, Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot; was released, which according to both him and Jovovich is the last &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film they will be involved with. Anderson designed the film &quot;to come full circle&quot;, provide answers to some of the series&#x27; mysteries, and provide closure for the character of Alice. He decided to abandon the previous two films&#x27; stylistic approach of using slow motion in favor of a more fast and gritty feeling, and he also decided to convert the film in 3D in post, instead of filming with 3D cameras. His first daughter with Jovovich, Ever Gabo Anderson, was cast in a double role, as both a young version of Alice and the character of Red Queen introduced in the original film. The film received average to negative reviews, slightly better than the previous installments, and more along the lines of the original film. It was rated B by audiences on a Cinemascore poll, which is the highest rating in the series, and shared with the first and second films. The film grossed $312 million on a budget of $40 million, in large part due to a record $94.3 million opening in China, making it Anderson&#x27;s highest-grossing film.

=== &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; ===
In December 2020, Anderson directed &quot;Monster Hunter&quot;, based on Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; video-game franchise. It was released in December 2020 after delays relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a disappointing gross of $43 million against a $60 million budget; and received mixed reviews.

===Future projects===
Anderson is set to write and direct an adaptation of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s short story &quot;In the Lost Lands&quot;. 

He is also set to write and direct an upcoming film adaptation of The House of the Dead video game, specifically its third canonical installment. The said movie is set to begin production mid- to late- 2025.

==Canceled projects==
Peter V. Brett&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Warded Man&quot; was optioned for film production by Anderson and longtime producing partner Jeremy Bolt, but a 2016 update of Brett&#x27;s website said that they were no longer involved in the project.

==Personal life==

Anderson began dating Milla Jovovich, who starred in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, in 2002 after the film&#x27;s release. He proposed to her in 2003; they were &quot;engaged on-and-off for four years&quot; before becoming a couple again early in 2007. On 3 November 2007, Jovovich gave birth to their first child, daughter Ever Anderson, in Los Angeles. Anderson and Jovovich married on 22 August 2009.

Their second child, a daughter, Dashiel, was born in April 2015. In August 2019, Jovovich revealed that they were expecting a third daughter, Osian, after having a miscarriage two years prior. Their third daughter was born in February 2020.

==Reception==
Critical reception to Anderson&#x27;s films has been negative. However, Quentin Tarantino named Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; as one of his favorite films of 2011. Additionally, &quot;Variety&quot; named &quot;Event Horizon&quot; as the 94th best horror film of all time. While &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and some of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films commonly feature on lists about the best film adaptations of video games, such lists mention that films of the genre are, at best, lackluster. Anderson has repeatedly said that he considers himself to be a &quot;populist filmmaker&quot;, who only cares about whether his movies entertain the audience and make them cheer in the cinema, rather than their reception by professional critics.

<text>The Green Mile is a 1999 American fantasy crime drama film written, directed and co-produced by Frank Darabont and based on the 1996 novel by Stephen King. It stars Tom Hanks as a death row prison guard during the Great Depression who witnesses supernatural events following the arrival of an enigmatic convict (Michael Clarke Duncan) at his facility. David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, Sam Rockwell, and James Cromwell appear in supporting roles.

The film premiered in the United States on December 10, 1999, to positive reviews from critics, who praised Darabont&#x27;s direction and writing, emotional weight, and performances (particularly for Hanks and Duncan), although its length received criticism. It was a commercial success, grossing $286.8 million from its $60 million budget, and was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Duncan, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Plot==
In 1999, an elderly man, Paul Edgecomb, cries while watching the film &quot;Top Hat&quot;. He explains to his companion Elaine that it reminds him of events he witnessed as an officer at Cold Mountain Penitentiary death row, &quot;The Green Mile&quot;.

In 1935, Paul supervises corrections officers Brutus &quot;Brutal&quot; Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger, and Percy Wetmore. Percy is despised by the other guards for his sadistic and cruel actions toward the prisoners, and he flaunts his connections to the State Governor to avoid punishment. He repeatedly antagonizes prisoner Eduard &quot;Del&quot; Delacroix, and breaks Del&#x27;s fingers with a nightstick.

John Coffey, a physically imposing but very gentle African-American man, is on death row after being sentenced to death for the rape and murder of two white girls. William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton is also sent to the prison soon after, with his psychotic behavior earning him spells in the padded cell. Paul comes to learn that John has the ability to perform miracles after he heals his severe bladder infection by touching him. John also resurrects Del&#x27;s pet mouse Mr. Jingles after it was killed by Percy. Paul begins to doubt John&#x27;s guilt.

Percy&#x27;s wish to officiate an execution is granted on condition he immediately thereafter transfer from the penitentiary to a job at an insane asylum. At Del&#x27;s execution, Percy deliberately avoids soaking the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del&#x27;s head, leading to his gruesome and agonizing death. John also feels Del&#x27;s pain. The other officers punish Percy by forcing him into a straitjacket for a few hours in the padded cell. Meanwhile they drug Wharton, and smuggle John out to heal Warden Moores&#x27; wife Melinda of a terminal brain tumor.

Upon returning to the prison, Paul and Brutus release Percy but warn him not to overreact. John transfers Melinda&#x27;s affliction into Percy&#x27;s brain, and Percy shoots Wharton dead. John reveals in a vision to Paul that Wharton was the true culprit of the crimes for which he was wrongfully condemned. Percy, in a catatonic state, is committed to the insane asylum where he had planned to work.

Paul is distraught at the thought of executing John, confirmed to be innocent, and offers to let him go. John, however, tells him that execution would actually be a mercy as the world is too cruel for him; he is in constant pain from the suffering people inflict upon each other. John&#x27;s last request is to watch a movie, having never seen one before. He, Paul, and the other officers watch &quot;Top Hat&quot;. As John is taken to be executed, he asks not to have a hood placed over his head, as he is afraid of the dark. The officers begin to cry as John is executed on Paul&#x27;s order.

Back in the present day, Paul tells Elaine that John&#x27;s execution was the last that he and Brutal officiated, as they both left the prison and took jobs in the juvenile system. He reveals to Elaine that Mr. Jingles is still alive, and that he himself is now 108 years old, having been 44 when John was executed. While Elaine sees Paul&#x27;s long life as a miracle, Paul speculates that outliving all of his loved ones is his divine punishment for John&#x27;s execution. After Elaine&#x27;s funeral, Paul muses on how much longer he has to live, lamenting that &quot;sometimes the Green Mile seems so long.&quot;

== Cast ==


==Production==

===Development===
Frank Darabont adapted Stephen King&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, into a screenplay in under eight weeks.

The film was shot at Warner Hollywood Studios, West Hollywood, California; and on location in Shelbyville, Tennessee; Blowing Rock, North Carolina; and the old Tennessee State Prison. The interior sets were custom built by production designer Terence Marsh. &quot;We tried to give our set a sense of space. A sense of history. And a sense of mystery, in a way. We chose the elongated cathedral-like windows because there is a very mystical element in this movie, a supernatural element [...] It presented us with lots of opportunities&quot;, he said. The electric chair was also a bespoke design, and was inspired by real prisons which have the device.

The film title refers to the stretch of green floor that the hallway inmates walk down before they are to be executed by electric chair.

===Casting===
Tom Hanks and Darabont met at an Academy Award luncheon in 1994. Stephen King stated he envisioned Hanks in the role and was happy when Darabont mentioned his name. Hanks was originally supposed to play elderly Paul Edgecomb as well, but the makeup tests did not make him look credible enough to be an elderly man. Because of this, Dabbs Greer was hired to play the older Edgecomb, his final film role.

Michael Clarke Duncan credited his casting to Bruce Willis, with whom he had worked on the film &quot;Armageddon&quot; one year earlier. According to Duncan, Willis introduced him to Darabont after hearing of the open call for John Coffey. Basketball player Shaquille O&#x27;Neal has stated he turned down the role of John Coffey. Josh Brolin was considered for the role of William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton.

David Morse had not heard about the script until he was offered the role. He stated he was in tears by the end of it. Darabont wanted James Cromwell from the start, and after he read the script, Cromwell was moved and agreed.

===Music===
The official film soundtrack, &quot;Music from the Motion Picture The Green Mile&quot;, was released on December 19, 1999, by Warner Bros. It contains 37 tracks, primarily instrumental tracks from the film score by Thomas Newman. It also contains four vocal tracks: &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; by Fred Astaire, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love, Baby&quot; by Billie Holiday, &quot;Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?&quot; by Gene Austin, and &quot;Charmaine&quot; by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians.

==Release==

===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; opened on December 10, 1999, in 2,875 theaters and grossed $18 million in its opening weekend, placing second at the box office, just behind &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; with $18.2 million, although Warner Bros. insisted that &quot;The Green Mile&quot; was the number one film. However, it did finish first for the week with $23.9 million compared to &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; $22.1 million. It remained at number two in its second weekend and in the top 10 for 10 weeks but never reached number one for the weekend. It went on to gross $136.8 million in the U.S. and Canada and $150 million in other territories, bringing a worldwide total of $286.8 million, against its production budget of $60 million. It was the second highest-grosser in Japan for the year with a gross of $55.3 million.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;The Green Mile&quot; holds an approval rating of 79% based on 136 reviews with an average rating of 6.80/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;Though &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is long, critics say it&#x27;s an absorbing, emotionally powerful experience.&quot; At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars, writing, &quot;The film is a shade over three hours long. I appreciated the extra time, which allows us to feel the passage of prison months and years ... it tells a story with beginning, middle, end, vivid characters, humor, outrage and emotional release&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Lisa Schwarzbaum also took note of the film&#x27;s length, but praised Tom Hanks&#x27; &quot;superior&quot; performance and Darabont&#x27;s direction. &quot;Darabont&#x27;s style of picture making is well matched to King-size yarn spinning. The director isn&#x27;t afraid to let big emotions and grand gestures linger&quot;, she said.

&quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s Edward Guthmann thought the cinematography was &quot;handsome&quot;, and the music was &quot;florid and melodramatic&quot;. He added, &quot;Darabont is such a committed filmmaker, and believes so earnestly and intensely in the stories he puts onscreen&quot;. Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the storytelling &quot;brilliant&quot;, and said &quot;From its deceptively easygoing beginning to the heart-wrenching finale, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; keeps you wonderfully high above the cynical ground.&quot;

Some critics had a less positive response. Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; opined, &quot;By inflating the simple story with a languorous pace, pregnant pauses, long reaction shots and an infinitely slow metabolism, Darabont has burdened his movie version with more self-importance than it can possibly sustain.&quot; While complimenting the production design and soundtrack, the critic from &quot;Timeout&quot; magazine thought some scenes were tiresome and the film &quot;suffers from a surfeit of plot threads and characters&quot;.

Writing for the BBC, Clark Collis criticized the film&#x27;s length and pacing. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; thought &quot;The Green Mile&quot; was weaker than Darabont&#x27;s previous film, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994). He stated, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is a &quot;lumbering, self-important three-hour melodrama that defies credibility at every turn&quot;.

Stephen King praised the film adaptation, although he felt the film was a little &quot;soft&quot; in some ways. He added, &quot;I like to joke with Frank that his movie was really the first R-rated Hallmark Hall of Fame production. For a story that is set on death row, it has a really feel-good, praise-the-human condition sentiment to it. I certainly don’t have a problem with that because I am a sentimentalist at heart.&quot;

<doc id="946171" wikidata="Q3062919" url="?curid=946171" title="Warlingham">
<text>Warlingham is a village and civil parish in the Tandridge district of Surrey, England, south of London and east of Guildford. Warlingham is the centre of a civil parish that includes Hamsey Green to the north. Caterham is to the southwest.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Warlingham&quot; is first recorded as &quot;Warlyngham&quot; in 1144 and first appears with the modern spelling in 1198. Other medieval variants include &quot;Warlinggeham&quot; (), &quot;Werlingham&quot; (1263) and &quot;Worlingham&quot; (1291). The name is generally agreed have its origins in Old English and to mean &quot;the home(stead) &quot;(ham)&quot; of the followers &quot;((l)ing)&quot; of &quot;Wærla&quot;&quot;.

==History==
===Early history, Dark Ages and Middle Ages===

Flint implements are not uncommon, and reputed eoliths have been found in the pebble beds near the village centre. In 1909 several cinerary urns of late Celtic date were found near the road towards Worms Heath; one of them contained bones. In several places are depressions which may have been pit houses. Two of these are in the grounds of Bryn Cottage.

The village lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative division of Tandridge hundred.

Its rectorial estate, glebe and rectory was from early times acquired by the manor, which was held by a priory, that of Bermondsey; held with the manor until a 1675 gift to trustees by Harmon Atwood.

===Manors===

Three manors owned virtually all of the land: &quot;Warlingham&quot;, &quot;Crewes/Carewes&quot; and &quot;Westhall&quot;.
; Warlingham Manor
Warlingham Manor was assigned by William de Watevile in 1144 to Bermondsey Priory, which held it until the dissolution of the monasteries, subject to certain retained rights to the de Watevile, later de Godstone family. In the 13th century, a lawsuit with the Abbey of Hyde over the boundary of their Sanderstead manor took place. Immediately after the ecclesiastic Reformation in 1544, Sir John Gresham, who made large loans to the state, was, subject to a few years&#x27; more rent from its senior tenants being retained by the Crown, granted the whole estate. In 1591 his grandson sold it to John Ownstead, though this was not done until Elizabeth I received her fine for her licence on conveyance (equivalent to a stamp duty on landed estates; legally imposed as overlord) for transferring the property. Later this manor descended to Rev. Atwood Wigsell of Sanderstead Court in the 18th century and remained in that family until at least 1911.
;Crewes Manor
In 1353 permission was given to Sir Richard Willoughby and his wife to grant to William and Nicholas Carew the manor of Beddington at a yearly rent of 20 marks. They retained to themselves the manor of Warlingham, a part that was later known as Carew&#x27;s and, later still, as Crewe&#x27;s manor. A royal grant of free warren followed in 1375 to the lord of this manor. Later medieval owners included the Huscarl, Delamere and Saunders families leading up to the Dissolution/Reformation. Sir Edmund Walsingham&#x27;s son was left the manor by his sister who married the then owner, Sir Thomas Walsingham, from whom it passed to his second son who sold it. Its purchaser was Edward Weston, who was followed as owner by Garrett Weston, and his son-in-law, Michael Wilkins, who sold Crewes in 1644. Only two years later Humphrey Gould sold it to Richard Rochdale, citizen and brewer of London. His heirs sold it to John Pemberton, who later sold the manor to John Heathfield the elder, a brewer of Croydon, in whose family it remained until 1804 when it was purchased by William Coles of Addington. By 1808, however, Charles Pieschall was lord of the manor, and after this the Smith family of Selsdon held it until at least 1911.
;Westhall Manor
William Rede exchanged his Oatlands Palace for Tandridge Priory including this manor with King Henry VIII. However, he died before the grant was completed, leaving as heir his infant son John Rede to whom the king on 2 January 1538 granted the priory of Tandridge, including the manor of &quot;Warlingham or Westhall&quot;. Sir Robert Clayton of Marden, Godstone and of Bletchingley held this from 1674 to 1707. His nephew, Sir William Clayton, inherited his estates and, after this, the manor continued to be held by the Claytons with the manor of Bletchingley, until the estate was subdivided.

====History of the church====
All Saints&#x27; Church&#x27;s present building dates back to around the year 1250. The church is built of flint rubble with stone dressings, partly rendered. Notable features include a 16th-century (Tudor period) wall painting of St Christopher carrying Jesus Christ. Local vicars have maintained a preaching that long-serving Archbishop Cranmer began experimenting with the first Book of Common Prayer at this church. A south window contains stained glass depicting the presentation of the first English Prayer Book to King Edward VI by Archbishop Cranmer. In the 14th century the east window was installed, and it has now been renewed in the same pattern by artist J. O. Scott. All Saints&#x27; has a nave including a baptistry to the west, south porch and aisle with chancel to east, and vestry addition to the north; on the north side are lancet windows, with one two-light perpendicular window in the north and south walls. Its gabled wooden porch has cusped bargeboards; the original stone door surround of the south door was rebuilt from pieces in a later restoration.

In 1907 a second church was constructed in front of Memorial Park and at the foot of the road to Chelsham, dedicated to St Christopher.

===Post Industrial Revolution===
In 1841 Warlingham had 512 inhabitants; a notable resident of the Victorian period was Sir Joseph Swan, inventor of the incandescent light bulb. Sir George Gilbert Scott led the project to renovate and restore All Saints&#x27; Church in 1857. Its south aisle was added in 1893. All Saints&#x27; plain-tiled roof with tile-hung bellchamber above, under a gilt and iron weathervane, was also added in 1893.

Five Coal-tax posts are listed for historic importance in Warlingham parish and there are six architecturally listed buildings: Court Cottage, The Vicarage, 23-31 Leas Road, the Church of All Saints, &quot;The White Lion&quot; (public house) and The Barn, sited by the vicarage. Also the World War I War Memorial has made the national heritage list.
Both the vicarage and the church are listed at the higher grade of Grade II* whereas the rest are at Grade II.

Warlingham gave its name to the large psychiatric hospital that was opened on the borders of Warlingham and Chelsham in 1903. Originally called the &quot;Croydon Mental Hospital&quot; the institution was renamed &quot;Warlingham Park Hospital&quot; in the 1930s. The buildings, apart from the water tower, were demolished and the site redeveloped as a private housing estate called &quot;Greatpark&quot; in the early years of the 21st century.

During the Second World War, Warlingham was witness to the Battle of Britain, much of which was fought in the skies above this part of Surrey. The former RAF bases of Biggin Hill and Kenley were within a few miles of Warlingham in either direction, and from there fighters would intercept German bombers navigating their way up to London along the valley between Warlingham and Woldingham (then known as &#x27;Bombers&#x27; Alley&#x27;). Warlingham War Memorial is the most prominent feature breaking up a lightly wooded, shop-surrounded green in the village. It is a simple yet poignant monument dedicated to the great many local people who made sacrifices during the two world wars in the 20th Century.

Lead singer of The Clash, Joe Strummer moved to Warlingham after his diplomat father and family returned to the UK.

Reggae singer and instrumentalist Smiley Culture lived in Warlingham. His death, as a result of a self-inflicted stabbing, occurred at his home in 2011 during a police arrest.

==Geography==

Warlingham is situated on the scarp slope of the North Downs and parts of the village are 650 feet (200 metres) above sea level. This means that on the rare occasion it does snow in southern England, Warlingham will often get a light covering while neighbouring low-lying areas remain untouched. Warlingham&#x27;s height also allows for some panoramic views over central London (on the stretch of the Limpsfield road between Warlingham village and Botley Hill Farm). On a clear day all the major skyscrapers (including Canary Wharf, the Gherkin and the NatWest tower) can be seen, and the hills north of London can be made out on the horizon.

Warlingham is in the Green Belt. Surrounding the town are the slopes of the North Downs, with rolling chalk meadow hillsides interspersed with woodlands. Parts of the adjacent Woldingham valley to the south have been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Blanchman&#x27;s Farm Nature Reserve was set up in 1991 and was the first community wildlife area in Tandridge. It covers and includes a restored pond, around 10,000 native trees, and a path for wheelchair access.

===Elevations===
Elevations vary from 110m AOD at Woldingham Road, at the southernmost point of the parish, with a gentle increase in height through the village along the main road heading to the southeast, to the highest elevation (199.6m) at Limpsfield Road.

==Economy==
Today, most of Warlingham&#x27;s working-age population works in Croydon or central London, making Warlingham part of the London commuter belt.

==Local government==
Surrey County Council, headquartered in Reigate, elects one councillor for the Warlingham division every four years. Conservative Becky Rush was elected in a by-election in 2019.
Warlingham has five representatives across two wards on Tandridge District Council, headquartered in Oxted:
Warlingham has a civil parish council comprising two wards. Warlingham East ward elects six councillors, with Warlingham West ward electing five every four years. The parish council clerk is Gina Caunt.

==Amenities==
Warlingham is centred on a triangular, tree-lined village green that contains a war memorial. Shops nearby include supermarkets, a pharmacy, a hardware store, a newsagent, two hair salons, two local firms of estate agents and a local solicitors. Also situated on the green are a village hall, a few small rustic cottages, a gift shop, and several dress shops and restaurants. To the south of The Green is School Common, an open recreational area with a notable wildlife pond known as Willeypit or Willey&#x27;s Pit pond, and some Alms Houses.

A short walk from the green is the community library, which is open most days of the week, and also provides laminating, photocopying, printing and scanning services.
Warlingham formerly had a total of four pubs of varying character and locations (including the old coaching Inn, the &#x27;White Lion&#x27;). This unusual concentration of pubs in Warlingham was due to the neighbouring villages of Sanderstead, Woldingham and Farleigh not having any pubs of their own. In recent years the Leather Bottle has been converted to a Spanish restaurant and Tapas bar and as of 2022 has changed again to a Turkish restaurant and takeaway. The Hare &amp; Hounds has become a spaghetti restaurant, leaving the aforementioned White Lion and The Horseshoe.

Warlingham has a large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, built on the site of the former London Transport bus garage known as Chelsham (garage code: CM).

==Local schools==
*Warlingham School is closer to Hamsey Green than Warlingham (and is on the same campus as Hamsey Green Junior and Infant schools) and is a senior state school, with a multi-course Sixth Form. 
*Warlingham Park School is a small private school which is very close to Chelsham Common (and is near the Great Park housing estate).
*Warlingham Village Primary School is on Farleigh Road – which historically was &quot;Farleigh School&quot;.
*Private schools include Caterham, Woldingham School for Girls, Croydon High, Whitgift and Trinity.

==Local transport==
Warlingham is served by two railway stations on adjacent but separate lines (a legacy of the Victorian railway boom, and the competition between two private companies to service this part of Surrey).

Upper Warlingham railway station is about a mile from Warlingham and has fast Southern services to London Victoria and London Bridge as well as East Grinstead and Uckfield. The &quot;Upper&quot; prefix occurs because of a former station on the Caterham line which was named Warlingham until 11 June 1956 despite being even further away from the village. This station was renamed Whyteleafe South from that date.

Just a few minutes&#x27; walk from Upper Warlingham is Whyteleafe railway station, which has slightly slower trains to London and Caterham departing every quarter of an hour.

The village is served by London Buses route 403 and Metrobus routes 409 and 411. These buses provide connections to Croydon, Selsdon, Caterham, Redhill, Reigate, Godstone, Lingfield and East Grinstead.

==Sport==
Warlingham has a Non-League football club Warlingham F.C. Warlingham Sports Club dates back to 1856 and incorporates Warlingham Squash and Racketball Club, Warlingham Cricket Club, and Warlingham Tennis Club, all of which are very active.

Warlingham is also home to Warlingham Rugby Football Club, which was founded in 1922.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who own their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who own their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<text>Rafat () is a Palestinian town in the Jerusalem Governorate of the State of Palestine, located approximately southwest of the city of Ramallah in the central West Bank. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, it had a population of 2,941 in 2017. Its total land area consists of 3,773 dunams.

==Location==
Rafat is located 10.9 km north-west of Jerusalem. It is bordered by Qalandiya to the east, Al Judeira to the north, Ramallah to the west, and Beituniya to the south.

==History==
Ceramics from the Byzantine era have been found here.

===Ottoman era===
Rafat, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1596, the village was noted in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Quds of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Quds. The population was 27 households, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on various agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and/or beehives, in addition to &quot;occasional revenues&quot;; a total of 3,300 akçe.

In 1838, it was noted as a Muslim village in the Jerusalem District. During this time, residents from Rafat settled Danyal near al-Ramla, establishing it as a dependency – or satellite village – of their home village.

In 1863 Victor Guérin found Rafat to have one hundred and twenty inhabitants, and was located on a mound. It had mosque is dedicated to Sheikh &quot;Ahmed&quot;. He further noted that in some houses several stones looked of an ancient appearance. In one house he found a fragment of a broken column.

An Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that &quot;rafat&quot; had 35 houses and a population of 100, though the population count included men, only.

In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described Rafat as: &quot;a small hamlet on a ridge, with a spring to the west, and many rock cut tombs.&quot;

In 1896 the population of Rafat was estimated to be about 195 persons.

===British Mandate era===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Rafat had a population of 219 Muslims, while according to the 1931 census Rafat had a population of 218 inhabitants, in 46 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, Rafat had a population of 280 Muslims, and a land area of 3,777 dunams. Of this, 252 dunams were designated for plantations and irrigable land, 1,965 dunams were for cereals, while 21 dunams were built-up.

===Jordanian era===
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Rafat came under Jordanian rule.

In 1961, the population of Rafat was 504.

===Post-1967===
After the Six-Day War in 1967, Rafat has been under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census conducted by the Israeli authorities was 499, 75% of whom originated from the Israeli territory.

According to ARIJ Israel has confiscated 287 dunums of land (8.5% of the total area of the village) for the construction of Camp Ofer (later Ofer Prison). More lands have been confiscated from Rafat for the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier. 637 dunums, which comprises 18.7% of the village’s total area, is isolated behind the wall, on the Israeli side.

<doc id="946186" wikidata="Q17079868" url="?curid=946186" title="Menlo Logistics">
<text>Menlo Logistics was a global supply chain company operating in 20 countries on five continents. Its core business offerings included third-party logistics and supply chain management, and the company specialized in the integration of all functions across the supply chain. The company operated 210 locations worldwide and had of warehouse capacity.

It was a business unit of Con-way, which was acquired in 2015 by XPO, Inc.. Sister companies included Con-way Freight, Con-way Truckload, and Con-way Multimodal.

==History==

The idea for Menlo Logistics was developed in the late 1980s. At that time, CF Inc.’s director of marketing, John Williford, presented the idea for the company&#x27;s creation — an organization that offered warehouse, inventory, and transportation management as well as full integration of supply chain links through customized systems and software — to upper management. The initial business plan was to create, implement, and manage logistics projects for its customers.

On October 26, 1990, Menlo Logistics Inc. was formed. The name was a deliberate choice to prompt an association with California’s Menlo Park, which was well known as the home of venture capitalists and high-tech industries.

Menlo Logistics established itself as a third-party logistics provider in the 1990s, and rode the popularity of the outsourcing trend by notching double-digit growth every year during that era. One of Menlo’s early success stories was its successful bid on a $100 million distribution contract with Sears. The department store wanted to close its internal distribution system, which cost Sears about twice as much as its competitors at 7 percent of its sales.


In December 2000, Menlo Logistics collaborated with General Motors to create Vector SCM, a new global supply chain management company serving the automotive industry.

Effective January 1, 2002, Con-Way formed Menlo Worldwide Logistics by renaming Menlo Logistics and combining it with Vector SCM and the freight forwarding operations of Emery Worldwide (initially renamed Emery Forwarding and later renamed Menlo Worldwide Forwarding). Menlo Worldwide Logistics absorbed the operations of Emery’s logistics unit, Emery Global Logistics (EGL). The EGL operations gave Menlo Worldwide Logistics presence in Asia and South America, and expanded its European scope. The company began leveraging these operations to pursue organic growth outside of North America and grow its European footprint.

In December 2004, Con-Way sold Menlo Worldwide Forwarding to United Parcel Service, and Con-Way streamlined its operating units by merging Con-Way Transportation Service’s logistics unit, Con-way Logistics, into Menlo Worldwide Logistics. This completed the rationalization of three logistics entities into a single business unit.
In 2006, GM exercised its right to purchase Menlo Logistics&#x27; interest in Vector SCM, and the sale was completed in December.

In seeking to grow its business in the Asian logistics market, Menlo purchased two Asian logistics companies, Cougar Holdings Pte, Ltd. and Chic Holdings, Ltd. in 2007. Singapore-based Cougar enlarged Menlo&#x27;s operational scope in southeastern Asia, and Shanghai-based Chic significantly expanded Menlo&#x27;s presence in China.

In October 2015 Menlo Logistics and its parent Con-Way were acquired by XPO, Inc..

<text>Nature One is one of the largest European open-air electronic music festivals, featuring many renowned DJs from Germany and all over the world. In significance it is not as big as Mayday nor as old, having started three years later than the Mayday festival. However, attendance has surpassed the Mayday, even when one takes into account that the Mayday only lasts one evening, while the Nature One has two main evenings with additional smaller events from Thursday till Sunday.

== Overview ==

&quot;Nature One&quot; tickets cost approximately 70 euros (as of 2010). But unlike the Love Parade, the only real damage to nature occurs due to the trampling of the grass on the bunker hills and the fields used for camping (the crops have always been harvested by the time the festival starts).

As a special attraction there is a fireworks display on Saturday evening.

The festival lasts for one long weekend each year always on the first weekend of August.

In 2004 the festival had an attendance of roughly 53,000, with over 40,000 using the nearby fields for camping over the weekend (officially allowed and organized by the Nature One staff).

The camping ground has always been the second festival, with many hobby DJs and some commercially organized trucks, loaded with generators and fuel, the equipment rivaling small clubs in turntables, loudspeakers and sometimes even lighting. Some people who are either unwilling or unable to pay for admission to the festival area use this fact to have a cheaper alternative festival weekend.

The festival itself is structured into four &quot;main floors&quot; each for a few thousand:
*Open Air Floor (mostly Trance)
*Century Circus (Techno)
*House of House (House, Minimal)
*Classic Terminal
There are also a few smaller areas (in 2012, there are 18 smaller areas), sometimes occupied by techno club crews for a few hundred.
The whole thing is located at a US missile base called &quot;Pydna&quot;, now decommissioned, which has all necessary infrastructure and space for this kind of festival, a total of 100,000 m2 (without camping, which takes up more than 1 km2).

Since 2002 Nature One is supported by eve&amp;rave Münster e.V. with drug-information desks.

== Past and future Nature One ==

== Awards ==
* Dance Music Award
** 2003: in the category &quot;Best Event&quot;

<text>Riverside station is an OC Transpo bus station on Ottawa&#x27;s Transitway that is connected to the Riverside Campus of The Ottawa Hospital near the intersection of Smyth Road and Riverside Drive. Stairs and elevators from the platform level lead directly to the interior of the hospital, making bus travel easy for medical appointments even in bad weather.

The hospital is the primary trip generator and main purpose for this station. There are no connecting bus routes here.

The station was built when the hospital underwent a major expansion of its facility. It agreed to let the transitway pass in its terrain and open a new station as there were initially no stations to be built at that location. The 4,200 square feet new administration wing and Transit station was completed in 1991.

==Service==
The following routes serve Riverside:


=== Notes ===
* Routes 93, 96, 96B, 99, and 199 serve this station during peak periods only.
* Route 55 travels along Smyth Road, just north of the station, Monday-Saturday.

<doc id="946199" wikidata="Q946160" url="?curid=946199" title="Alberto Rivera (activist)">
<text>Alberto Magno Rivera Romero (September 19, 1935June 20, 1997) was an anti-Catholic religious activist who was the source of many of the theories about the Vatican espoused by fundamentalist Christian author Jack Chick.

Chick promised to promote Rivera&#x27;s testimony even after he died. Rivera claimed to have been a Jesuit before becoming a Fundamentalist Protestant, and many of the stories Chick published about Rivera involve Jesuit activities.

==Biography==
Rivera was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain. He made numerous claims about his time as a Catholic priest and the inner workings of the Catholic Church. Most of these statements are disputed by the Catholic Church and others and Rivera was not able to provide compelling evidence in support his claims. An exposé by Gary Metz in &quot;Cornerstone&quot; magazine as well as another one in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; questioned many of Rivera&#x27;s statements about his life, alleging that he was a fraud. The two conflicting versions are summarized below.

===Rivera&#x27;s account===
According to Rivera, he was brought into a seminary in 1942 when he was 7. Two years later, as his mother was dying, she saw &quot;ugly creatures&quot; coming at her deathbed, and faced a &quot;Christless eternity&quot; because of her Catholic faith. When visiting his mother&#x27;s grave, Rivera vowed to find answers to the truth. After education at an unnamed Catholic seminary, he was sent to destroy various Protestant organizations and discredit Protestant leaders, but Rivera says that he became disillusioned upon finding that the Vatican was behind Freemasonry and that its reverence of the Virgin Mary was contradicted by the Bible. In 1965, at an Ecumenical Conference in a Guatemalan stadium, he denounced the Catholic Church to an audience of 50,000 people. Rivera says that the Jesuits then sent him to a top-secret psychiatric hospital in Spain to make him embrace the Catholic faith—what Rivera referred to as &quot;recanting his faith.&quot; Here he says that he was tortured and given poison until he nearly died, eventually being put into an iron lung because his lungs had broken down from the abuse. According to Rivera, he was &quot;nearly at death&quot; when he asked Jesus to forgive him and was miraculously healed. Rivera said that a senior Jesuit attempted to persuade Rivera to return to Catholicism, but instead was himself persuaded to give Rivera the passport and papers he needed to escape Spain. Afterwards, he flew to London and saved his sister María, a nun, after she nearly died in a convent of an unspecified illness or injury.

===&quot;Cornerstone&quot;″s account===

According to the &quot;Cornerstone&quot; exposé, Rivera had a &#x27;history of legal entanglements&#x27; including fraud, credit card theft, and writing bad checks. Warrants had been issued for his arrest in New Jersey and Florida, and he was wanted by the Spanish police for &#x27;swindles and cheats&#x27;. While in the U.S. in 1967, he said he was collecting money for a Spanish college, which never received this money. The details of his religious statements changed over time. For example, in 1964 he said that he had left the Catholic Church in July 1952. Rivera later put the date at March 20, 1967 – an almost 15-year discrepancy. Despite this second statement of conversion from Catholicism in March 1967, Rivera was still promoting Catholicism in a newspaper interview of August that same year. Although supposedly placed involuntarily in the sanatorium where he said he was nearly murdered in 1965 and held there for three months, he gave the date of his release as September 1967. This leaves a period of more than a year unaccounted for in Rivera&#x27;s narrative.

The document exhibited by Rivera to prove his status as a Catholic priest was fraudulent. The Catholic Church says his statement of having been a Jesuit priest, or another statement that he was a bishop, are not true. Rivera had only one sister who worked as a maid in a private London home, not as a nun in a convent; the statement that his sister the nun nearly died in a convent in London was a lie. In an employment form dated 1963, Rivera stated he was married to Carmen Lydia Torres, and the couple had two children in the U.S. In his narrative, Rivera said that he was a priest living in Spain in 1963.

&quot;Cornerstone&quot; also questioned Rivera&#x27;s statement to various degrees, including three doctorates (Th.D., D.D., and Ph.D.), reporting that his known chronology did not allow enough time to have completed these degrees. Rivera allegedly admitted that he had received these degrees from a non-accredited entity sometimes referred to as a diploma mill located in the state of Colorado.

==Claims==
Rivera said that the Jesuit order was responsible for the creation of communism, Islam and Nazism, and causing the World Wars, recession, the Jonestown Massacre, and the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy (a Catholic). Rivera further stated that the Catholic Church wants to spread homosexuality and abortion and that the Charismatic movement is somehow a &quot;front&quot; for the Catholic Church. He further said, as have Protestant polemicists since Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot;, that the Popes are antichrists, and that the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon. He has also said that the Jesuits were the masterminds behind the Medieval Inquisition in the 13th century. The Jesuits were, in fact, founded in 1539.

Rivera also made several allegations about Islam, which he did not offer proof for. This includes allegations that Muhammad was manipulated by the Catholic Church to create Islam and destroy the Jews and other groups of Christians, and that Muhammad&#x27;s first wife, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, was actually a Catholic nun in an Arabian monastery, who was told by a bishop to marry Muhammad and create Islam. Rivera also alleged that the Vatican staged an apparition at Fátima (named after Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad) to cultivate favor with Muslims. He further says that it also staged the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II using a Muslim as the marksman &quot;to guilt-induce the Muslim world, bringing them still closer to the Catholic faith&quot;.

==Presence in &quot;Chick Tracts&quot;==
Six of Jack Chick&#x27;s comics feature Rivera specifically: &quot;Alberto&quot;, &quot;Double Cross&quot;, &quot;The Godfathers&quot;, &quot;The Force&quot;, &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;, and &quot;The Prophet&quot;. He also wrote the introduction to Chick&#x27;s republication of &quot;The Secret History of the Jesuits&quot; by Edmond Paris.

==Death==
Rivera died in 1997 of colon cancer. His ministry was taken over by his widow, Nury Rivera.

<doc id="946203" wikidata="Q2394473" url="?curid=946203" title="David Hicks">
<text>David Matthew Hicks (born 7 August 1975) is an Australian who attended al-Qaeda&#x27;s Al Farouq training camp in Afghanistan. Hicks traveled to Pakistan after converting to Islam to learn more about the faith, eventually leading to his time in the training camp. He alleges that he was unfamiliar with al-Qaeda and had no idea that they targeted civilians. Hicks met with Osama bin Laden in 2001.

Later that year, he was captured and brought to the U.S. to be tried. He was then detained by the United States in Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where he reported undergoing torture at the hands of American soldiers, from 2002 until 2007. He was eventually convicted under the Military Commissions Act of 2006.

In 2012, his conviction was overturned because the law under which he was charged had not been passed at the time that his crimes were committed.

==Early life==
David Hicks was born in Adelaide, South Australia, to Terry and Susan Hicks. His parents separated when he was ten years old, and his father later remarried. He has a half sister.

Described by his father as &quot;a typical boy who couldn&#x27;t settle down&quot; and by his former school principal as one of &quot;the most troublesome kids&quot;, Hicks reportedly experimented with alcohol and drugs as a teenager and was expelled from Smithfield Plains High School in 1990 at age 14. Before turning 15, Hicks was given dispensation by his father from attending school. His former partner has claimed that Hicks turned to criminal activity, including vehicle theft, allegedly in order to feed himself, although no adult criminal record was ever recorded for this.

Hicks moved between various jobs, including factory work and working at a series of outback cattle stations in the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia.

==Marriage and family==
Hicks met Jodie Sparrow in Adelaide when he was 17 years old. Sparrow already had a daughter, whom Hicks raised as his own. Hicks and Sparrow had two children together, daughter Bonnie and son Terry, before separating in 1996. After their separation, Hicks moved to Japan to become a horse trainer.

He married Aloysia Brooks in 2009. Hicks appeared in court in April 2017 for allegedly assaulting a subsequent partner in Craigmore, South Australia but the case was dropped with legal costs awarded against the South Australia Police.

==Guantanamo Bay==

In 2007, Hicks consented to a plea bargain in which he pleaded guilty to charges of providing material support for terrorism by the United States Guantanamo military commission under the &quot;Military Commissions Act of 2006&quot;. Hicks received a suspended sentence and returned to Australia. The conviction was overturned by the US Court of Military Commission Review in February 2015.

Hicks became one of the first people charged and subsequently convicted under the &quot;Military Commissions Act&quot;. There was widespread Australian and international criticism and political controversy over Hicks&#x27; treatment, the evidence tendered against him, his trial outcome, and the newly created legal system under which he was prosecuted. In October 2012, the United States Court of Appeals ruled that the charge under which Hicks had been convicted was invalid because the law did not exist at the time of the alleged offence, and it could not be applied retroactively.

In January 2015, Hicks&#x27; lawyer announced that the US government had said that Hicks&#x27; conviction was not correct and that it does not dispute his innocence.

Earlier, during 1999, Hicks converted to Islam and took the name Muhammed Dawood (محمد داود). He was later reported to have been publicly denounced due to his lack of religious observance. Hicks was captured in Afghanistan in December 2001 by the Afghan Northern Alliance and sold for a US$5,000 bounty to the United States military. He was transported to Guantanamo Bay where he was designated an enemy combatant. He alleged that during his detention, he was tortured via anal examination. The United States first filed charges against Hicks in 2004 under a military commission system newly created by Presidential Order. Those proceedings failed in 2006 when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled, in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;, that the military commission system was unconstitutional. The military commission system was re-established by an act of the United States Congress.

Revised charges were filed against Hicks in February 2007 before a new commission under the new act. The following month, in accordance with a pre-trial agreement struck with convening authority Judge Susan J. Crawford, Hicks entered an Alford plea to a single newly codified charge of providing material support for terrorism. Hicks&#x27;s legal team attributed his acceptance of the plea bargain to his &quot;desperation for release from Guantanamo&quot; and duress under &quot;instances of severe beatings, sleep deprivation and other conditions of detention that contravene international human rights norms.&quot;

==Return to Australia==
In April 2007, Hicks was returned to Australia to serve the remaining nine months of a suspended seven-year sentence. During this period, he was precluded from all media contact. There was criticism that the government delayed his release until after the 2007 Australian election. Colonel Morris Davis, the former Pentagon chief prosecutor, later confessed political interference in the case by the Bush administration in the United States and the Howard government in Australia. He said that Hicks should not have been prosecuted.

Hicks served his term in Adelaide&#x27;s Yatala Labour Prison and was released under a control order on 29 December 2007. The control order expired in December 2008. Hicks still lives in Adelaide and has written an autobiography.

==Religious and militant activities==
Hicks converted to Islam, and began studying Wahhabism at a mosque in Gilles Plains, a suburb north of Adelaide. The president of the Islamic Society of South Australia, Wali Hanifi, described Hicks as having &quot;some interest in military things&quot;, and that &quot;after personal experience and research, [found] that Islam was the answer&quot;.

In 2010, Hicks explained his motivation to convert to Islam:
My motivation was not a religious search for spirituality; it was more a search for somewhere to belong and to be with people who shared my interest in world affairs. In my youth I was impulsive. Unfortunately, many of my decisions of that time are a reflection of that trait.

He renounced his faith during the earlier years of his detention at Guantánamo. In June 2006, Moazzam Begg, a British man who had also been held at Guantanamo Bay but was released in 2005, claimed in his book, &quot;Enemy Combatant: A British Muslim&#x27;s Journey to Guantanamo and Back&quot;, that Hicks had abandoned his Islamic beliefs, and had been denounced by a fellow inmate, Uthman al-Harbi, for his lack of observance. This has also been confirmed by his military lawyer, Major Michael Mori, who declined to say why Hicks was no longer a Muslim, saying it was a personal issue.

===Kosovo Liberation Army===
Around May 1999, Hicks travelled to Albania in order to join the Kosovo Liberation Army. The US military alleged that he undertook basic training and hostile action before returning to Australia and converting to Islam. The KLA did not accept Islamic fundamentalism, and many of its fighters and fundraisers were Catholic. In June 1999, the Kosovo War ended and the KLA disbanded as part of UNSCR 1244. Hicks described his time with the KLA as a life-changing experience and on his return to Australia, converted to Islam and began studying at a mosque in Gilles Plains in Adelaide.

===Lashkar-e-Taiba===
On 11 November 1999, Hicks travelled to Pakistan to study Islam and allegedly began training with Lashkar-e-Taiba (L-e-T) in early 2000. In the US Military Commission charges presented in 2004, Hicks is accused of training at the Mosqua Aqsa camp in Pakistan, after which he &quot;travelled to a border region between Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and Indian-controlled Kashmir, where he engaged in hostile action against Indian forces.&quot;.

In a March 2000 letter to his family, Hicks wrote:
don&#x27;t ask what&#x27;s happened, I can&#x27;t be bothered explaining the outcome of these strange events has put me in Pakistan-Kashmir in a training camp. Three months training. After which it is my decision whether to cross the line of control into Indian occupied Kashmir.
In another letter on 10 August 2000, Hicks wrote from Kashmir claiming to have been a guest of Pakistan&#x27;s army for two weeks at the front in the &quot;controlled war&quot; with India:
I got to fire hundreds of bullets. Most Muslim countries impose hanging for civilians arming themselves for conflict. There are not many countries in the world where a tourist, according to his visa, can go to stay with the army and shoot across the border at its enemy, legally.

During this period, Hicks kept a notebook to document his training in weapon use, explosives, and military tactics, in which he wrote that guerrilla warfare involved &quot;sacrifice for Allah&quot;. He took extensive notes on, and made sketches of, various weaponry mechanisms and attack strategies (including Heckler &amp; Koch submachine guns, the M16 assault rifle, RPG-7 grenade launcher, anti-tank rockets, and VIP security infiltration). Letters to his family detailed his training:
I learnt about weapons such as ballistic missiles, surface to surface and shoulder fired missiles, anti aircraft and anti-tank rockets, rapid fire heavy and light machine guns, pistols, AK-47s, mines and explosives. After three months everybody leaves capable and war-ready being able to use all of these weapons capably and responsibly. I am now very well trained for jihad in weapons some serious like anti-aircraft missiles.

In January 2001, Hicks was provided with funding and an introductory letter from Lashkar-e-Taiba. He travelled to Afghanistan to attend training. According to Hicks&#x27; autobiography &quot;&quot;, he was unfamiliar with the name Al-Qaeda until after his detainment in Guantanamo Bay.

===Afghanistan===
Upon arrival in Afghanistan, Hicks allegedly went to an al-Qaeda guest house where he met Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, a high-ranking al Qaeda member. He turned over his passport and told them that he would use the alias &quot;Muhammad Dawood&quot; (to protect himself from attack).
Hicks allegedly &quot;attended a number of al-Qaeda training courses at various camps around Afghanistan, learning guerrilla warfare, weapons training, including landmines, kidnapping techniques and assassination methods.&quot; He also allegedly participated &quot;in an advanced course on surveillance, in which he conducted surveillance of the abandoned buildings that had formerly been the US and British embassies in Kabul, Afghanistan.&quot; Hicks was sent to learn guerrilla techniques for the Pakistani L-e-T for use in disputed Kashmir.

Hicks denies any involvement with al-Qaeda. He also denies any knowledge of links between the camp and al-Qaeda. According to Hicks, he did not know of the existence of al-Qaeda until he was taken to Cuba and was interrogated by US military personnel.
On one occasion when al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden visited an Afghan camp, the US Defense Department alleges Hicks questioned bin Laden about the lack of English in training material and subsequently &quot;began to translate the training camp materials from Arabic to English&quot;. Hicks denies this and denies having had the necessary language proficiency, a claim supported by Major Michael Mori and fellow detainee Moazzam Begg. The latter said that Hicks could not speak enough Arabic to be understood. Hicks wrote home that he had met Osama bin Laden 20 times. He later, however, told investigators he had exaggerated, that he had seen bin Laden about eight times and spoken to him only once.
There are a lot of Muslims who want to meet Osama Bin Laden but after being a Muslim for 16 months I get to meet him.
Prosecutors also allege Hicks was interviewed by Mohammed Atef, an al-Qaeda military commander, about his background and &quot;the travel habits of Australians&quot;. In a memoir that was later repudiated by its author, the Guantanamo detainee Feroz Abbasi claimed Hicks was &quot;Al-Qaedah&#x27;s 24 [carat] Golden Boy&quot; and &quot;obviously the favourite recruit&quot; of their al-Qaeda trainers during exercises at the al-Farouq camp near Kandahar. The memoir made a number of claims, including that Hicks was teamed in the training camp with Filipino recruits from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and that, during internment in Camp X-Ray, Hicks allegedly described his desire to &quot;go back to Australia and rob and kill Jews ... crash a plane into a building&quot; and to &quot;go out with that last big adrenaline rush.&quot;

==== September 2001 ====
On 9 September 2001, Hicks travelled from Afghanistan to Pakistan to visit a friend. A US Department of Defense statement claimed that &quot;viewing TV news coverage in Pakistan of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States&quot; led Hicks to return to Afghanistan to &quot;rejoin his al-Qaeda associates to fight against U.S., British, Canadian, Australian, Afghan, and other coalition forces.&quot; Hicks denies this claim in his book. Although the L-e-T offered to provide documentation to allow him to return to Australia, Hicks feared arrest for using false documents. Hicks returned in order to get his passport and birth certificate back so he could travel home to Adelaide.

Hicks arrived in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar where he reported to Saif al Adel, who was assigning individuals to locations, and &quot;armed himself with an AK-47 automatic rifle, ammunition, and grenades to fight against coalition forces.&quot; Hicks was given a choice of three locations and chose to join an alleged group of al-Qaeda fighters defending the Kandahar airport. After Coalition bombing commenced in October 2001, Hicks began guarding a Taliban tank position outside the airport. After guarding the tank for a week, Hicks, with an L-e-T acquaintance, travelled closer to the battle front in Kunduz where he joined others, including John Walker Lindh.

Colonel Morris Davis, chief prosecutor for the US office of Military Commissions, said, &quot;He eventually left Afghanistan and it&#x27;s my understanding was heading back to Australia when 9/11 happened. When he heard about 9/11, he said it was a good thing (and) he went back to the battlefield, back to Afghanistan, and reported in to the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and basically said, &#x27;I&#x27;m David Hicks and I&#x27;m reporting for duty. Davis also compared Hicks&#x27; alleged actions to that of those who carried out terrorist attacks such as the Bali, London and Madrid bombings, and the Beslan school siege. Terry Hicks, said that his son seemed at first unaware, then sceptical, of the 11 September attacks when they spoke on a mobile phone in early November 2001. He also noted David Hicks commented about &quot;going off to Kabul to defend it against the Northern Alliance.&quot;

In October and November 2001, Hicks wrote multiple letters to his mother in Australia. He asked that replies were to be directed to Abu Muslim Austraili, a pseudonym he used to circumvent non-Muslim spies he believed intercepted correspondence. In these letters he detailed the validity of jihad and his own prospect of martyrdom.
As a Muslim young and fit my responsibility is to protect my brothers from aggressive non-believers and not let them destroy it. Islam will rule again but for now we must have patience we are asked to sacrifice our lives for Allahs cause why not? There are many privileges in heaven. It is not just war, it is jihad. One reward I get in being martyred I get to take ten members of my family to heaven who were destined for hell, but first I also must be martyred. We are all going to die one day so why not be martyred?

David Hicks wrote a number of anti Semitic letters during his time in Afghanistan which were published in &quot;The Australian&quot; with statements such as &quot;The Jews have complete financial and media control many of them are in the Australian government&quot; and &quot;The western society is controlled by the Jews&quot;.

In November 2005, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Four Corners&quot; TV program broadcast for the first time a transcript of an interview with Hicks, conducted by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in 2002, and other material, including a report that Hicks had signed a statement written by American military investigators stating that he had trained with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, learning guerrilla tactics and urban warfare. The program also reported that Hicks had met Osama bin Laden and that he claimed to have disapproved of the 11 September attacks but to have been unable to leave Afghanistan. He denied engaging in any actual fighting against US or allied forces and states in his autobiography that he was made to sign the statement under extreme duress.

==Capture and detention==

Hicks was captured by a &quot;Northern Alliance warlord&quot; near Kunduz, Afghanistan, on or about 9 December 2001 and turned over to US Special Forces for US$5000 on 17 December 2001. Hicks&#x27;s father Terry, when interviewed, said &quot;David was captured by the Northern Alliance unarmed in the back of a truck or a van. So he wasn&#x27;t on the battlefield at all.&quot;

In 2002, Hicks&#x27;s father sought to have him brought to Australia for trial. In 2003, the Australian government requested that Hicks be brought to trial without further delay, extending Hicks consular support and legal aid under the Special Circumstances Overseas Scheme.

==Torture allegations==
In an affidavit, dated 5 August 2004 and released on 10 December 2004, Hicks alleged mistreatment by US forces, included being:
* beaten while blindfolded and handcuffed
* forced to take unidentified medication
* sedated by injection without consent
* struck while under sedation
* regularly forced to run in leg shackles causing ankle injury
* deprived of sleep &quot;as a matter of policy&quot;
* sexually assaulted
* witness to use of attack dogs to brutalise and injure detainees.

He also said he met with US military investigators conducting a probe into detainee abuse in Afghanistan and had told the International Red Cross on earlier occasions that he had been mistreated. Hicks told his family in a 2004 visit to Guantanamo Bay that he had been anally assaulted during interrogation by the US in Afghanistan while he was hooded and restrained. Hicks&#x27; father claimed; &quot;He said he was anally penetrated a number of times, they put a bag over his head, he wasn&#x27;t expecting it and didn&#x27;t know what it was. It was quite brutal.&quot; In a &quot;Four Corners&quot; interview, Terry Hicks discussed these &quot;allegations of physical and sexual abuse of his son by American soldiers&quot;.

According to conversations with his father, Hicks said he had been abused by both Northern Alliance and US soldiers. In response, the Australian government announced its acceptance of US assurances that David Hicks had been treated in accordance with international law.

In March 2006, camp authorities moved all ten of the Guantanamo detainees who faced charges into solitary confinement. This was described as a routine measure because of the impending attendance of the detainees at their respective tribunals. Hicks remained in solitary confinement, which was reported to have &quot;deteriorated his condition,&quot; for seven weeks after the US Supreme Court confirmed a ruling that the military commissions were unconstitutional.

Hicks was a &quot;well-behaved detainee&quot;, but was in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. The window in his cell was internal, facing onto a corridor. Hicks claimed to have declined a visit from Australian Consular officials because he had been punished for speaking candidly with consular officials about the conditions of his detention on previous visits. Hicks was talking about suicidal impulses during his periods in isolation at Camp Echo. &quot;He often talked about wanting to smash his head ... against the metal of his cage and just end it all&quot;, Mozzam Begg said.

==Indictment==

===Initial charges===

Hicks was charged by a US military commission on 26 August 2004.

In Guantanamo, Hicks had signed a statement written by American military investigators which read, in part, &quot;I believe that al-Qaeda camps provided a great opportunity for Muslims like myself from all over the world to train for military operations and Jihad. I knew after six months that I was receiving training from al-Qaeda, who had declared war on numerous countries and peoples.&quot; The indictment later prepared by US military prosecutors for his commission trial alleged that, prior to his capture in 2001, Hicks had trained and conspired in various ways and was guilty of &quot;aiding the enemy&quot; while an &quot;unprivileged belligerent&quot; but did not allege any specific acts of violence. The indictment made the following allegations:
* In November 1999, Hicks travelled to Pakistan, where he joined the paramilitary Islamist group, Lashkar-e-Toiba (Army of the Pure).
* Hicks trained for two months at a Lashkar-e-Toiba camp in Pakistan, where he received weapons training and that, during 2000, he served with a Lashkar-e-Toiba group near the Pakistan administered Kashmir.
* In January 2001, Hicks travelled to Afghanistan, then under the control of the Taliban regime, where he presented a letter of introduction from Lashkar-e-Toiba to Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, a senior al-Qaeda member, and was given the alias &quot;Mohammed Dawood&quot;.
* Hicks was sent to al-Qaeda&#x27;s al-Farouq training camp outside Kandahar, where he trained for eight weeks, receiving further weapons training as well as training with land mines and explosives.
* Hicks did a further seven-week course at al-Farouq, during which he studied marksmanship, ambush, camouflage and intelligence techniques.
* At Osama bin Laden&#x27;s request, Hicks translated some al-Qaeda training materials from Arabic into English.
* In June 2001, on the instructions of Mohammed Atef, an al-Qaeda military commander, Hicks went to another training camp at Tarnak Farm, where he studied &quot;urban tactics&quot;, including the use of assault and sniper rifles, rappelling, kidnapping and assassination techniques.
* In August 2001, Hicks went to Kabul, where he studied information collection and intelligence, as well as Islamic theology including the doctrines of &quot;jihad&quot; and martyrdom as understood through al-Qaeda&#x27;s fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.
* In September 2001, Hicks travelled to Pakistan and was there at the time of the 11 September attacks on the United States, which he saw on television.
* Hicks returned to Afghanistan in anticipation of the attack by the United States and its allies on the Taliban regime, which was sheltering Osama bin Laden.
* On returning to Kabul, Hicks was assigned by Mohammed Atef to the defence of Kandahar and that he joined a group of mixed al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters at Kandahar airport. At the end of October, however, Hicks and his party travelled north to join in the fighting against the forces of the US and its allies.
* After arriving in Konduz on 9 November 2001, he joined a group which included John Walker Lindh (the &quot;American Taliban&quot;). This group was engaged in combat against Coalition forces and, during the fighting, he was captured by Coalition forces.

On 29 June 2006, the US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; that the military commissions were illegal under United States law and the Geneva Conventions. The commission trying Hicks was abolished and the charges against him voided.

In an interview with &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper in January 2007, Col. Morris Davis, the chief prosecutor in the Guantanamo military commissions, also alleged that Hicks had been issued with weapons to fight US troops, and had conducted surveillance against US and international embassies. Davis stated he would be charged for these offences, and predicted the charging would take place before the end of January. He alleged that Hicks &quot;knew and associated with a number of al-Qaeda senior leadership&quot; and that &quot;he conducted surveillance on the US embassy and other embassies&quot;. He went on to compare Hicks to the Bali bombers, expressing concern that Australians were misjudging the military commission system due to PR &quot;smoke&quot; from Hicks&#x27;s lawyer.

James Yee, an Islamic US Army chaplain who regularly counselled Hicks while detained at Guantanamo Bay, gave a statement shortly after Hicks was freed in December 2007. He said that he did not feel Hicks was a threat to Australia, and that &quot;Any American soldier who has been through basic training has had 50 times more training than this guy.&quot;

==Trial delays==

===Defence team===
The US Army appointed United States Marine Corps Major Michael Mori as defence counsel to Hicks. Hicks&#x27;s civilian defence was being funded by Dick Smith, an Australian entrepreneur. Smith has stated that he was funding the defence &quot;to get him a fair trial&quot;.

===Delays in legal proceedings===
In November 2004, Hicks&#x27;s trial was delayed when a US Federal Court ruled that the military commissions in question were unconstitutional. In February 2005, the Hicks&#x27;s family lawyer, Stephen Kenny, who had been representing Hicks in Australia without compensation since 2002, was dismissed from the defence team and Vietnam veteran and army reservist David McLeod replaced him.

Hicks&#x27;s trial was next set for 10 January 2005 but there were numerous postponements and further legal wrangling over the years that followed. In mid-February 2005, Jumana Musa, Amnesty International&#x27;s legal observer at Guantanamo Bay, visited Australia to speak to the attorney-general, Philip Ruddock, (a member of Amnesty International) about the military commissions. Musa stated that Australia was &quot;the only country that seems to have come out and said that the idea of trying somebody, their own citizen, before this process might be OK, and I think that should be a concern to anybody.&quot;

In July 2005, a US appeals court accepted the prosecution claim that because &quot;the President of the United States issued a memorandum in which he determined that none of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions apply to our conflict with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world because, among other reasons, al Qaeda is not a high contracting party to Geneva&quot;, that Hicks, among others, could be tried by a military tribunal. In July 2005, the US appeals court ruled that the trial of &quot;Unlawful Combatants&quot; did not come under the Geneva Convention, and that they could be tried by a military tribunal.

In early August 2005, leaked emails from former US prosecutors criticised the legal process, accusing it of being &quot;a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused in a process that appears to be rigged&quot; and &quot;writing a motion saying that the process will be full and fair when you don&#x27;t really believe it is kind of hard, particularly when you want to call yourself an officer and lawyer&quot;. Ruddock responded by saying that the emails, written in March 2004, &quot;must be seen as historic rather than current.&quot; In October 2005, the US government announced that if Hicks was convicted, his pre-trial detention would not count as time served against his sentence.

On 15 November 2005, District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly stayed the proceeding against Hicks until the US Supreme Court had ruled on Hamdan&#x27;s appeal over their constitutionality.

2006 was also fraught with delays. On 29 June 2006, in the case &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;, the US Supreme Court ruled that the military tribunals were illegal under United States law and the Geneva Conventions. On 7 July 2006, a memo was issued from The Pentagon directing that all military detainees are entitled to humane treatment and to certain basic legal standards, as required by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. On 15 August 2006, Attorney-General Philip Ruddock announced that he would seek to return Hicks to Australia if the United States did not proceed quickly to lay substantive new charges. As a result of the Supreme Court decision, the United States Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to provide an alternative method for trying detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. The Act was signed into law by President Bush on 17 October 2006.

On 6 December 2006, Hicks&#x27;s legal team lodged documents with the Federal Court of Australia, arguing that the Australian government had breached its protective duty to Hicks as an Australian citizen in custody overseas, and failed to request that Hicks&#x27;s incarceration by the US comply with the Geneva Convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

On 9 March 2007, his lawyer said that David Hicks was expected to bring a case seeking to force the Australian Federal Government to ask the US government to free him. On 26 March 2007, the television journalist Leigh Sales suggested that Hicks was attempting to avoid trial by military commission, commenting &quot;The Hicks defence strategy relies on delaying the process for so long that the Australian Government will be forced to ask for the prisoner&#x27;s return.&quot;

As years passed, the legitimacy, integrity and fairness of trying Hicks before a US military commission was increasingly questioned.

===British citizenship bid===
In September 2005, it was realised that Hicks may be eligible for British citizenship through his mother, as a consequence of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Hicks&#x27;s British heritage was revealed during a casual conversation with his lawyer, about the 2005 Ashes cricket series. The British government had previously negotiated the release of the nine British nationals incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay, so it was considered possible that these releases could be extended to Hicks if his application was successful.

Hicks applied for citizenship, but there were six months of delays. In November 2005, the British Home Office rejected Hicks&#x27;s application for British citizenship on character grounds, but his lawyers appealed against the decision. On 13 December 2005, Lord Justice Lawrence Collins of the High Court ruled that then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke had &quot;no power in law&quot; to deprive Mr Hicks of British citizenship &quot;and so he must be registered&quot;. The Home Office announced it would take the matter to the Court of Appeal, but Justice Collins denied them a stay of judgement, meaning that the British government must proceed with the application.

On 17 March 2006 the Home Office alleged during its appeal case that Hicks had admitted in 2003 to the Security Service (British intelligence agency MI5) that he had undergone extensive terrorist training in Afghanistan. On 12 April 2006 the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court&#x27;s decision that Hicks was entitled to British citizenship. The Home Office declared it would appeal the matter again, its last option being to submit an appeal to Britain&#x27;s highest court, the House of Lords, no later than 25 April.

On 5 May, however, the Court of Appeal declared that no further appeals would be allowed, and that the Home Office must grant Hicks British citizenship. Hicks&#x27;s legal team claimed in the High Court on 14 June 2006 that the process of Mr Hicks&#x27;s registration as a British citizen had been delayed and obstructed by the United States, which had not allowed British consular access to Hicks in order to conduct the oath of allegiance to the Queen and the United Kingdom. His military lawyer has the authority to administer oaths and offered to conduct the oath if the American government permitted it.

On 27 June, with Hicks&#x27;s British citizenship confirmed, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced that it would not seek to lobby for his release as it had with the other British detainees. The reason given was that Hicks was an Australian citizen when he was captured and detained and that he had received Australian consular assistance. On 5 July 2006 Hicks was registered as a British citizen, albeit only for a few hours — Home Secretary John Reid intervened to revoke Hicks&#x27;s new citizenship almost as soon as it had been granted, citing section 56 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 allowing the Home Secretary to &quot;deprive a person of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good&quot;. Hicks&#x27;s legal team called the decision an &quot;abuse of power&quot;, and announced they would lodge an appeal with the UK Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the High Court.

===Seizure of legal papers===
Following the death of three detainees, camp authorities seized prisoners&#x27; papers. Described as a security measure, it was claimed that instructions for tying a hangman&#x27;s noose had been found written on stationery issued to the lawyers who met with detainees to discuss their habeas corpus requests. The Department of Justice acknowledged in court that &quot;privileged attorney-client communications&quot; had been seized. Hicks&#x27;s lawyer questioned whether Hicks could have been part of a suicide plot, since he had spent the preceding four months in solitary confinement in a different part of the camp, and expressed concern that attorney-client confidentiality, &quot;the last legal right that was being respected&quot;, had been violated.

==New charges==
On 3 February 2007, the US military commission announced that it had prepared new charges against David Hicks. The drafted charges were &quot;attempted murder&quot; and &quot;providing material support for terrorism&quot;, under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The prosecutors said they would argue for a jail term of 20 years, with an absolute minimum of 15 years to be served.

However the sentence, which was not required to take into account time already served, was ultimately up to a panel of US military officers. The Convening Authority assessed whether there was enough evidence for charges to be laid and Hicks tried. The charge of providing material support for terrorism was based on retrospectively applying the law passed in 2006.

On 16 February 2007, a nine-page charge sheet detailing the new charges was officially released by the US Defense Department.

The charge sheets alleged that:
* Around August 2001 Hicks conducted surveillance on the American and British embassies in Kabul.
* Using the name Abu Muslim Austraili he attended al-Qaeda training camps.
* Around April 2001 Hicks returned to al Farouq and trained &quot;in al-Qa&#x27;ida&#x27;s guerilla warfare and mountain tactics training course&quot;. The course included &quot;marksmanship; small team tactics; ambush; camouflage; rendezvous techniques; and techniques to pass intelligence to al-Qa&#x27;ida operatives&quot;.
* While at the al Farouq camp, al-Qa&#x27;ida leader Osama bin Laden visited the camp on several occasions and &quot;during one visit Hicks expressed to bin Laden his concern over the lack of English al-Qa&#x27;ida training material&quot;.
* On or about 12 September 2001 he left Pakistan after watching TV footage of the 11 September terrorist attacks to return to Afghanistan &quot;and, again joined with al-Qa&#x27;ida&quot;.
* On his return to Afghanistan Hicks was issued an AK-47 automatic rifle and armed himself with 300 rounds of ammunition and 3 grenades to use in fighting the United States, Northern Alliance and other coalition forces.
* On or about 9 November 2001 Hicks spent about two hours on the front line at Konduz &quot;before it collapsed and he was forced to flee&quot;.
* Around December 2001, Northern Alliance forces captured Hicks in Baghlan, Afghanistan.

On 1 March 2007, David Hicks was formally charged with material support for terrorism, and referred to trial by the special military commission. The second charge of attempted murder was dismissed by Judge Susan Crawford, who concluded there was &quot;no probable cause&quot; to justify the charge.

In March 2007, the prospect of further delay loomed when Mori was allegedly threatened with court martial for using contemptuous language toward the US executive, a US military discipline offence, by the chief US military prosecutor, Colonel Morris Davis, but no charges were filed against Mori.

Leaders and legal commentators in both countries criticised the prosecution as the application of ex post facto law and deemed the 5-year process to be a violation of Hicks&#x27;s basic rights. The United States countered that the charges relating to Hicks were not retrospective but that the Military Commissions Act had codified offences that had been traditionally tried by military commissions and did not establish any new crimes.

Hick&#x27;s defence lawyer and many international judiciary members claimed that it would have been impossible for a conviction to be found against Hicks. In her book on Hicks, Australian journalist Leigh Sales examines more than five years of reporting and dozens of interviews with insiders, and looks at the intricacies of Hicks&#x27;s case from his capture in Afghanistan to life in Guantanamo Bay, including behind-the-scene establishment and workings of the military commissions.

The Indian government launched an investigation into the attacks by Hicks on their armed forces in Kashmir, during 2000.

==Pre-trial agreement and sentence==
On 26 March 2007, following negotiations with Hicks&#x27;s defence lawyers, the convening authority Judge Susan Crawford directly approved the terms of a pre-trial agreement. The agreement stipulated that Hicks enter an Alford plea to a single charge of providing material support for terrorism in return for a guarantee of a much shorter sentence than had been previously sought by the prosecution. The agreement also stipulated that the five years already spent by Hicks at Guantanamo Bay could not be subtracted from any sentence handed down, that Hicks must not speak to the media for one year nor take legal action against the United States, and that Hicks withdraw allegations that the US military abused him. Accordingly, in the first ever conviction by the Guantanamo military tribunal and the first conviction in a US war crimes trial since World War II, on 31 March, the tribunal handed down a seven-year jail sentence for the charge, suspending all but nine months.

The length of the sentence caused an &quot;outcry&quot; in the United States and against Defense Department lawyer Susan Crawford, who allegedly bypassed the prosecution in order to meet an agreement with the defence made before the trial. Chief prosecutor Colonel Davis was unaware of the plea deal and surprised at the nine-month sentence, telling &quot;The Washington Post&quot; &quot;I wasn&#x27;t considering anything that didn&#x27;t have two digits&quot;, meaning a sentence of at least 10 years.

Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union described the case as &quot;an unwitting symbol of our shameful abandonment of the rule of law&quot;.

===Political manipulation claims===

Australian and US critics speculated that the one-year media ban was a condition requested by the Australian government and granted as a political favour. Senator Bob Brown of the Australian Greens said, &quot;America&#x27;s guarantee of free speech under its constitution would have rendered such a gag illegal in the U.S.&quot; The Law Council of Australia reported that the trial was &quot;a contrived affair played out for the benefit of the media and the public&quot;, &quot;designed to lay a veneer of due process over a political and pragmatic bargain&quot;, serving to corrode the rule of law. They referred to government support for the military tribunal process as shameful. In an interview, the prominent human rights lawyer and UN war crimes judge Geoffrey Robertson QC said that the pre-trial agreement &quot;was obviously an expedient at the request of an Australian Government that needed to shore up votes&quot;. He went on to note that &#x27;no one looks on [the agreement] as a proper judicial procedure at all.&#x27;;

The Pentagon chief prosecutor Colonel Morris Davis, who had resigned from the US defence force citing dissatisfaction with the Guantanamo military commission process, alleged that the process had become highly politicised and that he had felt &quot;pressured to do something less than full, fair and open&quot;. Davis later elaborated, saying that the Hicks trial was flawed and appeared rushed for the political benefit of the Howard government in Australia. Davis said of his former superiors that &quot;there is no question they wanted me to stage show trials that have nothing to do with the centuries-old tradition of military justice in America&quot;. On 28 April 2008, while testifying at a pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo for Salim Hamdan, Colonel Davis said that he had &quot;inherited&quot; the Hicks case but did not consider it serious enough to warrant prosecution.

In November 2007, allegations from an anonymous US military officer, that a high-level political agreement had occurred in the Hicks case, were reported. The officer said that &quot;one of our staffers was present when Vice-President Cheney interfered directly to get Hicks&#x27;s plea bargain deal. He did it apparently, as part of a deal cut with Howard&quot;. Australian Prime Minister John Howard denied any involvement in Hicks&#x27;s plea bargain.

The Australian government denied that the media ban had anything to do with itself or the nearing 2007 Australian federal election, with Prime Minister Howard saying &quot;We did not impose the sentence, the sentence was imposed by the military commission and the plea bargain was worked out between the military prosecution and Mr Hicks&#x27;s lawyers, and the suggestion ... that it&#x27;s got something to do with the Australian election is absurd.&quot; Brigadier-General Thomas Hemingway, the legal adviser to the military tribunal convening authority, has since claimed the gag order as his idea. Federal Attorney-General Philip Ruddock stated that Australian law would not prohibit Hicks from speaking to media, although Hicks would be prevented from selling his story.

==Repatriation, release and charge ruled invalid==
On 20 May 2007, Hicks arrived at RAAF Base Edinburgh in Adelaide, South Australia on a chartered flight reported to have cost the Australian government up to A$500,000. Attorney-General Philip Ruddock asserted that this arrangement was the consequence of US restrictions on the transit of Hicks through US airspace or territory preventing the use of less expensive commercial flights. Hicks was taken to Adelaide&#x27;s Yatala Labour Prison where he was kept in solitary confinement in the state&#x27;s highest-security ward, G Division.

Hicks was released on 29 December 2007 and placed under a control order obtained by the AFP earlier that month. The order required Hicks to not leave Australia, to report to a police station three times a week, and to use only an AFP-approved mobile phone SIM card. On 19 February 2008 he was given special dispensation by federal magistrate Warren Donald to leave South Australia. On 20 February 2008, Hicks moved to Abbotsford, New South Wales. A curfew between 1:00 am and 5:00 am was imposed. Hicks&#x27; control order expired in December 2008 and the AFP did not renew it.

Hicks married Aloysia Hicks, a human rights activist who studied at the University of Sydney. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Michael Mori, one of his former military attorneys, attended the ceremony. It was also reported that Dick Smith secured employment for Hicks in a Sydney landscape gardening business.

During 2010, there were calls for Hicks to commence action to clear his name of the charges. In May 2011 his father, wife and supporters, including former politician and justice John Dowd, former Human Rights Commissioner Elizabeth Evatt, human rights lawyer Julian Burnside, along with others started a campaign to clear Hicks&#x27; name and to push for an inquiry into his alleged mistreatment in Guantanamo.
Their campaign launch featured Brandon Neely, a former US soldier who guarded Hicks in Guantanamo.

In October 2012, the United States Court of Appeals ruled that the charge under which Hicks had been convicted was invalid, because the law did not exist at the time of the alleged offence, and it could not be applied retrospectively.
The efforts of the US to charge Hicks have been described as &quot;a significant departure from the Geneva Conventions and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, quite apart from the US constitution&quot;, the implications being that &quot;anyone in the world, who has suitable radical connections and who is in a war zone fighting against Americans, is guilty of a war crime&quot;.

Propublica obtained a copy of Guantanamo&#x27;s Chief Prosecutor, Mark S. Martins opposition to Hicks&#x27;s motion to have his charges dropped.
His reply advised that Hicks&#x27;s motion shouldn&#x27;t be considered, on the grounds he had pleaded guilty. However, Raymond Bonner, writing in the &quot;Pacific Standard&quot;, reported that Martins&#x27;s reply made the &quot;crucial concession&quot; that &quot;if the appeal were allowed, &#x27;the Court should not confirm Hicks&#x27;s material-support conviction.

===Autobiography===
On 16 October 2010, Random House Australia published an autobiography of Hicks, entitled &quot;&quot;. Hicks said: &quot;This is the first time I have had the opportunity to tell my story publicly. I hope readers find the book is not only a story of injustice, but also one of hope.&quot; Early reviews of the book were relatively praising of its literary merit. The book was originally not available in US bookstores, nor for sale in online booksellers to US readers.

Australia&#x27;s proceeds of crime law prevents convicted criminals profiting from describing their crimes. At the time of publication, Nikki Christer, a spokesperson for Random House, refused to comment whether Hicks was being paid for the book or whether the publisher or the author are at risk of falling foul of federal proceeds of crime laws. Christer said that Random House&#x27;s financial arrangements with its authors were confidential. ABC News quoted George Williams, a legal expert from the University of New South Wales, who said &quot;You can&#x27;t proceed unless you actually know that Hicks is profiting. Unless that can be shown, then there&#x27;s no basis to make an order against him.&quot; ABC News noted that his conviction might be overturned, in which case he would be free to receive royalties. By July 2011, Australia&#x27;s Director of Public Prosecutions announced that legal proceedings against Hicks had commenced in the Supreme Court of New South Wales under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and that a family trust into which the book sales were being paid was frozen. Legal experts believe the prosecutions case will fail. In 2004, federal proceeds of crime laws were amended to include offences covered by the US military commission, in order to prevent Hicks from profiting. As the military commission that convicted Hicks was found to be invalid, in 2011 the amendment was repealed and the existing federal proceeds of crime legislation no longer applies, although the DPP believes the federal law is still broad enough to cover Hicks. South Australia still has laws preventing Hicks from profiting, but these may not apply in regard to a trial that did not satisfy the principles of natural justice and an attempt to apply them to Hicks could, according to Williams, end up in the High Court as a major constitutional challenge.

Following the publication of his autobiography, Hicks received a standing ovation from an audience of 900 people at his first public appearance at the Sydney Writers&#x27; Festival in May 2011.

On 23 July 2012, the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that the case against Hicks had been dropped, as documentary evidence such as Hicks&#x27; guilty plea and other admissions may not be admissible in court due to the circumstances in which they were obtained. Hicks&#x27; legal team argued that they were made under &quot;instances of severe beatings, sleep deprivation and other conditions of detention that contravene international human rights norms.&quot;
Another reason to drop was that Hicks had made an &quot;Alford plea&quot;, which Australia does not recognise. The Commonwealth has been ordered to pay Hicks&#x27; court costs. Outside court, Hicks claimed that the decision had cleared his name. Prime Minister Julia Gillard refused to comment on whether the decision meant Hicks&#x27; name had been cleared, saying it was a decision independent of government. Hicks&#x27; autobiography is believed to have sold 30,000 copies, generating around $10,000 in royalties.

=== Play ===
In 2003, Chris Tugwell wrote a stage play called &quot;X-Ray&quot;, about the plight of David Hicks, as he was being held in Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Hicks&#x27; family was consulted for the play, with many of the vignettes based on the few letters they received from Mr Hicks during the first two years of his imprisonment.

The play was named the &quot;sensation&quot; of the 2004 Adelaide Fringe and the &quot;highlight&quot; of the 2005 Darwin Festival. A US production opened in November 2005. A radio adaptation, commissioned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, went to air on Radio National&#x27;s Airplay in November 2004 and was repeated in the 2005 and 2006 summer seasons. The radio adaptation was awarded the bronze medal for Best Drama Special at the New York Festival&#x27;s 2006 International Radio Awards.

<text>Malatesta da Verucchio (1212–1312) was the founder of the powerful Italian Malatesta family and a notable &quot;condottiero.&quot; He was born in Verucchio. He was the son of Malatesta della Penna (1183–1248).

==Biography==
He was the leader of the Guelphs in Romagna and became &quot;podestà&quot; (chief magistrate) of Rimini in 1239. In 1295, he made himself the undisputed ruler of Rimini by killing the chief members of the rival Ghibelline family, the Parcitati, including their leader Montagna. 

His eldest son was Giovanni Malatesta, famous for the 1285 tragedy, recorded in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, in which he killed his wife Francesca da Polenta and his younger brother Paolo, having discovered them in adultery. 

He was succeeded as seignior of Rimini by his sons, first by Malatestino and later by Pandolfo I.

<text>State Route 525 (SR 525) is a state highway located in Snohomish and Island counties in the western region of the U.S. state of Washington. SR 525 begins at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) and I-405 in Lynnwood and travels north to SR 99 as a four-lane controlled-access freeway. From Lynnwood, the highway serves Mukilteo and becomes the terminus of SR 526 before taking its ferry route to Clinton on Whidbey Island. SR 525 traverses the island&#x27;s interior as part of the Whidbey Island Scenic Byway before the designation ends at an intersection with SR 20 south of Coupeville.

SR 525 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Secondary State Highway 1D (SSH 1D) on Whidbey Island and SSH 1I in Mukilteo and Lynnwood, themselves established in 1937. The highway, at its codification in 1970, traversed the north–south length of Whidbey Island and ended at SR 536 near Anacortes until it was replaced by SR 20 in 1973. SR 525 was converted to its present freeway in Lynnwood during the 1980s and widened to four lanes during the late 1990s, including an overpass over SR 99. The highway also has a spur route in Mukilteo that has connected SR 525 to SR 526 via Paine Field Boulevard since it was signed in 2001.

==Route description==
SR 525 begins at the Swamp Creek Interchange with I-5, also serving as the northern terminus of I-405, located in Lynnwood in southern Snohomish County. The four-lane controlled-access freeway travels north past Alderwood Mall and a partial cloverleaf interchange with Alderwood Mall Parkway, which serves the eponymous mall. SR 525 continues north under overpasses carrying 164th Street and 148th Street before reaching its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 99, where the freeway ends. The highway becomes the four-lane Mukilteo Speedway and travels northwest into the city of Mukilteo, serving its commercial and industrial areas located south of Paine Field. SR 525 intersects its spur route, which travels north as Paine Field Boulevard towards the Boeing Everett Factory, before it serves as the western terminus of SR 526. The highway gains a ferry holding lane on its northbound shoulder as it approaches the Mukilteo ferry terminal, where the designation of SR 525 is carried onto the Whidbey Island Ferry across Possession Sound. The terminal is east of Mukilteo Lighthouse Park and adjacent to a train station served by Sounder commuter trains.

The Mukilteo–Clinton ferry, operated by Washington State Ferries (WSF), takes approximately 20 minutes for each of its 39 daily round-trip crossings. , WSF charges a fare of $5.05 per walk-on passenger and $8.95 per vehicle during off-peak seasons, with varying fares depending on passenger age and vehicle size. SR 525 leaves the ferry terminal at Clinton and travels west through the interior of Whidbey Island in unincorporated Island County as part of the Whidbey Island Scenic Byway, a state scenic byway. The highway turns north along Holmes Harbor in Freeland and continues through Greenbank before SR 525 terminates at SR 20 south of Coupeville and the Naval Outlying Landing Field Coupeville.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 525 was its southern terminus at I-5 and I-405, serving 61,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section of the highway was at the Mukilteo ferry terminal, serving 5,700 vehicles. SR 525 is designated as part of the National Highway System from Lynnwood to the Mukilteo ferry terminal, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. WSDOT designates the entire route of SR 525 as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington.

==History==
SR 525 uses the Whidbey Island Ferry between Mukilteo and Clinton, which began as a route of the Island Transportation Company in 1919. The ferry was later taken over by the Puget Sound Navigation Company, later sold to the state government in 1951 to form the WSF. The Mukilteo and Whidbey Island highways were added to the state highway system in 1937 as SSH 1D and SSH 1I, both branches of PSH 1. SSH 1D traveled on Whidbey and Fidalgo islands from the Clinton ferry dock to an intersection with the Anacortes branch of PSH 1 at Sharps Corner. It was later realigned on Whidbey Island in October 1959. SSH 1I traveled in a circular arc from Everett to Lynnwood, traveling on Mukilteo Boulevard and the Mukilteo Speedway.

SR 525 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering and codified in 1970 as the successor to both SSH 1D and SSH 1I. The highway was extended south and east from Highway 99 to the newly-completed I-5 in February 1965, using 164th Street NE until a new freeway could be constructed. The highway was truncated from Anacortes to its present terminus south of Coupeville after SR 20 was extended across the state on the North Cascades Highway in 1973. SR 525 was re-aligned onto a two-lane freeway between SR 99 and the Swamp Creek in the 1980s, extending the route to I-405. The Swamp Creek Interchange itself was completed in November 1984.

WSF ferry routes were added to its respective state highways in 1994, eliminating one of two gaps along the route of SR 525, the other being a concurrency with SR 99 that was replaced by a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2000 during the widening of the freeway segment in Lynnwood. A spur route, located completely in Mukilteo, was added to SR 525 in 2001 along the route of the four-lane Paine Field Boulevard, connecting the main highway to SR 526.

The Mukilteo ferry terminal, originally completed in 1957, was replaced by a new facility that opened on December 29, 2020. The new terminal, which includes a waiting area, longer car queues, and a transit center, cost $187 million to construct.

In April 2024, Mukilteo mayor Joe Marine floated the idea of renaming Mukilteo Speedway during a work session with the city council to better reflect the city&#x27;s history; it was axed two months later after it received overwhelming opposition among participants in an online survey and a Facebook post soliciting feedback.

==Major intersections==





==Spur route==
SR 525 has a spur route on Paine Field Boulevard in Mukilteo that connects the northbound lanes of the Mukilteo Speedway to SR 526 eastbound towards Everett and the local Boeing factory. Paine Field Boulevard was constructed as part of compensation for Boeing&#x27;s expansion of the Everett factory to accommodate the 777 program in the 1990s; a bypass of the 84th Street section of SR 526 was selected in lieu of expanding SR 525. The new highway was opened in 1999 and signed as SR 525 Spur in 2001. It was subsequently widened and improved in 2003 by WSDOT. A proposal to extend Paine Field Boulevard through Japanese Gulch and create a bypass of the Mukilteo ferry terminal has been a part of the city&#x27;s transportation plan since 2001, but has not been built. WSDOT estimated, during its annual AADT survey, that 21,000 vehicles used the highway in 2012.

<doc id="946217" wikidata="Q3309072" url="?curid=946217" title="Cherokee Outlet">
<text>The Cherokee Outlet, or Cherokee Strip, was located in what is now the state of Oklahoma in the United States. It was a parcel of land south of the Oklahoma–Kansas border between 96 and 100°W. The Cherokee Outlet was created in 1836. The United States forced the Cherokee Nation of Indians to cede to the United States all lands east of the Mississippi River in exchange for a reservation and an &quot;outlet&quot; in Indian Territory (later Oklahoma). At the time of its creation, the Cherokee Outlet was about long. The cities of Enid, Woodward, Ponca City, and Perry were later founded within the boundaries of what had been the Cherokee Outlet.

The Cherokee Strip was a wide piece of land running along the northern border of much of the Cherokee Outlet. It was the result of a surveying error. The whole of the Cherokee Outlet is often called the Cherokee Strip.

==Creation==
In 1836, the Treaty of New Echota between the Cherokees and the United States obligated the Cherokees to move west of the Mississippi River to lands assigned them in Indian Territory (later Oklahoma). Their new lands included a 7.0-million-acre reservation and &quot;a perpetual outlet west...as far west as the sovereignty of the United States&quot; extended. The parcel of land extending west from the Cherokee reservation became known as the Cherokee Outlet. Under the terms of the treaty, the lands ceded to the Cherokees would &quot;in no future time be included within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any State or Territory&quot; and the Cherokees were promised a land patent verifying their ownership of the land.

In 1838, in what is called the Cherokee removal or Trail of Tears, most of the Cherokees, living primarily in northern Georgia, were forcibly relocated to Indian territory and their new lands. A census in 1835 had counted 16,500 Cherokees.

==The Civil War and its aftermath==
The Cherokee Outlet was little used for decades after its creation. The Cherokees were farmers rather than ranchers or hunters, but the nomadic and warlike Plains Indians recognized no ownership of the outlet except by themselves, and used the outlet for hunting. They resisted encroachments on their range, whether by Whites or other Indians. Consequently, only a few Cherokees took advantage of the outlet to the west of their homes for hunting or to graze cattle. With the coming of the American Civil War in 1861, the Cherokees and other Indians living in Indian Territory were divided between support for the Union and the Confederate States of America. A substantial number of Cherokees were slave owners. The census of 1835 counted 1,592 slaves among the Cherokees and 7.4% of Cherokees were slave owners. The attraction of Cherokees toward the Confederacy was magnified by a statement in fall 1860 by William Seward, a prominent supporter of Unionist presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, who said that the Cherokees and other Indians should be expelled from Indian Territory and relocated.

After the American Civil War, the United States demanded a new treaty (see Reconstruction Treaties) to punish the Cherokees because of the support of many of them for the Confederacy. The new treaty (ratified on July 19, 1866) required the Cherokee to sell land in the Cherokee Outlet to other Indian tribes and to allow them to move into and live in the Outlet. The price for the land was to be negotiated with the U.S. president deciding on a price if one could not be agreed to by the Cherokee and the Indian tribes wishing to buy the land.

Meanwhile, the Indian peoples in neighboring Kansas came under intense pressure from the U.S. government and White settlers. With new lands available to them in the Cherokee Outlet, the various Indian people living in Kansas were induced by the U.S. to sell their lands and to purchase new lands in the Cherokee Outlet. The Osage moved to lands (now Osage County, Oklahoma) in the Cherokee Outlet in 1872, followed shortly by the Kaw, Nez Perce, Otoe-Missouria, Pawnee, Ponca, and Tonkawa. The Osage had enough in funds (managed by the U.S. government) to pay for their new lands in the Cherokee Outlet; the U.S. government failed to pay for the land sold to the other tribes until the 1880s, and then paid less than the price asked by the Cherokees.

The practical impact of this settlement of non-Cherokee Indians in the eastern portion of the Cherokee Outlet was to cut the Cherokee off from easy access to the western part of the outlet, thus making it &quot;virtually useless&quot; to them.

==Cattle grazing==

In 1865, mixed-blood Cherokee Jesse Chisholm laid out the Chisholm Trail from Texas to Kansas, and the next year, the first large cattle herd was driven through the Cherokee Outlet from Texas to the railroad in Abilene, Kansas. The Chisholm Trail passed through the present city of Enid and entered Kansas near Caldwell. Cattle drives following the Chisholm Trail, and numerous side trails continued to pass through the outlet for the next 20 years. The Cherokees collected, but with difficulty, 10 cents per head of cattle passing through the outlet.

The Texans began to halt in the outlet to graze and winter their cattle. Ranchers in Kansas also began to use the outlet for grazing their herds. The Cherokees attempted to collect fees for grazing rights, which were confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1878, but collection of the fees was difficult. In 1880, cattlemen, mostly Kansans, formed the Cherokee Strip Livestock Association to manage a chaotic situation in the outlet. After the incorporation of the association in Kansas in 1883, the Cherokees negotiated a five-year lease of the outlet to the association for $100,000 per year. At the end of five years, the Cherokee Tribal Council put the lease up for bid, hoping to get a better price, and leased it again to the Cherokee Strip Livestock Association for $200,000 annually. The more than 100 members of the Livestock Association divided up the land, erecting fences and corrals and building ranch houses.

Also during the 1880s, Captain Bill McDonald, acting as deputy U.S. marshal for the Southern District of Kansas and the Northern District of Texas, cleared the Cherokee Outlet of cattle thieves and train robbers, who had taken to hiding out in what they thought was a kind of &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot;.

==Boomers==
The lease to the Cherokee Strip Livestock Association was nullified by Congress in 1890, which then authorized purchasing the land from the Cherokees for $1.25 per acre. Having previously rejected a bid from the cattlemen to buy the land for $3.00 per acre, the Cherokee protested in vain that the government price was too low. President Benjamin Harrison forbade all grazing in the Cherokee Outlet after October 2, 1890, which eliminated all profit from leasing the land. After that, the Cherokee sold off the land at prices ranging from $1.40 to $2.50 per acre. The Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association disbanded in 1893, the same year the outlet was opened to non-Indian settlement.

Actual payment did not occur until 1964, when the Cherokee finally settled their claims against the U.S. government for the actual value of the Cherokee Strip land opened to settlement in 1893. This amounted to about $14.7 million, which was paid to the original allotment holders or their heirs. The tribe also received an additional $2 million in accrued interest.

The Organic Act of 1890 incorporated the unassigned lands into the new Oklahoma Territory. Oklahoma became the 46th state on November 16, 1907.

==Cherokee Strip land run==
In 1889, Congress authorized the Cherokee Commission to persuade the Cherokee to cede their complete title to the Cherokee Outlet. After a great amount of pressure, and confirmed by a treaty Congress approved March 17, 1893, the Cherokee agreed, for &quot;the sum of $8,595,736.12, over and above all other sums&quot; to turn title over to the United States government. On September 16, 1893, the eastern end of the Cherokee Outlet was settled in the Cherokee Strip land run, the largest land run in the United States and possibly the largest event of its kind in history.

==In popular fiction==
The Cherokee Outlet and the actions of the cattlemen play a prominent role in a portion of the Matt Braun Western novel &quot;The Kincaids&quot;. The names of the characters have been changed, but the basic actions taken are explored. The 1897 land run serves as the setting of films such as 1925&#x27;s &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; starting William S. Hart and 1939&#x27;s &quot;The Oklahoma Kid&quot; starring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. In Mark Twain&#x27;s 1896 comic novel “The American Claimant,” the naive character Washington Hawkins arrives in Washington, D.C., upon being appointed the Congressional delegate for the Cherokee Strip.

<text>Eprosartan, sold under the brand name Teveten among others, is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for the treatment of high blood pressure.

Eprosartan is sometimes paired with hydrochlorothiazide.

As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, eprosartan is generally better tolerated than enalapril (an ACE inhibitor), especially among the elderly.

== History ==
The compound came into the Abbott Laboratories cardiovascular pipeline with its acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals in 2006, which had licensed it, along with &quot;a range of hypertensive treatments&quot;, from the Biovail Corporation.

<text>Ann Ronell (née Rosenblatt; December 25, 1905 – December 25, 1993) was an American composer and lyricist. She was best known for the standards &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot; (1932) and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf&quot; (1933).

==Early life==
Ronell was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to Morris and Mollie Rosenblatt, and graduated from Omaha&#x27;s Central High School in 1923. She enrolled in Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, but transferred after her sophomore year to pursue a serious music education. She graduated from Radcliffe College, where she studied music under Walter Piston. While at Radcliffe, Ronell wrote music for college plays and contributed reviews and interviews to the school&#x27;s music publication. After interviewing George Gershwin, she struck up a friendship with the composer, who hired her as a rehearsal pianist for his show &quot;Rosalie&quot;. Gershwin suggested that she change her name from Rosenblatt to Ronell.

==Music career==
Ronell was, along with Dorothy Fields, Dana Suesse, and Kay Swift, one of the first successful Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley female composers or librettists. In 1929 she put her first song in a show, &quot;Down By the River.&quot; In 1930, she wrote her first hit, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Birthday Party.&quot; Originally written for a musical, Ronell shopped the song around several music publishers to no avail until Famous Music agreed to publish it. In 1932, she produced the two more songs that gained her notoriety, &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Willow Weep for Me,&quot; the latter of which she dedicated to George Gershwin.

In 1933, Ronell moved to Hollywood. There, she cowrote Disney&#x27;s first hit song, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot; with Frank Churchill for the cartoon &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; (1933). She was notable for being one of the only composers at the time to handle both music and lyrics.

She wrote the lyrics and music for the Broadway musical &quot;Count Me In&quot; (1942) She wrote songs for movies including &quot;Champagne Waltz&quot; (1937) and &quot;Blockade&quot; (1938) and wrote the scores for movies including the Lester Cowan-produced &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; (1945), the film adaptation of the Weill/Nash musical &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (1948), and the Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;Love Happy&quot; (1949). She served as musical director for &quot;Main Street to Broadway&quot; (1953). She was nominated for Best Song, &quot;Linda,&quot; and with co-composer Louis Applebaum for Best Score, for her work on &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot;.

==Legacy==
Ronell&#x27;s work scoring films was influential in the field. Her score for &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; was the first drama to feature a theme song sung over the credits. She was also the first to produce a record from a film score, which she did with &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot;. In 1942, Ronell became the first woman to write both the music and lyrics for a broadway show with &quot;Count Me In&quot;.

&quot;Willow Weep for Me,&quot; Ronell&#x27;s most famous song, has been recorded by such notable artists as Billie Holiday, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson, Dinah Washington, Ray Charles, Lena Horne, Julie London, Tony Bennett, Sarah Vaughan, June Christy, and Chad &amp; Jeremy, whose version became a top 20 single hit in 1965.

==Family==

<text>The Unassigned Lands in Oklahoma were in the center of the lands ceded to the United States by the Creek (Muskogee) and Seminole Indians following the Civil War and on which no other tribes had been settled. By 1883, it was bounded by the Cherokee Outlet on the north, several relocated Indian reservations on the east, the Chickasaw lands on the south, and the Cheyenne-Arapaho reserve on the west. The area amounted to . 

In 1889, this territory was offered by the federal government to non-Native Americans for settlement in the Oklahoma Land Rush.

==Indian era==
The Treaty of Indian Springs, February 12, 1825, provided for a delegation of Creeks to visit the west in order that

they may select any other territory, west of the Mississippi, on Red, Canadian, Arkansas, or Missouri Rivers

to replace their lands in Georgia. A dispute arose between the Lower Creek Council, which signed the treaty, and the Upper Creek Council, which objected. The dispute led to the killing of General William McIntosh, the chief of the Lower Creeks, and left the treaty in doubt. Despite that, the Creeks were relocated to the west. On February 14, 1833, the Treaty of Okmulgee was signed at Fort Gibson. In it the Creeks finally agreed to cede their lands in the east. Article 2 of the 1833 treaty defined the land chosen under the 1825 treaty as being west and south of the Cherokee lands and bordering the Canadian River on the south and what was then the Mexican border on the west.

In the Seminole Treaty signed March 28, 1833, but not ratified, the Seminole agreed to settle on the Little River portion of the Creek lands in Indian Territory. Some Seminole moved but the rest retreated within Florida. The US tried again to remove them, resulting in the Second Seminole War. After the Second War, most of the Seminole moved to the Indian Territory. A treaty between the Creek and the Seminole tribes, ratified August 16, 1856 by the US Senate, gave the Seminole the agreed-upon tract of Creek land between the Canadian River on the south and the North Fork of the Canadian River on the north.

The divisions within the Creek people continued up through the Civil War. The Council, then under control of the Lower Creek, signed a treaty of support with the Confederacy on July 10, 1861. Creek support for the South was not unanimous, however. After a series of armed confrontations, Opothleyahola&#x27;s pro-Union Creeks, belonging mostly to the Upper Creek, were driven into Kansas during the winter of 1861–62. They suffered a huge loss of life, as did their limited number of Seminole allies under Halleck Tustenuggee.

When the Confederacy lost the Civil War, the United States forced the Creek nation into a new treaty, and forced them to cede some lands in compensation for having supported the wrong side. Under Article 3 of the 1866 Creek Treaty, the Creek agreed to cede the western portion of their lands

In compliance with the desire of the United States to locate other Indians and freedmen thereon, the Creeks hereby cede and convey to the United States, to be sold to and used as homes for such other civilized Indians as the United States may choose to settle thereon ... the west half of their entire domain ... [for] ... the sum of thirty (30) cents per acre ($74.13/km2), amounting to nine hundred and seventy-five thousand one hundred and sixty-eight dollars ...

The Seminoles&#x27; active support of the Confederacy cost them much more land than it did the Creeks. Article 3 of the Seminole Treaty, ratified July 19, 1866, required that

the Seminoles cede and convey to the United States their entire domain ... [for] ... the sum of three hundred and twenty-five thousand three hundred and sixty-two ($325,362) dollars, said purchase being at the rate of fifteen cents per acre ($37.07/km2).

By the same treaty, the Seminole were the first tribe relocated to the ceded Creek land. Several tribes of Eastern Indians were also moved to the eastern end of the ceded Creek land. The Absentee Shawnee and Citizen Band of Pottawatomi shared a reserve; also, the Sac and Fox. Later, the Kickapoo were moved in and, lastly, the Iowa. The combined Cheyenne Arapaho tribe was given the western end of the Creek and Seminole land, along with some land ceded from the other tribes. Most of the former Creek and Seminole land, as was true for the rest of central and western Indian Territory, was already leased from the Indian tribes for grazing by large cattle ranching companies.

==Pro-settlement campaign==
In about 1879, Elias C. Boudinot began a campaign, perhaps at the behest of one of his clients, the M–K–T Railroad, to open the land &quot;unoccupied by any Indian&quot; to settlement by non-Indians. He pointed out in a letter published in 1879 that four of the Five Civilized Tribes, unlike the Cherokee, had extinguished their complete title to the lands ceded following the Civil War and received full payment. 

He also said:
Whatever may have been the desire or intention of the United States Government in 1866 to locate Indians and negroes upon these lands, it is certain that no such desire or intention exists in 1879. The Negro since that date, has become a citizen of the United States, and Congress has recently enacted laws which practically forbid the removal of any more Indians into the Territory.He suggested that the area was now Public Land and suggested the names &quot;Unassigned Lands&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot; for the district.

In an attempt to prevent encroachment, President Rutherford B. Hayes issued a proclamation on April 26, 1879, forbidding trespass into the area
which Territory is designated, organized, and described by treaties and laws of the United States and by executive authorities as the Indian&#x27;s country ...

It was too late. Almost immediately speculators and landless citizens began organizing and agitating for the opening of the land to settlement. The newspapers generally referred to these pro-settlement forces as &quot;Boomers&quot; and followed Boudinot&#x27;s lead in referring to the area as the Unassigned Lands or Oklahoma.

The Boomers planned excursions, which they called raids, into the area and surveyed townsites, built homes, and planted crops. The United States sent troops to round them up and expel them. The raids continued for several years. The Boomers tried to get a legal opinion as to the status of the public lands, but the government, instead of charging them for illegal settlement of Indian land, charged them only under the Intercourse Act. Finally, in &quot;United States vs. Payne&quot; in 1884, the United States District Court at Topeka, Kansas ruled that settling on the Unassigned Lands was not a criminal offense.

The government refused to accept the decision and continued to raid the squatters. Finally General Pleasant Porter, the Creek Council&#x27;s delegate to Washington, offered to relinquish all Creek claims to that part of the ceded territory which remained unassigned. On January 31, 1889, the United States and the Creek agreed to quit any claims to title of the land. The Creek received approximately $2,250,000.

==Settlement and statehood==
The Springer Amendment was immediately added to the Indian Appropriation Act of 1889 to authorize settlement under the provisions of the Homestead Act of 1862. The amendment, however, denied the settlers their squatter&#x27;s rights. The lands were to be settled by a land run. The original settlers were rounded up and expelled. 

On April 22, 1889, the Oklahoma lands were settled by what would later be called the Run of &#x27;89. Over 50,000 people entered on the first day, among them several thousand freedmen and descendants of slaves. Tent cities were erected overnight at Oklahoma City, Kingfisher, El Reno, Norman, Guthrie and Stillwater, which was the first of the settlements.

Federal troops of the United States Army provided law enforcement; the closest criminal and civil jurisdictions were the federal courts of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, with its courthouse centered in the border town to the east of Fort Smith, Arkansas. Despite that, the district and territory was generally peaceful with its longtime infamous federal judge Isaac C. Parker (1838-1896), and a posse of his United States deputy marshals. Most land disputes were settled without bloodshed, although a few took years to resolve.

The passage of the Organic Act of 1890 by the United States Congress, signed by 23rd President Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901, served 1889-1893), incorporated the former western Unassigned Lands into the newly organized federal Oklahoma Territory, (which endured 17 years until 46th statehood in 1907). Under the congressional act, local officials were appointed to handle civil and criminal matters until elections were held. Under the later Curtis Act of 1898, the communal lands of the Five Civilized Tribes in the adjacent Indian Territory to the east, were allocated to registered heads of households, thus extinguishing tribal title. The federal government declared any excess lands as &quot;surplus&quot; and allowed sale to non-Native Americans. In 1907, the new State of Oklahoma (the merger of the full Indian Territory and former Oklahoma Territory areas) was admitted as the 46th state in the American Union.

<text>SmarterChild was a chatbot available on AOL Instant Messenger and Windows Live Messenger (previously MSN Messenger) networks.

==History==
SmarterChild was an intelligent agent or &quot;bot&quot; developed by ActiveBuddy, Inc., with offices in New York and Sunnyvale. It was widely distributed across global instant messaging networks. SmarterChild became very popular, attracting over 30 million Instant Messenger &quot;buddies&quot; on AIM (AOL), MSN and Yahoo Messenger over the course of its lifetime.

Founded in 2000, ActiveBuddy was the brainchild of Robert Hoffer and Timothy Kay, who later brought seasoned advertising executive Peter Levitan on board as CEO. The concept for conversational instant messaging bots came from the founder&#x27;s vision to add natural language comprehension functionality to the increasingly popular AIM instant messaging application. The original implementation took shape as a demo that Kay programmed in Perl in his Los Altos garage to connect a single buddy name, &quot;ActiveBuddy&quot;, to look up stock symbols, and later allow AIM users to play Colossal Cave Adventure, a word-based adventure game, and MIT&#x27;s Boris Katz Start Question Answering System but quickly grew to include a wide range of database applications the company called &#x27;knowledge domains&#x27; including instant access to news, weather, stock information, movie times, yellow pages listings, and detailed sports data, as well as a variety of tools (personal assistant, calculators, translator, etc.). None of the individual domains which the company had named “stocksBuddy”, “sportsBuddy”, etc. ever launched publicly. When Stephen Klein came on board as COO — and eventually CEO — he insisted that all of the disparate test “buddies” be launched together with the company’s highly-developed colloquial chat domain. He suggested using “SmarterChild”, a username coined by Tim Kay which Tim was using to test various things. The bundled domains were launched publicly as SmarterChild (on AIM initially) in June 2001. SmarterChild provided information wrapped in fun and quirky conversation. The company generated no revenue from SmarterChild, but used it as a demonstration of the power of what Klein called “conversational computing”. The company subsequently marketed Automated Service Agents—delivering immediate answers to customer service inquiries—-to large corporations, like Comcast, Cingular, TimeWarner Cable, etc.

SmarterChild&#x27;s popularity spawned targeted marketing-oriented bots for Radiohead, Austin Powers, Intel, Keebler, The Sporting News and others. ActiveBuddy co-founders, Kay and Hoffer, as co-inventors, were issued two controversial U.S. patents in 2002.

ActiveBuddy changed its name to Colloquis (briefly Conversagent) and targeted development of consumer-facing enterprise customer service agents, which the company marketed as Automated Service Agents(tm). Microsoft acquired Colloquis in October 2006 and proceeded to de-commission SmarterChild and kill off the Automated Service Agent business as well.

In many ways, SmarterChild was a precursor to Apple&#x27;s Siri and Samsung&#x27;s S Voice. As Shawn Carolan of Menlo Ventures, a Siri investor, said, &quot;…When I first encountered Siri, SmarterChild already had ten million users and was getting a billion messages a day… The market was speaking.&quot;

Robert Hoffer, ActiveBuddy co-founder, licensed the technology from Microsoft after Microsoft abandoned the Colloquis technology.

<doc id="946227" wikidata="Q4022843" url="?curid=946227" title="Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)">
<text>[[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] (Yolanda Montez) is a fictional superheroine in DC Comics&#x27; shared universe, the DC universe. She first appeared in &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; #12 (March 1985), and was created by Roy Thomas, Dann Thomas, and Don Newton.

Yolanda Montez was the second Latina superhero, after Green Fury. The character appeared in the television series &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Yvette Monreal.

==Publication history==

Roy and Dann Thomas originally intended to create a Canadian superheroine named &quot;The Lynx&quot; for new 1980s-era descendants of the All-Star Squadron. An early incarnation of Wildcat named &quot;La Garro&quot; appears in promotional material for &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
Yolanda Montez is the daughter of Maria Montez and Juan Montez, and possesses cat-like abilities due to Maria being exposed to experimental drugs while pregnant. She later succeeds her godfather Ted Grant as Wildcat following his retirement. During this time, she joins Infinity, Inc. and has a flirtatious relationship with Nuklon.

Yolanda later retires after Infinity, Inc. disbands, but resurfaces to fight Eclipso, during which she is killed. Years later, Wildcat is resurrected in &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; and joins the Justice Society of America.

==Powers and abilities==
Wildcat is a metahuman who possesses cat-like agility and claws.

==Other versions==
An alternate universe variant of Yolanda Montez / Wildcat from Earth-2 appears in &quot;Earth 2: World&#x27;s End&quot; and &quot;Convergence&quot;. This version is the demonic avatar of the Red, a cosmic force connecting animal life.

==In other media==
Yolanda Montez appears in &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Yvette Monreal. This version is a high school student, a fan of Ted Grant, and the ex-girlfriend of Henry King Jr. Three months prior to the series, she became an outcast when her rival Cindy Burman leaked a risqué photo she had sent to Henry during a school presidential election to ruin her candidacy, which also soured her relationship with her Catholic parents and led to her pouring her frustrations into boxing. Montez later takes up Grant&#x27;s identity of Wildcat at Stargirl&#x27;s request to help rebuild the Justice Society of America (JSA). Montez would later go on to forgive Henry before he is killed by his father Brainwave and avenge him by killing the latter. In the second season, Montez becomes a part-time waitress, but suffers from PTSD as a result of her killing Brainwave. This eventually leads her to quit the JSA after suffering hallucinations of Henry and Brainwave, though she later agrees to return to help her friends defeat Eclipso. In the third season, Montez moves in with Stargirl&#x27;s family to protect her own.
* Ahead of the series&#x27; premiere, Montez and the JSA made a cameo appearance in the Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; via archive footage from the &quot;Stargirl&quot; episode &quot;The Justice Society&quot;.

<doc id="946248" wikidata="Q1993985" url="?curid=946248" title="Brüno Gehard">
<text>Brüno Gehard (; (“Gay-hard”) sometimes spelled &quot;Bruno&quot; or &quot;Brueno&quot;) is a satirical fictional character portrayed by English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. A flamboyantly gay fashion reporter from Austria, Brüno first appeared during short sketches on Paramount Comedy 1 in 1998, before reappearing on a 2003 episode of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; and &quot;Borat&quot;, Universal Studios gained the rights to produce and release a 2009 feature film about the character, also called &quot;Brüno&quot;. The character has since been retired.

==Eminem incident==
In May 2009, Brüno appeared at the MTV Movie Awards, dressed as an angel with wings strapped to his buttocks as he descended on wires from the ceiling. As part of a prank, after an alleged equipment malfunction, he was lowered onto rapper Eminem who was seated directly beneath him. Brüno landed in Eminem&#x27;s lap in a 69-esque position, with his exposed buttocks in Eminem&#x27;s face. Members of D12 helped to remove Brüno. Eminem and D12 then stormed out of the ceremony. Eminem appeared surprised and angry about the prank, but both he and Baron Cohen later claimed that the incident had been staged and rehearsed by the two. Eminem told reporters that he laughed uncontrollably for three hours in his hotel room afterward.

==Reaction==
The 2009 feature film Brüno was well received by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, who described him as &quot;howlingly funny, staggeringly rude, brutally incorrect and very often just brilliant&quot;.

=== LGBT response ===
Some LGBT groups have criticized the character as perpetuating LGBT stereotypes. &quot;Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s well-meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others,&quot; Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programmes for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) told &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

=== Ayman Abu Aita lawsuit ===
Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in July 2009, where he made reference to Ayman Abu Aita (whom Brüno interviewed in the film) as a terrorist. Abu Aita was identified in the film as a member of al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades, a Palestinian terrorist organization responsible for numerous suicide bombings. Abu Aita claimed that he was never a member of the group, though he had identified as such in a 2002 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article. He had also served two years in an Israeli prison for his role in the Second Intifada. Abu Aita made plans to sue, saying that he was misled and that he did not sign release forms for the footage of him that appeared in the film. Baron Cohen increased his security detail after &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; claimed to receive a statement from al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades threatening his life following the premiere of the film. In December 2009, Abu Aita sued Baron Cohen and Letterman at a federal court in Washington, D.C. In November 2010, the lawsuit was dismissed in D.C. so it could be refiled in the Supreme Court of New York, which also dismissed it in July 2012.

<doc id="946259" wikidata="Q650374" url="?curid=946259" title="Loverboy">
<text>Loverboy is a Canadian rock band formed in Calgary, Alberta in 1979. Loverboy&#x27;s hit singles, particularly &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; and &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot;, have become arena rock staples and are still heard on many classic rock and classic hits radio stations across Canada and the United States. 

After being rejected by many American record labels, Loverboy signed with Columbia/CBS Records Canada and began recording the debut album on March 20, 1980. Founding members were lead singer Mike Reno (previously with Moxy as Mike Rynoski), guitarist Paul Dean (previously with Scrubbaloe Caine and Streetheart), keyboardist Doug Johnson, bassist Jim Clench (replaced after one gig by Scott Smith) and drummer Matt Frenette.

Throughout the 1980s, Loverboy accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, earning four multi-platinum albums and selling millions of records. Except for a brief breakup from 1988 to 1991, the band has continued to perform live shows regularly. They are currently based in Vancouver.

==History==

===1979–1983===
According to Reno, their name was chosen due to a dream by Paul Dean. He had come up with the name after spending the previous night with some of the bandmates, including Reno and their girlfriends, before going to the movies. The girlfriends were browsing through fashion magazines, where the guys in the band saw a Cover Girl advertisement. Cover Girl became Cover Boy, and then became Loverboy in Dean&#x27;s dream later that night. After being told by Dean about the dream the next morning, Reno agreed to try it out and it stuck. 

Dean&#x27;s manager, Lou Blair, then brought in the biggest rock manager in Canada at that time, Bruce Allen, who took on the band and arranged for them to make their live debut opening for Kiss at Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, B.C., on November 19, 1979.

Originally rejected by all the major record labels in the United States, the band signed with Columbia Records of Canada, and on March 20, 1980, Loverboy went into the studio with producer Bruce Fairbairn and engineer Bob Rock to record what would be its self-titled debut album.

Over that summer, the record became a huge hit with eventually over one million records sold in Canada alone. The album made its American debut in November 1980, and went on to sell over two million copies in the US. The band went on a touring spree that year putting on over 200 shows with bands such as Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, Kansas and Def Leppard. Their debut single, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, went on to hit No. 7 on the Canadian charts and No. 35 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in early 1981. &quot;The Kid Is Hot Tonite&quot; was also a single.

The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Get Lucky&quot;, released in October 1981 when it was opening for Journey, included the hit tracks &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot;, &quot;When It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Lucky Ones&quot;. It became the group’s best selling album in the U.S., reaching No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts and selling over four million copies. In the same year Loverboy received six Juno Awards (Canada&#x27;s highest award for music) in one year, a record that still stands today.

Loverboy released its third album, &quot;Keep It Up&quot;, in June 1983. Its first single &quot;Hot Girls in Love&quot; became their most successful to that date, reaching No. 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The video for the song as well as for the follow-up single &quot;Queen of the Broken Hearts&quot; were hugely popular on MTV.

===1984–1989===
In 1984 Loverboy recorded the United States Team theme for the 1984 Summer Olympics, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop You Now&quot;. The song originally appeared on &quot;The Official Music of the 1984 Games&quot; but not on any of its albums or compilations to date. The band would often play it on tour mixing it in during the performance of &quot;Queen of the Broken Hearts&quot;.

Also in 1984, Loverboy recorded a song called &quot;Destruction&quot; which appeared on the 1984 soundtrack of a re-edited version of the film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927).

&quot;Lovin&#x27; Every Minute of It&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth album and first not produced by Fairbairn (it was produced by Tom Allom, best known for producing Judas Priest), was released in August 1985, with the title single written by Mutt Lange and &quot;This Could Be the Night&quot; co-written by Journey&#x27;s Jonathan Cain becoming their first and second U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10 hits respectively.

In 1986 the band recorded &quot;Heaven in Your Eyes&quot;, a song featured in the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts. Keyboardist Doug Johnson refused to appear in the video as he felt that the film glorified war, which he opposed.

The release of &quot;Wildside&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth album, followed in September 1987. While it scored a minor hit with &quot;Notorious&quot;, co-written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, the album sold relatively poorly and the band broke up in 1988 due to tensions between Dean and Reno.

Dean released a solo album, &quot;Hardcore&quot;, in May 1989 and a Loverboy greatest-hits album, &quot;Big Ones&quot;, was released later that same year, in October, to fulfill Loverboy&#x27;s obligation to Columbia Records. The group briefly reunited in late 1989 to tour (with Geraldo Valentino Dominelli on keyboards filling in for Johnson) to promote it, but broke up again at the tour&#x27;s conclusion.

===1991–1999===
On October 6, 1991, the band reunited again to join fellow rockers Bryan Adams, Colin James, Chrissy Steele and Bill Henderson of Chilliwack at a benefit show at Vancouver&#x27;s 86 Street Music Hall to raise over $50,000 for Henderson&#x27;s former bandmate, Brian MacLeod, who was fighting cancer and undergoing treatment at a Houston medical clinic. The band members reportedly recalled that the concert was the most fun that they had had in years and decided that they wanted to do it again. They went on another live touring spree in Canada the following year before launching a 64-concert tour in the United States in 1993.

The band&#x27;s record label released its second and third compilation albums, &quot;Loverboy Classics&quot; and &quot;Temperature&#x27;s Rising&quot;, in 1994. &quot;Loverboy Classics&quot; went Gold by 1998, coinciding with another American tour. This was followed by the releases of &quot;Six&quot; and &quot;Super Hits&quot; in 1997.

Keyboardist Richard Sera came on to fill in for Johnson in December 1996 through 1997.

===2000–2009: Death of Scott Smith===

The band continued touring until November 30, 2000, when bassist Scott Smith was presumed dead after being washed overboard by a large wave while sailing in San Francisco Bay. He was 45 years old.

The band went on to release a live album, &quot;Live, Loud and Loose&quot;, in 2001, which consisted of refurbished early live concert recordings from the band&#x27;s intense touring years from 1982 to 1986. The year 2001 also brought another round of touring, this time dedicated to Scott Smith. Ken &quot;Spider&quot; Sinnaeve, a former member of The Guess Who, Red Rider and Dean and Frenette&#x27;s pre-Loverboy band Streetheart, joined the band on bass prior to the tour.

Loverboy celebrated 25 years together in 2005 and began to perform in selected cities to commemorate this milestone. That tour continued with live concerts scheduled well into August 2006. Also in 2005, Loverboy was one of the featured bands on the American version of &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;. It performed &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Hero&quot; by Enrique Iglesias on the show.

In 2006, twenty-five years after its initial release, &quot;Get Lucky&quot; was remastered and re-released with several previously unreleased songs, including the original demo of &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot;.

In a video interview from March 2007, Mike Reno confirmed that the band finished recording a new studio album released in 2007. Titled &quot;Just Getting Started&quot;, it was released in October, with a clip of the first single &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; available on the band&#x27;s MySpace page. The band continues to tour throughout Canada and the United States.

The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame during the 2009 Juno Awards.

===2010–2019===
On February 21, 2010, the band performed at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics awards ceremony.

In June 2012 the band announced its album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Revival&quot; would be released by Frontiers Records. The band was on tour with Journey and Pat Benatar/Neil Giraldo from July 24 to November 16, 2012. It finished up 2012 on the same tour when Night Ranger took up the reins to replace Benatar.

In 2013 Loverboy toured on and off for at least a few dates during every month, except for the month of March.

While continuing to tour in 2014, it was announced on the official Loverboy home page on June 19, 2014, that the band&#x27;s newest album of all-original material, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, was expected to be released on July 15, 2014. The first single was already available for purchase on iTunes and the title of this song was &quot;Countin&#x27; the Nights&quot;. The band toured during that summer, including at least two free shows.

In 2016 the band released two new singles, &quot;Hurtin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, the latter is described by Paul Dean as &quot;the first and only shuffle Loverboy has ever done&quot;, comes from the same late &#x27;70s period as several of the songs found on their previous album, 2014&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. &quot;Giving it all away/Living for today,&quot; sings Mike Reno on the track – which originated as a demo, but was later rearranged and augmented by Dean, describing this latest as a &quot;gift&quot; from the band to its fans.

Dean went through more than 230 individual two-inch analog tapes he had transferred to digital, including this &quot;gem&quot; from the band&#x27;s storied history. It follows the release of &quot;Hurtin&#x27;&quot; earlier this year. &quot;The beauty of the Internet is the ability to make a song available right away, without waiting until you have the rest of the album done,&quot; says Dean. &quot;It&#x27;s a real boon to creativity. It&#x27;s total grass roots, DIY. Like the lyrics to &#x27;Some Like It Hot&#x27;, we&#x27;re not living for tomorrow or next year.&quot;

The single, artwork and accompanying music video – with a montage of a Loverboy program from the band&#x27;s 1983 Keep It Up tour – prominently features the late bassist Scott Smith. &quot;It was one of the first tunes we ever recorded,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#x27;s playing his ass off on it. I thought it was lost and gone forever. And, I think it would be a really good addition to our set list!&quot;

In 2016 a commercial and digital short for National Car Rental started airing that features the band and major fan Patrick Warburton, best known for his role as David Puddy in Seinfeld. After Warburton touts that four out of five National rentals result in a free upgrade, the group piles into the rental car with Warburton and drives home the commercial&#x27;s message with the title of one of their many hits, &quot;Lovin&#x27; Every Minute of It&quot;. There is also a digital short, specifically made available on National Car Rental&#x27;s YouTube channel, with Warburton having the group autograph their &quot;Get Lucky&quot; album, and pledging his devotion.

<doc id="946262" wikidata="Q453182" url="?curid=946262" title="Daniel Igali">
<text>Baraladei Daniel Igali (born February 3, 1974) is a Nigerian-Canadian wrestler. He won Canada&#x27;s first ever Olympic gold medal in wrestling at the 2000 Summer Olympics and remains Canada&#x27;s only male Olympic gold medalist in wrestling.

==Wrestling career==
As captain of the Nigerian wrestling team, Igali came to Canada to compete in the 1994 Commonwealth Games. He remained in the country while seeking refugee status due to political unrest in Nigeria. He acquired citizenship in 1998.

Igali enrolled at Douglas College before transferring to Simon Fraser University to study criminology. He represented SFU from 1997 to 1999, winning three straight NAIA Championships and finishing with a 116-0 record in collegiate wrestling. Additionally, Igali earned All-American honours three times and the two Gorriaran Awards (1997, 1999) for most pins in the least total time.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Igali won a gold medal for men&#x27;s 69 kg freestyle wrestling. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Igali won a gold medal in the Men&#x27;s 74 kg freestyle wrestling. In 2007, Igali was inducted into the Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. He was later inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 2012.

His wrestling career is highlighted in a television documentary directed by Joel Gordon called, &quot;Wrestling with Destiny: The Life and Times of Daniel Igali&quot;. The biographical documentary film was broadcast by CBC Television in 2004 as an episode of the &quot;Life and Times&quot; TV series.

Igali became the first elected president of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation in 2013, creating the highest morale athletes for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, and highest medal hopefuls for Nigeria at the Games. The Nigerian team has otherwise lacklustre morale outside of wrestling. In September 2022, Igali was elected as a board member of UWW (United World Wrestling) for a five year term.

==Politics==
On February 10, 2005, Igali announced that he would seek nomination as a candidate in Surrey-Newton for the British Columbia Liberal Party in the 2005 provincial election in British Columbia. He won the nomination, but was defeated by New Democrat opponent Harry Bains in the election.

==Personal==
He completed a Master of Arts degree in criminology at Simon Fraser University, having previously attended Douglas College. While working on his master&#x27;s degree, he trained at SFU and liked to help coach. Igali is currently the coach of the Nigerian National Wrestling Team.

In November 2006 Igali was injured during a violent robbery while in Nigeria. In 2020, he was the president of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation. He is a two-term member of the Bayelsa State assembly and also its sports commissioner.

In 2012, Igali was one of the recipients of the Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards presented by Canadian Immigrant Magazine.

<text>The Harry Ransom Center, known as the Humanities Research Center until 1983, is an archive, library, and museum at the University of Texas at Austin, specializing in the collection of literary and cultural artifacts from the Americas and Europe for the purpose of advancing the study of the arts and humanities. The Ransom Center houses 36 million literary manuscripts, one million rare books, five million photographs, and more than 100,000 works of art.

The center has a reading room for scholars and galleries which display rotating exhibitions of works and objects from the collections. In the 2015–16 academic year, the center hosted nearly 6,000 research visits, resulting in the publication of over 145 books.

==History==

Harry Ransom founded the Humanities Research Center in 1957 with the ambition of expanding the rare books and manuscript holdings of the University of Texas. He acquired the Edward Alexander Parsons Collection, the T. Edward Hanley Collection, and the Norman Bel Geddes Collection.

Ransom was only the official director of the center from 1958 to 1961, but he directed and presided over a period of great expansion in the collections until his resignation in 1971 as chancellor of the University of Texas System. The center moved into its current building in 1972.

F. Warren Roberts was the official director from 1961 to 1976. He acquired the Helmut Gernsheim collection of photographs and the archives of authors D. H. Lawrence, John Steinbeck, and Evelyn Waugh, and in 1968 the Carlton Lake Collection.

After Roberts&#x27;s tenure, John Payne and then Carlton Lake served as interim directors from 1976 to 1980. In 1978, the center acquired its complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible.

In 1980, the center hired Decherd Turner as director. Turner acquired the Giorgio Uzielli Collection of Aldine editions, the Anne Sexton archive, the Robert Lee Wolff Collection of 19th-century fiction, the Pforzheimer Collection, the David O. Selznick archive, the Gloria Swanson archive, and the Ernest Lehman Collection. Upon Decherd Turner&#x27;s retirement in 1988, Thomas F. Staley became director of the center.

Staley acquired the Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers, a copy of the Plantin Polyglot Bible, and more than 100 literary archives.

In September 2013, Stephen Enniss, former head librarian of the Folger Shakespeare Library, was appointed director of the Ransom Center. Under Enniss, the Ransom Center continued to collect archives, including those of Kazuo Ishiguro, Arthur Miller, and Ian McEwan.

In 1983, the institution&#x27;s name was changed from the Humanities Research Center to the Harry Ransom Center.

==Notable collections==

Two prominent items in the Ransom Center&#x27;s collections are a Gutenberg Bible, one of only 21 complete copies known to exist, and Nicéphore Niépce&#x27;s &quot;View from the Window at Le Gras&quot;, the first successful permanent photograph from nature. Both of these objects are on permanent display in the main lobby.

The center also houses many culturally important documents and artifacts. Particular strengths include modern literature, performing arts, and photography. Besides the Gutenberg Bible and the photograph, notable holdings include:

<text>North Korea competed as the &quot;Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot; at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s seventh appearance at the Olympics since its debut in 1972. North Korean athletes did not attend the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, when they joined the Soviet boycott, and subsequently, led a boycott at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, along with six other nations.

Olympic Committee of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea sent a total of 36 athletes, 13 men and 23 women, to compete only in 9 sports. For the second time in Olympic history, North Korea was represented by more female than male athletes due to its stark team size of women in diving and artistic gymnastics. Former basketball player and National Olympic Committee official Kim Song-Ho became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Both North Korea and South Korea marched together in the Parade of Nations at the Opening and Closing Ceremonies under the Korean Unification Flag, a white flag showing the united Korean peninsula in blue. They had two flagbearers carrying the flag together at each occasion, one representing the North and the other representing the South. The female athletes and staff wore red blazers, while their male counterparts wore blue. Although they marched together, the teams competed separately and had separate medal tallies.

North Korea left Athens with a total of five Olympic medals (four silver and one bronze), failing to claim a single gold for the second consecutive time since Sydney. All of these medals were awarded to the athletes in boxing, judo, shooting, table tennis, and weightlifting. Lightweight judoka Kye Sun-Hui managed to complete a full set of medals in her illustrious sporting career with a silver, in addition to her gold in Atlanta and bronze in Sydney.

<doc id="946289" wikidata="Q673649" url="?curid=946289" title="Beechcraft Bonanza">
<text>The Beechcraft Bonanza is an American general aviation aircraft introduced in 1947 by Beech Aircraft Corporation of Wichita, Kansas. The six-seater, single-engined aircraft is still produced by Beechcraft and has been in continuous production longer than any other aircraft in history. More than 17,000 Bonanzas of all variants have been built, produced in both distinctive V-tail and conventional tail configurations; early conventional-tail versions were marketed as the Debonair.

==Design and development==
At the end of World War II, two all-metal light aircraft emerged, the Model 35 Bonanza and the Cessna 195, that represented very different approaches to the premium end of the postwar civil-aviation market. With its high-wing, seven-cylinder radial engine, fixed tailwheel undercarriage, and roll-down side windows, the Cessna 195 was a continuation of prewar technology. The Bonanza, however, featured an easier-to-manage, horizontally opposed, six-cylinder engine, retractable tricycle undercarriage (although the nosewheel initially was not steerable, but castering) and low-wing configuration.

Designed by a team led by Ralph Harmon, the model 35 Bonanza was a relatively fast, low-wing, all-aluminum design, at a time when most light aircraft were still made of wood and fabric. The Model 35 featured retractable landing gear, and its signature V-tail (equipped with combination elevator-rudders called &quot;ruddervators&quot;). The prototype 35 Bonanza made its first flight on December 22, 1945, with the type receiving an airworthiness certificate on March 25, 1947. Production began that year. The first 30–40 Bonanzas produced had fabric-covered flaps and ailerons, after which those surfaces were covered with magnesium alloy sheet.

The Bonanza family eventually comprised three major variants:
* Model 35 Bonanza (1947–1982; V-tail)
* Model 33 Debonair or Bonanza (1960–1995; conventional tail)
* Model 36 Bonanza (1968–present; a stretched Model 33)

The Model 33 &quot;Debonair&quot; was introduced in 1960 as a lower-priced model with more austere standard instrumentation, exterior equipment, paint schemes, and interior fabrics and trim than the more prestigious V-tail Bonanza. However, most Bonanza features were available as factory options on the Debonair, and by the mid 1960s, most Debonair buyers were ordering most or all of these options. Realizing this, Beechcraft dropped the Debonair name and most of the basic and seldom-ordered standard features with the introduction of the E33 in 1968.

Despite its name, the Twin Bonanza is a substantially wider and heavier aircraft that is mostly dissimilar to the single-engined Bonanza; the only major shared parts are the front fuselage sides, windows, and main cabin door. However, the Twin Bonanza had trouble competing with the similarly capable but substantially lighter Cessna 310 and Piper PA-23, so Beechcraft used the basic Bonanza fuselage and many other Bonanza parts to create the twin-engined Travel Air, which was later developed into the Baron.

== Operational history ==

The V-tail design gained a reputation as the &quot;forked-tail doctor killer&quot;, due to crashes by overconfident wealthy amateur pilots, fatal accidents, and in-flight breakups. &quot;Doctor killer&quot; has sometimes been used to describe the conventional-tailed version, as well. However, a detailed analysis by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of accident records for common single-engine retractable-gear airplanes in the United States between 1982 and 1989 found that the Bonanza had a slightly lower accident rate than other types in the study. Pilot error was cited in 73% of V-tail crashes and 83% of conventional-tail crashes, with aircraft-related causes accounting for 15% and 11% of crashes respectively. However, the study noted that the aircraft had an unusually high incidence of gear-up landings and inadvertent landing gear retractions on the ground, which were attributed to a non-standard gear-retraction switch on early models that is easily confused with the switch that operates the flaps. Models starting in 1984 use a more distinctive relocated landing-gear switch, augmented by &quot;squat switches&quot; in the landing gear that prevent its operation while compressed by the aircraft&#x27;s weight, and a throttle position switch that prevents gear retraction at low engine power settings.

In 1982, the production of the V-tail Model 35 ended. In the late 1980s, repeated V-tail structural failures prompted the United States Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct extensive wind tunnel and flight tests, which proved that the V-tail did not meet type certification standards under certain conditions; the effort culminated with the issuance of an airworthiness directive to strengthen the tail, which significantly reduced the incidence of in-flight breakups. Despite this, Beech has long contended that most V-tail failures involve operations well beyond the aircraft&#x27;s intended flight envelope.
Subsequent analysis of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident records between 1962 and 2007 revealed an average of three V-tail structural failures per year, while the conventional-tailed Bonanza 33 and 36 suffered only eleven such failures in total during the same 45 years. Most V-tail failures involved flight under visual flight rules into instrument meteorological conditions, flight into thunderstorms, or airframe icing.

In addition to the structural issues, the Bonanza 35 has a relatively narrow center of gravity envelope, and the tail design is intolerant of imbalances caused by damage, improper maintenance, or repainting. Such imbalances may induce dangerous aeroelastic flutter. Due to the anodic properties of the magnesium used for the V-tail ruddervator skins, they tend to corrode, often resulting in permanent grounding of affected aircraft because the problem can only be fixed by complete replacement of the skins or the entire empennage, and the required parts are no longer available. The American Bonanza Society has issued a reward of $500,000 to encourage the development of aftermarket replacement skins under a supplemental type certificate. Despite these issues, many Bonanza 35 owners insist that the aircraft is reasonably safe, and its reputation has resulted in reduced purchase costs for budget-conscious buyers.

The conventional-tail Model 33 continued in production until 1995. Still built today is the Model 36 Bonanza, a longer-bodied, straight-tail variant of the original design, introduced in 1968. No Bonanzas were delivered in 2021, but on April 10, 2022, it was announced that production of the Bonanza G36 had restarted.

In January 2012, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued an airworthiness directive grounding all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas, and Debonairs equipped with a single pole-style yoke and that have forwarded elevator control cables that are more than 15 years old until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff, and resulting concerns about the age of the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding, some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced, and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin requesting that the elevator control cables be inspected during the annual inspection.

===QU-22 Pave Eagle===
The QU-22 was a Beech 36/A36 Bonanza modified during the Vietnam War to be an electronic monitoring signal relay aircraft, developed under the project name &quot;Pave Eagle&quot; for the United States Air Force. An AiResearch turbocharged, reduction-geared Continental GTSIO-520-G engine was used to reduce its noise signature, much like the later Army-Lockheed YO-3A. These aircraft were intended to be used as unmanned drones to monitor seismic and acoustic sensors dropped along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos and report troop and supply movements. When the project was put into operation in 1968, however, the aircraft were all flown by pilots of the 554th Reconnaissance Squadron Detachment 1, call sign &quot;Vampire&quot;. A separate operation &quot;Compass Flag&quot; monitored the General Directorate of Rear Services along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, linking to the 6908th security squadron.

Six YQU-22A prototypes (Model 1074, modifications of the Beech 33 Debonair) were combat-tested in 1968, and two were lost during operations, with a civilian test pilot killed. Twenty-seven QU-22Bs (Model 1079) were modified, 13 in 1969 and 14 in 1970, with six lost in combat. Two Air Force pilots were killed in action. All the losses were due to engine failures or effects of turbulence. A large cowl bump above the spinner was faired-in for an AC current generator, and a higher weight set of Baron wings and spars were used to handle the fuel load.

;QU-22B (Model 1079)
:Production drone model for the USAF operation Pave Eagle, 27 built, modified with turbocharging, three-bladed propeller, and tip-tanks

===Model 40===
;Model 40
:The Beechcraft Model 40 was an experimental twin-engined aircraft based on the Bonanza. Only one prototype was built in 1948. It featured a unique over/under arrangement of two 180-hp Franklin engines mounted with one on top of the other and driving a single propeller. The plane had a different engine cowl from a standard Bonanza, and the nose gear could not fully retract, but otherwise it greatly resembled the production Bonanzas of the time. Certification rules demanded a firewall be fitted between the two engines, however, thus stopping development. The FAA registration of the Model 40 was canceled on January 26, 1951.

==Notable flights==
* In January 1949, the fourth Bonanza to come off the production line was piloted by Captain William Odom from Honolulu, Hawaii, to the continental United States (2,900 statute miles), the first light airplane to do so. The airplane was called &quot;Waikiki Beech&quot;, and its 40-gallon (150 L) fuel capacity was increased (using fuselage and wing tanks) to 268 gallons (1010 L), which gave a still-air range of nearly 5,000 statute miles.
* In March 1949, Captain Odom piloted &quot;Waikiki Beech&quot; a distance of from Honolulu to Teterboro, New Jersey, setting a nonstop record. The flight time was 36:01 hours, at an average speed of , consuming of fuel. After that flight, the airplane was donated to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air Museum, as the National Air and Space Museum was then called.
* On October 7, 1951, an American congressman from Illinois, Peter F. Mack, Jr., began an around-the-world trip in &quot;Waikiki Beech&quot;, on loan from the museum and reconditioned at the Beech factory, and renamed &quot;Friendship Flame&quot;. He spent 15 weeks traveling through 30 countries (223 hours flight time). The plane was again refurbished in 1975 and returned to the National Air and Space Museum. It is still on display there, with both names painted on its sides.
* On May 31, 2014, 19-year-old MIT student Matt Guthmiller from Aberdeen, South Dakota, departed Gillespie Field in El Cajon, California, in a 1981 A36 Bonanza on a 44-day-12-hour solo circumnavigation, making him the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; holder as the youngest person to fly solo around the world when he landed back in El Cajon on July 14, 2014, at 19 years, 7 months, and 15 days of age. During 170 hours of flight time, he made 23 stops in 15 countries on five continents, and covered about , while raising awareness for computer science education and supporting Code.org.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On October 28, 1947, Oregon Governor Earl Snell, Oregon Secretary of State Robert S. Farrell Jr., and State Senate President Marshall E. Cornett were killed along with pilot Cliff Hogue when their Bonanza 35 crashed in stormy weather southwest of Dog Lake in Lake County, Oregon.
* On January 26, 1952, Zubeida Begum and Hanwant Singh, Maharaja of Jodhpur, died when their Beechcraft Bonanza crashed in Godwar (Rajasthan), India. Hanwant Singh was overworked while campaigning for elections and is reported to have been sleeping only four hours a night. The wreckage from this crash was discovered in storage in the cellar of the Central Jail in Jodhpur in 2011.
* On July 31, 1955, the rising Hollywood star Robert Francis died with two others when the Bonanza he was piloting crashed immediately after take-off from Burbank Airport.
* On February 3, 1959, rock and roll stars Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper, as well as pilot Roger Peterson, died when their Beechcraft Bonanza 35, registration N3794N, crashed shortly after takeoff at night in poor weather. The accident in northern Iowa later became known as &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;, after Don McLean referred to it by that name in his song &quot;American Pie&quot;.
* On July 31, 1964, country music star Jim Reeves and his pianist Dean Manuel died when the Beechcraft Debonair N8972M Reeves was piloting crashed in the Brentwood area of Nashville during a violent thunderstorm.
* On February 14, 1975, Congressman Jerry Pettis was killed when the Beechcraft Model V35B Bonanza he was piloting crashed near Cherry Valley, California, after he encountered adverse weather conditions. The Jerry Pettis Memorial Veterans Administration Hospital in Loma Linda, California, is named in his honor.
* On February 7, 1981, Apple Computer cofounder Steve Wozniak crashed his Beechcraft Bonanza while taking off from Santa Cruz Sky Park. The NTSB investigation revealed Wozniak did not have a &quot;high performance&quot; endorsement (meaning he was not legally qualified to operate the airplane) and had a &quot;lack of familiarity with the aircraft.&quot; The cause of the crash was determined to be a premature liftoff, followed by a stall and &quot;mush&quot; into a 12-foot embankment. Wozniak later made a full recovery, albeit with a case of temporary anterograde amnesia.
* On March 19, 1982, Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s guitarist Randy Rhoads was killed when the wing of the Bonanza F35 in which he was riding hit the band&#x27;s tour bus then crashed into a tree and a nearby residence. Both of the other people on the aircraft, pilot Andrew Aycock and Osbourne&#x27;s makeup artist Rachel Youngblood, also died in the crash. The NTSB cited the causes of the crash as poor judgement, buzzing, and misjudged clearance, as well as indicating that the use of the aircraft was not authorized by the aircraft&#x27;s owner.
* On January 14, 1996, Armenian-Turkish musician Onno Tunç died when a private Bonanza crashed in bad weather on a mountain at Tazdağ near Selimiye village of Armutlu, Yalova on his journey from Bursa to Istanbul.
* On March 13, 2006, game show host Peter Tomarken crashed his Bonanza A36 into Santa Monica Bay while climbing from Santa Monica Airport in California. He was &quot;en route&quot; to San Diego to pick up a cancer patient who needed transportation to UCLA Medical Center for treatment. Tomarken and his wife were killed in the crash.
* On July 23, 2014, Haris Suleman, a Pakistani-American pilot attempting to fly around the world in 30 days to promote education, crashed his Beechcraft Bonanza in the Pacific Ocean, killing him and leaving his father Babar Suleman, also on board, missing.

<text>Intergraph Standard File Formats (ISFF) are the file formats common to MicroStation and Intergraph&#x27;s Interactive Graphics Design System (IGDS). ISFF is made available to the public, so that third-party developers could create applications for MicroStation that read and write ISFF format without a license from Intergraph.

*Design files, or DGN files (*.dgn) are binary files with variable-length records for graphic elements, and non-graphic data. 
*Cell library files (*.cel) are binary files that store cell definitions for placement in design files.

MicroStation versions 8 and newer support the V8 DGN file format, but which has a different internal data structure than the ISFF-based DGN. In cases where there is potential for confusion, ISFF-based DGN may be called Intergraph DGN, or V7 DGN.

Autodesk has chosen not to support DGN in AutoCAD 2006, although it does support the format in its Map3D, Land Desktop, and Civil3D products.

<text>OpenAccess is a proprietary API controlled by the OpenAccess Coalition that aims to facilitate Interoperability of electronic design automation software among the members of that coalition.

==OpenAccess Coalition==
OpenAccess Coalition is a coalition amongst integrated circuit manufacturers to provide a standard for designing integrated circuit chips. The OpenAccess Coalition is an organization of semiconductor industry companies claiming to be competition-neutral that are leading this effort operating under Silicon Integration Initiative bylaws.

The OpenAccess Coalition consists both of EDA user companies (IC designers and manufacturers) and EDA provider companies, including Advanced Micro Devices, Agile Analog, AnaGlobe Technology, Analog Rails, ANSYS, AWR/National Instruments Corporation, Blue Cheetah Analog Design, Cadence Design Systems, Chengdu Higon IC Design, CST - Computer Simulation Technology, DXCorr Design, Empyrean Software, Entasys Design, Fractal Technologies, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, INTENTO DESIGN, Invecas, Jedat, Keysight Technologies, Lattice Semiconductor, Life Technologies, Luceda, MediaTek, Mentor Graphics, Mythic, NVMEngines, PDF Solutions, Pulsic, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, Savarti, Silvaco, Synopsys, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Zuken.

==OpenAccess software==
OpenAccess consists of a data API of which the source code is available only to coalition members.

The OpenAccess API is a C++ program interface to IC design data stored in an electronic design database, with an architecture designed to ensure easy integration of contributions from various companies which may implement database enhancements or add proprietary extensions. It also includes the reference database supporting that API for IC design in multiple programming languages: C++, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby and Tcl.

In the past, electronic design flows were a combinations of proprietary applications and copyrighted EDA databases, with many different file formats and syntaxes. As a result, significant efforts were required from IC CAD engineers to integrate them for particular projects. The resulting flows were often fragile, inefficient and therefore result in longer design cycles. OpenAccess effort is therefore attempting to create a standardized design flow among its participants.

===Development history===
The OpenAccess coalition was formed in Q4 1999. The members issued a request-for-technology for existing technology, looking for a solution that was proven and would be commercially adopted, and that supported a broad set of EDA tools. As a result, the Cadence Genesis database and API was selected and now forms the technology base for OpenAccess.

In 2005 the Cadence Berkeley Labs and the Silicon Integration Initiative launched the OpenAccesGear, a project to develop open source utilities on top of the OpenAccess database. Participants included University of California at Berkeley, UCLA and UCSC. The OAGear project was subsequently suspended. Si2 has offered OAGear as an unsupported project.

<doc id="946305" wikidata="Q998377" url="?curid=946305" title="What About Bob?">
<text>What About Bob? is a 1991 American comedy film directed by Frank Oz and starring Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. Murray plays Bob Wiley, a mentally unstable patient who follows his egotistical psychotherapist, Dr. Leo Marvin (Dreyfuss), on vacation. When Bob befriends the members of Leo&#x27;s family, the patient&#x27;s problems push the doctor over the edge. The film received positive reviews and grossed $63.7 million in the US.

==Plot==
In New York City, neurotic and multiphobic Bob Wiley spends his life in an near-constant state of distress. Exasperated by Bob&#x27;s high-maintenance needs, his therapist closes his practice and refers Bob to the egotistical and controlling Dr. Leo Marvin, who believes his new therapy book, &quot;Baby Steps&quot; will make him famous. Leo gifts Bob a copy of &quot;Baby Steps&quot; and makes an appointment to see him in a month following the Marvin family&#x27;s vacation. Unable to cope without regular reassurance, Bob repeatedly calls Leo&#x27;s telephone exchange in failed attempts to deduce where he is staying. Bob then visits the exchange while posing as a detective investigating Bob&#x27;s suicide and learns that the Marvins are at Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire.

Bob travels to Lake Winnipesaukee by bus, irritating the other passengers with his habits. He encounters Leo, who agrees to call Bob at a local coffee shop if he then returns home. Out of spite, the shop owners, the Guttmans—whom Leo outbid for their dream lake house—take Bob directly to Leo. Bob is introduced to Leo&#x27;s wife Fay, their teenage daughter Anna, and young son Siggy, who are charmed by his eccentric personality, much to the uptight Leo&#x27;s chagrin. Eager to get rid of Bob, Leo tells him to return to the city and take a vacation from his problems. Having never been on vacation, Bob takes the advice literally, remaining in Lake Winnipesaukee.

Bob unintentionally bonds with Leo&#x27;s family, going sailing with Anna (after being tied to the mast to overcome his fears), inadvertently giving Siggy the confidence to dive into the lake—which Leo had failed to instill for years—and overcomes his germophobia. After Leo pushes Bob into the lake, Fay forces him to apologize and invites Bob to dinner. Oblivious to Leo&#x27;s hostility, Bob accepts as he believes the events are part of Leo&#x27;s radical therapy techniques. A thunderstorm forces Bob to spend the night, but Leo demands that he leave the following morning before &quot;Good Morning America&quot; arrives to interview him about &quot;Baby Steps&quot;. The TV crew arrive early and, despite Leo&#x27;s reluctance, feature Bob in the interview as an example of his book&#x27;s success. Leo humilitates himself during the interview by giving stilted and nervous responses while Bob speaks highly of the Marvins and the book, unwittingly stealing the spotlight.

Infuriated, Leo attempts to have Bob institutionalized, but he quickly befriends the hospital staff who are convinced he is perfectly sane. Leo then abandons Bob in a remote location, but Bob hitches a ride back to the lake house while various mishaps delay Leo. A dishevelled Leo returns after nightfall, but is happily surprised by the crowd awaiting him for his birthday, including his sister Lily. When Bob appears and puts his arm around Lily, Leo snaps and attacks him. Leo is sedated and his family reluctantly ask Bob to leave due to Leo&#x27;s seemingly irrational anger towards him.

A manic Leo sneaks out and steals a large amount of explosives from the general store. He abducts Bob, straps him to the explosives, and abandons him in the woods, dubbing the experience &quot;death therapy&quot;. Believing the explosives are a metaphor for his problems, Bob frees himself of his restraints and remaining fears. He reunites with the Marvins and praises Leo for curing him. Leo worriedly enquires about the whereabouts of the explosives, which Bob reveals are in the lake house. The house explodes, to the observing Guttman&#x27;s delight, and Leo is rendered catatonic and eventually institutionalized.

Some time later, Bob marries Lily and, upon their pronouncement as husband and wife, Leo snaps out of his catatonic state and screams, &quot;No!&quot;, but the sentiment is lost in the family&#x27;s excitement at his recovery. A closing text reveals that Bob went back to school and became a psychologist, then wrote a best-selling book titled &quot;Death Therapy&quot;, for which Leo is suing him for the rights.

==Cast==
==Production==
Before Frank Oz was hired to direct, Garry Marshall was considered, and Woody Allen was approached to play Dr. Marvin. Allen was also considered to direct and possibly co-write the script with Tom Schulman. However, because Allen had always generated his own projects rather than getting handed an existing property to make his own, Oz was hired to direct. Allen also declined the role of Dr. Marvin, thus Richard Dreyfuss was ultimately cast. Patrick Stewart was also considered for the role. Early in development, Robin Williams was attached to the project.

===Filming===
&quot;What About Bob?&quot; was filmed in and around the town of Moneta, Virginia, located on Smith Mountain Lake. For the scene in which Bob accidentally blows the house up, producers used a -sized model replica of the actual house that they detonated on a nearby lot. The scenes of Bob arriving in town on the bus with his goldfish were filmed in downtown Moneta, which was repainted for the movie. The local institute where Leo tries to commit Bob is actually the local Elks National Home for retirees in the nearby town of Bedford, Virginia. Scenes were also shot in New York City. According to Oz, Murray was &quot;really frightened&quot; about filming in the city. Murray said that he improvised a lot in the film.

===Production difficulties===
Oz has confirmed in interviews that there was conflict on the set during the making of the film. In addition, both Murray and Dreyfuss have stated in separate interviews that they did not get along with each other during filming:

Oz himself also verified that there was a feud between Murray and Dreyfuss:

In subsequent interviews, Dreyfuss reiterated what he said of his experience working with Murray, notably when he appeared at Fan Expo Canada in 2017. Dreyfuss further alleged in 2019 that at one point during the production, Murray screamed at him while intoxicated, telling him &quot;Everyone hates you! You are tolerated!&quot; and then threw an ashtray at him. When Murray appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in 2014, Howard Stern asked him if he intended to irritate Dreyfuss. Murray responded: &quot;I really try to make the other actor look good whenever I can (...) In this particular film, annoying Dreyfuss, which I kind of got to enjoy I gotta confess—but I didn&#x27;t try to annoy him off the screen.&quot; Although neither of them have crossed paths since the release of the film, Dreyfuss confirmed in a 2020 interview that he has forgiven Murray.

Producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray that resulted in his tossing her into a lake. Ziskin confirmed in 2003: &quot;Bill also threatened to throw me across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot. I was furious and outraged at the time, but having produced a dozen movies, I can safely say it is not common behavior&quot;.

In April 2022, following the suspension of the &quot;Being Mortal&quot; production, Dreyfuss&#x27;s son Ben tweeted a recollection about Murray&#x27;s on-set behavior towards his father and Ziskin: &quot;Bill Murray had a meltdown during [&quot;What About Bob?&quot;] because he wanted an extra day off and Laura said no and he ripped her glasses off her face and my dad complained about his behavior and Bill Murray threw an ashtray at him.&quot; Ben also added, &quot;Everyone walked off the production and flew back to L.A. and it only resumed after Disney hired some bodyguards to physically separate my dad and Bill Murray in between takes.&quot;

===Profits lawsuit===
In April 2015, Richard Dreyfuss sued The Walt Disney Company over the film&#x27;s profits. Dreyfuss has claimed that Disney refused to hire his chosen auditor, Robinson and Co. Christine Turner Wagner, widow of &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot; (1989) producer Raymond Wagner, was also involved with the lawsuit.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;What About Bob?&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on May 17, 1991. During its opening weekend it grossed a total of $9.2million from 1,463 theaters—an average of $6,299 per theater—making it the highest grossing film of the weekend, ahead of &quot;F/X2&quot; ($3.9million) and &quot;&quot; ($3.4million), both in their second weekend. In its second weekend—taking place over the extended 4-day Memorial Day holiday—&quot;What About Bob?&quot; fell to the number2 position with an $11.2million gross, placing it behind &quot;Backdraft&quot; ($15.7million) and ahead of &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; ($7.1million), both films making their debut. &quot;What About Bob?&quot; fell to the number3 position in its third weekend with a $6.4million gross, behind the debut of &quot;Soapdish&quot; ($6.7million) and ahead of &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; ($4.2million), in its second weekend.

&quot;What About Bob?&quot; remained in the top-ten highest-grossing films for seven weeks. In total, &quot;What About Bob?&quot; grossed $63.7million compared to its $39million budget, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of 1991. This also made it Buena Vista&#x27;s second highest-grossing live action film of the year behind &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;.

===Critical response===

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;What About Bob?&quot; an 82% approval rating based on reviews from 44 critics and an average rating of 6.50/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss&#x27; chemistry helps make the most of a familiar yet durable premise, elevating &quot;What About Bob?&quot; into the upper ranks of &#x27;90s comedies&quot;.

When the television program &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot; reviewed the film, Roger Ebert gave the film a &quot;thumbs up&quot; rating praising the different performances of Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss onscreen together as well as most of the film&#x27;s humor. He said it was Bill Murray&#x27;s best film since &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; in 1984. Gene Siskel gave it a &quot;thumbs down&quot; rating and felt Murray gave a very funny and enjoyable performance in the film, but was rather upset by the Dreyfuss character and his angry and arrogant behaviors. He felt it would have been funnier if Dreyfuss had not given such an angry performance in the film and said that Dreyfuss ultimately ruined the film for him. Leonard Maltin said it is &quot;a very funny outing with Murray and Dreyfuss approaching the relationship of the road runner and the coyote&quot;. Maltin faulted the film only for its ending, which he found very abrupt and silly. Lou Cedrone from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; criticized the film: &quot;It is too predictable and deals with a situation that is more irritating than amusing&quot;.

Bravo ranked it number 44 on their 2013 list of the &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;, behind &quot;Shampoo&quot; and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;.

<text>Nageia is a genus of conifers belonging to the podocarp family Podocarpaceae. &quot;Nageia&quot; includes evergreen shrubs and trees, from one to 54 meters in height. A 2009 treatment of the genus recognized five species. Some authors consider &quot;Nageia formosensis&quot; to be a separate species from &quot;Nageia nagi&quot;, thus recognizing six species. The podocarp genera have been reshuffled by various botanists. Most recently, several species formerly classed as &quot;Nageia&quot; were moved to the new genus &quot;Retrophyllum&quot;, while &quot;Nageia falcata&quot; and &quot;Nageia mannii&quot; were moved to the new genus &quot;Afrocarpus&quot;.

== Description ==
&quot;Nageia&quot; are evergreen woody plants that usually grow as trees but may also rarely be shrubs, varying in height from one to 54 meters. The branching is irregular. The thin and hard bark often peels with scale-like plates.

The leaves are simple and flat. The phyllotaxis or leaf arrangement can be spiral or subopposite and nearly decussate. The leaf petioles are frequently twisted so the leaves form a flat plane around the shoot. The leaf blade is elliptic, ovate-elliptic or lanceolate in shape. Juvenile leaves are similar in shape to the adult leaves but may be larger or smaller depending on the species. The leaves have multiple parallel longitudinal veins converging toward the ends. Stomata may be found on either both surfaces of the leaf or only the abaxial or underside. The leaf surface is coriaceous.

&quot;Nageia&quot; are generally dioecious, with male pollen cones and female seed cones borne on separate individual plants but may sometimes be monoecious. The cones are pedunculate and develop from axillary buds.

The pollen cones are long and ovoid-cylindric in shape. They may be solitary or grow in small spicate groups of two to six cones. Each pollen cone has numerous spirally inserted microsporophylls. The microsprophylls may be triangular or apiculate in shape. Each of them has two basal pollen sacs with bisaccate pollen.

The seed cones are solitary and have long peduncles. They have several sterile and one or rarely two fertile scales, each fertile scale with one seed producing ovule. Depending on the species, as the cone matures, the sterile scales may fuse and become fleshy as in the closely related &quot;Podocarpus&quot; or they may wither. A part of the cone scale supporting the ovule develops into a drupe-like fleshy covering known as the epimatium. The fleshy parts of the cones attract birds, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings.

The species of &quot;Nageia&quot; are distinguished from similar &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and the other genera in the Podocarpaceae by their broad, flat subopposite leaves with no midrib, superficially similar to those of the unrelated &quot;Agathis&quot; (Araucariaceae). &quot;Nageia&quot; is the only genus in Podocarpaceae with multi-veined leaves.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Nageia&quot; can be found in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests of Asia and Australasia, from Assam in eastern India across Southeast Asia to southern China and southern Japan, and across Malesia, from the Malay Peninsula across Indonesia to New Guinea and New Britain. An outpost of &quot;N. wallichiana&quot; is found in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests of southern India, where it is thought to be a relatively recent colonist in biogeographical terms.

&quot;Nageia&quot;, like many podocarps, can usually be found scattered throughout the forest mixed with other trees, and is rarely if ever found growing in pure stands. The wood is yellowish, typical of podocarps, and a few species are locally important for lumber.

The oldest fossils assigned to the genus are known from the Early Cretaceous of Japan, China and Russia. Other fossils are known from the Eocene of China.

== Classification ==
The genus contains six species:
;formerly included
moved to other genera: &quot;Acmopyle Afrocarpus Amentotaxus Cephalotaxus Dacrycarpus Dacrydium Falcatifolium Madhuca Parasitaxus Podocarpus Prumnopitys Putranjiva&quot; (Putranjivaceae) &quot;Retrophyllum Sundacarpus&quot;

<doc id="946319" wikidata="Q419183" url="?curid=946319" title="Orpiment">
<text>Orpiment, also known as ″yellow [[arsenic blende]]″ is a deep-colored, orange-yellow arsenic sulfide mineral with formula . It is found in volcanic fumaroles, low-temperature hydrothermal veins, and hot springs and may be formed through sublimation.

Orpiment takes its name from the Latin &quot;auripigmentum&quot; (&quot;aurum&quot;, &quot;gold&quot; + &quot;pigmentum&quot;, &quot;pigment&quot;), due to its deep-yellow color. Orpiment once was widely used in artworks, medicine, and other applications. Because of its toxicity and instability, its usage has declined.

== Etymology ==
The Latin &quot;auripigmentum&quot; (&quot;aurum&quot;, &quot;gold&quot; + &quot;pigmentum&quot;, &quot;pigment&quot;) referred both to its deep-yellow color and to the historical belief that it was thought to contain gold. The Latin term was used by Pliny in the first century after Christ.

The Greek for orpiment was &quot;arsenikon&quot;, deriving from the Greek word &quot;arsenikos&quot;, meaning &quot;male&quot;, from the belief that metals were of different sexes. This Greek term was used by Theophrastus in the fourth century BC.

The Chinese term for orpiment is &quot;Ci-Huang&quot; (in Pinyin), meaning &quot;female yellow&quot;.

The Persian for orpiment is &quot;zarnikh&quot;, deriving from the word &quot;zar&quot;, the Persian for gold.

== Physical and optical properties ==
Orpiment is a common monoclinic arsenic sulfide mineral. It has a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and a specific gravity of 3.49. It melts at to . Optically, it is biaxial (−) with refractive indices of &quot;a&quot; = 2.4, &quot;b&quot; = 2.81, &quot;g&quot; = 3.02.

== Visual characteristics ==
Orpiment is a type of lemon-yellow to golden- or brownish-yellow crystal commonly found in foliated columnar or fibrous aggregates, may alternatively be botryoidal or reniform, granular or powdery, and, rarely, as prismatic crystals. Used as a pigment, orpiment&#x27;s color is often described as a lemon- or canary-yellow, and occasionally as a golden- or brownish-yellow.

In the Munsell color system, &quot;orpiment&quot; is designated &quot;brilliant yellow&quot;, Munsell notation 4.4Y 8.7 /8.9.

=== Orpiment and realgar ===
Orpiment and realgar are closely related minerals and are often categorized in the same group. They are both arsenic sulfides and belong to the monoclinic crystal system. They are found in the same deposits and can form in the same geologic environments. As a result, Orpiment and realgar share similar physical properties and histories of use by humans.

In Chinese, the names for orpiment and realgar are &quot;Ci-Huang&quot; and &quot;Xiong-Huang&quot;, respectively meaning &quot;female yellow&quot; and &quot;male yellow&quot;. Their names symbolize their close natural conjunction, both physically in terms of their occurrence and properties and culturally in Chinese traditions.

Orpiment and realgar can be distinguished by their different visual characteristics. While orpiment typically has a vibrant golden-yellow color, realgar, in contrast, normally has an orange or reddish hue.

== Permanence and conservation ==
Yellow orpiment (As2S3) degrades into arsenic oxides. Because of their solubility in water, arsenic oxides readily migrate to the surrounding environment. In painted works using orpiment, migrating, degraded arsenic oxides are often detectable throughout the multi-layered paint system. This widespread arsenic migration has consequences for the conservation of orpiment as a pigment in works of art. 

Orpiment is also sensitive to light exposure, decaying into a friable white arsenic trioxide over time. Similarly, on ancient, orpiment-coated manuscript paper in Nepal, orpiment used to deter insects has often turned white over time.

Because of orpiment&#x27;s solubility and instability as a pigment, preventing the degradation of orpiment may need to be prioritized in art conservation. Proper conservation methods should minimize exposure to strong light. Such methods should emphasize humidity control and avoid the use of water-based cleaning agents.

== Use by artists ==
Orpiment has historically been used in artworks in many locales in the Eastern Hemisphere. It was one of the few clear, bright-yellow pigments available to artists until the 19th century.

=== Historical and regional use of orpiment ===
In Egypt, lumps of orpiment pigment have been found in a fourteenth-century BC tomb. In China, orpiment is known to have been used to color Chinese lacquer, despite no written sources mentioning this. Orpiment has also been identified on Central Asian wall paintings from the sixth to the thirteenth centuries. In a traditional Thai painting technique, still in use today, yellow ink for writing and drawing on black paper manuscripts is made using orpiment.

Medieval European artists imported orpiment from Asia Minor. Orpiment has been identified on Norwegian wooden altar frontals, polychrome sculptures, and folk art objects, including a crucifix. It was also used in twelfth- to sixteenth-century Eastern Orthodox icons from Bulgaria, Russia, and the former Yugoslavia. In Venice, records show that orpiment was purchased for a Romanian prince in 1600. European use of orpiment was uncommon until the nineteenth century, during which it saw use as a pigment in Impressionist paintings.

=== Orpiment as a pigment ===
In the Medieval Norwegian church of Tingelstad, orpiment was used in painting the altar frontal.

Orpiment was commonly combined with indigo dye to make a dark, rich green. In the &quot;Wilton Diptych&quot; (c 1395-9), this green pigment was used in egg tempera on the left panel for the green cloak of Edmund the Martyr.

Renaissance artists such as Raphael also used orpiment as a yellow pigment. In Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Sistine Madonna&quot; from 1513–14, orpiment is used to achieve yellow on the clothing of the figures and in the background.

Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Vincenzo Morosini&quot; from about 1575–80 uses the pigment in its details. Orpiment is used to replicate the gold embroidery on Morosini&#x27;s embroidered stole and to highlight the fur of the spotted ferret on his chest.

=== Limitations ===
Orpiment was one of the few clear, bright-yellow pigments available to artists until the 19th century. Its extreme toxicity and incompatibility with other, common, pigments, including lead and copper-based substances such as verdigris and azurite, meant that its use as a pigment ended when cadmium yellows, chromium yellows and organic aniline dye-based colors were introduced during the 19th century.

== Other historical uses ==
Orpiment was traded in the Roman Empire and was used as a medicine in China, even though it is very toxic. It has been used as fly poison and to tip arrows with poison. Because of its striking color, it was of interest to alchemists, both in China and Europe, searching for a way to make gold. It also has been found in the wall decorations of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb and ancient Egyptian scrolls, and on the walls of the Taj Mahal. For centuries, orpiment was ground down and used as a pigment in painting and for sealing wax, and was even used in ancient China as a correction fluid. Orpiment is mentioned in the 17th century by Robert Hooke in &quot;Micrographia&quot; for the manufacture of small shot. Scientists like Richard Adolf Zsigmondy and Hermann Ambronn puzzled jointly over the amorphous form of , &quot;orpiment glass&quot;, as early as 1904.

== Industry uses ==
Orpiment is used in the production of infrared-transmitting glass, oil cloth, linoleum, semiconductors, photoconductors, pigments, and fireworks. Mixed with two parts of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), orpiment is still commonly used in rural India as a depilatory. It is used in the tanning industry to remove hair from hides.

Orpiment has been used as bookends. In 2023, the UK Office for Product Safety and Standards recalled 40 pieces sold by TK Maxx between June and October 2022, due to the mineral&#x27;s toxicity.

<doc id="946320" wikidata="Q6376665" url="?curid=946320" title="Kathleen Brown">
<text>Kathleen Lynn Brown (born September 25, 1945) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 29th treasurer of California from 1991 to 1995. Brown unsuccessfully ran for governor of California in the 1994 election.

==Early life and education==
Brown was born in San Francisco, the youngest of four children of former California Governor Pat Brown (1959–1967). She is the youngest sister of twice-California Governor Jerry Brown (1975–1983, 2011–2019). Brown is a graduate of Stanford University and Fordham University School of Law.

== Political career ==
Brown was elected to the Los Angeles City Board of Education in 1975, then re-elected in 1979. She was a member of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works from 1987 to 1989. 

=== California State Treasurer ===
Brown successfully ran for treasurer of California in 1990. After defeating Compton city treasurer Wesley Sanders in the Democratic primary, Brown faced Republican incumbent Thomas W. Hayes in the general election. Hayes, who had been appointed to the office a year prior, ran an advertisement asking voters if they “Remember Jerry Brown?” to tie her to her brother&#x27;s unpopularity. 

During the campaign, Brown described herself as the &quot;financial Brown&quot;, and held a large financial advantage versus Hayes. Brown&#x27;s strength among female voters and the electorate in Northern California ultimately powered her victory.

=== 1994 gubernatorial election ===

In 1994, Brown ran for governor of California against Republican incumbent Pete Wilson. Her candidacy made her the third member of her family, after her father and brother, to run for the office. Running on the slogan &quot;America&#x27;s Best Treasurer to Revive America&#x27;s Worst Economy&quot;, Brown&#x27;s campaign focused on economic issues facing the state. Her campaign&#x27;s senior advisor was Steve Glazer, who was later elected to the California State Senate.

In the spring of 1994, Brown appeared favored in the contest, with a Field Poll taken in April 1994 showing her with a 51 to 39 percent lead over the incumbent. By fall, however, polls had tightened considerably, which was partially credited to California&#x27;s economic condition improving by election day. 

Brown ultimately lost to Wilson, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; concluding that she &quot;changed issues too often and ran out of money&quot;. Despite speculation that she would run for Governor again in 1998, she did not enter the race.

== Post-political career ==
Brown is a partner in law firm Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips. Prior to joining Manatt, she was head of public finance for the Midwest region for Goldman Sachs, after taking positions as president of private banking for Bank of America 1995–2000, and as head of public sector and infrastructure investment for Goldman Sachs from 2001 to 2010. Staying in California for public sector banking would have likely posed a potential conflict of interest.

Brown is a member of the board of directors for Sempra Energy, owners of Southern California Gas Company responsible for the Aliso Canyon gas leak.

== Personal life ==
She had three children with her first husband, George Rice, then divorced him. Then, she married Van Gordon Sauter, at one time President of CBS News, and they have five grown children. Her dog, named Sutter, was given to Jerry Brown, and became California&#x27;s First Dog in 2011.

<text>StudioCanal S.A.S. (formerly known as Le Studio Canal+, Canal Plus, Canal+ Distribution, Canal+ D.A., and Canal+ Production and also known as StudioCanal International) is a French film &amp; television production and distribution company which is a subsidiary of the Canal+ Group.

, the company has 14 production companies in Europe and the United States, and holds around 9,000 titles in its extensive film library.

== History ==

On 1 January 1987, Canal+ Productions was founded as a cinema film co-production subsidiary of the cable channel which had been established in November 1984, Canal+. The subscription channel was co-founded by André Rousselet and Pierre Lescure. This was to reduce Canal+&#x27;s dependence on the American major studios by building its own library that the pay-TV channel could use on their own channels and internationally.

By December 1990, Canal+ Productions rebranded to Le Studio Canal+, and released its first film, &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot;, by Krzysztof Kieslowski. By the early 1990s, it became apparent that Canal+ was a major contributor to the French film industry, with its obligation to spend 10% of its income on French-made films, as well as being Europe&#x27;s largest buyer of American film rights. Canal+ also made investments in other companies. In 1991 it bought a five percent stake in the independent American studio Carolco Pictures. However, in 1992, Le Studio Canal+ suffered financial difficulties after Carolco Pictures entered a corporate restructure.

StudioCanal&#x27;s most notable productions from its early years include &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, &quot;Under Siege&quot;, &quot;Free Willy&quot;, and the original &quot;Stargate&quot; movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.

Other films the company financed include &quot;U-571&quot;, &quot;Bully&quot;, and &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. StudioCanal also funded the last third of David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (which became the sixth-highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the United States) and &quot;Intimate Strangers.&quot; Films such as &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; which grossed US$519 million, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; which grossed US$352 million and &quot;The Tourist&quot; which grossed US$278 million worldwide, have been big box-office hits for StudioCanal.

In January 1996, Le Studio Canal+ made a $56 million bid for Carolco Pictures&#x27; library. 20th Century Fox, which had originally agreed to buy the library for $50 million, had dropped their bid to $47.5 million and ultimately dropped out of contention, making this acquisition Canal+&#x27;s first foray into library acquisitions.

Le Studio Canal+&#x27;s original plan was to build a pan-European distribution network. They made their first known acquisition into a foreign market in 1997 when they bought a 20% minority stake in Germany&#x27;s Tobis Film; they would later increase the stake to 60% in February 2000, renaming the company Tobis StudioCanal.

On 1 December 1998, all of Canal+ film, television, music, video production activities, etc., were grouped into a new entity, Canal+ Image, which was rebranded as StudioCanal in 2000.

In December 2000, StudioCanal partnered with Italian public broadcasting company RAI to launch a joint venture distribution company in Italy, marking StudioCanal&#x27;s first entry into the Italian film market; the company&#x27;s name was revealed to be 01 Distribution in May 2001.

In July 2001, StudioCanal entered the Spanish film industry by acquiring a 45% stake in Sogepaq from Spanish pay television company Sogecable (Vivendi Universal owned 21% of Sogecable at the time) for $36.2 million, also giving the former a 73% controlling stake in its Spanish subsidiary StudioCanal España and a minority stake in the joint venture Warner Sogefilms. The following month, StudioCanal acquired a 52% stake in French television production powerhouse Expand.

In May 2002, StudioCanal expanded their Italian operations by setting up an in-house production outfit based in Rome named StudioCanal Urania, aiming to produce up to three films annually.

In late-September 2002, StudioCanal announced that they and BAC Majestic had parted ways. Terms of the deal included the sale of their joint venture Mars Distribution to StudioCanal, while BAC Distribution would revert to BAC Majestic.

Staff departures and its parent Vivendi Universal&#x27;s debt forced StudioCanal to gradually sell off their interests in these companies:
* Tobis StudioCanal was subject to a management buyout by CEO Kilian Rebentrost and shareholder Pathé in December 2002 and renamed back to Tobis Film, although the two companies maintained their business relations.
* Sogepaq was sold back to Sogecable in July 2003 for £48 million ($54.2 million).

A year later in 2007, Optimum Home Entertainment and Lionsgate UK acquired Elevation Sales, a home entertainment sales and distribution company.

In August 2007, StudioCanal partnered with NBC Universal&#x27;s international home entertainment division Universal Pictures International Entertainment to launch a joint venture home entertainment distribution subsidiary called Universal Studio Canal Video.

In January 2008, StudioCanal acquired German-based film independent distributor Kinowelt, which had distributed StudioCanal&#x27;s films there until then, marking a re-entry for StudioCanal into the German market.

=== Television series ===
StudioCanal currently owns the rights to over 30 television series, mostly produced by TANDEM Productions and Red Production Company, including &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Public Eye&quot;, &quot;Crazyhead&quot;, &quot;Take Two&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Paddington&quot; (2019), and international rights to &quot;The Big Valley&quot;.

== Distribution ==
Outside France, the British Isles, Australia, New Zealand and Germany, StudioCanal does not have a formal distribution unit &quot;&quot;, instead relying on other distribution studios and home video distributors to handle their titles. In North America for example, The Criterion Collection, Rialto Pictures, Lionsgate Home Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (for the Embassy catalog), Universal Pictures (for co-productions), Shout! Studios and Kino Lorber distribute StudioCanal&#x27;s back catalogue on DVD and Blu-ray Disc (in addition, Anchor Bay Entertainment and Image Entertainment previously owned several of their titles). Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has handled distribution of StudioCanal/Hoyts Distribution films in Australia and New Zealand on DVD and Blu-ray since early 2013.

From the 1990s to early 2000s, Warner Home Video formerly handled distribution of select StudioCanal titles through the &quot;Canal+ Image&quot; label in the United Kingdom on VHS and DVD until 2006 when StudioCanal opened its own distribution unit in the UK, with titles distributed through Optimum Releasing (via Universal Pictures Home Entertainment from 2006 to 2007 and Elevation Sales since 2007).

StudioCanal had the European home video distribution rights to 550 titles from the Miramax library, shared with Lionsgate in the UK and Ireland, from 2011 to 2020, when ViacomCBS bought a minority stake in Miramax.

On 13 October 2021, StudioCanal announced that its global distribution deal with Universal would expire in January 2022.

<text>Lee Hyung-taik (, born 3 January 1976) is a former professional tennis player from South Korea. He won one singles title and achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 36, in August 2007.

==Personal life==
Lee was born in a potato-farming village in Hoengseong County, South Korea. He began playing tennis at age nine with a school teacher. After retirement, he is running his own academy in Gangwon province in the tennis center at Song-ahm Sports Town in Chuncheon named &quot;Lee Hyung Taik Tennis Academy&quot;, which opened on 12 September 2009.

==Tennis career==
===2000===
With the help of Coach Hee June Choi, Lee made a splash at the US Open tournament, reaching the fourth round before losing to Pete Sampras. En route to his fourth-round appearance against Sampras, Lee defeated Jeff Tarango, 13th seed Franco Squillari, and future Australian Open runner-up Rainer Schüttler.

===2003===
In 2003, Lee became the first Korean to win ATP Tour singles and doubles titles by winning the singles tournament at the Sydney International as a qualifier (beating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final) and the doubles tournament at the Siebel Open in San Jose, California (partnering with Belarusian Vladimir Voltchkov).

At Wimbledon, he was defeated in the first round by eventual champion Roger Federer in straight sets.

===2006===
In the second round at Wimbledon, Lee was defeated by former champion and two-time semifinalist Lleyton Hewitt in five sets, including three tie-breakers. Lee had set points in the third set tie-breaker, but went on to lose the set after an incorrect line call. As Lee went on to win the fourth set the call probably prevented him winning the match against the eventual quarterfinalist.

===2007===

Lee matched his best Grand Slam performance by making the fourth round of the US Open tournament. In the first round, he was forced to five sets before defeating Dominik Hrbatý. Lee was pit against Guillermo Cañas, who was the fourteenth seed in the tournament, in the second round. He defeated Cañas in three sets, setting up a third round showdown against nineteenth seed Andy Murray. Lee got out to a quick two set advantage against Murray, eventually winning in four sets. In the fourth round, Lee played fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, who defeated the Korean in three sets.

His fourth round showing at the US Open capped a very successful hardcourt series. During the US Open Series, Lee reached the semifinals at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, the quarterfinals at the Indianapolis Tennis Championships and at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic.

Lee set personal bests in a handful of categories, including match wins and money earned. He won a career-high 25 matches and earned $386,230. Overall, Lee compiled records of 16–15 on hard, 5–5 on clay, 3–3 on grass and 1–0 on carpet. In August, he achieved his career best ranking in singles as world No. 36 with the help of his coach, Hee June Choi.

===2008===
In the 2008 season, Lee had a disappointing losing streak and eventually fell out of the top 100. He did, however, match his best Masters Series result by making the fourth round of Indian Wells, beating Michaël Llodra, Jarkko Nieminen and No. 5 seed David Ferrer along the way.

===2009===
In 2009, Lee played one final time for Korea, in the Davis Cup play-off between Korea and China. He announced his retirement from pro tennis after the Davis Cup match, with Korea triumphing 3–2.

===Doubles===
Lee sometimes played doubles alongside Korean-American player Kevin Kim. The pair reached the third round of the 2005 French Open.

==Playing style==
Lee is right-handed and uses a single-handed backhand. He considers his backhand as his best shot. His favorite surface is hardcourt. He was coached by countryman and former ATP professional Yoon Yong-il (since March 2006).

== ATP career finals==

===Singles: 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)===


===Doubles: 1 (1 title)===


==ATP Challenger and ITF Futures finals==

===Singles: 27 (22–5)===


===Doubles: 22 (14–8)===

<doc id="946334" wikidata="Q149104" url="?curid=946334" title="Holocephali">
<text>Holocephali (&quot;complete heads&quot;), sometimes given the name Euchondrocephali (&quot;true cartilage heads&quot;), is a subclass of cartilaginous fish in the class Chondrichthyes. The earliest fossils are of teeth and come from the Devonian period. The only living holocephalans are the chimaeras (Chimaeriformes), though during the late Paleozoic (Carboniferous and Permian) Holocephali was much more diverse, including an array of forms including those considerably different from modern Chimaeriformes, including shark-like predatory forms and slow, durophagous fish.

Chimaeras, also known as rat fish, or ghost sharks, include three living families and a little over 50 species of surviving holocephalans. These fishes move by using sweeping movements of their large pectoral fins. They are deep sea fish with slender tails, living close to the seabed to feed on benthic invertebrates. They lack a stomach, their food moving directly into the intestine.

==Characteristics==
Members of this taxon preserve today some features of elasmobranch life in Paleozoic times, though in other respects they are aberrant. They live close to the bottom and feed on molluscs and other invertebrates. The tail is long and thin and they move by sweeping movements of the large pectoral fins. The erectile spine in front of the dorsal fin is sometimes venomous. There is no stomach (that is, the gut is simplified and the &#x27;stomach&#x27; is merged with the intestine), and the mouth is a small aperture surrounded by lips, giving the head a parrot-like appearance. The only surviving members of the group are the rabbit fish (&quot;Chimaera&quot;), and the elephant fishes (&quot;Callorhinchus&quot;).

==Evolution==

The fossil record of the Holocephali starts during the Devonian period. The record is extensive, but most fossils are of teeth, and the body forms of numerous species are not known, or at best poorly understood. Some experts further group the orders Petalodontiformes, Iniopterygiformes, and Eugeneodontida into the taxon &quot;Paraselachimorpha&quot;, and treat it as a sister group to Chimaeriformes. However, as almost all members of Paraselachimorpha are poorly understood, most experts suspect this taxon to be either paraphyletic or a wastebasket taxon.

Lund &amp; Grogan (1997) coined the subclass Euchondrocephali to refer to the total group of holocephalians, i.e. all fish more closely related to living holocephalians than to living elasmobranchs such as sharks and rays. Under this classification scheme, &quot;Holocephali&quot; would have a much more restricted definition. Other authors have used Holocephali in a broad sense covering all fish more closely related to chimaeras than to sharks and rays.

Based on genetic research, it is estimated the Holocephali split from the Elasmobranchii (the branch of chondrichthyans containing true sharks and rays) about 421 million years ago.

While historically considered closely related to elasmobranchs, recent studies have found members of the shark-like &quot;symmoriiformes&quot;, which may be paraphyletic, to be early diverging relatives of Holocephali, (with some of these studies choosing to exclude them from Holocephali proper).

<doc id="946337" wikidata="Q2017294" url="?curid=946337" title="Okkervil River">
<text>Okkervil River is an American rock band led by singer-songwriter Will Sheff. Formed in Austin, Texas, in 1998, the band takes its name from a short story by Russian author Tatyana Tolstaya set on the river Okkervil in Saint Petersburg. They began as a trio made up of Sheff and friends he had met in his native state of New Hampshire but, over time, have gone through many lineups.

Okkervil River self-released their first album, &quot;Stars Too Small to Use,&quot; which led them to the South by Southwest music festival. After recording their first album in a garage, they signed with Jagjaguwar. They continued by releasing four more albums, including the critically lauded concept album &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot;.

After a period of touring for &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot;, Okkervil River followed up with &quot;The Stage Names&quot;. The album sold 10,000 in its opening week in the United States. The group released a free covers album, &quot;Golden Opportunities Mixtape&quot; from their live performances.

The band has garnered positive critical reception.
They have appeared on the talk show &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and have performed with acts such as The Decemberists, The New Pornographers, The National, and Lou Reed.

Okkervil River released the album &quot;The Stand Ins&quot; in 2008. They promoted the release with a series of cover songs from the album on YouTube by people they&#x27;ve met as a band. Their 2010 collaboration as a backing band with psychedelic rocker Roky Erickson yielded &quot;True Love Cast Out All Evil&quot;. In 2011, Okkervil River released their sixth full-length album, &quot;I Am Very Far&quot;, which peaked at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band released their seventh album, &quot;The Silver Gymnasium&quot;, in 2013. The album peaked at No. 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. This was followed by the album, &quot;Away,&quot; which was released in 2016 on ATO Records. Their ninth album, &quot;In the Rainbow Rain&quot;, was released by ATO in 2018.

== History ==

=== Formation ===

Okkervil River&#x27;s founding members became friends at Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire, and after parting ways for college moved to Austin, Texas to live together and start a band. The band consisted of singer-songwriter Will Sheff, Zach Thomas on bass and mandolin, and Seth Warren on drums. Their first gig was at Steamboat in Austin on January 11, 1999.

=== &quot;Bedroom EP&quot; and &quot;Stars Too Small to Use&quot; ===
In 1998, the group self-released their first disc, &quot;Bedroom EP&quot;. Over the course of two weekends in the summer of 1999, they recorded a seven-song self-released album titled &quot;Stars Too Small to Use&quot;, with recording engineer Jeff Hoskins.

They met Jonathan Meiburg at a gig with his band Whu Gnu at the Waterloo Brewing Company on December 3, 1999. Meiburg subsequently joined the band on accordion and later on pianos and organs.

On the strength of &quot;Stars Too Small to Use&quot;, Okkervil River was admitted into the 2000 SXSW music festival. Their first major press was a SXSW feature article in the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; on March 3, 2000.

=== &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with Everyone You See&quot; and &quot;Down the River of Golden Dreams&quot; ===

The band met recording engineer and producer Brian Beattie at their SXSW showcase on March 18, 2000, and soon agreed to make a record together. They spent much of the rest of that year working on &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with Everyone You See&quot;. Warren moved to Berkeley, California in December and was replaced on drums by Mark Pedini.

By the time of that year&#x27;s SXSW festival, Okkervil River had received interest in their new record from the Bloomington, Indiana-based record label Jagjaguwar. The record was released on Jagjaguwar on January 22, 2002.

One year later the band traveled to San Francisco and reunited with Warren to record their third album at Tiny Telephone Studios with engineer Scott Solter at the console. Jagjaguwar released &quot;Down the River of Golden Dreams&quot; on September 2, 2003.

In 2003, Pedini left the band to pursue his graphic design work, leaving Okkervil River without a drummer for that year&#x27;s SXSW. They invited Travis Nelsen, fresh off a tour filling in on drums for sister labelmates Secretly Canadian&#x27;s Swearing at Motorists, to perform with them. He soon became the band&#x27;s full-time drummer. The next year, during a long bout of touring, the band added keyboardist and lap-steel player Howard Draper as a fifth member.

=== &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot;, &quot;The Stage Names&quot; and &quot;The Stand Ins&quot; ===

In August 2004, the band began recording with Beattie again, finally putting the finishing touches on their third full-length album, &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot; in November. It was released on April 5, 2005. As a result of the album&#x27;s critical success, Okkervil River followed up with an EP entitled &quot;Black Sheep Boy Appendix&quot; on November 22, 2005. This was the first recording with Draper, horn and keyboardist Scott Brackett, guitarist Brian Cassidy, and touring bassist Pat Pestorius, who eventually replaced Zach Thomas in the band. The band signed to Virgin/EMI in Europe and the label re-released &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Black Sheep Boy Appendix&quot; as a double disc on April 28, 2006. Jagjaguwar eventually followed suit, releasing the &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; with extra songs and videos.

&quot;The Stage Names&quot;, their fourth full-length studio album (produced again by Beattie), was released on August 7, 2007. The disc features the line-up that toured extensively on &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot; and the &quot;Black Sheep Boy Appendix&quot;, with Cassidy replacing Draper who joined Shearwater. The album was met with critical acclaim and debuted at number 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 10,000 copies sold.

Okkervil River released their fifth album &quot;The Stand Ins&quot; on September 9, 2008. In its first week, the album charted at No. 42 with 11,000 copies sold, according to the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On December 12, 2007, the band freely released a nine-song mixtape entitled &quot;Golden Opportunities Mixtape&quot; via their website. These recordings, along with the upcoming appendix, are the first to feature contributions from new touring keyboardist, Justin Sherburn, who joined the band in November 2007.

In 2008 guitarist Brian Cassidy stepped down from the band as a full-time touring member and was temporarily replaced by Charles Bissell of The Wrens for their spring and summer tours. Bissell was later replaced by Lauren Gurgiolo, singer and songwriter of the Austin, Texas band The Dialtones. After performing on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in early 2009, the &quot;Pop Lie&quot; single was released backed with the b-sides &quot;Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Pop Lie (One Man Band Version)&quot;.

=== &quot;I Am Very Far&quot; &amp; &quot;The Silver Gymnasium&quot; ===

Okkervil River&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;I Am Very Far&quot;, was released on May 10, 2011. To promote the album, the band went on tour in 2011 with Titus Andronicus, Julianna Barwick, Future Islands and NewVillager. In September 2013 Okkervil River released their seventh album, &quot;The Silver Gymnasium&quot;, the content of which is inspired by Sheff&#x27;s childhood and hometown.

=== &quot;Away&quot; ===

&quot;Away&quot;, the band&#x27;s eighth album, was released on September 9, 2016. The album features a new backing band and sonic direction, including contributions from Marissa Nadler, Jonathan Meiburg and members of the classical group yMusic. The content of the album is largely based on Will Sheff&#x27;s life during the 2013–2015 period after the release of The Silver Gymnasium, during which many members of the band left and his grandfather died.

=== &quot;In the Rainbow Rain&quot; ===
&quot;In the Rainbow Rain&quot; was released on April 27, 2018, and marks the ninth album for the band. Will Sheff produced the album while Shawn Everett (Perfume Genius, Alabama Shakes, The War on Drugs) assumed mixing responsibilities.
The writing process incorporated Sheff&#x27;s songwriting craftsmanship with an interplay of his new bandmates, Benjamin Lazar Davis (bass), Will Graefe (guitar), Lip Talk (Sarah K. Pedinotti) (keys) and Cully Symington (percussion) – the same iteration of Okkervil River that joined Sheff on the Away tour.

Sheff and the band started work on the new album shortly after the end of that tour – and the presidential election. &quot;If December 2016 was good for anything, it was good for writing songs&quot;, he said. Sheff took a different approach to the album, sometimes co-writing with his new band, and occasionally attending local Quaker meetings.

== Other projects ==
In 2001, Meiburg and Sheff founded a second band known as Shearwater. Originally an outlet for Meiburg songs and some Sheff songs that didn&#x27;t fit the Okkervil mold, Shearwater has gradually evolved into a full-fledged band. The band&#x27;s 2006 release, &quot;Palo Santo&quot; (sans Sheff&#x27;s vocals, but including his musical input), has seen Meiburg receive great critical acclaim. The groups still share many fans, and, while on tour together in 2004, they released a limited edition split-CD entitled &quot;Sham Wedding/Hoax Funeral&quot;. In 2008, Meiburg left Okkervil River to focus exclusively on Shearwater.

On April 20, 2010, former 13th Floor Elevators singer-guitarist Roky Erickson released the album &quot;True Love Cast Out All Evil&quot;, produced by Will Sheff and backed by Okkervil River.

Okkervil River&#x27;s &quot;Unless it Kicks&quot; was featured in the 2013 film &quot;A Birder&#x27;s Guide to Everything.&quot;

Okkervil River also performed &quot;Candle on the Water&quot; for the 2016 remake of &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;.

<doc id="946346" wikidata="Q446094" url="?curid=946346" title="American Lung Association">
<text>The American Lung Association is a voluntary health organization whose mission is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease through education, advocacy and research.

==History==

=== 1904–1918: Founding ===
The organization was founded in 1904 to fight tuberculosis (TB) as the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT) by Edward Livingston Trudeau, Robert Hall Babcock, Henry Martyn Hall, Lawrence Flick, and S. Adolphus Knopf. Earlier in 1892, Flick had founded the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, the world&#x27;s first society dedicated to the preventing TB. In 1907, the Lung Association began their Christmas Seal campaign to raise money for a small TB sanatorium in Delaware. Emily Bissell, a Red Cross volunteer at the time, created holiday seals to sell at the post office for a penny a piece. By the end of her fundraising campaign, she had raised more than ten times the amount needed to save the sanatorium, and the tradition of Christmas Seals was launched.

=== 1918–1973 ===
The NASPT was renamed the National Tuberculosis Association (NTA) in 1918, and then the National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association (NTRDA) in 1968; it adopted its current name in 1973.

=== 1973–2018 ===
The association is a defender of the Clean Air Act.

In October 2018, the association launched its school-based initiative, &quot;Yoga Power&quot;, a program designed to increase awareness of the importance of lung health, at Woodward Elementary School in Delaware, Ohio.

==Logo and tagline==
A modified version of the Cross of Lorraine serves as the Lung Association&#x27;s logo. The Paris, France, physician Gilbert Sersiron suggested its use in 1902 as a symbol for the &quot;crusade&quot; against tuberculosis. The double barred cross was originally used in the coat of arms of Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine, a leader of the first crusade and elected ruler of Jerusalem after its capture in 1099.

The national tagline &quot;Fighting for Air&quot; was introduced in 2010 to emphasize the organization&#x27;s role in reducing particulate pollution in the atmosphere and in public places. While the Cross of Lorraine was colored red since its adoption, it was changed to blue in 2021.

==Funding==
The American Lung Association is a public health organization funded by contributions from individual donors, corporations, foundations and government agency grants. One of its best-known fundraising campaigns is its Christmas Seals program, which has been an annual fundraising and public awareness tool for tuberculosis and lung disease since 1907.

The Lake Tour Bike Trek is an annual bicycle ride held at Illinois in early June with all donations going towards the American Lung Association of Illinois. The Trek Across Maine, a similar bicycle ride in Maine, has raised more than $24 million since 1985.

==Notable participants==
The National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis held their ninth annual meeting in Washington, D.C., May 8 and 9, 1913. In attendance were Association President Homer Folks, Honorary Vice President Theodore Roosevelt, Vice Presidents Robert Hall Babcock, Sir William Osler and Edward R. Baldwin, Treasurer William H. Baldwin, Secretary Henry Barton Jacobs. Notable life members included Andrew Carnegie, Henry C. Frick, Mrs. H. Knickerbocker, Louis Marshall, Francis E. May, Cyrus H. McCormick, Henry Phipps, John D. Rockefeller, Rodman Wanamaker, Felix M. Warburg. The association members recommended a public health committee be formed by The National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis and be officially sanctioned by the United States House of Representatives. In addition, they adopted the double red cross emblem formally as the symbol for the association and its fight against tuberculosis. The National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis executive offices were located at 105 East 22nd Street, New York, New York.
Henry Martyn Hall of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is one of the ten original founders and was honored at the 50th Anniversary Annual Meeting of the National Tuberculosis Association at Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1954. U.S. President Grover Cleveland was an honorary vice president from 1905 to 1908; U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was an honorary vice president from 1905 to 1919.

<text>Samsonite International S.A. is an American luggage manufacturer and retailer, with products ranging from large suitcases to small toiletries bags and briefcases. The company was founded in 1910 in Denver, Colorado, United States.
Its registered office is in Luxembourg and it is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

== History ==
The company was founded in Denver, Colorado, on March 10, 1910, by Black Hawk, Colorado-born luggage salesman Jesse Shwayder (1882–1970) as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company. A religious man, Shwayder named one of his initial cases Samson, after the Biblical strongman, and began using the trademark &quot;Samsonite&quot; in 1941 for its tapered vulcanized fiber suitcase, introduced in 1939. In 1965, after the Samsonite suitcase became its best-selling product, the company changed its name to SAMSONITE. For many years the subsidiary SAMSONITE Furniture Co. made folding chairs and card tables in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

The Shwayder family sold the company to Beatrice Foods in 1973. In 1974, the company released the brand&#x27;s first wheeled suitcase. 

Samsonite operated with relative independence within Beatrice until 1986, when Samsonite was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Subsequently, in the 1980s and into the 1990s, Samsonite went through multiple ownership changes. Forbes Magazine states that &quot;the company spent most of the 1980s and 1990s in turmoil amidst multiple handoffs.&quot; First, Samsonite was spun off from KKR as part of E-II, which came under the control of Fortune Brands. E-II went through bankruptcy and was renamed Astrum International. In 1993, Astrum purchased American Tourister luggage, complementing Samsonite. In 1995, Astrum split, and an independent Samsonite (now including American Tourister) was once again headquartered in Denver. The Denver factory, which employed 4,000 people at its peak, closed in May 2001. 

After a change of ownership in May 2005, Samsonite&#x27;s headquarters moved from Denver to Mansfield, Massachusetts. Effective September 1, 2005, Samsonite then moved its U.S. marketing and sales offices from Warren, Rhode Island, to Mansfield, Massachusetts.

In 2005, the company was acquired by Marcello Bottoli, former CEO of Louis Vuitton, to pull it out of a long slump. Bottoli left the company in 2009.


In July 2007, private equity firm CVC Capital Partners took over Samsonite for $1.7 billion. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. became Samsonite&#x27;s fifth owner in 21 years.

On September 2, 2009, Samsonite Company Store LLC (U.S. retail division), formally known as Samsonite Company Stores Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It planned to close up to 50% of its stores and discontinue the &quot;Black Label&quot; brand in the United States.

In June 2011, Samsonite raised $1.25 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong.

In August 2012, Samsonite paid $35 million in cash to buy the high-end luggage brand Hartmann, which was founded in 1877.

In June 2014, Samsonite agreed to buy technical outdoor backpack brand Gregory Mountain Products from Black Diamond, Inc., for $85 million in cash.

In March 2016, Samsonite agreed to buy luxury baggage maker Tumi Inc. for $1.8 billion in its largest ever acquisition.

In April 2017, Samsonite agreed to acquire eBags.com for $105 million in cash.

In 2023, Samsonite was rated the best overall luggage for travelers by Good Housekeeping Magazine.

In September 2023, Bloomberg reported that Samsonite was exploring the possibility of a second listing in the U.S. as the luggage maker looked to broaden its investor base.

== Toy manufacture ==
Beginning in 1961, Samsonite manufactured and distributed Lego building toys for the North American market under license from the Lego Group. A licensing dispute ended the arrangement in the U.S. in 1972, but Samsonite remained the distributor in Canada until 1986. Albert H. Reckler, then head of military and export sales for the luggage division, brought the idea of manufacturing and selling Lego in the U.S. to Samsonite. He and Stan A. Clamage were instrumental in establishing the Lego brand in the United States. This was part of an overall company expansion into toy manufacturing in the 1960s that was abandoned in the 1970s.

== Production ==
In 2008, 40% of all Samsonite hard luggage was manufactured at its plant in Nashik, India. 

Samsonite has two assembly plants in Hungary.

In 2022, Samsonite announced plans to move production to Japan. 

In April 2023, Samsonite announced plans to expand its manufacturing in Nashik as the demand for travel has increased. Samsonite India plans to invest ₹1,100,000,000 –1,150,000,000 to enhance its hard luggage manufacturing capacity from 500,000 pieces a month to 750,000 pieces by the end of the following year. The expansion will include 180,000 square feet of land for the plant to expand on.

<text>East Timor (Timor-Leste) competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, which was held from 13 to 29 August. The nation&#x27;s appearance at the 2004 Athens Games marked its official debut in any Olympic event and also the Summer Olympics. 

Two track and field athletes, Gil da Cruz Trindade and Agueda Amaral, were selected to represent the nation via wildcards, as the nation had no athletes that met either the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; qualifying standards in their respective events, the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s marathons. At 32 years and 88 days, Amaral became the oldest athlete to represent the nation at the Summer Games, which still stands today. She was also selected as the nation&#x27;s first flag bearer for the opening ceremony. 

Ultimately, neither athlete won a medal in their events, with Trindade not even finishing his marathon. This therefore meant that East Timor won no medals in the Athens Games.

==Background==
Although this was the official Summer Olympics debut for East Timor, East Timorese athletes had competed as individual Olympic athletes in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Because the athletes did not win a medal at the previous Olympics, no athlete from the nation had won a medal prior to the 2004 Athens Games.

The National Olympic Committee of East Timor (NOC) selected two athletes via wildcards. Usually, a NOC would be able to enter up to three qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the &quot;A&quot; standard, or one athlete per event if they met the &quot;B&quot; standard.

<text>Neagu Bunea Djuvara (; 18 August 1916 – 25 January 2018) was a Romanian historian, essayist, philosopher, journalist, novelist, and diplomat.

==Biography==

===Early life===
A native of Bucharest, he was descended from an aristocratic Aromanian family. His father, Marcel, a graduate of the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin) and a captain in the Romanian Royal Army&#x27;s Engineer Corps, died of the Spanish flu in 1918; his mother, Tinca, was the last descendant of the Grădișteanu family of boyar origins (according to Djuvara, she was related to all boyar families in Wallachia). Djuvara&#x27;s uncles Trandafir and Alexandru Djuvara were notable public figures. Djuvara was born during World War I; as an infant, he was taken by his family into refuge in Iași after the occupation of southern Romania by the Central Powers, and then, through Imperial Russia, into Belgium, where Trandafir Djuvara was Minister Plenipotentiary.

He attended &quot;lycée&quot; in Nice, France, and graduated in Letters (1937) and Law (1940) from the University of Paris (his Law thesis dealt with the antisemitic legislation passed by the governments of King Carol II in Romania). Djuvara later stated that, at the time, his political sympathies veered towards the far right: he became a supporter of the Romanian fascist movement, the Iron Guard, and took part in the February 1934 riot against the French Radical-Socialist government of Édouard Daladier.

During World War II, he returned to Romania, where he married and fathered a daughter. He joined the Romanian Armed Forces and was stationed in Ploiești under the Iron Guard&#x27;s National Legionary government.

Following the establishment of Ion Antonescu&#x27;s dictatorship and the start of Operation Barbarossa (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;), as an officer cadet, he fought on the Eastern Front, saw action in Bassarabia and Transnistria, before being wounded in the arm during the Battle of Odessa (1941). He stated that he gave up his interest in the far right after a 1943 dialog with fellow diplomat Victor Rădulescu-Pogoneanu, who convinced Djuvara to become &quot;a supporter of parliamentary democracy&quot;.

===Diplomat===
Subsequently, Djuvara decided to apply for office in the diplomatic corps, won the competition, and was sent by Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu as a diplomatic courier to Sweden, on the very day Ion Antonescu was toppled by a coup d&#x27;état and Romania pulled out of the Axis Powers to join the Allies (August 23, 1944). In this capacity, he was instructed to communicate to the Romanian Ambassador in Stockholm, Frederic Nanu, that he was to ask the Soviet representative Alexandra Kollontai whether earlier terms advanced by Joseph Stalin in regard to peace with Romania were still valid (Nanu was also told not to inform the Western Allies of these talks).

Speaking in retrospect, he argued against claims made by Nanu, according to which Ion Antonescu had thus indicated his willingness to step down and hand leadership of Romania to King Mihai I. According to Djuvara, the last Soviet offer for Antonescu made only minor concessions – the entire country was to be occupied by the Red Army, with the exception of a random western county (to function as a provisional administrative center), and 15 days were given to the Romanian government to reach an armistice with Nazi Germany (Djuvara considered this latter expectation particularly unrealistic, as it involved Germany consciously abandoning Romanian territory to its enemy). Furthermore, Djuvara indicated, &quot;Neither I nor Nanu were mandated to sign any document, to launch into any peace process&quot;.

Appointed Legation Secretary in Stockholm by the Constantin Sănătescu executive, Djuvara was dismissed by the new Romanian Communist Party officials upon Ana Pauker&#x27;s appointment as Foreign Minister (1947).

===Exile===
Having been implicated &quot;in absentia&quot; in the series of show trials inaugurated in the wake of Communist Romania by the Tămădău Affair, accused of being a spy, he decided to remain abroad. He left for Paris and was subsequently involved in advocacy of anti-communist political causes and the rallying of exiled intellectuals. Briefly employed by the International Refugee Organization, Djuvara became involved with the body of Romanian exiles, the Romanian National Committee, and helped organize American-assisted drops of voluntary paratroopers in support of the Romanian anti-communist resistance (most of whom were captured by the Securitate). He renounced his position by 1951, and subsequently worked for the exile magazine &quot;Casa Românească&quot;.

In 1961, he settled in Niger, serving as an adviser for the country&#x27;s Foreign Ministry (extending a two-year contract until 1984), and was a professor of International Law and Economic History at the University of Niamey. Djuvara was an acquaintance of President Hamani Diori, and notably accompanied him on official duty to Addis Ababa, attending the opening session of the Organisation of African Unity (1963). Having already begun to further his studies of philosophy in Paris, he received a Sorbonne &quot;doctorat d&#x27;État&quot; in the Philosophy of history (with the thesis &quot;Civilisations et lois historiques&quot;, guided by Raymond Aron). He was later awarded a diploma in Philology from INALCO.

After 1984, he returned to Europe, resuming his activities with &quot;Casa Românească&quot; and other Romanian cultural institutions in exile. Djuvara was an active contributor to Radio Free Europe, and divided his time between Paris and Munich (occasionally traveling to Canada and the United States).

===Post-1989===
Djuvara returned to his native country soon after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Between 1991 and 1998, he was an associate professor at the University of Bucharest. During the early 1990s, he was a noted critic of Romanian political developments, and especially of the Mineriad and the National Salvation Front government.

He later joined the National Liberal Party, and expressed his concern that President Traian Băsescu was unable to complete planned reforms in the wake of Romania&#x27;s accession to the European Union, as well as his belief that the former Securitate was still in a position of power. He also took a conservative stance on European affairs, being a vocal critic of Europe&#x27;s multiculturalism. In August 2016, Djuvara turned 100, and upon the occasion was made a knight of the Order of the Star of Romania. His last public appearance was on December 5, 2017, when in an interview, he expressed his grief over the demise of King Michael. He died from pneumonia in Bucharest on 25 January 2018, at the age of 101 years and 147 days, and was buried at Bellu Cemetery.

Djuvara was survived by his daughter, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters. Most of his works in Romanian were published by Humanitas.

==Work as a historian==
Most of Djuvara&#x27;s work concerns the history of Romania and that of the Romanian people, although he published significant works pertaining to the philosophy of history, particularly questioning the existence of what he called &quot;truthful history&quot;.

Regarding Romanian history, Djuvara advocated continued and extensive research into what he believed was still unexplored territory. His views were often seen as undermining a Romanian national identity, mainly because of his expressing doubts on the scientific accuracy of most historic research done in Romania since the unification of 1918, and putting forward controversial hypotheses concerning the origin of the Romanians, such as advancing the theory that the vast majority of the nobility in the medieval states that made up the territory of modern-day Romania was of Cuman origin.

He also published extensively regarding the relationship between his native Romania and Europe, placing the country politically and culturally &quot;between East and West&quot;, citing it as the &quot;last to enter what is commonly called the &quot;European concert&quot;&quot;, referring not to Romania&#x27;s 2007 accession to the European Union, but to the country&#x27;s change of orientation towards adopting a Western political and cultural model. He has voiced his concern regarding multiculturalism in Europe, a policy which he views as detrimental to stability within the EU.

He was a critic of what he perceived to be an excessively pro-Western attitude in Romanian politics, suggesting that Romanian society and culture could not be classified as Western, citing Orthodoxy as the predominant religion, the presence of many non-Latin elements in the modern Romanian language and the country&#x27;s history in the past centuries as arguments.

He also wrote about what he called the &quot;American hegemony&quot; and its premises, analysing the influence which the United States and its foreign policy have had on the world and, more specifically, on Europe. He characterised the efforts of the United States to establish what resembles a hegemony in Europe and other parts of the world as a &quot;Seventy-Seven Years&#x27; War&quot; waged throughout most of the 20th century.

Djuvara can be seen as a populariser and &quot;de-mystifier&quot; of history, having published books aimed a younger audience as well as books seeking to explain the historical basis for mythical figures such as Dracula or Negru Vodă. He also published memories from his exile, recounting his life and work in Paris, France, and Niamey, Niger.

Djuvara has claimed that Romanian marshal Ion Antonescu, who ruled Romania during World War II, was in fact an Albanian of Romania or, as he called him, an . Romanian historian Ion Teodorescu agrees with this view.

<text>The Aermacchi MB-339 is a military jet trainer and light attack aircraft designed and manufactured by Italian aviation company Aermacchi.

The MB-339 was developed during the 1970s in response to an Italian Air Force requirement that sought a replacement for the service&#x27;s existing fleet of Aermacchi MB-326s. Its design was derived from that of the MB-326, rather than a new design, and thus the two aircraft share considerable similarities in terms of their design. Aermacchi had found that the MB-339 was capable of satisfying all of the specified requirements while being the most affordable option available. The maiden flight of the MB-339 took place on 12 August 1976; the first production aircraft were delivered two years later.

Roughly half of all MB-339s entered service with the Italian Air Force, while the remainder have been sold to various export customers. As well as being used for training, the type is also flown by the Frecce Tricolori aerobatic display team. The type has been used in combat by both the Eritrean Air Force during the Eritrean–Ethiopian War of 1998–2000 and the Argentine Naval Aviation during the Falklands War of 1982. In both conflicts, the MB-339 was typically flown as an attack aircraft. In Italian service, the aircraft is intended to be replaced by the newer Aermacchi M-345.

==Development==
During September 1972, Aermacchi was awarded a contract to study a replacement for the Italian Air Force&#x27;s aging MB-326 fleet, a type which had effectively been the standard advanced jet trainer of the 1960s. During this study, designers at the company compared seven all-new designs (which were collectively referred to by the designation of &quot;MB-338&quot;) against an improved version of the MB-326, which was designated &quot;MB-339&quot;. It was determined that the envisioned MB-339 would be capable to satisfying the established requirements of the Italian Air Force, while also being cheaper than producing any of the rival clean-sheet designs. Accordingly, Aermacchi submitted the MB-339 for official evaluation; during 1975, it was selected to replace both the MB-326 and the Fiat G.91T fleets that were then in Italian service.

On 12 August 1976, the maiden flight of the prototype, designated &quot;MB-339X&quot;, took place. During July 1978, the first production-standard aircraft made its first flight; during the following year, deliveries of the &quot;MB-339A&quot; to the Italian Air Force commenced. The service would be the primary operator of the type; reportedly, between 1978 and 1987, 101 MB-339As would be induced into the Italian Air Force, which is roughly just under half of the total examples of the type to have been constructed to date.

Various improved models would be developed by Aermacchi. During 1980, a dedicated single-seat attack variant, referred to as the &quot;MB-339K Veltro II&quot;, performed its maiden flight. During 1985, the &quot;MB-339B&quot;, which incorporated a light-attack capability, entered operational service. That same year, the first &quot;MB-339C&quot;, which featured various refinements and was intended as a dual-use aircraft, made its first flight. During the late 1980s, the enhanced MB-339C was made available to customers; this model principally differed from preceding variants via the implementation of a much-modernised cockpit. Early on, the Italian government chose to procure the MB-339CD; in addition to the fully digital cockpit, this variant was furnished with a fixed probe for aerial refueling, enabling its use for refueling training.

During 1989, Aermacchi formed a partnership with American defense conglomerate Lockheed and the aircraft division of General Motors to jointly bid in the American Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) programme. The Italian-American team proposed a modified model of the MB-339, referred to as the &quot;T-Bird II&quot;, to contend for the competition. If successful, Lockheed would have acted as the prime contractor and system integrator, assembling the T-Bird II at its Marietta facility, while General Motors was to provide its computerised training experience. However, the bid was ultimately not successful; instead, a rival turboprop-powered submission by Raytheon and Pilatus was awarded the contract to produce the T-6 Texan II for this requirement.

Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, multiple tranches of the MB-339CD variant would be inducted into Italian service. Furthermore, various operators chose to have their existing aircraft remanufactured to the more advanced MB-339C standard. During the 2000s, the &quot;MB-339FD&quot; (&quot;FD&quot; standing for &quot;Full Digital&quot;), was proposed but ultimately attracted little market interest. During 2006, it was announced that the MB-339 assembly line, which had been shuttered for several years, would be revived in response to interest in further orders of the type being expressed by three separate customers.

During the 1990s and 2000s, as a result of corporate mergers and restructuring, the MB-339 became only one of several training aircraft being offered by Aermacchi, other aircraft being propeller-driven SF-260, the basic S.211, M-311, and the M-346. According to company Giorgio Brazzelli, its various training platforms come together to form part of an integrated training system to its customers.

==Design==
The Aermacchi MB-339 is a military jet trainer and light attack aircraft, featuring a conventional configuration, tricycle undercarriage and all-metal construction. It has many similarities with the design of the MB-326, sharing the majority of its airframe with the older aircraft. According to aviation periodical Air International, the most significant revision of the MB-339 was a redesigned forward fuselage, which raised the instructor&#x27;s seat to allow visibility over and past the student pilot&#x27;s head. In typical operations, the aircraft is flown by a crew of two, who are seated in a tandem configuration; during training missions, the student is seated in the forward position while the observing instructor is placed directly behind and somewhat above them. The cockpit is pressurised and is covered by a jettisonable canopy which works in conjunction with the twin Martin-Baker-built ejection seats.

The MB-339 possesses a low, un-swept wing complete with tip tanks; the air intakes for the single turbojet engine is located within the wing roots. This wing is identical to that used on the older MB-326K model. The powerplant used for the aircraft&#x27;s initial versions was the Rolls-Royce Viper 632-43 turbojet engine, which was capable of producing a maximum thrust of 4,000 lbf (17.8 kN); this is the same model as installed upon the older MB-326K model. Later models, such as the MB-339C, are furnished with the more powerful &quot;Viper 680&quot; engine, which can generate up to 4,300 lbf (19.57 kN) of thrust. For improved aerodynamics, the MB-339 features an enlarged tailfin over its predecessor.

While some models of the MB-339 are primarily intended for training operations, other are instead principally equipped to perform light fighter and fighter-bomber roles. Combat-orientated aircraft are typically outfitted with more advanced avionics, such as improved inertial guidance systems, digital nav/attack computers, a MIL-STD-1553B databus, and hands-on throttle-and-stick (HOTAS)-compatible flight controls. Furthermore, various defensive systems, such as a radio jammer, radar warning receiver (RWR), electronic countermeasures (ECM), along with larger wingtip tanks, would typically be adopted. The MB-339K carries a pair of 30mm DEFA cannon while a total of six underwing hard points can accommodate up to 1,815 kilograms (4,000 lb) of external stores. It has been qualified to be armed with various munitions, such as the Sidewinder and R.550 Magic air-to-air missiles, the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile, various laser-guided bombs and rockets, as well as the Marte Mk.2 anti-ship missile. According to Forecast International, Aermacchi had at one point considered making provisions for the installation of an additional two pod-mounted 30mm cannon.

==Operational history==

===General use===

The Italian Air Force is the largest operator of the MB-339. The service, which received its first examples during 1978, has procured multiple batches and models of the type over the years; for several decades, it has been flown as its principal trainer aircraft. In addition to its use as a general trainer, the MB-339 is also flown by the &quot;Frecce Tricolori&quot; aerobatic display team; during 1988, three aircraft were lost during a tragic air display accident in Germany.

In October 2013, it was announced that the Italian Air Force intended to replace its MB-339s with newly built M-345s in the long term. The M-345 is intended to replace Italian Air Force MB-339s as a basic trainer, and with the &quot;Frecce Tricolori&quot;.

Many of its operators, such as the Royal New Zealand Air Force, chose to procure the type during the 1980s and 1990s as a replacement for various aging jet-powered attack aircraft, such as the British-built BAC Strikemaster. Although uncommon amongst most export customers, some operators, such as the United Arab Emirates, have chosen to have several aircraft furnished for aerobatic displays. Emirates aerobatics display team, Al Fursan, operates 7 MB-339A of which 6 were modified to MB-339NAT since 2010. According to a report by Forecast International published in 2014, the later-built MB-339CD model has remained viable as a training platform for various newer fighter aircraft, such as the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon; however, the type&#x27;s appeal is waning and shall largely be confined after the 2010s to those nations with weaker economies or facing little military pressure.

===Combat use===

====Argentina====

The Argentine Naval Aviation (&quot;&quot; or COAN) was the first foreign user of the forerunner MB-326GB, purchasing a batch of eight aircraft during 1969.

During 1980, the COAN ordered ten MB-339As advanced trainer and light attack aircraft. These were delivered in 1981 and were operated by the &quot;III Escuadra Naval&quot;″s 1 &quot;Escuadrilla de Ataque&quot;. During the Falklands War, late in April 1982, six of them were located at Port Stanley Airport, renamed &quot;Base Aérea Militar&quot; (BAM) Malvinas. They were the only attack jets to operate from the Falklands, along with four Beech T-34 Turbo-Mentor light attack and trainer aircraft, and twenty-four turboprop FMA IA 58 Pucará attack aircraft of &quot;Grupo 3 de Ataque&quot;. Other Aermacchis were operated from three mainland bases, these being Almirante Zar, Bahía Blanca, and Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego naval air stations.

On 3 May 1982, Lieutenant Benitez crashed into high ground while approaching the airport at Port Stanley, and was killed. On 21 May an MB-339A flown by Lieutenant Owen Crippa on a reconnaissance flight attacked the Royal Navy amphibious force. The Aermacchi hit the frigate , causing light damage. On 27 May, an MB-339A (4-A-114) was shot down by a Blowpipe missile during the Battle for Goose Green, while attempting to attack British ships and landed troops. The pilot, Lieutenant Miguel, was killed. Three MB-339 airframes were captured by the British, with one of these preserved at the South Yorkshire Aircraft Museum, Doncaster.

====Eritrea====
During tensions between Eritrea and Ethiopia in the late 1990s, Eritrea started to rebuild its air force. During 1996, the Eritreans ordered six Aermacchi MB-339CEs, with which the first combat unit of the ERAF was founded in 1997. They have proved their worth as training aircraft and even during the early fighting in 1998.

Their initial deployment occurred on 5 June 1998, the same day in which the Ethiopian Air Force (ETAF) also started its operations. During the same afternoon, the Ethiopians reported two attacks of Eritrean MB-339FDs on the city of Mekelle, the capital of the Ethiopian region of Tigray. Reportedly, as many as 44 civilians were killed and 135 injured.

However, on 6 June one of the MB-339s was shot down north of Mekelle. The pilot ejected and was either rescued by a Mi-8 of the ERAF or was captured by local militia. The surviving Eritrean Aermacchis were deployed again on the next day during the fighting around Erde Mattios.

On the morning of 12 June 1998, a pair of Eritrean Mil Mi-8 appeared in low level over Addis Pharmaceutical works, in Adigrat, attempting to bomb it. Their weapons, however, fell a few yards from the plant and caused only minor damage. Only a couple of hours later, four MB-339s rocketed and cluster-bombed against several targets in the city as well. According to Ethiopian sources, four people died and 30 other were injured during those attacks.

On 5 February 1999, the Ethiopian government claimed that a pair of Eritrean MB-339FDs had attacked a fuel depot in Adigrat, some 48 kilometres inside the Ethiopian border, which was important for supplying fuel to the Ethiopian Army.

<text>Wadala (also spelled Vadala, formerly spelt Wuddala, ) is a neighborhood in Mumbai. Wadala Road is a station on the Harbour Line of Mumbai&#x27;s railway network.

== Overview ==
Wadala has several schools and some renowned institutions like Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Institute of Chemical Technology (erstwhile UDCT)), Vidyalankar Institute of Technology (VIT), South Indians&#x27; Welfare Society College (SIWS), St.Joseph&#x27;s High School, and Auxilium Convent High School located near one another. SNDT Women&#x27;s University, Dr. Ambedkar Commerce &amp; Law College also has a campus in Wadala West. The local college of Wadala is SIWS near the Wadala station. The largest bus depot in Mumbai, BEST&#x27;s Wadala depot, is located here.

The Ackworth Leprosy Hospital was established during British rule, and part of its complex is now given to an AIDS awareness organisation as well. The world&#x27;s first methane generation plant was set up in the Ackworth hospital complex.

==History==

===Prehistoric===
Wadala village lay on one of the Seven Islands of Bombay that were joined to form the modern day Mumbai. The island was previously called by different names: Parel, Matunga, Dharavi or Sion.

===19th century===
The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme of 1899-1900 was the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay. The &quot;Bombay City Improvement Trust&quot; which was set after a bill was passed in the British parliament, formulated this plan in order to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics of the 1890s. According to the survey plan, 85,000 people were to be accommodated in the developments in Wadala.

The plans regulated constructions with emphasis on proper sanitation. Buildings were to be three storeys high, and were to have open spaces between them. The land-use was planned to be a mix of residential, commercial and institutional constructions. Parks and gardens were planned, and the streets were well laid out.

 of land was procured and leased to the Government for selling. For the first time housing cooperatives were formed to take advantage of newly developed land. The Parsi (Zoroastrian) and Hindu colonies in Dadar-Wadala were developed in this way.

===20th century===

In 1915 the Port Trust Railway opened the Wadala Ballard Pier railway line. Petrol and kerosene installations also came up in Wadala. The Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (formerly the Victoria Jubilee Technological Institute) moved to its present campus at Wadala in 1923. The Institute of Chemical Technology (formerly the University Department of Chemical Technology) was established in Wadala in 1934.

During the Civil Disobedience Movement, the Wadala Salt Works was raided by around 1,500 volunteers of the Congress party on 1 June 1930. The incident occurred after an appeal was made in the &quot;Congress Bulletin&quot; of 31 May, to challenge the &#x27;British anarchy&#x27;. The British government in India reacted quickly and 11 women were detained.

==Geography==
Wadala was once considered a central suburb of the city of Mumbai, but it is now well within the city limits. The area is bordered by Dadar on the West, Matunga on the Northwest and Sewri on the South. 

The north eastern areas of Wadala are covered by salt pans, which are on the shores of the Thane creek. On the Eastern border of Wadala, MMRDA has planned to construct a truck terminus, spread over . 

Mumbai will have for the first time a centralized facility for the transport of goods by road.

==Landmarks and architecture==

Wadala has a large number of old temples, university campuses and is also home to a former world&#x27;s largest IMAX dome theater. It is also home to the Vidyalankar Educational Campus, whose building design has won an international award viz. Designshare&#x27;s Honour award. The BEST Transport Museum is also located at Wadala&#x27;s Anik bus depot. 

It features amateur mini models of BEST buses and the ancient trams.

Wadala is also known for churches, temples and dargas. Near the station is the 400-year-old Vitthal Temple built by Sant Tukaram who brought the idol from Pandharpur, home of the original temple of Lord Vithal. The temple is known as &quot;Prati Pandharpur&quot; (Pandharpur temple&#x27;s replica). One of the many one-day festivals in Mumbai has been held in this temple to devote Lord Vitthal on &quot;Ashadhi Ekadashi&quot; (According to Hindu Calendar) in June/July. Near this temple is the 15th-century Lord Ram temple and the Hanuman temple on the opposite side of the road. The Ram Temple also houses a marriage hall. Located on David S. Baretto Road is a Krishna Temple which also houses an orphanage. Wadala also has a Balaji Temple, that celebrates the Jatra festival each year in the month of January. Apart from these, there is also a Shiv Temple, a Devi Mandir and a small Gurudwara near the station.

The St. Joseph Church (Our Lady of Dolours Church) is situated on the D. S. Barretto Road, between Five Gardens and Wadala station. This also houses the St. Joseph&#x27;s High School. Opposite is the Don Bosco Shelter which is a centre for the rehabilitation and education of underprivileged children. The Barkat Ali Dargah is located on a hill where the bridge connecting Wadala East to Wadala West ends. It is another of Wadala&#x27;s landmarks.

The St. Dominic Savio Church is located in Wadala East. This church, built in 1981, was the first of Mumbai churches to be situated on the first floor.

Wadala (East) houses two cemeteries, the Baháʼí Cemetery and the Chinese Cemetery. These cemeteries were laid out in Wadala a long time ago, for the same reason that the Ackworth Leprosy Home was built at Wadala viz. Wadala was considered a distant suburb of the city.

A number of housing colonies exist in Wadala. Some of them are Bhakti Park, Dosti Acres, Eucress and Lloyd&#x27;s Estate. Wadala East also has the BPT (now MbPT housing colony), a large sprawling colony for the port workers complete with a hospital. Near Antop Hill, the government of India established the Intellectual Property Office responsible for Controlling General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks in India.

About 2 kilometers from Wadala Station East, past the truck terminus, is Flamingo Bay. From 1994, lesser flamingos have been wintering here. From December to March, thousands of flamingos descend on the mudflats, a mile from the shore, to feed on the nutrient-rich marshes. The proposed Nhava Sheva bridge that will connect the island to the mainland has faced criticism from environmentalists, who allege that the habitat of these birds would be destroyed if the project is approved and completed.

Over the years, slum development had started in Wadala adjacent to the railway tracks and a large colony began to form. In 2006, the state government took action and cleared the area of slums.

==Utilities==
Wadala receives electricity supplied by the BEST undertaking. Wadala experiences very few electricity cuts in a year, if at all. There are a number of schools, colleges and hospitals. There are police stations in both Wadala West and East. The &quot;Voice of Wadala&quot; is the neighbourhood newsletter, in print since 1988. One of the concerns for residents of Wadala is that it does not have any malls or supermarkets. For shopping, one has to use local shops, or travel to Matunga or Dadar.

<text>Three figure skating events were contested at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, but they were held in April 1920, four months before most of the other Olympic events at the 1920 Games. The figure skating competition took place at the Ice Palace of Antwerp.

Gillis Grafström of Sweden captured the first of three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the men&#x27;s single event in 1920. Theresa Weld, who came in third place in the ladies&#x27; single event, was the first North American skater to win an Olympic medal. 1908 gold medalist Ulrich Salchow finished fourth. At age 44, bronze medalist Martin Stixrud is the oldest man to ever win an Olympic medal in an individual winter event.

Despite receiving no first place votes from the judges in the women&#x27;s singles, Magda Julin of Sweden captured the gold on the strength of three second-place ordinals. She was three months pregnant at the time.

Bronze medalist Phyllis Johnson from the UK had captured the silver medal at the 1908 Olympics with a different partner.

<text>A National Plant Collection is a registered and documented collection of a group of cultivated plants in the United Kingdom. National Plant Collections are part of a plant conservation scheme run by Plant Heritage, a registered charity which aims to protect and develop the biological and heritage resource of plants in UK gardens.

Participating individuals or organisations undertake to collect and conserve living material of a particular group of plants, as well as research its history and cultivation. Collection holders must be members of Plant Heritage, and agree to stringent requirements for labelling, documentation, and propagation of the collection. They may be individuals, botanic gardens, plant nurseries, local authority parks, or groups of people holding distributed collections.

Some collections are composed of a taxonomic group, such as a single genus or species. Others are defined by a horticultural group, such as cultivars with particular foliage characteristics or plants collected by a certain historical figure. There may be multiple collections covering the same plant group, which reduces the risk of rare plants being lost from extreme climatic events.

As of October 2023, there are over 700 collections comprising a total of over 95,000 plants.

<text>HMS &quot;Wolverine&quot; was an Admiralty modified W-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy. She was one of four destroyers ordered in April 1918 from James Samuel White &amp; Co Ltd under the 14th Order for Destroyers of the Emergency War Programme of 1917–18. She was the seventh Royal Navy Ship to carry the name. It had been introduced in 1798 for a gun brig and last borne by a destroyer sunk after a collision in 1917.

==Construction==
&quot;Wolverine&quot;″s keel was laid on 8 October 1918 at the James Samuel White &amp; Co. Ltd. Shipyard in Cowes, Isle of Wight. She was launched on 17 July 1919. She was overall in length with a beam of . Her mean draught was, and would reach under full load. She had a displacement of 1,140 tons standard and up to 1,550 full load.

She was propelled by three White-Foster type water-tube boilers powering Parsons geared steam turbines developing driving two screws for a maximum designed speed of . She was oil-fired and had a bunkerage of 320 to 370 tons. This gave a range of between at and at .

She shipped four BL 4.7 in (120 mm) Mk.I guns, mount P Mk.I naval guns in four single center-line turrets. The turrets were disposed as two forward and two aft in super imposed firing positions. She also carried two QF 2 pdr Mk.II &quot;pom-pom&quot; (40 mm L/39) mounted abeam between the funnels. Abaft of the second funnel she carried six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts on the centreline.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Wolverine&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 27 January 1920 with the pennant number D78. After commissioning she was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Atlantic Fleet. The Flotilla served in Home waters in the early 1920s. The Flotilla was first assigned to the Mediterranean then in 1926 reassigned to the China Station.

In early 1930s she underwent a refit and was placed in reserve as more modern destroyers came into service. &quot;Wolverine&quot; was laid-up in Maintenance Reserve at Rosyth with a special complement. She was reactivated, manned by Reservists, for a Royal Review at Weymouth in August 1939. With war looming, she was retained in service and brought to war readiness.

==Second World War==
In September 1939 &quot;Wolverine&quot; was allocated to the 15th Destroyer Flotilla at Rosyth for East Coast convoy defence. On 5 September she deployed with , and as escort for convoy GC1 from Milford Haven. She was based at Milford Haven and engaged in convoy escort duty in the English Channel and South-West Approaches. During this period she escorted 19 convoys, one of which was attacked.

In April 1940 she was transferred to the Home Fleet for the Norwegian campaign for convoy defence and support. On 14 May she deployed with to escort the Polish troopship as she delivered reinforcements and AA guns to Bodø. Under heavy and sustained air attack, &quot;Chrobry&quot; received three hits. &quot;Wolverine&quot; embarked nearly 700 soldiers from the burning troopship, including the Irish Guards, while &quot;Stork&quot; provided air defence. These troops were delivered to Harstad. At this time her pennant number was changed to I72 for visual signalling purposes.

In June she was involved in the evacuation of France, assisting in the evacuation of the Biscay ports, an action known as Operation Aerial.

In August 1940 &quot;Wolverine&quot; returned to convoy escort duty, joining the 6th Escort Group for escort duty in the North-West Approaches. In this role she was engaged in all the duties performed by escort ships; protecting convoys, searching for and attacking U-boats, and rescuing survivors. She operated in this role the next 21 months. She escorted 27 North Atlantic convoys, 10 of which were attacked, and was involved in two major battles there.

In March 1941 she was leader of the escort group for Convoy OB 293 which was attacked by a U-boat pack. The escorts were able to drive this attack off, destroying &quot;U-70&quot; in the process. She made an attack on a contact, an attack which was believed to have resulted in the destruction of ; this assessment was revised later, and &quot;Wolverine&quot; is believed to have hit , which escaped with damage. HMS Wolverine had made an earlier attack on a submarine at 0510hrs 7 March 1941, 5 minutes after &quot;U-47&quot;&#x27;s last known torpedo attack on the Whale Factory Ship, Terje Viken. Nothing further was heard from &quot;U-47&quot; after this time.

In April 1941 &quot;Wolverine&quot; deployed with and , the escort force for Convoy SC 26. Under sustained attacks by &quot;U-46&quot;, &quot;U-74&quot; and &quot;U-73&quot; six ships were sunk and several others were damaged. On 5 April, after sonar contact was made, &quot;Wolverine&quot; and &quot;Scarborough&quot; depth-charged to the surface. &quot;U-76&quot; sank by the stern after her crew was rescued.

In February 1942 &quot;Wolverine&quot; was converted to a short-range escort (SRE). To augment the earlier changes, the replacement of the after bank of torpedo tubes with a single QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun and the landing of &#x27;Y&#x27; gun for additional space for depth charge gear and stowage, the 2-pounder &quot;pompoms&quot; were replaced with two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons amidships and the &#x27;A&#x27; gun was replaced with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar. A Type 271 target indication radar was added on the bridge to augment the Type 286M air warning radar. In April she undertook training and practice under her new captain, Commander P W Gretton (promoted to Vice Admiral and knighted after the war).

In July she moved to Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean. In August &quot;Wolverine&quot; took part in Operation Pedestal. While escorting she detected a submarine on the surface. She carried out a ramming attack and sank submarine . She suffered major bow damage and her port turbine was disabled. She returned to Gibraltar under her own power for temporary repair, followed by several months in dock at Devonport. During her stay at Gibraltar she escorted six Gibraltar and six South Atlantic convoys, three of which were attacked.

After repairs completed in December she was employed in Western Approaches convoy defence duties. She served mainly on local escort assignments until her transfer to Freetown, South Africa in February 1943. She remained on station performing convoy escort duties until January when she returned to the UK for a refit. During this period she escorted 17 convoys, two of which were attacked.

In January 1944 &quot;Wolverine&quot; returned to Britain for a refit, before returning to escort duty with Western Approaches. In January 1945 she was engaged in anti-submarine patrols in the Channel and Southwest Approaches, where she continued to the end of the war in Europe. In May she was withdrawn from operational service, paid off into reserve pending a decision on disposal.

==Disposition==
&quot;Wolverine&quot; was placed on the disposal list after VJ-day and sold for scrapping on 28 January 1946 to West of Scotland Shipbreakers. She was towed to the breaker&#x27;s yard at Troon in September 1946.

<doc id="946423" wikidata="Q844556" url="?curid=946423" title="Anzac Memorial">
<text>The Anzac Memorial is a heritage-listed war memorial, museum and monument located in Hyde Park South near Liverpool Street in the CBD of Sydney, Australia.
The Art Deco monument was designed by C. Bruce Dellit, with the exterior adorned with monumental figural reliefs and sculptures by Rayner Hoff, and built from 1932 to 1934 by Kell &amp; Rigby. This state-owned property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 April 2010.

The memorial is the focus of commemoration ceremonies on Anzac Day, Remembrance Day and other important occasions. It was built as a memorial to the Australian Imperial Force of World War I. Fund raising for a memorial began on 25 April 1916, the first anniversary of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landing at Anzac Cove for the Battle of Gallipoli. It was opened on 24 November 1934 by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. In 2018, refurbishments and a major expansion were completed. The memorial was officially reopened by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.

== History ==
===Aboriginal land===
Material in rock shelters reveals that Aboriginal people inhabited the Sydney Harbour area from at least 25,000 years ago. The Gadigal, who formed part of the Darug nation, were the Aboriginal traditional owners of the inner Sydney area, upon which the Anzac Memorial stands. It is believed that the southern end of Hyde Park, where the ANZAC Memorial is located, was used as a &quot;contest ground&quot; for staging combative trials between Aboriginal warriors, watched avidly by the British in the early days of the colony. It is remarkable that the State&#x27;s most grand and monumental war memorial should be positioned on this historical site of indigenous combat.

===Origins of the term &quot;Anzac&quot;===
The term &quot;Anzac&quot; began as an acronym for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in World War I, but it was soon accepted as a word in its own right. The Anzacs formed part of the expeditionary force organised by Britain and France to invade the Gallipoli Peninsula and clear the Dardanelles Straits for the British Navy. The Australian Anzacs represented the national effort from a young nation taking its part in the Great War and reports of the courage they displayed at Gallipoli became the most enduring legend of Australian military history (Government Architect&#x27;s CMP, 2007).

After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the Anzac infantry divisions went on to fight against Germany on the Western Front. The Light Horse fought to protect the Suez Canal against the Turks and joined the forces fighting in the Middle East. On the anniversary of Anzac Day in 1918, the Australian infantry reinforced the legend when it stopped the German advance at Villers-Bretonneux on the Somme. Australians were successfully used as shock troops at Ypres, Amiens, Mont St Quentin and Peronne, and took a leading part in breaking through the Hindenburg Line, in their last major offensive.

From an Australian population of around four and a half million, enlistments in the army and navy numbered 416,809, a total that represents one-half of the men of military age in Australia at that time. Altogether, 60,000 Australians were killed and 167,000 were injured, a higher toll proportionately than was suffered by any other British Empire country. Small wonder that those who returned wanted to see the sacrifice of their dead comrades remembered.

The first Anzac Day in NSW was organised by a committee within the Returned Soldiers Association (RSA) of NSW, an organisation formed by men who had been invalided home. Later the organisation was subsumed by the Returned Soldiers&#x27; Sailors&#x27; (and Airmen&#x27;s) Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA), finally named the Returned and Services League (RSL). The original objectives of the day of commemoration were to remember dead comrades, induce young men to enlist and collect money for an ANZAC Memorial monument. NSW Premier WA Holman&#x27;s Labor government promised a pound for pound subsidy to match the money raised on the first Anzac Day. In 1917 the RSSILA requested that 25 April be declared &#x27;Australia&#x27;s National Day&#x27; and gazetted as a public holiday. Both the Queensland and Australian governments made Anzac Day a public holiday in 1921. The official public holiday was first gazetted in NSW in 1925.

===Developing the memorial concept in Australia===
Historian Ken Inglis believes that the &quot;war memorial&quot; is a twentieth century concept which memorialised the human cost of war rather than the victorious outcome, as the former military monuments had done, and celebrated the sacrifice of ordinary soldiers rather than focusing on the men who led them. The names of those who made the ultimate sacrifice are differentiated from the names of those who returned. Whether returned or not, the memorials record the soldiers&#x27; service to the nation. This trend to list both the returned and the fallen was uniquely Australian, reflecting the all volunteer nature of the Australian forces.

Each capital city developed its own major memorial, with many smaller memorials in the suburbs, and regional areas. The major memorials and their dates of construction are as follows:

*Darwin Cenotaph, Darwin – 1921
*War Memorial, Hobart − 1925
*State War Memorial Cenotaph, Perth – 1928–1929
*Shrine of Remembrance, Brisbane – 1930
*National War Memorial, Adelaide – 1931
*Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne – 1928–1934
*ANZAC Memorial, Sydney – 1934
*Australian War Memorial, Canberra – 1941

The earlier memorials are generally in the form of obelisks, sometimes with applied sculpture, while most of the later examples are commemorative buildings with a range of rooms and uses. The social meanings of war memorials increased in complexity as time went on. The later examples such as the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, 1934, the ANZAC Memorial in Sydney, 1934 and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, 1941, represented the new trends in the symbolism of memorials more than the simple columns, obelisks and statues of citizen soldiers erected during the fighting and immediately after it. The Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne is the most comparable monument to the ANZAC Memorial in Australia, both comprising one principal commemorative space, surrounded and above a series of administrative and exhibition spaces, contained within an imposing landmark building in differing architectural styles, set within a formal landscape.

===Authorising the ANZAC Memorial===
In 1918 the RSSILA in 1918 published its aims for the monument:
# The building was to be a memorial for those who died;
# It was to be architecturally worthy of its high purpose;
# It was to provide headquarters for those working to assist widows and children of those who were killed and also, those AIF members who returned;
# It was to house the records of the AIF;
# It would be a meeting place and a source of assistance with repatriation; and
# It would provide a centre for any later campaigns on behalf of the AIF and their dependants.

After 1919, all the state&#x27;s war memorial building committees were required to seek expert advice from a War Memorials Advisory Committee comprising representatives from the Town Planning Association, Institute of Architects (NSW), Royal Society of Artists and the National Art Gallery (NSW). A proposal to build the memorial on Observatory Hill was withdrawn due to the planned proximity of the roads leading onto the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The proposal to use part of Hyde Park for the Anzac Memorial was promoted by former city surveyor Norman Weekes who was redesigning Hyde Park after it had been virtually destroyed during the construction of the city railway. Assisted by architect Raymond McGrath, Weekes produced a plan with two axial avenues running north -south and east–west, the latter being in line with the transept of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. He envisaged the intersection of these avenues as an ideal site for a commemorative column and balanced that with an Anzac Memorial at the southern end. However, progress on the memorial was impeded until legislation established a board of trustees for the building and the manner in which the site would be chosen was passed in 1923.

The Trustees gained Parliamentary approval for Weekes&#x27; plan in 1929 on the condition that the area dedicated to the memorial would be limited in size. The Advisory Board for the Hyde Park Remodelling chose the southern end of the park to site the monument. The National Council of Women and Anzac Fellowship of Women objected to this site because it was considered to be insufficiently commanding, while artist Julian Ashton pointed out that skyscrapers would soon overshadow its position.

About this time another war memorial was bequeathed to Australians by the late JF Archibald, co-founder of the Bulletin newspaper, to commemorate the association of Australia and France in the Great War of 1914–1918. Created by Francois Sicard, winner of the Prix de Rome in 1891, the Public Trustee requested that it be installed at the site of Weekes&#x27; proposed column at the northern end of Hyde Park. Major Hubert Colette and JB Waterhouse supervised the erection of the Archibald Memorial Fountain, which was completed on 14 March 1932. This was when work was beginning on the ANZAC Memorial building at the southern end of the same avenue.

Debates about the style of the ANZAC Memorial can be generally divided into soldiers&#x27; versus women&#x27;s groups which supported utility versus beauty respectively. The majority of returned soldiers looked for a building that would meet their immediate needs for association, while women&#x27;s groups tended to favour a structure that would be commemorative. After ten years of debate, the RSSILA and the disabled veterans bodies all agreed on Anzac Day 1928 that the building &quot;should be commemorative rather than utilitarian&quot;. As the RSSILA state president Fred Davison expressed it, the League had finally agreed to a &quot;shrine of remembrance&quot; such as their Victorian counterparts had begun to build. The soldiers&#x27; needs were not entirely abandoned and in the spirit of compromise one-seventh of the funding was allocated to incorporate offices where the returned soldiers&#x27; organisations could look after their members.

===The Cenotaph, Martin Place===

The uncertainty about both site and building style of the ANZAC Memorial combined with the long wait for its construction left Sydney without a focal point for Anzac Day ceremonies. Around 1925 the Lang Labor government responded to the urging of the NSW RSSILA by donating 10,000 pounds for a cenotaph in Martin Place, near where wartime appeals and recruitment rallies had been held. This was also the place where the Armistice Day crowds had honoured their &quot;Glorious Dead&quot; at the war&#x27;s end on 11 November 1918. It was consecrated on 8 August 1927, becoming the focus of Anzac Day ceremonies some eight years before the ANZAC Memorial building was available for such purposes. Sydney&#x27;s Anzac Day Dawn Service was never moved to the ANZAC Memorial because the Cenotaph had already become the accepted site and Martin Place had stronger war-time associations than Hyde Park.

===The ANZAC Memorial design competition===
A competition for the design of the memorial was commissioned on 13 July 1929. Entrants were required to be Australians qualified to work as architects within or outside NSW, the latter persons being required to register in the state if they won. Competitors could confer with an Australian sculptor, either while designing the competition entry or during its construction. All entrants had to register by 30 January 1930 and present their entries two weeks later. The judges were Professor A. S. Hook, Dean of the Sydney University Faculty of Architecture Professor Leslie Wilkinson, and the Public Trustee E. J. Payne. The winner would be appointed the ANZAC Memorial architect. The cost of the building was limited to calculated at rates current at the time of entry. In addition to the memorial itself the building was required to provide office accommodation for the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League, TB Soldiers&#x27; Association and the Limbless Soldiers&#x27; Association. The trustees received 117 entries in the competition and chose seven for second stage consideration which were exhibited in the Blaxland Galleries in Farmers Department Store (now Grace Bros). In February 1930 the prize-winning entries were announced by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game. Third prize was awarded to Peter Kaad, second prize to John D. Moore and the winner was Bruce Dellit. The successful contractors for the building works were Kell &amp; Rigby. According to &quot;Building&quot; magazine, most people agreed that Dellit&#x27;s design for the ANZAC Memorial was the best in the competition.

In his entry, Dellit submitted a model with photographs of it from all angles and 17 drawing sheets including an aerial perspective and an isometric section in Dellit&#x27;s own words: &quot;ENDURANCE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE – these are the three thoughts which have inspired the accompanying design, and it is around the last mentioned that it develops&quot;. Dellit explained that the central sculpture &quot;sacrifice&quot; was placed in the lower chamber &quot;like a famous French tomb&quot; – Napoleon&#x27;s tomb – to &quot;offer visitors an opportunity for a quiet, dignified, physical and mental acknowledgment of the message&quot;.

====Bruce Dellit, the architect====
Australian-born Charles Bruce Dellit studied at Sydney Technical College under Byera Hadley from 1912 to 1918 and continued his professional education at the University of Sydney. Dellit registered as an architect in June 1923 and established his own practice six years later. Before winning the ANZAC Memorial competition, he had designed Kyle House in Macquarie Place featuring the &quot;monumental entrance arch&quot; that became one of his characteristic motifs. It also shows his interest in American Art Deco skyscrapers and the patterned brickwork espoused by contemporary Dutch and German schools. Along with his contemporary Emil Sodersten, he is considered to have pioneered the Art Deco style in Australia. Dellit employed a more pronounced use of ornament and symbolism while Sodersten relied more on form and materials for his architecture. Many of the notable Art Deco buildings in Sydney were designed by these architects.

In designing the ANZAC Memorial, Dellit used sculptural and architectural imagery to express collective mourning at the death of so many young men from NSW. The form of the sculpture changed with the involvement of Rayner Hoff, whom Dellit engaged after he had won the competition. Hoff greatly strengthened the imagery by replacing Dellit&#x27;s seasons and sculptures representing the arts of war and peace with figures representing all branches of the armed services. The Pool of Reflection that mirrors the building on the northern side remains Dellit&#x27;s call for passers-by to stop and remember.

Similarly, while the central sculpture &quot;Sacrifice&quot; at the heart of the building is Hoff&#x27;s, the form of the interior, itself very emotive, is Dellit&#x27;s. Dellit used impressive staircases flanked by memorial urns to lead the visitor up into the Hall of Memory. Once there, they must bow their heads to look into the Well of Contemplation in order to contemplate &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, which is in the Hall of Silence below or look up to see the dome decorated with 120,000 golden &quot;Stars of Memory&quot;, each representing a serviceman or woman from NSW. Dellit&#x27;s architecture and Hoff&#x27;s sculptures greatly enhance each other to provide an artistically integrated emotional message.

According to Maisy Stapleton, the greatest exponents of the Art Deco style in Sydney were the architects C. Bruce Dellit and Emil Sodersten. She considered that Dellit&#x27;s highest achievement was the ANZAC Memorial, &quot;a vision of modern form and strong, emotive expression closely allied to popular sentiment&quot; and described the memorial as &quot;the epitome of Art Deco in Australia&quot;.

Dellit died of cancer on 21 August 1942 only eight years after the ANZAC Memorial was ceremoniously opened. It is considered his finest achievement by some, &quot;a vision of modern form and strong, emotive expression closely allied to popular sentiment.&quot; His later works included two chapels at Kinsela&#x27;s Funeral Parlour, Darlinghurst, 1933 and several bank buildings in the city as well as numerous competition entries. The Bulletin obituary described him as an &quot;arresting and vital figure Everything about him was big&quot;.

====Rayner Hoff, the sculptor====

George Rayner Hoff was born in 1894 on the Isle of Man. His father later moved the family to Nottingham in England where Rayner Hoff worked in a stonemason&#x27;s yard while still at school. At 14 he commenced work in an architect&#x27;s office and later furthered his training by studying drawing and design at the Nottingham School of Art. In 1915 Hoff enlisted in the army and served on the Western Front the following year. After the war he studied sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London under Frances Derwent Wood and in 1922 he won the Prix de Rome.

Hoff arrived in Sydney in August 1923 and began work as head teacher of modelling and sculpture at East Sydney Technical College, Darlinghurst (Sydney&#x27;s major art school), where he also established his private studio. Hoff exerted an enormous influence on the progress of Australian sculpture. By the end of the decade, Hoff&#x27;s work at the college produced a school of gifted sculptors and assistants. It was, according to Deborah Edwards, &quot;perhaps the sole instance of a coherent school of production among sculptors in Australian history&quot;. In 1925 Hoff completed reliefs for the Dubbo War Memorial and in 1927 he was commissioned to design the sculptures on the National War Memorial, South Australia.

In 1930 Dellit commissioned Hoff to design the sculptures for the ANZAC Memorial. Creating the numerous sculptures on the ANZAC Memorial became the pinnacle of Hoff &#x27;s career. The task involved creation of sixteen seated and four standing figures of servicemen and women in cast synthetic stone, four corner cast stone reliefs and two long bronze bas-reliefs over the eastern and western doors outside the building. Hoff&#x27;s contributions to the interior also included designing the form of the 120,000 faceted gold stars that covered the domed ceiling, four relief panels showing the march of the dead, each superimposed with symbolic representations of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Army Medical Corps, and the marble wreath surrounding the Well of Contemplation that framed the view of Sacrifice below. Hoff and eight assistants were fully employed on the memorial between 1931 and 1934.

Hoff gave considerable prominence to the female contributors to the war effort in the ANZAC Memorial, including the women who lost their fathers, husbands and sons. Nurses were prominent among the figures representing the services and women were central to the group sculpture, &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. Hoff explained the prominent position of the women in this work in 1932: &quot;Thousands of women, although not directly engaged in war activities lost all that was dearest to them. There was no acknowledgment of them in casualty lists, lists of wounded, maimed and killed. In this spirit I have shown them carrying their load, the sacrifice of their menfolk&quot;.

In 1932 models for the two massive bronze groups intended for placement in front of the east and west windows were publicly exhibited. Hoff&#x27;s &quot;The Crucifixion of Civilisation 1914&quot; and &quot;Victory after Sacrifice 1918&quot; both featured naked women as the central figures. The violent controversy that greeted the exhibition of these models prevented their development into full-size sculptures, with the sexual aspect of the imagery attracting the most intense criticism. In despair over the controversy, Hoff eventually destroyed the plaster models and refused to compromise his designs when the possibility of making them was raised again in 1934. The sculptures were never completed.

Hoff&#x27;s other public sculptures in Sydney included a bas-relief of Mercury in Transport House, York Street and several sculptures in Emil Sodersten&#x27;s City Mutual Life Building in Hunter Street. However, in spite of his obvious success, Hoff was unable to shake the controversy about the unexecuted ANZAC Memorial sculptures. It remained with him until his early death from pancreatitis on 19 November 1937.

===Builders and contractors===
The trustees specified that the memorial must be built of Australian materials and by Australian workmen. Having been encouraged to give preference to returned servicemen, the contractors Kell &amp; Rigby applied to the RSSILA Labour Bureau for their workers. Also working on the ANZAC Memorial were numerous sub-contractors. These professionals and artisans included structural engineers RS Morris &amp; Co Ltd, masons Melocco Bros Ltd who carved the wreath around the Well of Contemplation, Messrs Loveridge and Hudson Ltd who prepared the granite facing on the outside walls, JC Goodwin and Co Ltd who supplied the amber glass, Art Glass Ltd, which completed the sandblasting, and T. Grounds and Sons who manufactured the stone figures on the buttresses and the funerary urns to Hoff&#x27;s design. The London firm of Morris Singer &amp; Co Ltd cast central sculpture and bronze panels over the doors but the flame surrounding the sculpture and the bronze grilles on the lower windows were made in Australia by Castle Bros, while Kell &amp; Rigby themselves produced the bronze nails studding the doors. Homebush Ceiling Works made the ceilings and supplied the 120,000 stars for the dome, the latter being gilded by A. Zimmerman. Kellor and Yates completed the plasterwork. The Electrical and General Installation Co was responsible for the electrical installation and Nielsen and Moller made the light fixtures. Later, Dellit was able to persuade the City Council to supply temporary floodlighting for the building, a service made permanent in 1938.

===Changes in the course of constructing the ANZAC Memorial===
Originally, Dellit wanted the memorial to be built of sandstone or synthetic granite on an 18-inch base of Bowral trachyte. However, the building was actually constructed in red granite from quarries near Bathurst, NSW. The podium and semi-circular stairs were faced in granite; and the terrace was formed in terrazzo.

In 1932 Dellit incorporated four stones from battlefields at Gallipoli, France, Palestine and New Guinea into the floors of the niches in the Hall of Memory in the form of the AIF Rising Sun. The names of major battles at each of these sites were added to the niche walls. The dome of stars approved in 1933 was also a late inclusion. This feature began as a fundraiser when the project had lost support through the fracas over Hoff&#x27;s exterior statues. To cover the shortfall in funding the memorial, the RSSILA offered 150,000 stars for sale at two shillings each. Although they were unable to sell the full number, 120,000 stars were fixed to the ceiling to represent all the state&#x27;s volunteers. In order to facilitate their attachment to the plaster ceiling, they were fashioned from plaster of Paris and gilded.

In another late change, the interior walls were lined in unpolished marble while polished marble covered the floors. All doors were originally to be bronze but funding shortages caused that specification to be changed to maple, studded with bronze nails. Dellit intended that each of the great amber windows would bear a different design for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Medical Corps. However, the building subcommittee asked for an alternative and a new design was etched on all the windows which combined the AIF symbol with a pattern of eternal flames.

Dellit always intended that the office accommodation at the base of the building should be incorporated into the memorial when the need for its original use had passed. The ex-servicemen&#x27;s offices featured joinery in silky oak and parquetry floors of red mahogany. Light fittings in the shape of stars echoed the dome in the Hall of Memories. On the eastern side Dellit added an Assembly Hall to balance the entry foyer on the west. This room had seating for 130 people and was available to all ex-servicemen&#x27;s groups. In practice it was used mainly by the associations with offices in the building. Its small size and the ban on alcohol (which applied to the whole memorial) meant that few associations sought to hire it. It was not available for outside use from 1942 to 1957 while the RSL occupied it as an extension to their office.

The inscriptions that Dellit intended for the memorial were another casualty of the design process. The trustees consulted the poet Leon Gellert, then Professor Hook, who consulted Professor Mungo McCallum, librarian H. M. Green and historian C. E. W. Bean, about the inscriptions. These experts ruled against most of the numerous labels suggested by Dellit. The surviving inscriptions include those on the foundation stones laid by Governor Game and Premier Bevan on 19 July 1932 which bear the words &quot;A soldier set this stone&quot; and &quot;A citizen set this stone&quot; to indicate the contributions both soldiers and citizens had made to the building. An inscription in the floor at the western entrance to the Hall of Silence, &quot;Let Silent Contemplation be Your Offering&quot; was also kept, as was a list of the major battles in the Hall of Silence. The experts chose a simple statement submitted by Hook, Green and Bean to mark the dedication of the building, stating, &quot;This Memorial was opened by a son of the King on 24th November 1934&quot;.

Another feature that was considerably altered was the landscaping. Dellit planned water gardens for either side of the memorial in the form of a narrow pool to the north and a cascading waterfall to the south. However, as the bulk of the building began to rise above the park, it became apparent that the scale of the water features needed to be increased to balance it. As a result, the cascades were eliminated and the pool extended to 170 feet (52 metres) long by 72 feet (22 metres) wide. Landscaping was completed by the City Council, which was responsible for the park. Finance for the additional work came from the state Unemployment Relief Fund and a large number of council employees and relief labourers poured the concrete for the pool in a single day to eliminate the need for joints and ensure that it was watertight. The Council acceded to Dellit&#x27;s request to keep a clear open space around the memorial. It also followed his plan for a line of poplars on either side of the pool to symbolise the French battlefields. Dellit also wanted beds filled with the red poppies of Flanders and other plantings from the eastern and western fronts.

===The Opening Ceremony, 24 November 1934===

Crowds attending the opening of the ANZAC Memorial were estimated at 100,000. Archbishop Sheehan boycotted the event on the grounds that it was &quot;not entirely Catholic in character&quot;. In keeping with the words on the foundation tablets, the ceremony aimed to show that the building was of and for the people. The Duke of Gloucester made the dedication speech and the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney Dr Howard Mowll gave the prayer:
&#x27;To the Glory of God, and as a lasting monument of all the members of the Australian Forces of the State of NSW, who served their King and country in the Great War, and especially in grateful remembrance of those who laid down their lives, we dedicate this ANZAC Memorial&#x27;.

To familiarise the public with the symbolism of the monument and to mark its completion, in 1934 the Trustees published The Book of the Anzac Memorial in a limited edition. This volume both commemorated and explained the memorial. The December 1934 issue of Building magazine also focused on the ANZAC Memorial, devoted nine pages to explain its details and symbolism.

===Offices at the memorial===

All associations with offices in the ANZAC Memorial building helped members with their applications to the Repatriation Department and assistance with medical needs. Each office in the memorial had a counter where members could apply for assistance, a waiting lobby, and secretarial and general offices.

By the mid 1930s the ex-servicemen&#x27;s offices in the ANZAC Memorial were already overcrowded, and the situation became critical when veterans from World War II began accessing the building for services in the 1940s. The RSL gained permission to extend its rooms into the Assembly Hall in 1942 but its situation was not significantly improved until it moved to nearby Anzac House in College Street in 1957. The TB Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen also moved into Anzac House but returned to the ANZAC Memorial in 1980. The Limbless and Maimed Soldiers&#x27; Association stayed in the memorial through the whole period that its members survived.

===Changing perceptions of the ANZAC Memorial===
Australia was embroiled in World War II less than five years after the ANZAC Memorial opened. Attempts to physically make changes and add additional symbols to reflect this and later wars did not proceed due to difficulties envisaging how this might be achieved without compromising the design.

Although the ANZAC Memorial experienced no significant structural changes, in the latter half of the twentieth century people did tend to assume that it was a memorial for all wars. The memorial also became a symbol of all wars in a negative way, particularly in the case of the Australian Government&#x27;s support of the United States in Vietnam, which polarised the nation. In the prolonged civil protests about Australian involvement in that war – characterised by the moratorium marches of the late 1960s – the ANZAC Memorial became a rallying point. It was also the site of an anti-war sit-in in 1970 and the centre for a Ban the Bomb protest in 1983. In 1975 feminists inferred it was a symbol of male domination when they painted on it, &quot;Women march for Liberation&quot;.

In 1984 an amendment of the Anzac Memorial Building Act of 1923 legally acknowledged the meaning of the ANZAC Memorial that most people had already accepted when it authorised the building&#x27;s re-dedication as the principal war memorial of NSW. Governor Sir James Rowland performed the ceremony on 30 November, fifty years and six days after the first dedication by the Duke of Gloucester. From that time, the ANZAC Memorial&#x27;s stated purpose was to honour the men and women of NSW who served in all wars where Australia had been involved.

In the same year a &quot;museum&quot; or exhibition space was established to inform the public both about the wars in which Australia has been involved and those who served in them. It was originally opened on the 50th Anniversary of the official opening of the memorial, on 18 November 1984. A bronze plaque marking the event was mounted on a wall in the Vestibule. A permanent photographic exhibition titled &quot;Australians at War&quot; opened during this month and became a great success with visiting school groups and tourists.

A recent mark of respect to NSW service men and women was the 1995 addition of a Remembrance Flame to the Hall of Memory. The trustees made space for this new symbol by removing the door to the Archives Room and commissioning the Australian Gas Light Company Limited (AGL) to install the burner which is currently lit 8 hours a day between 9 am and 5 pm.

The ANZAC Memorial has been variously described as &quot;a unique statement of architectural and sculptural unity&quot;, &quot;the ultimate conception of the Art Deco style in this country&quot; and &quot;the epitome of Art Deco in Australia.&quot; It has become a site of increasing visitation in the 21st century, including a marked increase in the number of schools and other educational bodies. The ANZAC Memorial Building is &quot;a lasting memorial&quot;, [an] &quot;outstanding legacy&quot; that continues to move present-day Australians to bow their heads &#x27;in honoured memory of all those who have fought on the nation&#x27;s behalf&#x27;.

===Centenary Extension===

On 22 August 2016, work commenced on the $40 million enhancement of the Anzac Memorial. The extension was the “centrepiece of the State&#x27;s Centenary of Anzac commemorations, marking the 100th anniversary of the ending of the First World War”.

The major extension realised architect Bruce Dellit&#x27;s original concept for the Memorial and added new underground exhibition and education spaces. Premier Mike Baird said &quot;by enhancing this memorial we are ensuring future generations can continue to honour those who fought for the freedoms we enjoy today&quot;. Construction was completed by Built and jointly funded by the NSW and Australian Governments.

The upgrades included:

* A large water cascade feature on the southern side of the memorial, with new entrance and walkway. 
* The Hall of Service: including “a major artwork by Fiona Hall featuring 1,701 soil samples from each NSW town, suburb and district given as the home address by First World War enlistees”. 
* The Oculus, which is centred above the Hall of Service with a view out to the Memorial exterior.

The extension was designed by architects Johnson Pilton Walker and officially opened on 20 October 2018.

In June 2020 the Centenary Extension was awarded the Sir John Sulman Medal, the highest award for public architecture in New South Wales. Later that year in November 2020 the project was also awarded the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture by the Australian Institute of Architects at the national awards.

== Description ==

The building is constructed of concrete, with an exterior cladding of pink granite, and consists of a massed square superstructure with typically Art Deco setbacks and buttresses, punctuated on each side by a large arched window of yellow stained glass, and crowned with a ziggurat-inspired stepped roof. It is positioned atop a cruciform pedestal within which are located administrative offices and a small museum. The interior is largely faced in white marble, and features a domed ceiling adorned with 120,000 gold stars – one for each of those men and women from New South Wales who served during World War I. Access to the main hall is provided via broad stairways on each side of the building&#x27;s north–south axis, while ground-level doorways on the east and west sides offer entry to the lower section. The main focus of the interior is Rayner Hoff&#x27;s monumental bronze sculpture of a deceased youth, representing a soldier, held aloft on his shield by a caryatid – three female figures, representing his mother, sister and wife. The male figure&#x27;s nudity was considered shocking at the time of the monument&#x27;s opening, and it is said to be the only such representation of a naked male form within any war memorial. Two other even more controversial figural sculptures designed by Hoff—one featuring a naked female figure—were never installed on the eastern and western faces of the structure as intended, partly as a result of opposition from high ranking representatives of the Catholic Church. The building&#x27;s exterior is adorned with several bronze friezes, carved granite relief panels and twenty monumental stone figural sculptures symbolising military personnel, also by Hoff. Immediately to the north of the ANZAC Memorial is a large rectangular &quot;Lake of Reflections&quot; flanked by rows of poplars. The poplars, not native to Australia, symbolise the areas of France in which Australian troops fought. Original plans called for the construction of similar pools on each of the other sides of the building, but these were never built.

;The memorial setting

The ANZAC Memorial is located in Hyde Park South and is a principal physical focal point in the axis joining it and the Pool of Reflection with the Archibald Fountain in Hyde Park north. There are many prominent views of the memorial through Hyde Park South and the main axis is aligned with an avenue of fig trees, which accentuates the main path. The ziggurat form of ANZAC Memorial is also evident from Oxford Street for several blocks east of Whitlam Square.

The plantings around the ANZAC Memorial have strong associations with the building. The Allepo pine trees arranged around the building have significance because of their symbolic connection to Lone Pine Ridge in Anzac Cove in Turkey. Other symbolic trees have been brought as seedlings and planted in Hyde Park near the memorial, including Gallipoli Rose. The 14 poplars planted in two rows on either side of the Pool of Remembrance were planted in 1934, the date the pool was completed.

The pool underwent renovations in 1992 when a waterproof membrane was installed. This work was co-ordinated with paving around the memorial and the installation of a waterproofing membrane to the steps and podium level of the building.

Aligned between the Pool of Reflection and the memorial building staircase are two rows of flag poles that are used on ANZAC Day and commemorative occasions as part of the formal ceremonies at the memorial. Flags are flown permanently throughout the year. The three on the eastern side display the NSW flag and the three on the western side display the Australian national flag. The flagpole on the podium level of the memorial building is for the Governor&#x27;s Flag and is only used when the Governor formally visits the site.

;The external building
The ANZAC Memorial was designed as a sculptural monument. The building is symmetrical on both axes. It uses elements reminiscent of traditional gothic church buildings (buttresses, tall windows, high ceilings), but interprets them in an Art Deco style. Grand staircases lead to the podium level and extend symmetrically on the north and south sides of the building on the main axis of Hyde Park. The balustrade around the exterior of the podium level is surmounted with cast stone urns. Large timber moulded doors slide into cavities in the external walls to allow entry. The ground floor provides the visual base of the building form and is fenestrated with timber framed double hung windows and bronze security grilles. A string course of granite extends around the building and becomes the sill at windows.

The memorial is adorned externally with many sculptures representing the various Australian armed forces and support units. They are the sentinels of the building, keeping watch whilst representing the fallen for whom the building is dedicated. Between the seated figures in each corner are cast stone bas reliefs. The four large standing figures at the top of each corner of the building represent the Australian Infantry, Navy, Air Force and Army Medical Corps. Another 16 seated figures are positioned at the top of the buttresses, below the corner figures, and represent the various units. These statues include a Naval Signaller, Aviator, Nurse and Lewis Gunner fabricated from cast stone to resemble the granite facing of the building &quot;so they should have the effect of having been hewn out of the moment rather than placed thereon&quot;. Above the Eastern and Western Entrances, bronze bas reliefs depict scenes of Australians in the Eastern and Western Fronts. The bronze bas reliefs are generally in good condition, however they require cleaning and the repair of some minor corrosion.

A dark pink granosite (synthetic coating) applied to the external statues in the mid 1980s does not reinterpret the architect&#x27;s original design intention of the statues being hewn from the stone.

;The internal building
The memorial&#x27;s main entrance from ground level is from the Western side. The vestibule area is lined in Ulum white marble. Two timber cabinets of silky oak with obscured glass are recessed into opposite walls. In the centre of the ceiling is a large brass &quot;Star&quot; light, designed by Dellit.

This vestibule has glazed doors leading to the association and management offices to the north, exhibition area to the south, and opens to the west to the stair hall and the Hall of Silence. Originally, internal access between the upper and lower levels of the building was via two &quot;mirror imaged&quot; stairwells, which extended from the Stair Hall in the Vestibule to the Hall of Memory and down to the basement. One of these stairwells has been converted into a new lift, constructed in 2009, linking all three levels. This controlled lift was installed to provide equitable access to the Hall of Memory for ageing veterans and people with a disability. In the remaining stairwell is a bronze, Art Deco-styled skylight with amber glass. That has been converted to a light. Both stairwells are lined in marble with marble treads. A bronze handrail was fixed to each of the stair walls in 1997, designed by Louis Berczi, in a style to match the external copper handrails designed by Dellit.

At the edge of the Stair Hall is a barred entrance to the Hall of Silence. A large bronze moulded banister, too heavy to move, prevents access to the &quot;tomb&quot; of the fallen soldier, in the &quot;Hall of Silence&quot;. At the foot of the entrance, engraved in black granite, with inset brass lettering are the words &quot;LET SILENT CONTEMPLATION BE YOUR OFFERING&quot;.

At the top of the stairwell is a plaster niche framed with marble. The niche displays the original wreath laid by the trustees at the building opening. The wreath is kept in a glass display case and was restored in late 2009.

;Hall of Silence

The room located in the centre of the building is striking in its starkness and wields a powerful influence on visitors. The room is circular in plan with the sculpture &quot;Sacrifice&quot; located at its centre, as if to hold the sculpture in its embrace. The floor is Ulum white marble, inlayed with a bronze flame that flares out from the centrally located sculpture. The ceiling of the room curves up toward the carved marble banister that defines the &quot;Well of Contemplation&quot;, a large circular opening in the centre of the shallow domed ceiling. This opening provides the only natural lighting to the &quot;Hall of Silence&quot; and has the effect of focussing that light onto the central sculpture. The cornice is a marble frieze in which is carved the names of the great battles where Australian forces participated in the war. According to Dellit, the names &#x27;complete the message which the group of sculpture symbolising &quot;Sacrifice&quot; is intended to deliver&#x27;.

Located on the north–south and east–west axes, the room has three large silky oak double doors, gold painted, that slide open into wall cavities. Two of the doors are now permanently left open and glass doors installed in front of the reveals to allow visitors a view of the sculpture &quot;Sacrifice&quot; from inside the Exhibition space and the Assembly Hall.

;Sacrifice

At the heart of the memorial is the bronze sculpture, &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, by Rayner Hoff. It powerfully symbolises the sacrifice made in times of war by both those who go to fight and those left behind. The sculpture can be seen from above through the Well of Contemplation, with heads bowed, or at ground level from the vestibule, Assembly Hall and Exhibition space. The sculpture is also visible from Hyde Park, as originally proposed by Dellit, with glazed eastern doors to the Assembly Hall.

;Hall of Memory

The &quot;Hall of Memory&quot; is also a circular room that occupies the podium level of the building centred on and located directly above the &quot;Hall of Silence&quot;. The large external staircases that lead to the external timber sliding double doors on the podium level on the northern and southern sides were intended to form the grand entrances to the memorial. The &quot;Hall of Memory&quot; is clad in Ulum marble. In the centre of the room, carved in the form of a wreath is the marble balustrade around the &quot;Well of Contemplation&quot;.

Located in the four &quot;corners&quot; of the room are semi-circular &quot;Niches of Remembrance&quot;, each devoted to one of the major theatres of World War I in which Australians fought, and each commemorating the names of major campaigns in those theatres. The name of the theatre is carved in relief into the face of the marble wall at the top of each niche with the names of the battles beneath it, another example of the fusion of sculpture and building. At the base of each niche, laid in the paving is a headstone from Flanders, Gallipoli, Palestine and New Guinea.

Above the tall niches are marble cast bas reliefs by Rayner Hoff that represent the Army, Navy, Air Force and Army Medical Corps and therefore correspond to the four large standing external sculptures. Hoff called them &quot;The March of the Dead&quot;. Each relief is bracketed by winged finial lights. Above all this is the high soaring dome of the ceiling covered with 120,000 stars, one for every man and woman in NSW who served in the Great War, made of plaster of paris and painted gold leaf. The height of the room is accentuated with the four grand cathedral windows of etched amber glass, designed by Dellit with Hoff.

To the west of Hall of Memory are the internal stairs from the ground floor vestibule. To the east is the Remembrance Flame Room, originally the Archives Room and intended to list the names of those 21,000 NSW men and women who died serving their county in the Great War. The room&#x27;s entrance is accentuated with pilasters and carvings. Over the doorway is carved &quot;1914–1918&quot; and above that is a winged flaming sword (a symbol of sacrifice) over a rising sun emblem. The room holds the Remembrance Flame that was first officially lit on 11 November 1995. The Great Doors to the room are left open to keep the flame exposed to view at all times. A braided rope hangs across the entrance to prevent visitors from entering.

;The exhibition space
The exhibition space occupies the southern office area originally provided for the RSL. In 1986, changes to the existing room layout were made, including removal of a number of small offices. The original Strong Room with its Chubb security door is still intact. The items displayed in the museum collection were donated by the public and they include personal letters, medals, books, diaries, uniforms, souvenirs, relics and banners relating to the various conflicts in which Australians were involved. In 2000 an Abloy anti-theft proof locking system was installed in the exhibition cases. To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Memorial in 2009, the space was refurbished (for example the original marquetry counter was reused as the visitor&#x27;s counter) and a new exhibition was installed.

;The Assembly Hall
Located opposite the entry vestibule on the eastern side of the memorial, the Assembly Hall was originally designed as a large open space used for meetings and forums by the different building occupants. In recent years it had been partitioned to allow for a smaller meeting space, office accommodation and archive storage at the northern end. It has been restored and reopened to the public, with new glazed doors to the east and west and a large freestanding AV unit, screening a short film about the Memorial. The room can also be used as a travelling exhibition space.

The original plans for the room proposed a raised dais on the southern endwith protruding stage and steps but this was never built. The original dais area was fitted as a kitchen for the memorial staff. This was subsequently removed in 2009, providing a linking space between the exhibition and the Assembly Hall.

The design of the room is more ornate than the general office space. The Art Deco detailing extends to the fittings and fixtures in the room. The ceiling is moulded with large Art Deco coffers and the walls are punctuated with plaster pilasters. A set of gold painted great doors opens back to reveal the sculpture &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. This room has marble door architraves and &quot;star lights&quot; designed by Dellit. The original flange wall lights are still in use and many of the original switches still exist in the room. The floors of the Assembly Hall are two-inch hardwood seasoned Red Mahogany.

The bearers are built directly onto the concrete slab. The flooring structure suggests that the original intent may have been to install parquetry flooring throughout the hall. These floor boards were lifted, patched, repaired and relaid as part of building works during 2009.

Offices for the TB Soldiers and Limbless Soldiers Association
The northern side of the ANZAC Memorial was originally designated for offices for the TB Soldiers Association and for the Limbless Soldiers Association with parquetry floors, marquetry counters and maple panelled timber partitions. The association&#x27;s rooms are accessed by the public from the front vestibule via a tiled corridor with maple-framed clerestory windows glazed with obscured glass. The offices as built did not follow the original plan. The original partitions in the TB Soldiers Association were removed in 1986 and substituted with aluminium-framed timber panel and glass partitions. These were subsequently replaced in 2009 with stud-framed plasterboard walls in a new configuration.

The Limbless Soldiers offices changed only slightly from the original layout. The marquetry counter ran across the room and the entrance door was placed to the top of this room. The general activity room was also changed just slightly from the plan, the door is in the middle of the room and the wall curves slightly to make a concave shape in the corridor. Building works in 2009 included restoration of the remaining original offices, creation of a new meeting room/library, kitchenette and management offices. The timber panelled partitions in this area are still in good order but only some of the original furniture remains. The Limbless Soldiers Association moved out of their offices in 2004 and the area has been used by the RSL since that date.

The original Chubb Strong Rooms are still retained in both rooms (there are three strong rooms in all).

;Basement
The basement of the ANZAC Memorial contains toilets for both men and women and the original timber lockers are still used by the memorial staff today. The basement has had some alterations within the original layout, however the toilet partitions and doors as well as many fixtures have not been altered and are in good order. Construction during 2009 included the insertion of a new disabled toilet (associated with the new lift), and a purpose-made cleaners room. Two light wells were originally created to provide fresh air and natural light for the toilets. These light wells now also contain the air conditioning plant, air intake and exhaust system for the building. A major stormwater pit (approximately 1m x 1m) is also located in the basement, in the central cleaner&#x27;s store with a submersible pump, and is known as the Underground Plant Room. The stairs and flooring of the basement are terrazzo in good condition. The partitions in the male and female toilets are marble and the original timber doors and hardware are in good order. In addition to the existing original timber handrail, a new brass handrail was added in 1985 to match the style of the handrail in the stairwell to the &quot;Hall of Memory&quot;.

;Undercroft and vertical security screens
The undercrofts are located under the external stairs leading to the podium level of the memorial. Originally intended for storage spaces for the offices of the RSL and the TB and Limbless Associations, they were largely unusable until 1992 when a water proof membrane was installed over the external stairs to deal with the damp and water ingress issues. The north undercroft now stores the original unused furniture from the memorial.

To provide protection against increasing vandalism of the ANZAC Memorial, external security screens were installed in 1999. The panels of the screen are made of safety glass etched with designs that continue the original concept of the symbolic use of building elements to reinforce the memorial&#x27;s purpose. When lowered (normally between 9am and 5pm) they are virtually invisible and allow unobstructed public access.

;The great doors and windows
There are ten sets of great doors to the building, seven on the ground floor and three on the podium level. All the doors are double leaf sliding doors of solid silky oak timber with brass furniture. The sets of external doors are painted green externally and gold internally. The doors slide on tracks that are recessed in the masonry walls of the building. The sets of doors are all panelled and decorated with carvings of urns, eternals flames, swords and crosses all symbolic of the memorial. These doors were repaired and repainted in 2006.

;Moveable heritage
There is an extensive collection of artefacts, items of memorabilia and tributes on display in the Museum space or stored in a number of small spaces on site, including one of the safes. These items have all been donated by members of the public.

;Mechanical and electrical services
Construction works during 2009 upgraded the services in the building, including the air-conditioning with the installation of new suspended services spine for ductwork, lighting and security services through the exhibition area and offices.

Many of the original electrical fittings remain in use in the building. These include switches and lighting. The original star lights, designed by Dellit and inspired by the stars on the ceiling of the Hall of Memories, are still used throughout the building. The original wall bracket light fittings in the Assembly Hall are also still used.

=== Condition ===

As at 26 February 2010, following many years of major catch-up maintenance and repair works, the general condition of the Memorial in 2010 is very good. Water ingress has been a constant issue within the building since it opened in 1934. In 2009 this was resolved with modifications to the podium drainage and paving system.

====Archaeology====
The archaeological potential of the site has not been formally assessed. Hyde Park was the site of Australia&#x27;s first race course and cricket pitch. Recent scholarship suggests Hyde Park north was also the site of a &quot;fighting ground&quot; for staging combative trials, first by the Aboriginal people between their own clans, later by Aboriginal people in demonstrating their fighting prowess against the British. Evidence associated with these uses as well as former park layouts may still exist within the park precinct, although it is likely to have been substantially disturbed by construction of the railway stations and tunnels as well as the memorial itself. The outlet to Busby&#x27;s Bore is immediately to the east of the memorial within the broader site curtilage.

The Anzac Memorial is remarkably intact, and contains a great deal of original fabric. This includes moveable items such as the wreath laid by the Duke of Gloucester.

=== Wreath ===

The memorial contains a number of moveable heritage items including the wreath, rail designed by Bruce Dellit. Two larger plaster models of the building and possibly some furniture within the office spaces.


== Heritage listing ==

As at 19 September 2011, The ANZAC Memorial, completed in 1934, is of historical significance to the State for its embodiment of the collective grief of the people of NSW at the loss of Australian servicemen and women since World War I. It is associated with the landing of Australian troops at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, since fundraising for the memorial was established on the first anniversary of the landing. It is also associated with returned servicemen and their organisations including the RSL, which lobbied for the erection of the monument and occupied offices within it. The ANZAC Memorial is of State aesthetic significance as a great work of public art which is arguably the finest expression of Art Deco monumentality in Australia. The result of an outstanding creative collaboration between architect Bruce Dellit and sculptor Rayner Hoff, it contains complex symbolic embellishments that reinforce and enhance the commemorative meanings of the building. Its landscape context in Hyde Park was purposefully designed for it by Dellit including the large Pool of Reflection lined by poplars. Its positioning on a major axis linked to the Archibald Fountain contributes significantly to the physical character of Hyde Park and the city of Sydney. The ANZAC Memorial is of State significance as the largest and most ambitious of the numerous war memorials constructed throughout NSW after the Great War. The memorial is also representative as NSW&#x27;s contribution to the group of &quot;national war memorials&quot;, whereby each state capital city developed its own major war memorial in the inter-war period. In this group the ANZAC Memorial is outstanding in its size, integrity and aesthetic appeal.

ANZAC War Memorial was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 April 2010 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The ANZAC Memorial in Hyde Park is of historical significance to the State as an embodiment of the collective grief felt by the people of New South Wales at the loss of Australian servicemen at Gallipoli and other conflicts since then. Authorised by NSW legislation in 1923, it is of State significance as a major place of commemoration and for its associations with the celebration of Anzac Day since 1941. The ANZAC Memorial is also of historical significance because its construction provided much needed employment for returned veterans during the Great Depression. The Lake of Reflection was constructed through the Unemployment Relief Fund established by the State government.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

The ANZAC Memorial is of State significance for its association with the landing of Australian troops at Gallipoli on 15 April 1915. The landing at Gallipoli was a significant event in Australian history, having an enormous impact on the Australian psyche and the formation of the Australian character and fundraising for the memorial was established on the first anniversary of the landing. This association is strengthened by the presence of an Aleppo Pine in the western ground of the memorial, taken from the Lone Pine at Lone Pine Gap in Gallipoli. The ANZAC Memorial is also of State significance for its association with returned servicemen and their organisations including the RSL, Limbless and Maimed Soldier&#x27;s Association and the T.B. Sailors and Soldier&#x27;s Association of Australia. These groups both lobbied for the erection of the monument and have occupied offices within it. The ANZAC Memorial is also of State significance as for its associations with its architect Bruce Dellit and its sculptor Rayner Hoff, both of whom are famous largely because of their design work in creating the memorial, which is arguably the finest Art Deco building in Australia. The memorial is associated with Anzac Day and the Anzac Day march on 25 April each year which starts at the Cenotaph and concludes near Hyde Park.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The ANZAC Memorial is of State aesthetic significance as a great work of public art which is arguably the finest expression of Art Deco monumentality in Australia. It is the result of an outstanding creative collaboration between architect Bruce Dellit and sculptor Rayner Hoff and contains complex symbolic embellishments that reinforce and enhance the commemorative meanings of the building. Its relative lack of religious symbology provides evidence of the processes of secularisation in NSW during the inter war period. The memorial has been praised for its &quot;unity of architecture, carving and sculpture&quot; and for &quot;achieving a remarkable dignity of expression&quot;. Rayner Hoff&#x27;s sculpture has been described as &quot;a masterpiece of craftsmanship... romantic without being sentimental, austere without being severe&quot; (Sturgeon). The ANZAC Memorial is also of State significance for the landscape purposefully designed for it by Dellit including a large reflection pool lined by poplars. The building is a prominent element in Hyde Park where it shares a principal axis with another major memorial to World War I, the Archibald Fountain. Its position contributes significantly to the physical character of Hyde Park and the city of Sydney.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The ANZAC Memorial is of State significance as a major focus for the public commemoration of Australians lost at war since its completion. Its construction is linked to acceptance of the term &quot;Anzac&quot; by the Australian people and the legend that is associated with the name. The memorial remains an integral part of Anzac Day commemorations each year. Its sculpture is likely to be of State social significance for its commemoration of the role of women in war, both as war workers and as mothers of soldiers, which was almost unheard of in the 1930s and remains unusual today. The Returned Soldiers Association of NSW wanted the memorial to be &quot;A lasting memorial, some outstanding legacy that shall quicken the blood of future generations, and move them to bare their heads in honoured memory of those who won for Australia its place amongst the nations&quot;. The ANZAC Memorial provides an important place of communal commemoration.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The ANZAC Memorial is of State significance for its rarity as an impressive and intact example of Art Deco public architecture. It is a rare example of a profound creative collaboration between architect and artist. The ANZAC Memorial is of State significance for its uniqueness as the grandest and most monumental war memorial in New South Wales.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The ANZAC Memorial is of State significance as the largest and most ambitious of the numerous war memorials constructed throughout New South Wales after World War I and as a remarkable example of commemorative architecture and Art Deco design. The memorial is also representative as NSW&#x27;s contribution to the group of &quot;national war memorials&quot;, whereby each state capital city developed its own major war memorial in the inter-war period. In this group the ANZAC Memorial is outstanding in its size, integrity and aesthetic appeal.

<text>Sadegh Hedayat ( ; 17 February 1903 – 9 April 1951) was an Iranian writer, poet and translator. Best known for his novel &quot;The Blind Owl&quot;, he was one of the earliest Iranian writers to adopt literary modernism in their career.

==Early life and education==

Hedayat was born to a northern Iranian aristocratic family in Tehran. His great-grandfather Reza-Qoli Khan Hedayat Tabarestani was a well-respected writer and worked in the government, as did other relatives. Hedayat&#x27;s sister married Haj Ali Razmara who was an army general and among the prime ministers of Iran under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Another one of his sisters was the wife of Abdollah Hedayat who was also an army general.

Hedayat was educated at &quot;Collège Saint-Louis&quot; (French catholic school) and Dar ol-Fonoon (1914–1916). In 1925, he was among a select few students who traveled to Europe to continue their studies. There, he initially went on to study engineering in Belgium, which he abandoned after a year to study architecture in France. There he gave up architecture in turn to pursue dentistry. In this period he became acquainted with Thérèse, a Parisian with whom he had a love affair. In 1927 Hedayat attempted suicide by throwing himself into the Marne but was rescued by a fishing boat. After four years in France, he finally surrendered his scholarship and returned home in the summer of 1930 without receiving a degree. In Iran, he held various jobs for short periods.

==Career==
Hedayat subsequently devoted his whole life to studying Western literature and to learning and investigating Iranian history and folklore. The works of Rainer Maria Rilke, Edgar Allan Poe, Franz Kafka, Anton Chekhov, and Guy de Maupassant intrigued him the most. During his short literary life span, Hedayat published a substantial number of short stories and novelettes, two historical dramas, a play, a travelogue, and a collection of satirical parodies and sketches. His writings also include numerous literary criticisms, studies in Persian folklore, and many translations from Middle Persian and French. He is credited with having brought the Persian language and literature into the mainstream of international contemporary writing.
Hedayat traveled and stayed in India from 1936 until late 1937 (the mansion he stayed in during his visit to Bombay was identified in 2014). Hedayet spent time in Bombay learning the Pahlavi (Middle Persian) language from the Parsi Zoroastrian community of India. He was taught by Bahramgore Tahmuras Anklesaria (also spelled as Behramgore Tehmurasp Anklesaria), a renowned scholar and philologist. Nadeem Akhtar&#x27;s &quot;Hedayat in India&quot; provides details of Hedayat&#x27;s sojourn in India. In Bombay Hedayat completed and published his most enduring work, &quot;The Blind Owl&quot;, which he had started writing, in Paris, as early as 1930. The book was praised by Henry Miller, André Breton, and others, and Kamran Sharareh has called it &quot;one of the most important literary works in the Persian language&quot;.

==Vegetarianism==
Hedayat was a vegetarian from his youth and authored the treatise &quot;The Benefits of Vegetarianism&quot; whilst in Berlin in 1927.

==Death and legacy==
In 1951, overwhelmed by despair, Hedayat left Tehrān and traveled to Paris, where he rented an apartment. A few days before his death, Hedayat tore up all of his unpublished work. On 9 April 1951, he plugged all the doors and windows of his rented apartment with cotton, then turned on the gas valve, committing suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. Two days later, his body was found by police, with a note left behind for his friends and companions that read, &quot;I left and broke your heart. That is all.&quot; He is widely remembered as &quot;a major symbol of Iranian nationalism.&quot;

The English poet John Heath-Stubbs published an elegy, &quot;A Cassida for Sadegh Hedayat&quot;, in &quot;A Charm Against the Toothache&quot; in 1954.

==Censorship==

In November 2006, republication of Hedayat&#x27;s work in uncensored form was banned in Iran, as part of a sweeping purge. However, surveillance of bookstalls is limited and it is still possible to purchase the originals second-hand. The official website is also still online. The issue of censorship is discussed in:
* &quot;City Report: Tehran&quot; in &quot;Frieze&quot;, issue 86, October 2004, which examines Iranian censorship in general;
* An article by Robert Tait in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 17 November 2006;
* an article published by Radio Free Europe — Radio Liberty on 26 November 2007.

*In life there are certain sores that, like a canker, gnaw at the soul in solitude and diminish it. (&quot;opening line&quot;)

==Films about Hedayat==

* In 1987, Raul Ruiz made the feature film &quot;La Chouette aveugle&quot; in France: a loose adaption of Hedayat&#x27;s novel &quot;The Blind Owl&quot;. Its formal innovations led critics and filmmakers to declare the film &#x27;French cinema&#x27;s most beautiful jewel of the past decade.&#x27;
* Hedayat&#x27;s last day and the night was adapted into the short film, &quot;The Sacred and the Absurd&quot;, directed by Ghasem Ebrahimian, which was featured in the Tribeca Film Festival in 2004.
* In 2005, Iranian film director Khosrow Sinai has made a docudrama about Hedayat entitled &quot;Goftogu ba saye = Talking with a shadow&quot;. Its main theme is the influence of Western movies such as &quot;Der Golem&quot;, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, and &quot;Dracula&quot; on Hedayat.
* In 2009, Mohsen Shahrnazdar and Sam Kalantari made a documentary film about Sadegh Hedayat named &quot;From No. 37&quot;.

<doc id="946426" wikidata="Q477284" url="?curid=946426" title="Amplitude-shift keying">
<text>Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is a form of amplitude modulation that represents digital data as variations in the amplitude of a carrier wave. In an ASK system, a symbol, representing one or more bits, is sent by transmitting a fixed-amplitude carrier wave at a fixed frequency for a specific time duration. For example, if each symbol represents a single bit, then the carrier signal could be transmitted at nominal amplitude when the input value is 1, but transmitted at reduced amplitude or not at all when the input value is 0.

==Method==
Any digital modulation scheme uses a number of distinct signals to represent digital data. ASK uses a finite number of amplitudes, each assigned a unique pattern of binary digits. Usually, each amplitude encodes an equal number of bits. Each pattern of bits forms the symbol that is represented by the particular amplitude. The demodulator, which is designed specifically for the symbol-set used by the modulator, determines the amplitude of the received signal and maps it back to the symbol it represents, thus recovering the original data. Frequency and phase of the carrier are kept constant.

Like AM, an ASK is also linear and sensitive to atmospheric noise, distortions, propagation conditions on different routes in PSTN, etc. Both ASK modulation and demodulation processes are relatively inexpensive. The ASK technique is also commonly used to transmit digital data over optical fiber. For LED transmitters, binary 1 is represented by a short pulse of light and binary 0 by the absence of light. Laser transmitters normally have a fixed &quot;bias&quot; current that causes the device to emit a low light level. This low level represents binary 0, while a higher-amplitude lightwave represents binary 1.

The simplest and most common form of ASK operates as a switch, using the presence of a carrier wave to indicate a binary one and its absence to indicate a binary zero. This type of modulation is called on-off keying (OOK), and is used at radio frequencies to transmit Morse code (referred to as continuous wave operation),

More sophisticated encoding schemes have been developed which represent data in groups using additional amplitude levels. For instance, a four-level encoding scheme can represent two bits with each shift in amplitude; an eight-level scheme can represent three bits; and so on. These forms of amplitude-shift keying require a high signal-to-noise ratio for their recovery, as by their nature much of the signal is transmitted at reduced power.

ASK system can be divided into three blocks. The first one represents the transmitter, the second one is a linear model of the effects of the channel, the third one shows the structure of the receiver. The following notation is used:
* &quot;ht&quot;(f) is the carrier signal for the transmission
* &quot;hc&quot;(f) is the impulse response of the channel
* &quot;n&quot;(t) is the noise introduced by the channel
* &quot;hr&quot;(f) is the filter at the receiver
* &quot;L&quot; is the number of levels that are used for transmission
* &quot;T&quot;s is the time between the generation of two symbols

Different symbols are represented with different voltages. If the maximum allowed value for the voltage is A, then all the possible values are in the range [−A, A] and they are given by:

:formula_1

the difference between one voltage and the other is:

:formula_2

Considering the picture, the symbols v[n] are generated randomly by the source S, then the impulse generator creates impulses with an area of v[n]. These impulses are sent to the filter ht to be sent through the channel. In other words, for each symbol a different carrier wave is sent with the relative amplitude.

Out of the transmitter, the signal s(t) can be expressed in the form:

:formula_3

In the receiver, after the filtering through hr (t) the signal is:

:formula_4

where we use the notation:

:formula_5

where * indicates the convolution between two signals. After the A/D conversion the signal z[k] can be expressed in the form:

:formula_6

In this relationship, the second term represents the symbol to be extracted. The others are unwanted: the first one is the effect of noise, the third one is due to the intersymbol interference.

If the filters are chosen so that g(t) will satisfy the Nyquist ISI criterion, then there will be no intersymbol interference and the value of the sum will be zero, so:

:formula_7

the transmission will be affected only by noise.

== Probability of error ==

The probability density function of having an error of a given size can be modelled by a Gaussian function; the mean value will be the relative sent value, and its variance will be given by:

:formula_8

where formula_9 is the spectral density of the noise within the band and Hr (f) is the continuous Fourier transform of the impulse response of the filter hr (f).

The probability of making an error is given by:

:formula_10

where, for example, formula_11 is the conditional probability of making an error given that a symbol v0 has been sent and formula_12 is the probability of sending a symbol v0.

If the probability of sending any symbol is the same, then:

:formula_13

If we represent all the probability density functions on the same plot against the possible value of the voltage to be transmitted, we get a picture like this (the particular case of formula_14 is shown):

The probability of making an error after a single symbol has been sent is the area of the Gaussian function falling under the functions for the other symbols. It is shown in cyan for just one of them. If we call formula_15 the area under one side of the Gaussian, the sum of all the areas will be: formula_16. The total probability of making an error can be expressed in the form:

:formula_17

We now have to calculate the value of formula_15. In order to do that, we can move the origin of the reference wherever we want: the area below the function will not change. We are in a situation like the one shown in the following picture:

it does not matter which Gaussian function we are considering, the area we want to calculate will be the same. The value we are looking for will be given by the following integral:

:formula_19

where formula_20 is the complementary error function. Putting all these results together, the probability to make an error is:

:formula_21

from this formula we can easily understand that the probability to make an error decreases if the maximum amplitude of the transmitted signal or the amplification of the system becomes greater; on the other hand, it increases if the number of levels or the power of noise becomes greater.

This relationship is valid when there is no intersymbol interference, i.e. formula_22 is a Nyquist function.

<doc id="946432" wikidata="Q7898274" url="?curid=946432" title="Upfield Bike Path">
<text>The Upfield Shared Path is a shared use path for cyclists and pedestrians, which follows Upfield railway line through the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

It stretches from Princes Park, through Brunswick and Coburg, to Box Forest Road, Fawkner, just south of Gowrie railway station. It was originally opened in the late 1980s.

Missing links have been progressively filled with the work between Hope Street and Anstey railway station in Brunswick completed in August 2002. A section between Reynard and O&#x27;Hea Streets in Coburg with a signalled crossing at Bell Street was completed by 2006 by City of Moreland (now City of Merri-bek) Council and VicRoads. An extension to Box Forest Road was completed in September 2008.

An interactive map of the trail as well as others in the Melbourne area is available here.

==Following the path==
The southern end of the Upfield Bike Path connects to the Capital City Trail on the old Inner Circle railway line reservation which provides access to the Merri Creek Trail at Rushall railway station; and in the other direction it passes near the Melbourne Zoo before connecting with the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail.

Alternatively, at Park Street cyclists can join the Royal Parade bike path and on road bike lane which provides access to University of Melbourne main campus in Parkville.

City of Moreland Council has reported the number of people counted riding on the Upfield Bike Path and Sydney Road at Park Street has almost quadrupled from 1992 to 2003. The 24-hour weekday average was 804 in 
February 2008.

The Upfield path parallels Sydney Road shopping strip in Brunswick and Coburg, and is often used by pedestrians and cyclists for shopping, dog walking as well as commuter cycling.

Historic buildings along the path include the Brunswick Baths at Dawson Street and the Railway Hotel (now a Backpackers Hostel) at Albert Street, Brunswick.

==Landmarks==
Upfield railway line, Melbourne Zoo.

==Solar lighting at Fawkner Cemetery==
The section passing the Fawkner Cemetery was upgraded in February 2009 to include the world&#x27;s first shared-pathway, solar lighting schema. Stonnington City Council introduced solar lighting on the Gardiners Creek Trail in May 2007. However they did not make use of a color schema as seen on the Upfield Bike path.

Previously the path was without lights and unfriendly to riders. The new array of red LED on the left and white LED on the right, creates a delineated &quot;airport runway&quot; style, visually stunning, lighting grid, providing up to 600 meters of visible pathway for riders, even at the darkest hours. Hazards are indicated using amber LED.

For safety, the lights are mounted flush with the ground where they absorb more than enough energy, stored in their environmentally friendly super capacitors during daylight, to provide up to 14 hours of continuous lighting.

==Connections==
*The path comes to a dead end in the north at Box Forest Road at Fawkner Cemetery.
*It meets the Capital City Trail in the south.

The Western Ring Road Trail is 1.4 km to the north, up Sydney Road, from the most northerly end of the trail.

North end at .
South end at .

==Cultural references==
Upfield Bike Path is the name and subject matter of a song by Melbourne indie band &quot;Huon&quot;. The track appears on the compilation album &quot;Kraftworks&quot;.

<text>Scarborough Football Club was a football club based in the seaside resort of Scarborough, North Yorkshire. They were one of the oldest football clubs in England, formed in 1879, before they were wound up on 20 June 2007, with debts of £2.5 million. They played at the Athletic Ground from 1898 until the club&#x27;s dissolution.

Scarborough formed in 1879 and entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1887. They entered the Northern League in 1898 and remained there for 28 years, apart from four seasons spent in the Yorkshire Combination from 1910 to 1914. They moved to the Yorkshire League in 1926 and switched to the Midland League the following year, being crowned as Midlands League champions in 1929–30. In 1960, they moved into the Northern Counties League, and would win the North Eastern League title in their only season in the division – 1962–63. Returning to the Midland League, they became founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. They won the FA Trophy on three occasions in the 1970s: 1973, 1975–76 and 1976–77, and were runners-up in 1974–75.

Scarborough were founder members of the Alliance Premier League (later named the Conference) in 1979 and in 1987 were the first team to secure automatic promotion to the Football League, which had been introduced for the 1986-87 season. They were relegated back down to the Conference in 1999, and then were relegated into the Conference North after entering administration in 2006. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Scarborough finished in 20th place, which would have resulted in their relegation to the Northern Premier League had the club not instead been liquidated. A new supporter-owned &#x27;phoenix&#x27; club was established by the Seadog Trust under the banner Scarborough Athletic on 25 June 2007, and one year later a second supporter-owned club, Scarborough Town, also came into existence, which itself folded in 2013.

==History==
The club was formed in 1879 by members of the town&#x27;s cricket team, and played their earliest games at the cricket ground on North Marine Road. The football club soon moved to the nearby Recreation Ground. In 1898, Scarborough Football Club made the move across town to the Athletic Ground on Seamer Road and remained there until 2007, though the ground was renamed The McCain Stadium in a pioneering sponsorship deal in 1988.

===Early years===

Scarborough first entered England&#x27;s national cup competition, the FA Cup, in 1887. Before the club became professional they spent their time competing in the Northern League.

It was in 1927 the Yorkshire club became professional and joined the Midland League. After only three years they became champions of it, breaking the record for most points in a season. The same year, the club were performing respectably in the FA Cup, reaching the Third Round before going out 2–1 to Grimsby Town who were in the nation&#x27;s top league at the time.

Club attendance records were broken when the club reached the same stage of the FA Cup again, during the 1937–38 season. The game against Luton Town, which was a 1–1 draw, saw 11,162 people packed into the Athletic Ground. Unfortunately for Scarborough they were soundly defeated 5–1 in the replay.

===1970s FA Trophy success===
Because of their decent performance in the Midlands League, the club were entitled to become one of the founding clubs in the new Northern Premier League in 1968. The 1970s would prove to be a successful time for the club; Scarborough FC won the FA Trophy three times at Wembley Stadium, beating Wigan Athletic, Stafford Rangers and Dagenham in the process.

However, there was also a tragedy for the club during the 1970s. On 18 May 1977, 21-year-old winger Tony Aveyard died after collapsing as a result of a head injury suffered in a match two days earlier.

The 1970s also saw the club performing well in the FA Cup. They reached the Third Round in the 1975–76 season before losing 2–1 to Crystal Palace in a match that was featured on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. During the 1977–78 season, they reached these heights again, with a Third Round clash against Brighton and Hove Albion; they lost the tie 3–0 at the Goldstone Ground in front of 23,748 spectators.

They also took part in the Anglo-Italian Cup twice, beating Udinese 4–0 in 1976 and then beating Parma 2–0 during the following year&#x27;s competition. In 1976 they lost 4–1 on aggregate to Italian side US Lecce in the final match of the Anglo-Italian Semiprofessional Tournament. Gordon Banks played for Scarborough, in the opening game of that season’s competition (versus S.S. Monza 1912). By the end of the 1970s, Scarborough had been selected to be part of the new Alliance Premier League, known today as the Football Conference. They stayed in this league for several seasons with generally consistent finishing positions in mid-table. The club gained a new manager named Neil Warnock, and his team became champions of the Conference in 1987. They were automatically promoted into the Football League, the first club to achieve this feat by this route.

===The Football League era===
In 1987 Scarborough were promoted into the Football League Fourth Division. Scarborough hosted Wolves on the first day of the season, an event which attracted national media attention, due to it being the club&#x27;s debut match in the Football League. However the match was marred by crowd trouble provoked by visiting Wolves supporters, with players having to leave the pitch during the match.

Warnock stayed as manager of Scarborough until he left for Notts County in November 1988, and has since gone on to win numerous promotions for a string of league clubs. However, the subsequent years were rather less successful for Scarborough.

Scarborough qualified for the Fourth Division play-offs in 1989, courtesy of a fifth-place finish. They were knocked out at the semi-final stage 2–1 on aggregate by Leyton Orient.

The club had mixed fortunes during their stay in the Football League. They spent several seasons near the bottom, but reached the play-offs for promotion twice. They became giant killers in 1989 with a 3–2 victory in the League Cup over Chelsea, after achieving a 1–1 draw during the first leg at Stamford Bridge. Their cup runs continued to throw up good results following this, with a 7–6 aggregate win over Preston North End, and a 5–3 defeat against Southampton (including 2 goals from Alan Shearer) in 1991. In October 1989, however, Scarborough lost 7–0 to eventual runners-up Oldham Athletic, in which Frankie Bunn scored six of Oldham&#x27;s goals, a record for an individual player that still stands.

Their best run however came during the 1992–93 season, where Scarborough knocked Bradford City, Coventry City and Plymouth Argyle out of the competition. This brought Arsenal to Scarborough in a tie which Arsenal narrowly won, 1–0 with a Nigel Winterburn goal. Arsenal went on to win the League Cup that year.

In 1998, they qualified for the Division Three playoffs, but lost to Torquay United in the semi-finals. The following season would bring a relegation battle rather than a promotion challenge.

The last day of the 1998–99 season  – 8 May 1999 – saw Scarborough FC&#x27;s final game as a Football League club, which they drew 1–1 at home to a Peterborough United side which featured future Premier League stars Simon Davies and Matthew Etherington. When the final whistle blew at the McCain Stadium, Carlisle were still level with Plymouth Argyle and the Scarborough fans had already invaded the pitch to celebrate &quot;survival&quot;, only for the news to come through within minutes that a last-minute goal from Carlisle United&#x27;s on-loan goalkeeper Jimmy Glass had ensured Carlisle&#x27;s survival and relegated Scarborough back to the Conference, twelve years after they had left it. It was the first relegation in the history of Scarborough FC.

===Back in non-league football===
The 1999–2000 season would begin for Scarborough in the Conference – the same league they had won twelve years earlier. However, in their first season they only managed to finish in fourth place, thus failing to win promotion at the first attempt. The club maintained their football league youth policy. In this first season in the conference, the club&#x27;s youth team, led by youth team manager Ian Kerr, won the football league youth alliance winning their last five games against Hull City, Bradford City, Preston North End, Carlisle United and Wrexham without conceding a goal.

Poor results saw Scarborough at the bottom of the Conference by Christmas 2001. With relegation to the Northern Premier League threatening, new chairman Malcolm Reynolds and manager Russell Slade oversaw a turnaround in the club&#x27;s fortunes; the team finished 12th at the end of the 2001–02 season. This was followed up by a 7th-place finish the following season.

2003–04 brought a 15th-place finish in the Conference, with the highlight of the season being an FA Cup 4th-Round tie with Chelsea at the renamed McCain Stadium. Chelsea and England defender John Terry scored the only goal of the game. Slade left to join Grimsby Town, Nick Henry was appointed his successor and brought in his former Oldham Athletic team-mate Neil Redfearn as his assistant.

In the 2004–05 season, despite only finishing 13th in the league, Scarborough managed to go through the whole season unbeaten at home.

With the club at the bottom of the Conference, manager Nick Henry was sacked in October 2005. Neil Redfearn took over as manager and brought in former Barnsley coach Eric Winstanley as assistant manager. Despite finishing bottom of the table in 2005–06, Scarborough were not initially relegated, as Canvey Island resigned from the league and Altrincham were deducted 18 points for fielding an ineligible player, meaning that they occupied bottom position instead. However the Conference were not convinced of the club&#x27;s financial stability, and Scarborough ended up suffering the same fate as Northwich Victoria had the previous year by being relegated to the Conference North.

===Final season===
Neil Redfearn resigned in the 2006 close season and former Scarborough skipper and assistant manager Mark Patterson replaced him. Patterson re-signed striker Tony Hackworth and defender Mark Hotte. The club started their first season in the Conference North with minus 10 points as the club had been in administration. What proved to be their last game, on 28 April 2007, was a 1–0 win at Hucknall Town. However, Scarborough finished 20th meaning that had they survived until the start of the 2007–08 season, they would have been relegated to the Northern Premier League. On 4 May 2007 Mark Patterson left the club after failing to agree a new contract.

===Dissolution===
The club had been hoping to move to a new stadium on the outskirts of town by the start of the 2009–10 season, with the proceeds from the sale of the McCain Stadium to a housing developer wiping out the club&#x27;s historic debts in addition to providing the finance to build the new ground. However, a covenant existed on the McCain Stadium that restricted its use only to sporting activities. Scarborough failed to convince Scarborough Borough Council that the proposals would raise enough money to both pay off the club&#x27;s debts and build a new ground. In 2017, the site of the stadium became a Lidl supermarket.

On Friday 8 June 2007, the FA in London said that it was a very strong possibility that by 12 June Scarborough F.C. may well go out of business. On Tuesday 12 June, the club was given an eight-day &#x27;stay of execution&#x27; following a &#x27;change of heart&#x27; by their local Borough Council. But on 20 June it was wound up in the High Court, ending its 128-year run as a club with debts of £2.5 million.

However, the winding up of Scarborough F.C paved the way for the supporter&#x27;s trust to form a club as Scarborough Athletic and secure a place in the Northern Counties East League. Meanwhile, the Centre of Excellence, youth team and Football in the Community sections of Scarborough F.C. moved to the nearby George Pindar Community Sports College, with some assistance from Sheffield United. In 2008 the youth system was extended by adding an adult team named Scarborough Town, which was admitted to the Teesside League for 2008–09 and won the championship of Division Two by going the entire season undefeated. In 2009–10 Scarborough Town moved up into the Wearside League and scored 140 goals in their 36 games as they won the championship and also the Sunderland Shipowners Cup. Scarborough Town F.C. folded in June 2013.

==Programme and fanzine==
The match-day programme at Scarborough, The Boro Review, won the Conference North programme awards for 2006–07. The club also had a fanzine, &quot;Abandon chip!&quot;, which at the end of the 2006–07 season had reached Issue 5, and still continues today as a Scarborough Athletic fanzine.

<text>Pulicat or Pazhaverkadu is a historic seashore town in Chennai Metropolitan Area at Thiruvallur District, of Tamil Nadu state, India. It is about north of Chennai and from Elavur, on the southern periphery of the Pulicat Lake. Pulicat lake is a shallow salt water lagoon which stretches about along the coast. With lakeside and seashore development as well as several Special Economic Zones (SEZs) including a US$1 billion Medical SEZ, coming up in nearby Elavur, land prices in the area are rising.

==History==

The Portuguese established a trading post in Pulicat in 1502 with the help of the Vijayanagar rulers. They built a fort there and held this fort until 1609 when they were defeated by the Dutch. The Dutch occupied Pulicat fort in 1609. Between 1621 and 1665, 131 slave ships were deployed by the Dutch to export 38,441 Indians captured on the Coromandel coast and transported from Pulicat to be sold as slaves to Dutch plantations in Batavia. Pulicat was till 1690 the capital of Dutch Coromandel. It repeatedly changed possession, until finally occupied by the British in 1825. It became part of the Madras Presidency, which later became Madras state in independent India and renamed Tamil Nadu in 1968. The Dutch church has been built over several times and is rather dilapidated today, and the Dutch fort has fallen into ruin. The old lighthouse still stands at the opposite bank of the lake. The cemetery dating to 1622 has been taken under the wing of the Archaeological Survey of India and so has survived the passage of time. The grand, Dutch-inscribed tombs and graves, carved with skeletons rather than the cross, have been quite well preserved. The cemetery lies behind the market.

Aadhi Narayana Perumal temple is an old temple located at Pazhaverkadu.

Pulicat-Day is celebrated on World Wetland Day (2 February) at Pulicat by AARDE Foundation. Famous traditional catamaran competition and several competitions are held on this day. Small information center (Pulicat Museum) at Pazhaverkadu gives detailed information on Pulicat ecology and built heritage.

==Fort Geldria==

Fort Geldria or Fort Geldaria, located in Pulicat, was the seat of the Dutch Republic&#x27;s first settlement in India, and the capital of Dutch Coromandel. It was built by the Dutch East India Company in 1613 and became the local governmental centre in 1616. It was named for Geldria, the native province of Wemmer van Berchem, the General Director of the company. Regularly protected by a garrison of 80 to 90 men, Fort Geldria was the only fortification in the Indian empire; all other positions of the Dutch Company were trading posts.

==Wildlife==
Pulicat is within the Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary. Every year between the months of October and March, thousands of migratory birds land here. Though many species can be seen, the Flamingos are the most visible, covering the swamps surrounding the lake, giving it a pink tinge.

<text>KUTP (channel 45), branded Fox 10 Xtra, is a television station in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, broadcasting the MyNetworkTV programming service. It is owned and operated by Fox Television Stations alongside Fox outlet KSAZ-TV (channel 10). The two stations share studios on West Adams Street in Downtown Phoenix; KUTP&#x27;s transmitter is located atop South Mountain.

==History==
===Early years===
In May 1984, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated channel 45 to Phoenix and began taking applications for the channel after United Television, a subsidiary of Chris-Craft Industries, petitioned for the additional slot. United soon got competition for the channel from another twelve applicants, Undeterred, United bought out all of the competitors for a reported $5 million and won a construction permit on December 20, 1984.

United immediately set out to bring Phoenix its third independent station alongside the existing KPHO-TV and KNXV. It originally proposed to become KOLT-TV (as in &quot;Kolt 45&quot;), but United could not convince radio station KOLT in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, to give it the rights to share the designation. On December 23, 1985, a year after obtaining the construction permit, KUTP came to air as the only station United would build and sign on from the ground-up in the company&#x27;s history. Along with movies and syndicated programs, United commissioned a revival of &quot;The Lloyd Thaxton Show&quot;, last seen in Los Angeles in the late 1960s, as a centerpiece of its programming efforts. In 1988, United made an even more consequential pickup when it signed a deal to telecast away games of the Phoenix Suns. The initial deal saw the station receive the rights to 25 road games for five years, with the figure increasing to 30 beginning in the 1990–91 season and to 41 games by the mid-1990s, when the Suns were the station&#x27;s chief viewership draw.

Under United Television ownership, the station carried programming from the Prime Time Entertainment Network programming service from January 1993 to January 1995. In the fall of 1994, United Television and Paramount Pictures announced the formation of the United Paramount Network (UPN), lining up independent stations that were owned by both companies at the time as charter affiliates; KUTP affiliated with UPN upon the network&#x27;s January 16, 1995, debut.

In 2000, Paramount parent company Viacom bought Chris-Craft&#x27;s 50% ownership interest in UPN (which Chris-Craft had wholly owned, until Viacom acquired a stake in the network in 1996). On August 12 of that year, Chris-Craft sold its UPN stations to the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of News Corporation for $5.5 billion; this resulted in the creation of Phoenix&#x27;s second television duopoly with KSAZ. KUTP merged its operations with KSAZ into that station&#x27;s studio facilities on West Adams Street.

===From UPN to MyNetworkTV===

On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down UPN and The WB and combine the networks&#x27; respective programming to create a new jointly owned broadcast network called The CW.

In unveiling the merged network, while WB and UPN affiliates owned by WB minority stakeholder Tribune Broadcasting and by CBS Television Stations were announced as charter outlets, none of the Fox-owned UPN stations—many of which were competitors to these stations—were chosen. Even though neither of these groups were present in Phoenix, as with the rest of the chain, Fox took immediate steps to remove UPN branding and promotions from KUTP, which branded as &quot;PHX 45&quot; for six months. The next month, News Corporation then announced the creation of its own secondary network, MyNetworkTV, to serve its own outgoing UPN stations as well as those that had not been selected for The CW. (Phoenix&#x27;s WB affiliate, KASW, then signed an affiliation agreement with The CW; it is now an independent station.) Coinciding with the September 2006 launch of MyNetworkTV, Fox announced that KUTP would begin producing a local interactive dating show, &quot;My Dating Place&quot;, which aired on weeknights.

On August 7, 2017, KUTP was re-branded as &quot;Fox 10 Xtra&quot;, a brand extension of KSAZ-TV, adding a two-hour block of the latter&#x27;s live streaming YouTube channel &quot;Fox 10 News Now&quot; Monday through Friday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.

==Local programming==

===Newscasts===
Beginning in 2018, KSAZ-TV produced a 7 p.m. newscast, &quot;Fox 10 Xtra News at 7&quot;, for air on KUTP; this program, the station&#x27;s first regular newscast, debuted in July 2018. In addition, the station airs two hours of LiveNow from Fox, the Fox television stations&#x27; over-the-top streaming news offering, which originated as &quot;Fox 10 News Now&quot; in Phoenix.

In February 2022, KUTP began simulcast programming from Fox Weather. This programming airs from 1 to 2 p.m. on weekdays, and from 4 to 6 a.m. on Sundays.

===Sports programming===
For 23 years, from 1988 to 2011, KUTP served as the over-the-air television home of the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns, televising all road games that did not have exclusive rights held by a national broadcast or cable television network, as well as selected home games, averaging at least 45 game telecasts each season. KUTP produced its own broadcast graphics, in conjunction with the Suns until the 2010–11 NBA season; this role of the regional television broadcaster of Suns games was taken over thereafter by corporate sibling Fox Sports Arizona (later Bally Sports Arizona) without any over-the-air rights, from 2011 to 2023.

Basketball returned to channel 45 in 2019 when Grand Canyon University entered into a deal to move men&#x27;s basketball coverage from YurView Arizona, a cable channel, to KUTP; the games are produced by Sneaky Big Studios for GCU and KUTP. The agreement was renewed for the 2021–22 season, adding women&#x27;s basketball and men&#x27;s baseball broadcasts. The agreement was expanded for the 2022–23 season, adding a softball broadcast for the first time.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KUTP shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 45, at 8:30 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 26, using virtual channel 45.

<doc id="946469" wikidata="Q6761994" url="?curid=946469" title="Marian University (Indiana)">
<text>Marian University is a private Catholic university in Indianapolis, Indiana. Founded in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis in Oldenburg, Indiana, the college moved to Indianapolis in 1937. Marian was known as Marian College from 1936 until 2009. 

In 2013, the university opened the first medical school in over 100 years in Indiana, which was the first osteopathic medical school in the state and the second operational medical school in Indiana at the time. As of 2017, enrollment included 2,431 undergraduate students, 1,164 graduate students, and 650 doctoral students.

Marian University athletes have won 45 USA Cycling National Championships and 8 NAIA National Championships: football in 2012 and 2015; women&#x27;s basketball in 2016 and 2017; men&#x27;s track and field 60-meter hurdles in 2016 and 2017, and 110-meter hurdles and 800 meter in 2017. Their mascot is Knightro the Knight.

Daniel Elsener, Marian University&#x27;s president, has an annual compensation package of $684,746. The school has allegedly championed conservative causes and Christian Nationalism while silencing moderate or liberal-leaning viewpoints from students, faculty, and staff. On July 24, 2020, Marian University hosted Vice President Mike Pence to discuss safely reopening schools in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic despite the Trump-Pence administration&#x27;s hugely unpopular and botched pandemic response efforts. 

Marian University has played a significant role in shrinking school vouchers and charter schools while actively dismantling public school systems. In 2025, Rep. Bob Behning (R), who is also Assistant Vice President and Director of the Center of Vibrant Schools at Marian University, authored House Bill 1002 which, among other things, will allow Indiana schools to eliminate transportation, eliminate pre-K programs, eliminate arts funding, eliminate cultural competency, eliminate world religions courses, and eliminate the requirements that the Indiana Secretary of Education reside in the State of Indiana. Marian University Preparatory School, a k-12 school created by the university, has a total enrollment of 3 students. 

==History==
Marian University was founded in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Indiana, as a liberal arts school with a program for training teachers. Under the direction of Father Francis Joseph Rudolph and Mother Theresa Hackelmeier, teachers were trained at Oldenburg for more than a decade before Indiana adopted its first tax-supported normal school.

Originally known as St. Francis Normal, the school became a four-year, state-approved institution which merged with Immaculate Conception Junior College to form Marian College. In November 1936, the Sisters of St. Francis purchased the former James A. Allison estate, &quot;Riverdale,&quot; located in Indianapolis, as a site for Marian College.

In 1937, the institution moved to Indianapolis under the direction of Mother M. Clarissa Dillhoff, after securing a state charter and purchasing the Riverdale estate in 1936. Allison Mansion became the new location of Marian College. The building housed the library, administrative offices, classrooms, and sleeping quarters for the Sisters. Classes began on September 15, 1937.

In 1948 the institution began an expansion project that included the addition of Clare Hall, the Gymnasium, and Marian Hall. In 1954, as the new Marian Hall was completed, the institution became the first co-educational Catholic college in Indiana. Two years later, the North Central Association accredited Marian College.

The university&#x27;s Modernist-style library was designed by noted Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III, the principal and founder of Woollen, Molzan and Partners, and completed in 1966. The library&#x27;s square form has an exposed structural frame and open staircase with stacks arranged around reading areas.

The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education formally accepted all teacher education programs of the college in 1976. The Indiana State Board of Nursing approved the associate level nursing curriculum in 1977 and the baccalaureate program in 1987. The National League of Nursing has accredited both programs—the associate in 1986 and the baccalaureate in 1992. In 2000, Marian&#x27;s Adult Programs (MAP) began offering bachelor&#x27;s and associate degrees in business.

On July 1, 2009, Marian College became Marian University. Over the course of several years prior to this, the college grew and expanded the academic curriculum, added a football team and marching band, adding and renovating buildings.

On January 15, 2010, Marian University announced plans to begin a college of osteopathic medicine; the second in the state of Indiana and the first Catholic osteopathic medical school due to the generosity of an anonymous donor&#x27;s $30 million pledge. On August 23, 2011, during the groundbreaking ceremony, the new school of osteopathic medicine building was officially named after the erstwhile anonymous donor, AIT Labs CEO Michael A. Evans. Additionally, Margaret Mary Community Hospital pledged $150,000 to the College of Osteopathic Medicine dedicated to building a simulation lab and seminar room for the medical students.

In July 2021, Ancilla College and Marian officially merged and opened as the Marian University&#x27;s Ancilla College in Donaldson, Indiana.

==Campus==
Marian University is located about four miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis, on a 200-acre campus. The Marian University campus includes: 
* The Nina Mason Pulliam EcoLab, a 55-acre wetland and lowland forest located on the north end of the Marian University campus.
* The Riverdale Estate, which includes Allison Mansion and Indiana&#x27;s largest and most intact landscape designed by Jens Jensen. The mansion holds the offices of the president.
* The Lake Sullivan Sports Complex, now known as the Indy Cycloplex, which Marian operates for the City of Indianapolis Parks and Recreation Department. This park is home to the Major Taylor Velodrome and Indy Cycloplex BMX track, as well as singletrack MTB trails and a dual slalom course, and hosts races, clinics, and other events in all cycling disciplines, as well as community events.

==Academics==
As of 2017, Marian University served 2,431 undergraduate students, 1,164 graduate students, and 650 medical students with a student-faculty ratio of 14:1. Marian University is accredited by North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

Marian University is organized into five schools with 40 majors, 46 minors, and 26 concentrations:
* Clark H. Byrum School of Business
* College of Osteopathic Medicine
* College of Arts and Sciences
* The Educators College
* Alan and Sue Leighton School of Nursing

Marian University offers several routes to earning a teaching license via Indianapolis Teaching Fellows, traditional education program, Master&#x27;s Bridge to Teaching, the Master of Arts in Teaching program, and the ACTION program. Marian University is one of the few universities to offer the Leadership Academy for Principals.

Marian University Leighton School of Nursing offers several degree programs including an online Accelerated BSN program that can be completed in as few as 16 months.

Marian University College of Osteopathic Medicine opened in August 2013 with the first-class graduated 133 doctors of osteopathic medicine.
The university also offers accelerated degree programs in business for adults through Marian&#x27;s Adult Programs (MAP). 

On the Ancilla College campus, seven degree programs are offered as of Spring of 2021. These include a Bachelor&#x27;s in Nursing as well as Associate&#x27;s in Agriculture, Business, Education, Exercise Science, Liberal Arts, and Veterinary Nursing.

==Student life==
The Student Government Association of Marian University (SGA) is actively involved with campus events such as homecoming and the fall festival. Intramural sports are popular, especially basketball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee. The speech team competes regularly; Audra Casterline, a member of the speech team was named Miss Indiana in 2014.

There are nearly 30 student run clubs and organizations at Marian University. 

Adjacent to campus, though not located on campus property, is Bishop Simon Bruté College Seminary, a college seminary for Catholic seminarians, operated by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Approximately 20-30 young men, who are also Marian students, live at the seminary and receive formation there.

==Athletics==
The Marian athletic teams are called the Knights. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Crossroads League (formerly known as the Mid-Central College Conference (MCCC) until after the 2011–12 school year) for most of its sports since the 1987–88 academic year; while its football team competes in the Mideast League of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA).

Marian competes in 24 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, rugby, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cycling, cheerleading and dance.

The university&#x27;s mascot is Knightro, the Knight. 

===Football===

Marian began a football program in 2007 under head coach Ted Karras Jr. Since then, the Knights have won two NAIA national championships. In 2012, in only their sixth year of play, the Knights won their first NAIA football championship. In 2014, the #7 Marian Knights became the NAIA runner-up after losing to #8 Southern Oregon University 55–31. The next year, the Knights won the NAIA championship, a rematch of the 2014 national championship against the SOU Raiders, 31–14. This marked their third championship game appearance and second victory in four years. The head coach for that victory was Mark Henninger. Several football program alumni have earned contracts at the professional level, such as Krishawn Hogan and Julian Williams.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
The men&#x27;s basketball program, established for the 1954–1955 season, claims to be the oldest intercollegiate athletic team at Marian.

===Cycling===
Marian University is nationally known for its cycling team, which practices and competes at the Indy Cycloplex, home of the Major Taylor Velodrome. The cycling team is a Division I varsity team underneath the collegiate cycling umbrella of USA Cycling.

<doc id="946476" wikidata="Q433224" url="?curid=946476" title="APNG">
<text>Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) is a file format which extends the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification to permit animated images that work similarly to animated GIF files, while supporting 24 or 48-bit images and full alpha transparency not available for GIFs. It also retains backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files.

The first frame of an APNG file is stored as a normal PNG stream, so most standard PNG decoders are able to display the first frame of an APNG file. The frame speed data and extra animation frames are stored in extra chunks (as provided for by the original PNG specification). APNG competed with Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG), a comprehensive format for bitmapped animations which was created by the same team as PNG and is obsolete. APNG&#x27;s advantage was the smaller library size and compatibility with older PNG implementations.

== History and development ==
The APNG specification was created in 2004 by Stuart Parmenter and Vladimir Vukićević of the Mozilla Corporation to allow for storing the animations needed for interfaces such as throbbers. In May 2003, Mozilla had scrapped support for MNG animations, which provides a superset of APNG functionality, citing concerns about the large file size required for the expansive MNG decoder library (300 KB); the APNG decoder, built on the back of the PNG decoder, was a much smaller component.

Among users and maintainers of the PNG and MNG formats, APNG had a lukewarm reception. In particular, PNG was conceived to be a single-image format. APNG hides the subsequent frames in PNG ancillary chunks in such a way that APNG-unaware applications would ignore them, but there are otherwise no changes to the format to allow software to distinguish between animated and non-animated images. Some of the main concerns arising from this were the inability of applications to negotiate for PNG and APNG, or distinguish between PNG and APNG once received, or for legacy software to even inform users that there are additional frames. Glenn Randers-Pehrson spearheaded efforts to reconcile the PNG purists&#x27; position with that of APNG proponents by recommending changes to APNG&#x27;s format and proposing the use of a unique MIME type (e.g., video/png), but the APNG proponents only added the different MIME type (image/apng) while insisting on the use of the &quot;.png&quot; extension instead of &quot;.apng&quot;, leading to the format not being approved by the PNG Development Group.

The PNG Development Group rejected APNG as an official extension on April 20, 2007, and there have been several subsequent proposals for a simple animated graphics format based on PNG using several different approaches. However, since September 14, 2021, the PNG Working Group has been chartered by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to maintain and develop for the PNG specification, and the first public working draft of PNG Specification (Third Edition) was published on October 25, 2022, adding APNG extensions to the core PNG specification. The Candidate Recommendation was published on September 21, 2023.
== File format ==

The APNG specification follows the PNG File format introducing three new ancillary chunks:

* The animation control chunk (acTL) precedes the IDAT(s) of the default image and is a kind of &quot;marker&quot; that this is an animated PNG file. It also contains the number of frames and the number of times to loop the animation (0 meaning infinite).
* The frame control chunk (fcTL) precedes each frame and contains its metadata : dimensions; position (relative to the default image); duration; if once over it is cleared to black, replaced by the previous frame or drawn over by the next frame; and if its transparency applies.
* The frame data chunk (fdAT) storing frame&#x27;s content. It starts with a sequence number, then has the same structure as the default image&#x27;s IDAT chunk(s).

Sequence numbers apply to both frame control and frame data chunks, which together follow a common sequence, thus enabling the order and timing of frames to be recovered should an APNG-unaware PNG editor re-order them as allowed by PNG chunk ordering rules.

Frames utilize the same bit depth, color type, compression method, filter method, interlace method, and palette (if any) as the default image.

An application reading a PNG file is meant to ignore any chunks which it does not understand, making APNG backwards compatible. Applications without support for the APNG extension show only the first frame, disregarding additional animation frames.

=== Compression and optimization ===
A number of optimization techniques make APNG files as small as possible: Inter-frame optimization utilizing alpha-blend and alpha dispose operations, smaller than the full-size subframes, dirty transparency, color type and color palette optimizations, and various compression options: zlib, 7-Zip, Zopfli.

===Derived formats===
Animated stickers for Signal are APNG with some restrictions (the size of the file is limited to 300kb, the length of the animation is limited to 3 seconds and, visibly (this last point is unclear), the resolution must be 512x512px).

== Support ==
Mozilla Firefox added support for APNG in version 3 trunk builds on March 23, 2007. However, because libpng is the PNG Group&#x27;s reference implementation of the official specification, APNG support can never be supported in the main libpng distribution so long as it remains unratified by the Group. Iceweasel 3 supports APNG by using Mozilla&#x27;s unofficial variant of libpng.

In 2008 WorldDMB adopted APNG as a backward compatible extension to enable animation as part of the MOT SlideShow user application for Digital Radio. &quot;APNG 1.0 Specification - Animated Portable Network Graphics&quot; is included as normative Annex A in the ETSI standard TS 101 499 V2.2.1. In 2016, Apple adopted the APNG format as the preferred format for animated stickers in iOS 10 iMessage apps. On March 15, 2017, APNG support was added to Chromium.


A server-side library exists that allows web browsers that support the canvas tag, but do not support APNG, to display APNGs. Examples of such browsers include Microsoft Edge Legacy and Internet Explorer 9.

<doc id="946478" wikidata="Q754317" url="?curid=946478" title="Patriarchal cross">
<text>The Patriarchal cross is a variant of the Christian cross, the religious symbol of Christianity, and is also known as the Cross of Lorraine. Similar to the Latin cross, the patriarchal cross possesses a smaller crossbar placed above the main one so that both crossbars are near the top. Sometimes the patriarchal cross has a short, slanted crosspiece near its foot (Russian Orthodox cross). This slanted, lower crosspiece often appears in Byzantine Greek and Eastern European iconography, as well as in other Eastern Orthodox churches. In most renditions of the Cross of Lorraine, the horizontal bars are &quot;graded&quot; with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen.

== Imagery ==
The top beam represents the plaque bearing the inscription &quot;Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews&quot; (often abbreviated in the Latinate &quot;INRI&quot; and in the Greek as &quot;INBI&quot;).

Many symbolic interpretations of the double-cross have been put forth. One of them says that the first horizontal line symbolized the secular power and the other horizontal line the ecclesiastic power of Byzantine emperors, and also that the first cross bar represents the death, and the second cross the resurrection, of Jesus Christ.

=== Other variations ===

The Russian Orthodox cross can be considered a modified version of the Patriarchal cross, having two smaller crossbeams, one at the top and one near the bottom, in addition to the longer crossbeam. One suggestion is the lower crossbeam represents the footrest () to which the feet of Jesus were nailed. However, there is no evidence of footrests ever being used during the crucifixion, and it has a deeper meaning. The bottom beam may represent a balance of justice. Some sources suggest that as one of the thieves being crucified with Jesus repented of his sin and believed in Jesus as the Messiah and was thus with Christ in Paradise, the other thief rejected and mocked Jesus and therefore descended into Hades. In some earlier representations (and still currently in the Greek Church) the crossbar near the bottom is straight or slanted upwards. In later Slavic and other traditions, it came to be depicted as slanted, with the side to the viewer&#x27;s left usually being higher.

One tradition says that this comes from the idea that as Jesus Christ took his last breath, the bar to which his feet were nailed broke, thus slanting to the side. Another tradition holds that the slanted bar represents the repentant thief and the unrepentant thief that were crucified with Christ, the one to Jesus&#x27; right-hand repenting and rising to be with God in Paradise, and one on his left falling to Hades and separation from God. In this manner, it also reminds the viewer of the Last Judgment. Still another explanation of the slanted crossbar would suggest the Cross Saltire, as tradition holds that the Apostle St. Andrew introduced Christianity to lands north and west of the Black Sea: today&#x27;s Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Moldova, and Romania.

== Byzantine Empire ==
The Patriarchal cross first regularly appeared on the coinage of the Byzantine Empire starting with the second reign of the Emperor Justinian II, whose second reign was from 705–711. At the beginning of the second reign, the Emperor was depicted on the solidus holding a with a Patriarchal cross at the top of the globe. Until then, the standard practice was to show the with an ordinary cross. The Emperor Theodosius III, who ruled from 715 to 717, made the Patriarchal cross a standard feature of the gold, silver and bronze coinage minted in Constantinople. After his short reign ended, the practice was discontinued under his successor, Leo III, due to his iconoclastic views, and was not revived again until the middle of the eighth century by Artavasdus.

==Hungary==
The two-barred cross has been one of the main elements in the coat of arms of Hungary at least since 1190. It appeared during the reign of King Béla III, who was raised in the Byzantine court. He was for a time heir to the throne of the Byzantine Empire and betrothed to the emperor&#x27;s daughter. When the emperor&#x27;s wife gave birth to a son, the emperor dissolved his daughter&#x27;s betrothal to Béla and removed Béla&#x27;s title of despotes. Soon after Béla left Constantinople when he inherited the Hungarian throne in 1172. The cross started appearing floating in the coat of arms and on the coins from this era. During the middle ages, the two-barred cross became associated with the Árpád dynasty and the Kingdom of Hungary along with the Árpád stripes. Even the orb of Hungary has a two-barred cross instead of a simple cross. The symbol found its way to Western Europe through Hungary, because René the Good, who was related to the House Anjou of Hungary, laid claim to four kingdoms, including Hungary. He placed the symbol on his flags before the battle of Nancy. He won the battle and regained his lost Duchy of Lorraine. Thus the symbol became known in Western-Europe as the Cross of Lorraine.

== Lithuania and Belarus ==
Another form of the cross was used by the Jagiellonian dynasty. This cross now features on the coat of arms of Lithuania, where it appears on the shield of the Vytis. It is also the badge of the Lithuanian Air Force and forms the country&#x27;s highest award for bravery, the Order of the Cross of Vytis. The Jagiellonian cross is also used on the coat of arms and flags of every Lithuanian county, yet not following any heraldic rules.

The Patriarchal Cross appears on the Pahonia, used at various times as the coat of arms of Grand Duchy of Lithuania for centuries and of Belarus.

== Russia ==
During 1577–1625 the Russian use of the cross was between the heads of the double-headed eagle in the coat of arms of Russia.

== Slovakia ==

<doc id="946493" wikidata="Q4923643" url="?curid=946493" title="Blackwood railway station, Adelaide">
<text>Blackwood railway station is located on the Belair line in Adelaide. Situated 18 kilometres from Adelaide station, it is in the southern foothills suburb of Blackwood.

==History==
Blackwood station opened in 1883 with the opening of the Adelaide to Aldgate section of the Adelaide-Melbourne line. On 18 June 1928, it became the temporary terminus of the double track section from Eden Hills. On 24 June 1928, it was extended through to Belair. In 1940, a footbridge was added.

Blackwood is one of the busiest stations on the Belair line, and it is the only station on the line to have a bus interchange with connections available with many routes. Also, it and Mitcham are the only stations between Goodwood and Belair to have more than one platform in use to allow services to pass. Blackwood is also the only station where trains mostly use the right platform as opposed to the left. After Blackwood station, between Blackwood and Belair there is no loop to allow more than one train to pass.

In 1995, as part of the One Nation Adelaide-Melbourne line gauge conversion project, a standard gauge line was laid on the eastern side of the station. In 2009, the station was given a facelift.

== Services by platforms ==

==Transport links==
Several bus routes operate from the nearby Blackwood Interchange. The interchange is also served by school bus services, however, these are not accessible to the general public.

<doc id="946495" wikidata="Q284693" url="?curid=946495" title="EZ Publish">
<text>eZ Publish (pronounced &quot;easy publish&quot;) is an open-source enterprise PHP content management system that was developed by the Norwegian company Ibexa. eZ Publish is now maintained by 7x. eZ Publish is freely available under the GNU GPL version 2 license, as well as under proprietary licenses that include commercial support. In 2015, eZ Systems introduced eZ Platform to replace eZ Publish with a more modern and future-proof solution. In 2024, 7x released eZ Publish 6.0 (stable) to replace eZ Publish 5.4 with a more modern and future-proof solution compatible with PHP 7.x and 8.x software. In 2025/02 7x continues to release regular improved releases of eZ Publish 6.0.7 with a brand new subtree copy feature and additional cms kernel based improvements. 

==Areas of use==

eZ Publish supports the development of customized web applications. Typical applications range from brand sites, news sites and intranets to e-commerce, collaboration portals and iOS/Android apps. eZ Publish provides role-based multi-user access, multi-site management and multi-device delivery to desktops, tablets, phones and the Internet of Things (IoT) such as Smart TVs and digital kiosks.

The software is widely used in web applications of varying type and size worldwide.

== Handling ==

eZ Publish is managed via a Web browser, and additional local software is not necessary. It also features a rich-text editor that allows formatting content similar to a word processor. This enables content editing and contribution without HTML skills. Content management can also be done through the eZ Publish front-end.

==Dual-licensing==

The software is provided for free, and may be used and modified according to the GPL license. In addition, paid professional support is available with eZ Publish. Furthermore, a commercial license is also available, granting the right to use eZ Publish under license conditions different from the GPL.

== Functional range ==

The eZ Publish range of features includes professional and secure development of web applications. Functional areas include content versioning, media library, role-based rights management, mobile development, sitemaps, search and printing.

Additionally, the system includes extensions, which contain individual functions. This allows for the upgrading of components while preserving compatibility with customized parts.

== Technology ==

eZ Publish is written in PHP. Certified webservers on *nix systems are Apache and nginx. Some alternatives, such as Lighttpd, Hiawatha, Cherokee, may also work. On Windows, IIS is the preferred webserver. It is very common to use Varnish for caching high-performance sites that use eZ Publish.

The database abstraction layer enables the use of most common databases, i.e. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite without changes to the core system, by using drivers.

The software is cluster-ready and enforces the separation of content and presentation via XML storage of all content.

eZ Publish features:
* User-defined content classes and objects
* Role-based permissions system
* Template engine
* Version control
* Workflow management and task system
* Image conversion and scaling
* Database abstraction layer
* Multi-lingual support, with Unicode
* Libraries for XML, SOAP, localization and internationalization
* Search engine support

== eZ Components ==

eZ Components was a library of standardized modules for speeding up application development. It includes functions for compressing binary files, optimizing performance through caching, connecting to several databases, debugging, RSS, generating graphs for analysis, converting images, supporting email and validating user input.

In an effort to transition the development from a company-driven to a community-driven model, the whole source of the eZ Components were donated to the Apache Software Foundation, relicensed from the BSD to the Apache 2 license and renamed to Zeta Components.

== Replacement with eZ Platform ==
In December 2014 the last version of the software eZ Publish By eZ Systems was released. The work on the code base continued in the form of eZ Platform. This new version is dropping all the legacy code from the software and transitioning to a completely new code base built on the Symfony Full Stack Framework. This allows the developer team to share components and documentation with the underlying framework while adding functionalities such as content and media management. eZ Platform is one of many CMSs using Symfony PHP components.

The initial version of eZ Platform was released on December 15, 2015, and the latest stable version, v2.5, was released in March 2019. The product is a fully functional Open Source CMS. Beyond the open source version of the software, users have also the option to choose eZ Platform Enterprise Edition which is a commercial Digital Experience Platform built on the eZ Platform core.

<doc id="946499" wikidata="Q1533561" url="?curid=946499" title="Gobstopper">
<text>A gobstopper, also known as a jawbreaker in Canada and the United States, is a type of boiled sweet. It is usually round, and usually ranges from across; though gobstoppers billed as having a diameter as large as have been marketed.

The term &quot;gobstopper&quot; derives from &quot;gob&quot;, which is slang in the United Kingdom and Ireland for mouth. The sweet was a favourite among British schoolboys in the first half of the twentieth century; author Roald Dahl, who wrote about a jar of gobstoppers featuring in the prank he played in his local sweet shop in 1924, also referred to them in his fictional Everlasting Gobstopper which was featured in his 1964 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

A gobstopper usually consists of a number of layers, each dissolving to reveal a different colour, and sometimes flavour. A gobstopper is too hard to bite without risking dental damage (hence the name &quot;jawbreaker&quot;).

Gobstoppers have been sold in traditional sweet shops for at least a century, often by weight from jars. As gobstoppers dissolve very slowly, they last a very long time in the mouth, which is a major factor in their popularity.

==Manufacturing==


Gobstoppers are made by slowly depositing layers onto a core, such as a pressed ball of sugar, a single seed of anise or a gumball. Gobstoppers are made in large, rotating, heated pans in a process known as &quot;hot panning&quot;. The sweets take several weeks to manufacture, as the process of adding liquid sugar is repeated multiple times. Natural and artificial colours and flavors are also added during the panning process.

==Everlasting Gobstoppers==

The Everlasting Gobstoppers, sold under Nestlé&#x27;s Willy Wonka Candy Company brand, were first introduced in 1976 by Breaker Confections, and are named after the Everlasting Gobstoppers in Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. In Dahl&#x27;s story, Everlasting Gobstoppers are purported to last forever. Dahl named the sweet after gobstoppers, which were a favourite among British schoolboys between the two World Wars. A jar of gobstoppers featured in the prank Dahl played on the owner of his local sweet shop in 1924, which he recorded in his autobiography &quot;Boy: Tales of Childhood&quot;.

==In popular culture==
===Charlie and the Chocolate Factory===
In the 1964 children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, Roald Dahl described &quot;Everlasting Gobstoppers,&quot; a fictional gobstopper that could never get smaller or be finished.

===Ed, Edd n Eddy===
The animated series &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; revolves around jawbreakers. Most episodes feature the title characters running a variety of scams to earn money to buy the confections. The jawbreakers in the show are depicted as comically oversized, often with a circumference larger than that of the heads of the characters; characters&#x27; cheeks would balloon to the same size when these jawbreakers were placed in their mouths. Jawbreakers are also the main subject of one of the show&#x27;s tie-in video games, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy: Jawbreakers!&quot;

===Jawbreaker===
The 1999 American teen comedy &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; centres around the main characters accidentally killing their friend after gagging her with a jawbreaker.

==Lawsuit==

In 2003, Taquandra Diggs, a nine-year-old girl in Starke, Florida, US suffered severe burns, allegedly from biting on an exploding Wonka Everlasting Gobstopper that had been refrigerated, left out in the sun, then refrigerated again. Diggs and several other alleged victims&#x27; families filed lawsuits against Nestlé for medical bills resulting from plastic surgery as well as pain and suffering; the matters were later settled outside of court for an undisclosed amount.

<doc id="946500" wikidata="Q1211660" url="?curid=946500" title="The Blind Owl">
<text>The Blind Owl (1936; , &quot;Boof-e koor&quot;, ) is Sadegh Hedayat&#x27;s magnum opus and a major literary work of 20th-century Iran. Written in Persian, it is narrated by an unnamed pen case painter, who addresses his murderous confessions to a shadow on his wall that resembles an owl. His confessions do not follow a linear progression of events and often repeat and layer themselves thematically, thus lending to the open-ended nature of interpretation of the story.

==Background==

&quot;The Blind Owl&quot; was written during the latter years of the rule of Reza Shah. It is believed that much of the novel had already been completed by 1930 while Hedayat was still a student in Paris. Hedayat was inspired by European literature and ideas, and challenged many traditional Iran conventions in the novel, a quality that has often marked him as the father of modernist Persian literature. 

==Plot==

The novel tells the story of an unnamed pen case painter, who, while in despair after losing a mysterious lover, addresses his morbid confessions to a shadow on his wall that looks like an owl. He sees in his macabre, feverish nightmares that &quot;the presence of death annihilates all that is imaginary&quot;. Death hangs over the narrator, who claims that &quot;[w]e are the offspring of death and death delivers us from the tantalizing, fraudulent attractions of life&quot; and that, &quot;[t]hroughout our lives, the finger of death points at us.&quot; The novel is in two parts. The first is a surrealist, dreamlike narrative of the opium-addicted narrator, the woman he both loves and loathes, and a cackling, turban-wearing old man. The second part retells that story in a more realistic tone, and includes details that appear to contradict the first part.

==Translations==
&quot;The Blind Owl&quot; was first translated into French by Roger Lescot during World War II, and published as &quot;La Chouette Aveugle&quot; (1953), and later by Pasteur Vallery Radot, a member of the French Academy. The book was well received in the French literary circles. &quot;The Blind Owl&quot; was translated into English by D. P. Costello (1957), by Iraj Bashiri (1974, revised in 1984 and again in 2013), by Naveed Noori (2011) and by Sassan Tabatabai (2022). It has subsequently been translated into many other languages. In 2023 a book was published in Tehran by Deed (Sight) press titled &quot;Around the World in Eighty Five Years&quot; by Jahangir Hedayat and Farzad Shahrusvand, young translator of &quot;The Blind Owl&quot;, in which they described exactly the whole presses of translations of the novella in 50 languages and also a lot of information about books, films, plays and paintings created under influence of the Blind Owl all over the world.

==Film==
The novel was made into a film in 1974, directed by Kioumars Derambakhsh, starring Parviz Fanizadeh, Farshid Farshood and Parvin Solaymani.

It was also very loosely adapted into the 1987 film &quot;The Blind Owl&quot; directed by Raúl Ruiz.

It was adapted into a 2018 feature film, &quot;The Blind Owl: Boofe Koor&quot; by Iranian-Canadian Mazdak Taebi.

<doc id="946501" wikidata="Q4881877" url="?curid=946501" title="Belair railway station">
<text>Belair railway station is located on the Adelaide to Melbourne line in the Adelaide southern foothills suburb of Belair, 21.5 kilometres from Adelaide station. It is the terminus for Adelaide Metro&#x27;s Belair line service.

==History==
Belair station opened in 1883 with the opening of the Adelaide to Aldgate section of the Adelaide-Melbourne line. Belair is a scenic location on the edge of the Belair National Park and the station has a number of historic preserved buildings. In past years, many people travelled by train to Belair at weekends to enjoy the adjacent National Park. The large 1890s vintage wooden shelter on the main platform was built for these crowds. There were other facilities at the station such as a refreshment room, now long gone. Parts of the heritage station were destroyed by an arsonist in May 2003. The building is currently being rebuilt with special materials. There are also a number of stabling sidings for storing passenger trains overnight.(Used for peak hours terminating trains)

Until 1987, the Bridgewater line carried suburban trains further into the Adelaide Hills as far as the town of Bridgewater. The Bridgewater trains were withdrawn in 1987, attributed to the high cost of operation and low passenger numbers. Platform 2 was used to terminate some suburban trains for a while after the closure of the line. Stations beyond Belair were closed and all suburban trains now terminate at platform 1 at Belair. That being said, there are plans to reopen this again. In 1995, the Adelaide to Melbourne line was converted to standard gauge. This prevented any restoration of local trains to Bridgewater or beyond. Between Goodwood and Belair, the former double track route became two parallel single lines, one broad gauge for Adelaide Metro services, and the former Adelaide bound track was converted to standard gauge for interstate freight.
