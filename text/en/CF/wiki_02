<text>The marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) is a lungfish of the family Protopteridae. Also known as the leopard lungfish, it is found in Eastern and Central Africa, as well as the Nile region. At 133 billion base pairs, it has the largest known genome of any animal and one of the largest of any organism, along with the flowering plant &quot;Paris japonica&quot;, the fern &quot;Tmesipteris oblanceolata&quot; and the protist &quot;Polychaos dubium&quot; at 150 billion, 160 billion and 670 billion, respectively.

The marbled lungfish is caught in large numbers throughout much of its range, including several hundred metric tonnes per year in Mwanza Region&#x27;s Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria alone. It is mostly a food fish, although this varies depending on the exact community, with some recognizing it as a delicacy and others strongly disliking its taste or considering it as a taboo to eat it. In some regions, parts of this fish are used as traditional medicine.

==Description==
The marbled lungfish is smooth, elongated, and cylindrical with deeply embedded scales. The tail is very long and has tapers at the end. They can reach a length of up to . The pectoral and pelvic fins are also very long and thin, almost spaghetti-like, used for gliding through the water. The newly hatched young have branched external gills much like those of newts. After two to three months, the young metamorphose into the adult form, losing their external gills for gill openings. These fish have a yellowish gray or pinkish-toned ground color with dark slate-gray splotches, creating a marbling or leopard effect over their bodies and fins. The color pattern is darker along the top and lighter below. It was once believed that marbled lungfish are obligate air breathers, however, research published in 2007 suggests that the marbled lungfish primarily relies on aquatic respiration unless restricted by certain ecological or physiological conditions.

==Distribution==
&quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot; is found in the African countries of Angola, Burundi, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Among others, it lives in the Nile and Congo River basins, including lakes such as Albert, Edward, Tanganyika, Victoria, Nabugabo, Turkana, No and Kyoga. Different subspecies are found in different areas: &quot;P. a. aethiopicus&quot; lives in the Nile basin and its lakes like Victoria and Tanganyika, &quot;P. a. congicus&quot; in the middle and upper Congo River, and &quot;P. a. mesmaekersi&quot; in the lower Congo.

== Habitat ==
Adult marbled lungfish live in swamps, riverbeds, floodplains, and river deltas throughout its range. The juvenile members of the species often live in between the roots of papyrus plants. Despite being aquatic, adult marbled lungfish can live in riverbeds and other areas that have no rain for portions of the year due to their ability to estivate or burrow in the ground to form an air bubble and breathe out of a hole in the cocoon thus formed.

== Reproduction ==
Breeding generally occurs during flood season, during which time males prepare a pit nest. One or more females may use the same pit nest, into which they lay their eggs. The female(s) then leaves the nest and the male guards the nest from attack for the next 8 weeks; in addition, he regularly fills the nest with air to ensure that the newly-laid eggs survive. Research experiments conducted on marbled lungfish in Lake Baringo, Kenya, Africa reveal that the marbled lungfish actually reproduce regularly throughout the year as observed by the presence of lungfish in all maturity stages in all monthly samples. Additionally, based on the growth trajectories from R. Dunbarck&#x27;s experiments suggests that overall, the marbled lungfish have a low reproductive effort and reach maturity around the age of 3 years.

== Diet ==
The diet of adults consists largely of mollusks, such as &quot;Mutela&quot; &quot;bourguignati.&quot; They also eat small fish and insects at times; the diet of juveniles consists almost entirely of insects.

<text>Linnea Eleanor &quot;Bunny&quot; Yeager (March 13, 1929 – May 25, 2014) was an American photographer, pin-up model, actress and author.

==Early life and career==
Linnea Eleanor Yeager was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to Raymond Conrad and Linnea (née Sherlin) Yeager on March 13, 1929. Her family moved to Florida when she was 17. She adopted the nickname &quot;Bunny&quot; from Lana Turner&#x27;s character Bunny Smith in the 1945 movie &quot;Week-End at the Waldorf&quot;. The nickname has also been attributed to her portrayal of the Easter Bunny in a high school play.

She graduated from Miami Edison High School and afterwards enrolled at the Coronet Modeling School and Agency. She won numerous local beauty pageants including in rapid succession Queen of Miami, Florida Orchid Queen, Miss Trailercoach of Dade County, Miss Army &amp; Air Force, Miss Personality of Miami Beach, Queen of the Sports Carnival and Cheesecake Queen of 1951. Yeager became one of the most photographed models in Miami. Photos of Yeager appeared in over 300 newspapers and magazines.

Yeager also designed and sewed many of the outfits she and her models wore, at one time boasting that she never wore the same outfit twice while modeling. She designed and produced hundreds of bikinis when the two-piece swimsuit was a new fashion item and is credited with its popularity in America. Bruno Banani, the German fashion company, has developed a line of swimwear based on Yeager&#x27;s designs from the 1950s.

Yeager entered photography to save money by copying her modeling photographs, enrolling in a night class at a vocational school in 1953. Her career as a professional photographer began when a picture of Maria Stinger, taken for her first school assignment, was sold to &quot;Eye&quot; magazine for the cover of the March 1954 issue. She became a technically skilled photographer noted for, among other things, her early use of the fill flash technique to lighten dark shadows when shooting in bright sun. Yeager was one of the first photographers to photograph her models outdoors with natural light. Matt Schudel wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that her images were vivid and dynamic, going on to say, &quot;She favored active poses and a direct gaze at the camera lens, in what could be interpreted alternately as playful innocence or pure lust.&quot;

She met Bettie Page in 1954, and took most of the photographs of her that year. During their brief collaboration she took over 1,000 pictures of Page. Along with photographer Irving Klaw, Yeager played a role in helping to make Page famous, particularly with her photos in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. &quot;American Photo&quot; magazine described Yeager&#x27;s work with Page as &quot;a body of imagery that remains some of the most memorable — and endearing — erotica on record&quot; in a 1993 article. The most famous images of Page by Yeager include the January 1955 &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfold in which she kneels wearing only a Santa hat while hanging a silver ornament on a Christmas tree and a series of photographs with a pair of live cheetahs.

Yeager was a very prolific and successful pinup photographer in the 1950s and 1960s, so much so, that her work was described as ubiquitous in that era. She continued to work extensively with &quot;Playboy&quot; shooting eight centerfolds in addition to covers and pictorial spreads. She discovered Lisa Winters, the first Playmate of the Year. Yeager also appeared in the magazine as a model five times. One appearance with the headline, &quot;Queen of the Playboy Centerfolds&quot;, was photographed by Hugh Hefner.

Her work was also published in mainstream magazines including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Pageant&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot; and &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;. The famous still images she took of Ursula Andress emerging from the water on the beach in Jamaica for the 1962 James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot; are probably her best known bikini photographs. She discovered many notable models. In the 1970s as men&#x27;s magazines became more anatomically graphic Yeager largely stopped photographing for them, saying they were somewhat &quot;smutty&quot; and that, &quot;They had girls showing more than they should.&quot; In 1998 she stated, &quot;The kind of photographs they wanted was something I wasn&#x27;t prepared to do.&quot;

==Later career==
An exhibition titled &quot;Beach Babes Bash&quot; in the early 1990s at the Center for Visual Communication (at that time located in Coral Gables, Florida) featured photographs by Yeager of models from Miami on the beach from the 1950s. Another exhibit at the same gallery featuring Yeager&#x27;s work was titled &quot;Sex Sirens of the Sixties.&quot; In 1992 &quot;Playboy&quot; published a retrospective of her work titled &quot;The Bettie Boom&quot;. Since 2002, Yeager&#x27;s work has been exhibited in contemporary art galleries.

In early 2010, The Andy Warhol Museum held the first major museum exhibition of Yeager&#x27;s work. The exhibit, &quot;The Legendary Queen of the Pin Up&quot;, featured her self-portraits, some from her book &quot;How I Photograph Myself&quot; published by A.S. Barnes &amp; Co. in 1964. &quot;The Fabulous Bunny Yeager&quot; an exhibit in 2011 at the Harold Golen Gallery in Miami also featuring self-portraits by Yeager was of photographs that had not been exhibited previously. Also in 2011 Helmut Schuster curated an exhibition for Art Basel at the Dezer Schauhalle in Miami titled &quot;Bunny Yeager: Retrospective to the Future&quot; featuring over 200 of Yeager&#x27;s photos. Included were some images that had not been shown before of models including Bettie Page.

In 2012 Bunny Yeager had two exhibitions in Germany, &quot;Funland&quot; at Gallery Schuster Potsdam and &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; in December 2012 at Gallery Schuster Berlin.

The Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale held a 2013 exhibit, &quot;Bunny Yeager: Both Sides of the Camera&quot; featuring her photographs of herself, Page, and model Paz de la Huerta. The exhibit also included some of Yeager&#x27;s first new pictures in twenty years. Yeager had a show at the Sofia Vault in Sofia, Bulgaria in October 2013. The Gavlak Gallery in Palm Beach, Florida put on an exhibit, &quot;Bunny Yeager: Selections from &quot;How I Photograph Myself&quot;&quot; in 2014. The Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas held a posthumous exhibit, &quot;Bunny&#x27;s Bombshells&quot;, from June 5 to .

She had her own studio in the Wynwood Art District of Miami, part of the Center for Visual Communication. There is a &quot;Bunny Yeager Lounge&quot; in Berlin which is open to the public and shows photos, memorabilia and movies. Yeager was also founding editor and publisher of a trade magazine for entertainment professionals, &quot;Florida Stage &amp; Screen&quot;. her 24 books had sold over 1 million copies.

==Personal life and death==
Bunny Yeager was married twice, first to Arthur Irwin who died in 1977 and then to Harry Schaefer who died in 2000. She had two daughters, Lisa and Cherilu.

Yeager died on May 25, 2014, of congestive heart failure at age 85 in North Miami, Florida.

==Legacy==
Yeager&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; called her &quot;one of the country’s most famous and influential photographers.&quot; She has been cited as influencing many artists and photographers including Diane Arbus, Cindy Sherman and Yasumasa Morimura. Arbus called her, &quot;the world’s greatest pinup photographer.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Margalit Fox wrote, &quot;She is widely credited with helping turn the erotic pinup — long a murky enterprise in every sense of the word — into high photographic art.&quot; Her obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; titled, &quot;Bunny Yeager: Pin-up who moved behind the camera to take influential, iconic shots of Bettie Page and Ursula Andress&quot; called her photographic technique pioneering and influential. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported she &quot;helped define [the] art of erotic photography.&quot;

Yeager is credited with helping to popularize the bikini in America. The inspiration for the term &quot;cheesecake&quot; in reference to scantily clad women has been attributed to Yeager. Her books, including &quot;Photographing the Female Figure&quot; which sold over 300,000 copies, have influenced several generations of photographers.

==Media appearances and depictions==
On July 14, 1957, Yeager appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, stumping the panel. She was also on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. She was a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1966 to discuss her book, &quot;How I Photograph Myself&quot;. In 1968 she played the role of a Swedish masseuse opposite Frank Sinatra in &quot;Lady In Cement&quot;. She had bit parts in over half a dozen films including &quot;Tony Rome&quot;, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Dogs of War&quot;, &quot;Absence of Malice&quot;, &quot;Harry &amp; Son&quot; and &quot;The Mean Season&quot;. Yeager also had small roles in a number of television series including &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and made occasional appearances singing in Miami nightclubs.

Yeager was played by Sarah Paulson in the 2005 film &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;. She was also featured on a 2006 CNN story about the 60th anniversary of the bikini. In 2005, Cult Epics released the DVD &quot;100 Girls by Bunny Yeager&quot;, a documentary with behind-the-scenes footage on Yeager&#x27;s photo sessions with Page and other pin-up models.

<text>Thomas Davidson (17 May 181714 October 1885) was a British palaeontologist.

==Biography==
He was born in Edinburgh. His parents possessed considerable landed property in Midlothian. Educated partly in the University of Edinburgh and partly in France, Italy and Switzerland, and early acquiring an interest in natural history, he benefited greatly by acquaintance with foreign languages and literature, and with men of science in different countries.

He was induced in 1837, through the influence of Leopold von Buch, to devote his special attention to the brachiopoda, and in course of time he became the highest authority on this group. The great task of his life was the &quot;Monograph of British Fossil Brachiopoda&quot;, published by the Palaeontographical Society (1850–1886). This work, with supplements, comprises six quarto volumes with more than 200 plates drawn on stone by the author.
He also prepared an exhaustive memoir on &quot;Recent Brachiopoda&quot;, published by the Linnean Society. He monographed the entire series of Brachiopoda collected by HMS Challenger.

Davidson benefited from an introduction to Elizabeth Gray by John Young in 1865. Gray had a lifelong interest in the fossils of Girvan in Scotland. Her family took their holidays there each year and they would devote their time to gathering cleaning and labelling fossils. Gray had some basic geology training, but she preferred to let others do the scientific descriptions. Gray would send collections of fossils, including brachiopoda, regularly over several years between 1867 and 1885. Davidson also worked closely with British paleontologist Agnes Crane, who completed the editing work on Davidson&#x27;s final, posthumous, &quot;Monograph of Recent Brachiopoda&quot;.

He was elected fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1852 and in 1865 awarded their Wollaston medal. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1857, and in 1870 received a Royal medal from the Royal Society. In 1882, the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by the University of St Andrews. In 1866, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Davidson died at Brighton on 14 October 1885, bequeathing his fine collection of recent and fossil brachiopoda to the British Museum. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Twineham. (His son, William Davidson, had inherited Hickstead Place and the Manor of Twineham through his wife, the daughter of John Wood, of Hickstead Place.)

<doc id="937345" wikidata="Q6152851" url="?curid=937345" title="Jane Tranter">
<text>Pauline Jane Tranter (born 17 March 1963) is an English television executive who was the executive vice-president of programming and production at BBC Worldwide&#x27;s Los Angeles base from 2009 until 2015. From 2006 to 2008, she was the BBC&#x27;s controller of fiction; in this capacity she oversaw the corporation&#x27;s output in drama and comedy, as well as films and programmes acquired from overseas, across all BBC TV channels. Critics were concerned that the BBC had invested too much creative power in one person, and following Tranter&#x27;s move to the United States, the position of controller of fiction was abolished and the responsibilities divided up among four other executives.

== Early career ==
After studying English Literature at King&#x27;s College London and taking a secretarial course back in Oxford, she joined the staff of the BBC in 1985, initially working as a secretary in the radio drama department. Two years later, she made the switch into television, working as a floor manager on dramas such as &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Bergerac&quot;.

Later that same year she was promoted to assistant script editor, working on the BBC&#x27;s popular medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;. She quickly caught the eye of producer David M. Thompson, who promoted her to act as script editor on the anthology drama series &quot;Screen One&quot; and &quot;Screen Two&quot;, essentially the same programme whose title changed depending on whether it was being screened on BBC One or BBC Two, with the transmission channel varying depending on content and tone of the dramas produced.

In 1992, she left the staff of the BBC to take up a position as a drama script editor at Carlton Television, working for Tracy Hofman, the controller of drama. Carlton had won the ITV network franchise for broadcasting in London on weekdays, and planned to produce dramas for national consumption across the entire network. At Carlton, Tranter oversaw the Timothy Spall comedy-drama &quot;Frank Stubbs Promotes&quot; and the Victorian-era medical drama &quot;Bramwell&quot;, both of which were hits for ITV.

She returned to the BBC in 1997, initially as an executive producer in the Film &amp; Single Drama department and in 1999 she became Head of Drama Serials. In these roles she commissioned and oversaw a range of dramas made or co-produced by the BBC&#x27;s own drama department, from playwright Arthur Smith&#x27;s football-based comedy-drama &quot;My Summer With Des&quot; (1998) to gritty contemporary dramas such as &quot;Warriors&quot; (1999, starring Matthew Macfadyen) and traditional BBC literary adaptations in the vein of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (also 1999).

== BBC executive ==
In 2000, she was promoted to Controller of Drama Commissioning at the BBC, where she was ultimately responsible for overseeing the corporation&#x27;s entire drama output across all channels, from the in-house departments and independent companies, in series, serials and one-offs. During her tenure in charge of the drama department, the BBC screened ratings-grabbing popular dramas such as &quot;Spooks&quot; (BBC One, 2002–2011) and &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; (BBC One, 2000–2011), as well as award-winning productions such as Paul Abbott&#x27;s &quot;State of Play&quot; (2003) and the adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Bleak House&quot; (2005). She also oversaw the transformation of popular dramas &quot;Casualty&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Holby City&quot; into year-round dramas, the addition of a fourth weekly episode to soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and the highly successful resurrection of classic science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005.

In 2003, she was responsible for a programming budget in the region of £324 million, and in 2002 alone was ultimately responsible for 473 hours of television.

In September 2006, Tranter was promoted to the newly created Head of Fiction position at the BBC. This made her responsible not only for drama, but for comedy, films and acquired programmes from overseas. In this new position, Tranter had an almost unprecedented amount of control over scripted drama on the BBC.

== BBC Worldwide ==
Throughout 2008, there was media speculation that Tranter would be leaving the BBC to take up a position as head of BBC Worldwide&#x27;s American arm. Despite denying the claims at a Royal Television Society event in June, her new role in the US was confirmed in September. She began her new job as executive vice-president of programming and production at BBC Worldwide&#x27;s Los Angeles base on 1 January 2009. The BBC had been criticised for consolidating the control of fiction commissioning in one person; following Tranter&#x27;s resignation, the responsibilities were split between four BBC executives.

==Bad Wolf==
In the summer of 2015, Tranter set up a production company with Julie Gardner based in Cardiff, Wales and Los Angeles, California. The company was named Bad Wolf in homage to a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; storyline. Bad Wolf&#x27;s first production, &quot;The Night Of&quot;, was nominated for thirteen Emmys in 2017, of which it won five. The company has since gone on to produce shows like &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; and &quot;A Discovery of Witches&quot;. She, along with Julie Gardner, returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; when Russell T Davies returned as showrunner in 2023, with Bad Wolf taking over the series production. 

Tranter continues to work as a producer outside of Bad Wolf. She was an executive producer on the HBO hit &quot;Succession&quot;, which was awarded a Peabody in 2019. In 2020, &quot;Succession&quot; received both a Golden Globe and an Emmy - Best Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series respectively.

In 2021, &quot;Radio Times&quot; listed Tranter at No. 16 in their TV 100 list for 2020.

<text>Beaudesert is a rural town and locality in the Scenic Rim Region of Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Beaudesert had a population of 6,752 people.

Beaudesert is the administrative centre for the Scenic Rim Region. 

== Geography ==
Beaudesert is south of Brisbane and west of the Gold Coast.

Beaudesert is located on the Mount Lindesay Highway, some south of Brisbane. The area sources its income predominantly from rural activities such as cropping, grazing and equine activities, as well as tourism. 
In the Logan River and Albert River valleys, Beaudesert is a regional hub serving surrounding communities such as Rathdowney, Kooralbyn, Canungra, Tamborine Mountain and Jimboomba. It is approximately 91 kilometres from Brisbane and connected by the Mount Lindesay Highway.

The town of Beaudesert is located above sea level and has an average annual rainfall of around per year. The temperature is around in summer and falls to around in winter. Generally the weather is mild, but some severe storms can arrive each summer.

In the east of the locality is the decommissioned Nindooinbah Dam. The much larger Wyaralong Dam is situated roughly to the north west of the town and was completed in 2011.

=== Climate ===
Beaudesert experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), with hot, wet summers and mild, dry winters.
== History ==
Yugembah (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages in areas that include the Beaudesert, Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Albert River, Beenleigh, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama, Tamborine and Tweed River Valley, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley.

Mununjali (also known as Mananjahli, Manaldjahli and Manandjali) is a dialect of the Yugambeh language. The Mununjali language area includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Scenic Rim and Beaudesert Shire Councils.

The town is possibly named after Beau Desert Park, the property of Charles Henry Alexander Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey in Staffordshire, England. Yet it is certain that Queensland&#x27;s Beaudesert was named in about 1841 or 1842 by &#x27;Ned Hawkins&#x27;, or Edward Brace Hawkins (1821–1849), who was claiming the area as a sheep station on behalf of his employer William Henry Suttor senior (1805–1877) at Bathurst. It is not known why Hawkins picked the name Beaudesert. He was himself born in Newark-Upon-Trent in Nottinghamshire, the son of Thomas Fitzherbert Hawkins and wife Elizabeth of Bathurst fame, and it does not seem that he or his family had any personal connections to Beaudesert in England. Ned Hawkins moved on, not long after taking up Beaudesert station, to take up Boonara Station in the South Burnett.

The town was settled in 1847, on Yugambeh lands, and in 1850 the Nindooinbah Homestead was built.
The town was originally set out in a grid pattern; however, several of the streets followed cart tracks. The area was originally settled for growing cotton and sheep. However, the area is also notoriously short of water and the cotton was not a successful crop. Hoop pine was very successfully collected from the area.

<text>A double bind is a dilemma in communication in which an individual (or group) receives two or more mutually conflicting messages. In some scenarios (e.g. within families or romantic relationships) this can be emotionally distressing, creating a situation in which a successful response to one message results in a failed response to the other (and vice versa), such that the person responding will automatically be perceived as in the wrong, no matter how they respond. This double bind prevents the person from either resolving the underlying dilemma or opting out of the situation.

Double bind theory was first stated by Gregory Bateson and his colleagues in the 1950s, in a theory on the origins of schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Double binds are often utilized as a form of control without open coercion—the use of confusion makes them difficult both to respond to and to resist.

A double bind generally includes different levels of abstraction in the order of messages and these messages can either be stated explicitly or implicitly within the context of the situation, or they can be conveyed by tone of voice or body language. Further complications arise when frequent double binds are part of an ongoing relationship to which the person or group is committed.

==Explanation==
The double bind is often misunderstood to be a simple contradictory situation, where the subject is trapped by two conflicting demands. While it is true that the core of the double bind is two conflicting demands, the difference lies in how they are imposed upon the subject, what the subject&#x27;s understanding of the situation is, and who (or what) imposes these demands upon the subject. Unlike the usual no-win situation, the subject has difficulty in defining the exact nature of the paradoxical situation in which they are caught. The contradiction may be unexpressed in its immediate context and therefore invisible to external observers, only becoming evident when a prior communication is considered. Typically, a demand is imposed upon the subject by someone whom they respect (such as a parent, teacher, or doctor) but the demand itself is inherently impossible to fulfill because some broader context forbids it. For example, this situation arises when a person in a position of authority imposes two contradictory conditions but there exists an unspoken rule that one must never question authority.

Gregory Bateson and his colleagues defined the double bind as follows (paraphrased):
Thus, the essence of a double bind is two conflicting demands, &quot;each on a different logical level&quot;, neither of which can be ignored or escaped. This leaves the subject torn both ways, so that whichever demand they try to meet, the other demand cannot be met. &quot;I must do it, but I can&#x27;t do it&quot; is a typical description of the double-bind experience.

For a double bind to be effective, the subject must be unable to confront or resolve the conflict between the demand placed by the primary injunction and that of the secondary injunction. In this sense, the double bind differentiates itself from a simple contradiction to a more inexpressible internal conflict, where the subject really &quot;wants&quot; to meet the demands of the primary injunction, but fails each time through an inability to address the situation&#x27;s incompatibility with the demands of the secondary injunction. Thus, subjects may express feelings of extreme anxiety in such a situation, as they attempt to fulfill the demands of the primary injunction albeit with obvious contradictions in their actions.

This was a problem in United States legal circles prior to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution being applied to state action. A person could be subpoenaed to testify in a federal case and given Fifth Amendment immunity for testimony in that case. However, since the immunity did not apply to a state prosecution, the person could refuse to testify at the Federal level despite being given immunity, thus subjecting the person to imprisonment for contempt of court, or the person could testify, and the information they were forced to give in the Federal proceeding could then be used to convict the person in a state proceeding.

==History==
The term &quot;double bind&quot; was first used by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson and his colleagues (including Don D. Jackson, Jay Haley and John H. Weakland) in the mid-1950s in their discussions on complexity of communication in relation to schizophrenia. Bateson made clear that such complexities are common in normal circumstances, especially in &quot;play, humour, poetry, ritual and fiction&quot; (see Logical Types below). Their findings indicated that the tangles in communication often diagnosed as schizophrenia are not necessarily the result of an organic brain dysfunction. Instead, they found that destructive double binds were a frequent pattern of communication among families of patients, and they proposed that growing up amidst perpetual double binds could lead to learned patterns of confusion in thinking and communication.

Double bind communication has since been described by Mark L. Ruffalo as occurring within the context of personality pathology, specifically borderline personality disorder. He has hypothesized that patients with BPD engage in double bind communication as a result of their characteristic need-fear dilemma, a simultaneous need for and fear of closeness with other persons.

==Complexity in communication==
Human communication is complex, and context is an essential part of it. Communication consists of the words said, tone of voice, and body language. It also includes how these relate to what has been said in the past; what is not said, but is implied; how these are modified by other nonverbal cues, such as the environment in which it is said, and so forth. For example, if someone says &quot;I love you&quot;, one takes into account who is saying it, their tone of voice and body language, and the context in which it is said. It may be a declaration of passion or a serene reaffirmation, insincere and/or manipulative, an implied demand for a response, a joke, its public or private context may affect its meaning, and so forth.

Conflicts in communication are common and often individuals ask &quot;What do you mean?&quot; or seek clarification in other ways. This is called &quot;meta-communication:&quot; communication about the communication. Sometimes, asking for clarification is impossible. Communication difficulties in ordinary life often occur when meta-communication and feedback systems are lacking or inadequate or there is not enough time for clarification.
Double binds can be extremely stressful and become destructive when one is trapped in a dilemma and punished for finding a way out; however, making the effort to find the way out of the trap can lead to emotional growth.

==Examples==
The classic example given of a negative double bind is of a parent telling their child they love them, while at the same time turning away in disgust, or inflicting corporal punishment as discipline: the words are socially acceptable; the body language is in conflict with it. The child does not know how to respond to the conflict between the words and the body language and, because the child is dependent on the parent for basic needs, they are in a quandary. Small children have difficulty articulating contradictions verbally and can neither ignore them nor leave the relationship.

Another example is when one is commanded to &quot;be spontaneous&quot;. The very command contradicts spontaneity, but it only becomes a double bind when one can neither ignore the command nor comment on the contradiction. Often, the contradiction in communication is not apparent to bystanders unfamiliar with previous communications.

===Phrase examples===

* An example from Gerald M. Weinberg in a non-family situation: &quot;I suggest you find someone who you feel is more capable in this role&quot;. This requires the recipient to either confirm that the current incumbent in the role is sufficiently capable, or accept that they choose someone else based on their feelings – not an objective assessment of whether the incumbent is capable. 
*Adult telling their child: &quot;You must love me&quot;. The primary injunction here is the command itself: &quot;you must&quot;; the secondary injunction is the unspoken reality that love is spontaneous, that for the child to love the parent genuinely, it can only be of their own accord.
* Child-abuser to child: &quot;You should have escaped from me earlier, now it&#x27;s too late—because now, nobody will believe that you didn&#x27;t want what I have done&quot;, while at the same time blocking all of the child&#x27;s attempts to escape.Child-abusers often start the double-bind relationship by &quot;grooming&quot; the child, giving little concessions, or gifts or privileges to them, thus the primary injunction is: &quot;You should like what you are getting from me!&quot; When the child begins to go along (i.e. begins to like what they are receiving from the person), then the interaction goes to the next level and small victimization occurs, with the secondary injunction being: &quot;I am punishing you! (for whatever reason the child-abuser is coming up with, e.g. &quot;because you were bad/naughty/messy&quot;, or &quot;because you deserve it&quot;, or &quot;because you made me do it&quot;, etc.).If child shows any resistance (or tries to escape) from the abuser, then the words: &quot;You should have escaped from me earlier [...]&quot; serve as the third level or tertiary injunction. The loop then starts to feed on itself, allowing for ever worse victimization to occur.
* Parent to child: &quot;Leave your sibling alone!&quot;, while the child knows their sibling will approach and antagonize them to get them into trouble. The primary injunction is the command, which they will be punished for breaking. The secondary injunction is the knowledge the sibling will get into conflict with them, but the parent will not know the difference and will default to punishment. The child may be under the impression if they argue with their parent, they may be punished.

== Positive double binds ==

Bateson also described positive double binds, both in relation to Zen Buddhism with its path of spiritual growth, and the use of therapeutic double binds by psychiatrists to confront their patients with the contradictions in their life in such a way that would help them heal. One of Bateson&#x27;s consultants, Milton H. Erickson (5 volumes, edited by Rossi) eloquently demonstrated the productive possibilities of double binds through his own life, showing the technique in a brighter light.

== Science ==

One of the causes of double binds is the loss of feedback systems. Gregory Bateson and Lawrence S. Bale describe double binds that have arisen in science that have caused decades-long delays of progress in science because the scientific community had defined something as outside of its scope (or as &quot;not science&quot;)—see Bateson in his &quot;Introduction&quot; to Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972, 2000), pp. xv–xxvi; and Bale in his article, &quot;Gregory Bateson, Cybernetics and the Social/Behavioral Sciences&quot; (esp. pp. 1–8) on the paradigm of classical science vs. that of systems theory/cybernetics. (See also Bateson&#x27;s description in his &quot;Forward&quot; of how the double bind hypothesis fell into place).

== Work by Bateson ==

=== Schizophrenia ===

The Double Bind Theory was first articulated in relationship to schizophrenia when Bateson and his colleagues hypothesized that schizophrenic thinking was not necessarily an inborn mental disorder but a pattern of learned helplessness in response to cognitive double-binds externally imposed.

It is helpful to remember the context in which these ideas were developed. Bateson and his colleagues were working in the Veteran&#x27;s Administration Hospital (1949–1962) with World War II veterans. As soldiers they&#x27;d been able to function well in combat, but the effects of life-threatening stress had affected them. At that time, 18 years before Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder was officially recognized, the veterans had been saddled with the catch-all diagnosis of schizophrenia. Bateson didn&#x27;t challenge the diagnosis but he did maintain that the seeming nonsense the patients said at times did make sense within context, and he gives numerous examples in section III of &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot;, &quot;Pathology in Relationship&quot;. Bateson also surmised that people habitually caught in double binds in childhood would have greater problems—that in the case of the person with schizophrenia, the double bind is presented continually and habitually within the family context from infancy on. By the time the child is old enough to have identified the double bind situation, it has already been internalized, and the child is unable to confront it. The solution then is to create an escape from the conflicting logical demands of the double bind, in the world of the delusional system (see in &quot;Towards a Theory of Schizophrenia – Illustrations from Clinical Data&quot;).

One solution to a double bind is to place the problem in a larger context, a state Bateson identified as Learning III, a step up from Learning II (which requires only learned responses to reward/consequence situations). In Learning III, the double bind is contextualized and understood as an impossible no-win scenario so that ways around it can be found.

Bateson&#x27;s double bind theory has not yet been followed up with any known published research, as to whether family systems imposing systematic double binds might be a cause of schizophrenia. The current understanding of schizophrenia emphasizes the robust scientific evidence for a genetic predisposition to the disorder. Psychosocial stressors, including dysfunctional family interaction, are secondary causative factors in some instances.

=== Evolution ===

After many years of research into schizophrenia, Bateson continued to explore problems of communication and learning, first with dolphins, and then with the more abstract processes of evolution. Bateson emphasized that any communicative system characterized by different logical levels might be subject to double bind problems. Especially including the communication of characteristics from one generation to another (genetics and evolution).

&quot;...evolution always followed the pathways of viability. As Lewis Carroll has pointed out, the theory [of natural selection] explains quite satisfactorily why there are no bread-and-butter-flies today.&quot;

Bateson used the fictional Bread and Butter Fly (from &quot;Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot;) to illustrate the double bind in terms of natural selection. The gnat points out that the insect would be doomed if he found his food (which would dissolve his own head, since this insect&#x27;s head is made of sugar, and his only food is tea), and starve if he did not. Alice suggests that this must happen quite often, to which the gnat replies: &quot;It always happens.&quot;

The pressures that drive evolution therefore represent a genuine double bind. And there is truly no escape: &quot;It always happens.&quot; No species can escape natural selection, including our own.

Bateson suggested that all evolution is driven by the double bind, whenever circumstances change: If any environment becomes toxic to any species, that species will die out unless it transforms into another species, in which case, the species becomes extinct anyway.

Most significant here is Bateson&#x27;s exploration of what he later came to call &quot;the pattern that connects&quot;—that problems of communication which span more than one level (e.g., the relationship between the individual and the family) should also be expected to be found spanning other pairs of levels in the hierarchy (e.g. the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype):

&quot;We are very far, then, from being able to pose specific questions for the geneticist; but I believe that the wider implications of what I have been saying modify somewhat the philosophy of genetics. Our approach to the problems of schizophrenia by way of a theory of levels or logical types has disclosed first that the problems of adaptation and learning and their pathologies must be considered in terms of a hierarchic system in which stochastic change occurs at the boundary points between the segments of the hierarchy. We have considered three such regions of stochastic change—the level of genetic mutation, the level of learning, and the level of change in family organization. We have disclosed the possibility of a relationship of these levels which orthodox genetics would deny, and we have disclosed that at least in human societies the evolutionary system consists not merely in the selective survival of those persons who happen to select appropriate environments but also in the modification of family environment in a direction which might enhance the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the individual members.&quot;

==Girard&#x27;s mimetic double bind==
René Girard, in his literary theory of mimetic desire, proposes what he calls a &quot;model-obstacle&quot;, a role model who demonstrates an object of desire and yet, in possessing that object, becomes a rival who obstructs fulfillment of the desire. According to Girard, the &quot;internal mediation&quot; of this mimetic dynamic &quot;operates along the same lines as what Gregory Bateson called the &#x27;double bind&#x27;.&quot; Girard found in Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic theory, a precursor to mimetic desire. &quot;The individual who &#x27;adjusts&#x27; has managed to relegate the two contradictory injunctions of the double bind—to imitate and not to imitate—to two different domains of application. This is, he divides reality in such a way as to neutralize the &quot;double bind&quot;.&quot; While critical of Freud&#x27;s doctrine of the unconscious mind, Girard sees the ancient Greek tragedy, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, and key elements of Freud&#x27;s Oedipus complex, patricidal and incestuous desire, to serve as prototypes for his own analysis of the mimetic double bind.

==Neuro-linguistic programming==
Neuro-linguistic programming, a pseudoscientific approach to communication, also makes use of the expression &quot;double bind&quot;. Grinder and Bandler (both of whom had personal contact with Bateson and Erickson) asserted that a message could be constructed with multiple messages, whereby the recipient of the message is given the impression of choice—although both options have the same outcome at a higher level of intention. This is called a &quot;double bind&quot; in NLP terminology, and has applications in both sales and therapy. In therapy, the practitioner may seek to challenge destructive double binds that limit the client in some way and may also construct double binds in which both options have therapeutic consequences. In a sales context, the speaker may give the respondent the illusion of choice between two possibilities. For example, a salesperson might ask: &quot;Would you like to pay cash or by credit card?&quot;, with both outcomes presupposing that the person will make the purchase; whereas the third option (that of not buying) is intentionally excluded from the spoken choices.

Note that in the NLP context, the use of the phrase &quot;double bind&quot; does not carry the primary definition of two conflicting messages; it is about creating a false sense of choice which ultimately binds to the intended outcome. In the &quot;cash or credit card?&quot; example, this is not a &quot;Bateson double bind&quot; since there is no contradiction, although it still is an &quot;NLP double bind&quot;. Similarly if a salesman were selling a book about the evils of commerce, it could perhaps be a &quot;Bateson double bind&quot; if the buyer happened to believe that commerce was evil, yet felt compelled or obliged to buy the book.

<text>Bonk, known as in Japan and as PC Kid or B.C. Kid in PAL territories, is a video game character and former mascot for NEC&#x27;s PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 video game console. Three platform games featuring the character appeared on the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, as well as two spin-offs featuring Air Zonk. The protagonist is a bald caveman named Bonk who attacks using his comically large head.

His Japanese name PC-Genjin is a pun on the PC Engine, with his European name &quot;PC Kid&quot; similarly referencing the system&#x27;s name (the console is also called PC Engine in Europe). The &quot;PC&quot; part of his Japanese and European names also stands for &quot;Pithecanthropus Computerurus&quot;, a fictitious species name for the character. The American title &quot;Bonk&quot; is also not used in the European versions due to the word &quot;&quot; being connoted with having sex in British English.

Konami now owns the rights to the &quot;Bonk&quot; series as a result of its absorption of the series&#x27; publisher Hudson Soft in 2012.

==Origin==
As stated on Hudson Soft&#x27;s website, in their &quot;The Definitive Bonk&quot; article, Bonk was originally created as a comic character, PC Caveman (Genjin), in a magazine for the PC Engine. Many people liked the character and there were talks held on giving him a game of his own. In addition to this, many people even mistook him for an upcoming game character even before his game was in development, because the magazine frequently featured comics of upcoming games.

==Games==
Bonk&#x27;s Adventure (PC-Genjin in Japan, PC Kid in Europe) was the first game starring Bonk and was released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1989. A variation of the TG-16 original eventually appeared on the NES with fewer colors and reduced graphic quality. Another variation was released for the Amiga under the name BC Kid. A completely new game, with 2-player co-op, was released for the arcades, while another new game utilizing the same name was released for the Game Boy. A remake of the original was released in Japan many years later on the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube.

Bonk&#x27;s Revenge (PC-Genjin 2 in Japan, PC Kid 2 in Europe) was released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1991, while a completely different game using the same name made it to the Game Boy, the TurboGrafx-16 version was re-released for Windows on December 13, 2013, and the Wii U Virtual Console on March 12, 2014, in Japan.

Bonk 3: Bonk&#x27;s Big Adventure (PC-Genjin 3) was released for the TurboGrafx-16 as 2 versions in 1993: a TurboChip (cartridge) version and a Super CD-ROM version, the latter of which featured an updated redbook audio soundtrack.

Super Bonk (Super Genjin, Super B.C. Kid) was the 4th game in the series and was released for the Super NES in 1994. It was the first entry in the &quot;Bonk&quot; series to not be released for the TurboGrafx-16. &quot;Super Bonk&quot; was later re-released for Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console in Japan on November 16, 2010, the PAL region on December 10, and in North America on April 4, 2011.

Super Genjin 2 was the 5th and final console game in the series. It was the follow-up to &quot;Super Bonk&quot;, and was released in 1995 only in Japan on the Super Famicom (Super NES).

GB Genjin Land: Viva! Chikkun Kingdom was a collection of mini games starring Bonk, released for the Game Boy.

Genjin Collection, a collection of the 3 Game Boy titles, was released for the Game Boy.

Bonk&#x27;s Return was released for mobile phones. It features gameplay similar to that of the first two &quot;Bonk&quot; games.

The TurboGrafx-16 version of &quot;Bonk&#x27;s Adventure&quot; was released for the Virtual Console service at its launch on November 21, 2006. &quot;Bonk&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was released on April 16, 2007, and &quot;Bonk 3: Bonk&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; was released on September 3 in the same year, in the United States.

=== Unreleased games ===
A conversion of &quot;PC Genjin&quot; titled &quot;Genjin Show: Tobidase! VB Genjin&quot; was planned for the Virtual Boy, with a former Hudson Soft employee stating that he played &quot;Virtual Bomberman&quot; as reference during development but the adaptation was scrapped due to the commercial and critical failure of the platform. &quot;PC Alajin&quot;, &quot;Bonk Strategy&quot; (&quot;Uesugi Genjin&quot; in Japan), &quot;PC Genjin no Te-to-Risu&quot;, &quot;Bonk IV: The Role-Playing Game/Bonk&#x27;s Quest&quot; (&quot;RPG Genjin&quot; in Japan), &quot;Ultra Genjin&quot; and &quot;Bonk 3D&quot; were planned for the TurboGrafx-16, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo 3DS respectively, but were never released. &quot;Ultra Genjin&quot; eventually became Bomberman Hero for the Nintendo 64. A new &quot;Bonk&quot; game developed by Pi Studios, Bonk: Brink of Extinction, was announced for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, WiiWare and the Nintendo 3DS. The title would have included cooperative play but it was cancelled.

<doc id="937355" wikidata="Q270686" url="?curid=937355" title="Leisel Jones">
<text>Leisel Marie Jones, OAM (born 30 August 1985) is an Australian former competition swimmer and Olympic gold medallist. A participant in the 2000 Summer Olympics – at just 15 years old – and 2004 Summer Olympics, she was part of gold-medal-winning Australian team in the women&#x27;s 4×100-metre medley relay at the Athens Games in 2004 and a gold medallist for 100-metre breaststroke in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

On 17 March 2012, Jones earned selection to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and became the first Australian swimmer to compete at four Olympic games. There, she won her ninth Olympic medal, a silver medal in the 4×100-metre medley relay.

Jones is noted for employing a classic breaststroke technique, typified by a slow but deeper stroke cycle and also by her slow starts. Along with South African champion Penny Heyns, she is regarded as one of the greatest breaststroke swimmers ever.

==Personal==
While at Southern Cross Catholic College, Jones used to train at the Redcliffe club in Scarborough, Queensland, and was coached by Ken Wood. Her training partners included fellow Australian team members, Geoff Huegill and Jessicah Schipper. After her disappointing campaign in Athens, Jones moved to train at the Fortitude Valley Pool in Brisbane, Australia, alongside Libby Lenton, under Swiss-born coach Stephan Widmar at the Commercial Swimming Club. Following the move, Jones began to speak openly about the depression and self-esteem issues that had plagued her following her being thrust into the spotlight at such a young age. The successes that followed endeared her to an Australian public that had been critical of her attitude following her failure to capture individual gold in Athens. Some, including Dawn Fraser, believed Jones had acted immaturely and ungratefully, particularly in her indifferent displays of emotion during post-race interviews and medal ceremonies.

In 2009, Jones became the new face of the World Animal Protection Australia &amp; New Zealand anti-whaling campaign.

Jones confirmed her retirement from swimming in November 2012. She planned to begin a university degree in psychology in 2013.

In 2015, Jones published an autobiography titled &quot;Body Lengths&quot;.

==Career==
Jones was selected for the Australian team at just 14 years of age, qualifying in the 100-metre breaststroke by winning the event at the Australian Championships in May 2000 in Sydney, ending the international career of former world champion Samantha Riley.

===2000 Olympics===
Jones swam a personal best in the final at the Sydney Olympics to claim an unexpected silver medal behind American Megan Quann. She also combined with Dyana Calub, Petria Thomas and Susie O&#x27;Neill in the 4×100-metre medley relay to win silver, again behind the Americans. Jones left school aged 15 to concentrate on swimming.

At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Jones was now one of the established swimmers and expected to win medals. She finished second to China&#x27;s Luo Xuejuan. The competition also marked her international debut in the 200-metre breaststroke, where she came fourth place (2:25.46). She also collected a gold in the medley relay alongside Calub, Thomas and Sarah Ryan, the first time that the US women had been beaten at world or Olympic level in this event, excluding the systemically doped East German and Chinese teams.

In 2002, Jones claimed her first titles on the international arena, claiming the breaststroke double at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England. Australia also won the medley relay.

In 2003, Jones set an Australian record in the 200-metre individual medley earlier in the year, in an experimental event. Later at the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain, she started setting a world record in the semifinals of the 100-metre breaststroke (1:06.37). However, she succumbed to nerves in the final and came third, with Luo again winning the event. She also achieved a silver in the 200-metre breaststroke in Barcelona, behind Amanda Beard in (2:24.33). She collected a bronze in the medley relay.

In the month leading up to the Athens Olympics, Jones set a world record (2:22.96) in the 200-metre breaststroke in a meet in Brisbane, Australia. This led to high expectations of an even better performance in Athens, as Jones had not been rested prior to swimming the world record. However, it was reclaimed by Beard at the US Olympic trials only a few days later.

===2004 Olympics===
In Athens, Jones was again the quickest qualifier of the 100-metre breaststroke, after setting an Olympic record (1:06.78) in the semifinals, which was almost two seconds clear of the then second fastest swimmer in the event&#x27;s history, Amanda Beard. However, in the final race she finished in the bronze position. In the 200-metre breaststroke, she attempted to take an attacking approach, but faded in the last 50 metres and was pipped to the wall by Amanda Beard, winning silver. Australia went on to win the 4×100-metre medley relay, giving Jones her first Olympic gold.

Jones&#x27; world record in the 100-metre breaststroke was broken at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Canada by Jessica Hardy of the United States in 1:06.20, again in the semifinal. However, this time the expectations turned to Hardy and Jones turned the tables and beat her to the wall, breaking through for her first win at world or Olympic level. She also broke the world record for the 200-metre breaststroke (2:21.72), on 29 July 2005. In the process she won the gold medal, leaving her rivals more than six metres behind. For her efforts she was named by &quot;Swimming World magazine&quot; as the Female World Swimmer of the Year in 2005.

The changes which occurred in 2005 continued to pay off at the Australian Commonwealth Games Swimming Trials in early 2006 where Jones broke her personal best time in the 50-metre breaststroke (30.85) and took 1.18 seconds off her previous world record in the 200-metre breaststroke (2.20:54). On Day 5 of the Australian Nationals Jones swam a world record in the 100-metre breaststroke final. Jones won the Australian championship in a time of 1:05.71 which lowered the previous mark by 0.49 of a second.

Jones completed a clean sweep of the breaststroke events (50-, 100- and 200-metre) at the 2006 Commonwealth Games—the only time this has been achieved in the breaststroke events in the games&#x27; history. In the butterfly events (50-, 100- and 200-metre) at the 2002 Manchester Games, Petria Thomas was the first swimmer in Commonwealth Games history to complete a clean sweep. The 50-metre events were introduced at the Manchester Games. In the 50-metre breaststroke, an event she had only recently begun competing in, she defeated the reigning world champion and world record-holder Jade Edmistone. She later won another gold in the 200-metre breaststroke and completed the sweep with the gold medal in the 100-metre in a world record time of 1:05.09 – an effort that saw her own world record reduced 0.62 of a second and was declared &quot;Beamonesque&quot; by aquatics journalist Craig Lord, a reference to Bob Beamon&#x27;s legendary long jump at the Mexico City Olympics. A fourth gold medal in world record time in the 4×100-metre medley relay with Sophie Edington, Jessicah Schipper and Libby Lenton rounded off her Commonwealth Games.

In 2007, she competed in the World Championships and won the 100-metre breaststroke, 200-metre breaststroke, and 4×100-metre medley relay, setting a world record in the relay. She also won silver in the 50-metre breaststroke. She then left Brisbane and Widmer to move to Melbourne to train under Rohan Taylor, so that she could live with her fiancé Marty Pask, an Australian rules footballer with the Western Bulldogs. Her dissolution of a successful partnership raised eyebrows and many questioned whether putting her personal life ahead of a proven competitive formula would backfire in the pool.

In early 2008, she won the breaststroke double at the 2008 Australian Swimming Championships to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.

Although missing the World Short Course Championships in Manchester due to the preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics she broke her own world record over 100-metre breaststroke (SC) in 1:03.72 at the Telstra Grand Prix in Canberra.

===2008 Olympics===

Jones won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in 100-metre breaststroke, touching the line a full body length ahead of her rival. Her time of 1:05.17 was 1.66 seconds faster than the American silver medalist Rebecca Soni. While she was the favourite to win in the 200-metre breaststroke, she was beaten by Soni, who won gold in world record time. Jones took the silver. She also won a gold medal in the 4×100-metre medley relay, with the Australian team breaking the previous world record by three seconds.

Jones was awarded the Telstra Swimmer Of The Year award as part of the year&#x27;s international all-star team, in Sydney in October 2008.

At the World Cup meeting at Berlin, Germany, Jones set world records in the 100- and 200-metre breaststroke (short course). Jones had a low-key year and opted out of the 2009 World Championships.

===2012 Olympics===
Jones confirmed that she was aiming for the 2012 Olympics in London and competed at the Pan Pacific Championships and the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Jones confirmed her place on these teams by winning the 50-, 100- and 200-metre breaststroke at the 2010 Telstra Australian Swimming Championships.

At the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, in 2010 Jones collected three silver medals and a bronze. She competed in the 50-metre breaststroke (bronze) 100-metre breaststroke (silver), 200-metre breaststroke (silver), and the 4×100-metre medley relay (silver) events. In all four of events, she was behind the Americans; in the 50-metre she was behind Jessica Hardy and fellow Australian Leiston Pickett, and in the 100- and 200-metre she finished behind Rebecca Soni.

After earning selection to compete at the 2012 London Olympics, Jones became the first Australian swimmer to compete at four Olympic games. Together with Emily Seebohm, Alicia Coutts and Melanie Schlanger, she won a silver medal for Australia in the 4×100-metre medley relay.

=== Retirement ===
Jones confirmed her retirement from swimming on 16 November 2012.

In 2015, Jones appeared in the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (Australian TV series)&quot;. She was, however, voted off the show in the first week.

In January 2016, Jones graduated from the Nutrition Coach course at the Australian Institute of Fitness. She believes she is &quot;so much more informed now&quot; than when she was swimming in terms of good nutrition.

<text>Gérard Paul Deshayes (; 13 May 1795 – 9 June 1875) was a French geologist and conchologist.

==Career==

He was born in Nancy, his father at that time being professor of experimental physics in the École Centrale of the département Meurthe

He studied medicine in Strasbourg, and afterwards took the degree of &quot;bachelier ès lettres&quot; in Paris in 1821; but he abandoned the medical profession in order to devote himself to natural history. For some time he gave private lessons on geology, and subsequently became professor of natural history in the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle.

He was distinguished for his researches on the fossil mollusca of the Paris Basin and of other areas Cenozoic cover. His studies on the relations of the fossil to the recent species led him as early as 1829 to conclusions somewhat similar to those arrived at by Lyell, to whom Deshayes rendered much assistance in connection with the classification of the, then, Tertiary system into Eocene, Miocene and Pliocene.

With André Étienne d&#x27;Audebert de Férussac, he co-authored an important study on terrestrial and river mollusks titled &quot;Histoire naturelle générale et particulière des Mollusques terrestres et fluviatiles&quot; (1820-1851). In 1839 he began the publication of his &quot;Traité élémentaire de conchyliologie&quot;, the last part of which was not issued until 1857. In the same year (1839) he went to Algeria for the French government, and spent three years in explorations in that country. His principal work, which resulted from the collections he made, &quot;Mollusques de l&#x27;Algérie&quot;, was issued (incomplete) in 1848.

He was a member of the Société Géologique de France, of which he served as chairman several times. In 1870 the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London was awarded to him. He died in Boran-sur-Oise.

== Works ==
His publications included:
*&quot;Description des coquilles fossiles des environs de Paris&quot; (2 vols. and atlas, 1824-1837)

<doc id="937362" wikidata="Q5260776" url="?curid=937362" title="Deposit interest retention tax">
<text>Deposit interest retention tax (DIRT; ) is a form of tax on interest earned on bank accounts in Republic of Ireland that was first introduced in the 1980s. In Ireland, income from any source is reckonable for taxation purposes. The Revenue Commissioners believed that the large majority of interest earners were declining to report it and that the most efficient method to collect at least the basic rate tax would be to deduct it at source. After PAYE, it was Ireland&#x27;s second experience of a withholding tax.

== Rates ==

=== Current Rate ===
DIRT is deducted at source by financial institutions. The current rate of DIRT is 33%, having been reduced from higher rates in preceding years.

=== Higher DIRT Rate ===
A &#x27;higher rate&#x27; of 36% applied to some interest up until the end of 2013. This applied where interest could not be calculated at least annually or could not be determined until it was paid.

== Exemptions and Refunds ==
People who are permanently incapacitated, as well as people who are at least 65 years old and receive income less than the exemption limit (currently €18,000), may claim a refund of DIRT or may submit an appropriate form to their banks or financial institutions to have interest paid free of DIRT.

== History ==
It was controversial because taxpayers cannot withhold it in protest because it is taken at source. Some argued that it discourages saving among low-income families, who would not otherwise be liable for taxation, but who might also not understand the need to claim exemption.

==Evasion==
In the late 1990s a parliamentary inquiry under Jim Mitchell, TD, established the existence of a culture of encouraging tax evasion within Irish banks, which had allowed wealthy customers to set up non-resident (off-shore, international) bank accounts into which money was transferred, enabling the account holder to avoid paying DIRT. (Such accounts in theory should only have been set up by foreign investors, who would of course pay any tax due to their local authorities.) Thousands of tax-evaders were prosecuted as were leading banks, producing hundreds of millions of Irish pounds of the Irish Exchequer through financial settlements and fines. Several famous Irish people have been found evading the tax, including (former) Minister for Justice Pádraig Flynn. The Committee was of the view that the Central Bank of Ireland had an inappropriate and outmoded approach to supervision in the context of the growing sophistication of banking and the changing role of banks. It also found there was an insufficient concern with ethics and supervision other than from the standpoint of a traditional and narrow concern with prudential supervision in the Central Bank. The Chairman of the inquiry was &quot;shocked and horrified&quot; at the &quot;careless and reckless&quot; manner in which the Governor had quoted false statistics to the Public Accounts subcommittee.

<text>Oswald Heer (or Oswald von Heer) (31 August 1809 – 27 September 1883), Swiss geologist and naturalist, was born at Niederuzwil in Canton of St. Gallen and died in Lausanne.

==Biography==
Oswald Heer was educated as a clergyman at Halle and took holy orders, and he also graduated as Doctor of Philosophy and medicine. Early in life his interest was aroused in entomology, on which subject he acquired special knowledge, and later he took up the study of plants and became one of the pioneers in paleobotany, distinguished for his researches on the Miocene flora.

In 1837, Carl Daniel Friedrich Meissner (1800–1874) a Swiss botanist named a genus of flowering plants (in the family of Anacardiaceae) from South Africa after him, &quot;Heeria&quot;.

In 1851, Heer became professor of botany in the university of Zürich, and for some time he was the director of what is now the Old Botanical Garden in that city. He directed his attention to the Tertiary plants and insects of Switzerland. In 1863 (with William Pengelly, &quot;Phil. Trans.&quot;, 1862) he investigated the plant-remains from the lignite-deposits of Bovey Tracey in Devon, regarding them as of Miocene age; but they are now classed as Eocene.

Heer also reported on the Miocene flora of Arctic regions (fossil plant remains brought back from Northwest Greenland by K. J. V. Steenstrup), on the plants of the Pleistocene lignites of Dürnten, and on the cereals of some of the lake-dwellings (&quot;Die Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten&quot;, 1866).

In 1862, Heer was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Charles Darwin regarded Heer as an authority on fossil plants, and corresponded with him. The two men disagreed over evolution, but were on cordial terms. In a letter in 1875, Heer described to Darwin in some detail a new dicotyledonous angiosperm fossil that he had identified in the lower Cretaceous in the arctic, which appeared to allow slightly more time for the evolution of dicots than Darwin had previously been aware of. Heer published a critique of Darwinism in volume 2 of his 1867 book &quot;The Primaeval World of Switzerland&quot;, concluding &quot;All these facts afford arguments against a slow and uniformly progressive transformation of species, and lead to the conclusion that the transformation of organic nature took place in a period of comparatively limited duration&quot; (p. 288). He believed in progressive creation: &quot;Times of creation occurred during which was accomplished a remoulding of organic types, and there was a primaeval epoch during which the first species were brought into being. Even if the first species were extremely simple, for them an act of creation must be admitted, an act without example in modern times; for in our days plants and animals of decidedly low forms proceed from species already in existence&quot; (p. 291, &quot;The Primaeval World of Switzerland&quot;).

During a great part of his career Heer was hampered by slender means and ill-health, but his services to science were acknowledged in 1874 when the Geological Society of London awarded to him the Wollaston medal. He died at Lausanne on 27 September 1883.

Heer published &quot;Flora Tertiaria Helvetiae&quot; (3 vols., 1855–1859); &quot;Die Urwelt der Schweiz&quot; (1865), and &quot;Flora fossilis Arctica&quot; (1868–1883) and with Eduard Heinrich Graeffe. The cape Heerodden in Nordenskiöld Land on Spitsbergen is named after him, as well as the Bear Island mountain Oswaldfjellet.

<text>Sonicaid Ltd was a medical electronics company headquartered in West Sussex best known for its range of Doppler fetal monitors. The company also developed early ultrasound scanners. The word &quot;Sonicaid&quot; is in generic use for Doppler fetal monitors. Sonicaid is now a registered trademark of Huntleigh Healthcare.

== Fetal monitors ==
Sonicaid developed a range of fetal monitors, notably the portable Doppler ultrasound products D102, D104 (&quot;Pocket Sonicaid&quot;, winner of a Design Council Award for medical equipment in 1976), D205 and D206 which provided audible output of fetal heart sounds. The original design was due to Frederick (Doug) Fielder who was Sonicaid&#x27;s medical research director.

The FM series products used both ultrasound and ECG to provide continuous monitoring (recorded on paper charts), enabling clinical interpretation of changes in fetal heart rate during contractions. The FM3R received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1977 and one of these instruments is displayed at the Science Museum, London (the &quot;machine that goes ping&quot; in The Meaning of Life is identifiable as this model).

== Ultrasound scanners ==
Sonicaid Ltd was involved in an early venture in the development of a 3D multiplanar scanner in the mid-1970s, building on the pioneering obstetric ultrasonography work by Prof Ian Donald and colleagues. They also developed the Sonicaid RTS5200 Real Time Scanner which was used in hospitals for obstetric applications.

== Company history ==
Sonicaid Ltd was based in Bognor Regis in the 1970s with a unit in Livingston, Scotland, and in Chichester in the 1980s. The company was acquired in 1987 by Oxford Instruments and developed the product range further as &quot;Oxford Sonicaid&quot;.

<text>George Busk FRS FRAI (12 August 1807 – 10 August 1886) was a British naval surgeon, zoologist and palaeontologist.

==Early life, family and education==
Busk was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. He was the son of the merchant Robert Busk and his wife Jane. Robert Busk was the son of Sir Wadsworth Busk, who was an Attorney General of the Isle of Man and grandfather of Anna Jane Busk (1813-1888) whose grandson, William George Lupton (1871-1911), was named in honour of George. Jane Busk&#x27;s father, John Westly, was Customs House clerk in St. Petersburg.

Busk studied at Dr. Hartley&#x27;s School in Yorkshire. He studied surgery in London, at both St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and for one session at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital.

==Career==
Busk was appointed assistant-surgeon to the Greenwich Hospital in 1832. He served as naval surgeon first in . He later served for many years in , which had fought at Trafalgar. In Busk&#x27;s time it was used by the Seamen&#x27;s Hospital Society as a hospital ship for ex-members of the Merchant Navy or fishing fleet and their dependants. During this period Busk made important observations on cholera and on scurvy.

He founded the Greenwich Natural History Society in 1852, serving as its president until 1858.

In 1855, he retired from service and from medicine and settled in London, where he devoted himself mainly to the study of zoology and palaeontology. As early as 1842, he assisted in editing the &quot;Microscopical Journal&quot;; and later he edited the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science&quot; (1853–68) and the &quot;Natural History Review&quot; (1861–65). He was a member of the famous X-Club, founded by T. H. Huxley, which was active in revitalising science in the period 1865–1885. Busk and his wife Ellen were close friends of Huxley. Busk successfully nominated Charles Darwin for the Copley Medal, the highest award of the Royal Society, in 1864.

From 1856 to 1859, he was Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology in the Royal College of Surgeons, and he became President of the college in 1871. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1850. Busk was an active member of the Linnean Society, the Geological Society and president of the Ethnological Society and then the Anthropological Institute (1873–74). He received the Royal Society&#x27;s Royal Medal and the Geological Society&#x27;s Wollaston and Lyell medals.

Busk was the leading authority on the Polyzoa; and later the vertebrate remains from caverns and river deposits occupied his attention. In 1862, Busk was again in Gibraltar. He was responsible of bringing to England the Gibraltar skull (the second Neanderthal fossil ever found and the first known &quot;adult&quot; one) which was excavated at Gibraltar in 1848. The identification of the skull as belonging to a Neanderthal was not made until the 20th century.

==Personal life and demise==
On 12 August 1843, George Busk married Ellen Busk, his first cousin. They had two daughters.

He died in London on 10 August 1886 and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, in the northern section of the central circle.

<text>Jimboomba is a town and locality in the City of Logan, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Jimboomba had a population of 7,423 people.

==Geography==
Jimboomba is situated on the Mount Lindesay Highway, by road south-east of Logan Central and by road south of Brisbane central business district. The western part of Jimboomba is bordered by the new suburb of Glenlogan and the Logan River; the only bridge within the locality is Payne Bridge on Cusack Lane (). There is a low-level older bridge immediately to the north of Payne Bridge, but this cannot be used by vehicular traffic.

The Queensland Government&#x27;s current plan is that Jimboomba will become a major residential and business area within the Brisbane metropolitan region, as part of the Greater Flagstone Priority Development Area, which will house up to 150,000 additional residents in coming decades.

Although historically a rural area, as at 2021, the land use in Jimboomba is almost entirely residential.

==History==
The original spelling was &quot;Gimboomba&quot;, named after a sheep and livestock station based where the township is today, stretching some distance north, east and south to neighbouring areas. &quot;Gimboomba&quot; is a Gugingin word (the First Australian peoples of the area, of Yugambeh country) meaning &quot;place of loud thunder and little rain&quot; . A culture trail celebrating First Australian culture is based at a local primary school bearing the name &#x27;Loud Thunder&#x27; paying respect to its traditional owners. It was leased for grazing in those days and was taken up by Thomas Dowse during 1845–48. It was then transferred to Sydney publican Robert Rowlands and was later taken up by Andrew Inglis Henderson in 1851 to be used as a sheep run and subsequently for cattle grazing.

Jimboomba railway station () was on the disused Beaudesert railway line from Bethania to Beaudesert that was established to service the abattoir in Beaudesert. The line opened on 16 May 1888. The line was closed in 1995 and then reopened and operated as a tourist service as far as Logan Village by railway enthusiasts from 1999 until mid-2004. Funds were harder to raise and depleted quickly for the line so it was closed permanently.

Jimboomba Timber Reserve Provisional School opened circa 1899. In 1906 it was renamed Martindale Provisional School. On 1 January 1909 it became Martindale State School. It was in the area of Gittins Road (now in Riverbend, approx ). It closed in 1922. The school building was then relocated to Cedar Grove, where it opened as Cedar Grove State School in 1923. It closed in 1965.

Jimboomba Provisional School opened on 12 May 1890, becoming Jimboomba State School on 1 June 1900.

Emmaus Primary School opened in 2002. Sponsored by Brisbane Catholic Education, the school was established as an ecumenical school in association with the local Anglican, Lutheran and Uniting Church communities. In 2005, it was renamed Emmaus College in preparation for adding secondary education in 2006.

Formerly in the Shire of Beaudesert, Jimboomba became part of Logan City following the local government amalgamations in March 2008.

South Queensland Academy (SQA), a Japanese international school, opened in Jimboomba in 1992. It closed in 2006. It was located at Lot 4, Johanna Street. It was replaced by the Hills International College.

On 29 September 2017, areas in the east of the locality were excised to create the new localities of Glenlogan and Riverbend and to allow for the expansion of the boundaries of Flagstone and South Maclean.

<text>Laurent-Guillaume de Koninck (3 May 1809 – 16 July 1887) was a Belgian palaeontologist and chemist, born at Leuven.

He studied medicine in the university of his native town, and in 1831 he became assistant in the chemical schools. He pursued the study of chemistry in Paris, Berlin and Gießen, and was subsequently engaged in teaching the science at Ghent and Liège. In 1856 he was appointed professor of chemistry in the Liège University, and he retained this post until the close of his life.

About the year 1835 he began to devote his leisure to the investigation of the Carboniferous fossils around Liège, and ultimately he became distinguished for his researches on the palaeontology of the Palaeozoic rocks, and especially for his descriptions of the molluscs, brachiopods, crustaceans and crinoids of the Carboniferous limestone of Belgium. In recognition of this work the Wollaston medal was awarded to him in 1875 by the Geological Society of London, and in 1876 he was appointed professor of palaeontology at Liège. In 1882, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

He was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1886.

<doc id="937392" wikidata="Q334228" url="?curid=937392" title="Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 10th Baronet">
<text>Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton, 10th Baronet FRS (13 November 1806 – 5 April 1881) was an English palaeontologist and Conservative politician from the Egerton family. He sat in the House of Commons variously between 1830 and his death in 1881.

== Early life ==

Egerton was the son of Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 9th Baronet and his wife Rebecca Du Pre, daughter of Josias Du Pre of Wilton Park, Beaconsfield. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1828. While at college his interest in geology was aroused by the lectures of William Buckland, and by his acquaintance with William D. Conybeare. He inherited the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1829. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1831, and was a trustee of the British Museum. When it was first established in 1834 he became a trustee of the Senate of the University of London.

== Geological work ==

While travelling in Switzerland with Lord Cole (later to be 3rd Earl of Enniskillen) they were introduced to Prof. L Agassiz at Neufchâtel, and determined to make a special study of fossil fish. During the course of fifty years they gradually gathered together two of the largest and finest of private collections—that of Sir Philip Grey Egerton being at Oulton Park, Tarporley, Cheshire.

Egerton described the structure and affinities of numerous species in the publications of the Geological Society of London, the &quot;Geological Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Decades of the Geological Survey&quot;; and in recognition of his services the Wollaston medal was awarded to him in 1873 by the Geological Society. He was elected FRS in 1831, and was a trustee of the British Museum. He was also a member of Grillion&#x27;s Club, and compiled a history of the club&#x27;s first fifty years in a book: &#x27;Grillion&#x27;s Club: From Its Origin in 1812 To Its Fiftieth Anniversary&#x27;, published in 1880.

He was a member of the founding council of the Ray Society.

== Political life ==

Egerton was a prominent local dignitary, as Deputy Lieutenant of Cheshire and J.P. for the county. He held the post in the militia as Lieutenant Colonel in the Cheshire Yeomanry. He was elected Member of Parliament for the city of Chester in 1830 but lost the seat in 1831. He stood unsuccessfully at Cheshire South in 1832 but was elected in 1835 and held the seat until 1868. He was elected MP for West Cheshire from 1868 until his death in London on 5 April 1881.

== Legacy ==

Egerton&#x27;s collection of fossil fishes is now in the Natural History Museum, London. He is commemorated in the scientific names of the Rusty-fronted barwing (&quot;Actinodura egertoni&quot; Gould, 1836) and Early Jurassic brittle star fossil, &quot;Palaeocoma egertoni&quot; (Broderip, 1840), although the latter is now considered a junior synonym of the type species, &quot;Palaeocoma milleri&quot; (Phillips, 1829).

The Egerton Bascule Bridge and Egerton Dock, located at Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England are also named in honour of Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton.

== Family ==
He married on 8 March 1832, Anna Elizabeth, third daughter of George John Legh

<text>Louis Charles Breguet (; 2 January 1880 in Paris – 4 May 1955 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye) was a French aircraft designer and builder, one of the early aviation pioneers.

== Biography ==
Louis Charles Breguet was the grandson of Louis Clément François Breguet, and great-great-grandson of the famous horologist Abraham-Louis Breguet.

In 1902 Louis married Nelly Girardet, the daughter of painter Eugène Girardet. They had five children together.

In 1903, he graduated from École supérieure d&#x27;électricité, which was the top electrical engineering school in France.

In 1905, with his brother Jacques, and under the guidance of Charles Richet, he began work on a gyroplane (the forerunner of the helicopter) with flexible wings. On 29 September 1907, at his workshop at La Brayelle, it achieved the first ascent of a vertical-flight aircraft with a pilot, albeit only to a height of . It was also not a free flight, as four men were used to steady the structure.

He built his first fixed-wing aircraft, the Breguet Type I, in 1909, flying it successfully before crashing it at the Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation held at Reims. In 1911, he founded the Société anonyme des ateliers d’aviation Louis Breguet. In 1912, Breguet constructed his first hydroplane.

He is especially known for his development of reconnaissance aircraft used by the French in World War I and through the 1920s. One of the pioneers in the construction of metal aircraft, the Breguet 14 single-engined day bomber, perhaps one of the most widely used French warplanes of its time, had an airframe constructed almost entirely of aluminium structural members. As well as the French, sixteen squadrons of the American Expeditionary Force also used it. A plane of this type has a major role in the plot of the 1927 thriller So Disdained by Nevil Shute.

In 1919 he founded the Compagnie des messageries aériennes, which evolved into Air France.

Over the years, his aircraft set several records. A Breguet plane made the first nonstop crossing of the South Atlantic in 1927. Another made a flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1933, the longest nonstop Atlantic flight up to that time.

He returned to his work on the gyroplane in 1935. Created with co-designer René Dorand, the craft, called the Gyroplane Laboratoire, flew by a combination of blade flapping and feathering. On 22 December 1935 it established a speed record of 67 mph (108 km/h). It was the first to demonstrate speed as well as good control characteristics. The next year, it set an altitude record of 517 feet (158 m).

Breguet remained an important manufacturer of aircraft during World War II and afterwards developed commercial transports. Breguet’s range equation, for determining aircraft range, is also named after him.
He died of a heart attack in 1955 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

In 1980, Breguet was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

== Olympic sailing ==
Breguet, as helmsman of his yacht &quot;Namousa&quot;, won a bronze medal in sailing during the 1924 Summer Olympics.

<text>VEB Polytechnik was a company from the German Democratic Republic (GDR) located in Chemnitz (then called Karl-Marx-Stadt). In the GDR, it was mainly known for producing overhead projectors, called Polylux.

The company was founded in 1870 as &quot;Reißzeugrichter&quot; and manufactured drawing table tools. In 1874 the founder Emil Oskar Richter invented the bow compass. After switching its focus to overhead projectors in the late 1960s, it was renamed to VEB Polytechnik. After the collapse of the GDR, the remains of VEB Polytechnik were rescued in a new company called Polytechnik Frankenberg GmbH. It produced overhead projectors and hand lever cutting machines. The new company was closed in 2006.

In 1983, the company started manufacturing a microcomputer teaching kit called &quot;Poly-Computer 880&quot;. VEB Polytechnik is also known for creating &quot;Poly Play&quot;, the only arcade video game to be made in the German Democratic Republic.

<doc id="937398" wikidata="Q429933" url="?curid=937398" title="Logan River">
<text>The Logan River (Yugambeh: Dugulumba) is a perennial river in the Scenic Rim, Logan and Gold Coast local government areas of the South East region of Queensland, Australia. The -long river is one of the dominant waterways in South East Queensland that drains the southern ranges of the Scenic Rim and empties into Moreton Bay after navigating the City of Logan, a major suburban centre located south of Brisbane. The catchment is dominated by urban and agricultural land use. Near the river mouth are mangrove forests and a number of aquaculture farms.

==Course and features==

The river rises below Mount Ernest on the southern slopes of the Scenic Rim, part of the Great Dividing Range and forms in the Mount Barney National Park, near the QueenslandNew South Wales border, below Mount Lindesay. The river flows generally north by northeast, joined by eleven minor tributaries, before heading east and eventually emptying into Moreton Bay. Its principal tributaries are the Albert River which joins it just east of Beenleigh; Teviot Brook which begins at Mount Superbus and joins the Logan River at Cedar Pocket; and Burnett Creek which is subverted by the Maroon Dam west of Rathdowney. The river descends over its course.
In addition to the Scenic Rim, the Logan and its tributaries drain more than including the northern parts of the Border Ranges, the western slopes of the McPherson Range and the eastern slopes of the Main Range. The river&#x27;s upper catchment is heavily influenced by the national parks of Tamborine, Mount Barney, Moogerah Peaks, Main Range and the Lamington Plateau, and numerous local government-owned reserves and conservation areas, that comprise part of the Shield Volcano Group of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia.

The river is crossed by the Mount Lindesay Highway near Rathdowney and at via Maclean&#x27;s Bridge. The river is also crossed by the Pacific Motorway and the Old Pacific Highway south of . The Beenleigh railway line crosses the Logan between Loganlea and Bethania. A second rail crossing is planned to accommodate a doubling of rail tracks between the Kuraby and Beenleigh in time for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. Tidal waters reach to just downstream of the Maclean&#x27;s Bridge.

==Water harvesting==
Maroon Dam subverts Burnnett Creek, and supplies water to the Beaudesert Shire. Maroon is managed by SunWater and covers approximately . The Queensland Government has considered several projects to supply water to its &quot;Southern Regional Pipeline&quot;. The Bromelton off-stream storage facility is under construction on the Logan River, outside Beaudesert, as is the Cedar Grove Weir, near Jimboomba. In 2006 the Queensland Government decided against the construction of a Logan River dam at Tilley&#x27;s Bridge in Rathdowney due to mounting public pressure and high road diversion costs. Instead, the Wyaralong Dam was proposed on Teviot Brook near Boonah which will inundate fifteen properties instead of the one hundred properties for the Tilley&#x27;s Bridge site. The Tilley&#x27;s Bridge dam, if it had been approved, would have inundated the area of land between Tilley&#x27;s Bridge, just to the south of Rathdowney, and Bigriggan Camping Reserve (), some west, covering a significant section of the Boonah-Rathdowney Road.

==History==
The Yugambeh clan of the Jagera people are thought to have once roamed throughout the catchment. Traditional owners in the catchment made use of the abundant natural resources, various plants and animals were used as staple foods as the seasons changed and as new food sources became available. They called the river &quot;Dugulumba&quot; in their traditional Yugambeh dialect of the Bandjalang language. Yugembah (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages in areas that include the Beenleigh, Beaudesert, Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Albert River, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama, Tamborine and Tweed River Valley, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley.

Mununjali (also known as Mananjahli, Manaldjahli and Manandjali) is a dialect of the Yugambeh language. The Mununjali language area includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Scenic Rim and Beaudesert Shire Councils.

In August 1826 Captain Patrick Logan was the first European to discover the river. Logan initially named the river the Darling River, but to avoid confusion, Governor Ralph Darling ordered the name be changed to honour its discoverer. A run at Bromelton was the first property along the river to be settled in 1842 by Hugh Henry Robertson. By 1850 the property had transferred hands to Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior. Rosa Campbell Praed, one of Queensland&#x27;s first novelists spent time at the property and wrote about station life in detail in a 1902 book titled &quot;My Australian Girlhood&quot;.

Boat traffic was thriving along the river by the 1860s mostly because it was the best transport route in the area. Steam ships, cutters and hand-loaded punts were the most common vessels.

For navigation purposes the river was surveyed in 1871 from its mouth upstream to McLean. Wharfs were initially built at McLean, Beenleigh, Waterford and Logan Village with more built due to public demand. Unofficial ferry crossings were conducted as early as 1862. Long-term services were established at Alberton, Loganholme and Waterford. The rail bridge at Loganlea was operating in 1885 only to be demolished two years later during floods. A new bridge opened in 1888 and lasted until 1972 when another bridge was built.

In 1905, a saltwater crocodile was found shot dead floating near the ferry by banks of the river. The find was preceded by reports of sightings for several years which were met with scepticism because southern Queensland is well south of their natural distribution.

A toll bridge on the river north of Beenleigh was opened and began collecting tolls in 1931, as weekend traffic between Brisbane and the Gold Coast increased.

The worst flooding in the lower reaches of the river in the 20th century occurred during the 1974 Brisbane flood.

==Water quality and conservation==

The quality of the water in the Logan River is very turbid. The annual Healthy Waterways Report Card for the waterways and catchments of South East Queensland in 2007 rated the condition of the Logan River as very poor. Much of the environmental degradation has been caused by land clearing, the Bromelton Industrial Estate, nutrient run-off, and pumping wastewater directly from several wastewater treatment plants in and around the Logan River. In 2009, the Healthy Waterways Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program rated the River&#x27;s freshwater area at a &quot;D&quot;; its Estuarine area was given an &quot;F&quot;.
Historically, cholera has been found in the Logan River from around 1977.
Community projects in the Logan catchment area aim to improve the quality of the ecosystem. Competitions such as &quot;Carp-busters&quot; are aimed at reducing the number of carp and hence allowing native species of fish a better chance of survival.

<text>William Willoughby Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen, (25 January 180712 November 1886) styled by the courtesy title Viscount Cole until 1840, was an Irish palaeontologist and Conservative Member of Parliament. He also served as the first Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Order from 1866 until his death. He was Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland from 1846 until his death.

Cole was born into the Ulster branch of &#x27;the Ascendancy&#x27;, the Anglo-Irish aristocracy. He was the son of John Willoughby Cole, 2nd Earl of Enniskillen and his wife, Lady Charlotte Paget. Lord Cole was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford. In his youth he began to devote his leisure to the study and collection of fossil fishes, with his friend Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 10th Bt, and amassed a fine collection at Florence Court, his home just south-west of Enniskillen. This included many specimens that were described and figured by Agassiz and Egerton. This collection was subsequently acquired by the British Museum, and now resides at the Natural History Museum, London.

==Political career==
Lord Enniskillen was also involved in politics and represented (as Lord Cole) Fermanagh in the House of Commons between 1831 and 1840, when he succeeded his father, to become the third Earl of Enniskillen, and entered the House of Lords as Baron Grinstead. In Dublin, he was a member of the Kildare Street Club.

<text>Kitab al-I&#x27;tibar (, &quot;The Book of Learning by Example&quot;) is the autobiography of Usama ibn-Munqidh, an Arab Syrian diplomat, soldier of the 12th century, hunter, poet and nobleman.

The book was first discovered in 1880 in the Real Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial (San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Madrid, Spain). It exists as 134 folios with the first 21 pages missing and is considered a copy of a copy of the original made in July 1213. However it remains the only version available to date.

Hartwig Derenbourg (1844-1908) was the first to mention the manuscript in his three volumes book &quot;Les manuscrits arabes de l&#x27;Escurial&quot; (1884-1903) and his book &quot;Ousama ibn Mounkidh, un émir syrien&quot; (1889) when he studied, transcribed and published the work. Philip K. Hitti (1886 – 1978) added to his work in his publication &quot;An Arab-Syrian Gentlemen in the Period of the Crusades: Memoirs of Usamah ibn-Munqidh&quot;, with the latest edition published in 2000 by Columbia University Press.

Usamah&#x27;s autobiography is part of the literary genre known as &quot;adab&quot; which aims at &quot;pleasing, diverting and titilating&quot; its readers, as well as instructing them. Philip K. Hitti, in the introduction to his translation, describes the work as superior to other Arabic biographies. According to him, &quot;It gives us a glimpse into Syrian methods of warfare, hawking and medication, and ushers us into the intimacies of Moslem court life as well as private home life.&quot;. It also offers an insight into the mindset of Arabic knights as they interacted with the crusaders as friends, fought against them as enemies and on matters of religion and politics.

== Islamic society in the 12th century ==

Much of the autobiography addresses the material culture of the time. It describes wealthier society members, including their houses, clothes and valued possessions. There is much detail on military society as Usama was involved in many battles against Christians and fellow Muslims, including attitudes towards the Christian crusaders. It provides an idea of the internal political structure as Usama served under the Fatimid court in Egypt and under Nur al-Din. Usama provides information on medical practices, religion and hunting.

=== Material culture ===

When Usama moves to Egypt in 1144 the caliph provided him with a place to reside, which he describes:

The autobiography gives evidence of textiles and clothing: &quot;He [Al-Malik al-&#x27;Adil] put at my disposal six thousand Egyptian dinars, a camel load of Dabiqi clothes, of ciclatoum, of squirrel-furred gowns, of Dimyati brocade, and of turbans.&quot;

Dabiqi cloth was linen, sometimes interwoven with gold and silk, ciclatoun was another precious cloth. Dimyati brocade was a white linen or silk with added gold threads. Usama describes the things that were plundered from his home when he had to flee from it: &quot;From the hall of my home they carried away forty huge camel bags all sewn up and containing great quantities of silver, gold and clothing, and from my stable they marched away thirty-six horses and female saddle mules&quot;

Usama describes another time when his possessions were stolen when his family are returning from Egypt. On their journey, the King of Jerusalem took all their valuable possessions: &quot;...jewellery, which had been entrusted to the women, clothes, gems, swords, weapons and gold and silver amounting to about thirty thousand dinars.&quot;

The most significant loss for Usama were his 4,000 books. Books would be a very valuable item in the era before printing as they must be transcribed by hand (by a scribe) and only the wealthy would be able to afford them. Usama can cope with the loss of his other possessions but could never forget the loss of his books: &quot;Their loss has left a heartsore that will stay with me to the last day of my life&quot;.

In the militarized society of the time, war spoils were highly valued. They demonstrated prestige as only the rich elite could afford them. For example, Usama describes a quilted gold saddle he owned. He suggests that only someone of his status could afford such an item: &quot;Read what is on it. Is it&#x27; Abbas &#x27; name and his son&#x27;s, or is it my name? And who else in the days of al-Hafiz could ride in Egypt on a gold saddle but I?&quot;

=== Political structure of Islamic society ===

After getting into trouble with his uncle who ruled Shayzar, Usama was exiled, traveling to Damascus, Jerusalem, Cairo, Mosul and Mecca. Usama was in the army of the Atabeg Zengi, went to the Fatimid court in Egypt and was in the army of Nur al-Din. The political structure of the area changed considerably during Usama&#x27;s lifetime. The Islamic world was very fragmented and divided at the time, between the Abbasid caliphate of Baghdad and the Fatimid caliphate based on Cairo. By the late 11th century neither caliph held any real power and autonomous rulers were establishing themselves. In reality, the three great powers at the end of the 11th century were the Great Seljuk Sultanate, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and the Fatimid Caliphate which was ruled by a military wazirate. By the end of his life, however, Syria and Egypt were united under Saladin and had re-conquered most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from the crusaders.

The Fatimite court was full of conspiracies and feuds. Usama shows how the power of the caliph was limited by the military rulers and how the instability of the government caused feuds and assassinations For example, in 1150 the Fatimite caliph tried to kill his vizier:

&quot;Al-Zafir [the caliph] now planned to put al-Adil (his vizier) to death. He concerted with a group of young men from his special bodyguard, together with others whom he won over to the scheme by distributing money among them, that they attack al-Adil in his home and put him to death.&quot;

Another instance is when al-Adil is killed by Nasr ibn Abbas, and Ibn Abbas&#x27; father (Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh) becomes the vizier.

&quot;When al-Adil had gone to sleep, that prefect notified Ibn Abbas who, with six of his attendants, made an assault upon him in the house in which he was sleeping and killed him.&quot;

Also revealed is the corruption and bribery that went on. Usama gives the example of when the caliph tried to persuade Ibn Abbas to kill his father so that he would succeed to become vizier. The caliph bribes him to do this:

&quot;He received twenty trays of silver holding twenty thousand dinars. After neglecting him for a few days, the caliph sent him an assortment of clothing of all kinds. ..&quot;

Ibn Abbas, however tells his father about the plot and they decide to kill the Caliph:

&quot;Nasr invited the caliph to come to his residence. ..after having installed a band of followers on one side of the house. As soon as the caliph was seated, the band rushed upon him and killed him&quot;

== Attitudes towards the west ==

The autobiography gives us details of Muslim attitudes towards the Christian crusaders who went to the Middle East. His views of the Franks can reveal the impression Muslims had at the time about the nature of their own society compared to the Franks&#x27; society, for example when he describes the lack of jealousy in sexual affairs. Hitti points out that to a conservative Muslim this must have seemed shocking. Another example is his ridicule of the Frankish system of justice. He gives a couple of examples; The first is a description of a duel to settle a dispute and the second is a man being dropped into a cask of water. If the man drowned he was innocent and if he floated he was guilty:

&quot;This man did his best to sink when they dropped him into the water, but he could not do it. So he had to submit to their sentence against him -may Allah&#x27;s curse be upon them!&quot; 

This would have contrasted dramatically with the contemporary Muslim judicial procedure. Usama views Islamic society and learning as superior to that of the Franks. For example, when a Frankish knight offers to take his son to his country to educate him in wisdom and chivalry, he refuses:

&quot;Thus there fell upon my ears words which would never come out of the head of a sensible man; for even if my son were to be taken captive, his captivity could not bring him a worse misfortune than carrying him into the lands of the Franks.&quot;

He also criticises their medicine, giving an example of an amputation, which killed a patient, however he follows this up with examples of some successful medical cures the Franks practiced.

Usama describes the Franks as &#x27;animals possessing the virtues of courage and fighting, but nothing else&#x27;. Despite this however, Usama became friends with one Frankish knight who he describes as a:

&quot;Reverend knight who had just arrived from their land in order to make the holy pilgrimage and then return home. He was of my intimate fellowship and kept such constant company with me that he began to call me &quot;my brother&quot;. Between us were mutual bonds of amity and friendship.&quot;

This attitude towards the Christians reflects Islamic society at the time. The Muslims were willing to co-operate with the Franks. Muslim rulers often made alliances with the Crusader states in their own internal struggles against fellow Muslims.
There is a difference in the attitude to Franks who were new to the area and those who had been there for a long time. The Franks who have lived there a while have got used to the customs of Islamic society while the newcomers are more hostile:

&quot;Everyone who is a fresh emigrant from the Frankish lands is ruder in character than those who have become acclimatized and have held long associations with the Muslims&quot;

== Medical practices ==

Usama gives us details of medical practices by mentioning medical cures he has witnessed. For example, someone who had lost his speech because of dust in his throat from sifting. He was given vinegar by a physician and cured:

&quot;He drank it and took his seat for an instant, after which he felt nauseated and began to vomit clay in abundance, mixed with the vinegar that he had drunk. Consequently his throat became open again and his speech normal.&quot;

Another example is when Usama is suffering from a cold; he is given an Indian melon which cures him: &#x27;no sooner had I finished eating it than I began to perspire and the cold which I felt disappeared&#x27;.

Arab doctors were also good at bone setting, as well as stitching, Usama describes one man whose face was struck with a sword which:

&quot;Cut through his eyebrow, eyelid, cheek, nose and upper lip, making the whole side of his face hang down on his chest. ..his face was stitched and his cut was treated until he was healed and returned to his former condition.&quot;

Usama is often quoted out of context to &quot;prove&quot; Arab medicine as superior to that of the Franks in his time. He gives an example of the difference between Thabit, a Christian [Arab] physician sent by Usama&#x27;s uncle with that of a Frankish physician. Thabit describes his method of treatment:

&quot;They brought before me a knight in whose leg an abscess had grown; and a woman afflicted with imbecility .To the knight I applied a small poultice until the abscess opened and became well; and the woman I put on a diet and made her humour wet.&quot;

In contrast, the Frankish physician amputated the knight&#x27;s leg causing him to die on the spot, and to the woman, he diagnosed that she had been possessed by a devil and made an incision in her skull which also killed the woman.

However, Usama also describes examples of successful Frankish medicine. He describes the treatment given to a knight by a Frankish physician:

&quot;A horse kicked him in the leg, which was subsequently infected and which opened in fourteen different places. Every time one of these cuts would close in one place, another would open in another place...Then came to him a Frankish physician and removed from the leg all the ointments which were on it and began to wash it with very strong vinegar. By this treatment all the cuts were healed and the man became well again&quot;

He gives another example of a boy whose neck was affected with scrofula. A Frank noticed the boy and advised the boy&#x27;s father on how to cure him:

&quot;Take uncrushed leaves of glasswort, burn them, then soak the ashes in olive oil and sharp vinegar. Treat the scrofula with them until the spot on which it is growing is eaten up. Then take burnt lead, soak it in ghee butter and treat him with it. That will cure him. The father treated the boy accordingly, and the boy was cured. The sores closed and the boy returned to his normal condition of health. I have myself treated with this medicine many who were afflicted with such disease, and the treatment was successful in removing the cause of the complaint&quot;.

Usama is quoting his uncle, who is quoting said Tabith, on the example of fatal Frankish practices, whereas he himself has positive experience with, been taught, and recommends Frankish medicinal practices. Also, death following an amputation due to an abscess is the same treatment, and fate, suffered by the Ayyubid Sultan as-Salih Ayyub in 1249, miles from any Frankish physician.

== Warfare ==

Usama gives us a record of how warfare was conducted. One of the main themes of the book is that the outcome of warfare is pre-determined: &#x27;Victory in warfare is from Allah...and is not due to organisation and planning nor to the number of troops and supporters., He describes how discipline was maintained while marching through enemy territory:

&quot;...making our stops at the call of the bugle and starting again at the call of the bugle.&quot;

Siege warfare was much more common than open battles; Usama describes the practice of mining, digging a tunnel under a castle and then setting light to the wooden supports so the tunnel would collapse taking the tower of the castle with it.

Usama also gives us information on the sort of armour and arms that were used. The lance was a very important weapon; Usama describes using lances in the battle of Kafartab:

&quot;We dislodged from them eighteen knights, of whom some received lance blows and died, others received lance blows and fell off their horses and died, and still others received lance blows which fell on their horses and became footmen.&quot;

The sword was also a high status weapon. Usama describes how his father&#x27;s sword cut through his groom&#x27;s outfit while it was still in its sheath:

&quot;The sword cut through the outfit, the silver sandal, a mantle and a wooden shawl which the groom had on, and then cut through the bone of his elbow. The whole forearm fell off.&quot;

The sword was subsequently named after his father&#x27;s groom.

== Hunting ==

Usama devotes a section of his book to his hunting experiences. He describes the hunting practice of Zengi:

&quot;The falconers would proceed ahead of us with the falcons which would be flown at the waterfowl. The drums would be beaten in accordance with the prevailing custom. The falcons would catch whatever birds they could. ..&quot;

He also describes hunting partridges with his father:

&quot;My father would draw near the sleeping partridge and throw at it a stick from his hand. The moment the Partridge was flushed he would throw off al- Yahshiir (the falcon), who would seize it. ..The falconer would then descend to it, slay the bird...&quot;

The falconer had to slay the bird himself as it was forbidden by the Qur&#x27;an to eat anything which is killed by a blow. Usama also describes a system of hunting using sakers:

&quot;At first should be sent the leader which, striking a gazelle, binds on its ear. The auxiliary is sent after the leader, and hits another gazelle...The leader, now clutching the gazelle by its ear, isolates it from the herd.&quot;

== Conclusion ==

Usama&#x27;s autobiography can show a lot about various aspects of Islamic society during the 12th century, and the material culture as well as the political and religious customs of the time. It reveals the fragmented and disunited nature of
the Muslim world and the internal divisions and rivalries.

<doc id="937408" wikidata="Q7191202" url="?curid=937408" title="Picture plane">
<text>In painting, photography, graphical perspective and descriptive geometry, a picture plane is an image plane located between the &quot;eye point&quot; (or &quot;oculus&quot;) and the object being viewed and is usually coextensive to the material surface of the work. It is ordinarily a vertical plane perpendicular to the sightline to the object of interest.

==Features==
In the technique of graphical perspective the picture plane has several features:
:Given are an eye point O (from &quot;oculus&quot;), a horizontal plane of reference called the &quot;ground plane&quot; γ and a picture plane π... The line of intersection of π and γ is called the &quot;ground line&quot; and denoted &quot;GR&quot;. ... the orthogonal projection of O upon π is called the &quot;principal vanishing point P&quot;...The line through &quot;P&quot; parallel to the ground line is called the &quot;horizon&quot; HZ
The horizon frequently features vanishing points of lines appearing parallel in the foreground.
==Position==
The orientation of the picture plane is always perpendicular of the axis that comes straight out of your eyes. For example, if you are looking to a building that is in front of you and your eyesight is entirely horizontal then the picture plane is perpendicular to the ground and to the axis of your sight.

If you are looking up or down, then the picture plane remains perpendicular to your sight and it changes the 90 degrees angle compared to the ground. When this happens a third vanishing point will appear in most cases depending on what you are seeing (or drawing).

==Cut of an eject==
G. B. Halsted included the picture plane in his book &quot;Synthetic Projective Geometry&quot;:
&quot;To &#x27;project&#x27; from a fixed point &quot;M&quot; (the &#x27;projection vertex&#x27;) a figure, the &#x27;original&#x27;, composed of points &quot;B, C, D&quot; etc. and straights &quot;b, c, d&quot; etc., is to construct the &#x27;projecting straights&#x27; formula_1 and the &#x27;projecting planes&#x27; formula_2 Thus is obtained a new figure composed of straights and planes, all on M, and called an &#x27;eject&#x27; of the original.&quot;

&quot;To &#x27;cut&#x27; by a fixed plane μ (the picture-plane) a figure, the &#x27;subject&#x27; made up of planes β, γ, δ, etc., and straights &quot;b, c, d&quot;, etc., is to construct the meets formula_3 and passes formula_4 Thus is obtained a new figure composed of straights and points, all on μ, and called a &#x27;cut&#x27; of the subject. If the subject is an eject of an original, the cut of the subject is an &#x27;image&#x27; of the original.

== Integrity of the picture plane ==
A well-known phrase has accompanied many discussions of painting during the period of modernism. Coined by the influential art critic Clement Greenberg in his essay called &quot;Modernist Painting&quot;, the phrase &quot;integrity of the picture plane&quot; has come to denote how the flat surface of the physical painting functions in older as opposed to more recent works. That phrase is found in the following sentence in his essay:

&quot;The Old Masters had sensed that it was necessary to preserve what is called the integrity of the picture plane: that is, to signify the enduring presence of flatness underneath and above the most vivid illusion of three-dimensional space.&quot;

Greenberg seems to be referring to the way painting relates to the picture plane in both the modern period and the &quot;Old Master&quot; period.

<text>Franz Ritter von Hauer, or Franz von Hauer (30 January 1822 – 20 March 1899) was an Austrian geologist.

==Biography==
Hauer was born in Vienna, the son of Joseph von Hauer (1778-1863), who was equally distinguished as a high Austrian official and authority on finance and as a palaeontologist.

He studied geology at the mining academy of Schemnitz (1839-1843), and for a time was engaged in official mining work in Styria. In 1846, he became assistant to Wilhelm von Haidinger at the mineralogical museum in Vienna; three years later he joined the imperial geological institute, and in 1866 he was appointed director. In 1886, he became superintendent of the Imperial Natural History Museum in Vienna.

Among his special geological works are those on the &quot;Cephalopoda&quot; of the Triassic and Jurassic formations of Alpine regions (1855-1856). he recognized and discovered 89 species and established the Middle and Late Triassic stratigraphical units of deep shelf environments. His most important general work was that of the &quot;Geological Map of Austro-Hungary&quot;, in twelve sheets (1867-1871; 4th ed. 1884, including Bosnia and Montenegro). This map was accompanied by a series of explanatory pamphlets.

In 1874, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. In 1882, he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. He was also elected as the foreign correspondent of the Geological Society of London. In 1892, von Hauer became a life-member of the upper house (&quot;Herrenhaus&quot;) of the Austrian parliament.

The mineral Hauerite is named after the two von Hauers.

<text>André &quot;Dédé&quot; Fortin (; 17 November 1962 – 8 May 2000) was a founding member, frontman, and guitarist of the Québécois band Les Colocs, formed in 1990.

Born in rural Quebec, André &quot;Dédé&quot; Fortin was the tenth of eleven children. After studying cinema at the Université de Montréal, he formed the folk-rock band Les Colocs in 1990. The band&#x27;s music addressed serious issues such as poverty, loss of community, and drug dependence. Fortin was also an activist for Quebec sovereignty, campaigning for the &quot;Yes&quot; side in the 1995 Quebec referendum. The last LP from Les Colocs, Dehors Novembre, won the Félix Award for Rock Album of the Year.

Fortin struggled with depression and died by suicide in 2000. His legacy includes the renaming of a street in his hometown, a biographical film, and the Fondation Andre Dédé Fortin, which focuses on depression education and suicide prevention.

==Early life==
Fortin was born to Alfred Fortin and Gisèle Tremblay on a farm near the small village of Saint-Thomas-Didyme, in the rural Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec. He was the tenth of eleven children. When he was eight, the family moved to Normandin, but he always valued his childhood home. Fortin attended public schools and studied cinema at the Université de Montréal with his friend Éric Henry.

==Les Colocs==
Fortin was long interested in music and started writing song lyrics. In 1990, he formed Les Colocs, after meeting Patrick Esposito Di Napoli and a couple of the other band members. The music they wrote, recorded and performed was a folk rock sound, emerging from Québécois music, with ska back beats and several other genres of music. They released their first album in 1993 to great acclaim. Les Colocs&#x27; festive melodies often hid more serious issues which Fortin addressed in his lyrics, such as poverty (&quot;Passe-moé la puck&quot;), loss of community (&quot;La rue principale&quot;), emotional dependence (&quot;Juste une p&#x27;tite nuite&quot;), and drug dependence (&quot;Tassez-vous de d&#x27;là&quot;). During this period Fortin was instrumental in the making of several Félix Award-winning music videos for Les Colocs.

Fortin was a passionate believer in and activist for Quebec sovereignty. He campaigned for the OUI (&quot;Yes&quot;) side during the run-up to the 1995 Quebec referendum, and his band Les Colocs performed at partisan meetings. He was deeply affected by the 1994 death due to AIDS-related complications of bandmate and friend Patrick Esposito Di Napoli, and Fortin struggled with depression in the ensuing years.

&quot;Dehors Novembre&quot; (1998), the last LP from the group, was written and performed with the help of the Diouf brothers, whose background from Senegal added a new element to the band&#x27;s music. It has become Fortin and the band&#x27;s most celebrated work, and it won the Félix Award for the Rock Album of the Year.

==Death and legacy==
On 8 May 2000, Fortin died by suicide at his apartment. The day before, the Colocs manager Raymond Paquin had received a poem by Fortin. He published it posthumously in &quot;La Presse.&quot; Several years later, the remaining members of the band recovered a CD with the original song recorded from this poem by Dédé himself; they made their own version, which they released in 2009. For days afterwards, fans left flowers and messages in his memory at his building on Rachel Street, in the Plateau neighborhood of Montreal.

Fortin has been remembered in different ways:
*Saint-Thomas-Didyme, where Fortin was born, renamed Rang Saint-Henri as &quot;Chemin Dédé-Fortin&quot; in his honor in 2006.
*In 2009, a film about Fortin&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;Through the Mist (Dédé à travers les brumes)&quot;, was released, starring Sébastien Ricard as Fortin.
*The Fondation Andre Dédé Fortin was established to educate about depression and prevent suicides; it has established a 24-hour crisis line and conducts workshops to help people in need.
*A bande-dessinée (graphic novel) Dédé, illustrated by Christian Quesnel.

<text>Wilhelm Karl Ritter von Haidinger (or Wilhelm von Haidinger, or most often Wilhelm Haidinger) (5 February 179519 March 1871) was an Austrian mineralogist.

==Early life==

Haidinger&#x27;s father was the mineralogist Karl Haidinger (1756–1797), who died when Wilhelm was only two years old. The books on mineralogy and the collection of rocks and minerals of his father almost certainly had raised the interest of young Wilhelm. The collection of his uncle, banker Jakob Friedrich van der Nüll, was by far larger and much more precious, even to such a degree that famous professor Friedrich Mohs of Freiberg (Germany) had been asked to describe it in detail. Young Wilhelm Haidinger and the professor often met in the house of Wilhelm&#x27;s uncle. After completing the &quot;Normalschule&quot; and the &quot;Grammatikalschule&quot;, Wilhelm started out his preacademical training at the local &quot;Gymnasium&quot;. However, after completing only his first year, the &quot;Humanitätsclasse&quot;, Wilhelm (now 17 years old) was asked by professor Friedrich Mohs to join him as his assistant at the newly founded Universalmuseum Joanneum in Graz.

==Scientific career==
During the next five years in Graz and the following six years in Freiberg, Wilhelm Haidinger remained a devoted assistant and admirer of professor Friedrich Mohs. During these years Haidinger became more and more involved in scientific work. In 1821 Wilhelm Haidinger published his first scientific paper: &quot;On the crystallisation of copper-pyrites&quot; in the &quot;Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society&quot; (Edinburgh), volume 4, pp. 1–18. This paper formed the start of a grand total of some 350 scientific publications, all of which are listed in volume 3 of the &quot;Catalogue of Scientific Papers (1800–1863)&quot; and volume 10 of the same catalogue for the years 1864–1883. Apart from all these papers, Wilhelm Haidinger published several books: , an account on the collection of the &quot;k. k. Hofkammer im Münz- und Bergwesen&quot;; a review of mineralogical research (which grew into a well-known series edited by Gustav Adolph Kenngott); his &quot;&quot;; an atlas to this textbook on mineralogy and the first complete geological map of Austria-Hungary.

In 1822, Wilhelm Haidinger accompanied August Graf von Breunner-Enckevoirt (1796–1877) on a six-month trip; they traveled from Linz to Munich, Basel, Paris, London, and Edinburgh. In Edinburgh, banker Thomas Allan provided Haidinger with the means to translate Mohs&#x27; into English. (The translation appeared in 1823 in three volumes: &quot;Treatise on Mineralogy&quot;.)

In 1823, Haidinger left Freiberg to resettle in Edinburgh, where he stayed until the summer of 1825. In Edinburgh, Haidinger met mineralogists Robert Jameson and Robert Ferguson of Raith, geologist James Hall, chemists Thomas Thomson and Edward Turner, and physicist David Brewster. The years in Edinburgh are among Haidinger&#x27;s most productive: The translation of the comprehensive textbook by Mohs appeared in print and 33 scientific papers were written and published (in, for example, &quot;The Edinburgh Journal of Science&quot; of David Brewster and in the &quot;Philosophical Journal&quot; of Robert Jameson). While in Edinburgh Haidinger&#x27;s friend Pierre Berthier named a new mineral (an iron antimony sulfide) &quot;Haidingérite&quot;.

==Return to Austria==

A long journey with Robert Allan (the son of Thomas Allan) in 1825 and 1826 brought Wilhelm Haidinger to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Austria, and northern Italy. He spent the winter months of 1825 and 1826 in the highest scientific circles of Berlin, where he met, for example, Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose, Friedrich Wöhler, Eilhard Mitscherlich, Heinrich Gustav Magnus, and Johann Christian Poggendorff. In the spring of 1826, the journey was continued and visits to Friedrich Mohs in Freiberg, to Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann and Friedrich Stromeyer in Göttingen, Hermann von Meyer in Frankfurt, Carl Cäsar Ritter von Leonhard and Leopold Gmelin in Heidelberg, Christian Gmelin and Franz von Kobell in Munich, and Franz Xaver Riepl in Vienna completed their trip.

In 1827, Wilhelm Haidinger returned to Austria and became one of the directors of the &quot;Erste (böhmische) Porzellan-Industrie Aktien Gesellschaft (Epiag)&quot; in Elbogen (now Loket, Czech Republic). Working in the ceramics factory owned by his brothers Eugen and Rudolf did not prevent Wilhelm from continuing his mineralogical research and writing scientific papers.From 1827 to 1840, Haidinger published some 24 papers (according to the &quot;Catalogue of Scientific Papers&quot;), which appeared in such well-known journals as &quot;Poggendorff&#x27;s Annalen&quot; and the . One of the papers described the occurrence of fossil plants in the brown coal and sandstones of the surroundings of Elbogen (Loket).

In 1840, Haidinger moved to Vienna to succeed his tutor Friedrich Mohs as director of the mineralogical collection of the &quot;Kaiserlich-Königlichen Hofkammer im Münz- und Bergwesen&quot;. How much Haidinger devoted himself to science in general is evident from the fact that he founded a nongovernmental scientific society: the &quot;Freunde der Naturwissenschaften in Wien&quot;. Becker, in 1871, recalled how Haidinger had been able to organize his scientific society in spite of serious opposition from the Austrian police. Haidinger, founder and president of the &quot;Freunde der Naturwissenschaften in Wien&quot; undertook to publish its proceedings from 1840 to 1850. The last meeting of the &quot;Freunde der Naturwissenschaften in Wien&quot; took place on 29 November 1850. After that, the learned society ceased to exist. In addition to his work on the collections of the mineralogical museum and his lectures on mineralogy and geology to young mining engineers, Wilhem Haidinger found the time to continue his own research and published some 105 papers from 1849 to 1860.

==Dolomitization==
Haidinger&#x27;s scientific work became increasingly concentrated on the phenomenon of &quot;pseudomorphosis&quot;, that is, minerals that have taken up the outer aspect of another mineral. For example, anhydrite would have changed into gypsum, but the original cleavage planes and crystal habitus would give the impression of anhydrite. Another example given by Haidinger was that of calcium carbonate, which would readily change into calcium magnesium carbonate (dolomite). In his own words: 
... part of the carbonate of lime is replaced by carbonate of magnesia, so as to form in the new species a compound of one atom each. How this change was brought about, is a difficult question to resolve, though the fact cannot be doubted, as we have in the specimen described a demonstration of it, approaching in certainty almost to ocular evidence.

To geologists, Haidinger is known especially for his postulate of the &quot;dolomitization&quot; reaction that would change calcium carbonate into dolomite at low temperatures (below 100 °C). A solution of magnesium sulfate would convert calcium carbonate into dolomite plus calcium sulfate in solution. Nonetheless in 1844, Haidinger related how his friends, well-known chemists Friedrich Wöhler, Eilhard Mitscherlich, and Leopold Gmelin, had explained to him that powdered dolomite will react, even at room temperature, with a solution of calcium sulfate to give calcium carbonate plus a solution of magnesium sulfate. (&quot;Durch meinem verehrten Freund Wöhler wurde ich auf die Beobachtung, die auch Mitscherlich und L. Gmelin anführen, aufmerksam gemacht, daß man Dolomit in Pulverform künstlich zerlegen kann, wenn man eine Auflösung von Gyps durch denselben dringen läßt. Bittersalz wird gebildet und kohlensaurer Kalk bleibt zurück. Dieser Versuch erläutert wohle mit hinreichender Evidenz die Bildung des Kalkspathes aus Dolomit bei unserer gewöhnlichen Temperatur und atmosphärischer Pressung&quot;: Haidinger, 1844, p. 250.) Haidinger&#x27;s employee at the &quot;Kaiserlich-Königlichen Hofkammer im Münz- und Bergwesen&quot;, Adolph von Morlot, undertook to investigate the formation of dolomite in the laboratory (no doubt at the request of Haidinger). The outcome of the experiments confirmed what Friedrich Wöhler had predicted in 1843; dolomite does not form from calcium carbonate plus a solution of magnesium sulfate unless high temperatures (more than 200° Reamur = 250 °C) and high pressures were applied. Von Morlot used calcite powder soaked in a concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate sealed in a glass tube. Heating the glass tube in an oil bath increased the pressure inside it to at least 15 bar. The glass tube was able to withstand this high pressure only because it had been placed inside a gun barrel filled with sand. In this way, Von Morlot in 1847 had clearly demonstrated the existence of a minimum temperature for the synthesis of the mineral dolomite. When Von Morlot (1847 A) reacted dolomite powder with a concentrated solution of calcium sulfate at room temperature, the result was (solid) calcium carbonate plus a solution of magnesium sulfate. (&quot;Wenn man nämlich durch gepulverten Dolomit eine Auflösung von Gyps filtriert, so entsteht die umgekehrte doppelte Zersetzung in der Art, daß Bittersalz aufgelöst durch&#x27;s Filtrum geht, während kohlensaurer Kalk zurück bleibt&quot;: Von Morlot, 1847 A, p. 309.)

==Moral standards==
Ritter von Hauer (1871), in his necrology of Wilhelm Haidinger, recalled with great pride how open-minded Haidinger had been. The very thought of censoring any scientific publication would have been alien to him. In this regard, it must be remembered how Wilhelm Haidinger had allowed Adolph von Morlot to publish his accounts on the laboratory syntheses of dolomite first and foremost in Haidinger&#x27;s own &quot;Berichte über die Mittheilungen von Freunden der Naturwissenschaften in Wien&quot; (at the same time Morlot&#x27;s paper on the synthesis of dolomite appeared in four other well-known journals.)

As part of his mineralogical research, Haidinger studied the optical behaviour of minerals, which led to his discovery of the phenomenon of pleochroïsm.

A major step in Haidinger&#x27;s career took place in 1849 - the founding of the &quot;Kaiserlich-Königliche geologische Reichs-Anstalt&quot; on 15 November 1849 in Vienna. Haidinger became its first director. The &quot;k. k. Hofkammer im Münz- und Bergwesen&quot; now became part of this newly founded geological office of Imperial Austria-Hungary. A detailed account of all events in relation with this major reorganization was published by Haidinger in 1864. Details of Haidinger&#x27;s years as director of the Austrian geological survey were published by Haidinger&#x27;s successor Franz Ritter von Hauer.

Little or no doubt can remain as to the scientific status that Wilhelm Haidinger achieved from 1850 to 1866: the &quot;Kaiserlich-Königliche Geologische Reichsanstalt&quot; became the epicentre of geological research of its time. Haidinger&#x27;s unselfish attitude is best reflected in his motto: &quot;Förderung der Wissenschaft, nicht Monopolisirung der Arbeit&quot; (Advancement of science, not monopolisation of research).

==Political activity==
According to Döll (1871), Wilhelm Haidinger played a major role in the founding of the &quot;k. k. Geographischen Gesellschaft zu Wien&quot; (Becker, 1871 mentions how Haidinger had started the Austrian Geographical Society after the example of the famous Royal Geographical Society of London); the &quot;Werner-Verein zur geologischen Durchforschung Mährens und Schlesiens&quot;, the &quot;Geologischer Verein für Ungarn&quot; in Pest, the &quot;Società Geologica&quot; in Milan, Italy, and its successor the &quot;Società Italiana di Scienze naturali&quot;. Haidinger remained convinced that such scientific organizations outside the official governmental societies were necessary, if not essential.

In 1860 Wilhelm Haidinger read in the &quot;Wiener-Zeitung&quot; that his &quot;k. k. Geologischer Reichsanstalt&quot; was going to be incorporated into the &quot;Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot;. Haidinger was shocked, not only because he had to read this news in the paper, but especially because the two institutes were truly incompatible. After several months of great uncertainty, the Imperial government, the &quot;Reichsrath&quot;, decided to cancel the planned forceful unification. Thus, Haidinger was able to continue his work at the Imperial Geological Survey. With considerable pride Wilhelm Haidinger related, how Emperor Franz-Josef of Austria-Hungary had visited the building of the &quot;k. k. Geologischer Reichsanstalt&quot; in Vienna on 15 February 1862. In 1866, Wilhelm Haidinger became seriously ill and asked the government for early retirement; it was generously granted. After retirement, he continued his studies at home, when meteorites held his main interest (and several papers followed).

==Awards and honours==
Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary bestowed great honour onto Wilhelm Haidinger: the Order of Franz Joseph and the Order of Leopold with his elevation to knighthood (&quot;Ritter von Haidinger&quot;) on 30 July 1864. Haidinger had received from the King of Prussia on 24 January 1857 the highly coveted civil version of the &quot;Königlich Preußischer Orden&quot; &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.Wilhelm Karl Ritter von Haidinger | ORDEN POUR LE MÉRITE Furthermore, the King of Bavaria bestowed the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art; the King of Sweden gave the Nordstern Orden; and the King of Portugal made Wilhelm Haidinger Commander in the Portuguese Order of Christ. Although Wilhelm Haidinger had never completed his academic training, he was promoted to &quot;doctor honoris causa&quot; in philosophy by the Charles University in Prague and to &quot;doctor honoris causa &quot;in medicine by the University of Jena (see: Von Wurzbach, 1861).

After a short illness, Wilhelm Haidinger died at his home in Vienna on 19 March 1871.

<text>Ben More (, meaning &quot;great mountain&quot;) is the highest mountain and only Munro (mountains in Scotland that reach an elevation of at least ) on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. It is also the highest peak in the Scottish isles – and the only Munro – apart from those on the Isle of Skye. The mountain is situated close to the centre of the island, above the shores of .

==Access and climbing route==
The peak is easiest reached from Loch na Keal, the walk up from the B8035 road following farm tracks, the side of a stream; , and ultimately up scree slopes to the top. From the summit on a clear day, the view encompasses the Sound of Mull, Staffa, Ulva, the Ross of Mull and Iona in the distance. From sea loch to summit is approximately a four-hour walk.

The more demanding but rewarding route follows a boggy path up the banks of to the (mountain pass) between (&quot;The Breast&quot;) and (not to be confused with its namesake in Kintail). From the the route follows South West along a steep and rocky ridge first to the peak of then on and up to Ben More itself. There is respite at the top in a circular refuge of stones. This route starts and ends on the B8035 road and is approximately a six-hour walk and scramble.

Climbers should be cautious when using a compass in misty conditions since there is magnetic rock in places, especially near the summit of the mountain.

==Geology==
Around 60 million years ago, the region was volcanically active, with Ben More being the remnant of a volcano, and it was in this period that the famous rock formations of Staffa and the basaltic columns of &quot;The Castles&quot; on Ulva came into being. The lava flows are known as the &quot;Staffa Magma Type member&quot; and can also be seen on Mull at , , and near Tobermory on its east coast. They are particularly rich in silica.

<text>Friedrich Robert Helmert (31 July 1843 – 15 June 1917) was a German geodesist and statistician with important contributions to the theory of errors.

==Career==
Helmert was born in Freiberg, Kingdom of Saxony. After schooling in Freiberg and Dresden, he entered the Polytechnische Schule, now Technische Universität, in Dresden to study engineering science in 1859. Finding him especially enthusiastic about geodesy, one of his teachers, , hired him while still a student to work on the of the Ore Mountains and the drafting of the trigonometric network for Saxony. In 1863 Helmert became Nagel&#x27;s assistant on the . After a year&#x27;s study of mathematics and astronomy Helmert obtained his doctor&#x27;s degree from the University of Leipzig in 1867 for a thesis based on his work for Nagel.

In 1870 Helmert became instructor and in 1872 professor at RWTH Aachen, the new Technical University in Aachen. At Aachen he wrote &quot;Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorieen der höheren Geodäsie&quot; (Part I was published in 1880 and Part II in 1884). This work laid the foundations of modern geodesy. See history of geodesy. Part I is devoted to the mathematical aspects of geodesy and contains a comprehensive summary of techniques for solving for geodesics on an ellipsoid.

The method of least squares had been introduced into geodesy by Gauss and Helmert wrote a fine book on least squares (1872, with a second edition in 1907) in this tradition, which became a standard text. In 1876 he discovered the chi-squared distribution as the distribution of the sample variance for a normal distribution. This discovery and other of his work was described in German textbooks, including his own, but was unknown in English, and hence later rediscovered by English statisticians – the chi-squared distribution by Karl Pearson (1900), and the application to the sample variance by &#x27;Student&#x27; and Fisher.

From 1887 Helmert was professor of advanced geodesy at the University of Berlin and director of the Geodetic Institute. In 1916 he had a stroke and died of its effects the following year in Potsdam.

==Honours==
Helmert received many honours. He was president of the global geodetic association of &quot;Internationale Erdmessung&quot;, member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1905, and recipient of some 25 German and foreign decorations.

The lunar crater Helmert was named in his honor, approved by the IAU in 1973.

<doc id="937446" wikidata="Q654749" url="?curid=937446" title="Articulated bus">
<text>An articulated bus, also referred to as a [[slinky]] bus, bendy bus, [[tandem]] bus, vestibule bus, stretch bus, or an [[accordion]] bus, is an articulated vehicle, typically a motor bus or trolleybus, used in public transportation. It is usually a single-decker, and comprises two or more rigid sections linked by a pivoting joint (articulation) enclosed by protective bellows inside and outside and a cover plate on the floor. This allows a longer legal length than rigid-bodied buses, and hence a higher passenger capacity (94–120), while still allowing the bus to maneuver adequately.

Due to their high passenger capacity, articulated buses are often used as part of bus rapid transit schemes, and can include mechanical guidance system and electric bus or trolleybus.
Articulated buses are typically long, in contrast to standard rigid buses at long. The common arrangement of an articulated bus is to have a forward section with two axles leading a rear section with a single axle, with the driving axle mounted on either the front or the rear section. Some articulated buses have a steering arrangement on the rearmost axle which turns slightly in opposition to the front steering axle, allowing the vehicle to negotiate tighter turns, similar to hook-and-ladder fire trucks operating in city environments. A less common variant of the articulated bus is the bi-articulated bus, where the vehicle has two trailer sections rather than one. Such vehicles have a capacity of around 200 people, and a length of about ; as such, they are used almost exclusively on high-capacity, high-frequency arterial routes and on bus rapid transit services.

==History==

First example of the articulated bus appeared in Milan (Italy) in 1937. In 1938, Twin Coach built an articulated bus for the city of Baltimore; this bus, which had four axles on a long body, was only articulated in the vertical direction to accommodate steep grades. 15 examples of the &quot;Super Twin&quot; were built in 1948, but it was not developed further. According to contemporary coverage, the Super Twin had a capacity of 58 seated and 120 total, with a weight of .

In Budapest, the first prototypes of the (named for its 180-passenger capacity) were shown in 1961. There is an ongoing exhibition in Budapest at the Hungarian Technical and Transportation Museum in 2010 with the title &quot;The articulated bus is 50 years old.&quot; The Ikarus 180 went into limited production in 1963, and entered serial production in 1966; the Ikarus 180 was discontinued in 1973 when its successor, the Ikarus 280 was released.


In the mid-1960s, AC Transit in California pioneered the American use of a modern articulated bus, operating the experimental commuter coach &quot;XMC 77&quot; (based on Continental Trailways&#x27; Bus &amp; Car Co. Super Golden Eagle model) on some of its transbay lines. The XMC-77, which AC Transit dubbed the &quot;Freeway Train&quot;, was originally built in 1958, purchased by the District in October 1965, and made its debut run for Line N on 14 March 1966; passengers on the inaugural run were presented with special souvenir tickets. XMC-77 was later exhibited to the public at various locations in the East Bay and the Transbay Terminal. It offered seats for 77 passengers (finished in brown and orange) and an observation lounge, complete with a card table to seat a quartet. The long coach stood high and was powered by a Cummins engine with an output of . Engineering for the XMC-77 was carried out by the local firm of DeLeuw Cather &amp; Co.

In the United States, articulated buses were imported from Europe and deployed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this time, rising operating costs led to public takeovers of transit systems, and the pressure to reduce labor (driver) costs in turn meant transporting more passengers in a single vehicle. King County Metro and Caltrans led a Pooled Purchase Consortium, formed in 1976, which later awarded a contract to the AM General/MAN joint venture responsible for assembling MAN SG 220 (from Germany) articulated buses in America. Contemporaneously, Crown entered an agreement with Ikarus to produce the Crown-Ikarus 286, coupling American-made powertrains with the Hungarian Ikarus 280 chassis.

Articulated buses have also been used in Australia, Austria (Gräf &amp; Stift), Italy, Germany (Gaubschat, Emmelmann, Göppel, Duewag, Vetter), Canada (LFS Articulated), Hungary (Ikarus), Poland (Jelcz AP02), Romania (DAC 117 UD). The first modern British &quot;bendy buses&quot; (as they are referred to in the UK and Canada) were built by Leyland-DAB and used in the city of Sheffield in the 1980s. They were subsequently withdrawn from service because they proved to be expensive to maintain.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Advantages===
The main benefits of an articulated bus over the double-decker bus are rapid simultaneous boarding and disembarkation through more and larger doors, increased stability arising from a lower centre of gravity, smaller frontal area giving less air resistance than double decker buses thus better fuel efficiency, often a smaller turning radius, higher maximum service speed, the ability to pass under low bridges, and improved accessibility for people with disabilities and the elderly.

===Disadvantages===

In some circumstances of urban operation (such as in areas with narrow streets and tight turns), articulated buses may also be involved in significantly more accidents than conventional buses. Estimates for London&#x27;s articulated buses put their involvement in accidents involving pedestrians at over five times the rate of all other buses, and over twice as high for accidents involving cyclists. In a period when articulated buses made up approximately 5% of the London bus fleet, they were involved in 20% of all bus-related deaths, statistics which eventually led to their replacement. However, these safety statistics may be partly skewed due to the buses having been used on the busiest routes in the most crowded areas of the city, making them look worse than the buses they were being compared with. Other commentators have described these types of buses as &#x27;flaccid and unappealing&#x27;, preferring the sturdiness of their rigid-body counterparts. The last disadvantage of an articulated bus is that it requires a specially trained driver in some cases.

Articulated buses also struggle in snowy or icy conditions; because the rear axle delivers power, this causes the bus to “jackknife” or bend in the middle when attempting to go up a hill or through a snowdrift.

==Use==
An articulated bus is a long vehicle and usually requires a specially trained driver, as maneuvering (particularly reversing) can be difficult. The trailer section of a &quot;puller&quot; bus can be subject to unusual centripetal forces, which many people can find uncomfortable, although this is not an issue with &quot;pushers&quot;. Nonetheless, the articulated bus is highly successful in Budapest, Hungary, where the BKV city transit company has been operating more than 1000 of them every day since the early 1970s. The Hungarian company Volán also runs hundreds of articulated buses on intercity lines.

===Europe===

Articulated buses have been used in most European countries for many years. Articulated buses became popular in mainland Europe due to their increased capacity compared with regular buses. In many cities, lower railway bridge clearances have precluded the use of double-deck vehicles, which have never achieved great popularity there. Overhead wires for trams, trolleybuses, etc. are not really relevant issues, as the minimum normal clearance above road level is standard across the EU and is well in excess of the height of a double-deck vehicle—otherwise, many freight vehicles would encounter severe problems in the course of normal operation.

====Malta====
From 3 July 2011 to 28 August 2013, articulated Mercedes Citaro buses purchased from London were used in Malta by the company Arriva on a number of routes across the country. A number of serious engine fires resulted in their withdrawal from service, and they have also been responsible for causing an increase in traffic congestion and accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists.

====United Kingdom====

Until 1980, articulated buses were illegal on the UK&#x27;s roads. A 1979 experiment by South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive with buses manufactured by MAN and Leyland-DAB led to a change in the law, but the experiment was abandoned in 1981 because double-decker buses were generally considered less expensive both to purchase and to operate. The cost and weight of the strengthened deck framing and staircase of a double-decker was lower than the cost and weight of the additional axle(s) and coupling mechanism of an articulated bus. Modern technology has reduced the weight disadvantage, and the benefits of a continuous low floor allowing easier access plus additional entrance doors for smoother loading have led to reconsideration of the use of articulated buses in the UK.
In London, articulated buses were used on some routes from 2001 until 2011, but they were not a success. Boris Johnson, former Mayor of London, promised in the run-up to the mayoral election of 2008 to rid the city of the controversial buses and replaced them with double deckers.

Elsewhere in the UK, they are generally operated on particular routes in order to increase passenger numbers, rather than across entire networks. With unsupervised &quot;open boarding&quot; through three doors and the requirement for pre-purchase of tickets, levels of fare-dodging on the new vehicles were found to be at least three times higher than on conventional buses where entry of passengers is monitored by the driver or conductor. The only way of checking for free riders was to use large teams of ticket inspectors to swamp the bus and inspect all tickets while keeping the doors closed, meanwhile delaying the further progress of the bus. Since the articulated buses were tending to serve areas of relative deprivation it is suspected that this was a contributory factor in Transport for London (TfL) turning against the concept.

Many of the articulated buses from London went on to serve with regional operators. Aside from limited use in regional cities, articulated buses may now be found at airports as park and ride shuttles.
A batch of 9 Mercedes Benz Citaros currently run on First Aberdeen routes 1 and 2, and 5 others run with First York on York Park and ride services 2 and 3 but are being phased out by more modern Wright Streetdecks and Optare Metrodeckets

In 2020, twenty one brand new Mercedes Benz Citaros entered service at Stansted Airport; the Mercedes Benz Citaro is the only articulated bus available in the United Kingdom at present.

The last public Wright Eclipse Fusion bendy buses ran on 26 March 2023 on service 888 between Luton airport and Luton airport parkway station, the service being replaced by the Luton DART monorail service.

===Asia===

====China====

In Asia, many major Chinese cities had fleets of articulated buses prior to the late 1990s. Some of these fleets have since been replaced by single-section units except in a few cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. In the 2000s, a surge in BRT construction has reintroduced or re-purposed the articulated bus fleets for rapid transit usage in cities like Changzhou, Chengdu, Dalian, Guangzhou, Jinan, Kunming, Xiamen, Yancheng, Zaozhuang, and Zhengzhou.

==== Indonesia ====

Indonesia first operated articulated buses in 1993, when Jakarta&#x27;s bus company PPD began to operate Ikarus articulated busses from Hungary on several busy lines. Later, the company also imported Chinese-made articulated buses. PPD dominated Jakarta city bus service until 2004, when Transjakarta was established; it operates one of the longest BRT systems in the world. Transjakarta has been using articulated buses manufactured by Scania for some of their busiest routes since 2015. Prior to Scania buses&#x27; introduction, there were Chinese-made Huanghai, Zhong Tong, Yutong, Ankai, and local-made INKA Inobus and AAI Komodo buses in service since 2010.

====Israel====

In Israel, the use of articulated buses—commonly called &quot;accordion bus, אוטובוס אקורדיון&quot;—is widespread, particularly in Gush Dan and Jerusalem, the two great urban centers of the country, as well as in Haifa (for the Metronit BRT system) and other cities such as Beersheba. The long buses are considered reliable and useful, and have been in service in Israel since the mid-1970s. During the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, such buses were often targeted by Palestinians and suicide bombers during rush hours, since a crowded long bus can contain more than 100 passengers.

====Macau====
In Macau, China, Transmac (Transportes Urbanos de Macau S.A.R.L.) imported a Yutong ZK6180HGH 18-meter articulated bus model, and put it into operation on 6 January 2018 following multiple tests and adjustments. The bus operated on route 51 and 25BS during peak hours. It also served route 25AX before typhoon wipha/on golden weeks in 2019 and also route 26S after the annual international firework shows. In 2023, Transmac imported two 18-meter Higer KLQ6186GHEV extended range electric articulated bus model that runs on the same route 51, 25BS and 26S as it&#x27;s predecessor, first put into operation on 21 January 2024 as a after-show shuttle in Macau. The old ZK6180HGH is now used for non-franchised services, such as event shuttles or casino employers shuttles, as the government tends to fade out all diesel buses from franchised services.

==== Singapore ====

In Singapore, articulated buses were first introduced in 1996 by Trans-Island Bus Services (now SMRT Buses) with the Mercedes-Benz O405G buses (bodied in Hispano Carrocera (MK1/MK2), Hispano Habit and Volgren CR221). In 2015, SMRT introduced 40 MAN NG363F A24 buses to replace the first batch of O405Gs, while the subsequent batches were replaced by double deck buses issued by the Land Transport Authority. All Hispano Habit-bodied O405Gs have been retired from service as of December 2020 as part of Land Transport Authority&#x27;s policy of a 100% wheelchair-accessible bus fleet.

Singapore Bus Services (SBS, present-day SBS Transit) introduced one Duple Metsec-bodied Volvo B10M articulated and one Volgren-bodied Mercedes Benz O405G in-between 1996 and 1997 respectively to evaluate the suitability of articulated buses for high-capacity single deck bus operations. The trial was however unsuccessful and SBS stuck to the use of 12 metre double deck &quot;Superbuses&quot;. The two articulated buses were eventually sold off to Bayes Coachlines of Dairy Flat, Auckland in New Zealand in March 2006. SBS Transit only began to operate articulated buses again from March 2018 when ten former SMRT MAN NG363F A24 buses were transferred to SBS Transit in batches by the Land Transport Authority as part of the Seletar Bus Package under the Bus Contracting Model.

In March 2021, Tower Transit Singapore took over MAN NG363F A24 bus from SMRT Buses in preparation for the takeover of Sembawang-Yishun Bus Package. Tower Transit took over more units as part of the transition in September 2021.

====Taiwan====
Articulated buses were first used in Taiwan in 2014 as the Taichung BRT. The BRT system was abolished a year later, and the articulated buses run as regular buses along the same route.

====Vietnam====
In Vietnam, articulated bus service was first introduced and operated on 16 October 2010, by Transerco in Hanoi. It was added to the route 07 from My Dinh Bus Station to Noi Bai Airport as a test run. The bus was part of the Hanoi Ecotrans project subsidized by the EU and Ile de France. It was a Mercedes Euro II Galaxy which was first manufactured in December 2003 by Mercedes-Benz Vietnam and was previously used for SEA Games in Hanoi. The bus was painted yellow instead of traditional white-yellow-red (from top to bottom) and had two ticket sellers onboard instead of one. The bus received positive reviews from passengers but the bus no longer operates in Hanoi; route 07 is now served by Daewoo BC095 buses.

===North America===

====United States====
Articulated buses are commonplace in US urban centers such as Albuquerque, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Honolulu, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, Miami, Minneapolis-St.Paul, New York City, Newark, Orange County (California), Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland (Oregon), Rochester (New York), San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and Westchester County (New York). In Eugene, Lane Transit District uses articulated buses on some high-traffic routes, as well as on their Emerald Express (EmX) Bus Rapid Transit Service. In Vancouver, Washington, C-Tran (Washington) uses articulated buses on their BRT service, The Vine (bus rapid transit).

====Canada====

In Canada, they are used in Brampton, Calgary, Durham Region, Edmonton, Gatineau, Halifax, Hamilton, London, Longueuil, Mississauga, Montreal, Niagara Region, Ottawa, Quebec City, Regina, Saskatoon, St. Albert, Toronto, York Region, Metro Vancouver and Winnipeg.

====Mexico====
Articulated buses in Mexico are usually used on BRT lines, such as Mexico City&#x27;s Metrobús, Guadalajara&#x27;s Macrobús, Monterrey&#x27;s Ecovía and León&#x27;s Optibús.

===South America===
In South America, they are used in Quito, São Paulo, Santiago, Curitiba, Barranquilla, Cali, Bucaramanga, Pereira, Cartagena, Medellín and Bogotá.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

The first articulated bus in Australia operated in Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory in 1974. They remain in service for Transport Canberra serving both rapid and feeder routes.

In Adelaide, articulated buses are used on the O-Bahn Busway, reaching speeds of 100 km/h. The first articulated buses to use it were the Mercedes-Benz O305G buses; however, three MAN SG280H buses are also equipped for O-Bahn use. In recent years, it has proven problematic to find suitable low-floor articulated buses to replace the 1984-manufactured Mercedes buses, because the design of the O-Bahn track unfortunately precludes the use of most modern articulated buses. Sydney has seen the operation of articulated buses for many years. Currently it operates a fleet of various models with eighty Volvo B12BLEA buses joining the Sydney Buses fleet in 2005 and 2006, increasing capacity along many of the busy corridors. A number of prototype vehicles were delivered in 2008 &amp; 2009 to operate on Sydney Buses&#x27; first Metrobus route, the M10 from Leichhardt to Kingsford and Maroubra Junction. The buses feature different chassis, body types, and internal layouts. The articulated Volvo B12BLEA buses are fully wheelchair-accessible, air-conditioned, and have visual and audible next-stop passenger information systems installed. The buses feature air-conditioning, large electronic destination displays and cloth seating. Additionally, each bus features a stepless entry, which will assist less-mobile passengers. Flip-up seats in the front part of the bus allow easy accommodation for passengers in wheelchairs and with strollers and prams. In 2009-2010 150 new Volvo B12BLEA articulated buses have been introduced into the Sydney Buses fleet, many of these part of the expanded Metrobus program.

==Design==
===Doors===
Articulated buses typically feature at least two and sometimes three curbside doors for passengers. Because the articulation joint is close behind the middle axle, usually four potential passenger door positions are possible on a single-articulated bus:
# Between the windshield and front axle (A)
# Between the front axle and middle axle (B)
# Between the articulation joint and rear axle (X)
# Between the rear axle and rear bulkhead (Y)

===Powertrain===

Articulated buses can be of &quot;pusher&quot; or &quot;puller&quot; configuration. Very few companies specialise in manufacturing the articulated section for the buses. One that does is &quot;ATG Autotechnik GmbH&quot; in Siek near Hamburg.

====Puller====

In most puller articulated buses, the engine is mounted under the floor between the front and middle axles, and only the middle axle is powered. Some consider this an outdated design, as it prohibits floor levels lower than approximately , and can produce passenger discomfort due to high noise and vibration levels. On the other hand, they can be used in very narrow or severely potholed streets. This type of bus also performs better in snowy or icy conditions, as the thrust from the driving wheels does not cause the vehicle to jackknife. Newer models such as the Van Hool AG300 feature low floors while maintaining the puller design by placing the engine block off-center opposite to the second door. Also, the unpowered rear axle is much simpler and carries no engine weight, facilitating the installation of counter-steering mechanisms to further decrease the turning radius.

A typical puller model is the Hungarian-made Ikarus 280, the articulated version of the Ikarus 260, of which 60,993 buses were manufactured between 1973 and 2002, mostly for Soviet bloc customers. (This type accounted for two-thirds of the articulated buses built in the 1970s.) Puller-type articulated buses are built in less numbers, but are still available in Scandinavia and South America. Examples being the Volvo B9S and Volvo B12M.

====Pusher====
The pusher bus needs a damping system in the joint to reduce the risk of jack-knifing and fishtailing. This was developed by the FFG Fahrzeugwerkstätten Falkenried in Germany. The production cost of the pusher bus was lower than that of a puller bus. The puller bus was a completely different construction compared to a solo bus which was often fabricated by external body construction firms due to the lower production numbers compared to solo buses. The pusher concept enabled the bus manufacturer to simply join a forward and a rear part of a solo bus and build the articulated bus completely in-house. This reduced the production cost.

In pusher buses, only the rear axle is powered by a rear-mounted internal combustion engine, and the longitudinal stability of the vehicle is maintained by active hydraulics mounted under the turntable. This modern system makes it possible to build buses without steps and having low floors along their entire length, which simplifies access for passengers with limited mobility.

Modern low-floor pusher articulated buses also tend to suffer from suspension problems because their wheels lack sufficient travel to enable them to absorb typical road surface unevenness. This also leads to passenger discomfort and relatively rapid disintegration of the vehicle&#x27;s superstructure.

Makers of pusher-type articulated buses include Mercedes-Benz, New Flyer Industries, MAN, Volvo and Scania. The Renault PR 180 and PR 180.2 (articulated versions of the PR 100 and PR 100.2) were a special variation of the pusher design in which both the middle and the rear axles were driven, with a driveshaft passing through the turntable between the two driving axles.

====Alternative power====

Although the majority of articulated buses utilise diesel engines for their motive power, a number of operators (primarily outside North America and by LACMTA) have adopted compressed natural gas (CNG) power in order to reduce pollution. Many other transit authorities in the United States and Canada are adopting articulated buses that are diesel-electric hybrids, such as the New Flyer DE60LF. There are also articulated trolleybuses, which use catenary cables to power electric traction motors. Electric articulated trolleybuses principally operate in hilly locations like Mexico City, San Francisco, Seattle, and Vancouver, B.C., where the steep grades preclude the use of combustion engines for motive power.

The New Flyer Xcelsior Charge NG battery-electric articulated buses are equipped with traction motors on both the middle and rear axles; the middle axle uses in-wheel motors.

===Articulation===
====Super-articulated buses====
Super articulated bus are similar to the normal articulated buses, but they have a fourth tag axle next to the rear axle, increasing the rated load. Typical capacity ranges up to 200 passengers and the length increases from . Examples include the Mercedes-Benz Citaro CapaCity, MAN Lion&#x27;s City GXL (A43), Mercedes-Benz O500 DA, BYD D11, and Scania K IA.

====Bi-articulated buses====
Since the late 1980s, the concept of the articulated bus has been extended further with the addition of a second trailer section that extends the bus almost to tram length and capacity, to create a bi-articulated bus, also called a triple bus. The Chinese manufacturer Zhejiang Youngman (Jinhua Neoplan) has developed the JNP6280G bi-articulated bus, deemed the &quot;world&#x27;s largest&quot;, which will be used in Beijing.

Bi-articulated buses are still rare, having been trialled and rejected in some places. Because of their length they have a role on very high-capacity routes, or as a component of a bus rapid transit scheme. Major examples of bi-articulated buses playing a major role in bus rapid transit can be found in Curitiba, Bogota, Mexico City, Quito, etc. Volvo is a major supplier of puller-type bi-articulated buses in these markets. In the Netherlands, bi-articulated buses came into service in Utrecht (2002) and Groningen (2014) on busy routes.

===Decks===
Most articulated buses use a single passenger level or deck.

====Double-decker articulated buses====
A few attempts have been made to design a double-decker articulated bus. NEOPLAN Bus GmbH built a handful of Neoplan Jumbocruisers between 1975 and 1992. In these models, only the upper deck allows movement between the two sections, so each section has its own doors and set of stairs.

==Driver licensing==
In some countries of the European Union, as well as in Canada, an articulated bus can be driven with the same license used to drive a rigid bus (D in Europe), while a bus towing a normal trailer requires a bus + trailer (D+E) license.

There is some confusion as to how the U.S. treats articulated buses, but the general agreement in professional circles a large misconception seems to be that they&#x27;re treated as combination vehicles, and therefore requires that drivers hold a Class A commercial driver license (CDL) with a passenger (P) endorsement, which requires the passage of both a written and driven exam. However, based on guidelines from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), an articulated motorcoach (bus) driver is required to possess a Class B CDL. The driven exam can be completed in the Class B bus the driver wishes to operate. It is common for restrictions to be issued on the driver&#x27;s license disallowing them to operate higher classes of vehicles than they tested on. A common restriction is a driver with a Class B CDL that performs their P endorsement test on a class B bus, resulting in their license bearing the &quot;no class A passenger vehicle&quot; restriction, which is notated with an &#x27;M&#x27;, in addition to their P endorsement. These restrictions can be removed through further testing at a later date.

In the UK it is only necessary to hold a D licence on articulated buses where the driven axle is in the rear section.
As the front cannot be driven without the rear, for licensing purposes they are not considered to have a trailer necessitating the E entitlement. However, special training is needed for bi-articulated buses.

==In popular culture==
In a campaign associated with the &quot;&quot; film, a 2014 Transformers character was created using parts from an articulated bus with the actual vehicle as its intended alternate form and dubbed &quot;Bendy-Bus Prime.&quot;

<doc id="937447" wikidata="Q3648629" url="?curid=937447" title="CDC STAR-100">
<text>The CDC STAR-100 is a vector supercomputer that was designed, manufactured, and marketed by Control Data Corporation (CDC). It was one of the first machines to use a vector processor to improve performance on appropriate scientific applications. It was also the first supercomputer to use integrated circuits and the first to be equipped with one million words of computer memory.

STAR is a blend of STrings&quot; (of binary digits) and ARrays.&quot; The 100 alludes to the nominal peak processing speed of 100 million floating point operations per second (MFLOPS); the earlier CDC 7600 provided peak performance of 36 MFLOPS but more typically ran at around 10 MFLOPS.

The design was part of a bid made to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the mid-1960s. Livermore was looking for a partner who would build a much faster machine on their own budget and then lease the resulting design to the lab. It was announced publicly in the early 1970s, and on 17 August 1971, CDC announced that General Motors had placed the first commercial order for it.

A number of basic design features of the machine meant that its real-world performance was much lower than expected when first used commercially in 1974, and was one of the primary reasons CDC was pushed from its former dominance in the supercomputer market when the Cray-1 was announced in 1975. Only three STAR-100 systems were delivered, two to LLNL and another to NASA Langley Research Center.

==Description==
The STAR had a 64-bit architecture, consisting of 195 instructions. Its main innovation was the inclusion of 65 vector instructions for vector processing. The operations performed by these instructions were strongly influenced by concepts and operators from the APL programming language; in particular, the concept of &quot;control vectors&quot; (vector masks in modern terminology), and several instructions for vector permutation with control vectors, were carried over directly from APL.

The vector instructions operated on vectors that were stored in consecutive locations in main memory; memory addressing was virtual. The vector instructions fed an arithmetic pipeline; a single instruction could add two variable-length vectors of up to 65,535 elements with just one instruction fetch. The STAR also fetched vector operands in 512-bit units (superwords), reducing average memory latency.

Since the memory location of the &quot;next&quot; operand is known, the CPU can fetch the next operands while it is operating on the previous ones. As with instruction pipelines in general, the time needed to complete any one instruction was no better than it was before, but since the CPU is working on a number of data points at once, the overall performance dramatically improves.

Many of the STAR&#x27;s instructions were complex, especially the &quot;vector macro&quot; instructions, which performed complex operations that normally would have required long sequences of instructions. These instructions, along with the STAR&#x27;s generally complex architecture, was implemented with microcode.

Main memory had a capacity of 65,536 512-bit words, called superwords (SWORDs). Main memory was 32-way interleaved to pipeline memory accesses. It was constructed from core memory with an access time of 1.28 μs. The main memory was accessed via a 512-bit bus, controlled by the &quot;storage access controller&quot; (SAC), which handled requests from the &quot;stream unit&quot;. The stream unit accesses the main memory through the SAC via three 128-bit data buses, two for reads, and one for writes. There is also a 128-bit data bus for instruction fetch, I/O, and control vector access. The stream unit serves as the control unit, fetching and decoding instructions, initiating memory accesses on the behalf of the pipelined functional units, and controlling instruction execution, among other tasks. It also contains two read buffers and one write buffer for streaming data to the execution units.

The STAR-100 has two arithmetic pipelines. The first has a floating point adder and multiplier, and the second can execute all scalar instructions. It also contains a floating point adder, multiplier, and divider. Both pipelines are 64-bit for floating point operations and are controlled by microcode. The STAR-100 can split its floating point pipelines into four 32-bit pipelines, doubling the peak performance of the system to 100 MFLOPS at the expense of half the precision.

The STAR-100 uses I/O processors to offload I/O from the CPU. Each I/O processor is a 16-bit minicomputer with its own main memory of 65,536 words of 16 bits each, which is implemented with core memory. The I/O processors all share a 128-bit data bus to the SAC.

==Real-world performance, users and impact==
The STAR-100&#x27;s real-world performance was a fraction of its theoretical performance for a number of reasons. Firstly, the vector instructions, being &quot;memory-to-memory,&quot; had a relatively long startup time, since the pipeline from the memory to the functional units was very long. In contrast to the register-based pipelined functional units in the 7600, the STAR pipelines were much deeper. The problem was compounded by the fact that the STAR had a slower cycle time than the 7600 (40 ns vs 27.5 ns). So the vector length needed for the STAR to run faster than the 7600 occurred at about 50 elements; if the loops were working on data sets with fewer elements, the time cost of setting up the vector pipeline was higher than the time savings provided by the vector instruction(s).

When the machine was released in 1974, it quickly became apparent that the general performance was disappointing. Very few programs can be effectively vectorized into a series of single instructions; nearly all calculations will rely on the results of some earlier instruction, yet the results had to clear the pipelines before they could be fed back in. This forced most programs to pay the high setup cost of the vector units, and generally the ones that did &quot;work&quot; were extreme examples. Worse, basic scalar performance was sacrificed to improve vector performance. Any time that the program had to run scalar instructions, the overall performance of the machine dropped dramatically. (See Amdahl&#x27;s Law.)

Two STAR-100 systems were eventually delivered to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and one to NASA Langley Research Center. In preparation for the STAR deliveries, LLNL programmers developed a library of subroutines, called &quot;STACKLIB&quot;, on the 7600 to emulate the vector operations of the STAR. In the process of developing STACKLIB, they found that programs converted to use it ran faster than they had before, even on the 7600. This placed further pressures on the performance of the STAR.

The STAR-100 was a disappointment to everyone involved. Jim Thornton, formerly Seymour Cray&#x27;s close assistant on the CDC 1604 and 6600 projects and the chief designer of STAR, left CDC to form Network Systems Corporation. An updated version of the basic architecture was later released in 1979 as the Cyber 203, followed by the Cyber 205 in 1980, but by this point systems from Cray Research with considerably higher performance were on the market. The failure of the STAR led to CDC being pushed from its former dominance in the supercomputer market, something they tried to address with the formation of ETA Systems in September 1983.

<doc id="937450" wikidata="Q969823" url="?curid=937450" title="Pierre Dupont de l'Étang">
<text>Pierre-Antoine, comte Dupont de l&#x27;Étang (4 July 1765 – 9 March 1840) was a French Army officer, nobleman and politician who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

==Life==
===Revolutionary Wars===
Born in Chabanais, Charente, Dupont first saw active service during the French Revolutionary Wars as a member of the in the Netherlands, and in 1791 was on the staff of the Army of the North under General Théobald Dillon.

He distinguished himself in the Battle of Valmy, and in the fighting around Menen in the campaign of 1793 he forced an Austrian regiment to surrender. Promoted to brigadier general for this accomplishment, he soon received further advancement from Lazare Carnot, who recognized his abilities. In 1797, he became &quot;général de division&quot;.

The rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, whom he supported in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (November 1799), brought him further opportunities under the Consulate and Empire. In the campaign of 1800 he was chief of staff to Louis-Alexandre Berthier, the nominal commander of the Army of Peierve of the Ains which won the Battle of Marengo. After the battle he sustained a successful combat, against greatly superior forces, at Pozzolo.

===Napoleonic Wars===
In the campaign on the Danube in 1805, as the leader of one of Michel Ney&#x27;s divisions, Dupont earned further distinction, especially in the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen (Albeck), in which he prevented the escape of the Austrians from Ulm, and so contributed most effectively to the isolation and subsequent capture of Karl Mack von Leiberich and his whole army. He also distinguished himself in the Battle of Friedland.

With a record such as but few of Napoleon&#x27;s divisional commanders possessed, he entered Spain in 1808 at the head of a motley corps made up of provisional battalions and Swiss troops impressed into French service from the Spanish Royal Army (&quot;see Peninsular War&quot;). After the occupation of Madrid, Dupont, newly created count by Napoleon, was sent with his force to subdue Andalusia. After a few initial successes he had to retire toward the passes of the Sierra Morena. Pursued and cut off by a Spanish army under the Captain General Castaños, his corps was defeated in the Battle of Bailén after his Swiss troops deserted and returned to their former allegiance. Painfully wounded in the hip, Dupont felt constrained to capitulate. Even so, Dupont sent secret orders to General Dominique Vedel to escape with his division, which was outside the Spanish trap. When the Spanish found out, they threatened to massacre Dupont&#x27;s men if Vedel did not also surrender, which Vedel did. Altogether 17,600 French soldiers laid down their arms in the disaster. Madrid fell to the resurgent Spanish forces and this soon compelled Napoleon to intervene with his Grand Army in order to salvage the situation.

===Disgrace and Bourbon Restoration===
Dupont fell into the emperor&#x27;s disgrace, as it was not taken into account that his troops were for the most part raw levies and that ill-luck contributed materially to the catastrophe. After his return to France, Dupont was sent before a court-martial, deprived of his rank and title, and imprisoned at Fort de Joux from 1812 to 1814.

Released only by the initial Restoration, he was employed by Louis XVIII in a military command, which he lost on the return of Napoleon during the Hundred Days. But the Second Restoration saw him reinstated to the army and appointed a member of the &quot;conseil privé&quot; of Louis XVIII. Between April and December 1814, he was Minister of War, but his reactionary politics made the monarch recall him. From 1815 to 1830, Dupont was deputy for the Charente.

==Death==
He lived in retirement from 1832, working on his memoirs until his death in 1840. He lies buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Duellist==
An episode in the life of Pierre Dupont de l&#x27;Étang inspired the novel &quot;The Duel&quot; by Joseph Conrad (1908), which was turned into the film &quot;The Duellists&quot;, by Ridley Scott.

As a young officer in Napoleon&#x27;s Army, Dupont was ordered to deliver a disagreeable message to a fellow officer, Fournier, a rabid duellist. Fournier, taking out his subsequent rage on the messenger, challenged Dupont to a duel. This sparked a succession of encounters, waged with sword and pistol, that spanned decades. The contest was eventually resolved when Dupont was able to overcome Fournier in a pistol duel, forcing him to promise never to bother him again.

Dupont was the model for Armand d&#x27;Hubert, played by Keith Carradine in the film. Over a period of roughly 20 years, Dupont de l&#x27;Étang fought a series of more than 20 duels with his fellow officer, the particularly quarrelsome Fournier, nicknamed by the Spaniards &quot;el demonio&quot; (Gabriel Féraud, in the film, and played by Harvey Keitel).

==Personal life==
Pierre Dupont was married on 26 December 1804 to Jeanne Grâce Bergon, daughter of a state counsellor, who died in the château des Ternes (Paris) on 13 June 1858. They had two children:
* Jean Pierre Théophile, comte Dupont; born in Paris 23 February 1806, died 6 May 1843, married 22 July 1837 to Adele Lidorie Bickham (born in Mauritius 17 October 1808, died Paris 18 November 1841), parents of Arthur, comte Dupont born in Paris 10 May 1839.
* Claire Joséphine Grace Dupont; married to Eugène Panon Desbassayns de Richemont, comte de Richemont.

He also had an illegitimate son, Aimé Dupont (born 1790 in Maastricht), who became a colonel of engineers.

His niece Claire Grâce Dupont de Savignat was the mother of Marie François Sadi Carnot, President of the Republic.

<text>The City of Logan is a local government area (LGA) located in the south of Greater Brisbane in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. Situated between the City of Brisbane to the north and the City of Gold Coast to the south, the City of Logan also borders the Scenic Rim Region, the City of Ipswich, and Redland City LGAs. Logan is divided into 70 suburbs and 12 divisions; a councillor is elected to each of the latter. The council had a population of 326,615 as of June 2018.

Gaining significant area in 2008 from the amalgamation of parts of the Albert and Beaudesert Shires, the City of Logan extends north to Priestdale, south to Mundoolun near the Albert River, east to Carbrook at the Logan River, and west to Lyons. Logan is located across parts of the sub-basin of Oxley Creek, and the Logan and Albert Rivers. The Daisy Hill Koala Centre serves as an example of Logan&#x27;s prominent bushland, reminiscent of Karawatha Forest, and the Tamborine and Venman Bushland National Parks, that border Logan suburbs.

The region is named after Captain Patrick Logan, as is the aforementioned river, alongside the commercial hubs of Logan Central, Shailer Park&#x27;s Logan Hyperdome, and Browns Plains. Other populous suburbs include Beenleigh, Rochedale South, Meadowbrook, Springwood, Woodridge, Eagleby and the rural towns of Jimboomba and Logan Village. The city facilitates much of the transport between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Its motorway network is extensive: in the city&#x27;s north-east, the Logan Motorway joins the Pacific Motorway, while the Mount Lindesay Highway and Sydney–Brisbane rail corridor cross the city along a roughly central north-south axis. New developments are common, particularly those being built at Yarrabilba and Greater Flagstone, while Griffith University has already established a Logan campus in Meadowbrook which is being developed into a specialist area based around health, research and education.

In 2016, Luke Smith was elected mayor of Logan. On 2 May 2019, Minister for Local Government Stirling Hinchliffe sacked the Logan City Council after eight of its Councillors and suspended mayor were charged with one count of fraud. The suspended Mayor was also charged with two counts of misconduct. The council was under administration until March 2020 elections.

In the , the City of Logan had a population of 345,098 people.

== History ==

Yugembah (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is an Australian Aboriginal languages of South East Queensland. The Yugembah language areas include Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Tweed River Valley, Albert River, Beaudesert, Beenleigh, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama and Tamborine, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley.

The Commandant of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, Captain Patrick Logan, was a compulsive explorer and in 1826 on his first expedition he discovered the Logan River. He noted the river was well suited to large-vessel traffic and was a first-class avenue to access the high-quality arable land along its banks. He named the country Darling, in honour of the Governor. The Governor renamed the river after Logan. One of the first large employers was the timber industry. The Logan River served as a rafting ground for logs and the new railways spurred local demand.

The penal settlement based in Brisbane was closed in 1841 and the land was quickly taken up by squatters. The first leases of land in the Logan area were issued from 1849 and immigration was encouraged following the separation from NSW in 1859. The declaration of the Logan and Eight Mile Plains Agricultural Reserves in 1862 led to extensive settlement of the area. German immigrants arrived in batches from the 1864 onwards. Generous land orders for immigrants in Queensland created a drawcard in the possibility of owning their own farm.

A cotton gin, which was converted to a sugar mill, was built at Loganholme in 1867. Cotton growers faced problems with both the weather and a lack of available labour despite the introduction of Kanaka labour. By the 1870s few working cotton plantations remained along the Logan River. While this crop was marginally successful, between 1866 and 1874, sugar was soon to become the staple industry.
Many small sugar mills were started by farmers seeking to avoid processing costs charged by big mills. However these quickly proved to be uneconomic. Many farmers in the area abandoned sugar after a severe frost in 1885 and a catastrophic flood in 1887 which saw crops destroyed and covered with metres of silt. Others continued growing sugar cane to make 1890 one of the best harvests ever. In 1888, the railway opened in Logan. Within a year, Cobb and Co services ended in Logan.

Significant flooding occurred in Logan during the 1974 Brisbane flood. The Wild Water Water Slide Park began operations in October 1982. The site was to become the Logan Hyperdome with the first work on the regional shopping centre beginning in October 1988. It was officially opened in July 1989. Construction work on the Logan Hospital started in February 1989. In August 2011, the Logan suburb of Slacks Creek was the location for Queensland&#x27;s worst house fire.

In 2017, a water treatment plant at Round Mountain became the first in Australia to be powered entirely off-grid.

=== Establishment of Logan ===

The Department of Local Government instigated the formation of the new Logan Shire, which included the northern suburbs of both Albert and Beaudesert Shires. A section in the north previously belonged to the Shire of Tingalpa. There were about 69,000 people living to the north of the Logan River. On 31 May 1978 Local Government Minister Russ Hinze introduced the Local Government (Adjustment of Boundaries) Bill and which was officially approved on 8 June 1978. Logan then was declared a city on 1 January 1981 and the administration building on Wembley Road was opened in February 1981.

The city was named after Captain Patrick Logan, one of the founders of the Moreton Bay convict settlement. Logan was honoured in the names of many locales in the district, such as the Logan River, the suburbs of Loganlea, Logan Village, Loganholme, Logan Reserve and Logan Central, the Logan Motorway and Logan Road, which connects Logan City with the nearby state capital of Brisbane.

=== Local government changes ===
With the major changes to local government in Queensland which took effect at 15 March 2008 local elections, Logan more than tripled in area and added 78,400 people to its population. This came about through annexing a large section of the now-dissolved Shire of Beaudesert as well as the Beenleigh-Eagleby suburban area to its southeast, which had been part of the Gold Coast. Residents of Beenleigh and Eagleby were asked to vote to join Logan, with an overwhelming &quot;No&quot; vote. Despite this, the amalgamation went ahead. In its rationale for the changes, the Local Government Reform Commission argued that the area added brought the South East Queensland urban footprint and future growth areas to 2026 under the one local government, which could plan effectively for the area&#x27;s future and would face reduced compliance costs for development works. Economic factors, the lack of geographic barriers and the presence of transport corridors were also considered to be favourable to the annexation. Consideration was given to a merger with Redland to its east, but geographical barriers and the lack of a community of interest between them militated against this.

== Demographics ==
The area is a major regional growth and development corridor with significant population growth expected through to 2041, second only to Brisbane in the state. The city has a higher rate of multicultural diversity than the Queensland average. About one quarter of Logan&#x27;s residents were born overseas.

First proclaimed in 1984, Rankin has elected a member of the Labor Party at every election since inception. The newer parts of Logan are within Forde, while Moreton and Oxley contain small portions of Logan City closer to Brisbane. The Division of Wright, created in 2010, contains many of the rural areas in the southern part of the city.

<text>Jakub Zadzik (1582 – 17 March 1642) was a Polish Great Crown Secretary from 1613 to 1627, bishop of Chełmno from 1624, Crown Deputy Chancellor from 1627, Great Crown Chancellor from 1628 to 1635, bishop of Kraków from 1635, diplomat, szlachcic, magnate in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His coat of arms was &quot;Korab&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born in Drużbin, Poddębice County, Poland. In 1626, Jakub Zadzik was instrumental in convincing the Sejm in Toruń to increase taxes in order to generate funds for the war against Sweden and to create a commission for reformation of the military treasury. 

He negotiated the Treaty of Altmark in 1629 and the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś in 1635 with Sweden, which ended the Polish-Swedish War, and the Treaty of Polanów with Russia in 1634, ending the Smolensk War. 

He was a dedicated Catholic and a supporter of the Counter-Reformation. In 1638 he succeeded in closing the Polish Brethren center in Raków. He often opposed Władysław IV Waza, especially his actions designed to regain the throne of Sweden and strengthen the powers of the monarchy by means of military action.

Zadzik sponsored the Cracow Bishops&#x27; Palace in Kielce, now a museum.

<text>Taylors Arm is a village in the Nambucca Valley in New South Wales, Australia.

==History==
When its main industries of cedar felling and dairying were at their peak the small village of Taylors Arm was thriving. It had a boarding house built around 1890, then five years later the pub was built. Taylors Arm Post Office opened on 1 August 1891. Other stores were built including a bakery, butchery and a grocery store. There were apparently seven schools from Thumb Creek to Macksville. Medlow Primary School at Upper Taylors Arm now has approximately 30 students.

===Pub with No Beer===
Gordon Parsons (Australian country music singer) is believed to have written the song &quot;The Pub With No Beer&quot; based on the original poem &quot;The Pub Without Beer&quot; written by Dan Sheahan of Ingham, North Queensland.

In 1943 Sheahan was a local cane farmer and rode 20 miles to his local pub in Ingham, the Day Dawn Hotel owned by the Harvey family. When Sheahan arrived Gladys Harvey told him that the American troops stationed near Ingham during the war had drunk the entire month&#x27;s allocation of beer - beer being rationed during WW2. Sheahan rode home dry and wrote the poem. The original Day Dawn Hotel in Ingham was partially demolished and was replaced by Lees Hotel which still stands to this day.

The original poem by Sheahan was published in Ben Bowyangs column in the NQ Register in 1944.

In 1956, Gordon Parsons was performing his version of the song at the Taylors Arm Hotel when Slim Dusty asked if he could record it. Parsons passed the song on to Slim Dusty who needed a song for a B side of his record Saddle Boy.

==Environment==
Taylors Arm and surrounding area has an undulating landscape, State Forest, National Parks and Thumb Creek to Taylors Arm river, that consists of some very inviting water holes in the hot summer. On entry into the quiet village, an avenue of Paulownia trees is set in the foreground with blue mountains in the background.

Camping is available on the Reserve for a small fee. There are tennis courts, cricket pitch and barbecue facilities. The Rusty Bell store is open 7 days 7 am – 5 pm (now closed) owned by a third generation resident of Taylors Arm. There is no coverage for mobile phones in Taylors Arm. However, by 2018, a government programme named &quot;The Mobile Black Spot Programme&quot; will have provided funds for the largest telecommunications company in Australia, Telstra to construct a base station in Taylors Arm in which will provide 3G and 4G services.

The main industry today is beef cattle, dairy cattle, organic crops, cedar wood works, lemon myrtle, and smaller cottage industries.

<doc id="937472" wikidata="Q641521" url="?curid=937472" title="Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends">
<text>Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends is an American animated television series created by Craig McCracken for Cartoon Network. It was produced by Cartoon Network Studios as the network&#x27;s first show animated primarily with Adobe Flash, which was done both by Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank and in Ireland by Boulder Media. Set in a world in which imaginary friends coexist with humans, the series centers on Mac, an eight-year-old boy who is pressured by his mother to abandon his imaginary friend Bloo. After the duo discover an orphanage dedicated to housing abandoned imaginary friends, Bloo moves into the home and is kept from adoption as long as Mac visits him every day. The episodes revolve around Mac and Bloo as they interact with other imaginary friends and house staff and live out their day-to-day adventures, often getting caught up in various predicaments.

McCracken conceived the series with his partner Lauren Faust after they adopted two dogs from an animal shelter and applied the concept to imaginary friends. The series first premiered on Cartoon Network on August 13, 2004, as a 90-minute television film. On August 20, it began its normal run of 22-minute episodes on the &quot;Fridays&quot; block. The series finished its run on May 3, 2009, with a total of 6 seasons and 79 episodes. McCracken left Cartoon Network shortly after the series ended.

&quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; received critical acclaim for its animation, humor, writing, characters, and music. It became one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s most successful original series and received numerous industry accolades, including five Annie Awards and seven Emmy Awards, winning a total of 12 awards out of 35 nominations. It has since been named by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of the best Cartoon Network shows and by &quot;IGN&quot; in their list of best animated series at number 85.

A spinoff, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Funtime for Imaginary Friends&quot;, announced as having begun development on July 18, 2022, and greenlit to series on June 12, 2024, produced by Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe with Craig McCracken returning as the creator. The spinoff, aimed at a preschool audience, features a new cast of young imaginary friends, along with Bloo and Madame Foster from the original series.

==Premise==
&quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; is set in a universe in which childhood imaginary friends take physical form and become real as soon as children imagine them. Once children outgrow them, friends are relocated to the titular orphanage, where they stay until other children adopt them. The home is run by the elderly Madame Foster, its lovable, kind founder; her rabbit imaginary friend Mr. Herriman, the strict rule-abider and business manager; and her granddaughter Frankie, who handles day-to-day operations.

Because his mother believes he is too old for imaginary friends, eight-year-old Mac is pressured by her to abandon his imaginary friend, Bloo. When Mac takes Bloo to Foster&#x27;s after seeing a television advertisement, they discover that if Bloo were to live there, he would be available to be adopted by another child. Mac then bargains with Frankie, Herriman, and Madame Foster until they agree to guard Bloo from adoption so long as Mac continues to visit the center daily. Mac continues to visit the home every day after school to experience the escapades of the mischievous Bloo and the array of eccentric, colorful characters inhabiting Foster&#x27;s and the obstacles with which they are challenged.

==Characters==

===Main===
* Mac (voiced by Sean Marquette) – A bright and imaginative eight-year-old boy who is Bloo&#x27;s creator and best friend. Mac visits Foster&#x27;s every day. He is very attached to Bloo and his biggest fear is never seeing him again. Mac is often the voice of reason among his friends when they are making decisions. Mac becomes extremely hyperactive when he eats sugar. He also is attracted to Frankie.
* Bloo (voiced by Keith Ferguson) – Mac&#x27;s imaginary best friend. Bloo is a blue, supple, domed cylinder not unlike a bollard with two eyes. He is often self-centered and egotistical, with a knack for getting in trouble. Despite all this, Bloo apologizes for his actions. He loves paddle balls and claims to be the best at them, despite not making the ball hit the paddle.
* Wilt (voiced by Phil LaMarr) – A very tall, friendly and incredibly nice imaginary friend with only a right arm and a crooked left eye-stalk. His overtly passive demeanor is often taken advantage of by the other imaginary friends. He is a basketball player and fan, and is the former imaginary friend of Jordan Michaels (a parody of Michael Jordan). Wilt&#x27;s left arm got crushed during a basketball game where he saved Jordan from getting hurt, and a ball hit the back of his left eye after the final point was scored that cost them the game, permanently leaving the eye-stalk crooked. Fearing the latter would be disappointed by how they lost, he left Jordan. Three decades later, Wilt goes on a search to re-encounter him, learning he felt guilty over his imaginary friend&#x27;s injuries and was grateful to have been saved.
* Eduardo (voiced by Tom Kenny) – A Latin American monster created by a young girl, Nina Valerosa, to protect her in a dangerous neighborhood. Eduardo is big, hairy and purple, and has horns, a snout, a pointy demon-like tail, and large teeth. Despite his large size, overwhelming strength, and menacing appearance, Eduardo is docile, timid and scared of almost anything. However, he can be ferocious if angered or when danger befalls his friends.
* Coco (voiced by Candi Milo) – A chicken-like friend with a palm tree-like head who can only say or write her name. She has the ability to lay colorful, plastic eggs containing a plethora of objects, at will. Other characters usually understand her when she speaks. Despite her appearance and behavior, she can demonstrate intelligence and kindness. Her creator is unknown, as she was found on a South Pacific island by two scientists named Adam and Douglas.
* Francis &quot;Frankie&quot; Foster (voiced by Grey DeLisle) – Madame Foster&#x27;s 22-year-old redheaded granddaughter who is referred to as &quot;Miss Frances&quot; by Mr. Herriman. Frankie is the caregiver at Foster&#x27;s and helps keep everything in order. She is usually very friendly, easygoing, hard-working, caring, and sweet, but occasionally loses her patience with Bloo and Mr. Herriman. According to her driver&#x27;s license, she was born on July 25, 1984.
* Mr. Herriman (voiced by Tom Kane) – A gray and white elderly anthropomorphic lop ear rabbit friend imagined by Madame Foster who speaks with an English accent. He wears a tailcoat, white gloves, a top hat, and a monocle. He presents himself as head of business affairs of the house and later as President of the house, and is extremely strict about rules and the maintenance of order in the home. He frequently punishes Bloo for his various misdemeanors and scolds Frankie for her perceived laziness, despite all her hard work.
* Madame Foster (voiced by Candi Milo) – The caring founder of Foster&#x27;s and grandmother of Frankie. She is the creator of Mr. Herriman. Despite being elderly, Madame Foster has childlike boundless energy and occasionally becomes hyperactive and mischievous.

Other recurring characters include Terrence (voiced by Tara Strong), Mac&#x27;s older brother who constantly bullies him; Duchess (also voiced by Grey DeLisle), a friend with a Cubist-looking face and a pompous, narcissistic personality; Cheese (also voiced by Candi Milo), a dim-witted and childish yellow friend who first appeared in season two; and Goo (also voiced by Grey DeLisle), a talkative young girl who is highly imaginative and constantly creates new friends, first appearing in season three.

==Episodes==

==Production==

The series was created by Craig McCracken, who had also created &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; for Cartoon Network. McCracken developed the idea for the series after adopting two dogs from an animal shelter with his then-fiancée Lauren Faust and Mike Moon; he adapted the concept of pet adoption to that of imaginary friends. The show has an art style which is meant to evoke, according to McCracken, &quot;that period of late 60&#x27;s psychedelia when Victorian stylings were coming into trippy poster designs&quot;. McCracken wanted &quot;Foster&#x27;s&quot; to be similar to &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, which he believed was a &quot;fun, character driven show that the whole family could enjoy&quot;.
Animation for the show was done using a process involving Adobe software Illustrator, Flash and After Effects. McCracken directed, executive produced and story edited the series. Most of the episodes were produced at the Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank, California, while the rest were produced at Boulder Media Limited in Dublin, Ireland. The theme song was composed by James L. Venable, who had originally collaborated with McCracken on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. Craig described the music as &quot;psychedelic ragtime&quot;. Additional music was composed by Venable and Jennifer Kes Remington.

Collette Sunderman was the casting and recording director for the show. Sean Marquette was cast as Mac, and Keith Ferguson was cast as Bloo. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; voice actors Tom Kane, Tom Kenny and Tara Strong were cast in &quot;Foster&#x27;s&quot; as Mr. Herriman, Eduardo and Terrence, respectively. Grey DeLisle was cast as Frankie Foster, Phil LaMarr was cast as Wilt, and Candi Milo was cast as Coco and Madame Foster. From season two onwards, Milo also lent her voice to Cheese. DeLisle also voiced Goo after the character&#x27;s debut in season three.

&quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; premiered on August 13, 2004, as a 90-minute special titled &quot;House of Bloo&#x27;s&quot;. The series&#x27; run began on August 20 on its normal timeslot of Fridays at 7:00 PM. The special was Cartoon Network&#x27;s highest-rated premiere at the time. 18 shorts were produced from 2006 to 2007. In addition to the premiere episode, two other specials were produced: &quot;Good Wilt Hunting&quot;, which premiered on November 23, 2006, and &quot;&quot;, which premiered on November 27, 2008. The final episode, titled &quot;Goodbye to Bloo&quot;, aired on May 3, 2009, preceded by a 6-hour marathon of other episodes from the series. McCracken expressed a certain sadness at the series&#x27; end, but stated that he was &quot;crazy proud of the work&quot; that he and the production team had done &quot;on Foster&#x27;s and the fact that it worked just the way [they] wanted it to&quot;. During its original run, &quot;Foster&#x27;s&quot; was one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s highest-rated shows. The show proved to be popular among both younger and older audiences.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; received critical acclaim and became one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s most successful original series. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the series&#x27; premiere -hour episode and stated that the series would promise to be an &quot;admirable tale of loyalty and adventure-based learning with a contagious sense of fun&quot;. Mike Pinsky, in a review on &quot;DVD Verdict&quot;, praised the art design and the characterizations, particularly singling out Cheese as possibly &quot;the quintessence of Foster&#x27;s surreal charm&quot; in his Season 2 review. David Cornelius of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; called the series &quot;one of the best shows of any kind [then] on television, a winner for viewers of any age&quot; and &quot;a wildly inventive mix of creative wonder, comic genius, and well-crafted chaos&quot;. In a Season 2 review, also on &quot;DVD Talk&quot;, Cornelius called the show &quot;flat-out perfect&quot;. Joly Herman of Common Sense Media, an advocacy group focused on appropriate technology and media for children, was less enthusiastic about the show, rating it 2 stars out of 5. Herman praised the creativity and diversity of the characters and the show&#x27;s premise, but criticized the storyline and writing, which presented &quot;confusing messages&quot; for young children.

The series was named the 85th best animated series of all time in a list of the top 100 animated series by &quot;IGN&quot;, which called it very funny and endearing. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named the show the sixth best Cartoon Network show in their top 10 list, praising its &quot;catchy magical-realist setting&quot; and the characters &quot;you genuinely learned to care about&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; received many industry accolades. The series received 12 awards out of a total of 35 nominations. At the Annie Awards, the show received a total of 20 nominations from 2004 to 2009, and won 5, including Best Animated Television Production in 2007. At the Emmy Awards, the show received nine nominations, and won seven awards, including five Outstanding Individual Achievements in Animation and one Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More) award. At the 2005 Pulcinella Awards, &quot;Foster&#x27;s&quot; received the award for Best TV Series for All Audiences and Bloo was named &quot;Best Character of the Year.&quot; At the 22nd TCA Awards, the show received a nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Children&#x27;s Programming. At the 2007 Ottawa International Animation Festival, the series won Best Television Animation for Children.

==Merchandising and media==

===Video games===
There are 2 video games based on &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;. The first has the same name as the show and was developed by Collision Studios and published by Crave Entertainment for the Game Boy Advance. It was released on October 17, 2006. In the game, players control Mac or Bloo while collecting items to complete objectives. Jack Devries of &quot;IGN&quot; rated it a 5 1/2 out of 10, stating that it &quot;falls short&quot; and is &quot;skippable&quot;. The second game, titled &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends: Imagination Invaders&quot;, was developed by Sensory Sweep and published by Midway on November 12, 2007, for the Nintendo DS. In the game, the player controls Bloo, who performs tasks and completes quests while fighting against &quot;Space Nut Boogies&quot;. Devries rated it 4 out of 10, calling it &quot;terrible to play&quot; and &quot;completely worthless&quot;. Characters from the show also appear on the games &quot;Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion&quot; and &quot;FusionFall&quot;.

On May 15, 2006, Cartoon Network introduced an online game, &quot;Big Fat Awesome House Party&quot;, which allowed players to create an online friend to join Bloo and the others in a one-year game online, earning points that would give them gifts, cards and other online &quot;merchandise&quot; for their albums. A player&#x27;s friend, made from one of over 900,000 possible characters, could wind up in a future episode of &quot;Foster&#x27;s&quot;. Over 13 million users were registered to play the game after its launch in May 2006. Because of its success and popularity, Cartoon Network announced in May 2007 that the game would continue for six more months, into November of that year.

===Promotions and products===
From 2006 to 2008, Cartoon Network made a &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; float as part of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. The float was fashioned as a replica of the home. On Thanksgiving Day, 2006, characters from the show performed the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. In 2007, the characters performed &quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot; by Queen. In 2008, the characters&#x27; performance of Harry Nilsson&#x27;s theme song to &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; later reused for &quot;Rob &amp; Big&quot; was interrupted by Rick Astley singing &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, reproducing the Internet phenomenon of Rickrolling.

In 2006, the network promoted the show with billboards that read &quot;I pooted&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a hot toe picker&quot; (as said by Cheese and Bloo, respectively) in about 25 cities within the United States, one being placed next to Interstate 40/85 through Greensboro, North Carolina. Some time later, one of the &quot;I pooted&quot; billboards (along U.S. Route 29) was taken down due to concerns by the North Carolina A&amp;T State University. One of their associates, who claimed the advertisement did not represent their purpose and mission, said that &quot;some people didn&#x27;t understand if this was something in connection with the university.&quot; Both parties came to an agreement, and the billboard was replaced with one that read &quot;Shiny, shiny. Pretty, pretty&quot;, a line from the cartoon &quot;My Gym Partner&#x27;s a Monkey&quot;.

In March 2006, toys of characters from the show were featured in Burger King&#x27;s Kids Meals. In December 2007, Cartoon Network and Hot Topic retail stores in the United States set up a boutique for a product line based on the series, with over 693 locations featuring products such as clothing, accessories and DVD releases by Warner Home Video.

===Home media===
The episodes from the series are available for digital purchase on iTunes and Amazon Video, with the exception of the Christmas special. The show&#x27;s second season was available on Netflix until March 2015. All 6 seasons were added to Hulu in May 2015 until its removal from the service on October 1, 2022. The show was available to watch on HBO Max from May 2020 until it was removed in May 2023.

<doc id="937479" wikidata="Q665469" url="?curid=937479" title="Tropical cyclone warnings and watches">
<text>Tropical cyclone warnings and watches are alerts issued by national weather forecasting bodies to coastal areas threatened by the imminent approach of a tropical cyclone of tropical storm or hurricane intensity. They are notices to the local population and civil authorities to make appropriate preparation for the cyclone, including evacuation of vulnerable areas where necessary. It is important that interests throughout the area of an alert make preparations to protect life and property, and do not disregard it on the strength of the detailed forecast track.

==Western hemisphere==
New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.
In conjunction with the National Hurricane Center, the national meteorological and hydrological services of Central America, the northern Atlantic Ocean, and the northeastern Pacific Ocean east of the 140th meridian west, excluding mainland Africa and Europe, all issue tropical storm/hurricane watches and warnings. Tropical storm watches are issued when gale and storm force winds of between 34 and 63 knots (39–73 mph; 63–118 km/h) are possible, within 48 hours in a specified area in association with a tropical, subtropical or post-tropical cyclone. These watches are upgraded to tropical storm warnings, when gale and storm force winds become expected to occur somewhere in the warning area within 36 hours. Hurricane watches are issued when sustained winds of are possible, within 48 hours in a specified area in association with a tropical, subtropical or post-tropical cyclone. These watches are upgraded to hurricane warnings, when hurricane-force winds become expected to occur somewhere in the warning area within 36 hours.

Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the hurricane watch and warnings are issued in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds, rather than in advance of the anticipated onset of hurricane-force winds. At times a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch can both be in effect due to uncertainties in the forecast. These watches and warnings are also issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center for the Hawaiian Islands and the Weather Forecast Office in Guam for parts of Micronesia but not for American Samoa due to an international agreement.

Within the United States an extreme wind warning is issued by the National Weather Service for any land areas that are expected to be impacted by a major (Category 3 or higher) hurricane and by sustained surface winds greater than or equal to 100 knots (115 mph; 185 km/h). The warning is issued just prior to when the strongest winds of the eyewall are expected to impact an area. The warning is to be issued for the smallest area possible, and be valid for times of two hours or less. It was developed in response to confusion resulting from the landfall of Hurricane Katrina. NWS offices in Jackson and New Orleans/Baton Rouge issued 11 tornado warnings for areas that would not experience an actual tornado, but would experience extreme wind speeds commonly associated with tornadoes. The extreme wind warning is now expected to be used in these situations.

In 2017, the National Hurricane Center introduced a new system of warnings and watches for storm surge, which would cover the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States. A storm surge watch would be issued when a life-threatening storm surge, associated with a potential or ongoing tropical, subtropical or post-tropical cyclone, is possible within the next 48 hours. These watches would be upgraded to storm surge warnings when there is a danger of life-threatening storm surge occurring within 36 hours. However, both watches and warnings may be issued earlier than specified if environmental conditions are expected to hamper preparations.

In Mexico, a color coded alert system is used to keep the public informed when a tropical cyclone or possible tropical cyclones poses a threat to the nation. The scale starts with blue at the bottom being minimal danger, then proceeds to a green alert, which means low level danger. A yellow alert signifies moderate danger, followed by an orange alert that means high danger level. The scale tops off with a red alert, the maximum level of danger.

===Canada===
In Canada, terminology is fairly similar to that of the United States, but there are a few differences:
*Watches are issued 36 hours prior to a tropical cyclone making landfall.
*Warnings are issued 24 hours prior to the tropical cyclone making landfall.
*If sustained winds 70 km/h and/or gusts 90 km/h or stronger are predicted, a conventional wind warning will be issued along with the tropical cyclone watches and warnings.
*A storm surge warning may be issued if abnormally high water levels are predicted.

==West Pacific systems==
===China===
A two-stage warning system was long-established in China for tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity of above. Nowadays, the use of this system is restricted to coastal waters only. Thus, warnings may be discontinued even if a cyclone is maintaining tropical storm intensity inland. Color-coded alerts (below) may be in effect independently of any two-stage warnings.

Later, China Meteorological Administration standardized the system for national use. This set is part of a larger warning system that covers other forms of severe weather conditions, such as extreme temperature, torrential rainfall, drought, etc.

==== Guangdong ====
Guangdong continued to set up the White typhoon alert for typhoon, indicating that tropical cyclones may affect the area within 48 hours. In some inland areas that are less affected by tropical cyclones (such as Qinghai, etc.), there is no typhoon warning signal, but when it is hit by tropical cyclones, a strong wind warning signal will be issued. The winds represented by each color are consistent with the typhoon warning signal.

Typhoon warning signals used in Guangzhou from June 1, 1995, to November 1, 2000: 

Typhoon warning signals used from November 1, 2000, to May 2006:

Typhoon warning signals used from June 1, 2006, to December 31, 2014:

Typhoon warning signals used since January 1, 2015:
===== Shenzhen =====
Shenzhen currently uses a different signal from Guangdong Province:

===== Zhuhai =====
Zhuhai adopts the signal style of Guangdong Province, but the meaning of the signal is different:

==== Ball signal ====
===== Shenzhen and Zhuhai =====
Shenzhen and Zhuhai used digitally arranged typhoon signals from June 4, 1994, to November 1, 2000, but they have now been replaced by typhoon warning signals.

===== Ports =====
The coastal ports of various cities in mainland China will still hang the squash signal when the typhoon hits. The sign is roughly the same as the typhoon signal used in Shenzhen and Zhuhai.

===Hong Kong and Macau===
The Pearl River Delta uses a variety of warning systems to inform the public regarding the risks of tropical cyclones to the area.

The Hong Kong Observatory issues typhoon signals to indicate the existence and effects of a tropical cyclone on Hong Kong. The first numeric warning system was used in 1917.

The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau in Macau uses a similar system.

In Hong Kong the typhoon signal system consists of 8 signals in 5 levels numbered non-consecutively for historical reasons. Each signal has a day signal and a night signal for hoisting, which are still hoisted in Macau but no longer hoisted in Hong Kong. Day signals are also used as signal symbols in both places.

===Japan===

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is the government agency responsible for gathering and providing results for the public in Japan, that are obtained from data based on daily scientific observation and research into natural phenomena in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, seismology and volcanology, among other related scientific fields. Its headquarters is located in Tokyo.

JMA is also designated one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC) of the World Meteorological Organization. It has the responsibility for weather forecasting, tropical cyclone naming and distribution of warnings for tropical cyclones in the Northwestern Pacific region.

===Philippines===
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) releases tropical cyclone warnings in the form of Tropical Cyclone Wind Signals (TCWS, or &quot;wind signals&quot;). Within this warning system, an area having a wind signal may be under:
*TCWS #1 - Tropical cyclone winds of 39–61 km/h are prevailing or expected within the next 36 hours.
*TCWS #2 - Tropical cyclone winds of 62–88 km/h are prevailing or expected within the next 24 hours.
*TCWS #3 - Tropical cyclone winds of 89–117 km/h are prevailing or expected within the next 18 hours.
*TCWS #4 - Tropical cyclone winds of 118–184 km/h are prevailing or expected within 12 hours.
*TCWS #5 - Tropical cyclone winds of 185 km/h or greater are prevailing or expected within 12 hours.
These wind signals are hoisted when an area (in the Philippines only) is about to be directly affected by tropical cyclone winds. Wind signals for specific areas can be escalated to higher signal levels (and the lead times shortened consequently) as a tropical cyclone gains strength and/or gets closer to the areas about to be affected. De-escalation and/or lifting of wind signals are implemented once a tropical cyclone weakens and/or gets farther away from the affected areas. The lead time is also only valid for the first issuance.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam recognises its typhoon season from the beginning of June through to the end of November, with an average of four to six typhoons hitting the country annually. Any tropical cyclones here are monitored by the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF), which is the nation&#x27;s official meteorological agency and was established in January 2003. The NCHMF tracks a storm should it enter the agency&#x27;s monitoring area range which is within the East Sea to the west of 120°E and north of 5°N. Any storm that enters this area is assigned a number, and is set according to its sequence of its occurrence – as for instance with Bão số 1 etc., which translates to &quot;Storm no. 1&quot;. &quot;Bão&quot; comes from &quot;暴&#x27;, meaning ferocious, violent or vicious, but in vernacular Vietnamese has come to mean &quot;storm&quot;.

In 2014, the Vietnamese government issued Decree no.44/2014, introduced five warning levels, but NCHMF only use three out of five levels to issue typhoon warnings:

* Orange-decorated &quot;Level 3 disaster risk alert&quot; (High alert)
* Red-decorated &quot;Level 4 disaster risk alert&quot; (Very high alert)
* Pink-decorated &quot;Level 5 disaster risk alert&quot; (Disaster alert)
== South Pacific basin ==
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology will issue a cyclone watch for a specified part of Australia, when a tropical cyclone is expected to cause gale-force winds in excess of within 24–48 hours and subsequently make landfall. A cyclone warning is subsequently issued for a specified part of Australia when a tropical cyclone, is expected to cause or is causing gale-force winds in excess of within 24 hours and is subsequently expected to make landfall.

The Fiji Meteorological Service issues a tropical cyclone alert for the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Tokelau and Tuvalu, when a tropical cyclone has a significant probability of causing gale-force winds or stronger winds within 24–48 hours. Gale, storm and hurricane-force wind warnings are subsequently issued for the above areas by FMS, when a tropical cyclone is either causing or expected to cause either gale storm or hurricane-force winds within 24 hours.

Météo-France is responsible for the issuance of tropical cyclone watches and warnings for New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia and the Pitcairn Islands. The National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of the Solomon Islands, Samoa, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Timor Leste and American Samoa are responsible for their own watches and warnings.

==Indian Ocean systems==
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD/RSMC New Delhi) is responsible for tracking tropical cyclones within the North Indian Ocean.
Météo-France in Réunion (MFR/RSMC La Réunion) is responsible for the issuing advisories and tracking of tropical cyclones in the southwest part of the basin, however, the naming of systems is deferred to the Mauritius and Madagascar weather services.

===India===

The IMD issues warnings in four stages for the Indian coast. 
* Stage 1: Cyclone watch - Issued 72 hours in advance, it discusses the likelihood of development of a cyclonic disturbance in the north Indian Ocean and the coastal region likely to experience adverse weather.
* Stage 2: Cyclone alert - Issued 48 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas.
* Stage 3: Cyclone warning - Issued 24 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas. The location of landfall is discussed at this stage.
* Stage 4: Landfall outlook - Issued 12 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas. The track of the cyclone after the landfall and the possible impact inland is discussed at this stage.

Cyclonic storm conditions mean what winds in excess of 63 km/h (39 mph) are possible.

===Mauritius===
Mauritius Meteorological Services is responsible for naming tropical systems in the South-West Indian Ocean between 55°E and 90°E. They issue four different levels of cyclone warnings for the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues.
* Class I cyclone warnings are issued 36 to 48 hours before the islands are affected by wind gusts of at least 120 km/h (75 mph).
* Class II cyclone warnings are issued when there are 12 hours of daylight left before gusts of 120 km/h (75 mph) affect the islands.
* Class III cyclone warnings are issued when there are 6 hours of daylight left before gusts of 120 km/h (75 mph) affect the islands.
* Class IV cyclone warnings are issued when gusts of at least 120 km/h (75 mph) are occurring in the islands.
* Safety Bulletin Issued for the purpose of: lifting the cyclone warning class III or cyclone warning class IV, as the case may be; and informing the public of the existence of any severe weather conditions associated with the cyclone and other environment risk, depending on the nature and extent of the damage occurred during the passage of the cyclone.
* Termination Issued when subsequent observations indicate that the risk of cyclonic gusts of 120 kilometres per hour has abated and the cyclone is moving away

===Réunion===
Météo-France issues five levels of alerts for the French overseas department and region of Réunion.
*Pre-alert/Yellow alert – issued when a tropical system may impact Réunion between 24 and 72 hours.
*Orange alert – issued when a tropical storm or cyclone may impact Réunion in the next 24 hours.
*Red alert – issued when a tropical storm or cyclone is impacting part or all of Réunion.
*Purple alert – issued when a major tropical cyclone with winds exceeding is impacting part or all of Réunion.
*Safeguard phase – issued when a tropical storm or cyclone is moving away from Réunion, but hazards relating to damage caused by the system, such as fallen trees, flooded roads, mudslides, and downed power lines, still remain.

==Military advisories==

===HURCON/TCCOR===

The United States Department of Defense uses a multi-stage system called the Hurricane Condition (HURCON) in the North Atlantic and the Northeast Pacific and the Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) in the western Pacific to prepare bases and evacuate assets and personnel in advance of adverse weather associated with tropical cyclones.

The alerts are recommended by weather facilities either on base or by central sites like the National Hurricane Center or the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and are generally related to the timing and potential for destructive sustained windspeeds of above . Recommendations are then considered by base or area commanders along with other subjective factors for setting the alert status like assets, holidays or the bases experience in emergency preparedness. The bases prefer to set these alerts sequentially, from HURCON or TCCOR 5 with destructive winds expected within 96 hours, through levels 4, 3, 2 and if needed to a series of four different level 1 conditions, however depending on the cyclone&#x27;s movement or location some of these signals can be skipped. After a system passes and stops affecting the base, the authorities can decide to revert to the lowest level or stay in a heightened approach if another tropical cyclone is approaching.

<text>Alternanthera is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a widespread genus with most species occurring in the tropical Americas, and others in Asia, Africa, and Australia. Plants of the genus may be known generally as joyweeds, or Joseph&#x27;s coat. Several species are notorious noxious weeds.

==Description==
These are annual or perennial herbs or subshrubs. While some of the better-known species are aquatic plants, most are terrestrial. They take many forms, from prostrate to erect to floating. The leaves are oppositely arranged. The inflorescence is a spike or a rounded head occurring in the leaf axils or the ends of branches. The flowers have 5 tepals. There are 3 to 5 stamens which are fused into a rim at the bases, and 5 pseudostaminodes, appendages between the stamens that are not true staminodes. The fruit is a utricle containing one seed.

The genus &quot;Alternanthera&quot; contains both terrestrial and aquatic species. The photosynthetic pathway varies in this genus: Some species undergo C3 carbon fixation, one clade of 17 species has acquired the C4 pathway, and yet other species have an intermediate C3-C4 pathway.

==Species==


It is not yet clear how many species belong in the genus. Estimates range between 80 and 200. &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; accepts 106 species.

As of April 2024, Plants of the World Online accepts the following species:

==Ecology==
Many species have been reported as noxious weeds, including &quot;A. angustifolia&quot;, &quot;A. caracasana&quot;, &quot;A. denticulata&quot;, &quot;A. nana&quot;, &quot;A. nodiflora&quot;, &quot;A. paronychioides&quot;, &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot;, &quot;A. sessilis&quot;, &quot;A. tenella&quot;, and &quot;A. triandra&quot;. The most important species is alligator weed (&quot;A. philoxeroides&quot;), a South American aquatic plant that has spread to other continents. It is a weed of many kinds of agricultural crops, it is an invasive species that degrades native habitat, and its dense mats of vegetation clog waterways, slowing shipping and increasing flooding. &quot;Alternanthera&quot; plants are known to produce allelopathic compounds that injure other plants, including crops.

Biological pest control agents now in use to reduce alligator weed infestations include the alligator weed flea beetle (&quot;Agasicles hygrophila&quot;), the alligator weed thrips (&quot;Amynothrips andersoni&quot;), and the alligator weed stem borer (&quot;Arcola malloi&quot;).

==Uses==
&quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; and &quot;A. sessilis&quot; are eaten as vegetables in parts of Asia.

Some &quot;Alternanthera&quot; are used as ornamental plants.

<text>Prince Jerzy Ossoliński h. Topór (15 December 1595 – 9 August 1650) was a Polish nobleman (&quot;szlachcic&quot;), Crown Court Treasurer from 1632, governor (&quot;voivode&quot;) of Sandomierz from 1636, &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; (Imperial Prince) since 1634, Crown Deputy Chancellor from 1639, Great Crown Chancellor from 1643, sheriff (&quot;starost&quot;) of Bydgoszcz (1633), Lubomel (1639), Puck and Bolim (1647), magnate, politician, statesman and diplomat. Famous for being extensively educated, he was a skillful politician and a persuasive public speaker.

He is the founder of the Baroque church in Klimontów.

== Biography ==

He was sent with diplomatic missions to the Pope in Rome in 1633. He negotiated with Brandenburgians of Duchy of Prussia in 1635 and led another diplomatic mission to Emperor Ferdinand II and his parliament in Regensburg (Polish: &quot;Ratyzbona&quot;) in 1636. As a leader of the pro-Habsburg faction at the royal court, he found an ally in the first wife of Władysław IV Waza, Cecilia Renata of Austria, daughter of Ferdinand II. In 1639 and 1641 he once again negotiated with envoys from the Duchy of Prussia. A Catholic, he opposed Protestants and advocated limiting their rights and privileges. In his pro-Habsburg and anti-Protestant stance he was allied with Chancellor Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł and Queen Cecilia Renata.

In 1643 he was appointed Chancellor of the Crown. A close royal adviser, he often supported king Władysław IV Waza from the House of Vasa, arguing for increasing monarch power, although he was known for limiting and withdrawing his support if he knew it was impossible to win. Nonetheless, he was among the few who supported Władysław&#x27;s plans in the late 1640s to wage an offensive war on the Ottoman Empire. He had few friends among the lesser szlachta, whom he mostly disliked and treated the Sejm and regional sejmiks as a &#x27;necessary evil&#x27;, although he rarely broke any laws.

From 1644 he switched his alignment from pro-Habsburg to pro-French and supported the second marriage of King Władysław with Ludwika Maria Gonzaga. During his life he became the enemy of Adam Kazanowski and Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, whose power diminished with the marriage between Władysław and Cecylia in 1637. Rival of bishop and chancellor Piotr Gembicki, whom he eventually forced to retire from politics in 1642, receiving his position of Great Crown Chancellor.

He was not the wealthiest of magnates, his possessions were very small compared to those of Radziwiłłs or Wiśniowieckis, but almost none of them were mortgaged or loaned. In 1635 he funded the expansion of his family castle in Ossolin. Between 1639 and 1642 he funded the palace in the capital city of Warsaw.

After the death of Władysław IV in 1648 he supported the election of his half brother John Casimir and was instrumental in his election.

Ossoliński also was in favour of treaties with the Cossacks, he took part in the negotiations and was an important contributor to the Treaty of Zborów in 1649.

He was a well regarded speaker and orator (he served twice as the Speaker of the Sejm in 1631 and 1635).

He was also an author of:
* &quot;Orationess...&quot; (1647)
* &quot;Mercurius Sarmatiae&quot; (1716)
* &quot;Pamiętnik&quot; (&quot;The Diary&quot; or &quot;Memoires&quot;) 1595–1621 (1952)
He also wrote the diaries of the embassy to Germany (1877) and to Rome (1883).

Brother of Krzysztof Ossoliński (1587–1645), voivode of Sandomierz (1638), and Maksymilian Ossoliński (1588–1665), chorąży sandomierski (1624), Deputy Court Treasurer.

<text>The Currency Act or Paper Bills of Credit Act is one of several Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain that regulated paper money issued by the colonies of British America. The Acts sought to protect British merchants and creditors from being paid in depreciated colonial currency. The policy created tension between the colonies and Great Britain and was cited as a grievance by colonists early in the American Revolution. However, the consensus view among modern economic historians and economists is that the debts by colonists to British merchants were not a major cause of the Revolution. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 92% of economists and 74% of historians disagreed with the statement, &quot;The debts owed by colonists to British merchants and other private citizens constituted one of the most powerful causes leading to the Revolution.&quot;

==Economic climate of the colonies==

From their origin, the colonies struggled with the development of an effective medium of exchange for goods and services. After depleting the vast majority of their monetary resources through imports, the first settlers strained to keep money in circulation. They could not find a suitable medium of exchange in which the value did not depreciate. The colonists generally employed three main types of currency. The first was commodity money, using the staple of a given region as a means of exchange. The second was specie, or gold or silver money. Lastly, paper money (or fiat money), issued in the form of a bill of exchange or a banknote, mortgaged on the value of the land that an individual owned.

Each year, the supply of specie in the colonies decreased due to international factors. The dearth of specie rendered it ineffective as a means of exchange for day-to-day purchases. Colonists frequently adopted a barter system to acquire the goods and services they required. Essentially, this method proved to be ineffective and a commodity system was adopted in its place. Tobacco was used as a monetary substitute in Virginia as early as 1619. A major shortcoming of this system was that the quality of the substitutes was inconsistent. The poorer qualities ended up in circulation while the finer qualities were inevitably exported. This commodity system became increasingly ineffective as colonial debts increased.

In 1690, Massachusetts became the first colony to issue paper currency. This currency was employed as a means to finance its share of the debt from King William&#x27;s War. Other colonies quickly followed suit, and by 1715 ten of the thirteen had resorted to the issuance of paper currency. Economist Stanley Finkelstein highlights the advantage of paper currency, &quot;that unless it is backed by specie it is cost-free currency&quot;. The paper currency depreciated quickly because the colonies printed more than what was taxed out of circulation. By 1740, Rhode Island bills of exchange were only four percent of face value and those of Massachusetts was eleven percent. The money supply was growing at a much faster rate than that of the overall colonial economy, which led to hyperinflation and the corresponding reduction in purchasing power per unit of money. British merchants were forced to accept this depreciated currency as a repayment of debts. This led to the Currency Act 1751.

==Currency Act 1751==

The first act, the (24 Geo. 2. c. 53), restricted the issue of paper money and the establishment of new public banks by the colonies of New England. These colonies had issued paper fiat money known as &quot;bills of credit&quot; to help pay for military expenses during the French and Indian Wars. Because more paper money was issued than what was taxed out of circulation, the currency depreciated in relation to the British pound sterling. The resultant inflation was harmful to merchants in Great Britain, who were forced to accept the depreciated currency from colonists for payment of debts.

The act limited the future issue of bills of credit to certain circumstances. It allowed the existing bills to be used as legal tender for public debts (i.e. paying taxes), but did not allow their use for private debts (e.g. for paying merchants).

==Currency Act 1764==

The (4 Geo. 3. c. 34) extended the 1751 act to all of the British colonies of North America. Unlike the earlier act, this statute did not prohibit the colonies from issuing paper money, but it did forbid them from designating future currency issues as legal tender for public and private debts. This tight money policy created financial difficulties in the colonies, where gold and silver were in short supply. Benjamin Franklin, a colonial agent in London, lobbied for repeal of the act over the next several years, as did other agents. The act arose when Virginia farmers continued to import during the French and Indian War. Virginia issued £250,000 in bills of credit to finance both public and private debts. This legislation differed from the 1751 act in that it prohibited the colonists from designating paper currency for use as payment for any debts, public or private. Parliament did not, however, prohibit the colonists from issuing paper money. The act was put into place as a hedge against risks associated with economic fluctuations and uncertainty.

The colonial government of the Province of New York insisted that the Currency Act prevented it from providing funds for British troops in compliance with the Quartering Act 1765. As a result, in 1770, Parliament gave permission in the &#x27; (10 Geo. 3. c. 35) for New York to issue £120,000 in paper currency for public but not private debts. Parliament extended these concessions to the other colonies in 1773 via the &#x27; (13 Geo. 3. c. 57) by amending the Currency Act 1764, permitting the colonies to issue paper currency as legal tender for public debts. According to historian Jack Sosin, the British government had made its point:

==Legacy==
Currency Acts created tension between the colonies and the mother country, and were a contributing factor in the coming of the American Revolution. In all of the colonies except Delaware, the acts were considered to be a &quot;major grievance&quot;. When the First Continental Congress met in 1774, it issued a Declaration of Rights, which outlined colonial objections to certain acts of Parliament. Congress called on Parliament to repeal the Currency Act 1764, one of seven acts labeled &quot;subversive of American rights&quot;.

However, according to historians Jack Greene and Richard Jellison, the currency debate was no longer really a &quot;live issue&quot; in 1774, due to the 1773 amendment of the act. The controversy&#x27;s most important impact was psychological, in that it helped convince many colonists that Parliament did not understand or care about their problems. Colonial leaders came to believe that they, rather than Parliament, were better suited to legislate for the colonies.

<text>Les Colocs (The Roommates) were a Quebec rock band formed in Montreal in 1990 by singer-songwriter André &quot;Dédé&quot; Fortin. Known for their energetic performances and eclectic fusion of musical styles, they blended rock with folk, swing, blues, and world music. Their lyrics, written in Quebec French, addressed social themes such as poverty, homelessness, HIV/AIDS, and consumerism while maintaining a lighthearted and humorous public image, which contributed to their widespread appeal.

==History==
The band gained prominence with their self-titled debut album, selling over 60,000 copies and establishing a reputation for combining sharp social commentary with catchy melodies. Despite frequent lineup changes, Fortin and guitarist Mike Sawatzky remained the core members. Following their 1995 album &quot;Atrocetomique&quot;, they expanded their sound by collaborating with Senegalese musicians the Diouf brothers on &quot;Dehors novembre&quot; (1998), an album noted for its introspective themes.

Although often perceived as a &quot;party band,&quot; Fortin later emphasized the importance of his lyrics, aiming to balance entertainment with social critique. He believed in writing from personal experience to create universally relatable songs, a method evident in tracks like &quot;La rue principale&quot; and &quot;Juste une p’tite nuite&quot;.

Fortin died by suicide on May 8, 2000, effectively ending the band. The remaining members released a final album, &quot;Suite 2116&quot;, before disbanding. Despite their relatively short career, &quot;Les Colocs&quot; remain an influential part of Quebec’s music history, recognized for their blend of social commentary and musical innovation.

<doc id="937498" wikidata="Q2419125" url="?curid=937498" title="Prince Mircea of Romania">
<text>Prince Mircea of Romania (; 3 January 19132 November 1916) was the third son and youngest child of King Ferdinand of Romania and Marie of Edinburgh and the great-grandson of Queen Victoria through his mother. He died aged 3 in November 1916.

==Birth==
Prince Mircea was born in Bucharest on , as the third son and youngest child of the Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania and the Crown Princess Marie of Edinburgh. He was baptised on at the Royal Palace (presently the National Museum of Art). Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia arrived by train to Bucharest to represent his father. He was met there by King Carol I, Crown Prince Ferdinand and Prince Carol. His godparents were the German Emperor Wilhelm II, King Carol I, Queen Elisabeth and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia. His mother, the Crown Princess, was absent due to a possible attack of phlebitis. During his short life, he was known to get along very well with his sister, Princess Ileana of Romania. His governess was Mary Green.

==Death==
Prince Mircea died at Buftea on 2 November 1916 of typhoid fever during a time of war when the enemy troops were approaching Bucharest and many battles were taking place close to the city. The royal family had to quickly bury him on the grounds of Cotroceni Palace, before they went into retreat to Iași, the old capital of Moldavia, the unoccupied part north-eastern Romania. His death certificate was partially burnt. His original tombstone read:

In 1920, Mircea&#x27;s eldest brother, the future Carol II, named his child with Zizi Lambrino Mircea Grigore, in memory of Prince Mircea who had died just four years earlier. In 1941, Mircea was reburied, at the request of Princess Ileana, from Cotroceni to the little chapel of Bran Castle, close to the burial place of Marie&#x27;s heart. 

In January 2018, it was announced that the remains of King Carol II will be moved to the new Archdiocesan and Royal Cathedral, along with those of Queen Mother Helen. In addition, the remains of Prince Mircea will also be moved to the new cathedral.

==Etymology==
&quot;Mircea&quot; is an exclusively Romanian-used name that is derived from the Old Slavic &quot;mir&quot; meaning &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;world&quot;. 

Prince Mircea was named after Mircea I of Wallachia, a medieval Romanian Prince of Wallachia who organised a vigorous resistance to the Turks in the 14th century, and whose troops fought side by side with the Serbians on the fatal field of Kossovo.

==Ancestry==
==Notes==

* The most common used date is January 3, but the date on his first tomb had the Old Style date, 22 December 1912. 
* It was believed at the time that his biological father was Prince Barbu Știrbey and now most historians agree that this is true. 
* Mary Green was also the governess of his sister, Princess Ileana and his brother, Prince Nicholas.

<doc id="937505" wikidata="Q1678520" url="?curid=937505" title="Jaguar Mark X">
<text>The Jaguar Mark X (Mark Ten), later renamed the Jaguar 420G, is a large, luxury saloon car manufactured by British automaker Jaguar Cars between 1961 to 1970. It succeeded the Mark IX as the top of its range, but radically broke with both its predecessor&#x27;s styling and technology.

From an industrial design viewpoint, the slab-sided but also somewhat &quot;fuselage&quot; shaped MarkTen was a hallmark car for Jaguar by introducing the upright, often slightly forward leaning front fascia and grille, flanked by prominent quad round headlights. When Jaguar replaced its entire saloon range with a more compact single new model in the late 1960s, the resulting XJ6 of 1968 used the Mark Ten as a template. 

Similar front grille and quad round headlight facias defined most of Jaguar&#x27;s saloons for nearly half a century, until 2009 – the final year of both the 3rd generation XJ series, and of the Jaguar X-Type. Also, Jaguar did not build another car as large as the Mark Ten &amp; 420G for the rest of the century, until the LWB version of the 2003 XJ Jaguars.

Introduced within a year of Jaguar&#x27;s iconic E-Type sportscar, the Mark X impressed by copying much of the E-Type&#x27;s technology, innovations and specification. Contrary to its predecessors, the car was modernised with integrated, unitary bodywork – the largest in the UK at the time – as well as with four-wheel disc brakes and Jaguar&#x27;s independent rear suspension with inboard brakes, unheard of for early 1960s British luxury cars. Combined with the 3.8-litre, triple carburettor engine as fitted to the E-type, it gave Jaguar&#x27;s lavishly appointed flagship capable handling and a top speed of at less than half the price of the contemporary Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud.

Despite press acclaim from both sides of the Atlantic and Jaguar&#x27;s hopes to appeal to heads of state, diplomats, and film stars, primarily aimed at the large, affluent U.S. market, the Mark X never achieved its sales targets. The rarest now is the Mark X with the 4.2 Ltr engine as only 5,137 were built and few are known to survive.

==Body==

In 1961 the Mark X introduced a new upright, and slightly forward-leaning nose design for Jaguar saloons, with four headlamps set into rounded front fenders (derived from Daimler DK400), and a vaned grill. This front-end style reappeared on many of the manufacturer&#x27;s successive saloons, up to and including the X-Type and third generation Jaguar XJ, &quot;both&quot; through 2009—thereby forging Jaguar saloons&#x27; look for almost half a century.

Instead of relying on body-on-frame construction, like its predecessors and most of its competitors, the Mark X received a unitary body-shell, codenamed &quot;Zenith&quot; during its development. Its floorpan remained in production in elongated form, long after Mark X production ended, forming the basis of the Daimler DS420 Limousine until 1992. But at the same time, the interior was Jaguar&#x27;s last to feature abundant standard woodwork, including the dashboard, escutcheons, window trim, a pair of large bookmatched fold out rear picnic tables, and a front seat pull-out picnic table stowed beneath the instrument cluster.

Later, air conditioning and a sound-proof glass division between the front and rear seats were added as options. The substantial doors required helical torsion springs inside the door pillars to enable them to be opened from the inside with an acceptably low level of effort.

From its introduction in mid-October 1961 until the arrival in 1992 of the low-slung XJ220 sports car, the Mark X stood as one of the widest production Jaguars ever built. Asked in 1972 if he thought the Mark X had grown rather too large, Jaguar chairman William Lyons, agreed that it &quot;definitely&quot; had: he opined that the then recently introduced and notably more compact Jaguar XJ6 was, by contrast an &quot;ideal size&quot;.

==Mechanical==
The Mark X was the first Jaguar saloon to feature independent rear suspension designed by William Heynes, who was Jaguar&#x27;s Technical Director and Chief Engineer. It differed from earlier large Jaguar saloons in having 14&quot; wheels instead of the more common 15&quot;. It used a wider-track version of Jaguar&#x27;s IRS unit first seen on the E Type, which was subsequently used on Jaguar vehicles until X308 production ended in 2003. The front suspension used double wishbones with coil springs and telescopic dampers.

Power initially came from the E-type&#x27;s version of Jaguar&#x27;s 3781 cc XK in-line six-cylinder engine designed by W Heynes, developing either or , depending on compression ratio. A 9:1 compression ratio was standard, but an alternative 8:1 compression ratio was available as an option. For the London Motor Show in October 1964 the enlarged 4,235 cc unit took over, although the 3.8-litre unit could still be specified until October 1965. Triple SU carburettors were fitted, fed from an AC Delco air filter mounted ahead of the right hand front wheel.

Transmission options were manual, manual with overdrive, or automatic . The arrival of the 4.2-litre power unit coincided with the introduction of a newly developed all-synchromesh four-speed gear box, replacing the venerable box inherited by the 3.8-litre Mark X from the Mark IX, which had featured synchromesh only on the top three ratios. Many domestic market cars and almost all cars destined for the important North American markets left the factory with a Borg Warner automatic gear-box. The 4.2-litre engine&#x27;s introduction was also marked by a transmission upgrade for buyers of the automatic cars, who saw the Borg Warner transmission system switched from a DG to a Type 8 unit. The power train was completed by a Thornton Powr-Lok limited-slip differential.

Stopping power for this heavy car came from power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, the rear units being mounted inboard alongside the differential.

Power-assisted steering was standard, the later 4.2 cars receiving Marles Varamatic Bendix (Adwest) variable ratio steering boxes, designed by an Australian, Arthur Bishop.
==420G==

For the London Motor Show in October 1966 the Mark X was renamed the Jaguar 420G (not to be confused with the smaller Jaguar 420). The 420G was distinct from the Mark X only with the addition of a vertical central bar splitting the grille in two, side indicator repeaters on the front wings, and a chrome strip along the wing and door panels (two tone paint schemes were also available with the chrome strip omitted).

Interior changes included perforations in the central sections of the leather seats, padded dashboard sections for safety, moving the clock to a central position, and the introduction of air conditioning as an option.

A limousine variant was available on the standard wheelbase; a fixed, one-piece seat back topped with a sliding glass partition replaced the separate chairs of standard cars.

Despite running for the same length of time as the Mark X (five years) the 420G sold in less than a third of the numbers. This lack of popularity and the increasing production of the smaller XJ6 resulted in the 420G being run out of production in 1970.

===Eight seater===

In 1968 British Leyland ended production of the Daimler limousine DR450 and the Vanden Plas Princess and chose to replace them by offering a extra-long wheelbase 420G with an eight-seater Hooper &quot;Empress Line&quot;-inspired (but still monocoque) body made by Vanden Plas. Aside from the shape of the rear part of the coachwork there was no link with Daimler cars made before Daimler became a subsidiary.

British Leyland&#x27;s &quot;Daimler DS420&quot; was announced in June 1968. Taller than the 420G the new car was nearly nineteen feet long and six feet six inches wide with &quot;majestic proportions&quot;. The rear compartment carried six people in comfort on the rear seats and three fold-away occasional seats. Sir William Lyons pointed out it was less than half the price of any of its competitors.

The 420G wheelbase was extended by 21&quot;, with the mechanical underpinnings of the car being subtly reconfigured. This eight-seater car was built until 1992 and used by many countries in official capacities. It was frequently used by funeral homes for carrying mourners or in modified form as a hearse.

== Scale models ==
A year after the Mark Ten&#x27;s launch, popular toy car maker Corgi Toys released their #238 scale model of it, to great popularity. From 1962 to 1967, over 1.1 million were sold, and hardly any other Corgi model was released in as many colours.

<doc id="937507" wikidata="Q171810" url="?curid=937507" title="Alanya">
<text>Alanya (; ), formerly Alaiye, is a beach resort city, a municipality and district of Antalya Province, Turkey. It is on the southern coast of Turkey, in the country&#x27;s Mediterranean Region, east of the city of Antalya. Its area is 1,577 km2, and its population is 364,180 (2022). The city proper has 189,222 inhabitants (2022).

Because of its natural strategic position on a small peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea below the Taurus Mountains, Alanya has been a local stronghold for many Mediterranean-based empires, including the Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. Alanya&#x27;s greatest political importance came in the Middle Ages, with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm under the rule of Alaeddin Kayqubad I, from whom the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city&#x27;s landmarks, such as the Kızıl Kule (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and Alanya Castle.

The Mediterranean climate, natural attractions, and historic heritage make Alanya a popular destination for tourism, and responsible for nine percent of Turkey&#x27;s tourism sector and thirty percent of foreign purchases of real estate in Turkey. Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population. Warm-weather sporting events and cultural festivals take place annually in Alanya. In 2014 Mayor Adem Murat Yücel, of the Nationalist Movement Party unseated Hasan Sipahioğlu, of the Justice and Development Party, who had previously led the city since 1999. Adem Murat Yücel has served two terms as the Mayor of Alanya, first elected in 2014 and then elected for a second time in 2019. In March 31st 2024 Turkish local elections Osman Tarık Özçelik of the Republican People&#x27;s Party has been elected as the new Mayor of Alanya, making an historic mark as the Republican People&#x27;s Party was able to win an election in the city after 74 years.

==Names==

The city has changed hands many times over the centuries, and its name has reflected this. Alanya was known in Latin as &quot;Coracesium&quot; or in Greek as &quot;Korakesion&quot; () from the Luwian &quot;Korakassa&quot; meaning &quot;point/protruding city&quot;. The Roman Catholic Church still recognizes the Latin name as a titular see in its hierarchy. Under the Byzantine Empire it became known as &quot;Kalonoros&quot; or &quot;Kalon Oros&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful/fine mountain&quot; in Greek. The Seljuks renamed the city &quot;Alaiye&quot; (علائیه), a derivative of the Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I&#x27;s name. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Italian traders called the city &quot;Candelore&quot; or &quot;Cardelloro&quot;. In his 1935 visit, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk finalized the name in the new alphabet as &quot;Alanya&quot;, changing the &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;e&#x27; in Alaiye, reportedly because of a misspelled telegram in 1933.

==History==
Finds in the nearby Karain Cave indicate occupation during the Paleolithic era as far back as , and archeological evidence shows a port existed at Syedra, south of the modern city, during the Bronze Age around . A Phoenician language tablet found in the district dates to , and the city is specifically mentioned in the 4th-century BC Greek geography manuscript, the periplus of Pseudo-Scylax. The castle rock was likely inhabited under the Hittites and the Achaemenid Empire, and was first fortified in the Hellenistic period following the area&#x27;s conquest by Alexander the Great. Alexander&#x27;s successors left the area to one of the competing Macedonian generals, Ptolemy I Soter, after Alexander&#x27;s death in . His dynasty maintained loose control over the mainly Isaurian population, and the port became a popular refuge for Mediterranean pirates. The city resisted Antiochus III the Great of the neighboring Seleucid kingdom in , but was loyal to the pirate Diodotus Tryphon when he seized the Seleucid crown from 142 to . His rival Antiochus VII Sidetes completed work in on a new castle and port, begun under Diodotus.

The Roman Republic fought Cilician pirates in , when Marcus Antonius the Orator established a proconsulship in nearby Side, and in under Servilius Vatia, who moved to control the Isaurian tribes. The period of piracy in Alanya finally ended after the city&#x27;s incorporation into the Pamphylia province by Pompey in , with the Battle of Korakesion fought in the city&#x27;s harbor. In Strabo&#x27;s reckoning, Coracesium marked the boundary between ancient Pamphylia and Cilicia (Cilicia Trachaea, in particular); though other ancient authors placed the boundary elsewhere. Isaurian banditry remained an issue under the Romans, and the tribes revolted in the fourth and fifth centuries AD, with the largest rebellion being from 404 to 408.

With the spread of Christianity Coracesium, as it was called, became a bishopric. Its bishop Theodulus took part in the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Matidianus in the Council of Ephesus in 431, Obrimus in the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Nicephorus (Nicetas) in the Third Council of Constantinople in 680. Coracesium was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Side, the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia Prima, to which Coracesium belonged. It continued to be mentioned in the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; as late as the 12th or 13th century. No longer a residential bishopric, Coracesium is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

Islam arrived in the 7th century with Arab raids, which led to the construction of new fortifications. The area fell from Byzantine control after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 to tribes of Seljuk Turks, only to be returned in 1120 by John II Komnenos.

Following the Fourth Crusade&#x27;s attack on the Byzantines, the Christian Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia periodically held the port, and it was from an Armenian, Kir Fard, that the Turks took lasting control in 1221 when the Anatolian Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I captured it, assigning the former ruler, whose daughter he married, to the governance of the city of Akşehir. Seljuk rule saw the golden age of the city, and it can be considered the winter capital of their empire. Building projects, including the twin citadel, city walls, arsenal, and Kızıl Kule, made it an important seaport for western Mediterranean trade, particularly with Ayyubid Egypt and the Italian city-states. Alaeddin Kayqubad I also constructed numerous gardens and pavilions outside the walls, and many of his works can still be found in the city. These were likely financed by his own treasury and by the local emirs, and constructed by the contractor Abu &#x27;Ali al-Kattani al-Halabi. Alaeddin Kayqubad I&#x27;s son, Sultan Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev II, continued the building campaign with a new cistern in 1240.

At the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243, the Mongol hordes broke the Seljuk hegemony in Anatolia. Alanya was then subject to a series of invasions from Anatolian beyliks. Lusignans from Cyprus briefly overturned the then ruling Hamidid dynasty in 1371. The Karamanids sold the city in 1427 for 5,000 gold coins to the Mamluks of Egypt for a period before General Gedik Ahmed Pasha in 1471 incorporated it into the growing Ottoman Empire. The city was made a capital of a local sanjak in the eyalet of Içel. The Ottomans extended their rule in 1477 when they brought the main shipping trade, lumber, then mostly done by Venetians, under the government monopoly. On September 6, 1608, the city rebuffed a naval attack by the Order of Saint Stephen from the Duchy of Florence.
Trade in the region was negatively impacted by the development of an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center. In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya&#x27;s port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the dilapidation of Alanya&#x27;s suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, as it is today. During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility, and civil construction continued under the local dynastic Karamanid authorities. Bandits again became common across Antalya Province in the mid-nineteenth century.

After World War I, Alanya was nominally partitioned in the 1917 Agreement of St.-Jean-de-Maurienne to Italy, before returning to the Turkish Republic in 1923 under the Treaty of Lausanne. Like others in this region, the city suffered heavily following the war and the population exchanges that heralded the Turkish Republic, when many of the city&#x27;s Christians resettled in Nea Ionia, outside Athens. The Ottoman census of 1893 listed the number of Greeks in the city at out of a total population of . Tourism in the region started among Turks who came to Alanya in the 1960s for the alleged healing properties of Damlataş Cave, and later the access provided by Antalya Airport in 1998 allowed the town to grow into an international resort. Strong population growth through the 1990s was a result of immigration to the city, and has driven a rapid modernization of the infrastructure.

==Geography==

Located on the Gulf of Antalya on the Anatolian coastal plain of Pamphylia, the town is situated between the Taurus Mountains to the north and the Mediterranean Sea, and is part of the Turkish Riviera, occupying roughly of coastline. From west to east, the Alanya district is bordered by the Manavgat district along the coast, the mountainous Gündoğmuş inland, Hadim and Taşkent in the Province of Konya, Sarıveliler in the Province of Karaman, and the coastal Gazipaşa district. Manavgat is home to the ancient cities of Side and Selge. East of the city, the Dim River flows from the mountains in Konya on a south-west route into the Mediterranean.

The Pamphylia plain between the sea and the mountains is an isolated example of an Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forest, which include Lebanon Cedar, evergreen scrub, fig trees, and black pine. The Alanya Massif refers to the area of metamorphic rocks east of Antalya. This formation is divided into three nappes from lowest to highest, the Mahmutlar, the Sugözü, and the Yumrudağ. The similar lithology extends beneath the city in a tectonic window. Bauxite, an aluminum ore, is common to the area north of city, and can be mined.
The town is divided east–west by a rocky peninsula, which is the distinctive feature of the city. The harbor, city center, and Keykubat Beach, named after the Sultan Kayqubad I, are on the east side of the peninsula. Damlataş Beach, named for the famous &quot;dripping caves&quot;, and Kleopatra Beach are to the west. The name &quot;Cleopatra&quot; possibly derives from either the Ptolemaic princess&#x27; visit here or the area&#x27;s inclusion in her dowry to Mark Antony. Atatürk Bulvarı, the main boulevard, runs parallel to the sea, and divides the southern, much more touristic side of Alanya from the northern, more indigenous side that extends north into the mountains. Çevre Yolu Caddesi, another major road, encircles the main town to the north.

===Climate===
Alanya has a typical hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), or a dry-summer humid subtropical climate (Trewartha: &quot;&#x27;wet&quot;&#x27; &quot;Cs/Cf&quot;). Located at the Mediterranean Basin, the subtropical high pressure zone ensures that most rain comes during the winter, leaving the summers long, hot, and dry, prompting the Alanya board of Tourism to use the slogan &quot;where the sun smiles&quot;.

Winters, however, are mild and wet. Storm cells sometimes bring with them fair weather waterspouts when close to the shore. The presence of the Taurus Mountain near to the sea causes fog, in turn creating visible rainbows many mornings. The height of the mountains creates an interesting effect as snow can often be seen on them even on warm days in the city below. The sea at Alanya has an average temperature of annually.

==Main sights==

On the peninsula stands Alanya Castle, a Seljuk era citadel dating from 1226. Most major landmarks in the city are found inside and around the castle. The current castle was built over existing fortifications and served the double purpose of a palace of local government and as a defensive structure in case of attack. In 2007, the city began renovating various sections of the castle area, including adapting a Byzantine church for use as a Christian community center. Inside the castle is the Süleymaniye mosque and caravanserai, built by Suleiman the Magnificent. The old city walls surround much of the eastern peninsula, and can be walked. Inside the walls are numerous historic villas, well preserved examples of the classical period of Ottoman architecture, most built in the early 19th century.

The Kızıl Kule (Red Tower) is a high brick building, standing at the harbor below the castle, and containing the municipal ethnographic museum. Sultan Kayqubad I brought the architect Ebu Ali from Aleppo, Syria to Alanya to design the building. The last of Alanya Castle&#x27;s , the octagonal structure specifically protected the Tersane (dockyard), it remains one of the finest examples of medieval military architecture. The Tersane, a medieval drydock built by the Seljuk Turks in 1221, is divided into five vaulted bays with equilateral pointed arches. The Alara Castle and caravanserai near Manavgat, also built under Kayqubad&#x27;s authority, has been converted into a museum and heritage center.

Atatürk&#x27;s House and Museum, from his short stay in the city on February 18, 1935, is preserved in its historic state and is an example of the interior of a traditional Ottoman villa, with artifacts from the 1930s. The house was built between 1880 and 1885 in the &quot;karniyarik&quot; (stuffed eggplant) style. Bright colors and red roofs are often mandated by neighborhood councils, and give the modern town a pastel glow. Housed in a 1967 Republican era building, The Alanya Museum is inland from Damlataş Beach.

Alanya is a member of the Norwich-based European Association of Historic Towns and Regions. In 2009, city officials filed to include Alanya Castle and Tersane as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and were named to the 2009 Tentative List.

==Demographics==
From only 87,080 in 1985, the district has surged to hold a population of 364,180 in 2022. This population surge is largely credited to immigration to the city as a result or byproduct of the increased prominence of the real estate sector and the growth of the housing market bubble. In 2007, the city itself had a population of 134,396, of which 9,789 are European expatriates, about half of them from Germany and Denmark. 17,850 total foreigners own property in Alanya. There are a lot of Iranians who have settled in the city. During the Persian New Year a lot of Iranians go to Alanya for vacation. The European expatriate population tends to be over fifty years old. During the summer the population increases due to large numbers of tourists, about each year pass through the city. Both Turks and Europeans, these vacationers provide income for much of the population.

The city is home to many migrants from the Southeastern Anatolia Region and the Black Sea region. In the first decade of the 21st century, the town has seen a surge in illegal foreign immigrants from the Middle East and South Asia, both to stay and to attempt to enter European Union countries. , claim residence in Alanya while working abroad. Yörük nomads also live in the Taurus Mountains north of the city on a seasonal basis. Additionally, there is a small African community descendant from imported Ottoman slaves. In 2018, it was estimated that around 300 Finns live permanently in Alanya and 3,000 during the Winter. According to the TÜİK Institute of Statistics, as of October 2022, 55,000 foreigners live in the city, more than half of them are Russian speakers.
The city is nearly 99% Muslim, and although many ancient churches can be found in the district, there are no weekly Christian services. In 2006, a German language Protestant church with seasonal service opened with much fanfare, after receiving permission to do so in 2003, a sign of the growing European population in the city. In 2015, the town began renovations of the Greek Orthodox Agios Georgios Church in the village of Hacı Mehmetli, and the church has been used for a monthly Russian Orthodox service. Alanya also provides the Atatürk Cultural Center to Christian groups on a regular basis for larger religious ceremonies.

==Education and health==
The city has 95% literacy, with public and private schools, and a roughly . Rural villages are, however, disadvantaged by the limited number of secondary schools outside the city center. Alantur Primary School, which opened in 1987, was built and is maintained under the Turkish &quot;Build Your Own School&quot; initiative, supported by the foundation of Ayhan Şahenk, the founder of Doğuş Holding.

In 2005, Akdeniz University of Antalya launched the Alanya Faculty of Business, as a satellite campus that focuses on the tourism industry. The school hosts an International Tourism Conference annually in coordination with Buckinghamshire New University. The city also has plans to open a private university in 2012. Georgetown University operates an annual study abroad program for American students known as the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies, named for the United States Ambassador to Turkey from 1952 to 1953 George C. McGhee, and based in his villa. Başkent University Medical and Research Center of Alanya, a teaching hospital run by Başkent University in Ankara is one of nineteen hospitals in Alanya. Other major hospitals include the 300-bed Alanya State Hospital and the 90-bed Private Hayat Hospital.

==Culture==

Alanya&#x27;s culture is a subculture of the larger Culture of Turkey. The city&#x27;s seaside position is central to many annual festivals. These include the Tourism and Arts Festival, which marks the opening of the tourism season from at the end of May or beginning of June. At the opposite end of the season, the Alanya International Culture and Art Festival is held in the last week of May, and is a notable Turkish festival. Other regular festivals include the Alanya Jazz Days, which has been held since 2002 in September or October at the Kızıl Kule, which is otherwise home to the municipal ethnographic museum. The Jazz Festival hosts Turkish and international jazz musicians in a series of five free concerts.

The Alanya Chamber Orchestra, formed of members of the Antalya State Opera and Ballet, gave its inaugural performance on December 7, 2007. The International Alanya Stone Sculpture Symposium, begun is 2004, is held over the month of November. The Alanya Documentary Festival was launched in 2001 by the Alanya Cinémathèque Society and the Association of Documentary Filmmakers in Turkey. Onat Kutlar, Turkish poet and writer, and founder of the Istanbul International Film Festival was born in Alanya, as was actress Sema Önür.

Atatürk&#x27;s visit to Alanya is also celebrated on its anniversary each February 18, centered on Atatürk&#x27;s House and Museum. The Alanya Museum is home to archaeology found in and around the city, including a large bronze Hercules statue, ceramics, and Roman limestone ossuaries, as well as historic copies of the Qur&#x27;an. European residents of Alanya also often celebrate their national holidays, such as Norwegian Constitution Day, and the city set up a Christmas market in December 2010. Iranians also celebrate the Persian New Year, Nevruz, in Alanya.

==Government==
Alanya was set up as a municipality in 1872, electing its first mayor in 1901. Today, Alanya is governed by a mayor and a municipality council made up of thirty-seven members. Twenty-four councilors are from the centre-left Republican People&#x27;s Party, nine are from the far-right Nationalist Movement Party, and four are of the Good Party. Mayor Osman Tarık Özçelik of the Republican People&#x27;s Party was elected in 2024 by unseating the incumbent Adem Murat Yücel, who had previously been mayor since 2014. Elections are held every five years, with the next to be held in March 2029.

Alanya District is divided up into , including the city center, and . Alanya is greatly influenced by the provincial government in Antalya, and the national government in Ankara, which appoints a governor for the district, currently Dr. Hulusi Doğan. Although Alanya has been part of Antalya Province since the Ottoman Empire, many local politicians have advocated a separate Alanya Province, a position supported by associations of foreign residents.

Nationally, in the 2007 election, the province voted with the Justice and Development Party, who were followed closely by the Republican People&#x27;s Party and the True Path Party. Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, of the Justice and Development Party, is the only native Alanyalilar Member of Parliament representing Antalya Province in the Grand National Assembly, where he chairs the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population. Çavuşoğlu is the current Turkish Foreign Minister and also served as the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
==Economy==
The tourist industry in Alanya is worth just under per year, and is therefore the principal industry. The area has many fruit farms, particularly lemons and oranges, and large harvests of tomatoes, bananas and cucumbers. About 80,000 tonnes of citrus fruits were produced in 2006 across . The greengage plum and the avocado are increasingly popular early season fruits where citrus fruits are becoming unprofitable.

Despite the seaside location, few residents make their living on the sea, and fishing is not a major industry. In the early 1970s, when fish stocks ran low, a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2007, locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores, which have opened branches in Alanya.

Beginning in 2003, with the provisional elimination of restrictions on land purchases by non-nationals, the housing industry in the city has become highly profitable with many new private homes and condominiums being built for European and Asian part-time residents. Sixty-nine percent of homes purchased by foreign nationals in the Antalya Province and 29.9% in all of Turkey are in Alanya. Buyers are primarily individuals, rather than investors. This housing boom put pressure on the city&#x27;s many gecekondu houses and establishments as property values rise and property sales to locals fall. A height restriction in the city limits most buildings to (). This keeps high rise hotels to the east and west of the city, preserving the central skyline at the expense of greater tourist potential. The fringes of the city however have seen uncontrolled expansion.

===Tourism===
Since the first modern motel was built in 1958, considered the first year of the tourist industry in Alanya, hotels have raced to accommodate the influx of tourists, and the city claims beds. Damlataş Cave, which originally sparked the arrival of outsiders because of the cave&#x27;s microclimate, with an average temperature of and , is accessible on the west side of the peninsula with trails from Damlataş Beach. Many tourists, especially Scandinavians, Germans, Russians, and Dutch, regularly vacation in Alanya during the warmer months. They are drawn to the area because of property prices, warm weather, sandy beaches, access to Antalya&#x27;s historic sites, and fine cuisine.

Other outdoor tourist activities include wind surfing, parasailing, and banana boating. Attractions include Europe&#x27;s largest waterpark, Sealanya, and Turkey&#x27;s largest go-kart track. Hunting season also attracts some tourist for wild goat, pig and partridge hunting in area nature reserves.

==Media==
Alanya has 10 local daily newspapers. One of these is &quot;Yeni Alanya&quot;, which includes the news and lifestyles magazine &quot;Orange&quot; and is available in English, German and Turkish. Two native German language newspapers are published in Alanya, the &quot;Aktuelle Türkei Rundschau&quot; and &quot;Alanya Bote&quot; for the community of German speaking residents and visitors. A monthly magazine &quot;Hello Alanya&quot; published in Alanya for foreigners, appearing in English and Dutch. The free regional newspaper, Riviera News, is printed in English and is widely available in Alanya.

Five radio stations broadcast from the city. Alanya FM Radyo broadcasts on 106.0 FM and is partnered with Radio Flash, on 94.0 FM, both broadcasting popular music. Other stations include Alanya RadyoTime on 92.3 FM, which broadcasts a variety of Turkish music, news, and talk programming. Two television stations are local to Alanya, Kanal Alanya, and Alanya Televizyonu, abbreviated ATV, which is partnered with Alanya RadyoTime.

==Transportation==
The D 400 Highway, the Alanya–Mersin Route, connects Alanya from the east and west, encircling it, and linking through the city center via Atatürk Bulvarı. The D695, the Ankara–Akşehir Route, runs north–south and reaches the sea west of the city near Side, connecting with the D400. Antalya Airport is away and connects internationally. The new Antalya Gazipaşa Airport, first begun in 1992, is only from the city, and was expected to have its first regular domestic flights on May 22, 2010, although international flights were not expected before the start of the 2011 tourist season. No train routes go to Alanya or Antalya Province, and there are no train stations in the district.

There are bus and dolmuş systems out of Alanya&#x27;s two bus depots, but buses are usually limited to the major roads, and inside the city transportation is by car, taxi, or foot, as many roads in the old town are closed to vehicle traffic. The harbor includes cruise ship piers, and also seasonal ferries and hydrofoils depart for Kyrenia in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Cruise ships docking at Alanya have increased 50% in 2013, with 53 estimated to have brought 56,000 passengers the end of the year. Further west of the city is the Alanya Marina, which started services in 2008 while still under construction, completing its expansion in 2010. The 85-km2 (33-sq-mi) marina allowed Alanya to participate in the 2008 Eastern Mediterranean Yacht Rally. The city is also investing in a community bicycle program with 150 bicycles and twenty terminals.

==Sports==

Alanya is home to a woman&#x27;s basketball team, Alanya Belediye, which started in the first division but was relegated after the 2002 season. The city hosts a Süper Lig soccer team, Alanyaspor. The club was founded in 1948, and play home games at Milli Egemenlik Stadium. It played in the Second League between 1988-1997 and 2014–2016. The club finally promoted to top level in 2015–16 season where they have played in to this day. In 2007, the city began constructing a new soccer facility with the intention of hosting winter competitions between major teams. The public Alanya Municipality Sports Facility is located adjacent to Milli Egemenlik Stadium, which is one of thirteen facilities.

Alanya&#x27;s waterfront location makes it suitable for certain events, and is perhaps most famous for its annual triathlon, part of the International Triathlon Union series, which has been held every October since 1990. Marathon swimming competitions have also been connected to the triathlon since 1992. Building on the triathlon&#x27;s success, Alanya hosted a modern pentathlon in 2009. Alanya is also the regular host of The Turkish Open, part of the Nestea European Beach Volleyball championship tour, which takes place in May. In 2007, the Turkish Volleyball Federation persuaded the European Volleyball Confederation to build a beach volleyball training facility in Alanya, and make it the exclusive &quot;center of beach volleyball in Europe&quot;.

The city is also a frequent host to national events, such as the annual beach handball tournament. Alanya is the traditional finish site of the seven-day Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, though organizers reversed the route in 2012, and started the event in Alanya instead. Other cycling events include the Alanya International Mountain Bike Race. Additionally, the European Cycling Union had its 2010 European road cycling championship and 2010 ordinary congress meeting in Alanya.

Recently the city also hosted 22nd Alanya International Culture, Art, and Tourism Festival, Alanya International Piano Competition and Festival and Europe Triathlon Cup Alanya all in 2024

<text>An Area of Darkness is a book written by V. S. Naipaul in 1964. It is a travelogue detailing Naipaul&#x27;s trip through India in the early sixties. It was the first of Naipaul&#x27;s acclaimed Indian trilogy that includes &quot;&quot; (1977) and &quot;&quot; (1990). The narration is anecdotal and descriptive.

Widely considered a passionate but pessimistic work, &quot;An Area of Darkness&quot; conveys the sense of disillusionment which the author experiences on his first visit to India in the sixties, marked with poverty and corruption. The book was banned in India for its &quot;negative portrayal of India and its people&quot;. The book is also considered Naipaul&#x27;s reckoning with his ancestral homeland and a sharp chronicle of his travels through India of the sixties encountering distressing poverty in the slums, corrupt government workers in the cities, to the ethereal beauty of the Himalayas, covering a vast canvas of the subcontinent.

According to some book reviewers, the title of the book, &quot;An Area of Darkness&quot;, was not so much a reference to India of the sixties, as to Naipaul&#x27;s feelings of distress and anxiety encountering poverty and suffering in India.

<text>Prince Barbu Alexandru Știrbey (; 4 November 1872 – 24 March 1946) was 30th Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Romania in 1927.

== Early life and ancestry ==
Born into the prestigious House of Știrbey, he was the son of Prince Alexandru Știrbey and his wife, Princess Maria Ghika-Comănești (1851–1885), and grandson of another Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei (born Bibescu, adopted Știrbei), who was Prince of Wallachia and died in 1869. The Știrbey family was one of the more prominent and wealthier &quot;boyar&quot; (noble) families in Wallachia, and had been so since the 15th century.

==Boyar==
Știrbey was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris, and was famous in Romania for his work in modernising the vast estates he owned, and &quot;his model farm was recognized for the exceptional quality of its products&quot;. Știrbey was a polished, cultivated aristocrat known in Romania as the &quot;White Prince&quot; on the account of his impeccable manners and the &quot;strange hypnotic quality&quot; of his eyes. In common with other members of Romania&#x27;s Francophile elite who wanted to emulate France, Romania&#x27;s &quot;big Latin sister&quot;, Știrbey spoke immaculate French and was always dressed in a dapper style that followed the latest fashions of Paris.

He married his second cousin, Princess Nadèje Bibescu in 1895, daughter of Prince Gheorge Bibescu and Marie Henriette Valentine de Caraman-Chimay, daughter of Prince Joseph de Riquet de Caraman-Chimay. They had five daughters: Maria, Nadejda, Elena, Eliza and Catharina. As a scion of one of the oldest &quot;boyar&quot; families of Wallachia while also being a descendant of the well known Bibescu &quot;boyar&quot; family, which had provided several &quot;voivodes&quot; and &quot;hospodars&quot; over the centuries, Știrbey had a somewhat patronising attitude towards the Romanian branch of the House of Hohenzollern. The Romanian Hohenzollerns were a Catholic Swabian cadet branch of the Prussian Protestant branch of the Hohenzollerns; Știrbey noted that his ancestors had been ruling Wallachia while the ancestors of King Carol I were mere petty Swabian nobility.

Știrbey was one of Romania&#x27;s richest men while also being one of its largest landowners. At Buftea, he owned 225 hectares of farmland and another 225 hectares of forestland; in the Olt County, he owned 325 hectares of farmland and another 2, 500 hectares of forestland; in Plugari, he owned 5, 200 hectares of farmland, and at Plopii-Slăvești, he owned 345 hectares of farmland. In addition, Știrbey sat on the board of directors of several of Romania&#x27;s largest corporations, insurance companies and banks such as the Franco-Romanian Railway Materials Company, the General Insurance Company of Bucharest, and the Steaua Română oil company. Amongst his lands included 200 hectares of vineyards. Reflecting his interest in the Romanian community of Transylvania, which at the time was part of the Austrian empire, Știrbey was member of the board of directors for the Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and the Culture of the Romanian People. Keenly interested in agrarian modernization, Știrbey founded an American style vine nursery at his Buftea estate, using the latest in Californian viticulture techniques to make his famous Știrbey wine. In a successful experiment, Știrbey was able to attach Romanian grapes to American rootstocks. He was the first to grow cotton and rice within Romania. Știrbey also set up on his Buftea estate a dairy farm, a mill and in 1902 founded a cotton factory. The &quot;White Prince&quot; was well known in Bucharest high society for the huge wine cellars under his house in Bucharest, from which he served the wines from his lands. 

The wines that Știrbey produced on his estate were well known in the 20th century, with the Orient Express carrying &#x27;Dining Car Stirbey&#x27; and &#x27;Muscat Ottonel Stirbey&#x27; wines. Baron Jakob Kripp, the husband of Știrbey&#x27;s granddaughter, Ileana Stirbey, stated: &quot;Barbu Stirbey carried on this legacy into the 20th century. He was an entrepreneur and very modern in his marketing, establishing a high-value brand for his wines. Putting the esteemed family name on the wine labels gave a guarantee of quality. He even hired a couple of young, creative Romanian artists to make a series of funny adverts for his wines.&quot; The British oenophilist Caroline Gilby described the Știrbey wines as becoming a very &quot;strong brand&quot; under the management of the &quot;White Prince&quot; who worked relentlessly from 1904 onward to promote his wines into becoming the best known wines of Romania.

The National Liberal politician Ion G. Duca described Știrbey: &quot;In a country of talkative people, I haven&#x27;t met a quieter man, in a society concerned with obtaining effect I haven&#x27;t seen a man displaying more modesty...Still, behind this banal appearance a tremendously interesting personality was hidden, with penetrating astuteness, exceptional ability and great ambition; a bizarre mixture of willfulness and laziness, decisiveness and fatalism, indifference and slyness. Brave, at times even daring, even though he preferred shadow to light, a lover of combinations, even though never practising plotting, Ştirbey was the type of the Romanian &quot;boyar&quot; who knew how to be flexible and sneak by&quot;. Princess Ann-Marie Callimachi described him: &quot;His manner was unassuming, but full of charm. He spoke little, but had a gift of persuasion and an instinctive psychological insight made him rarely miss his aim whenever he set himself one. Extraordinary was the way he always struck the right note&quot;. In 1907, Știrbey&#x27;s sister, Elisa Știrbey married Ion I. C. Brătianu, a rising politician in the National Liberal Party, forming an alliance between the Știrbey and Brătianu &quot;boyar&quot; families. Like her brother, Elisa was described as having a &quot;powerful personal magnetism&quot;, but unlike him with his love of secrecy and the indirect approach, her methods were blunt and direct.

==Relationship with Queen Marie==
His real significance in Romania history arises from his role as close confidant of Queen Marie, who was herself a highly influential figure in Romanian government circles prior to the accession of her son King Carol II, who had a God-complex, to the throne in 1930. The American historian Paul Quinlan described Marie as: &quot;...the classic fairy-tale princess. Highly intelligent, charming, outgoing, fluent in several languages, along with a gorgeous figure, golden hair, the bluest of eyes, and a beautiful face, the Crown Princess was considered one of the most beautiful women in the world.&quot; Marie was very charismatic and by the time she was 17 had already attracted several marriage proposals from various infatuated young men. Marie was on the verge of accepting a marriage proposal from Prince George (the future George V), the third in line to the succession in the British throne at the time, but her mother, who was desperate for her daughter to become a queen, hastily had her married off at the age of 17 to Crown Prince Ferdinand in 1892. Marie, who had a passionate and romantic personality, wrote in her diary shortly after marrying Ferdinand that he &quot;was not the man to awaken interest in a young girl&quot;.

Știrbey first met Marie in 1907, and spent time in her company. Marie liked Știrbey because as one contemporary remembered &quot;he treated her more like his equal&quot; and was &quot;never obsequious&quot;, behavior very much unlike most of the other &quot;boyars&quot; who wanted to ingratiate themselves with the royal family. To impress the British-born Marie, known to her friends as &quot;Missy&quot;, Știrbey started to dress in the style of an &quot;English gentleman&quot;. From 1907 onward, Marie frequently stayed at Știrbey&#x27;s estate at Buftea, where the two were often seen riding horses together out in the countryside, leading to rumors about them in Bucharest. Știrbey was the reputed father of the last of Marie&#x27;s children, Prince Mircea, and was quite possibly the father of Princess Ileana. It was often noted that Princess Ileana bore a marked resemblance to Știrbey, to such an extent that King Boris III of Bulgaria rejected her as a potential bride under the grounds that she was probably a Știrbey rather than a Hohenzollern.

Quinlan wrote: &quot;Marie had her own private suite at Buftea, Ştirbey&#x27;s estate, and he had his own apartment at both the Cotroceni and the royal palace in Bucharest. Their lengthy affair was so well known among the palace staff that Marie and Ştirbey hardly bothered to hide their feelings for each other within the confines of the royal palaces.&quot; Marie wrote in her 1935 memoirs &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; about the &quot;White Prince&quot;: &quot;No one had ever guessed what passions lay beneath his unbending pride&quot;. A secretive man, Știrbey preferred to stay out of the limelight, and to operate in the shadows, always pressing for someone else to carry out the policies he favored. When Știrbey&#x27;s brother-in-law, Brătianu, was prime minister, his sister Elisa saw herself as the first lady of Romania. Elisa Brătianu had a longstanding feud with Queen Marie, forcing Știrbey into the uncomfortable role of the peacemaker as he sought to mediate between his sister and his lover.

Though Știrbey&#x27;s title was only superintendent of the royal estates, which he held from 1913 onward, in charge of managing the vast estates owned by the House of Hohenzollern, he served as Marie&#x27;s principal adviser on Romanian politics and economics. The Romanian Crown Domain as the lands owned by the House of Hohenzollern were known were profitable under Știrbey&#x27;s management as he went about modernizing the agricultural and sylvicultural techniques on the farmlands and forestlands of the Crown Domain. The Crown Domain was divided into 11 districts, each one had a chief agronomist and a sylviculturist, who was reported directly to the superintendent of the Crown Domain based in Bucharest. Știrbey used his influence with Marie to favor the National Liberal Party as he was close to his brother-in-law Ion I. C. Brătianu, whose career benefitted greatly from his friendship. In opposition to King Carol I, Știrbey favored having Romania enter the First World War on the Allied side, seeing this as the best chance to gain Transylvania, a region of the Austrian empire with a Romanian majority, albeit with large Magyar and ethnic German minorities. &quot;

On 27 September 1914, King Carol I died, and his nephew Ferdinand came to the throne, Marie&#x27;s political influence increased as she dominated her husband. Marie once stated: &quot;it had been the throne&#x27;s salvation that I had taken the fiddle out of Ferdinand&#x27;s hands-a habit I could never break once I had tried it&quot;. Charles de Beaupoil, comte de Saint-Aulaire, the French minister in Bucharest noted: &quot;There is only man in Romania and that is the Queen&quot;. The half-British, half-Russian Marie tended to naturally favor the Allies. Marie was an outspoken champion of her &quot;beloved England&quot;, and the German legation in Bucharest called her &quot;the Entente in Bucharest&quot;.

On 27 August 1916, Romania entered the war on the Allied side and was promptly defeated, losing Wallachia, forcing the royal family to retreat into Moldavia to escape the advancing armies of Germany and the Austrian empire. During these travels, Știrbey was perpetually by Marie&#x27;s side, advising her to continue the war until the Allies won. The Romanian historian Mihai Ghițulescu noted in her diary that: &quot;&quot;Barbu came to tea&quot; is a leitmotif of the story&quot; as she mentions him in almost every entry of her wartime sections of her diary in 1916–1917. Știrbey encouraged Marie to strike her populist &quot;Mother of Romania&quot; persona as the Queen became very much the face of the government, constantly being seen to donate money to charities to assist the war-ravaged nation and to work as a nurse taking care of wounded soldiers. Though Marie always spoke Romanian with an English accent, she was very popular with the Romanian people, who saw her as their friend and champion. Fearful of the impact of the Russian Revolution, in 1917 Știrbey pressed Marie and through her, King Ferdinand to promise land reform. Though as a &quot;boyar&quot; land reform would hurt his own interests, the pragmatic conservative Știrbey felt that the only way to save the social order in Romania was to reform it. The text of the royal proclamation issued in the temporary wartime capital of Iași by King Ferdinand promising land reform after the war as a reward for the suffering of the Romanian people was written by Știrbey. Marie pressed Ferdinand very strongly to promise land reform and universal suffrage, which he agreed to despite his own fears of the implications of such promises. The oldest of Marie&#x27;s children, Crown Prince Carol (the future King Carol II) was well aware of his mother&#x27;s affair with Știrbey, which was a source of much tension as Carol utterly hated &quot;the White Prince&quot;.

At a reception at the Royal Palace in 1920 hosted by the queen, one visitor noted: &quot;She had a dress, a very long dress with a train in velvet with her magnificent pearls. She was in a corner of the throne room, and Barbu Știrbey was next to her, discussing something. They were not looking at each other, they were looking at the crowd. It was an extraordinary sight...They were such a magnificent pair. She was so beautiful and he was so handsome. They had such an extraordinary allure, grandeur and distinction...The best proof is that after more than fifty years I can still see them as if it happened last night&quot;. Știrbey&#x27;s relationship with Marie was an important factor in Romanian politics as he favored the National Liberal Party led Brătianu, and during the reign of King Ferdinand the Crown was notably in favor of the National Liberals. In turn, much of the hatred that Carol II was to display as a king towards the National Liberals stemmed ultimately from his hatred of Știrbey.

==National Liberal grandee==
The Crown Prince Carol greatly resented his mother&#x27;s relationship with Știrbey, and it was Știrbey who in the 1920s pressed the strongest to have Carol either renounce his relationship with his mistress Madame Lupescu or have Carol renounce the throne in favor of his son by Princess Helen of Greece, Prince Michael. Știrbey favored the National Liberal Party (which despite its name was the conservative party, representing the interests of the nobility and the industrialists) as the natural ruling party in Romania, not the least because the leader of the National Liberals, Brătianu, was his brother-in-law. Brătianu and the other National Liberal grandees in turn saw Crown Prince Carol as a &quot;loose cannon&quot;, who could not be manipulated like his father King Ferdinand had been, and believed that if Carol came to the throne, he would use the power of the monarchy to advance his own interests against their own.

The Romanian constitution gave the king fairly broad powers, and the tendency of the Crown to favor the National Liberals who usually won elections by rigging them was a key factor in keeping the National Liberals in power despite the party&#x27;s unpopularity. The National Liberals had a very clientistic style of ruling, engaging in patronage, graft and corruption, though the National Liberals did respect the wishes of the voters in the few elections that they proved unable to rig, handing over power after losing the 1928 election. Știrbey&#x27;s role in having Carol excluded from the succession in 1925 after he refused to give up Madame Lupescu caused Carol to have a grudge against both him and the National Liberals, whom he vowed to &quot;destroy&quot;. Under the guise of maintaining the social order, the National Liberals had passed laws which gave the police sweeping authoritarian powers and weakened civil rights; as the king had the power to name police prefects, such laws placed the king in a strong position to create a dictatorship if he so desired. The National Liberals had failed to provide for any constitutional checks on the powers of the monarchy, and instead used &quot;extra-constitutional&quot; checks such as Știrbey&#x27;s relationship with Queen Marie.

During a moment of political crisis caused by a dispute between the National Peasant Party vs. the National Liberals, Știrbey was appointed prime minister to head a &quot;national union&quot; government by King Ferdinand on 4 June 1927 when Brătianu proved unacceptable to the majority of the deputies. Știrbey stayed in office for only two weeks before he resigned in favor of his brother-in-law Brătianu. When King Ferdinand died on 20 July 1927, he was succeeded by his grandson who came to the throne as King Michael. The death of Ferdinand marked the end of Știrbey&#x27;s time as the &quot;grey eminence&quot; of Romanian politics as a regency council governed for the boy king Michael.

After Carol returned from his exile and became king in 1930 as Carol II, deposing his own son, King Michael, he started to use the vast powers of the monarchy to harass Știrbey in various ways. In 1934, Carol banished Știrbey from Romania, causing him to go into exile in Switzerland. In 1938, when Marie was dying, Carol refused permission to allow Știrbey to return, leading him to write her a letter in French saying: &quot;My thoughts are always near you. I am inconsolable at being so far, incapable of helping you, living in the memory of the past with no hope for the future...Never doubt the boundlessness of my devotion&quot;. In her reply, Marie wrote back to declare her sadness at &quot;so much unsaid, which would so lighten my heart to say: all my longing, all my sadness, all the dear memories which flood into my heart...The woods with the little yellow crocuses, the smell of the oaks when we rode through the same woods in early summer-and oh! so many, many things which are gone...God bless you and keep you safe&quot;. Știrbey was denied permission to attend Marie&#x27;s funeral.

When King Carol II established his royal dictatorship on 10 February 1938, almost every living former Romanian prime minister joined the cabinet of the new prime minister, Patriarch Miron Cristea of the Romanian Orthodox Church, which openly declared its intention to serve the king. Joining the cabinet were the former prime ministers Constantin Angelescu, Gheorghe Tătărescu, Artur Văitoianu, Gheorghe Mironescu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, Alexandru Averescu, and Nicolae Iorga. Știrbey was the only former prime minister vetoed by Carol II, and in turn Știrbey stated that he would not serve Carol even if he had been asked. The other former prime ministers who were asked to join were Octavian Goga and Iuliu Maniu, both of whom refused, albeit for very different reasons.

==World War Two==
In 1940, after the abdication of King Carol II, Știrbey returned to Romania. Știrbey&#x27;s son-in-law, Edwin Boxshall, was a British businessman long resident in Romania who married Elena &quot;Maddie&quot; Știrbey in 1920. In 1940, Boxshall left Bucharest and upon his return to London became an agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in charge of encouraging anti-Axis resistance in Romania. Through Boxshall, Știrbey was in contact with the SOE throughout World War Two. After the British legation in Bucharest was closed when the Antonescu government broke off diplomatic relations with Britain on 17 February 1941, the main SOE office for operations in Romania was moved to the British consulate in Istanbul. The main SOE contact between Istanbul and Bucharest was a wealthy Turkish arms dealer, Satvet Lutfi Tozan, who also served as the honorary Finnish consul in Istanbul. Tozan&#x27;s arms dealing business allowed him to travel all over the Balkans without creating suspicions. That Tozan was allowed to hold meetings with Romanian politicians such as Iuliu Maniu and Mihai Popovici at the house of Suphi Tanrɩöver, the Turkish ambassador in Bucharest, suggests that Tozan&#x27;s activities as a SOE agent had the approval of the Turkish government. During the war, Turkey under the leadership of President İsmet İnönü leaned in a pro-Allied neutrality and Tanrɩöver made it very clear that he was willing to serve as a middleman should Romania wish to sign an armistice with the Allies. Știrbey was close to his nephew Alexandru Cretzianu, who was a senior Romanian diplomat.

Știrbey disapproved of the genocidal politics of the government of General Ion Antonescu, which on 22 June 1941 joined with Germany in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion the Soviet Union. In the recovered regions of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina together with a part of the Soviet Union that was annexed to Romania that the Romanians called Transnistra, the Antonescu regime carried out genocide against the Jews living there, accusing them of having supported the Soviet Union. Știrbey donated money to assist the Jews in Transnistra as a police report from 1942 stated: &quot;As a result of our investigation, we have learned that Barbu Știrbey, owner of the Buftea lands, factories, and castle once sent 200,000 &quot;lei&quot; in cash to help poor Jewish deportees in Transnistra&quot;. On 6 October 1941, Cretzianu who served as the secretary-general of the Romanian foreign ministry, resigned in protest against the decision to annex Transnistria, and moved to Știrbey&#x27;s estate at Buftea, where he knew he would be safe from Antonescu&#x27;s policemen and gendarmes.

After exterminating the Jewish communities in Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and Transnistra, the Antonescu government opened up talks with Germany in 1942 to deport the Jews of the &quot;Regat&quot; (the area that belonged to Romania before World War I) to the death camps in Poland. Știrbey protested against these plans and against the anti-Semitic laws that had been passed since 1938. In a report issued by the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem, Știrbey was described as being one of the more proeminent Romanians &quot;active in condemning the racial discrimination and deportations&quot; under Antonescu. Throughout the war years, the &quot;White Prince&quot; was in correspondence with Wilhelm Filderman, the leader of the Romanian Jewish community, promising to use all of his influence to save the Jews of Romania from the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;. As Știrbey was close to Queen Marie, the grandmother of King Michael, who venerated her memory, he had much influence with the king. Ultimately, the king intervened with Antonescu to advise him that he disapproved of the plans to deport the Jews of the &quot;Regat&quot;, and the deportations were cancelled. In September 1943, Știrbey used his influence with the king to have Cretzianu appointed the Romanian minister to Turkey, where he let be known that he was willing to serve as a middleman for armistice talks with the Allies

On 22 December 1943, in Operation Autonomous, three SOE agents, Alfred Gardyne de Chastelain, Ivor Porter and Silviu Mețianu were parachuted into Romania. Though promptly captured by the Romanian gendarmerie, the three SOE agents were able to make contact with leading figures in the Antonescu government, warning him that to continue the alliance with Germany would result in disaster for Romania and offered the possibility of an armistice with Great Britain. On 11 January 1944, Știrbey met with the &quot;Conducător&quot; (&quot;Leader&quot;) as Antonescu had styled himself at the Snagov Villa; during the meeting, Antonescu told Știrbey that he knew that he disapproved of him and his regime, but asked him as a Romanian &quot;patriot&quot; to serve as a secret emissary for peace talks under the grounds that he had strong ties with Britain. On 1 February 1944, at a secret meeting in Ankara, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British ambassador to Turkey, told Alexandru Cretzianu, the Romanian minister to Turkey, that Știrbey would be welcome as an emissary for talks for an armistice in Egypt.

In response, in March 1944 Știrbey travelled via Turkey to Egypt where he opened up talks for an armistice with the Allies. Though Știrbey was supposed to be representing Antonescu in Cairo, before leaving Romania, he made contact with Iuliu Maniu of the National Peasant Party to discuss possible armistice terms that might be reached if Maniu was heading the government. Antonescu had become too closely identified with pro-German policies for the Allies to seriously consider signing an armistice with a government headed by him, and Maniu by contrast was the Romanian politician held in the best regard in London and Washington. In effect Știrbey was in the ambiguous position of representing both Antonescu and Maniu in Cairo. On 1 March 1944, Știrbey left Romania with the official story being he was going to Egypt to inspect a cotton factory he owned there. Unknown to Știrbey, Elyesa Bazna, the Albanian valet to Knatchbull-Hugessen, had gained access to the ambassador&#x27;s safe and was selling copies of the documents within the safe to the Germans. Bazna had hopes of becoming rich as a result of his espionage, but the Germans paid him with worthless counterfeit British pounds, causing him to die in poverty. As Knatchbull-Hugessen had orders to receive Știrbey when he arrived in Ankara, the Germans were well aware of Știrbey&#x27;s mission as Bazna had sold copies of the said orders. While crossing over the Bulgarian-Turkish border, the train was stopped by German officials who arrested one of Știrbey&#x27;s daughters, Elena, in the hope of ending his mission; Știrbey was too powerful in Romania to be arrested himself. Despite the arrest of his daughter who was a hostage, Știrbey chose to continue with his peace mission. To keep the &quot;swallow&quot; safe as Știrbey had been code-named from assassins during his trip, bodyguards from the British SOE together with the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) accompanied him.

Shortly after his arrival in Istanbul to take the train to Cairo, Știrbey&#x27;s trip was leaked to the Turkish press, making his mission more difficult. On 14 March 1944, Reuters published a story stating that &quot;a Romanian emissary, prince Știrbey, has left Istanbul to begin the negotiations in Cairo&quot;. Cretzianu was with his uncle when he was staying at the British consulate in Adana and reported that Știrbey was greatly surprised when turning on the radio to learn his secret mission was being reported on the news. On 27 March 1944, &quot;Time&quot; reported: &quot;Rich, suave, 70-year-old Prince Știrbey was the longtime lover of the late Queen Marie of Rumania, the mortal foe of her moody son, ex-King Carol, the presumed father of her youngest daughter, Ileana. Now the loyal aging go-between was embarked on one last attempt to save the trembling kingdom for his loved liege&#x27;s grandson, young King Mihai.&quot; The same report noted that the Gestapo had arrested Princess Elena as a British subject, but: &quot;...then inexplicably let her follow her father to Ankara&quot;.

In Ankara, diplomats at the British embassy gave Știrbey a false passport giving his name as a British businessman named Bond. At his first meeting in Cairo on 17 March 1944 with Allied diplomats, Știrbey declared that everyone in Romania from King Michael on downward were tired of the war and the alliance with Germany, and were looking for a chance to change sides. The three Allied diplomats Știrbey negotiated with in Egypt were Lord Moyne, the British resident minister for the Middle East (a sort of junior foreign minister); Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov, the Soviet ambassador to Egypt; and Lincoln MacVeagh, the American ambassador to the Greek government-in-exile based in Egypt. During the meetings in Cairo, Știrbey spoke in French, the language he was most comfortable in speaking after his native Romanian, which put Novikov, who spoke very poor French at a disadvantage. The same day that Știrbey started negotiations in Cairo, the Red Army reached the Dniester river, putting him in a weak bargaining position as it was very clear that the Soviets was about to take back Bessarabia and northern Bukovina regardless if Romania signed an armistice or not.

Știrbey stated that Antonescu knew the war was lost for the Axis side and if the Allies were unwilling to sign an armistice with a Romanian government headed by him, Maniu was willing to stage a coup in order to sign an armistice. Știrbey stated that the one non-negotiable condition for Romania to switch sides was that Allies had to promise that the northern part of Transylvania lost to Hungary under the Second Vienna Accord of 1940 be returned to Romania. Știrbey tried to press for Romania to retain Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, a condition that the Soviets rejected outright, saying there would be no armistice if the Romanians held out for that condition. The Soviet government took part in the meetings in Cairo and made it clear its skepticism about Știrbey&#x27;s offer, but British and American diplomats were more inclined to take up his offer. On 16 April 1944, Știrbey reported that the Allies were willing to offer the following armistice terms:
*&quot;Breaking with the Germans and after that Romanian troops to joint struggle with the Allied troops, including Red Army, against the Germans, in order to restore the independence and sovereignty of Romania.&quot;
*Restoring the &quot;Soviet-Romanian frontier of 1940&quot;, ceding Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union.
*Romania was to pay reparations to the Soviet Union for all of the damages done by Romanian troops inside the Soviet Union since 22 June 1941.
*Romania was to free all Allied POWs at once.
* Ensure that &quot;Soviet and Allied troops could move freely in Romania in any direction, if this is required by the military situation&quot; while Romania was to offer logistical support.
*In return, the Allies offered to cancel the &quot;unjust&quot; Second Vienna Accord of 1940 and return northern Transylvania to Romania, promising to expel all German and Hungarian forces from Transylvania.

In Bucharest, the Allied terms for an armistice were considered to be &quot;hard&quot; terms, and Antonescu wanted to reject them outright, saying he would rather fight on than sign an armistice that ceded Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. At a meeting at the Snagov Villa on 16 April 1944, Maniu wanted to accept the Allied terms, saying Știrbey had gotten the best terms that were possible given the current military situation, but Antonescu wanted to fight on, saying he believed if the Red Army could be stopped on the Dniester that Romania might get better armistice terms. On 7 May 1944, Antonescu argued at a cabinet meeting that he felt that the Royal Romanian Army together with the Wehrmacht were still capable of holding out on the Dniester, which led him to argue that Romania should continue the war until the Allies presented better armistice terms.
Upon his return to Bucharest, the elder statesman Știrbey advised King Michael that Romania would get better armistice terms if Antonescu was not prime minister. Știrbey was involved in the plans by King Michael to depose Antonescu and have Romania switch sides. Recognizing the Soviet Union would treat a post-Antonescu government better that included the Communists, Știrbey together with Maniu negotiated with Iosif Șraier, a Bucharest lawyer who was a member of the underground Romanian Communist Party, about how the Communists could have a member in the cabinet of the new government. It was agreed that Știrbey would return to Cairo to sign the armistice as soon as the king dismissed Antonescu. Shortly after the Royal coup of August 23, 1944, he traveled to Moscow with the Romanian delegation that signed on September 12 the Armistice Agreement between Romania and the Soviet Union. Știrbey was one of the plenipotentiary signatories of Agreement; the other signatories were Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, Dumitru Dămăceanu, and Ghiță Popp on the Romanian side, and Rodion Malinovsky on the Soviet side.

In February–March 1945, a political crisis erupted when the government of General Nicolae Rădescu was forced to resign. King Michael tried to name Știrbey as the new prime minister, but was prevented by the Soviet representative on the Allied Control Commission, Andrei Vyshinsky who insisted on Petru Groza as the new prime minister.

==Death==
Știrbey died on 24 March 1946 of liver cancer. He was buried at the Chapel in the Palace Park in Buftea together with his father and grandfather. His eldest daughter Nadèje inherited his lands, which were nationalised by the Communist government in 1949. In 1969, Știrbey&#x27;s granddaughter, Princess Ileana Stirbey, fled to France. In 1999, she and her husband, Baron Jakob Kripp, sued the Romanian government, arguing that the lands owned by the Știrbey family had been illegally nationalised. In 2001, she was awarded 20 hectares of land, and set about reviving the Știrbey wine that her grandfather had started selling in the early 20th century.

<text>SURAnet was a pioneer in scientific computer networks and one of the regional backbone computer networks that made up the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). Many later Internet communications standards and protocols were developed by SURAnet.
==How SURAnet started==
The Southeastern Universities Research Association was created in December 1980 by scientists and university administrators throughout the southeastern United States, primarily led by the University of Virginia, the College of William &amp; Mary, and the University of Maryland, College Park. The chief goal of SURA was the development of a particle accelerator for research in nuclear physics; this facility is now known as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. By the mid-1980s it was clear that access to high-capacity computer resources would be needed to facilitate collaboration among the SURA member institutions. A high-performance network to provide this access was essential, but no single institution could afford to develop such a system. SURA itself stepped up to the challenge and, with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and SURA universities, SURAnet was up and running in 1987, and was part of the first phase of National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) funding as the agency built a network to facilitate scientific collaboration. SURAnet was one of the first and one of the largest Internet providers in the United States. SURA sites first used a 56 kbit/s backbone in 1987 which was upgraded to 1.5M bit/s (DS1) in 1989, and to a 45 Mbit/s (DS3) backbone in 1991. FIX East and MAE-East, both major peering points, were located at the main SURA facilities. Large-scale collaboration among SURA-affiliated scientists became an everyday reality.

==Role of SURAnet in the development of the Internet==
SURAnet participated in the development of Internet communications standards and telecommunications protocols that enabled researchers and federal agencies to communicate and work in this early Internet environment. SURAnet was one of the first NSFNET regional networks to become operational. SURAnet provided networking services for universities and industry, and was one of the first TCP/IP networks to sell commercial connections, when IBM Research in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina was connected in 1987–1988. It was also the first network to attempt to convert to OSPF in 1990.

==Beyond SURAnet==
SURAnet was so successful that it outgrew SURA&#x27;s primary mission, and the SURA Board approved its sale to Bolt, Beranek and Newman in 1995. 
Many of the protocols and procedures created under SURAnet are still in use in the commercial Internet today. SURA continues to be a force in the information technology community, participating in projects such as the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), Earthcube, and AtlanticWave.

<text>Samuel Butler (4 December 1835 – 18 June 1902) was an English novelist and critic, best known for the satirical utopian novel &quot;Erewhon&quot; (1872) and the semi-autobiographical novel &quot; The Way of All Flesh&quot; (published posthumously in 1903 with substantial revisions and published in its original form in 1964 as &quot;Ernest Pontifex or The Way of All Flesh&quot;). Both novels have remained in print since their initial publication. In other studies he examined Christian orthodoxy, evolutionary thought, and Italian art, and made prose translations of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; that are still consulted.

== Early life ==
Butler was born on 4 December 1835 at the rectory in the village of Langar, Nottinghamshire. His father was Rev. Thomas Butler, son of Dr. Samuel Butler, then headmaster of Shrewsbury School and later Bishop of Lichfield. Dr. Butler was the son of a tradesman and descended from a line of yeomen, but his scholarly aptitude being recognised at a young age, he had been sent to Rugby and Cambridge, where he distinguished himself.

His only son, Thomas, wished to go into the Navy but succumbed to paternal pressure and entered the Anglican clergy, in which he led an undistinguished career, in contrast to his father&#x27;s. Samuel&#x27;s immediate family created for him an oppressive home environment (chronicled in &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;). Thomas Butler, states one critic, &quot;to make up for having been a servile son, became a bullying father.&quot;

Samuel Butler&#x27;s relations with his parents, especially with his father, were largely antagonistic. His education began at home and included frequent beatings, as was not uncommon at the time. Samuel wrote later that his parents were &quot;brutal and stupid by nature&quot;. He later recorded that his father &quot;never liked me, nor I him; from my earliest recollections I can call to mind no time when I did not fear him and dislike him... I have never passed a day without thinking of him many times over as the man who was sure to be against me.&quot; Under his parents&#x27; influence, he was set on course to follow his father into the priesthood.

He was sent to Shrewsbury at age twelve, where he did not enjoy the hard life under its headmaster Benjamin Hall Kennedy, whom he later drew as &quot;Dr. Skinner&quot; in &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;. Then, in 1854, he went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first in Classics in 1858. The graduate society of St John&#x27;s is named the Samuel Butler Room (SBR) in his honour.

== Career ==
After Cambridge, he went to live in a low-income parish in London 1858–1859 as preparation for his ordination into the Anglican clergy; there he discovered that infant baptism made no apparent difference to the morals and behaviour of his peers and began questioning his faith. This experience would later serve as inspiration for his work &quot;The Fair Haven&quot;. Correspondence with his father about the issue failed to set his mind at peace, instead inciting his father&#x27;s wrath. As a result, in September 1859, on the ship &quot;Roman Emperor&quot;, he emigrated to New Zealand.

Butler went there, like many early British settlers of materially privileged origins, to maximise distance between himself and his family. He wrote of his arrival and life as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station in &quot;A First Year in Canterbury Settlement&quot; (1863), and he made a handsome profit when he sold his farm, but his chief achievement during his time there consisted of drafts and source material for much of his masterpiece &quot;Erewhon&quot;.

&quot;Erewhon&quot; revealed Butler&#x27;s long interest in Darwin&#x27;s theories of biological evolution. In 1863, four years after Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, the editor of a New Zealand newspaper, &quot;The Press&quot;, published a letter captioned &quot;Darwin among the Machines&quot;, written by Butler, but signed &quot;Cellarius&quot;. It compares human evolution to machine evolution, prophesying that machines would eventually replace humans in the supremacy of the earth: &quot;In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race&quot;. The letter raises many of the themes now debated by proponents of the technological singularity, for example that computers evolve much faster than humans and that we are racing toward an unknowable future through explosive technological change.

Butler also spent time criticizing Darwin, partly because he (in the shadow of a previous Samuel Butler) believed that Darwin had not sufficiently acknowledged his grandfather Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s contribution to his theory.

Butler returned to England in 1864, settling in rooms in Clifford&#x27;s Inn (near Fleet Street), where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1872, the Utopian novel &quot;Erewhon&quot; appeared anonymously, causing some speculation as to who the author was. When Butler revealed himself, &quot;Erewhon&quot; made him a well-known figure, more because of this speculation than for its literary merits, which have been undisputed.

He was less successful when he lost money investing in a Canadian steamship company and in the Canada Tanning Extract Company, in which he and his friend Charles Pauli were made nominal directors. In 1874 Butler went to Canada, &quot;fighting fraud of every kind&quot; in an attempt to save the company, which collapsed, reducing his own capital to £2,000.

In 1839 his grandfather Dr. Butler had left Samuel property at Whitehall in Abbey Foregate, Shrewsbury, so long as he survived his own father and his aunt, Dr. Butler&#x27;s daughter Harriet Lloyd. While at Cambridge in 1857 he sold the Whitehall mansion and six acres to his cousin Thomas Bucknall Lloyd, but kept the remaining land surrounding the mansion. When in the 1870s his old Shrewsbury School proposed to relocate to a site at Whitehall, Butler publicly opposed it and the school ultimately moved elsewhere. His aunt died in 1880 and his father&#x27;s death in 1886 resolved his financial problems for the last 16 years of his own life. The land at Whitehall was sold for housing development; he laid out and named four roads – Bishop and Canon Streets after his grandfather&#x27;s and father&#x27;s clerical titles, Clifford Street after his London home, and Alfred Street in gratitude to his clerk. 

Butler indulged himself, holidaying in Italy every summer and while there, producing his works on the Italian landscape and art. His close interest in the art of the Sacri Monti is reflected in &quot;Alps and Sanctuaries of Piedmont and the Canton Ticino&quot; (1881) and &quot;Ex Voto&quot; (1888). He wrote a number of other books, including a less successful sequel, &quot;Erewhon Revisited&quot;. His semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, did not appear in print until after his death, as he considered its tone of satirical attack on Victorian morality too contentious at the time.

== Death ==

Butler died on 18 June 1902, aged 66, in a nursing home in St. John&#x27;s Wood Road, London. By his wish, he was cremated at Woking Crematorium and by differing accounts, his ashes were dispersed or buried in an unmarked grave.

&quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; was published after Butler&#x27;s death by his literary executor, R. A. Streatfeild, in 1903. This version, however, altered Butler&#x27;s text in many ways and cut important material. The manuscript was edited by Daniel F. Howard as &quot;Ernest Pontifex or The Way of All Flesh&quot; (Butler&#x27;s original title) and published for the first time in 1964.

== Sexuality ==

Butler&#x27;s sexuality has been the subject of academic speculation and debate. Butler never married, although for years he made regular visits to a woman, Lucie Dumas. Herbert Sussman, having arrived at the conclusion that Butler was homosexual, opined that Butler&#x27;s sexual association with Dumas was merely an outlet for his &quot;intense same-sex desire&quot;. Sussman&#x27;s theory calls Butler&#x27;s assumption of &quot;bachelorhood&quot; merely a means to retain middle-class respectability in the absence of matrimony; he observes that there is no evidence of Butler&#x27;s having any &quot;genital contact with other men&quot;, but alleges that the &quot;temptations of overstepping the line strained his close male relationships.&quot;

His first significant male friendship was with the young Charles Pauli, son of a German businessman in London, whom Butler met in New Zealand. They returned to England together in 1864 and took neighbouring apartments in Clifford&#x27;s Inn. Butler had made a large profit from the sale of his New Zealand farm and undertook to finance Pauli&#x27;s study of law by paying him a regular sum, which Butler continued to do long after the friendship had cooled, until Butler had spent all his savings. On Pauli&#x27;s death in 1892, Butler was shocked to learn that Pauli had benefited from similar arrangements with other men and had died wealthy, but without leaving Butler anything in his will.

After 1878, Butler became close friends with Henry Festing Jones, whom he persuaded to give up his job as a solicitor to be his personal literary assistant and travelling companion, at a salary of £200 a year. Although Jones kept his own lodgings at Barnard&#x27;s Inn, the two men saw each other daily until Butler&#x27;s death in 1902, collaborating on music and writing projects in the daytime, and attending concerts and theatres in the evenings; they also frequently toured Italy and other favorite parts of Europe together. After Butler&#x27;s death, Jones edited Butler&#x27;s notebooks for publication and published his own biography of him in 1919.

Another friendship was with Hans Rudolf Faesch, a Swiss student who stayed with Butler and Jones in London for two years, improving his English, before departing for Singapore. Both Butler and Jones wept when they saw him off at the railway station in early 1895, and Butler subsequently wrote an emotional poem, &quot;In Memoriam H. R. F.&quot;, instructing his literary agent to offer it for publication to several leading English magazines. However, once the Oscar Wilde trial began in the spring of that year, with revelations of homosexual behaviour among the literati, Butler feared being associated with the widely reported scandal and in a panic wrote to all the magazines, withdrawing his poem.

Some critics, beginning with Malcolm Muggeridge in &quot;The Earnest Atheist: A Study of Samuel Butler&quot; (1936), concluded that Butler was a sublimated or repressed homosexual and that his lifelong status as an &quot;incarnate bachelor&quot; was comparable to that of his writer contemporaries Walter Pater, Henry James, and E. M. Forster, also thought to be closeted homosexuals.

== Philosophy and personal thought ==

Whether in his satire or fiction, Butler&#x27;s studies on the evidence for Christianity, his works on evolutionary thought, or in his miscellaneous other writings, a consistent theme runs through, stemming largely from his personal struggle against the stifling of his own nature by his parents, which led him to seek more general principles of growth, development, and purpose: &quot;What concerned him was to establish his nature, his aspirations, and their fulfillment upon a philosophic basis, to identify them with the nature, the aspirations, the fulfillment of all humanity – and, more than that, with the fulfillment of the universe... His struggle became generalized, symbolic, tremendous.&quot;

The form that this search took was principally philosophical and – given the interests of the day – biological: &quot;Satirist, novelist, artist, and critic that he was, he was primarily a philosopher,&quot; and in particular, a philosopher who looked for biological foundations for his work: &quot;His biology was a bridge to a philosophy of life, which sought a scientific basis for religion, and endowed a naturalistically conceived universe with a soul.&quot; Indeed, &quot;philosophical writer&quot; was ultimately the self-description Butler chose as most fitting to his work.

=== Homer ===

Butler developed a theory that the &quot;Odyssey&quot; came from the pen of a young Sicilian woman, and that the scenes of the poem reflected the coast of Sicily (especially the territory of Trapani) and its nearby islands. He described his evidence for this in &quot;The Authoress of the Odyssey&quot; (1897) and in the introduction and footnotes to his prose translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (1900). Robert Graves elaborated on the hypothesis in his novel &quot;Homer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Butler argued in a lecture entitled &quot;The Humour of Homer&quot;, delivered at The Working Men&#x27;s College in London, 1892, that Homer&#x27;s deities in the &quot;Iliad&quot; are like humans, but &quot;without the virtue&quot;, and that he &quot;must have desired his listeners not to take them seriously.&quot; Butler translated the &quot;Iliad&quot; (1898). His other works include &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets Reconsidered&quot; (1899), a theory that the sonnets, if rearranged, tell a story about a homosexual affair.

=== Theology ===

In a book of essays published after his death, entitled &quot;God the Known and God the Unknown&quot;, Samuel Butler argued for the existence of a single, corporeal deity, declaring belief in an incorporeal deity to be essentially the same as atheism. He asserted that this &quot;body&quot; of God was, in fact, composed of the bodies of all living things on earth, a belief that may be classed as &quot;&quot;. He later changed his views, and decided that God was composed not only of all living things, but of all non-living things as well. He argued, however, that &quot;some vaster Person [may] loom ... out behind our God, and ... stand in relation to him as he to us. And behind this vaster and more unknown God there may be yet another, and another, and another.&quot;

=== Heredity ===

Butler argued that each organism was not, in fact, distinct from its parents. Instead, he asserted that each being was merely an extension of its parents at a later stage of evolution. &quot;Birth&quot;, he once quipped, &quot;has been made too much of.&quot;

=== Evolution ===

Butler wrote four books on evolution: &quot;Life and Habit&quot;; &quot;Evolution, Old and New&quot;; &quot;Unconscious Memory&quot;; and &quot;Luck, or Cunning, As the Main Means of Organic Modification?&quot;. Butler accepted evolution but rejected Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection. In his book &quot;Evolution, Old and New&quot; (1879), he accused Darwin of borrowing heavily from Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, while playing down these influences and giving them little credit. In 1912, the biologist Vernon Kellogg summed up Butler&#x27;s views:

Butler, though strongly anti-Darwinian (that is, anti-natural selection and anti-Charles Darwin) is not anti-evolutionist. He professes, indeed, to be very much of an evolutionist, and in particular one who has taken it upon his shoulders to reinstate Buffon and Erasmus Darwin, and, as a follower of these two, Lamarck, in their rightful place as the most believable explainers of the factors and method of evolution. His evolution belief is a sort of Butlerized Lamarckism, tracing back originally to Buffon and Erasmus Darwin.

Historian Peter J. Bowler has described Butler as a defender of neo-Lamarckian evolution. Bowler noted that &quot;Butler began to see in Lamarckism the prospect of retaining an indirect form of the design argument. Instead of creating from without, God might exist within the process of living development, represented by its innate creativity.&quot;

Butler&#x27;s writings on evolution were criticised by scientists. Critics have pointed out that Butler admitted to be writing entertainment rather than science, and his writings were not taken seriously by most professional biologists. Butler&#x27;s books were negatively reviewed in &quot;Nature&quot; by George Romanes and Alfred Russel Wallace. Romanes stated that Butler&#x27;s views on evolution had no basis in science.

Gregory Bateson often mentioned Butler and saw value in some of his ideas, calling him &quot;the ablest contemporary critic of Darwinian evolution&quot;. He noted Butler&#x27;s insight into the efficiencies of habit formation (patterns of behaviour and mental processes) in adapting to an environment:

[M]ind and pattern as the explanatory principles, which, above all, required investigation, were pushed out of biological thinking in the later evolutionary theories, which were developed in the mid-nineteenth century by Darwin, Huxley, etc. There were still some naughty boys, like Samuel Butler, who said that mind could not be ignored in this way – but they were weak voices, and, incidentally, they never looked at organisms. I don&#x27;t think Butler ever looked at anything except his own cat, but he still knew more about evolution than some of the more conventional thinkers.

=== Music ===

In &quot;Ernest Pontifex or The Way of All Flesh&quot;, protagonist Ernest Pontifex says that he had been trying all his life to like modern music but succeeded less and less as he grew older. On being asked when he considers modern music to have begun, he says, &quot;with Sebastian Bach&quot;. Butler liked only Handel, and in a letter to Miss Savage said, &quot;I only want Handel&#x27;s Oratorios. I would have said and things of that sort, but there are no &#x27;things of that sort&#x27; except Handel&#x27;s.&quot; With Henry Festing Jones, Butler composed choral works that Eric Blom characterised as &quot;imitation Handel&quot;, although with satirical texts. Two of the works they collaborated on were the cantatas &quot;Narcissus&quot; (private rehearsal 1886, published 1888), and &quot;Ulysses&quot; (published posthumously in 1904), both for solo voices, chorus, and orchestra. George Bernard Shaw wrote in a private letter that the music was invested with &quot;a ridiculously complete command of the Handelian manner and technique.&quot; Around 1871 Butler was engaged as music critic by &quot;The Drawing Room Gazette&quot;. From 1890 he took counterpoint lessons with W. S. Rockstro.

== Legacy and influence ==

Butler&#x27;s friend Henry Festing Jones wrote the authoritative biography: the two-volume &quot;Samuel Butler, Author of Erewhon (1835–1902): A Memoir&quot; (commonly known as Jones&#x27;s &quot;Memoir&quot;), published in 1919, and reissued by HardPress Publishing in 2013. Project Gutenberg hosts a shorter &quot;Sketch&quot; by Jones, first published in 1913 in &quot;The Humour of Homer and Other Essays&quot; and reissued in its own volume 1921 by Jonathan Cape as &quot;Samuel Butler: A Sketch&quot;. The most recent biography of Butler is Peter Raby&#x27;s &quot;Samuel Butler: A Biography&quot; (Hogarth Press, 1991; University of Iowa Press, 1991).

Butler belonged to no literary school and spawned no followers in his lifetime. He was a serious but amateur student of the subjects he undertook, especially religious orthodoxy and evolutionary thought, and his controversial assertions effectively shut him out from both the opposing factions of church and science that played such a large role in late Victorian cultural life: &quot;In those days one was either a religionist or a Darwinian, but he was neither.&quot;

His influence on literature, such as it was, came through &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, which Butler completed in the 1880s, but left unpublished to protect his family, yet the novel, &quot;begun in 1870 and not touched after 1885, was so modern when it was published in 1903, that it may be said to have started a new school&quot;, particularly for its use of psychoanalysis in fiction, which &quot;his treatment of Ernest Pontifex [the hero] foreshadows.&quot;

Sue Zemka writes that &quot;Among science fiction writers, &quot;The Book of the Machines&quot; has a canonical status, for it originates the conceit by which machines develop intelligent capacities and enslave mankind.&quot; For example, in Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; the &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; – &quot;in-universe ancient revolt against &#x27;thinking machines&#x27; that resulted in their prohibition&quot; – is named after Butler.

The English novelist Aldous Huxley acknowledged the influence of &quot;Erewhon&quot; on his novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Huxley&#x27;s Utopian counterpart to &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Island&quot;, also refers prominently to &quot;Erewhon&quot;. In &quot;From Dawn to Decadence&quot;, Jacques Barzun asks, &quot;Could a man do more to bewilder the public?&quot;

<doc id="937520" wikidata="Q17143441" url="?curid=937520" title="National Fantasy Fan Federation">
<text>The National Fantasy Fan Federation (N3F or NFFF) is one of the world&#x27;s oldest science fiction fandom organizations. The organization was founded in April 1941 when all science fiction, horror, and fantasy literature was lumped into one category called &quot;fantasy.&quot; The group actively encourages the development of writers, editors, and artists.

==History==
The group was founded by a loose cadre of members of Boston, Massachusetts-based Stranger Club who were inspired by the Damon Knight article &quot;Unite - or Fie!&quot; published in that month&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare&quot;. Knight said the withering of &quot;New Fandom&quot; should be counteracted by the creation of a general-purpose organization to link avid readers of all forms of speculative fiction. The club still exists today and continues to reach many of its members by regular mail, though it now has a growing online presence with its Web site and related mailing lists via the Internet.

==Organization and Services==
The N3F has a president, treasurer, secretary and directorate which handles the day-to-day operation of the club&#x27;s business. The president and directorate are elected by the membership.

The club&#x27;s activities revolve mainly around its bureaus, which are headed by club members who volunteer for the positions and are appointed by the president. Bureaus can consist of one to more than one person, depending on the level of participation by club members. Current bureaus include art, computer gaming, correspondence, welcommittee, Mangaverse, teaching SF, Future Fandom, Writer&#x27;s Exchange and an amateur press alliance.

Perhaps the heart of the N3F&#x27;s bureau activities are the round robins (RRs), which are conducted by both regular mail and e-mail. RRs, as they are called, are groups of members with interest in a specific topic (a particular writer, or a subject such as comics, cats in SF, dragons, horror, Star Trek, time travel, etc.). Each RR has a Robin Master, who starts the group with sending a letter or e-mail to one of the other members; that person adds their contribution and sends both items on to the next person in the group. Each time the packet returns to a member, they remove their previous contribution and insert a new one, often containing responses to what other RR members have written. This is one of the club&#x27;s oldest and longest-lasting activities, because it allows members to comment on topics of their interest without requiring them to travel or meet others in person.

<text>A station point is a location or vantage point from which an artist or exhibitor intends an observer to experience an artwork.
In photography, the station point is the location of the camera at the point in time when the camera records a view to a recording medium.

In traditional graphical perspective, oculus (abbreviated &quot;O&quot;) denotes the point in space where a viewer sees a scene to be portrayed on a picture plane. When depiction of a scene is taken over by a camera with photography, the &quot;eye point&quot; or oculus becomes the station point.

<text>Sanxingdui () is an archaeological site and a major Bronze Age culture in modern Guanghan, Sichuan, China. Largely discovered in 1986, following a preliminary finding in 1927, archaeologists excavated artifacts that radiocarbon dating placed in the 12th-11th centuries BC. The archaeological site is the type site for the Sanxingdui culture that produced these artifacts, archeologists have identified the locale with the ancient kingdom of Shu, which suggests the presence of a unique civilization in this region before the state of Qin conquered the area in 316 BCE. The artifacts are displayed in the Sanxingdui Museum located near the city of Guanghan.

Sanxingdui is on the UNESCO list of tentative World Heritage Sites, along with the Jinsha site and the tombs of boat-shaped coffins.

== Background ==

Many Chinese archaeologists have identified the Sanxingdui culture to be part of the ancient kingdom of Shu, linking the artifacts found at the site to its early and legendary kings. The kingdom is mentioned in &quot;Shiji&quot; and &quot;Shujing&quot; as an ally of the Zhou who defeated the Shang. Accounts of the legendary kings of Shu also may be found in local annals.

According to the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; that were compiled during the Jin dynasty (266–420), the Shu kingdom was founded by Cancong (). Cancong was described as having protruding eyes, a feature that is found in many of the masks and figures of Sanxingdui. It has therefore been suggested that the large masks with protruding eyes are a representation of Cancong, although there are other interpretations. Other eye-shaped objects were also found that might suggest worship of the eyes. Other rulers mentioned in &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; include Boguan (), Yufu (), and Duyu (). Many of the objects are fish- and bird-shaped, and these have been suggested to be totems of Boguan and Yufu (the name Yufu means fish cormorant), and the clan of Yufu has been suggested as the one most likely to be associated with Sanxingdui.

Later, similar discoveries were made at Jinsha as well, which is located 40 km away and has close link with the Sanxingdui culture. It is thought to be the relocated capital of the Shu Kingdom. It also has been suggested that the Jinsha site may be the hub and capital of the Duyu clan.

=== Archaeological site ===
The Sanxingdui archaeological site is located about 4 km northeast of Nanxing Township, Guanghan, Deyang, Sichuan Province. Archaeological digs at the site showed evidence of a walled city founded  1,600 BCE. The trapezoidal city has an east wall 2,000 m, south wall 2,000 m, west wall 1,600 m enclosing 3.6 km2, similar in scale to the inner city of the Zhengzhou Shang City.
The city was built on the banks of the Yazi River (), and enclosed part of its tributary, Mamu River, within the city walls. The city walls were 40 m at the base and 20 m at the top, varying in height from 8–10 m. There was a smaller set of inner walls.

The walls were surrounded by canals 25–20 m wide and 2–3 m deep. These canals were used for irrigation, inland navigation, defense, and flood control. The city was divided into residential, industrial, and religious districts organized around a dominant central axis. It is along this axis that most of the pit burials have been found on four terraces. The structures were timber-framed adobe rectangular halls. The largest was a meeting hall about .

=== Discovery ===
Evidence of an ancient culture in this region was first found in 1927 when a well-to-do farmer unearthed a large stash of jade relics while dredging an irrigation ditch, many of which through the years found their way into the hands of private collectors. In 1931, the discovery was brought to the attention of Vyvyan Donnithorne, an Anglican missionary stationed at the Gospel Church of Guanghan. He recognised the importance of the discovery and contacted a local magistrate as well as Daniel Sheets Dye, a professor of geology at West China Union University (WCUU). The three of them then visited the location and photographed and measured the site. Through the magistrate, a few items were acquired and sent to the museum at WCUU. Then, in 1934, David Crockett Graham, the new director of the museum at WCUU, organised the first archaeological excavation of the site.

In 1986, local workers accidentally found sacrificial pits containing thousands of gold, bronze, jade, and pottery artifacts that had been broken (perhaps ritually disfigured), burned, and carefully buried. Containing approximately 800 objects, the second sacrificial pit was found a little less than a month later, on August 14, 1986, only 20–30 meters from the first one.

Bronze objects found in the second sacrificial pit included sculptures of humans, animal-faced sculptures, bells, decorative animals such as dragons, snakes, chicks, and birds, and axes. Tables, masks, and belts were some of the objects found that were made out of gold, while objects made out of jade included axes, tablets, rings, knives, and tubes. There were also many ivory carvings, and clam shells. Researchers were astonished to find an artistic style that was completely unknown in the history of Chinese art.

Among the Sanxingdui discoveries, the bronze artifacts garnered exceptional scholarly attention. Task Rosen, chief archaeological expert from the British Museum, considered them to be more outstanding than the Terracotta Army in Xi&#x27;an. The first exhibits of Sanxingdui bronzes were held in Beijing (1987, 1990) and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne (1993).

Nevertheless, despite the interest in the excavated finds, the site suffered from flooding and pollution. For this reason the site was included in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. For the preservation of the site, funding was offered by American Express to construct a protective dike. Also, in 1997, the Sanxingdui Museum opened near the original site.
In March 2021, more than 500 cultural relics, including a 3,000-year-old gold mask, were discovered at Sanxingdui at a 4.6-square-mile area outside the provincial capital of Chengdu. The mask is estimated to be made from 84% gold and weighs 280 grams (0.6 pounds). According to the National Cultural Heritage Administration, the items were recovered from six newly discovered &quot;sacrificial pits&quot;. Additional masks, jade tools, and ivory relics were also discovered in the pit. The six pits were discovered at the Sanxingdui site between 2020 and 2022 during a renewed slate of excavations. The artifacts found in these excavations include fragments of a gold mask, traces of silk, bronze ware depicting animals, ivory carvings, and more. A round of excavations is scheduled to conclude in October 2022.

== Culture ==

The timeline of the culture of the Sanxingdui site is thought to be divided into several phases. The Sanxingdui culture that corresponds to periods II-III of the site, was a mysterious civilization in southern China. This culture is contemporaneous with the Shang dynasty, but it developed a different artistic style of bronze-making from the Shang. The first phase that corresponds to period I of the site belongs to the Baodun, and after the final phase (period IV) the culture was succeeded by the state of Ba and kingdom of Shu. Speculation regarding the end of the Sanxingdui culture includes that it might have been the result of natural disasters (evidence of massive flooding and an earthquake were found), or invasion by another culture.

The culture was governed by a strong central theocracy with trade links to bronze from Yin and ivory from South Asia.

=== Metallurgy ===
This ancient culture had a well developed bronze casting industry that permitted the manufacture of many impressive articles, such as the world&#x27;s oldest life-size standing human statue (260 cm high, 180 kg), and a bronze tree with birds, flowers, and ornaments (396 cm), which some have identified as renderings of the Fusang tree of Chinese mythology. The dawn redwood also may be found relatively near on the eastern fringe of the Sichuan Basin.
The most striking finds were dozens of large bronze masks and heads (at least six heads with gold foil masks originally attached) represented with angular human features, exaggerated almond-shaped eyes, some with protruding pupils, and large upper ears. Many Sanxingdui bronze faces had traces of paint smears: black on the disproportionately large eyes and eyebrows, and vermilion on the lips, nostrils, and ear holes. According to the French sinologist Corinne Debaine-Francfort, these colours provide evidence for ritual practices that were very different from those of the Shang dynasty. Vermilion is interpreted &quot;not be coloring but something ritually offered for the head to taste, smell, and hear (or something that gave it the power to breathe, hear, and speak)&quot;. Based upon the design of these heads, archaeologists believe they were mounted on wooden supports or totems, perhaps dressed in clothing. Liu Yang concludes &quot;masked ritual played a vital role in community life of the ancient Sanxingdui inhabitants&quot;, and he characterizes these bronze ritual masks as something that may have been worn by a &quot;shi&quot; () &quot;personator, impersonator; ceremonial representative of a dead relative&quot;.
The &quot;shi&quot; was generally a close, young relative who wore a costume (possibly including a mask) reproducing the features of the dead person. The &quot;shi&quot; was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good. 
Another scholar compares these &quot;bulging-eyed, big-eared, bronze heads and masks&quot; with &quot;eye-idols&quot; (effigies with large eyes and open mouths designed to induce hallucinations) in Julian Jaynes&#x27;s bicameral mentality hypothesis; and proposes, &quot;[i]t is possible that southern Chinese personators wore these hypnotic bronze masks, recursively representing the spirit of a dead ancestor with a mask that represents a face disguised by a mask&quot;.
Other bronze artifacts include birds with eagle-like bills, tigers, a large snake, zoomorphic masks, bells, and what appears to be a bronze spoked wheel but is more likely to be decoration from an ancient shield. Apart from bronze, Sanxingdui finds included jade artifacts consistent with earlier neolithic cultures in China, such as cong and zhang.

=== Cosmology ===
As far back as Neolithic times, East Asians identified the four quadrants of the sky with animals: Azure Dragon of the East, Vermilion Bird of the South, White Tiger of the West, and Black Tortoise of the North. Each of these Four Symbols (Chinese constellation) was associated with a constellation that was visible in the relevant season: the dragon in the spring, the bird in the summer, etc.

Since these four animals—birds, dragons, snakes, and tigers—predominate the finds at Sanxingdui, the bronzes might represent the universe. It is unclear whether they formed part of ritual events designed to communicate with the spirits of the universe (or ancestral spirits). As no written records remain it is difficult to determine the intended uses of objects found. Some believe that the continued prevalence of depictions of these animals, especially in the later Han period, was an attempt by humans to &quot;fit into&quot; their understanding of their world, their cosmology. (The jades that were found at Sanxingdui also seem to correlate with the six known types of ritual jades of ancient China, again each might be associated with a compass point (N, S, E, W) plus the heavens and earth.)

<doc id="937524" wikidata="Q5723837" url="?curid=937524" title="Henry James Byron">
<text>Henry James Byron (8 January 1835 – 11 April 1884) was a prolific English dramatist, as well as an editor, journalist, director, theatre manager, novelist and actor.

After an abortive start at a medical career, Byron struggled as a provincial actor and aspiring playwright in the 1850s. Returning to London and beginning to study for the bar, he finally found playwriting success in burlesques and other punny plays. In the 1860s, he became an editor of humorous magazines and a noted man-about-town, while continuing to build his playwriting reputation, notably as co-manager, with Marie Wilton, of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre. In 1869, he returned to the stage as an actor and, during the same period, wrote numerous successful plays, including the historic international success, &quot;Our Boys&quot;. In his last years, he grew frail from tuberculosis and died at the age of 49.

==Biography==
Byron was born in Manchester, England, the son of Henry Byron (1804–1884, second cousin to the poet Lord Byron and descendant of many Lords Byron), at one time British consul in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Elizabeth Josephine &quot;née&quot; Bradley. He was educated in Essex and then at St. Peter&#x27;s Collegiate School in Eaton Square, London. Although his mother wanted him to pursue a career in the Navy, Byron did not do so. Instead, he first became a physician&#x27;s clerk in London for four years and then studied medicine with his grandfather, Dr. James Byron Bradley, in Buxton. Byron married Martha Foulkes (1831–1876) in London in 1856. He entered the Middle Temple as a student briefly in 1858, but he had already begun writing for the stage and soon returned to that vocation.

===Early career===

Byron joined several provincial companies as an actor from 1853–57, sometimes in his own plays and sometimes in those of T. W. Robertson (with whom he acted and starved) or others, but had little success. He described his early attempts at acting, and the hardships of the journeyman touring actor, in an 1873 essay for &quot;The Era Almanack and Annual&quot; called &quot;Eighteen Parts a Week&quot;. He began writing burlesques of melodramas and extravaganzas in the mid-1850s. In 1857, his burlesque of &quot;Richard of the Lion Heart&quot; premièred at the Royal Strand Theatre. His successful works in 1858 included &quot;The Lady of Lyons, or, Twopenny Pride and Pennytence&quot; and &quot;Fra Diavolo Travestie; or, The Prince, the Pirate and the Pearl&quot;, also at the Strand, which later played in New York. This was so well received that Byron abandoned the law to concentrate full-time on theatre. Another successful Strand burlesque in 1858 was &quot;The Maid and the Magpie; or, The Fatal Spoon&quot; an early play to include a dance at the end of a song. This starred Marie Wilton as Pippo and was also revived in New York. In 1859, he wrote another successful burlesque, &quot;The Babes in the Wood and the Good Little Fairy Birds&quot;. He soon wrote other burlesques for the Strand, the Olympic Theatre, and the Adelphi Theatre, as well as a sequence of Christmas pantomimes for the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, beginning in 1859 with &quot;Jack the Giant Killer, or, Harlequin, King Arthur, and ye Knights of ye Round Table&quot; and followed the next year by &quot;Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday and the King of the Caribee Islands!&quot;

Byron also wrote for periodicals, and in 1861, he became the first editor of &quot;Fun&quot; magazine, where he showcased the comic talents of the then-unknown W. S. Gilbert. He became editor of &quot;Comic News&quot; in 1863. He also founded the short-lived &quot;Comic Trials&quot; and wrote a three-volume novel, &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, in 1865. In 1867, he became the editor of &quot;Wag&quot;, another humour magazine, and in 1877, the sixpenny magazine &quot;Mirth.&quot; He wrote numerous dramatic critiques and humorous essays for magazines, including the rival of &quot;Fun&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot;. During this period, he was a well-known man-about-town, joining, and popular as a guest at, various London dining clubs and, in 1863, becoming a founding member of the Arundel Club. Henry Morley acknowledged with dismay Byron&#x27;s position in the literary world as chief punster but found in him &quot;a true power of fun that makes itself felt by high and low&quot;. He became a Member of the Dramatic Authors&#x27; Society by 1860.

At the same time, he continued writing for the Strand, the Adelphi, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the Haymarket Theatre and the Princess&#x27;s, among other London theatres. Among Byron&#x27;s dozens of plays in the early 1860s, his early successes were mostly burlesques, such as &quot;Bluebeard from a New Point of Hue&quot; (1860); &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1860); &quot;Aladdin, or, The Wonderful Scamp&quot; (1861); and &quot;Esmeralda, or, The Sensation Goat&quot; (1861), all in rhymed couplets. Another success was &quot;George de Barnwell; or Harlequin Folly in the Realms of Fancy&quot; (1862). Several of these early plays were revived in Britain and received New York productions.
Between 1865 and 1867, he joined Marie Wilton, whom he had met through his early work at the Strand, in the management of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre. She provided the capital, and he was to write the plays. His first was a burlesque of &quot;La sonnambula&quot;. However, Wilton wanted to present more sophisticated pieces. She agreed to produce three more burlesques by Byron, but he agreed to write his first prose comedies, &quot;War to the Knife&quot; (a success in 1865) and &quot;A Hundred Thousand Pounds&quot; (1866). They also staged one of T. W. Robertson&#x27;s biggest successes, &quot;Society&quot;, in 1865. Upon his severing the partnership and starting theatre management on his own account in the provinces, he lost money, ending up in bankruptcy court in 1868. However, he produced many of his plays at these theatres while continuing to write for London theatres. One successful provincial work was &quot;Dearer than Life&quot; (1867), which received many revivals, beginning with a London revival in 1868 starring J. L. Toole and the young Henry Irving. Another, the same year, was &quot;The Lancashire Lass; or, Tempted, Tried and True&quot; (1867), a melodrama, also revived in London in 1868. He even collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on &quot;Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife&quot;, which played in 1867 at the Haymarket Theatre in London.

===Return to acting and later years===
He returned to acting, making his London acting début, in 1869, achieving much greater success than in his early attempts, as Sir Simon Simple in his comedy &quot;Not Such a Fool as He Looks&quot;. He followed this with successful outings as Fitzaltamont in &quot;The Prompter&#x27;s Box: A Story of the Footlights and the Fireside&quot; (1870), &quot;The Prompter&#x27;s Box&quot; (1870, revived in 1875 and often thereafter, and later renamed &quot;The Crushed Tragedian&quot;), Captain Craven in &quot;Daisy Farm&quot; (1871) and Lionel Leveret in &quot;Old Soldiers&quot; (1873). Byron&#x27;s acting was again admired in &quot;An American Lady&quot; in 1874, with which he began as the manager of the Criterion Theatre, and then &quot;Married in Haste&quot; (1875) which was much revived. In 1876, he played in his &quot;The Bull by the Horns&quot; and &quot;Old Chums&quot;. Other roles included Dick Simpson in &quot;Conscience Money&quot; (1878), Charles Chuckles in his &quot;An English Gentleman&quot; (1879) and John Blunt in his &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot; (1881). In 1881, he played the role of Cheviot Hill in a revival of his friend Gilbert&#x27;s eccentric comedy, &quot;Engaged&quot;. He continued acting until 1882, when ill health forced him to retire. Not surprisingly, Byron achieved his greatest acting successes in timing of the delivery of his own witty lines. &quot;The Times&quot; explained that &quot;in such parts as Gibson Greene in &quot;Married in Haste&quot;, a self-possessed, observant, satirical, well-bred man of the world, [Byron] was beyond the reach of rivalry. To ease and grace of manner he united a peculiar aptitude for the delivery of the good things he put into his own mouth.&quot;
Byron continued to write prose comedies with the ambitious semi-autobiographical &quot;Cyril&#x27;s Success&quot; (1868), &quot;The Upper Crust&quot; (starring Toole), &quot;Uncle Dick&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1870, starring Henry Irving), &quot;An English Gentleman&quot; (1871, starring Edward Sothern), &quot;Weak Woman&quot; (1875, starring Marion Terry), and his greatest success, &quot;Our Boys&quot; (1875–79, Vaudeville Theatre). With 1,362 performances in its original production, &quot;Our Boys&quot; set the record for the longest-running play in history and held it for almost two decades. It was also much revived, especially in America. 

From 1876 to 1879, he wrote several successful burlesques for the Gaiety Theatre, London, such as a burlesque of Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;Don Caesar de Bazan&quot; called &quot;Little Don Caesar de Bazan&quot;, and &quot;The Gaiety Gulliver&quot; (1879). Also during that period, he edited the humour magazine &quot;Mirth&quot;. In 1878, he co-wrote a highly successful charity pantomime, &quot;The Forty Thieves&quot;, together with Robert Reece, W. S. Gilbert and F. C. Burnand. In 1880, four volumes of his plays were published, with fourteen plays in each book. After 1880, as his health greatly declined, so did Byron&#x27;s playwriting output. The popular three-act comedy &quot;The Guv&#x27;nor&quot;, credited to &quot;E. G. Lankester&quot; and first performed in the 1880s, has been attributed to Byron on stylistic grounds.

Byron is described by Jim Davis in the introduction to his 1984 collection, &quot;Plays by H. J. Byron&quot;, as the most prolific playwright of the mid-Victorian period, as he produced over 150 dramatic pieces. &quot;The Times&quot; called Byron a master of &quot;genial wit and humour&quot;. It also commented that &quot;The secret of his success... lay chiefly in his dialogue, which is seldom otherwise than neat, pointed and amusing. He fires verbal shots in such rapid succession that one laugh has scarcely died away when another is raised. In the delineation of character, too, he is often extremely happy&quot;.

By 1874, he was showing symptoms of tuberculosis, which caused his retirement in 1882. His first wife died in 1876 at the age of 45, and the same year he remarried Eleanor Mary &quot;née&quot; Joy, the daughter of Edward Joy, a lawyer. His son Henry and daughter Crede (a pun on &quot;Crede Byron&quot;, the Byron family motto) also became actors, and he had another son.

During the last few years of his life Byron was in frail health, and he died at his home in Clapham, London, England, in 1884 at the age of 49. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

<text>Edward Caird (; 23 March 1835 – 1 November 1908) was a Scottish philosopher. He was a holder of LLD, DCL, and DLitt.

==Life==
The younger brother of the theologian John Caird, he was the son of engineer John Caird, the proprietor of Caird &amp; Company, born at Greenock in Renfrewshire, and educated at Greenock Academy and the Universities of Glasgow and Oxford (B.A. 1863). He was a Fellow and Tutor of Merton College from 1864 to 1866.

In 1866, he was appointed to the Chair of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow, which he held until 1893. In that year he became Master of Balliol College, from which he retired in 1907. In 1894 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Merton College.

He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1900.

In May 1902 he was at Carnavon to receive the honorary degree D.Litt. (Doctor of Letters) from the University of Wales during the ceremony to install the Prince of Wales (later King George V) as Chancellor of that university.

He was a founder member of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, alongside his wife, Caroline.

The philosopher John Watson was among his pupils at the University of Glasgow.

He died in Oxford on 1 November 1908 and was buried there in St Sepulchres Cemetery.

Caird was a Hegelian idealist and was an important contributor to the British idealist movement.

==Family==
He married Caroline Frances Wylie in 1867. They had no children.

<text>The Taimen is the most popular and common model of a Russian folding kayak. It was and still is a very common boat in its country of origin and has been exported to other nations around the world. The Taimen kayaks have been produced in a military factory in Moscow since 1975, even though the design changed only slightly. It is named after the taimen, a large species of trout found in Russia and Mongolia.

<doc id="937531" wikidata="Q212469" url="?curid=937531" title="Souvenir">
<text>A souvenir (French for &#x27;a remembrance or memory&#x27;), memento, keepsake, or token of remembrance is an object a person acquires for the memories the owner associates with it. A souvenir can be any object that can be collected or purchased and transported home by the traveler as a memento of a visit. The object itself may have intrinsic value, or be a symbol of experience. Without the owner&#x27;s input, the symbolic meaning is lost and cannot be articulated.

== As objects ==
The tourism industry designates tourism souvenirs as commemorative merchandise associated with a location, often including geographic information and usually produced in a manner that promotes souvenir collecting.

Throughout the world, the souvenir trade is an important part of the tourism industry serving a dual role, first to help improve the local economy, and second to allow visitors to take with them a memento of their visit, ultimately to encourage an opportunity for a return visit, or to promote the locale to other tourists as a form of word-of-mouth marketing. Promotional tchotchke at trade shows serve a similar function. Perhaps the most collected souvenirs by tourists are self-generated: photographs as a medium to document specific events and places for remembrance.

Souvenirs as objects include mass-produced merchandise such as clothing: T-shirts and hats; collectables: postcards, refrigerator magnets, key chains, pins, souvenir coins and tokens, miniature bells, models, figurines, statues; household items: spoons, mugs, bowls, plates, ashtrays, egg timers, fudge, notepads, coasters, and many others.

Souvenirs also include non-mass-produced items such as folk art, local artisan handicrafts, objects that represent the traditions and culture of the area, non-commercial, natural objects such as sand from a beach, and anything else that a person attaches nostalgic value to and collects among their personal belongings. The collecting of natural items such as seashells, plants, or rocks is often discouraged due to ecological damage. Especially the export of endangered plants and animals (or products made of their fur or leather) as souvenirs is strictly regulated by international laws.

A more grisly form of souvenir (here as an example of war booty) in the First World War was displayed by a Pathan soldier to an English Territorial. After carefully studying the Tommy&#x27;s acquisitions (a fragment of shell, a spike and badge from a German helmet), he produced a cord with the ears of enemy soldiers he claimed to have killed. He was keeping them to take back to India for his wife.

== As memorabilia ==
Similar to souvenirs, memorabilia (Latin for &#x27;memorable (things)&#x27;; plural of &quot;memorābile&quot;) are objects treasured for their memories or historical interest; however, unlike souvenirs, memorabilia can be valued for a connection to an event or a particular professional field, company or brand. Memorabilia can also be related to collections, such as action figures, or video games.

Examples include sporting events, historical events, culture, and entertainment. Such items include: clothing; game equipment; publicity photographs and posters; magic memorabilia; other entertainment-related merchandise &amp; memorabilia; movie memorabilia; airline and other transportation-related memorabilia; and pins, among others.

Often memorabilia items are kept in protective covers or display cases to safeguard and preserve their condition.

== As gifts ==

In Japan, souvenirs are known as , and are frequently selected from , or products associated with a particular region. Bringing back from trips to co-workers and families is a social obligation and can be considered a form of apology for the traveller&#x27;s absence. sales are big business at Japanese tourist sites. Unlike souvenirs, however, are frequently special food products, packaged into several small portions to be easily distributed to all the members of a family or a workplace.

Travelers may buy souvenirs as gifts for those who did not make the trip. A common tradition is to bring a thank-you gift for someone who provided a service such as pet sitting during the trip.

In the Philippines a similar tradition of bringing souvenirs as a gift to family members, friends, and coworkers is called .

<text>John Caird DD LLD (1820–1898) was a Scottish theologian. He entered the Church of Scotland, of which he became one of the most eloquent preachers. He served as the Principal of the University of Glasgow from 1873 until 1898.

== Life ==
He was born at 24 Nicholson Street in Greenock on 15 December 1820, the son of John Caird of Caird and Co. and Janet Young. His younger brother was Edward Caird.

He was educated at Greenock Grammar School, and then attended the University of Glasgow graduating MA in 1845. He spent some time as a missionary in Ardentinny before being licensed to preach as a Church of Scotland minister by the Presbytery of Glasgow in 1845.

In September 1845 he was ordained as minister at Newton-on-Ayr, translating to Lady Yester&#x27;s Church in Edinburgh in May 1847, and to Errol, Perthshire in July 1849. Caird was transferred to Park Church, Glasgow in 1857, being appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to Queen Victoria in the same year.

In 1862 he became Professor of Divinity at the University of Glasgow, and, in 1873 following the death of Thomas Barclay, became Principal of the university, a post which he then held for 26 years, until 1898.

The University of Glasgow made him a Doctor of Divinity in 1860 and St Andrews University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws in 1863. Edinburgh gave him a second DD doctorate in 1884.

A sermon on &quot;Religion in Common Life&quot;, preached before Queen Victoria, made him known throughout the Protestant world. He wrote &quot;An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion&quot; (1880), and &quot;Spinoza&quot; (1888).

Caird delivered the 1892–1896 Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, entitled &quot;The Fundamental Ideas of Christianity&quot;.

In 1897 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

He died on 30 July 1898 in Greenock and is buried in Greenock Cemetery. His position as Principal was filled by Robert Herbert Story.

==Family==

In June 1858 he married Isabella Riddle Glover, daughter of Rev Dr William Glover of Greenside. They had no children.

<text>The gravity anomaly at a location on the Earth&#x27;s surface is the difference between the observed value of gravity and the value predicted by a theoretical model. If the Earth were an ideal oblate spheroid of uniform density, then the gravity measured at every point on its surface would be given precisely by a simple algebraic expression. However, the Earth has a rugged surface and non-uniform composition, which distorts its gravitational field. The theoretical value of gravity can be corrected for altitude and the effects of nearby terrain, but it usually still differs slightly from the measured value. This gravity anomaly can reveal the presence of subsurface structures of unusual density. For example, a mass of dense ore below the surface will give a positive anomaly due to the increased gravitational attraction of the ore.

Different theoretical models will predict different values of gravity, and so a gravity anomaly is always specified with reference to a particular model. The Bouguer, free-air, and isostatic gravity anomalies are each based on different theoretical corrections to the value of gravity.

A gravity survey is conducted by measuring the gravity anomaly at many locations in a region of interest, using a portable instrument called a gravimeter. Careful analysis of the gravity data allows geologists to make inferences about the subsurface geology.

==Definition==
The gravity anomaly is the difference between the observed acceleration of an object in free fall (gravity) near a planet&#x27;s surface, and the corresponding value predicted by a model of the planet&#x27;s gravitational field. Typically the model is based on simplifying assumptions, such as that, under its self-gravitation and rotational motion, the planet assumes the figure of an ellipsoid of revolution. Gravity on the surface of this reference ellipsoid is then given by a simple formula which only contains the latitude. For Earth, the reference ellipsoid is the International Reference Ellipsoid, and the value of gravity predicted for points on the ellipsoid is the &quot;normal gravity&quot;, &quot;g&quot;n.

Gravity anomalies were first discovered in 1672, when the French astronomer Jean Richer established an observatory on the island of Cayenne. Richer was equipped with a highly precise pendulum clock which had been carefully calibrated at Paris before his departure. However, he found that the clock ran too slowly in Cayenne, compared with the apparent motion of the stars. Fifteen years later, Isaac Newton used his newly formulated universal theory of gravitation to explain the anomaly. Newton showed that the measured value of gravity was affected by the rotation of the Earth, which caused the Earth&#x27;s equator to bulge out slightly relative to its poles. Cayenne, being nearer the equator than Paris, would be both further from the center of Earth (reducing the Earth&#x27;s bulk gravitational attraction slightly) and subject to stronger centrifugal acceleration from the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Both these effects reduce the value of gravity, explaining why Richer&#x27;s pendulum clock, which depended on the value of gravity, ran too slowly. Correcting for these effects removed most of this anomaly.

To understand the nature of the gravity anomaly due to the subsurface, a number of corrections must be made to the measured gravity value. Different theoretical models will include different corrections to the value of gravity, and so a gravity anomaly is always specified with reference to a particular model. The Bouguer, free-air, and isostatic gravity anomalies are each based on different theoretical corrections to the value of gravity.

==The model field and corrections==

The starting point for the model field is the International Reference Ellipsoid, which gives the normal gravity &quot;g&quot;n for every point on the Earth&#x27;s idealized shape. Further refinements of the model field are usually expressed as corrections added to the measured gravity or (equivalently) subtracted from the normal gravity. At a minimum, these include the tidal correction △&quot;g&quot;tid, the terrain correction △&quot;g&quot;T, and the free air correction △&quot;g&quot;FA. Other corrections are added for various gravitational models. The difference between the corrected measured gravity and the normal gravity is the gravity anomaly.

===The normal gravity===
The normal gravity accounts for the bulk gravitation of the entire Earth, corrected for its idealized shape and rotation. It is given by the formula:
formula_1
where formula_2 = ; formula_3 = ; and formula_4 = . This is accurate to 0.1 mgal at any latitude formula_5. When greater precision is needed, a more elaborate formula gives the normal gravity with an accuracy of 0.0001 mgal.

===The tidal correction===
The Sun and Moon create time-dependent tidal forces that affect the measured value of gravity by about 0.3 mgal. Two-thirds of this is from the Moon. This effect is very well understood and can be calculated precisely for a given time and location using astrophysical data and formulas, to yield the tidal correction △&quot;g&quot;tid.

===The terrain correction===
The local topography of the land surface affects the gravity measurement. Both terrain higher than the measurement point and valleys lower than the measurement point reduce the measured value of gravity. This is taken into account by the terrain correction △&quot;g&quot;T. The terrain correction is calculated from knowledge of the local topography and estimates of the density of the rock making up the high ground. In effect, the terrain correction levels the terrain around the measurement point.

The terrain correction must be calculated for every point at which gravity is measured, taking into account every hill or valley whose difference in elevation from the measurement point is greater than about 5% of its distance from the measurement point. This is tedious and time-consuming but necessary for obtaining a meaningful gravity anomaly.

===The free-air correction===

The next correction is the free-air correction. This takes into account the fact that the measurement is usually at a different elevation than the reference ellipsoid at the measurement latitude and longitude. For a measurement point above the reference ellipsoid, this means that the gravitational attraction of the bulk mass of the earth is slightly reduced. The free-air correction is simply 0.3086 mgal m−1 times the elevation above the reference ellipsoid.

The remaining gravity anomaly at this point in the reduction is called the &quot;free-air anomaly&quot;. That is, the free-air anomaly is:
formula_6

===Bouguer plate correction===

The free-air anomaly does not take into account the layer of material (after terrain leveling) outside the reference ellipsoid. The gravitational attraction of this layer or plate is taken into account by the Bouguer plate correction, which is ρ &quot;h&quot; mgal m2 kg−1. The density of crustal rock, ρ, is usually taken to be 2670 kg m−3 so the Bouguer plate correction is usually taken as −0.1119 mgal m−1 &quot;h&quot;. Here &quot;h&quot; is the elevation above the reference ellipsoid.

The remaining gravity anomaly at this point in the reduction is called the &quot;Bouguer anomaly&quot;. That is, the Bouguer anomaly is:
formula_7

===Isostatic correction===

The Bouguer anomaly is positive over ocean basins and negative over high continental areas. This shows that the low elevation of ocean basins and high elevation of continents is compensated by the thickness of the crust at depth. The higher terrain is held up by the buoyancy of thicker crust &quot;floating&quot; on the mantle.

The isostatic anomaly is defined as the Bouger anomaly minus the gravity anomaly due to the subsurface compensation, and is a measure of the local departure from isostatic equilibrium, due to dynamic processes in the viscous mantle. At the center of a level plateau, it is approximately equal to the free air anomaly. The isostatic correction is dependent on the isostatic model used to calculate isostatic balance, and so is slightly different for the Airy-Heiskanen model (which assumes that the crust and mantle are uniform in density and isostatic balance is provided by changes in crust thickness), the Pratt-Hayford model (which assumes that the bottom of the crust is at the same depth everywhere and isostatic balance is provided by lateral changes in crust density), and the Vening Meinesz elastic plate model (which assumes the crust acts like an elastic sheet).

&quot;Forward modelling&quot; is the process of computing the detailed shape of the compensation required by a theoretical model and using this to correct the Bouguer anomaly to yield an isostatic anomaly.

==Causes==
Lateral variations in gravity anomalies are related to anomalous density distributions within the Earth. Local measurements of the gravity of Earth help us to understand the planet&#x27;s internal structure.

===Regional causes===

The Bouguer anomaly over continents is generally negative, especially over mountain ranges. For example, typical Bouguer anomalies in the Central Alps are −150 milligals. By contrast, the Bouguer anomaly is positive over oceans. These anomalies reflect the varying thickness of the Earth&#x27;s crust. The higher continental terrain is supported by thick, low-density crust that &quot;floats&quot; on the denser mantle, while the ocean basins are floored by much thinner oceanic crust. The free-air and isostatic anomalies are small near the centers of ocean basins or continental plateaus, showing that these are approximately in isostatic equilibrium. The gravitational attraction of the high terrain is balanced by the reduced gravitational attraction of its underlying low-density roots. This brings the free-air anomaly, which omits the correction terms for either, close to zero. The isostatic anomaly includes correction terms for both effects, which reduces it nearly to zero as well. The Bouguer anomaly includes only the negative correction for the high terrain and so is strongly negative.

More generally, the Airy isostatic anomaly is zero over regions where there is complete isostatic compensation. The free-air anomaly is also close to zero except near boundaries of crustal blocks. The Bouger anomaly is very negative over elevated terrain. The opposite is true for the theoretical case of terrain that is completely uncompensated: The Bouger anomaly is zero while the free-air and Airy isostatic anomalies are very positive.

The Bouger anomaly map of the Alps shows additional features besides the expected deep mountain roots. A positive anomaly is associated with the Ivrea body, a wedge of dense mantle rock caught up by an ancient continental collision. The low-density sediments of the Molasse basin produce a negative anomaly. Larger surveys across the region provide evidence of a relict subduction zone. Negative isostatic anomalies in Switzerland correlate with areas of active uplift, while positive anomalies are associated with subsidence.

Over mid-ocean ridges, the free-air anomalies are small and correlate with the ocean bottom topography. The ridge and its flanks appear to be fully isostatically compensated. There is a large Bouger positive, of over 350 mgal, beyond from the ridge axis, which drops to 200 over the axis. This is consistent with seismic data and suggests the presence of a low-density magma chamber under the ridge axis.

There are intense isostatic and free-air anomalies along island arcs. These are indications of strong dynamic effects in subduction zones. The free-air anomaly is around +70 mgal along the Andes coast, and this is attributed to the subducting dense slab. The trench itself is very negative, with values more negative than −250 mgal. This arises from the low-density ocean water and sediments filling the trench.

Gravity anomalies provide clues on other processes taking place deep in the lithosphere. For example, the formation and sinking of a lithospheric root may explain negative isostatic anomalies in eastern Tien Shan. The Hawaiian gravity anomaly appears to be fully compensated within the lithosphere, not within the underlying aesthenosphere, contradicting the explanation of the Hawaiian rise as a product of aesthenosphere flow associated with the underlying mantle plume. The rise may instead be a result of lithosphere thinning: The underlying aesthenosphere is less dense than the lithosphere and it rises to produce the swell. Subsequent cooling thickens the lithosphere again and subsidence takes place.

===Local anomalies===

Local anomalies are used in applied geophysics. For example, a local positive anomaly may indicate a body of metallic ores. Salt domes are typically expressed in gravity maps as lows, because salt has a low density compared to the rocks the dome intrudes.

At scales between entire mountain ranges and ore bodies, Bouguer anomalies may indicate rock types. For example, the northeast-southwest trending high across central New Jersey represents a graben of Triassic age largely filled with dense basalts.

The largest continental gravity gradient in the world is found across the Woodroffe Thrust-Mann Fault Zone in central Australia, and is attributed to an upthrust of dense mantle material 30 km closer to the present land surface, which occurred during the 630–520 Ma Petermann Orogeny.

<text>David Matthew Macfadyen (; born 17 October 1974) is an English actor. Known for his performances on stage and screen, he gained prominence for his role as Mr. Darcy in Joe Wright&#x27;s &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005). He gained wider recognition for playing Tom Wambsgans in the HBO drama series &quot;Succession&quot; (2018–2023), for which he received two Primetime Emmy Awards, two BAFTA TV Awards, and a Golden Globe Award.

Macfadyen made his television debut in 1998 as Hareton Earnshaw in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. He portrayed Tom Quinn in the BBC One spy series &quot;Spooks&quot; (2002–2004, 2011), and Inspector Edmund Reid in the BBC mystery series &quot;Ripper Street&quot; (2012–2016). For his role in &quot;Criminal Justice&quot; (2009), he received the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also starred in various miniseries playing roles such as Henry Wilcox in &quot;Howards End&quot; (2017), Charles Ingram in &quot;Quiz&quot; (2020), and John Stonehouse in &quot;Stonehouse&quot; (2023).

In film, Macfadyen is known for his roles in &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2007), &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; (2008), &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (2012), &quot;The Assistant&quot; (2019), and &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot; (2021). In 2024, he played Mr. Paradox in the superhero film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Macfadyen was born on 17 October 1974 in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the son of Meinir (née Owen), a drama teacher and former actress, and Martin Macfadyen, an oil engineer. His paternal grandparents were Scottish and his maternal grandparents were Welsh. Macfadyen was brought up in a number of places, including Jakarta, Indonesia, as a result of his father&#x27;s occupation. 

He attended schools in England, including in Louth, Lincolnshire, as well as in Scotland and Indonesia. He went to Oakham School in Rutland before being accepted to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) at 17. As a student, he was inspired by Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, which he thought was &quot;[a]n example to follow – an example of people acting with each other...&quot;, and &quot;[f]eatured just the most extraordinary acting I&#x27;d ever seen&quot;. He studied at RADA from 1992 to 1995.

==Career==
After leaving RADA, Macfadyen became known in British theatre primarily for his work with the stage company Cheek by Jowl, for which he played Antonio in &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, Charles Surface in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, and Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. His Benedick was played as an officer-class buffoon with a moustache and a braying laugh. In 2005, he played Prince Hal in &quot;Henry IV, Parts One&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; at the Royal National Theatre, with Michael Gambon in the role of Falstaff. In 2007, he returned to the stage, portraying an American, Clay, a stay-at-home father with a liberal attitude in the play &quot;The Pain and the Itch&quot;. A TV breakthrough came when he appeared as Hareton Earnshaw in an adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, screened on the ITV network in 1998. Further television drama work followed, including starring roles in the dramas &quot;Warriors&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; (2001), both for the BBC. Also in 2001, he earned acclaim for his starring role in the BBC Two drama serial &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, which was written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff. In 2002, he starred in &quot;The Project&quot;, a BBC drama charting New Labour&#x27;s rise to power.

He starred in &quot;Spooks&quot;, which became a success when screened on BBC One. A longer second season was screened in 2003, and a third season was broadcast in autumn 2004, with him leaving the series in the second episode. The series was aired as &quot;MI-5&quot; on the A&amp;E Network. In 2007 he appeared in the one-off Channel 4 drama &quot;Secret Life&quot;, which dealt with paedophilia. Macfadyen won the Best Actor award at the Royal Television Society 2007 Awards for this part, and was nominated for a BAFTA. He also appeared in a short sketch for Comic Relief as the bridegroom in &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, alongside Rowan Atkinson and Michelle Ryan. Macfadyen appeared in films including &quot;Enigma&quot; (released in 2001), and &quot;In My Father&#x27;s Den&quot;, for which he received the New Zealand Screen Award for Best Actor. He starred as the romantic lead Fitzwilliam Darcy in an adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, released in the UK in September 2005.
Macfadyen starred in Frank Oz&#x27;s &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; and the film &quot;Incendiary&quot;, based on Chris Cleave&#x27;s novel alongside Michelle Williams and Ewan McGregor. He also appeared in Ron Howard&#x27;s film &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;, in which he played John Birt. In 2008, he played the male lead Arthur Clennam in the BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;. In 2009 Macfadyen appeared alongside Academy Award-nominated actress Helena Bonham Carter in the BBC Four movie &quot;Enid&quot;, based on the life of Enid Blyton, as Hugh Pollock, Blyton&#x27;s publisher and first husband. In 2010, he played the Sheriff of Nottingham in &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. He starred as Prior Philip in the TV serial &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;, and was the middle-aged Logan Mountstuart in &quot;Any Human Heart&quot;. In June 2010, Macfadyen won a British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work in &quot;Criminal Justice&quot;. In 2011, Macfadyen made a final cameo in &quot;Spooks&quot;, and in 2012, he played Oblonsky in Joe Wright&#x27;s film &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. In December 2012 he began portraying Detective Inspector Edmund Reid in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Ripper Street&quot;.

In 2013–14, he played Jeeves in the production of &quot;Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in the West End of London. The play won the 2014 Olivier award for Best New Comedy. In 2015, Amazon Prime picked up &quot;Ripper Street&quot; and, after good reviews, it was recommissioned for fourth and fifth seasons. Macfadyen said he was &quot;delighted to be embarking on another dose of &quot;Ripper Street&quot;blood and guts, pocket watches and Victorian headgear, wonderfully dark, moving and mysterious story lines from Mr Richard Wardlow&quot;. The series also aired in the U.S. on BBC America. Also in 2015, he guest starred in the pilot episode of &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;. 

From 2018 to 2023, he starred as Tom Wambsgans in the HBO series &quot;Succession&quot;, for which he received Primetime Emmy Awards in 2022 and 2023 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in 2020, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role on Television in 2024. In 2020, he appeared in the role of Major Charles Ingram in a three-part ITV drama, &quot;Quiz&quot;, based on the controversial coughing cheat scandal on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in 2001. In 2024, Macfadyen played Mr. Paradox in the superhero film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Macfadyen began a relationship with his &quot;Spooks&quot; co-star Keeley Hawes. They were married in November 2004. The couple have two children. Macfadyen is stepfather to Hawes&#x27;s son from her previous marriage. In March 2024, it was reported that Macfadyen is a member of the Garrick Club.

<text>John Francis Campbell (Scottish Gaelic: Iain Frangan Caimbeul; Islay, 29 December 1821 – Cannes, 17 February 1885), also known as Young John of Islay (Scottish Gaelic: Iain Òg Ìle) was a Scottish author and scholar who specialised in Celtic studies, considered an authority on the subject.

== Early life ==
John Francis Campbell was born on Islay on 29 December 1821 to Lady Eleanor Charteris (1796–1832), eldest daughter of Francis Wemyss Charteris Douglas, and Walter Frederick Campbell of Islay (1798–1855), MP for Argyll. Campbell was a descendant (great-great-great-grandson) of Daniel Campbell of Shawfield who had bought Islay from the Campells of Cawdor, for £12,000 in 1726. His upbringing meant he was a fluent speaker of Gaelic.

Campbell was his father&#x27;s heir, but creditors forced the island of Islay into administration, and the family left in 1847. After his father&#x27;s death he was known as Campbell of Islay, even though the island had by then been sold.

== Education and early career ==
Campbell was educated at Eton and the University of Edinburgh.

He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple 1851, and appointed private secretary to George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, the Lord Privy Seal, in 1853. He was assistant secretary to the General Board of Health in 1854, he became secretary to the Trinity House Royal Commission of Lighthouses in London 1859. In 1861 he was Groom of the Privy Chamber.

== Celtic studies ==
Campbell was known as an authority on Celtic folklore and the culture of the Gaelic peoples. 

===Fieldwork and &quot;Popular Tales of the West Highlands&quot;===

His best-known published work is the bilingual &quot;Popular Tales of the West Highlands&quot; (4 vols., 1860–62). Its achievement has been compared by Richard Dorson to that of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;. 

Its origins lay in &quot;Popular Tales from the Norse&quot; (1859) by his friend George Webbe Dasent. Reading Dasent&#x27;s book, Campbell realised that he had heard Gaelic versions of some of the stories when young. He organised extensive fieldwork to collect Gaelic tales, and edited some of the resulting corpus for publication: a substantial part of the research remained unpublished at the time. He dedicated &quot;Popular Tales of the West Highlands&quot; to the Marquess of Lorne, son of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll. Among the recruits to Campbell&#x27;s collecting team was Alexander Carmichael. Campbell, with others, influenced the Irish folklorist Patrick Kennedy.

Campbell supported Francis James Child&#x27;s interest in collecting traditional ballads in a number of ways, from sending ballads collected through fieldwork to providing introductions.

===&quot;Leabhar na Feinne&quot;===
In 1872 Campbell self-published &quot;Leabhar na Feinne&quot;, a collection of heroic ballads culled from manuscripts held by libraries, but to his chagrin this endeavour failed to meet with success.

===&quot;The Celtic Dragon Myth&quot;===
&quot;The Celtic Dragon Myth&quot; was published posthumously in 1911. Campbell had started preliminary work on &quot;The Celtic Dragon Myth&quot; in 1862, and work intensified on it from 1870 until 1884. After Campbell&#x27;s death in 1885 the noted Gaelic scholar George Henderson contributed some translation work, provided an introduction, and completed the editing of the manuscript for its eventual publication in 1911.

===Other works===
*&quot;A Short American Tramp in the Fall of 1864&quot; (1865)
*&quot;Frost and Fire: Natural Engines, Tool-Marks and Chips&quot; (1865, 2 vols.)
*&quot;My Circular Notes: Extracts From Journals, Letters Sent Home, Geological and Other Notes, Written While Travelling Westwards Round the World, From July 6, 1874 to July 6, 1875&quot; (1876)
*&quot;Canntaireachd: Articulate Music&quot; (1880)
*&quot;Thermography&quot; (1883). Campbell held a lifelong interest in the sciences, especially geology and meteorology. He invented the meteorological sunshine recorder or thermograph that bears his name as the Campbell–Stokes recorder.

He edited for publication his late father&#x27;s work &quot;Life in Normandy, Sketches&quot; (1863).

== Travel ==

Campbell travelled extensively throughout the Scottish Highlands and Islands with his scribes, scrupulously recording West Highland tales, Fenian ballads, songs, charms and anecdotes.

He was proficient in Gaelic, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Lapp, Italian, Spanish and German. He travelled extensively, especially in Europe and Scandinavia. In 1874 he embarked on a year-long world tour that took him to America, Japan, China, Java, Ceylon and India.
Campbell was acquainted with Colin Alexander McVean, a Scottish engineer hired by Japan&#x27;s Public Works as chief surveyor, and visited sights around Tokyo with McVean at the end of 1874, including Nikko. During the observation of the Venus transit by the Meiji government on 9 December 1874, he superintended a theodolite on the Gotenyama Hill site in Tokyo. He travelled through the central part of Honshu to Kyoto, then left Japan from Kobe in February 1875. He bought Japanese antiques and showed them in London to friends including Frank Dillion.

== Later life ==
He is buried under a replica of Islay&#x27;s treasured Kildalton Cross in the Grand Jas Cemetery (le cimetière &quot;du Grand Jas&quot;) at Cannes.

Campbell never married.

<doc id="937577" wikidata="Q3504219" url="?curid=937577" title="Super Magnetic Neo">
<text>Super Magnetic Neo is a 3D platform game developed by Genki and released exclusively for the Dreamcast console. The game was originally released in Japan on February 3, 2000. The North American version was published by Crave Entertainment and was released on June 15, 2000, followed by the European release on August 4, 2000.

The game is centered around the concept of magnetism. The protagonist Neo (NiuNiu in the original Japanese release) is a robot who has the ability to positively or negatively charge himself in order to repel or attract enemies, or to repel from or attract to platforms and other environmental objects.

==Gameplay==
The game is a 3D platformer, with the usual jumps, platforms and enemies but features a novel game mechanic which centers around magnetism. Neo himself is able to become positively or negatively charged at the press of a button, which is represented on-screen as a blue or red magnetic field/pulse. The red and blue magnetic fields are mapped intuitively to the corresponding colored button on the Dreamcast controller. Neo&#x27;s magnetic fields interact with platforms, contraptions and enemies.

If Neo emits a red magnetic field near a red enemy, it is propelled into the distance based on the repelling nature of similarly charged magnets. Emitting a red magnetic field near a blue enemy will attract them, again based on the properties of magnets. When attracted, enemies will also be compressed to form a small magnetically charged box. These concepts work in the same way when Neo emits a blue magnetic field. Once boxed up, enemies become projectiles that can be used to defeat other enemies or to destroy roadblocks such as walls.

Neo&#x27;s magnetism can also be used to interact with platforms. For example, red platforms can used to perform super jumps when Neo emits a red magnetic field, effectively repelling him into the air, or alternatively he can &quot;stick&quot; to them by emitting a blue magnetic field. There are also zip lines that Neo can attach to by using the opposite colored magnetic field and levers that can be pushed by using the same colored magnetic field. These contraptions are strung together in series, requiring the player to constantly change the magnetic field to rapidly repel and attract their way through the level. The result is that the player can essentially &quot;fly&quot; through large sections without ever touching the ground.

Most of the game sees Neo travelling by foot with the usual running, jumping and pulling up on ledges. There are also levels featuring transport via a minecart, where similarly to &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, the player travels on rails and cannot choose their direction, but can jump to avoid enemies and obstacles. There are also ride sections, where Neo sits atop a robotic camel or horse, both of which accelerate forwards, requiring the player to move left and right and jump to avoid enemies and obstacles, much like the polar bear and tiger ride sections seen in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; video game series.

The main game spans four worlds: Jungle World, Ancient World, Cowboy World, and Future World. Each world has four levels and a boss level, thus the game consists of 20 levels in total. The levels are joined by a hub world and upon returning there after completing a level, the player has the option to save their progress. There is also a challenge mode, featuring 20 puzzle levels, each with five difficulties, providing 100 levels to complete.

In addition to challenge mode, there is also replay value in the form of collectables, objectives and the associated rewards. Each non-boss level has eight &quot;Pinki Coins&quot; to collect, a hidden item and a time trial/time attack where the player must complete the level in under a certain amount of time. Once the player achieves these three objectives on a level, they are rewarded with a piece of furniture for Neo&#x27;s home. There are 16 pieces of furniture to collect including a computer, a freezer and a famous art print.

In general, the gameplay and advancement is noted to be difficult and based on memorization of the location of enemies and contraptions, much like traditional platformers from previous generations.

==Plot==
The Pinki gang, consisting of the leader Pinki and her two henchmen Yasu and Gasu, have taken over Pao Pao amusement park. Pinki, an evil toddler, and her gang have filled the park with monsters, robots, and various magnetic contraptions. The amusement park is the professor&#x27;s favourite vacation destination, so he sends his magnetic robot Neo, who is an AI based on his own personality, to take back the park from the Pinki gang and restore it to its former glory.

Neo enters the park and utilises his powers of magnetism to traverse the various platforms, traps and contraptions and to defeat any enemies and bosses in his path. He fights through 4 differently themed areas of the amusement park after which he is able to track down and confront Pinki.

The final showdown with the Pinki gang sees Neo battle a giant mechanised ballerina robot. The Pinki gang are controlling the robot from the control centre in its head. When Neo defeats the ballerina, its body explodes and sends the head (still containing Pinki, Yasu and Gasu) flying into deep space.

== Development ==
&quot;Super Magnetic Neo&quot; was developed by Genki and was released for the Dreamcast on February 3, 2000. Once the direction of the game had been determined, it took 1 year to create with 18-20 staff members working on it. The magnetic mechanics of the game were pioneered primarily by Nobuyuki Nakano, who also designed the challenge and training modes.

The high difficulty of the game was an intentional decision by the team at Genki. They explained in an interview with Gamers&#x27; Republic magazine that &quot;staff members spent long hours working on game balance&quot;. They also added that they had strong feelings around not adding in any notes or signs that told the player what to do. They then go on to explain that the &quot;goal was to communicate, not through written words but through Neo&#x27;s body movements. As the result, &quot;SMN&quot; became a very challenging game&quot;.

The character design of Neo (NiuNiu) involved all members of the production team including programmers, producers and animators in addition to the designers. The main idea was to create a character that would &quot;physically embody magnetic characteristics&quot;. However, designer Shunsuke Kabasawa was responsible for Neo&#x27;s overall design.

Maintaining 60fps was a high priority throughout the creation of the game and took considerable development time to ensure that there were little to no frame rate drops.

The North American localization was published by Crave Entertainment and was released on June 15, 2000 and the European release was on August 4, 2000. To try to lessen the frustration over the difficulty of the game for the Western audience, Crave implemented power-ups that enabled Neo to take multiple hits before dying.

==Reception==
The game received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 29 out of 40.

The recurring view in reviews was that the game&#x27;s strengths were in its visuals and unique concept of magnetism, and its weaknesses were its heightened difficulty and sub-par controls. There were also frequent comparisons made to the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series due to the similar &quot;running into the screen&quot; viewpoint and animal rides.

Jason Weitzner of &quot;GameFan&quot; came to a similar conclusion as the eventual reviewers of the game and commented on the difficulty of the Japanese import, stating that &quot;This game&#x27;s tough&quot; and &quot;difficult enough to discourage its target audience.&quot; He went on to explain that changes would be needed for the US release especially the &quot;get hit once and die gameplay.&quot; As it turned out, this was something that was fixed with power-ups granting extra &quot;hits&quot; being added to the English language version. Anoop Gantayat of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the presentation, graphics, and sound, but criticized the gameplay&#x27;s &quot;silly definition of difficulty&quot;, &quot;slippery sense of control&quot; as well as its lasting appeal. He went on to explain that the biggest flaw of the game is level mastery due to the difficulty being based on &quot;trial and error deaths&quot; which can become frustrating to the player. Xavier Burn of &quot;GameSpot&quot; shared a lot of the same views as Gantayat, mentioning &quot;impressive presentation&quot; and criticizing the &quot;frustrating control issues&quot; in the Japanese import. Burn mentioned that the core concept of magnetism is &quot;interesting and easy enough to grasp&quot; and ultimately &quot;a solid and unique enough game to warrant a look&quot;. Dave Halverson of &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; described the same Japanese import as a &quot;hard-core old-school platformer&quot; and framed this difficulty in a positive light. Halverson was also positive about appearance, character design and sound, stating that &quot;every facet of the game...are tailored to perfection&quot;. His view on the controls conflicted with that of Burn and Gantayat, with Halverson describing them as &quot;pinpoint accurate controls&quot;. Francesca Reyes of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s addictive. But ultimately, it&#x27;s been done plenty of times before.&quot;

<text>Percy Braybrooke Molesworth (2 April 1867 in Colombo – 25 December 1908) was a Major in the corps of Royal Engineers and an amateur astronomer.

== Life and work ==
Molesworth was the youngest son of Sir Guildford Molesworth, and was educated at Winchester College. He obtained his commission in the Corps of Royal Engineers in 1886 and was stationed at Fort Camden until 1891. He then was ordered to Hong Kong and three years later moved to Trincomalee on Ceylon (now called Sri Lanka). He retired in 1906 intending to pursue astronomy full-time at his estate at Trincomalee, but he died of dysentery before he could realize his plans. He is buried in the St Stephen&#x27;s Cemetery in Docklands Road Trincomalee and the grave is two to the left of the memorial to the Royal Engineers. The inscription can be still seen clearly on the stone, as at Sept 19th 2013.

He was a founding member of the British Astronomical Association in 1890 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1898.

Molesworth was a talented observer creating first-class drawings of Mars and Jupiter in the years 1903 to 1905. He is credited with discovering a &quot;great disturbance&quot; in the southern bands of Jupiter on 28 February 1901. Known as the &quot;South Tropical Disturbance&quot; it lasted for close to forty years.

A crater on Mars was named in his honour.

The reflector telescope that he used was gifted to the University of Colombo many years after his death. It was used by Colombo University Observatory until 1988, when bandits looted the telescope&#x27;s metallic parts and sold them for scrap. It has not been used since, and can still be seen at the astronomy dome of the university at Reid Avenue, Colombo 7.

Ileana was born in Bucharest on 5 January 1909, the youngest daughter of Queen Marie of Romania and King Ferdinand I of Romania. Ileana had four older siblings: Carol, Elisabeth – later Queen of Greece, Princess Maria – later Queen of Yugoslavia, and Nicholas; and a younger brother Mircea.

Her mother wrote in her memoirs: 

==Girl Guiding==
Before her marriage, Ileana was the organizer and Chief of the Romanian Girl Guide Movement.

Later, Princess Ileana was involved in Guiding in Austria and served as president of the Austrian Girl Guides. From 1935 until Girl Guiding and Scouting were banned in 1938 after the Anschluss.

==Other achievements==
Ileana was the organizer of the Girl Reserves of the Red Cross, and of the first school of Social Work in Romania.

She was an avid sailor: she earned her navigator&#x27;s papers, and she owned and sailed the &quot;Isprava&quot; for many years.

==Before King Michael&#x27;s abdication==

===Marriage===
In 1919, Ileana and her sisters Elisabeta and Maria accompanied their mother to Paris at the Peace Conference. The sovereign hoped that during her stay there she could find suitable husbands for her two eldest daughters, especially Elisabeta, already aged twenty-five. After a few months in France, the Queen and her daughters decided to return to Romania in early 1920. On the way back, they made a brief stop in Switzerland, where they found the Greek royal family, who lived in exile since the deposition of King Constantine I during the Great War.

The king&#x27;s eldest son, Crown Prince and future King George II of Greece asked for Elisabeta&#x27;s hand in marriage. The Swiss visit also resulted in the engagement of Ileana&#x27;s eldest brother Crown Prince Carol to Princess Helen of Greece. Both couples married a year later.

In 1922, Queen Marie successfully arranged the marriage of her next daughter Maria to the King of Yugoslavia.

From then on Marie&#x27;s focus was on finding her last unmarried daughter a suitable partner. An engagement to the Crown Prince of Italy was reported, but denied by Marie, and rumors of a marriage to the Tsar of Bulgaria were debunked by its royal court. In 1930, Ileana was briefly engaged to Count Alexander of Hochberg. Queen Marie favored the match, being pleased by the English blood and wealth of Alexander&#x27;s family. The engagement was broken, however, when Alexander&#x27;s homosexuality came to light.

In Sinaia on 26 July 1931, Ileana married the Archduke Anton of Austria, Prince of Tuscany at Peles Castle, Sinaia. This marriage was encouraged by Ileana&#x27;s brother, King Carol II, who was jealous of Ileana&#x27;s popularity in Romania and wanted to get her out of the country. After the wedding, Carol claimed that the Romanian people would never tolerate a Habsburg living on Romanian soil, and on these grounds refused Ileana and Anton permission to live in Romania.

After her husband was conscripted into the Luftwaffe, Ileana established a hospital for wounded Romanian soldiers at their castle, Sonnburg, outside Vienna, Austria. She was assisted in this task by her friend Sheila Kaul. In 1944, she and the children moved back to Romania, where they lived at Bran Castle, near Brasov. Archduke Anton joined them but was placed under house arrest by the Red Army. Ileana established and worked in another hospital in Bran village, which she named &quot;The Hospital of the Queen&#x27;s Heart&quot; in memory of her beloved mother, Queen Marie of Romania.

==After exile==
After Michael I of Romania abdicated, Ileana and her family were exiled from the newly Communist Romania. They escaped by train to the Russian sector of Vienna, at that time divided into three sectors. After that they settled in Switzerland, then moved to Argentina and in 1950, she and the children moved to the United States, where she bought a house in Newton, Massachusetts.

The years from 1950 to 1961 were spent lecturing against communism, working with the Romanian Orthodox Church in the United States, writing two books: &quot;I Live Again&quot;, a memoir of her last years in Romania, and &quot;Hospital of the Queen&#x27;s Heart&quot;, describing the establishment and running of the hospital.

Ileana and Anton officially divorced on 29 May 1954. On 19 June 1954 in Newton, Massachusetts, she married Dr. Stefan Nikolas Issarescu. Her second marriage ended in divorce (without issue) in 1965.

In 1961, Ileana entered the Orthodox Monastery of Our Lady of All Protection/ Notre Dame de Toute Protection, in Bussy-en-Othe, France. On her tonsuring as a monastic, in 1967, Sister Ileana was given the name Mother Alexandra. She moved back to the United States and founded the &quot;Orthodox Monastery of the Transfiguration&quot; in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, the first English language Orthodox monastery in North America. She was the third female descendant of Queen Victoria to become a Mother Superior in a convent of her own foundation along with Princess Alice of Battenberg and Princess Elisabeth of Hesse. She served as abbess until her retirement in 1981, remaining at the monastery until her death.

She visited Romania again in 1990, at the age of 81, in the company of her daughter, Sandi.

On 3–5 January 1991, she suffered a broken hip in a fall on the evening before her eighty-second birthday, and while in hospital, suffered two major heart attacks. She died four days after the foundations had been laid for the expansion of the monastery. At the time of her death, Ileana was the last surviving child of King Ferdinand I of Romania and Queen Marie of Romania.

==Archives==
Princess Ileana&#x27;s personal papers (including family correspondence and photographs) are preserved in the &quot;Queen Marie of Romania Papers&quot; collection in the library of Kent State University (Kent, Ohio, US), and also in the &quot;Mother Alexandra Papers&quot; collection in the Hoover Institution Archives (Stanford, California, US). In addition, Ileana&#x27;s correspondence with the Romanian diplomat George I. Duca between 1924 and 1985 is preserved in the &quot;George I. Duca Papers&quot; collection in the Hoover Institution Archives (Stanford, California, US).

<doc id="937598" wikidata="Q1149189" url="?curid=937598" title="Rearrangement inequality">
<text>In mathematics, the rearrangement inequality states that for every choice of real numbers
formula_1
and every permutation formula_2 of the numbers formula_3 we have

Informally, this means that in these types of sums, the largest sum is achieved by pairing large formula_4 values with large formula_5 values, and the smallest sum is achieved by pairing small values with large values. This can be formalised in the case that the formula_6 are distinct, meaning that
formula_7 then: 
# The upper bound in () is attained only for permutations formula_2 that keep the order of formula_9 that is, formula_10 or equivalently formula_11 Such a formula_2 can permute the indices of formula_5-values that are equal; in the case formula_14 every permutation keeps the order of formula_15 If formula_16 then the only such formula_2 is the identity.
# Correspondingly, the lower bound in () is attained only for permutations formula_2 that reverse the order of formula_9 meaning that formula_20 If formula_16 then formula_22 for all formula_23 is the only permutation to do this.
Note that the rearrangement inequality () makes no assumptions on the signs of the real numbers, unlike inequalities such as the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality.

==Applications==

Many important inequalities can be proved by the rearrangement inequality, such as the arithmetic mean – geometric mean inequality, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, and Chebyshev&#x27;s sum inequality.

As a simple example, consider real numbers formula_24: By applying () with formula_25 for all formula_26 it follows that
formula_27
for every permutation formula_2 of formula_29

==Intuition==

The rearrangement inequality can be regarded as intuitive in the following way. Imagine there is a heap of $10 bills, a heap of $20 bills and one more heap of $100 bills. You are allowed to take 7 bills from a heap of your choice and then the heap disappears. In the second round you are allowed to take 5 bills from another heap and the heap disappears. In the last round you may take 3 bills from the last heap. In what order do you want to choose the heaps to maximize your profit? Obviously, the best you can do is to gain formula_30 dollars. This is exactly what the upper bound of the rearrangement inequality () says for the sequences formula_31 and formula_32 In this sense, it can be considered as an example of a greedy algorithm.

==Geometric interpretation==

Assume that formula_33 and formula_34 Consider a rectangle of width formula_35 and height formula_36 subdivided into formula_37 columns of widths formula_38 and the same number of rows of heights formula_39 so there are formula_40 small rectangles. You are supposed to take formula_37 of these, one from each column and one from each row. The rearrangement inequality () says that you optimize the total area of your selection by taking the rectangles on the diagonal or the antidiagonal. 

==Proofs==

===Proof by contradiction===

The lower bound and the corresponding discussion of equality follow by applying the results for the upper bound to
formula_42, that is, let formula_43 be any permutation of the numbers formula_44 we have formula_45. Then, formula_46 for every permutation formula_43 of formula_48.

Therefore, it suffices to prove the upper bound in () and discuss when equality holds. 
Since there are only finitely many permutations of formula_49 there exists at least one formula_2 for which the middle term in ()
formula_51
is maximal. In case there are several permutations with this property, let σ denote one with the highest number of integers formula_52 from formula_53 satisfying formula_54

We will now prove by contradiction, that formula_2 has to keep the order of formula_56 (then we are done with the upper bound in (), because the identity has that property). Assume that there exists a formula_57 such that formula_58 for all formula_59 and formula_60 Hence formula_61 and there has to exist a formula_62 with formula_63 to fill the gap. Therefore,

which implies that

Expanding this product and rearranging gives

which is equivalent to (). Hence the permutation
formula_64
which arises from formula_2 by exchanging the values formula_66 and formula_67 has at least one additional point which keeps the order compared to formula_68 namely at formula_69 satisfying formula_70 and also attains the maximum in () due to (). This contradicts the choice of formula_71

If formula_7 then we have strict inequalities in (), (), and (), hence the maximum can only be attained by permutations keeping the order of formula_73 and every other permutation formula_2 cannot be optimal.

===Proof by induction===

As above, it suffices to treat the upper bound in (). For a proof by mathematical induction, we start with formula_75 Observe that 
formula_76
implies that

which is equivalent to

hence the upper bound in () is true for formula_77
If formula_78 then we get strict inequality in () and () if and only if formula_79 Hence only the identity, which is the only permutation here keeping the order of formula_80 gives the maximum.

As an induction hypothesis assume that the upper bound in the rearrangement inequality () is true for formula_81 with formula_82 and that in the case formula_83 there is equality only when the permutation formula_2 of formula_85 keeps the order of formula_86

Consider now formula_24 and formula_88 Take a formula_2 from the finite number of permutations of formula_90 such that the rearrangement in the middle of () gives the maximal result. There are two cases:

* If formula_91 then formula_92 and, using the induction hypothesis, the upper bound in () is true with equality and formula_2 keeps the order of formula_94 in the case formula_95
* If formula_96 then there is a formula_97 with formula_98 Define the permutation formula_99 which arises from formula_2 by exchanging the values of formula_69 and formula_102 There are now two subcases:
# If formula_103 or formula_104 then this exchange of values of formula_2 has no effect on the middle term in () because formula_106 gives the same sum, and we can proceed by applying the first case to formula_107 Note that in the case formula_7 the permutation formula_106 keeps the order of formula_56 if and only if formula_2 does.
# If formula_112 and formula_113 then formula_114 which is equivalent to formula_115 and shows that formula_2 is not optimal, hence this case cannot happen due to the choice of formula_71

==Generalizations==

===Three or more sequences===
A straightforward generalization takes into account more sequences. Assume we have finite ordered sequences of nonnegative real numbers
formula_118
and a permutation formula_119 of formula_120 and another permutation formula_121 of formula_122 Then
formula_123

Note that, unlike the standard rearrangement inequality (), this statement requires the numbers to be nonnegative. A similar statement is true for any number of sequences with all numbers nonnegative.

===Functions instead of factors===
Another generalization of the rearrangement inequality states that for all real numbers formula_24 and every choice of continuously differentiable functions formula_125 for formula_126 such that their derivatives formula_127 satisfy
formula_128
the inequality
formula_129
holds for every permutation formula_130 of formula_131
Taking real numbers formula_132 and the linear functions formula_133 for real formula_4 and formula_26 the standard rearrangement inequality () is recovered.

<text>Hulme Grammar School is a private grammar school in Oldham, Greater Manchester, England.

==History==
Oldham Hulme Grammar School was founded in 1611 by several charitable individuals including Laurence Chadeton, but closed in 1866 and was refounded, under the Endowed Schools Act 1869 (hence the claim to be a continuation of this earlier school is debated). The doorway of the original Oldham Hulme Grammar School building with its date stone and a window were incorporated into the current school building in the 1920s. When the school was refounded in 1887 it obtained some money from a charitable trust created in 1691 by a bequest from William Hulme, after whom the new school was named. The main buildings, incorporating were erected in 1895 by the Hulme Trust. The first headmaster of the new era was Samuel Ogden Andrew, who later achieved acclaim as a translator of Homer.

<text>STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT; originally Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) through Network Address Translators) is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, for traversal of network address translator (NAT) gateways in applications of real-time voice, video, messaging, and other interactive communications.

STUN is a tool used by other protocols, such as Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and WebRTC. It provides a tool for hosts to discover the presence of a network address translator, and to discover the mapped, usually public, Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application&#x27;s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. The protocol requires assistance from a third-party network server (STUN server) located on the opposing (public) side of the NAT, usually the public Internet.

STUN was first announced in RFC 3489; the title was changed in a specification of an updated set of methods published as RFC 5389, retaining the same acronym.

== History ==
STUN was first announced in RFC 3489. The original specification specified an algorithm to characterize NAT behavior according to the address and port mapping behavior. This algorithm is not reliably successful and only applicable to a subset of NAT devices deployed. The algorithm consists of a series of tests to be performed by an application. When the path through the diagram ends in a red box, UDP communication is not possible and when the path ends in a yellow or green box, communication is possible. The methods of RFC 3489 proved too unreliable to cope with the plethora of different NAT implementations and application scenarios encountered in production networks. The STUN protocol and method were updated in RFC 5389, retaining many of the original specifications as a subset of methods, but removing others.

The title was changed in a specification of an updated set of methods published as RFC 5389, retaining the same acronym.

== Design ==

STUN is a tool for communications protocols to detect and traverse network address translators that are located in the path between two endpoints of communication. It is implemented as a light-weight client–server protocol, requiring only simple query and response components with a third-party server located on the common, easily accessible network, typically the Internet. The client side is implemented in the user&#x27;s communications application, such as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone or an instant messaging client. 

The basic protocol operates essentially as follows: The client, typically operating inside a private network, sends a &quot;binding request&quot; to a STUN server on the public Internet. The STUN server responds with a &quot;success response&quot; that contains the IP address and port number of the client, as observed from the server&#x27;s perspective. The result is obfuscated through exclusive or (XOR) mapping to avoid translation of the packet content by application layer gateways (ALGs) that perform deep packet inspection in an attempt to perform alternate NAT traversal methods.

STUN messages are sent in User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. Since UDP does not provide reliable transport, reliability is achieved by application-controlled retransmissions of the STUN requests. STUN servers do not implement any reliability mechanism for their responses. When reliability is mandatory, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) may be used, but induces extra networking overhead. In security-sensitive applications, STUN may be transported and encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS).

An application may automatically determine a suitable STUN server for communications with a particular peer by querying the Domain Name System (DNS) for the &quot;stun&quot; (for UDP) or &quot;stuns&quot; (for TCP/TLS) server (SRV) resource record, e.g., _stun._udp.example.com. The standard listening port number for a STUN server is 3478 for UDP and TCP, and 5349 for TLS. Alternatively, TLS may also be run on the TCP port if the server implementation can de-multiplex TLS and STUN packets. In case no STUN server is found using DNS lookups, the standard recommends that the destination domain name should be queried for address records (A or AAAA), which would be used with the default port numbers.

In addition to using protocol encryption with TLS, STUN also has built-in authentication and message-integrity mechanisms via specialized STUN packet types.

When a client has evaluated its external address, it can use this as a candidate for communicating with peers by sharing the external NAT address rather than the private address, which is not reachable from peers on the public network.

If both communicating peers are located in different private networks, each behind a NAT, the peers must coordinate to determine the best communication path between them. Some NAT behavior may restrict peer connectivity even when the public binding is known. The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol provides a structured mechanism to determine the optimal communication path between two peers. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) extensions are defined to enable the use of ICE when setting up a call between two hosts.

== Limitations ==

Network address translation is implemented via a number of different address and port mapping schemes, none of which is standardized.

STUN is not a self-contained NAT traversal solution applicable in all NAT deployment scenarios and does not work correctly with all of them. It is a tool among other methods and it is a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal, most notably Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) and Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).

STUN works with three types of NAT: full cone NAT, restricted cone NAT, and port restricted cone NAT. In the cases of restricted cone or port restricted cone NATs, the client must send out a packet to the endpoint before the NAT will allow packets from the endpoint through to the client. STUN does not work with symmetric NAT (also known as bi-directional NAT) which is often found in the networks of large companies. Since the IP address of the STUN server is different from that of the endpoint, in the symmetric NAT case, the NAT mapping will be different for the STUN server than for an endpoint. TURN offers better results with symmetric NAT.

<text>2004 Republican National Convention protest activity includes the broad range of marches, rallies, performances, demonstrations, exhibits, and acts of civil disobedience in New York City to protest the 2004 Republican National Convention and the nomination of President George W. Bush for the 2004 U.S. presidential election.

Hundreds of groups organized protests, including United for Peace and Justice, a coalition of more than 800 anti-war and social justice groups, and International ANSWER. Over 1800 individuals were arrested by the authorities, a record for a political convention in the U.S. However 90% of those charges were eventually dropped.

== Thursday, August 26 ==
Four young professionals and students, who called themselves Operation Sybil, hung a banner over the front of the Plaza Hotel. Two of them, including Terra Lawson-Remer, rappelled down the front of the hotel, after which they were able to hang the banner more than a dozen stories above the ground. The banner, which measured wide and roughly three stories high, said &quot;Truth,&quot; with an arrow pointing in one direction (toward Central Park, where the United for Peace March was supposed to take place) and &quot;Bush,&quot; with an arrow pointing the other direction (toward Madison Square Garden, the site of the convention). The four climbers were quickly arrested and the banner was removed by the police. One police officer was injured in the process when he stepped on a skylight and it broke. As a result of the officer&#x27;s injury, the climbers were charged with assault of a police officer along with their other charges.

Twelve AIDS activists from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) staged a naked protest in front of Madison Square Garden, demanding debt cancellation for poor countries. They took their clothes off in the crosswalk, stopping traffic, as they joined hands and began chanting &quot;Bush, Stop AIDS. Drop the Debt Now!&quot; &quot;Drop the Debt&quot; and &quot;Stop AIDS&quot; were stenciled in black paint on their chests and backs. Their intent was to tell &quot;the naked truth&quot; about Bush&#x27;s global AIDS policies – that they are inadequate, and that debt cancellation must be a top priority.

Seven of the protesters were completely naked, three were semi-clothed, and two others, who stood off to the side, were fully clothed, and held a large banner that read &quot;W: Drop the Debt. Stop AIDS.&quot; The two clothed activists climbed on top of a nearby trailer to make the banner more visible. They were later arrested and faced several charges, including endangerment of a police officer, which was a result of the fact that officers had to climb on top of the trailer, which was a generator, in order to arrest them.

Although there were several times as many police officers as there were protesters on the scene, it was seventeen minutes before the activists were arrested. They were represented by Ron Kuby, and all of the charges were later dropped. A few protesters who were semi-clothed were not arrested, and faced no charges.

The activists later became one of the subjects in photographer Richard Avedon&#x27;s last project, published in the New Yorker.

== Friday, August 27 ==
Between 5,000 and 6,000 participants took part in the Critical Mass bicycle ride. The monthly NYC Critical Mass ride promoted by the environmental group Time&#x27;s Up! occurs on the last Friday of each month and prior to this ride had usually attracted about 1,500 riders. Police eventually blockaded roads and arrested 264 people in relation to that event. Most of them were charged with disorderly conduct and held in custody for up to 72 hours. This was the first time the NYPD had made any significant arrests of Critical Mass participants in New York City.

== Sunday, August 29 ==

United for Peace and Justice organized the main march of the week, one of the largest protests in U.S. history, in which protesters marched past Madison Square Garden, the site of the convention. The march included hundreds of separate contingents as well as individual marchers. One Thousand Coffins, a nationwide group of citizens, veterans and clergy, held a procession of one thousand full-scale flag-draped coffins commemorating the fallen troops. Several hundred members of Billionaires for Bush held a mock countermarch. Estimates of crowd size ranged from 120,000 (unnamed police spokesman) to over 500,000 (organizers, second unnamed police source). In March, 2007 NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne stated about the RNC protests: &quot;You certainly had 800,000 on August 29.&quot;

Organizers held a pre-march press conference in front of thousands on 7th Avenue. Several people spoke in opposition to the war in Iraq and Bush administration policies including Michael Moore, Jesse Jackson, Congressman Charles Rangel, and a father who had lost his son in Iraq. The whole event lasted six hours, with the lead contingent finishing the march long before thousands of people could even move from the starting point. The City government, under Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had earlier denied the protesters a permit to hold a rally in Central Park following the march, citing concern for the park&#x27;s grass. The West Side Highway was offered instead, but organizers refused, citing exorbitant costs for the extra sound equipment and problems for the location. Organizers encouraged people to go to Central Park following the march&#x27;s conclusion in Union Square. Disturbances were minor, as New York Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly reported about 200 arrests with 9 felonies, most of them occurring after the march had concluded. Incidentally, this was also the day when the Protest Warrior and Communists for Kerry counter-protest groups held their main counter-demonstrations in support of Bush and the RNC.

For the most part, the march proceeded peacefully and without violence. The only major incident during the march occurred when some individuals of unknown affiliations torched a large dragon float between Madison Square Garden and the Fox News building. The float turned into a huge fireball, and the march was halted until firefighters were able to clear the street of debris. Later, there was a minor scuffle as some individuals tried to take some of the Protest Warriors&#x27; signs. There were isolated incidents of violent attacks against delegates according to Randal C. Archibold, writer from the New York Times. In his article, &quot;Protesters&#x27; Encounters With Delegates on the Town Turn Ugly,&quot; he discussed events that occurred in around the theater district, including one incident outside &quot;The Lion King&quot; on 42nd Street, in which a delegate is punched in the face by a protester running by.

== Monday, August 30 ==
Still We Rise, a coalition of 52 NYC-based community organizations for the poor and people of color, marched at noon from Union Square to Madison Square Garden, and held a rally by the Garden.

At 4 PM, the Poor People&#x27;s Economic Human Rights Campaign, a national campaign involving over sixty organizations, held a rally by the United Nations on the Dag Hammarskjold Plaza. Along with many homeless and poor people who have been marching with the PPEHRC through New Jersey and living in a &quot;mobile Bushville&quot; (which settled in Brooklyn a week before the convention), thousands thronged the streets despite having been denied a permit and marched down Second Avenue and up Eighth Avenue to Madison Square Garden, the police having decided not to stop the protesters. A few troublemakers apparently acting alone disrupted the march towards the end by tearing open police barricades, with one person attacking a plainclothes police detective who had driven his scooter into the crowd (see note below), knocking him unconscious. Police made several arrests and deployed tear gas.

There is considerable dispute involving this incident, as many eyewitnesses said they had no idea this was a policeman, who intentionally rammed his motorcycle straight into a dense crowd, hitting and injuring people, which started the altercation. One source said: &quot;The divide and arrest tactics used by the police in the march have been seen in the past several days in New York here, and as have the use of undercover officers, mopeds and motorcycles.&quot; Another source stated: &quot;Eyewitness reports confirmed that an undercover police officer in a scooter rammed his way into the throngs of protesters, driving as fast as 20 miles an hour, as the police were splitting the crowd, before being knocked off and beaten by an angry demonstrator. &#x27;What kind of person would ram into dozens of people in a scooter with a line of police behind him?&#x27; asked protester Gonzalo Hereda afterwards in disbelief.&quot;

== Tuesday, August 31 ==
A group called the A31 Action Coalition called for massive civil disobedience on Tuesday, August 31.

Members of CODEPINK and others gathered in front of Fox News Channel&#x27;s headquarters in New York City and held a &quot;Fox News Shut-Up-A-Thon.&quot; About 1,000 people protested the network, complaining about lack of balance and deriding it as a propaganda arm of the Republican Party.

Most of the protesters from the War Resisters League didn&#x27;t get very far from the World Trade Center on their 3-mile procession to the RNC convention at Madison Square Garden. They crossed one block and 227 of them were instantly surrounded by police and arrested. The several hundred remaining in the WRL contingent proceeded up a different route and got closer to the convention, and did a &quot;die-in&quot; in the street where 54 more were arrested.

== Protest from within the convention ==
Throughout the convention, there were several protesters who were able to sneak into Madison Square Garden and disrupt the speakers at the podium. Some even described it as surprisingly easy. Anti-war activists from CODEPINK disrupted primetime addresses three nights in a row and twice during George W. Bush&#x27;s acceptance speech. The father of one of the first U.S. servicemen killed in Iraq was ejected after holding up a sign that read &quot;Bush Lied. My Son Died.&quot;

Eleven AIDS activists from ACT UP also infiltrated the convention center during the Republican Youth Convention, chanting anti-Bush slogans and disrupting the event.
One female protester holding a sign was subdued by security, and alleged that she was kicked by a member of the Young Republicans while she was on the ground. Video of this event was shot by a local news station, but it proved to be inconclusive, because while it showed the Republican making kicking motions, it didn&#x27;t show that any contact was made. News of the alleged attack spread through the blogosphere, leading a website to identify a person who they believed was the alleged attacker. The female protester who was kicked then came forward and said she would consider pressing charges; however, she later decided that it was more worthwhile to expend her energy fighting AIDS. The identity of the alleged attacker has not been conclusively confirmed. The eleven ACT UP protesters were charged with disorderly conduct, 2nd and 3rd degree assault, and inciting a riot (1 violation, 1 misdemeanor, and 2 felonies), although all of the charges were dropped. A twelfth individual, not associated with ACT UP, was also arrested with them for taking pictures of the action.

== Controversial police tactics ==

Concerns have been raised about police tactics in arresting nonviolent protesters with many apparently innocent people being swept up in mass arrests. For instance, a lawyer, along with 1,000 other people, was detained in a facility by the New York City Police Department in such conditions that he said that the city had created its &quot;own little Guantanamo on the Hudson&quot;, referring to the tortures reported in prisoners camps in Guantanamo Bay. The police closed a street adjoining Union Square where protesters were marching, arresting protesters and bystanders alike. People were required to show identification cards or face arrest; the arrested people were not immediately informed of charges against them.

The facility was the then-recently closed Hudson Pier Depot at Pier 57 on the Hudson River, a three-story, block-long pier that has been converted into a temporary prison, though unfit for detention of prisoners. Arrested protesters have complained about extremely poor conditions describing it as overcrowded, dirty, and contaminated with oil and asbestos. People reported having suffered from smell, bad ventilation, and even chemical burns and rashes.

On May 17, 2006 Amy Goodman, host of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, reported on the FBI launch of a criminal civil rights investigation of NYPD after Gulf War veteran Dennis Kyne went to trial and had all charges dropped due to video evidence showing the police falsified reports and sworn testimony.

In 2014, the city settled the lawsuits. $6.4 million was paid to 430 individual plaintiffs. $6.6 million was paid to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by 1,200 additional people. The legal fees were $5 million. The city did not admit any wrongdoing. One of the plaintiffs, artist Constantina Zavistanos, has incorporated her settlement into the art work &quot;Sweepstakes&quot; where viewers are given a portion of the settlement.

Numerous cases were reported, notably:
* A 15-year-old diabetic girl on her way to a movie was arrested.
* A former vice president of Morgan Stanley was arrested while riding her bicycle.
* A 16-year-old protester was lost to her mother for two days, even though her mother knew about and supported her daughter&#x27;s participation.
* One of the most prominent personalities arrested was Eric Corley &quot;Emmanuel Goldstein&quot;, an important advocate of public rights and independent media, and editor of &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot;.
* Small pens were used to contain &quot;30 to 40 people&quot; at once.
* Many people were detained longer than 24 hours on relatively trivial charges. One was a 23-year-old Montreal student arrested for disorderly conduct and released three days later. &quot;He says he spent a total of 57 hours between the pier and Central Booking, during which time he says he was moved 14 times and repeatedly handcuffed and shackled to other protesters as young as 15.&quot;

The New York Times has also reported on two occasions that the police videotaped and infiltrated protests, as well as acting as agents provocateurs during the protests. In addition, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that prior to the protests, NYPD officers traveled as far away as Europe and spied on people there who planned to protest at the RNC.
The City reportedly refused to release the prisoners until a judge threatened to fine it for every extra hour every prisoner would spend in prison. The victims of the arrests have filed lawsuits against the City of New York. Several cases have since gone to court, and it has come out that the charges of resisting arrest in those cases were completely fabricated. Video evidence was shown of defendants complying peaceably with police demands. Many of the cases have since been summarily dismissed. Some of them, as of 2011, however, remain open and are expected to proceed to trial.

<doc id="937611" wikidata="Q1835523" url="?curid=937611" title="Western Maryland">
<text>Western Maryland, also known as the Maryland panhandle or Mountain Maryland, is the portion of the U.S. state of Maryland that typically consists of Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett counties. The region is bounded by the Mason-Dixon line (Pennsylvania) to the north, the Potomac River and West Virginia to the south, and Preston County, West Virginia to the west. At one point, at the town of Hancock, the northern and southern boundaries are separated by just 1.8 miles, the narrowest stretch in the state.

Western Maryland is more rural than the Washington-Baltimore area, where most of the state&#x27;s population lives, and is noted for its mountainous terrain. The area is in the central Appalachians. Washington, Allegany, and Garrett counties are part of the Appalachian Regional Commission. The most populous community in Western Maryland is Hagerstown, located in Washington County, the most populous county in the region. Major highways in Western Maryland include Interstate Highways I-70, I-81 and I-68; U.S. Highways U.S. 11, U.S. 40, U.S. 40 ALT, U.S. 219 and U.S. 50; and several state highways.

==Climate==
The climate of Western Maryland is more akin to the mountains of northern West Virginia than to any other part of Maryland. Summers tend to be much cooler than in the rest of the state, and winters harsher. Temperatures in winter can drop to below on around eight nights per winter, and snowfall averages from farther east to over in the higher elevations. In comparison, Prince George&#x27;s County, in the eastern part of the Washington metropolitan area, would previously average only of snow and wintertime maxima exceeded on a third of all days.

Below is climate data for Hagerstown, the largest city in Western Maryland, located in Washington County, the easternmost and lowest elevation county in Western Maryland.
Below is climate data for Oakland, located in Garrett County, the westernmost and highest elevation county in Western Maryland.

==History==

In 1748, the Western Maryland population was finally large enough to create a new county called Frederick County; at the time, the county stretched further west than it does today. In the earliest part of the colonial days, German immigrants that came from Pennsylvania had the most influence on the development of the plains and valleys of Western Maryland.

Named for George Washington, Washington County was founded in 1776, by division of Frederick County. The largest city in this county is Hagerstown. It was named after Jonathan Hager, a German settler.

In 1785, the city of Cumberland, which is in Allegany County, was established. The County was the home for many pioneers, when they would travel through the Cumberland Narrows, a 1,000 foot high gap. This gap forms the main pass through the Allegheny Mountains to the west. In the mid-18th century, English settlers came to the county and began to mine and create towns and farms. This county was important for transportation for many travelers heading west. They would pass through by many forms of transportation, including canal, train, and horse and buggy.

The westernmost county in the state, Garrett County, was the last part of Maryland to be settled in 1764. The county was founded in 1872 by John Work Garrett, the B&amp;O Railroad president.

===Appalachian development===

The Appalachian Regional Development Act was created and passed in 1965 in an effort to correct the poverty issue, and the growing economic problems in the Appalachian region (13 States). According to the State of Maryland Appalachian Development Plan, the Act was passed because: (1) One in every three Appalachians lived in poverty; (2) Per capita income was 23% less than the US average; and (3) High unemployment and harsh living conditions had, in the 1950s, forced more than 2 million Appalachian people to leave their homes and seek work in other regions.

For the state of Maryland, this act was intended to bring awareness to the poverty levels of the Western Maryland counties. The program that was developed for this act was called the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The main goal of the ARC was to improve the development of the economy, and bring this region into socioeconomic parity with the rest of the nation.

===Annexation attempt by West Virginia===

In 2021 a delegation of Maryland Republican legislators George Edwards, Jason Buckel, Mike McKay and Wendell Beitzel traveled to Charleston, West Virginia, to petition the state of West Virginia annexing the Western Maryland counties via a referendum. Although they only named Garrett and Allegany counties by name, McKay also represents Washington County. A letter dated to October 14 called for Allegany and Garrett counties become “constituent counties of West Virginia” and was sent to West Virginia Speaker of the House Roger Hanshaw and Senate President Craig Blair. Howell stated “Our legislature is extremely honored that these three counties want to join our state, we take the request extremely seriously. They reached out to us. We have informed our governor and he is very receptive. I look at it like this, if Annapolis has nothing to fear, they will let the people in those three counties have their vote. We think they fit in very well with West Virginia.”

Howell then suggested a meeting between top state officials from the two states to meet at the Greater Cumberland Regional Airport to discuss the details further, suggesting that West Virginia would be willing to pay $1.5 billion for the counties. Jake Shade, who was running against McKay in the primaries, criticized the proposal due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. West Virginia Governor Jim Justice endorsed the proposal on October 25, however, by then Edwards and Buckel had retracted their support for annexation, and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan denounced the effort as “a mistake” and “just a game for attention” as the effort largely petered out due to lack of any sign of support in Annapolis.

==County population==
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the three westernmost counties of Maryland have a population of 252,614, accounting for 4.4% of the population of Maryland.

The most populated county is Washington County, which is home to approximately 147,430 people. Allegany County is the next most populated county with 75,087 people, while Garrett County is the least populated with 30,097 people.

==Major communities==
The following are some of the major cities in Western Maryland by county, in descending order of population, along with the city population of the 2020 census.

Washington County:
* Hagerstown (43,527)
* Boonsboro (3,336)
* Smithsburg (2,975)
* Williamsport (2,137)
* Hancock (1,546)

==Economy==

Western Maryland has a heavily agricultural economy. Its best-known crops are the apples grown in the Cumberland Valley, but corn, potatoes, beans, and varieties of green-leaf vegetables are grown as well. Mixed crop and livestock farms are common, and the region has a large number of dairy cattle farms.

==Tourism==
Tourism is very important to Western Maryland. There is a thriving tourist industry, and has been noted as having &quot;potential for significant growth.&quot;

Western Maryland has a number of sites with significance for military history, particularly the Civil War. In 1862, Washington County was home to one of the Civil War&#x27;s bloodiest single-day battles at Antietam National Battlefield.

Western Maryland, particularly Cumberland, is also home to transportation themed tourism. The Downtown Cumberland Historic District is a National Register Historic District, and Cumberland&#x27;s Western Maryland Railway Station is a popular site.

Garrett County is also well known for its numerous state parks and outdoor activities. Places such as Deep Creek Lake in Garrett County are frequented by many visitors every year. The largest lake in Western Maryland is Deep Creek Lake in Garrett County. The 4,000 acre body of water is owned by the State of Maryland and is man made. Construction began in 1920 and the lake was filled by 1929. It was originally made to power a small scale hydroelectric plant, but was eventually turned into a tourist destination. The lake is currently managed for boating and fishing, although it still provides some water to generate electricity. The Deep Creek Lake State Park offers fishing piers, beach and swim area, covered pavilions, and opportunities for camping.

Maryland&#x27;s only ski resort, Wisp Ski Resort, is located on a 172 acre property next to Deep Creek Lake. Hosting a year-round mountain coaster and cross country skiing and snowmobiling in the winter, it is a major tourist attraction in the region.

==Sports==
Sports teams in Western Maryland include the following:

Garrett County along the Savage River has played host to two ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in 1989 and 2014.

==Education==

Colleges in Western Maryland include:
*Allegany College of Maryland – community college
*Frostburg State University 
*Garrett College – community college
*Hagerstown Community College – community college

==Potential state==
In 2014, it was reported that some residents want the region to form a new state, which would include Garrett, Allegany, Washington, Frederick, and Carroll counties. Local supporters of partitioning western Maryland (dubbed &quot;the Western Maryland Initiative&quot;) cited a perception of political domination by the more populous eastern portion of the state, particularly with reference to such issues as gun control, taxation, and same-sex marriage.

<doc id="937618" wikidata="Q1007545" url="?curid=937618" title="Galatasaray High School">
<text>Galatasaray High School; , ), established in Istanbul in 1481, is the oldest and highly selective high school in Turkey. It is also the second-oldest Turkish educational institution after Istanbul University, which was established in 1453. The name &quot;Galatasaray&quot; means &quot;Galata Palace&quot;, as the school is located at the far end of Galata, the medieval Genoese enclave above the Golden Horn in what is now the district of Beyoğlu.

Admission to Galatasaray High School is determined through nationwide entrance examinations, with successful candidates representing the top 0.03% of students. The institution integrates elements of Turkish and French educational curricula, providing instruction in both languages and upholding a longstanding tradition of academic rigor.

The association football club Galatasaray S.K. was formed by and named after the institution, with the footballers in the club&#x27;s formative years consisting entirely of pupils from the school. Galatasaray High School is the progenitor of the Galatasaray Community, which includes the football club, its parent Galatasaray Sports Club, and Galatasaray University.

Galatasaray has been the alma mater of numerous prominent figures in art, literature, diplomacy, politics, and other fields, with many Galatasaray alumni making notable contributions to their respective areas.

== History ==
=== Origins (1481–1830) ===


Sultan Bayezid II founded the &quot;Galata Sarayı Enderun-u Hümayunu&quot; (English: Galata Palace Imperial School) in 1481. The sultan often roamed the city, disguised as an ordinary citizen and legend has it that on one of these rambles he found a garden in Galata filled with beautiful red and yellow roses. In this garden, he met &quot;Gül Baba&quot; (English: Father Rose) of the Bektashi Order. The Sultan asked the wise man about how to improve the Empire and the city as they filled with immigrants. &quot;Gül Baba&quot; explained that he was happy with the city, his rose garden and the reign of the Sultan, but he would be even happier if there was a school which would educate students from this diverse range of backgrounds, as this would train the wise men needed to serve such a large Empire. He told the Sultan he would be proud to serve as a teacher in this school in order to create a generation of valuable subjects for the Empire. Bayezid II took &quot;Gül Baba&quot; at his word and returned to the garden weeks later with the edict which established the Ottoman Imperial School in the grounds next to the rose garden, with &quot;Gül Baba&quot; as its headmaster. &quot;Gül Baba&quot; became the first headmaster of Galatasaray and administered the school for many years. He died during the Ottoman raid on Hungary and his tomb is located in Budapest.

When the Ottoman army went to war, dervishes and minstrels accompanied it to provide prayers and entertainment but also armed themselves and joined in the fighting when necessary. &quot;Gül Baba&quot; was one of these dervishes.

=== Interim period (1830–1868) ===
Galata Palace Imperial School remained open until the 1830s, when the Tanzimat movement for reform and reorganisation drastically altered the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s old establishment. Sultan Mahmud II replaced the Imperial School with the Ottoman Medical School, staffed largely by French professors with most courses taught in French. The Medical School was based in the Galatasaray (&quot;lit.&quot; Galata Palace) buildings for some thirty years.

The initial French name was &quot;Lycée Imperial Ottoman de Galataserai&quot;.

=== Modern period (1868–1923) ===
Sultan Abdülaziz was the first Ottoman sultan to travel to Europe and, while in France, was impressed by the French educational system. On his return to Istanbul, he announced the Edict on Public Education which established a free compulsory education system for children under twelve. In September 1868, the &quot;Lycée Impérial Ottoman de Galata-Sérai&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Galatasaray Mekteb-i Sultanisi&quot;) was established based on the &quot;lycée&quot; model. French was the main language of instruction, and many teachers were European. The students included members of all the religious and ethnic communities of the Ottoman Empire.

From 1868 to 1878, most of the students were non Muslims, many of whom were Bulgarian.

Since this period, the district where the school stands has been known as Galatasaray. In 1905, the Galatasaray Sports Club was founded by Ali Sami Yen and his friends in one of the school&#x27;s classrooms, Literature 5B.

In 1907 a fire broke out in the school and burnt its wooden buildings to the ground. The library, museum and archive were all lost; only some stones of the external walls survived. The school was briefly relocated to Beylerbeyi but in 1909 the students were able to return to a new stone building on the site.

=== Establishment of the Republic of Turkey to Integrated Education System (1923–1992) ===

With the abolition of the Ottoman Empire and the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the school&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Galatasaray Lisesi&quot; (English: Galatasaray High School or French: Lycée de Galatasaray). Instruction was conducted in Turkish and French, and the school consisted of an Elementary School for five years and a Lycée for seven years, with French Language and Literature, Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English, and German taught selectively in the final four years. The school became co-educational in 1965, and female students now constitute at least 40% of the school&#x27;s pupils. One of the main buildings of the Feriye Palace on the Bosphorus, in the Ortaköy district, was given to the school when it needed to expand.

Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, visited Galatasaray three times: on December 2, 1930; January 28, 1932; and July 1, 1933.

=== Integrated Education System (1992–present) ===

In the 1990s, Galatasaray High School entered another period of transformation. The signing of the Turkish-French Bilateral Agreement of 1992 led to the foundation of Galatasaray University which essentially grew out of the &quot;Lycée&quot;. With the addition of a new primary education school, the three units emerged as autonomous components of an integrated education system under the aegis of the university.

Admission to the High School (or &quot;Lycée&quot;) is by selective examinations and about one hundred children a year are admitted. Many graduates of the High School continue their education at Galatasaray University, where 25 percent of the enrolment quota is reserved for them.

Until 1997, the High School provided eight years of education. After children had completed the five-year compulsory primary school course, they undertook two years of preparatory, three years of junior high, and three years of senior high school education. In the 2003–2004 academic year Galatasaray High School became a five-year senior high school, with the introduction of the eight-year compulsory primary education system in Turkey, including one year of preparation.

Galatasaray has a diverse student body, with students coming from every part of the country. The current curriculum consists of a blend of Turkish and French curricula, plus a number of additional language courses and elective subjects. Courses on Turkish literature, geography, history, ethics, and art are taught in Turkish, while French Literature, philosophy, sociology, mathematics, and science courses use French as the language of instruction. In addition, English is taught in the primary school from the sixth grade, while Italian and Latin are taught in the high school. There is also some exposure to Ottoman Turkish, Persian, and Arabic through literature and religion classes, as well as Greek through French classes.

The students set up an English Club in 1997, which also started to participate in the Harvard Model United Nations Conferences and the European Youth Parliament&#x27;s International Sessions and other events through the year. The school itself started to organize its own Model United Nations conference, albeit the club itself is closed indefinitely.

The &quot;Lycée de Galatasaray&quot; diploma is equivalent to the French &quot;Baccalaureate&quot;, and graduates of Galatasaray are admitted to universities in France without further examinations.

== Education ==
The school years break down as follows:

French Prep (One year)

Lyceum (Four years) — Admission through the National Secondary Education Institutions Entrance Exam

University (Four years) — Admission through the National University Entrance Exam

In 2003, an eight-year primary school system which integrated the previous five years of elementary school and three years of junior high under a single body was introduced. Under this new system, the one year prep and four-year junior high education were transitioned into the primary school.
