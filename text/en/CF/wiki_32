<text>The National Legion of Decency, also known as the Catholic Legion of Decency, was an American Catholic group founded in 1934 by the Archbishop of Cincinnati, John T. McNicholas, as an organization dedicated to identifying objectionable content in motion pictures on behalf of Catholic audiences. Members were asked to pledge to patronize only those motion pictures which did not &quot;offend decency and Christian morality&quot;. The concept soon gained support from other churches.

Condemnation by the Legion would often diminish a film&#x27;s chances for success because it meant the population of Catholics, some twenty million strong at the time (plus their Protestant allies), would avoid attending any screening of the film. The efforts to help parishioners avoid films with objectionable content sometimes backfired when it was found that they helped draw attention to those films. Although the Legion was often envisioned as a bureaucratic arm of the Catholic Church, it instead was little more than a loose confederation of local organizations, with each diocese appointing a local Legion director, usually a parish priest, who was responsible for Legion activities in that diocese. Film historian Bernard F. Dick wrote: &quot;Although the Legion was never officially an organ of the Catholic Church, and its movie ratings were nonbinding, many Catholics were still guided by the Legion&#x27;s classifications.&quot;

In 1965, The National Legion of Decency was reorganized as the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures (NCOMP). In 1980, NCOMP ceased operations, along with the biweekly Review, which by then had published ratings for 16,251 feature films. 

==Background==
From the early days of cinema, the motion picture industry made several attempts to self-regulate the content of films to avoid the creation of numerous state and municipal censorship boards. Most of these efforts were relatively ineffectual.

===National Board of Review===
On December 24, 1908, New York City Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. revoked all moving-picture exhibition licenses in the city pending inspection of the premises due to fire safety concerns regarding the highly flammable celluloid film. He stated that due to complaints from the city&#x27;s clergy and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, upon re-issuance, the licensees were prohibited from operating on Sunday. He further indicated his intention to revoke the license of any motion picture show &quot;...on evidence that pictures have been exhibited by the licensees which tend to degrade or injure the morals of the community.&quot;

In 1909, Charles Sprague Smith and about a dozen prominent individuals from the fields of social work, religion, and education, formed a committee, under the auspices of the People&#x27;s Institute at Cooper Union, to make recommendations to the Mayor&#x27;s office concerning controversial films. Initially called the New York Board of Motion Picture Censorship it soon became known as the National Board of Motion Picture Censorship. To avoid government censorship of films, the National Board became the unofficial clearinghouse for new movies. The Board&#x27;s stated purpose was to endorse films of merit and champion the new &quot;art of the people&quot;. In March 1916 the Board changed its name to the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures to avoid the controversial word &quot;censorship&quot;.

===National Association of the Motion Picture Industry (NAMPI)===
The National Association of the Motion Picture Industry was an industry self-regulatory body created by the Hollywood studios in 1916 to answer demands for film censorship by states and municipalities. The Association devised &quot;Thirteen Points&quot;, a list of subjects and storylines they promised to avoid. However, there was no method of enforcement if a studio film violated the Thirteen Points content restrictions, and NAMPI proved ineffective.

=== Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA)===
After several risqué films and a series of notorious off-screen scandals involving Hollywood stars, political pressure was increasing, with legislators in 37 states introducing almost one hundred movie censorship bills in 1921. Faced with the prospect of having to comply with hundreds, and potentially thousands, of inconsistent and easily changed decency laws to show their movies, the studios chose self-regulation as the preferable option. In 1922, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) was formed. Will H. Hays was named the association&#x27;s first president. The goal of the organization was to rehabilitate the image of the movie industry in the wake of the Arbuckle scandal and amid growing calls by primarily Protestant groups for federal censorship of the movies. &quot;Hiring Hays to “clean up the pictures” was, at least in part, a public relations ploy, and much was made of his conservative credentials, including his roles as a Presbyterian deacon and past chairman of the Republican Party.&quot;

In 1924, Hays instituted &quot;The Formula&quot;, a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. &quot;The Formula&quot; requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays&#x27;s office, nor to follow his recommendations.

In 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of &quot;Don&#x27;ts and Be Carefuls&quot; for the industry. This list outlined the issues that movies could encounter in different localities. Again, despite Hays&#x27; efforts, studios largely ignored the &quot;Don&#x27;ts and Be Carefuls,&quot; and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts before production, and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase. However, a number of the items listed would become part of the later Code.

====The Production Code====
Martin J. Quigley was publisher of &quot;Exhibitors Herald-World&quot; (a trade magazine for independent exhibitors). Daniel A. Lord was a Jesuit priest who had served as one of the technical consultants on Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1927 &quot;The King of Kings&quot;. Quigley drafted Lord to write a code for motion pictures. With the blessing of Cardinal George W. Mundelein of Chicago, Father Lord authored the code, which later became known as &quot;The Production Code&quot;, &quot;The Code&quot;, and &quot;The Hays Code&quot;. It was presented to Will Hays in 1930 and privately circulated by the MPPDA.

The studio heads were less than enthusiastic but after some revisions, agreed to make The Code the rule of the industry, albeit with many loopholes that allowed studio producers to override the Hays Office&#x27;s application of it. One main reason in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. Tasked with enforcing the code was the Studio Relations Committee, which very soon was overwhelmed by the number of films to view. The committee had a small staff and not much influence. Without the power to compel the editing of content deemed problematic, it was left with attempting to persuade the studios to make changes. From 1930 to 1934, the Production Code was only slightly effective in fighting back calls for federal censorship. The SRC was considered generally ineffective. Lord considered the code a failure.

== History ==
Catholic bishops and laypeople tended to be leery of federal censorship and favored the Hays approach of self-censorship, and the influence of public opinion.
The Catholic Legion of Decency was organized in 1934 under the auspices of Cincinnati Archbishop John T. McNicholas. Members were asked to sign a pledge promising to &quot;remain away from all motion pictures except those which do not offend decency and Christian morality.&quot; The idea soon caught on with other churches. The Episcopal magazine &quot;The Living Church&quot; printed the pledge for its readers to sign. It was also promoted by the Protestant Detroit Council of Churches. As its influence spread, the organization adopted the name &quot;National Legion of Decency&quot; (NLD).

Initially, the Legion of Decency provided no official guide to good and bad films but left it up to individual priests and bishops to determine what was or was not morally acceptable. Some Catholics proposed announcing only lists of films approved for viewing so as not to publicize the names of films judged unsuitable. The Diocese of Brooklyn used a list drawn up by the Federation of Catholic Alumnae.

During the early years, the Legion established a rating system that assessed films based on their moral content. The films were graded on a scale from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C,&quot; with “A” being morally permissible and “C” being morally unacceptable, or, &quot;condemned.&quot; One of the first foreign films condemned was the 1933 Czechoslovak erotic romantic drama &quot;Ecstasy&quot; which featured an eighteen-year-old Hedy Lamarr swimming nude and chasing naked after her runaway horse, as well as an illicit affair and a suicide. This was not a particularly difficult decision. After a Vatican journalist attended a screening at the Venice Film Festival, Pope Pius XI denounced it in the Vatican newspaper. Criticized by women&#x27;s groups, it was also banned by the Pennsylvania state censor.

The Legion also published and distributed pamphlets and fliers encouraging Catholics not to view certain films it viewed as immoral. The Legion was often more conservative in its views on films than the Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s Production Code. The early thirties saw a number of exploitation film features that claimed to warn the public about various kinds of shocking sin and depravity corrupting society. In reality, these films were cynical, profit-motivated vehicles that wallowed in lurid, taboo subjects, such as: drug abuse, promiscuous sex, venereal disease, polygamy, child marriages, etc. Some included brief nude scenes. One such film condemned by the Legion was 1935&#x27;s &quot;The Pace That Kills&quot;, which dealt with cocaine addiction, amorality and prostitution.

For the first few decades, the Legion had a significant influence on the entertainment industry. Their influence stemmed from the popularity of their rating system, their skillful lobbying, and the circulation of a pledge at church services. From the 1930s through the 1960s, Catholic parishes in dioceses across the country administered yearly pledges in which millions of Catholics throughout the U.S. vowed to refuse to watch films that were condemned by the Legion. &quot;Although the Legion was never officially an organ of the Catholic Church, and its movie ratings were nonbinding, many Catholics were still guided by the Legion&#x27;s classifications.&quot;

With the Legion of Decency rating films independently, and pressure on the industry from several Protestant and women&#x27;s groups, Hays, who had been in charge of enforcing the voluntary code since 1927, worried that the NLD&#x27;s efforts could weaken his power and that of his office and hurt industry profits. Several states continued to have state censors, and the Archdiocese of Chicago maintained its own list of film ratings. The MPPDA created a new department, the Production Code Administration (PCA), to administer the Motion Picture Production Code. Hays appointed conservative Catholic Joseph Breen to head it.

In 1957, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical &quot;Miranda Prorsus&quot; (&quot;The Remarkable Inventions&quot;), which suggested that Catholics should be more concerned about encouraging good movies than condemning bad ones, an approach taken earlier by the National Board of Review. The Legion revised its ratings process, increased the members of its ratings panel with individuals knowledgeable in film and communication arts, and added two new ratings categories: A-III, for adults only, and A-IV, for adults with reservations.

Professor James Skinner wrote that by the late 1950s and early to mid-1960s, the Legion was beginning to lose its influence both within Hollywood and within the Catholic Church. Skinner noted that in some cases, young Catholics throughout the country saw a “C” rating as a reason to see a particular film. He argued that as a result of the Church’s liberalization after the Second Vatican Council, and a decline in the initial enthusiasm for the Legion, the Legion ceased to exist by the mid 1960s. In 1965, the Legion was restructured as the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures (NCOMP), but scholars such as Skinner argue that the NCOMP failed to exert as much influence over Hollywood as the Legion.

== Rating system ==
The original ratings of:

* A: Morally unobjectionable, 
* B: Morally objectionable in part, and 
* C: Condemned

were subsequently expanded by separating &quot;A&quot; into:

* A-I, for general patronage, and 
* A-II, for adults and adolescents only, to distinguish films suitable for children from those more appropriate for older viewers.

Additional categories of A-III, for adults only, and A-IV, for adults with reservations were later added.

The Legion of Decency condemned several films for morally offensive content. This was reflected in a &quot;C&quot; rating. Practicing Catholics were directed to refrain from viewing such films. More explicitly, they were directed to &quot;remain away from all motion pictures except those which do not offend decency and Christian morality.&quot;

Most motion pictures receiving a &quot;C&quot; rating were foreign films. Since it reviewed films when released for distribution, the Legion usually rated non-U.S. films a few years after their first release in their country of origin, occasionally years after. One such film was Jean Renoir&#x27;s 1938 &quot;La Bête Humaine&quot; about a homicidal alcoholic. Frank S. Nugent, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said even though he gave the film a positive review, he felt uncomfortable watching it. &quot;It is hardly a pretty picture, dealing as it does with a man whose tainted blood subjects him to fits of homicidal mania... Sitting here, a safe distance from it, we are not at all sure we entirely approve of it or its telling.&quot;

Sometimes the Hollywood studios would work with the Legion to avoid a &quot;C&quot; rating that might harm a film&#x27;s distribution and profitability. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer made revisions to the 1940 &quot;Strange Cargo&quot; and the Legion changed its rating to &quot;unobjectionable for adults&quot;. Columbia Pictures removed fifteen lines of dialogue from &quot;This Thing Called Love&quot; and the Legion revised the rating to &quot;B&quot;. (The film was banned in Ireland, Australia, and British Columbia).

By the late fifties, films considered &quot;problematic&quot; were viewed by the Legion two or three times; first by the staff and then by consultants who provided written evaluations. Invariably, the Legion was considered too liberal by some, and too cautious by others.

The C rating was issued from 1933 until the end of 1981. On January 1, 1982, the B and C ratings were combined into a new O rating for &quot;morally offensive&quot; films, and NCOMP began to reassign ratings to some older films based on its new system.

== Pledge ==
The pledge was revised in 1934:
In 1938, the league requested that the &quot;Pledge of the Legion of Decency&quot; be administered each year on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8).

== United States Conference of Catholic Bishops&#x27; Office for Film and Broadcasting ==
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops&#x27; Office for Film and Broadcasting was an office of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and is best known for the USCCB film rating, a continuation of the National Legion of Decency rating system begun in 1933 by Archbishop of Cincinnati John T. McNicholas, OP.

After the National Catholic Office of Motion Pictures was re-established in 1960, it later became the Office of Film and Broadcasting (OFB). The Office of Film and Broadcasting merged with the National Catholic Office for Radio and Television in 1980. Together they reviewed motion pictures, radio, and television using the same rating scale the original Legion of Decency did in the 1930s and 1940s. They shared the same goal, which was to rid the screen of stories that lowered traditional moral standards and persuaded people, especially young people to accept false principles of conduct. By 1990 the National Catholic Office for Radio and Television collapsed leaving the Office of Film and Broadcasting to review strictly motion pictures. The Office of Film and Broadcasting worked to review every movie in the United States still adhering to the original rating system.

The organization had been run by the United States Catholic Conference in their Communications Department but was later joined with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and renamed the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2001. The Office of Film and Broadcasting carried the same film rating system as the Legion of Decency. The rating &quot;A&quot; meant morally unobjectionable but falling into the subcategories of AI: Suitable for all audiences, AII: Suitable for adults and adolescents, and AIII: Suitable for adults only. The next ratings were &quot;B&quot;, which meant morally objectionable in part, and &quot;C&quot;, which meant it was condemned by the Legion of Decency. The Office of Motion Pictures began with the intention to rate every motion picture made in the United States and labored for 45 years.

=== Controversies ===
In the 1970s, controversies grew surrounding the intense rating system and inconsistent reviews. Examples of films which received the A-IV rating include &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, two films whose content was seen by many as being exaggerated by the mainstream press, perhaps leading to the wrong interpretations and false conclusions cited in the rating&#x27;s full description. In 1995, the description was changed to films &quot;which are not morally offensive in themselves but are not for casual viewing”. Ultimately, the Office of Film and Broadcasting shut down in 2010. The USCCB continued to voluntarily provide information and film ratings for Catholics through the Catholic News Service. The Catholic News Service also gave access to archived reviews dating from 2011 and prior.

On 4 May 2022, Catholic News Service announced that it would cease its operations in the United States on 31 December 2022 due to a decision of the USCCB. The news agency&#x27;s domestic distribution platform and archives were acquired by &quot;Our Sunday Visitor&quot; and used to launch the new OSV News.

<doc id="949099" wikidata="Q182629" url="?curid=949099" title="Promession">
<text>Promession is an idea of how to dispose human remains by way of freeze drying. The concept of promession was developed by Swedish biologist Susanne Wiigh-Mäsak, who derived the name from the Italian word for &quot;promise&quot; (&quot;promessa&quot;). She founded Promessa Organic AB in 1997 to commercially pursue her idea. The company went bankrupt in 2015 without being able to produce a functioning facility. The idea of promession is questioned and not a functional method according to critics.

==Process==

The idea of promession involves five steps:
# Coffin separation: the body is placed into the chamber
# Cryogenic freezing: liquid nitrogen at −196 °C crystallizes the body
# Vibration: the body is disintegrated into particles within minutes
# Freeze drying: particles are freeze dried in a drying chamber, leaving approximately 30% of the original weight
# Metal separation: any metals (e.g., tooth amalgam, artificial hips, etc.) are removed, either by magnetism or by sieving. The dry powder is placed in a biodegradable casket which is interred in the top layers of soil, where aerobic bacteria decompose the remains into humus in as little as 6–12 months.

== Criticism ==
Promession as a functional method is questioned. No facility for promession has been built or put into service. Critics argue that there is a physical impossibility to atomize a freeze dried human body in this way.

==Current status==
Promessa Organic AB was liquidated in 2015 without being able to produce a functioning module or facility.

<doc id="949112" wikidata="Q1548883" url="?curid=949112" title="Rice Lake (Ontario)">
<text>Rice Lake is a lake located in Northumberland and Peterborough counties in south-eastern Ontario. The lake is located south of the city of Peterborough, and the Kawartha Lakes and north of Cobourg. It is part of the Trent-Severn Waterway, which flows into the lake by the Otonabee and out via the Trent. The lake is long and 5 km wide. Its maximum depth is 10m, with a surface water level at 187 m above sea level, raised to its present height by the Hastings Dam, built in the 19th century as part of the Trent-Severn canal system. The Indigenous Mississaugas called it &quot;Pemadashdakota&quot; or &quot;lake of the burning plains&quot;.

A drumlin field is located northwest of the lake, and the lake&#x27;s islands are partially submerged drumlins. Rice Lake nearly bisects the Oak Ridges Moraine, with three wedges to the west (&quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Uxbridge&quot; and &quot;Pontypool&quot;), and one wedge to the east (&quot;Rice Lake&quot;) which has terminus at the Trent River. A narrow corridor to the south of Rice Lake connects these wedges.

Rice Lake is fairly shallow and was named for the wild rice which grew in it and was harvested by native people of the area. Most of the extensive stands of wild rice originally found in here were wiped out when water levels were raised in the lake by the construction of the waterway.

The village of Bewdley sits on the west end of the lake and the town of Hastings sits on the east. Prehistoric burial mounds are found at Serpent Mounds Park on the north shore of the lake. Other places of interest include the Indian reserves of Alderville and Hiawatha. Other communities include Roseneath, Bailieboro, Gores Landing, Keene, Ontario and Harwood.

==Railway bridge==
The Cobourg and Peterborough Railway was completed in 1854 and crossed Rice Lake from Harwood to Hiawatha on a line of wooden trestles. However, the thick layers of ice that covered the lake in the winter damaged the bridge beyond repair and it was declared unsafe and closed within six years. Sections of the railway bed are still clearly visible on the south side of the lake. In the late 19th century, both before and after the railway bridge, steamboats provided both passenger and goods services, which could navigate up the Otonabee River as far as Peterborough.

==Tourism and fishing==
After the bridge failed, the Cobourg railway continued to run to Harwood. As well as lumber, the railway found a new use bringing iron ore from the Marmora quarries further east. These were brought by barge up the Trent and along Rice Lake, before being loaded on wagons and taken to the harbour at Cobourg. As Cobourg developed as a tourist town, the railway also brought recreational fishermen up to Rice Lake.

Rice Lake is now an attractive tourist area and is recognized for its recreational and sport fisheries. Rice Lake fish include panfish, walleye, muskellunge and bass. In addition in recreational fishing a number of annual fishing contests are held here.

An annual charity poker run boat race starting from Bewdley is held the first Saturday after Labour Day, with proceeds going to the Children&#x27;s Wish Foundation.

==Islands of Rice Lake==

Islands in the lake include: Coughlins Island, Cow Island, Black Island, Foley Island (Upper and Lower), Grasshopper Island, Grape Island (East and West), Harmony Island, Harris Island, Hickory Island, Long Island, Margaret Island, Muskrat Island, Paudaush Island, Rack Island, Scriver Island, Sheep Island, Spook Island, Sugar Island (East and West), Tic Island, and White&#x27;s Island.

The island is home to a large volcanic caldera on Mount Okmok and the only field of geysers in Alaska. It is separated from Unalaska Island by Umnak Pass. In 2000, Umnak was permanently inhabited by only 39 people and by 2010, around 18, placing the settlement of Nikolski in difficulty and its school was closed.

==History==
The earliest known settlement on Umnak Island is at Anangula and is 8,400 years old. Anangula was later abandoned and the Sandy Beach site became occupied, along with Idaliuk and Chaluka. Most of the early settlements on Umnak were located along the streams. A major geologic event was the cutting of strand flats during the Hypsithermal period, about 8250 to 3000 years ago, which led to a greater natural food supply on the island for the settlers.

Umnak Island was first reached by independent Russian fur traders in the 1750s. Abuses by the Russians led to an alliance among Aleuts in the Fox Islands. During the winter of 1761–1762, the crews of four Russian ships were massacred. This included one entire crew on Umnak which was completely wiped out. Russian traders responded with a scorched-earth campaign in 1764 that essentially ended the Aleuts&#x27; independence.

===Modern history===
The modern history of Umnak Island is linked to the military bases established by the United States during World War II. The purpose of the forward air bases in the Aleutian Islands was not only to defend the Dutch Harbor but also to launch attacks against the Japanese mainland.

On August 28, 1942, a USAAF B-17E bomber disappeared near Umnak Island, while returning from a bombing mission. The last radio contact from the crew stated that they had only one hour of fuel left. The entire crew of nine are officially listed as MIA, as no wreckage or remains were ever located.

The US Navy considered Umnak as exclusive and their own. They created a camouflage in the &quot;Blair Fish Packing Co,&quot; to build airports and bases to be used by the US Army Air Force during World War II. After getting clearance from General John L. DeWitt, Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. built airbases at Umnak (eventually known as Fort Glenn) and at Cold Bay. By the time the Japanese attacked in the summer of 1942, the US garrison at Umnak had a combined strength of 4000, including engineer companies complemented by infantry, as well as field and antiaircraft artillery units. The Japanese planned to attack and capture the island in June to maintain aerial patrols over North Pacific waters. Umnak was to be an outpost in a new area of dominance that would later include the Samoan and Fiji Islands and New Caledonia. The Japanese were unaware of the covert preparations being made by the United States as they believed that the island was only protected by a few ships operating in Aleutian waters.
==Geography and climate==

Umnak, the third largest of the Aleutian Islands after Unimak and Unalaska, lies in the Fox Islands of the Aleutian Islands of the Bering Sea, to the southwest of the larger island of Unalaska. It is approximately in length () and wide on average. The island was separated in the last glacial period and now lies about from North American shores. It is an active volcanic island, with a land area of and with a coastline extending over . The elevation of the island is . The island is very mountainous with a low level of vegetation. The island does not have a harbor, although a sizeable bay is located in the western part of the island and contains the Adugak Island. The southern point of the island is known as Cape Sagak.
The highest peak of the island, the Mount Vsevidof stratovolcano, is located in the southwestern part of the island. Its symmetrical cone rises abruptly from its surroundings and forms a crater at a height of . Its most recent eruption was caused by an earthquake on March 9, 1957. The mountain erupted on March 11, 1957, and the eruption ended the next day. To the east of Mount Vsevidof is the Russian Bay valley and another stratovolcano, Mount Recheshnoi which is also deeply dissected with a height of . In the southwest is the settlement of Nikolski further south and a lake, Umnak Lake, to its southeast which is just over in length. The ancient settlement of Chaluka is located between this lake and Nikolski. This area is known as the Samalga Pass and was the center of ancient activity on the island and is located about off the southwestern tip of the island (Cape Sagak).

The north-northeastern part of the island contains tholeiitic basaltic rocks and is characterized by tension faulting, lava flows, and fragmental deposits of igneous rocks. The volcano of Mount Okmok, characterized by its wide circular caldera, it located in the northwestern part of the island. This generally flat central basin has an average elevation of 370 m above sea level, with the rim of the caldera reaching a height of . Following the formation of the caldera, numerous satellite cones and lava domes have formed on the flanks of the volcano. They include Mount Tulik () on the caldera&#x27;s southeastern slope, Mount Idak () to the northeast, and Jag Peak. A crater lake once filled much of the caldera to a depth of over , but the lake ultimately drained through a notch eroded in the northeast rim. The prehistoric lake attained a maximum depth of about and the upper surface reached an elevation of about , at which point it overtopped the low point of the caldera rim. Small, shallow remnants of the lake remained north of Cone D at an altitude of about : a small shallow lake located between the caldera rim and Cone D; a smaller lake (named Cone B Lake) farther north near the caldera&#x27;s gate. After the 2008 eruption, the hydrogeology of the caldera was greatly changed with five separate sizable lakes now emplaced. In addition to the caldera lakes, Cone A, Cone E, and Cone G and the new 2008 vent on Cone D contain small crater lakes. The volcano is currently rated by the Alaska Volcano Observatory as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcanic-alert Level Normal.

To the north of Mount Recheshnoi, in the valley of Geyser Creek are located geothermal fields with geysers. In 1988 there were active 5 geysers up to 2 m high and 9 natural fountains up to 0.7 m high.

Umnak has a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc), which borders on a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfc) with short, mild to warm summers and long, cold, snowy winters.

==Eruptions==

On Saturday, July 12, 2008, Okmok Volcano on Mount Okmok, located on Umnak, erupted for several days, through a fresh vent sending wet, ash, and gas-rich plume that reached an altitude of in the air and forcing the evacuation of Fort Glenn, a private cattle ranch located on the island. Ash fell not only on the eastern part of the island but also on a fishing village on the northeast. However, the Aleut village, Nikolski, on the opposite side of Umnak Island with a population of about 40 people to the west of Okmok Volcano escaped from the southeasterly path of the ash clouds. The ash plume also disrupted the operation of flights to the Dutch Harbor airport as it spread across many miles of the North Pacific.

Okmok Caldera itself had been formed and reshaped in two major eruptions which occurred 12,000 and 2,000 years ago. Direct observations of later volcanic activity are known since 1805, with 16 eruptions recorded every 10 to 20 years. The 1817 eruption deposited several feet of ash and &quot;scoria&quot; rock debris on the northeastern caldera rim, with ash falling on Unalaska Island. Floods that occurred during this destroyed an Aleut village at Cape Tanak on the northeast Bering Sea Coast of the island. In the recent 1997 eruption, the ash clouds traveled across the volcano&#x27;s caldera floor.

==Demographics==

In 1941, when the island was being used as a military base by the United States, the population of the province consisted of only 50 Aleutians. , the island&#x27;s population further declined to 39 persons. Its only remaining community, Nikolski, comprised the island&#x27;s entire population. Fort Glenn, a former major military facility on the northeast shore of the island, played an instrumental role in the North Pacific Theater in World War II.

, there were 15 households and 12 families residing on the island. The population density was . There were 28 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of was 30.77% White and 69.23% Native American.

There were 15 households, out of which 40.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were married couples living together, 20.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.0% were non-families. 20.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 2.92.

In 2000, the median age was 40 years, with 35.9% under the age of 18, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 10.3% who were 65 years of age or older. For every 100 females there were 105.3 males. For every 100 females of age 18 and over, there were 92.3 males.

The median income for a household was $38,750, and the median income for a family was $40,250. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $11,875 for females. The per capita income was $14,083. There were 23.5% of families and 20.7% of the population living below the poverty line, including 13.6% of under eighteens and 55.6% of those over 64.

==Education==
The only school on the island was in Nikolski, part of the Aleutian Region Schools. The Nikolski School served grades K-12. The school had one teacher who lived in a small home adjacent to the school building. The home is owned by the school district and was purpose-built for teachers and their families. The Nikolski School is in danger of extinction. Schools in rural Alaska must have at least 10 students to retain funding from the state. For the 2009–2010 school year, the Nikolski School had only nine students including a Samoan family who subsequently relocated, and was closed in 2010.

==Transport==

Umnak does not have a harbor. It does, however, have an airstrip, Nikolski Airport. Building an airport runway in the hilly terrain was a unique engineering achievement of the Army Engineers, commanded by Colonel Benjamin B. Talley. The construction work of the runway was proposed at Otter Point on the northeastern end of Umnak. Construction was started in the middle of January 1942 and was commissioned by April of the same year, being given the name Fort Glenn. of Marston Matting, a perforated-steel plating (PSP), was assembled along with other steel plates and created a flat surface for aircraft to take off and land. The runway was completed on March 31, 1942, by the 807th Unit of the Army Engineers. It was long with a width of sufficient for Capt. John S. Chennault&#x27;s P-40 fighter aircraft in the 11th Fighter Squadron to land.

The Naval Air Facility Otter Point was built next to Fort Glenn.

After the war ended, Fort Glenn remained open as a refueling stop for transient aircraft in the Aleutians along with Military Air Transport Service flights using the Great Circle Route from Japan to the United States. The main runway was extended to 8,300 feet long to accommodate large, long-range aircraft. By 1946, the base maintained only a skeleton staff due to the rapid demobilization of the Army Air Forces. The last AAF personnel were withdrawn by 30 September 1947, and the base was put on inactive status and was effectively abandoned. It was decommissioned in 1950 and the site was excessed between 1952–55 to the Bureau of Land Management. Many years later the airfield was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Cape Field at Fort Glenn. Some distance away, Nikolski is still served by a gravel airstrip.

<text>Rannoch ( or , meaning &#x27;bracken&#x27;) is an area of the Scottish Highlands between the A9 road, to the east, and the A82, to the west. The area is crossed from south to north by the West Highland railway line.

Features of the area include Loch Rannoch and Rannoch Moor. The loch is in the northwest of the council area of Perth and Kinross. The moor extends further west, into the south of the Highland council area.

The moor is partly within the catchment basin of the loch. The loch itself drains to the east, via the River Tummel into the River Tay.

The railway links Rannoch station and Corrour station with Fort William in the north and Glasgow in the south. Via the north bank of Loch Rannoch the B846 road links Rannoch station with the A9 between Pitlochry and Blair Atholl. Corrour station is remote from any public road.

The village of Kinloch Rannoch is on the B846 at the eastern (River Tummel) end of the loch.

<text>A smoke screen is smoke released to mask the movement or location of military units such as infantry, tanks, aircraft, or ships.

Smoke screens are commonly deployed either by a (such as a grenade) or generated by a vehicle (such as a tank or a warship).

Whereas smoke screens were originally used to hide movement from enemies&#x27; line of sight, modern technology means that they are now also available in new forms; they can screen in the infrared as well as visible spectrum of light to prevent detection by infrared sensors or viewers, and they are also available for vehicles in a super-dense form used to block laser beams of enemy laser designators or rangefinders.

==Technology==
===Smoke grenades===
These are canister-type grenades used as a ground-to-ground or ground-to-air signalling device. The body consists of a steel sheet metal cylinder with a few emission holes on the top and/or bottom to allow smoke release when the smoke composition inside the grenade is ignited. In those that produce colored smoke, the filler consists of 250 to 350 grams of colored (red, green, yellow or violet) smoke mixture (mostly potassium chlorate, sodium bicarbonate, lactose and a dye). In those that produce screening smoke, the filler usually consists of HC smoke mixture (hexachloroethane/zinc) or TA smoke mixture (terephthalic acid). Another type of smoke grenade is filled with white phosphorus (WP), which is spread by explosive action. The phosphorus catches fire in the presence of air, and burns with a brilliant yellow flame, while producing copious amounts of white smoke (phosphorus pentoxide). WP grenades double as incendiary grenades.

===Smoke shell===

Artillery and mortars can also fire smoke generating munitions, and are the main means of generating tactical smokescreens on land. As with grenades, artillery shells are available as both emission type smoke shell, and bursting smoke shell. Mortars nearly always use bursting smoke rounds because of the smaller size of mortar bombs and the greater efficiency of bursting rounds.

===Smoke generators===
Very large or sustained smoke screens are produced by a smoke generator. This machine heats a volatile material (typically oil or an oil based mixture) to evaporate it, then mixes the vapor with cool external air at a controlled rate so it condenses to a mist with a controlled droplet size. Cruder designs simply boiled waste oil over a heater, while more sophisticated ones sprayed a specially formulated oily composition (&quot;fog oil&quot;) through nozzles onto a heated plate. Choice of a suitable oil, and careful control of cooling rate, can produce droplet sizes close to the ideal size for Mie scattering of visible light. This produces a very effective obscuration per weight of material used. This screen can then be sustained as long as the generator is supplied with oil, and—especially if a number of generators are used—the screen can build up to a considerable size. One 50 gallon drum of fog oil can obscure of land in 15 minutes.

Whilst producing very large amounts of smoke relatively cheaply, these generators have a number of disadvantages. They are much slower to respond than pyrotechnic sources, and require a valuable piece of equipment to be sited at the point of emission of the smoke. They are also relatively heavy and not readily portable, which is a significant problem if the wind shifts. To overcome this latter problem, they may be used in fixed posts widely dispersed over the battlefield, or else mounted on specially adapted vehicles. An example of the latter is the M56 Coyote generator.

Many armoured fighting vehicles can create smoke screens in a similar way, generally by injecting diesel fuel onto the hot exhaust.

===Naval methods===

Warships have sometimes used a simple variation of the smoke generator, by injecting fuel oil directly into the funnel, where it evaporates into a white cloud. An even simpler method that was used in the days of steam-propelled warships was to restrict the supply of air to the boiler. This resulted in incomplete combustion of the coal or oil, which produced a thick black smoke. Because the smoke was black, it absorbed heat from the sun and tended to rise above the water. Therefore, navies turned to various chemicals, such as titanium tetrachloride, that produce a white, low-lying cloud.

==Infrared smokes==
The proliferation of thermal imaging FLIR systems on the battlefields necessitates the use of obscurant smokes that are effectively opaque in the infrared part of electromagnetic spectrum. This kind of obscurant smoke is sometimes referred to as &quot;Visual and Infrared Screening Smoke&quot; (VIRSS). To achieve this, the particle size and composition of the smokes has to be adjusted. One of the approaches is using an aerosol of burning red phosphorus particles and aluminium-coated glass fibers; the infrared emissions of such smoke curtains hides the weaker emissions of colder objects behind it, but the effect is only short-lived. Carbon (most often graphite) particles present in the smokes can also serve to absorb the beams of laser designators. Yet another possibility is a water fog sprayed around the vehicle; the presence of large droplets absorbs in infrared band and additionally serves as a countermeasure against radars in 94 GHz band. Other materials used as visible/infrared obscurants are micro-pulverized flakes of brass or graphite, particles of titanium dioxide, or terephthalic acid.

Older systems for production of infrared smoke work as generators of aerosol of dust with controlled particle size. Most contemporary vehicle-mounted systems use this approach. However, the aerosol stays airborne only for a short time.

The brass particles used in some infrared smoke grenades are typically composed of 70% copper and 30% zinc. They are shaped as irregular flakes with a diameter of about 1.7 μm and thickness of 80–320 nm.

Some experimental obscurants work in both infrared and millimeter wave region. They include carbon fibers, metal coated fibers or glass particles, metal microwires, particles of iron and of suitable polymers.

==Chemicals used==
===Zinc chloride===
Zinc chloride smoke is grey-white and consists of tiny particles of zinc chloride. The most common mixture for generating these is a zinc chloride smoke mixture (HC), consisting of hexachloroethane, grained aluminium and zinc oxide. The smoke consists of zinc chloride, zinc oxychlorides, and hydrochloric acid, which absorb the moisture in the air. The smoke also contains traces of organic chlorinated compounds, phosgene, carbon monoxide, and chlorine.

Its toxicity is caused mainly by the content of strongly acidic hydrochloric acid, but also due to thermal effects of reaction of zinc chloride with water. These effects cause lesions of the mucous membranes of the upper airways. Damage of the lower airways can manifest itself later as well, due to fine particles of zinc chloride and traces of phosgene. In high concentrations the smoke can be very dangerous when inhaled. Symptoms include dyspnea, retrosternal pain, hoarseness, stridor, lachrymation, cough, expectoration, and in some cases haemoptysis. Delayed pulmonary edema, cyanosis or bronchopneumonia may develop. The smoke and the spent canisters contain suspected carcinogens.

The prognosis for the casualties depends on the degree of the pulmonary damage. All exposed individuals should be kept under observation for 8 hours. Most affected individuals recover within several days, with some symptoms persisting for up to 1–2 weeks. Severe cases can suffer of reduced pulmonary function for some months, the worst cases developing marked dyspnoea and cyanosis leading to death.

Respirators are required for people coming into contact with the zinc chloride smoke.

===Chlorosulfuric acid===
Chlorosulfuric acid (CSA) is a heavy, strongly acidic liquid. When dispensed in air, it readily absorbs moisture and forms dense white fog of hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. In moderate concentrations it is highly irritating to eyes, nose, and skin.

When chlorosulfuric acid comes in contact with water, a strong exothermic reaction scatters the corrosive mixture in all directions. CSA is highly corrosive, so careful handling is required.

Low concentrations cause prickling sensations on the skin, but high concentrations or prolonged exposure to field concentrations can cause severe irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract, and mild cough and moderate contact dermatitis can result. Liquid CSA causes acid burns of skin and exposure of eyes can lead to severe eye damage.

Affected body parts should be washed with water and then with sodium bicarbonate solution. The burns are then treated like thermal burns. The skin burns heal readily, while cornea burns can result in residual scarring.

Respirators are required for any concentrations sufficient to cause any coughing, irritation of the eyes or prickling of the skin.

===Titanium tetrachloride===
Titanium tetrachloride (FM) is a colorless, non-flammable, corrosive liquid. In contact with damp air it hydrolyzes readily, resulting in a dense white smoke consisting of droplets of hydrochloric acid and particles of titanium oxychloride.

The titanium tetrachloride smoke is an irritant and unpleasant to breathe.

It is dispensed from aircraft to create vertical smoke curtains, and during World War II it was a favorite smoke generation agent on warships.

Goggles and a respirator should be worn when in contact with the smoke, full protective clothing should be worn when handling liquid FM. In direct contact with skin or eyes, liquid FM causes acid burns.

===Phosphorus===

Red phosphorus and white phosphorus (WP) are red or waxy yellow or white substances. White phosphorus is pyrophoric - can be handled safely when under water, but in contact with air it spontaneously ignites. It is used as an incendiary. Both types of phosphorus are used for smoke generation, mostly in artillery shells, bombs, and grenades. 

White phosphorus smoke is typically very hot and may cause burns on contact. Red phosphorus is less reactive, does not ignite spontaneously, and its smoke does not cause thermal burns - for this reason it is safer to handle, but cannot be used so easily as an incendiary.

Aerosol of burning phosphorus particles is an effective obscurant against thermal imaging systems. However, this effect is short-lived. After the phosphorus particles fully burn, the smoke reverts from emission to absorption. While very effective in the visible spectrum, cool phosphorus smoke has only low absorption and scattering in infrared wavelengths. Additives in the smoke that involve this part of the spectrum may be visible to thermal imagers or IR viewers.

===Dyes===
Various signalling purposes require the use of colored smoke. The smoke created is a fine mist of dye particles, generated by burning a mixture of one or more dyes with a low-temperature pyrotechnic composition, usually based on potassium chlorate and lactose (also known as milk sugar).

Colored smoke screen is also possible by adding a colored dye into the fog oil mixture. Typical white smoke screen uses titanium dioxide (or other white pigment), but other colors are possible by replacing titanium dioxide with another pigment. When the hot fog oil condenses on contact with air, the pigment particles are suspended along with the oil vapor. Early smoke screen experiments attempted the use of colored pigment, but found that titanium dioxide was the most light scattering particle known and therefore best for use in obscuring troops and naval vessels. Colored smoke became primarily used for signaling rather than obscuring. In today&#x27;s military, smoke grenades are found to be non-cancer causing, unlike the 1950s AN-M8 model.

===Sulfonic acid===
The smoke generator on the Medium Mark B tank used sulfonic acid.

==Tactics==
===History===
The first documented use of a smoke screen was circa 2000 B.C. in the wars of ancient India, where incendiary devices and toxic fumes caused people to fall asleep.

It was later recorded by a Greek historian, Thucydides, who described that the smoke created by the burning of sulphur, wood and pitch was carried by the wind into Plataea (428 B.C.) and later at Delium (423 B.C.) and that at Delium, defenders were driven from the city walls.

In 1622, a smoke screen was used at the Battle of Macau by the Dutch. A barrel of damp gunpowder was fired into the wind so that the Dutch could land under the cover of smoke.

Later, between 1790 and 1810, Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775–1860), a Scottish Naval commander and officer in the Royal Navy who fought during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, devised a smoke screen created through the burning of sulphur which would be used in warfare after learning about the same methods used at Delium and Plataea.

Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald&#x27;s grandson, Douglas Cochrane, 12th Earl of Dundonald, described in his autobiography how he spoke to Winston Churchill (who once galloped for him when he had a brigade at manœuvres in England) of the importance of using smoke-screens on the battleground, it would in turn be used in both WWI &amp; WW2.

===Land warfare===

Smoke screens are usually used by infantry to conceal their movement in areas of enemy fire. They can also be used by armoured fighting vehicles, such as tanks, to conceal a withdrawal. They have regularly been used since earliest times to disorient or drive off attackers.

During the First World War the Germans used a lot of smoke screens (&quot;Nebel&quot;) to hide Batterie Pommern.

A toxic variant of the smokescreen was used and devised by Frank Arthur Brock who used it during the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918, the British Royal Navy&#x27;s attempt to neutralize the key Belgian port of Bruges-Zeebrugge.

For the crossing of the Dnieper river in October 1943, the Red Army laid a smoke screen long. At the Anzio beachhead in 1944, US Chemical Corps troops maintained a &quot;light haze&quot; smokescreen around the harbour throughout daylight hours, for two months. The density of this screen was adjusted to be sufficient to prevent observation by German forward observers in the surrounding hills, yet not inhibit port operations.

In the Vietnam War, &quot;Smoke Ships&quot; were introduced as part of a new Air Mobile Concept to protect crew and man on the ground from small arms fire. In 1964 and 1965, the &quot;Smoke Ship&quot; was first employed by the 145th Combat Aviation Battalion using the UH-1B.

===Naval warfare===

There are a number of early examples of using incendiary weapons at sea, such as Greek fire, stinkpots, fire ships, and incendiaries on the decks of turtle ships, which also had the effect of creating smoke. The naval smoke screen is often said to have been proposed by Sir Thomas Cochrane in 1812, although Cochrane&#x27;s proposal was as much an asphyxiant as an obscurant. It is not until the early twentieth century that there is clear evidence of deliberate use of large scale naval smokescreens as a major tactic.

During the American Civil War, the first smoke screen was used by the &quot;R.E. Lee&quot;, running the blockade and escaping the .

The use of smoke screens was common in the naval battles of World War I and World War II.

<text>TOPSHOP (originally Top Shop) is a British fast-fashion company, which specialises in women&#x27;s clothing, shoes and accessories. It was part of the Arcadia Group, controlled by Sir Philip Green, but went into administration in late 2020 before being purchased by ASOS on 1 February 2021. It now operates via the ASOS website and app, as well as being sold in Nordstrom stores in the US on Nordstrom.com. TOPSHOP previously had around 510 shops worldwide.

In 2024, ASOS sold 75% of Topshop and Topman to Danish company Bestseller.

==History==

Topshop started as a brand extension of the department store Peter Robinson in the 1960s and originally sold fashion by young British designers, such as Mary Quant and Stirling Cooper. Peter Robinson was a women&#x27;s fashion chain that had been acquired by Burton in 1946. Topshop was founded in 1964 as Peter Robinson&#x27;s Top Shop, a youth brand within the Sheffield branch and also had a large department in the Oxford Street shop. This was high fashion for the &quot;young and different generation&quot; as &quot;The Times&quot; put it in 1965, and the department stocked garments by names such as Mary Quant and Gerald McCann. By 1966, it had a branch in the Peter Robinson store in Norwich.

Peter Robinson&#x27;s Top Shop buyer Diane Wadey had an eye for young talent and introduced Royal College of Art graduate Jane Whiteside to Jeff Cooper and Ronnie Stirling. The Stirling Cooper brand they created soon had its own sections in Top Shop shops in London and Sheffield, as well as being stocked in Peter Robinson stores in Norwich and Bristol. Other brands stocked at Top Shop included Jeff Banks, French Connection and Radley Cooper.

===Launch of separate retail chain===
In 1973, parent company Burton Group launched a major expansion of its womenswear division, splitting Top Shop by Peter Robinson into two chains to be known as Peter Robinson and Top Shop. It was announced that while Peter Robinson would target the over 25s market, Top Shop would focus on the age range from 13 to 24, with Ralph Halpern directing the new venture. By 1974, Peter Robinson had been reduced from 22 stores to six, while Top Shop was developing independently (still retaining the one co-branded shop in Oxford Street) and was described as &quot;highly profitable&quot;. Its key retail rivals included Miss Selfridge and the Way In boutique arm of Harrods. Within two years, Top Shop had 55 standalone branches, with more to come according to an article in &quot;The Times&quot;. Fashion editor Prudence Glynn described it as having a: &quot;sharp definition of purpose&quot;. It made profits of £1m that year. By 1978, Top Shop accounted for a third of Burton&#x27;s operating profits.

Also in 1978, Burton embarked on a drive to win a larger share of the men&#x27;s fashion market in the midst of declining sales of men&#x27;s tailoring, launching the Topman brand along similar lines to its women&#x27;s retail arm. It was described by an executive as: &quot;more of a &#x27;brother to Top Shop than a son of Burton&#x27;.&quot; The following year, Burton announced sales and profits up by 30 per cent in womenswear, with Topman also being cited as highly profitable. By the start of the 1980s, the brand was being referred to as Topshop.

===1980s and beyond===
In the 1980s, Topshop struggled to maintain its profile as a fashion brand, but by the late 1990s it began undergoing a revival. The brand pioneered online fashion, launching UK&#x27;s first online fashion store for Topshop This turnaround is often credited to the promotion of Jane Shepherdson as brand director. Having begun her career as a buyer, she rose through the ranks at the company. When she took on brand direction, Topshop had an annual profit of £9 million; by 2005 it was making over £100 million annually.
Under her tenure, Topshop became a key sponsor of London Fashion Week, sponsoring its Newgen arm that supports emerging British designers from 2002 and the Fashion East initiative – which acts as a bridge between London&#x27;s fashion colleges and the Newgen scheme – a year later. This sponsorship continues and since 2005 it has been part of the London Fashion Week catwalk schedule.

In December 2012, Philip Green sold a 25% stake in Topshop and Topman to the US-based private equity group Leonard Green and Partners for US$805 million. Under the terms of the deal, Arcadia retained Topshop&#x27;s flagship Oxford Street shop (said to be worth between £400 and £500 million). Green said that the deal would enable Topshop to speed up its expansion, particularly within the US.

In 2015, Topshop started collaborating with the online retailer Zalando and began selling their merchandise in their shops. Advertisements featuring model Cara Delevingne were broadcast in Germany, Switzerland and France.

===Designer collections===
Topshop has been among the UK chain shops to work with high-fashion brands on capsule collections. In 1994, it launched a collection with Red or Dead. It continued to work with designer talent, such as former Clements Ribeiro assistant Markus Lupfer – described in 1999 as &quot;so hot he&#x27;s practically steaming&quot; – also working with, among others, Hussein Chalayan, Tristan Webber and Tracey Boyd. Typically, such ranges sold out quickly, and attracted column inches in the fashion press.

In May 2007, British supermodel Kate Moss, designed her first collection for the brand. The appointment of Moss was announced just before the departure of Shepherdson for Whistles. In the same year, artist Stella Vine designed a limited edition range inspired by her artworks. These included T-shirts, vest tops, and T-shirt dresses, with the labels designed in pink glitter. &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that &quot;the fact that the range of T-shirts she has recently designed for TopShop – emblazoned with slogans like Breaking Up With Her Boyfriend – are flying out, speaks volumes for her public support.&quot;

In 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear brand with Topshop. The 50-50 venture was initially called Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd and was scheduled to launch its first dance, fitness and sports ranges in autumn 2015. In November 2015, it was revealed that the brand would launch in April 2016. The brand was later revealed to be called Ivy Park.

===Administration===
Arcadia Group went into administration at 8pm GMT on 30 November 2020. On 25 January 2021, ASOS said it was in &quot;exclusive&quot; talks to buy Arcadia&#x27;s Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration, though it only wanted the brands, not the shops. A consortium including Next had earlier dropped a bid to buy Topshop and Topman; interest in Arcadia operations had also been expressed by Mike Ashley&#x27;s Frasers Group, a consortium including JD Sports, and online retailer Boohoo.

On 1 February 2021, ASOS announced it had acquired the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration for £265 million, paying an additional £65 million for current and pre-ordered stock. ASOS will keep 300 employees on as part of the deal but will not keep any of the brand&#x27;s stores, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. In July 2021, it was announced that Nordstrom had acquired an unspecified minority stake in the Topshop Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT businesses from ASOS, with the intention of selling the brands online and instore across North America.

On 5 September 2024, ASOS announced that it sold a 75% stake of Topshop &amp; Topman to the Danish company Bestseller. It was announced that the Topshop &amp; Topman websites would relaunch within 6 months of the deal with Bestseller, as well it was hinted that the brands could return to the high street with stores, the chief executive of ASOS commented &quot;We might open stores. We will consider it for sure but we have no specific agreement to open a certain number&quot;.

==International operations and franchises==
Topshop had around 510 shops including those that are franchised; over 300 shops were located in the UK. It had operated across 37 countries and via online operations in several markets.
Topshop began planning its expansion to the United States in the mid-2000s and was tipped to open in New York as early as 2007. Currently it operates via a website and sells in Nordstrom shops. A small number of wholly owned shops were located in major cities. On 5 November 2014 it opened a flagship shop in New York City, located on Fifth Avenue. The shop was the largest international site, and second only to the Oxford Street, London shop in square footage. This was its second shop in New York City, the first having opened on Broadway in 2009. On 23 May 2019, Arcadia filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the United States and announced that all 11 US freestanding Topshop stores would be liquidated and closed; however, Topshop would continue to sell its merchandise exclusively at Nordstrom locations.

Topshop announced a five-year international expansion plan in early 2011, planning to open new shops across Asia, Australia and the US as well as seeking opportunities in Europe. Although the Japanese flagship shops launched in 2006, all 5 shops in Japan shut in 2015. In 2013, parent group Arcadia began stepping up its franchise deals, announcing a planned 150 new shop openings with partners in Canada, Australia and Vietnam, to include Topshop and Topman shops.

In November 2012, Topshop launched its first shop in South Africa. In April 2013 a Topshop-Topman shop launched in Cape Town, at the V&amp;A Waterfront. On 24 October 2013, Topshop opened a concession at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, its first outlet in France.

===Discontinued international operations===
Topshop expanded into Australia in 2011, with shops in New South Wales and Victoria. In 2013 it opened a shop in Brisbane&#x27;s CBD in a location previously occupied by Borders. However, in mid-2017 Topshop&#x27;s Australian operations went into voluntary administration. By mid 2019, only Sydney&#x27;s Market Street store remained opened, after the closure of stores at Westfield Bondi Junction and Melbourne&#x27;s Emporium earlier in the year. In March 2020 Topshop closed its final Australian store, 11 years after its initial launch.

In 2015, Topshop opened a flagship shop in Auckland and 10 months later a shop in Wellington. The company has had a presence in New Zealand since 2010, opening a small concession within a department store in 2010. Located on Auckland&#x27;s Queen Street, the flagship shop sold out of some of its ranges before it had opened. In September 2017, the franchise went into receivership and both shops closed on 28 September 2017.

Topshop had originally expanded into Singapore since 2000 with the outlet opening at Orchard Road. On 17 September 2020, all stores were eventually closed down citing losses, before the acquisition by ASOS in February 2021.

Many of the stores are closed worldwide due to the acquisition by ASOS such as Israel, Philippines, Hong Kong, Egypt, Indonesia, Netherlands, Singapore, Thailand and United Kingdom. Other areas that are likely to close down will be Malaysia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.
===UK flagship stores===

*Oxford Circus, London – The flagship Topshop shop in the UK was , covered five floors and attracted an average of 28,000 customers each day. In May 2019, Arcadia Group confirmed it planned to close multiple stores, including Topshop&#x27;s flagship store on London&#x27;s Oxford Street.

* Victoria Square, Belfast – In 2008 Topshop Victoria Square, Belfast opened its doors as one of the largest shops in the new shopping centre development at ; the largest Topshop in Northern Ireland.

==Protests and controversy==
Topshop has been criticised for its overseas sourcing policies and its tax arrangements. In December 2007, the Edinburgh branch was targeted by student campaigning network People &amp; Planet for allegedly using cotton picked by &quot;slave labour&quot;.

In December 2010, some 200 campaigners staged a sit-in that closed Topshop&#x27;s Oxford Circus shop, and in Brighton a number of protestors glued themselves to the branch windows. Other high streets in towns and cities across Britain saw similar protests in a day of action by UK Uncut against corporate tax arrangements. Two months later, police arrested a man for writing &quot;pay your taxes&quot; in washable ink on the wall of a Topshop branch in Colchester.

In July 2013, the singer Rihanna won a lawsuit against Topshop to prevent it using her image unofficially on a T-shirt. The lawsuit was launched on the premise that Topshop customers would assume Rihanna endorsed the company, that would lead to a false representation of her celebrity image and increased tensions with her then endorsement deal with River Island, a high-street rival. Judge Justice Birss agreed that customers would likely be deceived into believing it had the singer&#x27;s approval. Topshop launched an appeal to the High Court, accusing Rihanna of wrongfully advocating that: &quot;only a celebrity may ever market his or her own character&quot; and Judge Justice Birss of misreading the law on &quot;celebrity merchandising&quot;. The appeal was rejected unanimously at the Court of Appeal in London on 22 January 2015

In July 2015, Topshop has been criticised for its mannequins which some judged as too skinny. After a customer complained on Facebook, the fashion chain stopped using its tall and skinny female shop mannequins. It&#x27;s also been criticised in October 2018 for removing an in-store pop-up in its London flagship store that was used to promote feminism with publisher Penguin after only being up for 20 minutes. The fashion retailer had agreed to host the pop-up with Penguin, to help launch the book Feminists Don&#x27;t Wear Pink (And Other Lies), written by Scarlett Curtis, with products for sale supporting the UN charity Girl Up. 

In May 2016, the UVW union organised a large protest outside Topshop&#x27;s Oxford Circus store attended by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP. It was the headlining event in a national &quot;day of action&quot; involving 16 other Topshop stores around the country, supported by various trade unions and activist groups, calling for the Living Wage and dignified treatment of outsourced cleaners being victimised for trade union activity. Two weeks earlier, an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons supported by 11 MPs noted:&quot;that contract cleaners employed at Topshop stores by the contractor Britannia Services Group are paid below the living wage, forcing hard-working staff into debt and poverty; believes that there is no excuse for profitable multi-national companies which provide huge payouts to shareholders refusing to pay decent wages; fully supports cleaners contracted to work at Topshop stores who are unionising, protesting and campaigning for the living wage; is extremely concerned by reports that these staff are being victimised and bullied for asking for a decent wage; further believes that it is utterly disgraceful for the Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop, or its contractors to punish staff for asking for decent wages&quot;

<text>A natural key (also known as business key or domain key) is a type of unique key in a database formed of attributes that exist and are used in the external world outside the database (i.e. in the business domain or domain of discourse). In the relational model of data, a natural key is a superkey and is therefore a functional determinant for all attributes in a relation.

A natural key serves two complementary purposes: 
* It provides a means of unique identification for data
* It imposes a rule, specifically a uniqueness constraint, to ensure that data remains unique within an information system
The uniqueness constraint assures uniqueness of data within a certain technical context (e.g. a set of values in a table, file or relation variable) by rejecting input of any data that would otherwise violate the constraint. This means that the user can rely on a guaranteed correspondence between facts identified by key values recorded in a system and the external domain of discourse (a single version of the truth according to Kimball).

A natural key differs from a surrogate key which has no meaning outside the database itself and is not based on real-world observation or intended as a statement about the reality being modelled. A natural key therefore provides a certain data quality guarantee whereas a surrogate does not. It is common for elements of data to have several keys, any number of which may be natural or surrogate.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of using a natural key to uniquely identify records in a relation include less disk space usage, the natural key is an attribute that is related to the business or the real world so in most cases, it is already being stored in the relation which saves disk space as compared to creating a new column for storing the surrogate key.

Another advantage of using natural keys is that it simplifies enforcement of data quality, and they are easier to relate to real life while designing the database system. They simplify the quality of data as using a natural key that is unique in the real world ensures that there cannot be multiple records with the same primary key. Comparing the database schema to a real world scenario is a huge part of designing a database schema and when a natural key is being used in the tables of the database, it makes it easy for the database engineer to engineer the database system.

== Disadvantages ==
Usage of natural keys as unique identifiers in a table has one main disadvantage which is the change of business rules or the change of rules of the attribute in the real world. The definition of the structure of the natural key attribute might change in the future.

For example if there is a table storing the information about US citizens, the Social Security Number would act as the natural key, Social Security Number being the natural key might pose a problem in the future if the US government changes the structure of the Social Security Number and increases the number of digits in the SSN due to some reason. In that case, the database administrator will have to change the schema of the table and perhaps also update the records of the table. In other cases, this can prevent improvements of the system altogether due to too extensive effort required for the change, e.g., the inability of the knowledge management software Confluence, to represent multiple pages with the same title.

<doc id="949156" wikidata="Q5156838" url="?curid=949156" title="Composite key">
<text>In database design, a composite key is a candidate key that consists of two or more attributes, (table columns) that together uniquely identify an entity occurrence (table row). 

A compound key is a composite key for which each attribute that makes up the key is a foreign key in its own right.

== Advantages ==
Composite keys have advantages similar to that of a natural key as it is often composed of multiple natural key attributes.
=== Storage ===
Composite keys use less disk space as compared to defining a surrogate key column, this is because the composite key already exists as attributes in the table and does not need to be defined in the table just for the purpose of unique identification. This simplifies the table and also saves space.

=== Easier to implement and use ===
Composite keys are easy to implement in a database schema as their component parts are already named items in the database. When they are also natural keys, they are often intuitive for real world scenarios. They are often used when a non-composite key does not always uniquely identify a record. For example, a personal name may often, but not always, be unique in a given database, and some other field such as date of birth may be added to make uniqueness much more probable.

== Disadvantages ==
=== Requirement changes ===
The business requirements and rules can change which can change the format of certain real world entities. Composite keys are formed of multiple natural keys which are related to the real world and with the change of their format in the real world, their format in the database will also be changed. This is inconvenient as the number of attributes of composite key will change and all the foreign keys would need to be updated.
=== Complexity and storage ===
A composite key consists of multiple attributes and the composite key will be referenced in multiple tables as the foreign key, this uses a lot of disk space as multiple columns are being stored as the foreign key instead of just possibly one. This makes the schema complex and the queries become more CPU expensive as for every join the DBMS will need to compare three attributes instead of just possibly one in case of a single natural key.

== Example ==
An example is an entity that represents the modules each student is attending at University. The entity has a and a as its primary key. Each of the attributes that makes up the primary key is a simple key because each represents a unique reference when identifying a student in one instance and a module in the other, so this key is a compound key.

In contrast, using the same example, imagine we identified a student by their + (assuming that people must have different names). In a table representing students our primary key would now be + . Because students can have the same or the same these attributes are not simple keys. The primary key + for students is a composite key.

<text>Bishop&#x27;s Bridge, sometimes known as Paddington Bridge, is a road bridge in the Paddington district of London which carries Bishop&#x27;s Bridge Road across the rail approaches to Paddington station and across the adjacent Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal. The original Isambard Kingdom Brunel built bridge was replaced in 2006. The name Bishop&#x27;s Bridge Road comes from the manor of Paddington which was granted to the Bishop of London, Nicholas Ridley, by Edward VI in the mid 16th Century.

== Brunel&#x27;s first iron bridge ==

In 2003 while researching a book about the station, Steven Brindle, Inspector of Ancient Monuments for English Heritage (London region), discovered that Isambard Kingdom Brunel was responsible for the original Bishop&#x27;s Bridge, and that the section he built over the canal was his first iron bridge and had a unique design. The bulb-headed cast iron girders used in this bridge would have an influence on the much longer wrought iron girders he would later develop in his balloon flange pattern.

Unaware that they were intending to replace the bridge, by the time Brindle contacted Westminster City Council, their planning of the replacement project was at an advanced stage, with the main contract due to be signed the following week, and demolition due to take place 10 months later.

Investigations determined that the canal section of Brunel&#x27;s 1839 bridge had survived, as rebuilding work in 1906 had merely obscured it and caused it to be forgotten. Negotiations between the council and English Heritage followed, and it was agreed that the 1839 iron bridge would be dismantled with a view to future reconstruction. The bulk of the dismantling work took place in April 2004, allowing the bridge replacement work to proceed as planned.

An application for planning permission to reconstruct the original iron bridge along the canal was submitted in April 2006. However, this has lapsed, and the dismantled bridge remains in storage in the care of Historic England at Fort Cumberland, near Portsmouth.

Construction on the replacement bridge by Hochtief commenced in July 2003 with it opening on 14 June 2006.

<doc id="949160" wikidata="Q1782850" url="?curid=949160" title="Val Gielgud">
<text>Val Henry Gielgud CBE (28 April 1900 – 30 November 1981) was an English actor, writer, director and broadcaster. He was a pioneer of radio drama for the BBC, and also directed the first ever drama to be produced in the newer medium of television.

Val Gielgud was born in London, into a theatrical family, being the brother of Sir John Gielgud (who acted in several of his productions) and a great-nephew of the Victorian actress Dame Ellen Terry.

==BBC radio==
Following education at Oxford University, Gielgud began his career as a secretary to a member of parliament, before moving into writing when he took a job as the sub-editor of a comic book / magazine. It was this job that led him to work for the BBC&#x27;s own listings magazine, the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, as the assistant to the editor Eric Maschwitz. This was Gielgud&#x27;s first connection to the corporation, and although he was not yet involved in any radio production, he often used his position at the magazine to make his thoughts on radio dramas felt: in his autobiography, he later confessed to having written several of the letters appearing on the magazine&#x27;s correspondence page, supposedly from listeners, criticising various aspects of the corporation&#x27;s drama productions.

Maschwitz and Gielgud were close friends, and even wrote detective fiction together – Gielgud would later on go on to be responsible in whole or part for twenty-six detective / mystery novels, one short story collection, two historical novels, nineteen stage plays, four film screenplays, forty radio plays, seven non-fiction books and be the editor of a further two books.

In January 1929, Gielgud was appointed Head of Productions at the BBC, responsible for all radio drama, when he had never previously directed a single radio play. He succeeded R. E. Jeffrey, whose output he had been so regularly criticising in his abuse of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; letters page. He proved to be highly successful in this role, remaining in it for the next twenty years and overseeing all of the radio drama produced during the period, writing many plays himself and worked as an actor in small parts in six of them.

Gielgud is often praised with inventing many of the techniques of radio drama still common in the form today. He constantly reminded those working with and under him that radio drama could employ vastly larger casts and place itself in more exotic settings than was possible with regular stage plays, and held a theory that while stage plays could show the actions of characters, in radio it was possible to get inside their minds.

He was not an advocate of the soap opera genre – which was rising to prominence on radio in the United States at the time – instead, he preferred to concentrate on producing a variety of one-off dramas, rather than continuing series. He was not averse to producing the popular as well as the cultural though, with various mysteries and thrillers being broadcast as well as classical productions of Shakespeare plays among others.

==BBC television==
In July 1930, Gielgud was invited in his position as the senior drama producer at BBC radio to oversee the experimental transmission of a short play on the new medium of television. The play, &quot;The Man With the Flower in His Mouth&quot; by Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello, was chosen because of its confined setting, small cast of characters and short length of around half an hour. Transmitted live on the evening of 14 July, the primitive state of television technology at the time allowed for only tiny 30-line pictures with one actor visible at a time, but the experiment was nonetheless judged to have been a success, and was watched by the then Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald.

Gielgud remained in radio for the rest of the decade, also working occasionally in film, adapting his thriller &quot;Death at Broadcasting House&quot;, in which he also appeared in a small acting role. In 1939 he returned to television for a time on a secondment to the BBC Television Service at Alexandra Palace, which was now a full-fledged, high-definition television network broadcasting to the London area. On secondment from his radio job, he produced one short play called &quot;Ending It&quot;, an adaptation of one of his own short stories starring John Robinson and Joan Marion, transmitted on 25 August 1939. However, a full-length play he was due to direct, and which had even been rehearsed, was cancelled from its planned slot on the evening of 1 September due to the television service having been suspended earlier that day in anticipation of the declaration of war.

Gielgud returned to radio for the duration of the Second World War, but shortly after the return of the television service in 1946, he moved across on a more permanent basis to become the Head of BBC television drama. Although the BBC hoped he would have the same impact on shaping the genre in the new medium as he had done in radio, his time in charge was not regarded as a success, as many of the producers working under him felt he had no great liking for television or appreciation for what it could achieve that radio could not. In 1952, he left the television service, being replaced by the experienced producer Michael Barry.

In the 1950s, Gielgud was involved in directing a run of Sherlock Holmes radio plays starring his brother John as the lead character, with Ralph Richardson as Dr Watson and Gielgud himself once appearing as Mycroft Holmes. These were broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s Light Programme. By this time Gielgud was in conflict with junior colleagues in the drama department; unlike them he was unable to appreciate the work of playwrights such as Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; would have made its English début in a radio production had Gielgud not rejected it.

==Private life==
Gielgud was married five times, the first in 1921 while he was still an undergraduate at Oxford, where he married an eighteen-year-old schoolgirl who was a student at Cheltenham Ladies College. She was Nathalie Mamontov (1903–1969), daughter of musician Sergei Mamontov (1877—1938) and Nathalie Sheremetievskaya; her mother&#x27;s third husband was Grand Duke Michael, brother of Tsar Nicholas II. This lasted for only two years, however, and they divorced in 1926.

Gielgud in 1928 married Barbara Dillon, an actress, who was born Mabel Barbara Joan Druce and was the daughter of the actor Hubert Druce and actress Frances Dillon (real name Ethel Buckle). She divorced him on the grounds of his desertion in 1943; he went on holiday alone in 1931 and they did not live together thereafter. The marriage produced a son, Adam, born in 1930 – father of the dancer and choreographer Piers Gielgud.

His following three marriages produced no further offspring.

He was awarded the CBE in 1958. He published &quot;&quot;One Year of Grace&quot; – A Fragment of Autobiography&quot; (Longmans, Green) in 1950 and the also autobiographical &quot;My Cats and Myself&quot; (Michael Joseph) in 1972. Val Gielgud died in London in 1981 at the age of eighty-one.

==Portrayal in fiction==
Gielgud appears as a character in the 2023 BBC radio play, &quot;A Wireless War&quot;, which tells the story of the relocation of the Radio Drama Company to Evesham at the start of World War II. Gielgud is played by Carl Prekopp.

<text>AMSAT-OSCAR 51 or AO-51 is the in-orbit name designation of a now defunct (following battery failure) LEO amateur radio satellite of the OSCAR series; formerly known as ECHO, built by AMSAT. It was launched on June 29, 2004 from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on a Dnepr launch vehicle. It is in Sun synchronous low Earth orbit.

AO-51 contained an FM repeater with both 144 MHz (VHF) and 1.2 GHz (L band) uplinks and 435 MHz (UHF) and 2.4 GHz (S band) downlinks. It also contained a digital subsystem that transmitted telemetry on 70 cm and provided a complete PACSAT BBS that could be configured on both V band and S band uplinks. As well, there was a 10-meter PSK uplink.

AO-51 had four VHF receivers, two UHF transmitters, six modems, and 56 channels of telemetry. The two UHF transmitters were connected to four phased antennas, yielding right-hand circular polarization for the 435.300 downlink and left-hand circular polarization for the 435.150 downlink.

The AO-51 FM satellite was easily workable with an amateur radio VHF dual band hand-held radio, as long as you knew when the satellite&#x27;s footprint was within reach. Transatlantic contacts had been made without much effort, as long as the satellite was approximately mid-Atlantic so that the edge of the satellites footprint was within reach on either continent.

As of May 2011 the satellite faced problems with the battery. By September, a work around for the battery issue was found, bringing the repeater back in use. On November 29, 2011, the AO-51 Command Team announced that AO-51 has ceased transmission and is not responding to commands.

<doc id="949189" wikidata="Q5264358" url="?curid=949189" title="Design matrix">
<text>In statistics and in particular in regression analysis, a design matrix, also known as model matrix or regressor matrix and often denoted by X, is a matrix of values of explanatory variables of a set of objects. Each row represents an individual object, with the successive columns corresponding to the variables and their specific values for that object. The design matrix is used in certain statistical models, e.g., the general linear model. It can contain indicator variables (ones and zeros) that indicate group membership in an ANOVA, or it can contain values of continuous variables.

The design matrix contains data on the independent variables (also called explanatory variables), in a statistical model that is intended to explain observed data on a response variable (often called a dependent variable). The theory relating to such models uses the design matrix as input to some linear algebra : see for example linear regression. A notable feature of the concept of a design matrix is that it is able to represent a number of different experimental designs and statistical models, e.g., ANOVA, ANCOVA, and linear regression.

==Definition==
The design matrix is defined to be a matrix formula_1 such that formula_2 (the &quot;j&quot;th column of the &quot;i&quot;th row of formula_1) represents the value of the &quot;j&quot;th variable associated with the &quot;i&quot;th object.

A regression model may be represented via matrix multiplication as
:formula_4
where &quot;X&quot; is the design matrix, formula_5 is a vector of the model&#x27;s coefficients (one for each variable), formula_6 is a vector of random errors with mean zero, and &quot;y&quot; is the vector of predicted outputs for each object.

==Size==
The design matrix has dimension &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;p&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of samples observed, and &quot;p&quot; is the number of variables (features) measured in all samples.

In this representation different rows typically represent different repetitions of an experiment, while columns represent different types of data (say, the results from particular probes). For example, suppose an experiment is run where 10 people are pulled off the street and asked 4 questions. The data matrix &quot;M&quot; would be a 10×4 matrix (meaning 10 rows and 4 columns). The datum in row &quot;i&quot; and column &quot;j&quot; of this matrix would be the answer of the &quot;i&quot; th person to the &quot;j&quot; th question.

==Examples==
===Arithmetic mean===
The design matrix for an arithmetic mean is a column vector of ones.

===Simple linear regression===
This section gives an example of simple linear regression—that is, regression with only a single explanatory variable—with seven observations.
The seven data points are {&quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;}, for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, …, 7. The simple linear regression model is
: formula_7
where formula_8 is the &quot;y&quot;-intercept and formula_9 is the slope of the regression line. This model can be represented in matrix form as
:formula_10
where the first column of 1s in the design matrix allows estimation of the &quot;y&quot;-intercept while the second column contains the &quot;x&quot;-values associated with the corresponding &quot;y&quot;-values. The matrix whose columns are 1&#x27;s and &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s in this example is the design matrix.

===Multiple regression===
This section contains an example of multiple regression with two covariates (explanatory variables): &quot;w&quot; and &quot;x&quot;.
Again suppose that the data consist of seven observations, and that for each observed value to be predicted (formula_11), values &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; of the two covariates are also observed. The model to be considered is
:formula_12
This model can be written in matrix terms as
:formula_13

Here the 7×3 matrix on the right side is the design matrix.

===One-way ANOVA (cell means model)===
This section contains an example with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with three groups and seven observations. The given data set has the first three observations belonging to the first group, the following two observations belonging to the second group and the final two observations belonging to the third group.
If the model to be fit is just the mean of each group, then the model is
:formula_14
which can be written
:formula_15
In this model formula_16 represents the mean of the formula_17th group.

===One-way ANOVA (offset from reference group)===
The ANOVA model could be equivalently written as each group parameter formula_18 being an offset from some overall reference. Typically this reference point is taken to be one of the groups under consideration. This makes sense in the context of comparing multiple treatment groups to a control group and the control group is considered the &quot;reference&quot;. In this example, group 1 was chosen to be the reference group. As such the model to be fit is
:formula_19
with the constraint that formula_20 is zero.
:formula_21
In this model formula_22 is the mean of the reference group and formula_18 is the difference from group formula_17 to the reference group. formula_20 is not included in the matrix because its difference from the reference group (itself) is necessarily zero.

<text>Kenneth Charles Cope (14 April 1931 – 11 September 2024) was an English actor and scriptwriter. He was best known for his roles as Marty Hopkirk in &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, Jed Stone in &quot;Coronation Street,&quot; Ray Hilton in &quot;Brookside&quot;, Sid in &quot;The Damned&quot; and as a minor member of the &quot;Carry On&quot; team.

==Early life==
Kenneth Cope was born on 14 April 1931 in Wavertree, Liverpool (at the time in Lancashire, now in Merseyside), England.

==Career==
After training to be an actor at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, Cope began playing character roles in films from the mid-1950s, and between 1961 and 1966 gained attention for his regular role in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as the shady Jed Stone, a part he returned to in 2008. In May 1963 he issued a single with Tony Hatch on the Pye label, inspired by Mike Sarne, titled &quot;Hands Off, Stop Mucking About&quot; b/w &quot;Why Am I So Shy&quot;. The single was credited to Ken Cope and the Breakaways. He boasted: &quot;It&#x27;ll get me a golden disc if one in every 24 folk who watch &quot;Coronation Street&quot; go out and buy the record.&quot; The record was not a success but it led to a regular slot as a disc jockey with Radio Luxembourg.

Cope also appeared in the satirical series &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; from 1962 until 1963.

He played Subutai in the 1965 film of the life of Genghis Khan, and in the same year appeared in &quot;Dateline Diamonds&quot; playing Lester Benson. In 1967 he appeared as Tom Savage in &quot;The Bird Who Knew Too Much&quot; episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

In &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; (1969–1970), Cope played the ghost private eye Marty Hopkirk opposite Mike Pratt&#x27;s Jeff Randall.

He also took leading roles in two &quot;Carry On&quot; films. In &quot;Carry On at Your Convenience&quot; (1971) he played Vic Spanner, the obnoxious shop steward central to the film&#x27;s trade union and industrial problems storyline and the rival in the film&#x27;s romantic sub-plot. In &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; (1972) he took the more sympathetic role of Cyril Carter, the son of a thief who is forced to impersonate a female nurse as part of his father&#x27;s attempt to rob a maternity hospital. Once there, Cyril finds love with a real nurse.

In an episode of the first series of &quot;The Adventures of Black Beauty&quot;, &quot;Sailor on a Horse&quot; (1972), he played Henry Thackery, a missing heir from Canada, returning from sea, just in time to save the land and Beauty&#x27;s paddock next to the Gordon family, which greedy, contentious lawyer Weems tries to sell by fraud, palming one of his clerks off as being the true heir. 

He appeared as Jack Victor in &quot;Catweazle&quot; (&quot;The Wogle Stone&quot;) in 1971. In 1975–1976 he wrote three series of the BBC children&#x27;s television series &quot;Striker&quot;, starring the young Kevin Moreton and inspired by the local youth football team in the village of Islip, Oxfordshire, where the Cope family was then living. Other screenwriting credits include &quot;A Sharp Intake of Breath&quot;.

Cope featured in three episodes of &quot;Minder&quot; playing different characters: newly released prisoner Albert Stubbs in &quot;Bury My Half at Waltham Green&quot;; &#x27;Scooter&#x27; in &quot;Waiting for Goddard&quot;; and police informer Phelan in &quot;Bring Me the Head of Arthur Daley&quot;.

He later appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot; (in 1981), and guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Casualty&quot;, as well as taking roles in &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;,&quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; and &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot;.

In 1984, Cope starred in &quot;Bootle Saddles&quot;, a surreal sitcom about a failing themed &#x27;cowboy village&#x27; on the outskirts of Merseyside. He played the lead character Percy James, who was passionate about the park despite the poor financial returns. The series appeared to be less a parody and more a sort of homage to 1950s and 1960s westerns, with episodes structured loosely around epics like &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. The characters rarely strayed out of their diegetic cowboy personas, despite the contemporary setting. The series was axed after one season.

In 1995 he appeared with his daughter Martha in an episode of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. In 1997 Cope played dodgy ex-copper Charlie Fairclough alongside David Jason in an episode of &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; titled &quot;True Confessions&quot;. From 1999 to 2002 he played Ray Hilton in the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot;.

Cope was offered a cameo role in the 2000–2001 revival of &quot;Randall and Hopkirk&quot; starring Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, but turned it down. He did, however, feature on the &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; section of the Series 1 DVD, wishing the cast of the remake well. He also provided the foreword to a &quot;Randall and Hopkirk Deceased&quot; retrospective book by Geoff Tibballs, published in 1994. In addition, an &#x27;Appreciation&#x27;, written by Cope, was included in the 2018 autobiography of Australian actress Annette Andre, &quot;Where Have I Been All My Life?&quot;.

Cope played Neville Harding in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Shadowplay&quot; (Series 4, episodes 11 and 12 of &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;).

In 2008 Cope&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot; character Jed Stone returned to the ITV soap after 42 years&#x27; absence, appearing as part of a storyline involving property developer Tony Gordon. The character was kept onscreen for several months before being written out again, and marked Kenneth Cope&#x27;s final acting appearance.

==Personal life==
Cope married actress Renny Lister, whom he had met when she worked on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, in 1961. They had two sons and a daughter together and lived in Witney, Oxfordshire. Their sons Nick and Mark Cope went on to form a rock band, The Candyskins. Their daughter, Martha Cope, is an actress. In 1997, Lister announced her retirement.

In 1974, Cope and his wife opened a restaurant, in Watlington, Oxfordshire, named Martha&#x27;s Kitchen after his daughter.

Cope was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2000, but six years later he was told this was a misdiagnosis; he later suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In January 2014, Cope appeared as a character witness during the trial of former &quot;Coronation Street&quot; colleague William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in the series.

In retirement Cope resided in Southport and wrote a weekly column for the weekly &quot;Southport Visiter&quot; newspaper. He was a loyal supporter of Everton F.C.

Cope died on 11 September 2024, aged 93.

<text>The Man With the Flower in His Mouth ( ) is a 1922 play by the Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello. It is particularly noteworthy for becoming, in 1930, the first piece of television drama ever to be produced in Britain, when a version was screened by the British Broadcasting Corporation as part of their experimental transmissions.

==Plot==
The play is a one-act &quot;dialogue&quot; derived, with small variations, from the novella &quot;La Morte Adosso&quot; (1923). The &quot;flower&quot; (&quot;il fiore in bocca&quot;) is cancer. The dialogue takes place in a bar, late at night, between a man who is dying of an epithelioma
and a peaceful businessman who has missed his train. In other words, between someone who intensely lives the little time left to him and someone who is rich with time to spend idly and irresponsibly, waiting for the morning train and entirely absorbed by the banal contretemps.

The exceptional nature of the moment, for the man who feels death upon him—to use Pirandello&#x27;s phrase—and the normality of it, for the one who is absorbed in the usual affairs of life with its small daily commitments, mark the two ends of the dialectic which is animated in the grand soliloquy of the protagonist.

He lucidly analyses his last sensations on earth, evoking scenes of common life, particulars of a quotidianity which are receding from him irremediably and which, for this reason, make precious the memories of even the most trivial events. In the solemnity of his solitude, he seems to have gained unexpected awarenesses of the life that is leaving him and of death. With no sense of regret or repentance, he almost seems to bitterly enjoy his unrepeatable experience marked by the echo of the end, which allows him to dedicate himself with interest to observing the anonymous life of others, in order to grasp its sense.

==Adaptations==
===1930 television version===
The BBC had been experimenting with John Logie Baird&#x27;s primitive 30-line television technology since the previous year, running test transmissions both from Baird&#x27;s own premises and from their own radio headquarters at Savoy Hill. In the summer of 1930 it was decided that a drama should be produced as a new test for and demonstration of the medium, and &quot;The Man With the Flower in His Mouth&quot; was selected for use because of its short length of around half an hour, its limited cast of only three characters and its confined setting.

The production was broadcast live on the afternoon of 14 July, from a set at the Baird company&#x27;s headquarters, 133 Long Acre in London. The production starred Earle Grey as &#x27;The Man&#x27;, Gladys Young as &#x27;The Woman&#x27; and Lionel Millard as &#x27;The Customer&#x27;. It was directed by the BBC&#x27;s head of radio drama at the time, Val Gielgud, and produced by Lance Sieveking. The artwork was by C. R. Nevinson.

Generally regarded as a successful experiment, the production was watched at the time by Ramsay MacDonald, the Prime Minister, with his family from their official residence at 10 Downing Street. Baird had installed one of his prototype &#x27;televisors&#x27; here two months previously, so that MacDonald could view the test transmissions he and the BBC were regularly broadcasting.

===1967 re-creation===
As the 1930 production was transmitted live, no record survives of it in the archives. However, in 1967, Bill Elliott, a technician working at Granada Television in Manchester, decided to attempt a re-creation of an extract of the play, using a replica of one of the 30-line Baird Televisiors he had constructed himself, which acted as both camera and monitor.

The 30-line signal was sufficiently low-band for Elliott to be able to record the production onto a stereo audio tape recorder, thus preserving it for posterity. Although Elliott did not re-create the entire play and used amateur student actors in the roles, he did secure the services of the original production&#x27;s producer, Lance Sieveking. Sieveking not only returned to produce the production in an attempt to assure as much authenticity as possible, but he was also able to provide the original artwork used in the play which was used again, and the very same 78-rpm gramophone record which had provided the music in 1930, which was also re-used.

The 1967 production survives in Elliott&#x27;s hands, and a small segment was seen in the 1985 Granada documentary series &quot;Television&quot;, a history of the medium.

===2007 opera===
In February 2007 an opera based on the play was premiered in De Munt in Brussels. The composer was Luc Brewaeys.

<doc id="949245" wikidata="Q2008214" url="?curid=949245" title="Roman commerce">
<text>Roman commerce was a major sector of the Roman economy during the later generations of the Republic and throughout most of the imperial period. Fashions and trends in historiography and in popular culture have tended to neglect the economic basis of the empire in favor of the lingua franca of Latin and the exploits of the Roman legions. The language and the legions were supported by trade and were part of its backbone. The Romans were businessmen, and the longevity of their empire was caused by their commercial trade.

Whereas in theory members of the Roman Senate and their sons were restricted when engaging in trade, the members of the equestrian order were involved in businesses despite their upper-class values, which laid the emphasis on military pursuits and leisure activities. Plebeians and freedmen held shop or manned stalls at markets, and vast numbers of slaves did most of the hard work. The slaves were themselves also the subject of commercial transactions. Probably because of their high proportion in society compared to that in Classical Greece, the reality of runaways, and the Servile Wars and minor uprisings, they gave a distinct flavor to Roman commerce.

The intricate, complex, and extensive accounting of Roman trade was conducted with counting boards and the Roman abacus. The abacus, which used Roman numerals, was ideally suited to the counting of Roman currency and tallying of Roman measures.

== Negotiatores, mercatores and pedlars ==
The &quot;negotiatores&quot; were in part bankers because they lent money on interest. They also bought and sold staples in bulk or did commerce in wholesale quantities of goods. The &quot;argentarii&quot; acted as agents in public or private auctions, kept deposits of money for individuals, cashed cheques (&quot;prescriptiones&quot;) and served as moneychangers. In some instances the &quot;argentarii&quot; are considered a subset of the &quot;negotiatores&quot; and in others as a group apart. The &quot;argentarii sometimes&quot; did the same kind of work as the &quot;mensarii&quot;, who were public bankers appointed by the state. They kept strict books, called &quot;tabulae&quot;, which were treated as legal proof by the courts.

The &quot;Mercatores&quot; were usually Plebeians or freedmen. They were present in all the open-air markets or covered shops, manning stalls or hawking goods by the side of the road. They were also present near Roman military camps during campaigns. They sold food and clothing to the soldiers and paid cash for any booty coming from military activities.

There is some information on the economy of Roman Palestine from Jewish sources of around the 3rd century AD. Itinerant pedlars (&quot;rochel&quot;) took spices and perfumes to the rural population. This suggests that the economic benefits of the Empire did reach, at least, the upper levels of the peasantry.

== Commercial infrastructure ==
The Forum Cuppedinis in ancient Rome was a market which offered general goods. At least four other large markets specialized in specific goods such as cattle, wine, fish and herbs and vegetables, but the Roman Forum drew the bulk of the traffic. 
All new cities, like Timgad, were laid out according to an orthogonal grid plan which facilitated transportation and commerce. These cities were connected by good roads. Navigable rivers were extensively used and some canals were dug, but neither leave such clear archaeological traces as roads. Consequently, they tend to be underestimated. Maintaining peace was a major factor in the expansion of trade. All settlements—especially the smaller ones—could be located in economically rational positions. Before and after the Roman Empire, hilltop defensive positions were preferred for small settlements and piracy made coastal settlement particularly hazardous for all but the largest cities.

By the 1st century, the provinces of the Roman Empire were trading huge volumes of commodities to one another via sea routes. There was an increasing tendency for specialization, particularly in manufacturing, agriculture and mining. Some provinces specialized in producing certain types of goods, such as grain in Egypt and North Africa and wine and olive oil in Italy, Hispania, and Greece.

Knowledge of the Roman economy is extremely patchy. The vast bulk of traded goods, being agricultural, normally leave no direct remains. Very exceptionally, as at Berenice, there is evidence of long-distance trade in black pepper, almonds, hazelnuts, stone pine cones, walnuts, coconuts, apricots and peaches besides the more expected figs, raisins and dates. The wine, olive oil and garum (fermented fish sauce) trades were exceptional in leaving &quot;amphorae&quot; behind. There is a single reference of the Syrian export of kipi stiff quince jam or marmalade to Rome.

=== Land routes ===

Even before the Roman Republic, the Roman Kingdom was engaged in regular commerce using the river Tiber. Before the Punic Wars completely changed the nature of commerce in the Mediterranean, the Republic had important commercial exchanges with Carthage. It entered into several commercial and political agreements with its rival city in addition to engaging in simple retail trading. The Roman Empire traded with the Chinese (via Parthian and other intermediaries) over the Silk Road.

=== Sea routes ===
Maritime archeology and ancient manuscripts from classical antiquity show evidence of vast Roman commercial fleets. The most substantial remains from this commerce are the infrastructure remains of harbors, moles, warehouses and lighthouses at ports such as Civitavecchia, Ostia, Portus, Leptis Magna and Caesarea Maritima. At Rome itself, Monte Testaccio is a tribute to the scale of this commerce. As with most Roman technology, the Roman seagoing commercial ships had no significant advances over Greek ships of the previous centuries, though the lead sheeting of hulls for protection seems to have been more common. The Romans used round hulled sailing ships. Continuous Mediterranean &quot;police&quot; protection over several centuries was one of the main factors of success of Roman commerce, given that Roman roads were designed more for feet or hooves – with most land trade moving by pack mule – than for wheels, and could not support the economical transport of goods over long distances. The Roman ships used would have been easy prey for pirates had it not been for the fleets of liburna galleys and triremes of the Roman navy.
Bulky, low-value commodities, like grain and construction materials, were traded only by sea routes, since the cost of sea transportation was sixty times lower than land. Staple goods and commodities like cereals for making bread and papyrus scrolls for book production were imported from Ptolemaic Egypt to Italy in a continuous fashion.

The trade over the Indian Ocean blossomed in the 1st and 2nd century AD. The sailors made use of the monsoon to cross the ocean from the ports of Berenice, Leukos Limen and Myos Hormos on the Red Sea coast of Roman Egypt to the ports of Muziris and Nelkynda in the Malabar Coast. The main trading partners in southern India were the Tamil dynasties of the Pandyas, Cholas and Cheras. Many Roman artifacts have been found in India; for example, at the archaeological site of Arikamedu, in Puducherry. Meticulous descriptions of the ports and items of trade around the Indian Ocean can be found in the Greek work &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; (see article on Indo-Roman trade).

=== Standard weights and measures ===
A standard amphora, the &quot;amphora capitolina&quot;, was kept in the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, so that others could be compared to it. The Roman system of measurement was built on the Greek system with Egyptian influences. Much of it was based on weight. The Roman units were accurate and well documented. Distances were measured, and systematically inscribed on stone by agents of the government.

A fairly standard and fairly stable and abundant currency, at least up to circa 200 AD, did much to facilitate trade. (Egypt had its own currency in this period and some provincial cities also issued their own coins.)

== Contacts with India and China ==
Alexander the Great had conquered as far as India, and the Roman god Bacchus was also said to have journeyed there. The Far East, like sub-Saharan Africa, was a mysterious land to the Romans.

=== India ===
There was an Indian in Augustus&#x27;s retinue (Plut. Alex. 69.9), and he received embassies from India (Res Gestae, 31); one which met him in Spain in 25 BC, and one at Samos in 20 BC.

The trade over the Indian Ocean blossomed in the 1st and 2nd century AD. The sailors made use of the monsoon to cross the ocean from the ports of Berenice, Leulos Limen and Myos Hormos on the Red Sea coast of Roman Egypt to the ports of Muziris and Nelkynda on the Malabar coast. The main trading partners in southern India were the Tamil dynasties of the Pandyas, Cholas and Cheras. Meticulous descriptions of the ports and items of trade around the Indian Ocean can be found in the Greek &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;. In Latin texts, the term Indians (&quot;Indi&quot;) designated all Asians, Indian and beyond.

The main articles imported from India were spices such as pepper, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, sandal wood and gems such as pearls, rubies, diamonds, emeralds and ivory. In exchange the Romans traded silver and gold. Hoards of Roman coins have been found in southern India during the history of Roman-India trade. Roman objects have been found in India in the seaside port city of Arikamedu, which was one of the trade centers.

Pomponius Mela argued for the existence of Northeast Passage through the northward strait out of the Caspian Sea (which in Antiquity was usually thought to be open to Oceanus in the north). 
=== China ===
There is suggestive archaeological evidence that Roman traders were present in Southeast Asia, which was roughly mapped out by Ptolemy in his &quot;Geography&quot; where he labelled the land bordering the &quot;Magnus Sinus&quot; (i.e., the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea) as the &quot;Sinae&quot;. Their port city of &quot;Cattigara&quot;, lying beyond the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) where a Greek sailor named Alexander allegedly visited, was quite possibly the ancient settlement at Oc Eo, Vietnam, where Roman artefacts from the Antonine period such as medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius (138–161) and Marcus Aurelius (161–180) have been found. An event recorded in the Chinese &quot;Weilue&quot; and &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; for the year 166 seems directly connected to this activity, since these texts claim that an embassy from &quot;Daqin&quot; (i.e., the Roman Empire) sent by their ruler &quot;An Dun&quot; (Chinese: 安敦; i.e., either Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius) landed in the southern province of Jiaozhi (i.e., northern Vietnam) and presented tributary gifts to the Chinese ruler Emperor Huan of Han. Rafe de Crespigny and Warwick Ball contend that these were most likely Roman merchants, not official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius (given the absence of this event in Roman sources).

Despite two other Roman embassies recorded in Chinese sources for the 3rd century and several more by the later Byzantine Empire (Chinese: 拂菻; Pinyin: &quot;Fú lǐn&quot;), only sixteen Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD) have been found in China at Xi&#x27;an that pre-date the greater amount of Eastern Roman (i.e., Byzantine) coins from the 4th century onwards. Yet this is also dwarfed by the amount of Roman coins found in India, which would suggest that this was the region where the Romans purchased most of their Chinese silk. For that matter, the spice trade remained more important to the Roman economy than the silk one.

From the 3rd century a Chinese text, the Weilüe, describes the products of the Roman Empire and the routes to it.

== Commerce and religion ==
Mercury, who was originally only the god of the &quot;mercatores&quot; and the grain trade eventually became the god of all who were involved in commercial activities. On the Mercuralia on May 14, a Roman merchant would do the proper rituals of devotion to Mercury and beseech the god to remove from him and from his belongings the guilt coming from all the cheating he had done to his customers and suppliers.

== The elite and a dual mentality on trade ==
While Livy makes reference to the Lex Claudia (218 BC) restricting senators and sons of senators from owning a ship with greater than 300 amphorae capacity (about seven tons), they were still undoubtedly partaking in trade as Cicero mentions this law when attacking Verres, although he makes no move to charge him.

Senators were still allowed to own and make use of ships under the size restriction, Cato when advising where to build a farm specifically mentions to have it built near an accessible river, road or port to allow transport of goods which is in direct conflict to Livy&#x27;s assertion that all profit made through trade by a senator was dishonorable. Senators often utilized free and enslaved agents as a loophole to legal restrictions, thereby allowing themselves to diversify their sources of income.

That is not to say that the acquisition of wealth was not to be desired, Pliny notes that a Roman man should by honorable means acquire a large fortune and Polybius draws a comparison between the attitudes of Carthage and Rome towards profit from trade. Thus starts the confusion in the role of the elite in trade as Terence writes that there is nothing wrong with large scale trade; it is in fact completely honorable and legitimate to import large quantities of product from around the world especially if it happens to lead to a successful trader buying land and investing in Roman agriculture; what is dishonorable is trade on a small scale. Small trade is again shown as vulgar by Tacitus as he describes the involvement of Sempronius Gracchus in petty trade.

Cato himself was involved with trade, although he himself cautioned against it as it was a risky occupation, perhaps this was part of the reasoning to keep senators excluded from the trade business, as if they had a severe misfortune with trading they could fall below the financial threshold of being a senator, whereas comparatively land owning was a far safer investment. Plutarch describes Cato&#x27;s involvement in trade in great detail, depicting how he would use a proxy (a freedman by the name of Quintio) to run his business through a group of fifty other men.

The restriction on senators trading was itself passed initially through the tribune of the plebeians, a class of people who the restrictions would not apply to. It is suspected that this reform could have been the equites and other wealthy merchants trying to muscle the senators out from the rapidly expanding trade business.

== Commercial classes ==
The majority of the people of the Roman Empire were living in rural areas, with a small part of the population engaged in commerce being much poorer than the elite. The industrial output was quite low, due to the fact that the poor majority could not pay for the products. Technological advance was hampered by this fact. Urbanization in the western part of the empire was also limited. Slaves accounting for most of the means of industrial output, rather than technology.

<doc id="949253" wikidata="Q3345101" url="?curid=949253" title="New Democrats (United States)">
<text>New Democrats, also known as centrist Democrats, Clinton Democrats, or moderate Democrats, are a centrist ideological faction within the Democratic Party in the United States. As the Third Way faction of the party, they are seen as culturally liberal on social issues while being moderate or fiscally conservative on economic issues. New Democrats dominated the party from the late 1980s through the early-2010s, and continue to be a large coalition in the modern Democratic Party.

With the rise of progressivism in 2016 and 2020, and that of the right-wing populism of Donald Trump, New Democrats began to change and update their ideological positions. Debates over tax cuts on capital gains have been reconfigured to removing caps on state and local tax deduction (SALT).

Despite expansion of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), even with stricter criteria for CPC representation in Congress, the New Democrats&#x27; Progressive Policy Institute (established in 1989) persists into the present day, sponsoring &quot;young pragmatists&quot; at the rechristened Center for New Liberalism, formerly known as the Neoliberal Project, to &quot;modernize progressive politics&quot;. In 2024, the CPC lost four seats in the overarching House Democratic Caucus, although the number of members in the CPC remained the same. At least two out of nine CPC freshmen planned to also hold seats in the New Democrat Coalition (NDC) as well, joining an additional twenty-two House Democrats who similarly claimed membership in both caucuses. The NDC lost approximately five members, yet gained twenty-three, reestablishing the coalition as the leading Democratic partisan caucus in Congress.

Brad Schneider, chief architect of cap removals from the SALT deductions, is NDC chairman in the 119th United States Congress over rival Sharice Davids. Schneider endorsed a rival candidate for the position, Sharice Davids, as Honorary Chair of the NDC ReNew Democracy Foundation (distinct from the Renew Democracy Initiative). In the aftermath of the loss in the 2024 United States presidential election, the CPC and NDC continue to debate the future of the Democratic Party.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

During the 1970s energy crisis, the United States faced stagflation, that is, both increasing inflation and decreasing economic growth. The 1974 midterm elections, according to historian Brent Cebul, &quot;are remembered for the arrival of the &#x27;Watergate babies&#x27; in the House of Representatives, but the New Democrats&#x27; first electoral wave was broader and deeper still...some western and northeastern officials like [Michael] Dukakis were dubbed Atari Democrats thanks to their veneration of new, entrepreneurial, high-technology sectors of the economy. This group, which included [Gary] Hart and California Governor Jerry Brown, also sometimes called themselves &#x27;New Liberals&#x27; in an effort to signal their support for traditional liberal social values even as they pursued market-oriented and perhaps less bureaucratic ways of governing.&quot; Another &quot;primary strand&quot; could be found in &quot;the South, often as self-consciously &#x27;centrist&#x27; Democrats. Led by politicians like Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, the southern centrists echoed southern Democrats of the past in their skepticism for targeted welfare or antipoverty programs, and they also looked forward to stimulating the region&#x27;s post-industrial and &#x27;post-racial&#x27; future.&quot;

The Watergate Babies and Atari Democrats found a common thread in supply-side progressivism. Ideas stemming from consultation with &quot;southern centrists&quot; became &quot;supply-side liberalism&quot; that, according to Cebul, ultimately proved a fiscal illusion. Michael Dukakis and Jerry Brown, for instance, both appropriated property taxes to subsidize a given startup company in depressed industrial sectors. This subsidization transformed state tax revenue for public finance into venture capital. Once the first wave of startups achieved normal profit, then the tax burden for additional start-ups would shift from real estate investors and homeowners to the initial companies. Brown and Dukakis also planned on allocating revenue from the new taxable capital to &quot;infrastructure and education.&quot; During the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan Administrations, voter tax revolts and the Volcker recession, coupled with uneven profit thresholds for taxing scaled-up companies, hastened the shift in tax burden to the entire first wave.

Even if absent from partisan politics for one or more election cycles, &quot;supply-side liberals&quot; could and did campaign to reconcile &quot;job and tax generation with the market-oriented ethos of the 1980s&quot; during reelection bids. Once back in office during the early 1980s recession in the United States, Dukakis and his cohort incrementally diverged from &quot;supply-side liberalism&quot; as it operated prior to the tax revolts. Beginning in 1982, for instance, Dukakis altered the role of his Massachusetts Technology Development Corporation (1978) from tax revenue distribution to &quot;broker[ing] deals&quot; between &quot;high-tech companies and Boston-based venture capital firms.&quot; This gradual change diminished his own role in the ensuing Massachusetts Miracle, a cornerstone of his campaign during the 1988 United States presidential election. Conversely, 1980s changes later became key tenets of New Democrat platforms.

===Democratic Leadership Council and Progressive Policy Institute===
After the landslide defeats to the Republican Party led by Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, a group of prominent Democrats began to believe their party was out of touch and in need of a radical shift in economic policy and ideas of governance. The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) was founded in 1985 by Al From and a group of like-minded politicians and strategists. Prominent Democratic politicians such as Senators Al Gore and Joe Biden (both future vice presidents, and Biden, a future president) participated in DLC affairs prior to their candidacies for the 1988 Democratic Party nomination. The DLC did not want the Democratic Party to be &quot;simply posturing in the middle&quot;, and instead framed its ideas as &quot;progressive&quot; and as a &quot;Third Way&quot; to address the problems of its era. Examples of the DLC&#x27;s policy initiatives can be found in &quot;The New American Choice Resolutions&quot;.

In 1989, the &quot;New Democrat&quot; label was briefly used by a progressive reformist group including Gary Hart and Eugene McCarthy. That same year, Will Marshall founded the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) as a think tank to formulate a new common platform for Yellow Dogs, Atari Democrats, and Watergate Babies. In 1990, the DLC renamed its bi-monthly magazine from &quot;The Mainstream Democrat&quot; to &quot;The New Democrat&quot;. The PPI, in conjunction with Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and the DLC, subsequently introduced tentative precepts collected in a &quot;New Orleans Declaration&quot;. By 1992, &quot;New Democrats&quot; had become more widely associated with this declaration, as well as Democratic partisans who entwined presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson&#x27;s variant of Rainbow/PUSH with the Sister Souljah moment.

Aspirations for &quot;supply-side liberalism&quot; had been rebuffed by voters and state auditors alike. According to Cebul, the rechristened &quot;New Democrats&quot; espoused &quot;a reflexive veneration of the market as the essential underwriter of social progress&quot;. They first sought to accelerate capital and money coursing through a post-industrial economy. The PPI and DLC forecasted financial deregulation and tax cuts as avenues to facilitate the expansion of scaleup companies invested in computational and internet technology. These companies would provide the venture capital necessary to pave over ailing industrial regions with post-industrial start-ups. The role of government was to remove any perceived obstacles. Heeding the lessons of tax resistance, the New Democrat think tank and leadership council also aimed to reduce the federal deficit and interest rates, while expanding the mortgage-backed security industry and credit market for a real estate sector that had roundly rejected property taxes. The voters who had stymied &quot;supply side liberalism&quot; would become a New Democrat vanguard.

Bill Clinton, the DLC chairman who referred to the PPI as his &quot;idea mill&quot;, faced a peculiar dilemma. He had to somehow circumvent voter preconceptions of financial deregulatory laws and capital gains tax reductions as antithetical to &quot;social progress&quot;, while concurrently accepting the duty of the largest party plurality, namely to advance the mid- to late 20th-century Democratic partisan goal of &quot;social progress&quot;. Cebul and additional scholars conclude that the DLC as well as PPI, and Clinton more specifically, offered a possible solution: cast &quot;the poor as unrealized entrepreneurs and impoverished communities as untapped &#x27;new markets&#x27; &quot;, ostensibly combining financial deregulation with claims for &quot;social progress&quot; in syncretic politics. After the 1988 elections that perpetuated the Reagan era, this did not seem such a controversial goal for a new national Democratic Party leader. 

===The New Covenant===

Historians such as James D. Boys contend that Clinton’s &quot;grand strategy, grand rhetoric&quot; of &quot;courting blue-collar voters&quot; resulted in a series of 1991 speeches to the DLC and his &quot;alma mater&quot; Georgetown University on a possible &quot;New Covenant&quot; platform. Clinton pledged &quot; &#x27;a New Covenant of change that will honor middle-class values...and make America work again.&#x27; &quot; In the context of global commerce, Clinton warned that protectionism was &quot; &#x27;a fancy word for giving up; our New Covenant must include a new trade policy that says to Europe, Japan, and our other trading partners: we favour an open trading system, but if you won’t play by those rules, we’ll play by yours.&#x27; &quot; The &quot;New Covenant&quot; was Clinton&#x27;s attempt &quot;to position his candidacy in a broad historical narrative. It was not, however, an expression that captured the public’s imagination&quot;, in contrast to Donald Trump&#x27;s later &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot;

Clinton advisor Benjamin Barber credited William Galston for coining the &quot;New Choice&quot; slogan and for reconfiguring it as a &quot;New Covenant.&quot; Galston, an NDC alum, focused on &quot;rhetoric, strategy, and vision.&quot; Galston formulated the slogan to define &quot;the president&#x27;s early interest in public–private partnerships&quot; and an approach to &quot;responsibility&quot; that wedded voters to delegates. According to Barber, Galston invoked &quot;covenant&quot; to connote &quot;American Puritanism&quot; and the &quot;social contract tradition that was part of America&#x27;s founding.&quot; The phrase held &quot;iconic value for the early Clinton agenda&quot;, despite its &quot;short shelf life.&quot; Less than a year after declining to continue as Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich reported that &quot;the two main accomplishments of the first year were passage of the first budget&quot; and the North American Free Trade Agreement. By the second year, &quot;almost sixty percent of the public now approves of the job B is doing as president, if polls can be believed.&quot; During a dinner with Bill Clinton, Clare Dalton, and Hillary Clinton, the latter two decried an imbalanced ratio of CEO incomes to wages of &quot; &#x27;loyal workers&#x27; &quot; and renounced corporations that defined &quot; &#x27;downsizing&#x27; &quot; as &quot; &#x27;middle-class&#x27; &quot; layoffs. Bill Clinton replied that he &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be out in front on these issues. I can&#x27;t be criticizing [corporations].&#x27; &quot;

John Nichols, writing in &quot;The Progressive&quot; during the Presidency of George W. Bush, further argued that the 1992 presidential campaign team engaged in a &quot;more populist &#x27;people first&#x27; rhetoric...Clinton&#x27;s 1992 scramble away from DLC language came as no surprise.&quot; Stan Greenberg, for example, noted that Clinton&#x27;s approval ratings did not increase &quot; &#x27;until he rejected the advice of conservatives of the party&#x27; and began to adopt populist and distinctly non-DLC rhetoric.&quot; New Democrats &quot;did much to define the first two years of the Clinton Presidency&quot;, which, according to Nichols, contributed to a Republican Revolution precipitated by &quot;the failure of millions of working class voters to go to the polls.&quot; In the aftermath, &quot;DLC cadres&quot; distanced themselves from NAFTA, adopted remnants of &quot;New Covenant&quot; rhetoric, and &quot;formed the New Democrat Network, a well-funded group dedicated to electing and reelecting corporation-friendly Democrats.&quot; As a result, the DLC &quot;expanded the House membership after both the 1996 and 1998 elections.&quot; Additional critics attribute the 1994 losses to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the Clinton health care plan of 1993.

In late September 1992, Joan Didion observed a shift, rather than &quot;failure&quot;, in meanings ascribed to a &quot;New Covenant&quot; by the Clinton campaign. She underscored those &quot;who wanted to dance with the Gores, join the club&#x27; &quot; as pressured to critique the seemingly &quot; &#x27;brain-dead policies in both parties&#x27;, most noticeably their own.&quot; The way to a &quot; &#x27;New Covenant&#x27; &quot; was, by the last month of the campaign, &quot; &#x27;not conservative or liberal, in many ways it is not even Republican or Democratic.&#x27; &quot; 

One of the last public references to a &quot;New Covenant&quot; was the 1995 State of the Union Address. By the second half of his first term, even while the First Lady struggled with her proposed healthcare plan, &quot;New Covenant&quot; came to signify various counterpoints to Congressional Republican bills and platforms, most notably the Contract with America. Clinton, increasingly acting on counsel from Dick Morris, had begun to entertain new frameworks for political economy, society, and culture, reconceiving the New Democrat &quot;social progress&quot; dilemma and the DLC approach to political thought. He sought &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; advisors that would, in turn, move beyond syncretic politics and attempt to shape a new Democratic Party, in a new way.

=== Presidency of Bill Clinton ===

Bill Clinton became the Democratic politician most identified with the New Democrats due to his promise of welfare reform in the 1992 presidential campaign, his 1992 promise of a middle-class tax cut and his 1993 expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor. The campaign occurred shortly after the end of the Cold War, at a time when faith in capitalism and internationalism were at their height, providing an opportunity for Bill Clinton to focus on domestic policy. New Democrat successes under Clinton, underpinned by the writings of Anthony Giddens on the duality of structure, maintained a total unity of opposites that became the hallmark of the Third Way. New Democrats subsequently aligned with Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s innovation economics and creative destruction as revolution, as well as concomitant criticism of intellectual property laws, in order to sustain their budding framework for a post-industrial political economy. 

New Democrats are often regarded to have inspired Tony Blair in the United Kingdom and his policies within the Labour Party as New Labour, as well as prompting the continental conflation of Third Way approaches to social democracy with previous notions of democratic socialism. The two were often used interchangeably by political scientists and fostered popular conceptions of democratic socialism as a social-democratic variant or wing of libertarian socialism.
Clinton presented himself as a New Democrat candidate and continued to appeal to white middle-class voters who had left the Democratic Party for the Republican Party. He promised to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot;. Until 2016 and even after, the Third Way defined and dominated notions of centrism in U.S. partisan politics. Political analysts such as Kenneth Baer further that the DLC embodied the spirit of Truman–Kennedy era Democrats and were vital to the Democratic Party&#x27;s resurgence after the failure of the George McGovern, Walter Mondale, and Michael Dukakis presidential campaigns.

====Bipartisan Bill Proposals and Acts (1992-2000)====
New Democrats dialectically adopted Republicans proposals and platforms during the campaigns for the 1992 congressional/state elections and 1992 United States presidential election. As a result, particularly after the 1994 midterm elections when Republicans regained control of Congress, they signed legislation endorsed by Republicans, who gave its support; not all Democrats supported them. Both the Defense of Marriage Act and Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWOA) became law three months before the 1996 United States elections. It was in his 1996 State of the Union Address that Clinton declared: &quot;The era of big government is over.&quot; After Clinton vetoed two versions of the bill that ultimately became PRWOA, &quot;Svengali-like advisor Dick Morris---upon whom Clinton had grown increasingly dependent, politically and psychologically, in the aftermath of the 1994 debacle---insisted that a third veto could cost him his reelection in 1996.&quot;

Legislation that received bipartisan support under President Clinton included:
* The North American Free Trade Agreement, a core international agreement signed during the presidency of George H. W. Bush without NAALC/NAAEC and required Congressional approval for implementation. It is still largely in effect via the succeeding USMCA and proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.
* The Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell ban on openly gay people serving in the Armed Forces (repealed in 2010).
* The Defense of Marriage Act that prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. It was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 and repealed in 2022, the latter with support from 24% of Congressional Republicans.
* The Religious Freedom Restoration Act federal religious discrimination statute.
* The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, sometimes referred to as the 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill.

Legislative examples of bipartisan authorship included:
* 1996 Defense of Marriage Act: Bob Barr (R-GA) (Republican introduction)
* 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act: John Kasich (R-OH) with ideas and provisions from Clinton&#x27;s 1994 proposal
* 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act: John Kasich (R-OH) with ideas and provisions from New Democrats
* 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: Phil Gramm (R-TX), Jim Leach (R-IA), and Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-VA) with ideas and provisions from New Democrats

Congressional Democrat voting percentages for the foregoing examples:
* 1996 Defense of Marriage Act: 64% Democratic Representatives support and 72% Democratic Senators support
* 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act: 50% Democratic Representatives support and 53% Democratic Senators support
* 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act: 80% Democratic Representatives support and 82% Democratic Senators support
* 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: 75% Democratic Representatives support and 84% Democratic Senators support

The Clinton Administration, supported by congressional New Democrats, was responsible for proposing and passing the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which increased Medicare taxes for taxpayers with annual incomes over $135,000, yet also reduced Medicare spending and benefits across all tax brackets. Congressional Republicans demanded even deeper cuts to Medicare but Clinton twice vetoed their bills. The Clinton Administration in turn taxed individuals earning annual incomes over $115,000 but also defined taxable small business earnings as high as $10 million in annual gross revenue, with tax brackets for &quot;high-gross incorporated businesses&quot; beginning at that number. According to the Clinton Foundation, the revised brackets and categories increased taxes on the wealthiest 1.2% of taxpayers within these new brackets, while cutting taxes on 15 million low-income families and making tax cuts available to 90% of small businesses. Small businesses and taxpayer classifications were reconfigured by these new tax brackets.

Clinton&#x27;s promise of welfare reform was passed in the form of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996. Prior to 2018, critics such as Yascha Mounk contended that Clinton&#x27;s arguments for the virtues of &quot;negative&quot; notions of &quot;personal responsibility&quot;, such as the &quot;New Orleans Declaration&quot;&#x27;s &quot;individual responsibility&quot; propounded within DLC circles during the 1980s, stemmed more from Reagan&#x27;s specific conception of &quot;accountability&quot; than any &quot;positive notion of responsibility&quot;. Additional critics distinguish the New Democrat idea of &quot;personal responsibility&quot; from arguments over the extent of limitations on government, if any, in platforms that advance social responsibility. The 1996 United States presidential election, Dick Morris&#x27; advice to relegate Hillary Clinton to lecturing on the global promotion of microcredit (argued by Claremont McKenna College historian Lily Geismer), partisan compromises over this act, conflicts within the Democratic Party, as well as the act&#x27;s multivalent consequences, all contributed to deliberations over passage and execution of the PRWORA.

Democratic partisan criticism of the first Clinton Administration, as well as the formation of the Blue Dog Coalition, particularly in response to proposals and actions by the First Lady, followed 1994 congressional New Democrat losses in the southeast and west coast. Clinton&#x27;s reassertion as a New Democrat during the 1996 presidential elections, and passage of the PRWORA, contributed to the founding of the New Democrat Coalition, reaffirming Clintonian Democrats as New Democrats. As of August 2023, 23% of the New Democrat Coalition have become simultaneous members of, or declared an intention to vote for more proposals by, the Congressional Progressive Caucus. A number of these delegates, most notably Shri Thanedar, faced backlash from pundits and constituents alike, as evidence surfaced of alleged involvement in post-2016 attempts to rally neoconservatism. Despite the controversy, certain delegates were reelected in 2024, including Thanedar.

===Presidency of Barack Obama ===

In March 2009, Barack Obama, said in a meeting with the New Democrat Coalition that he was a &quot;New Democrat&quot; and a &quot;pro-growth Democrat&quot;, that he &quot;supports free and fair trade&quot;, and that he was &quot;very concerned about a return to protectionism&quot;. Many Obama cabinet picks and House and Senate Democrats were New Democrats. From 2007 to 2011, the New Democrats were the leading swing bloc in the House, and were the main authors of the legislation on bailouts and financial regulation of derivatives. The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), which gave rise to New Democrats but that since the 2000s had lost some of its influence, and the DLC closed down in February 2011 due to financial issues; however, New Democrats remained influential through the Third Way organization, and New Democrats proved key swing votes in subsequent years. During his presidency, pundits debated if Obama moved to the left, citing the lack of the DLC&#x27;s influence from its heydays, or whether, forced by Republican gains in Congress, he doubled down on triangulation.

The Obama Administration espoused &quot;free and fair trade&quot; ideas. Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) proponents postponed TPP drafting after Obama became President, only to commence formal Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations in 2010, after Executive Office (EO) disclosure of an endorsement, albeit with Obama&#x27;s proposed revisions on, for instance, intellectual property. Early drafts of Executive Order 13609 principally by Cass Sunstein, &quot;Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation&quot;, buttressed the TPP deliberations with the premise that &quot;inadequate cooperation and consultation&quot; had been caused by &quot;excessive red tape&quot; for &quot;businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises operating near the border.&quot; In the final draft, Obama advisors such as Sunstein applied the Executive Order to all such &quot;enterprises&quot;, in the absence of regional and tax bracket classifications, operating within &quot;North America and beyond&quot;. In 2015, the Obama EO released &quot;The Economic Benefits of U.S. Trade&quot;, a signatory framework for prospective drafts of the TPP and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). According to the Obama EO, free trade &quot;help[s] developing countries lift people out of poverty&quot; and &quot;expand[s] markets for U.S. exports&quot;. 

Throughout Obama&#x27;s tenure, approximately 1,000 Democrats lost their seats across all levels of government. Specifically, 958 state legislature seats, 62 House seats, 11 Senate seats, and 12 governorships, with a majority of these elected officials identifying as New Democrats. Some analysts, such as Harry Enten at &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, believe this was due to the changing demographic shift, as more Democrats identified as liberal in 2016 than moderate. Consequently, many pundits believed that Obama&#x27;s tenure marked an end of the New Democrats&#x27; dominance in the party, although the faction still remains an important part of the party&#x27;s big tent. Obama signed the draft Trans-Pacific Partnership, yet subsequently declared his &quot;Economic Benefits of Free Trade&quot; framework as &quot;dead&quot; prior to the lame-duck session of Congress, in anticipation of bipartisan opposition to TPP ratification.

=== Decline in the 2010s and 2020s ===
Historian Gary Gerstle argues that support for neoliberalism declined in the United States in both parties in 2016, with both Trumpism and progressivism opposing central tenets of neoliberalism. For example, Trump and Sanders both opposed the Transatlantic Pacific Partnership during the 2016 United States presidential election. President Trump then refused to sign any draft TPP, precluding further revisions to garner U.S. participation. In contrast, Trump initially indicated willingness to continue TTIP negotiations with substantial changes. On the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic, the TTIP dissolved into trade disputes between the European Union (EU) and the Trump Administration. Trump&#x27;s approach to curbing the pandemic became the focus of EU delegate concerns, superseding the unresolved trade conflicts. Despite this, New Democrats have continued to be a large coalition within the big tent of the Democratic Party.

==== Hillary Clinton presidential campaign ====
Ahead of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, many New Democrats were backing the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, the wife of former New Democrat president Bill Clinton, who served as a senator from New York during the 2000s and as Barack Obama&#x27;s Secretary of State during the early 2010s. Originally considered to be an expected nominee, Clinton faced an unexpected challenge from Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders, whose campaign garnered the support of progressive and younger Democrats. Ultimately, Clinton won 34 of the 57 contests, compared to Sanders&#x27; 23, and garnered about 55 percent of the vote. Nevertheless, commentators saw the primary as a decline in the strength of New Democrats in the party, and an increasing influence of progressive Democrats within the party.

Ahead of the formal announcement of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks published the Democratic National Committee email leak, in which DNC operatives, many of whom were New Democrats, seemed to deride Sanders&#x27; campaign, and discuss ways to advance Clinton&#x27;s nomination, leading to the resignation of DNC chair, and New Democrat member, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other implicated officials. The leak was allegedly part of an operation by the Russian government to undermine Hillary Clinton.

Although the ensuing controversy initially focused on emails that dated from relatively late in the primary, when Clinton was nearing the party&#x27;s nomination, the emails cast doubt on the DNC&#x27;s neutrality towards progressive and moderate candidates. This was evidenced by alleged bias in the scheduling and conduct of the debates, as well as controversial DNC–Clinton agreements regarding financial arrangements and control over policy and hiring decisions. Other media commentators have disputed the significance of the emails, arguing that the DNC&#x27;s internal preference for Clinton was not historically unusual and didn&#x27;t affect the primary enough to sway the outcome. The controversies ultimately led to the formation of a DNC &quot;unity&quot; commission to recommend reforms in the party&#x27;s primary process.

==== Presidency of Joe Biden ====

The winner of the 2020 United States presidential election was Joe Biden, who served as vice president under Barack Obama. Although Biden has not explicitly self-identified as a New Democrat, Biden identifies as a moderate Democrat and opposes some progressive positions. During his presidency, Biden has broken with New Democrat policies on some issues, such as spending and free trade. In the 2020 United States House of Representatives elections, 13 Democrats lost their seats. All thirteen Democrats that lost their seats had won in the 2018 mid-term elections. Of those 13 members, 10 of them were New Democrats. During the 117th United States Congress, the New Democrat Coalition lost its status as the largest ideological coalition in favor of the more left leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus. The CPC was founded in 1991 but only began catching up and eventually surpassed the New Democrat Coalition in the 2010s.

The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has been characterized by some as the end of the post-Cold War era and liberal internationalism. Clinton was elected in 1992 shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when New Democrats were at the peak of their influence. As of December 2023, Biden has largely maintained Trump&#x27;s protectionist trade policies, and has not negotiated any new free trade agreements. Labor unions, an important constituency for Biden&#x27;s re-election, opposed removing Trump&#x27;s tariffs. The PPI pressured the Biden Administration to revoke Obama&#x27;s &quot;dead&quot; position and join the TPP. Instead, the Biden Executive Office negotiated and initiated the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). The 2024 United States presidential election, as well as partisan dissent in participating member-states, forestalled further implementation and ratification of the IPEF. Biden withdrew from the presidential election on July 21, 2024.

==== 2020s ====
The defeat of Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election occasioned a variety of responses from think tanks and political journals. William Galston of the Brookings Institution, for example, argued that &quot;by refusing to explain why she had abandoned the progressive positions on crime, immigration, health care, and climate change, she blurred the public&#x27;s perception of her&quot;, while conversely opening &quot;the door to the Trump campaign&#x27;s charge that she was a closet radical&quot;. 

&quot;Politico&quot; found a common thread for Democrats who won swing districts, arguing that these candidates all elucidated their respective platforms on economics, labor, abortion rights, and gun control rather than solely engaging in Trump resistance politics during their campaigns. It also indicated that &quot;centrists have urged the party to de-emphasize cultural issues after Trump successfully ran TV ads knocking Harris over transgender policies that after-action reports found helped persuade working-class voters.&quot; Pundits distinguished the &quot;cultural estrangement between a lot of voters out there and the Democrats&quot; (in Conor Lamb&#x27;s words) from the economic concerns that Democratic Party candidates should have explicated for voters without college degrees, voters without college degrees, including those who faced barriers to universal access in the classroom. On the other hand, according to the same &quot;New York Times&quot; estimates, Republican Party candidate and President Donald Trump &quot;has made larger gains among Black, Hispanic, Asian American and young voters in his three campaigns since 2016 than he has among white voters without a college degree.&quot; In the realm of foreign policy, Irie Senter, writing a January 2025 report for &quot;Politico&quot;, described the &quot;pro-Palestinian movement&quot; as tending to focus on &quot;who controls the White House&quot; and more frequently &quot;Democrats, whom its leaders view as more persuadable to soften support for Israel&quot;. Senter observed that &quot;support for Israel is largely bipartisan, but Republicans have led the charge in criticizing the broader pro-Palestinian movement.&quot;

A majority of American adults over the age of 25 do not have college degrees, per the map. The Democratic Party&#x27;s support depending heavily on White voters with college degrees thus geographically limits the party. In particular, of the electoral jurisdictions that Kamala Harris won in 2024, all except New Mexico (48.6% plurality-Hispanic state) had above-average educational attainment.
*Among white voters who didn&#x27;t attend college, Harris lost 25-73%. Among White voters with an Associate&#x27;s degree, Harris lost 31-67%. Among White voters with &quot;some college,&quot; Harris lost 38-61%. Among White voters with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree, Harris tied 49-49%. Among White voters with a graduate degree, Harris won 58-40%. For reference, As a whole, Harris lost White voters 42-57%.
*Also note that among White voters, since educational attainment strongly positively correlates to income, among White voters in 2024, income was negatively correlated with support for Kamala Harris. Specifically, Harris lost White voters making less than $30,000 (34-63%), those making between $30,000 to $49,999 (37-62%), and those making $50,000 to $99,999 (42-56%). Harris only narrowly lost White voters making $100,000 to $199,999 (49-50%) and those making more than $200,000 (48-51%). 
*There was no income or educational polarization among African American voters, who supported Harris 86-13%.

During the 2020s, New Democrats engaged in debates over transgender rights in the United States. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; and Ipsos poll (2025), &quot;67 percent of Democratic respondents [versus 94% of Republican respondents] opposed transgender athletes competing in women’s sports.&quot; Representatives such as Lori Trahan, a former 1990s Division I college athlete who holds seats in both the NDC and CPC, did believe that Republicans raised &quot;legitimate concerns about transgender athletes&quot;, yet also conterminously &quot;criticized Republican lawmakers for injecting themselves into the issue.&quot;

== Ideology ==
According to Dylan Loewe, New Democrats tend to identify as fiscally moderate-to-conservative and socially liberal. Columnist Michael Lind argued that neoliberalism for New Democrats was the &quot;highest stage&quot; of left liberalism. The counterculture youth of the 1960s became more fiscally conservative in the 1970s and 1980s but retained their cultural liberalism. Many leading New Democrats, including Bill Clinton, and Gary Hart, started out in the George McGovern wing of the Democratic Party and gradually moved toward the right on economic and military policy. According to historian Walter Scheidel, both major political parties shifted towards promoting free-market capitalism in the 1970s, with Republicans moving further to the political right than Democrats to the political left. He noted that Democrats played a significant role in the financial deregulation of the 1990s. Gerstle and anthropologist Jason Hickel contended that the neoliberal policies of the Reagan era were carried forward by the Clinton Administration, forming a new economic consensus which crossed party lines. According to Gerstle, &quot;across his two terms, Clinton may have done more to free markets from regulation than even Reagan himself had done.&quot;

Historian Michael Kazin argues that New Democrat fiscal and monetary ideas marked a divergence from U.S. fiscal variants of Keynesian public spending. Keynesian economics aimed to stimulate individual and group consumption of goods and services in a given economic sector, until monetary circulation crossed a predetermined sector threshold for contraction in economic liberalism. This U.S. iteration of Keynesianism, coupled with budget deficits, began during the latter half of the Second New Deal and became a hallmark of early Cold War liberalism. In contrast, Clinton&#x27;s &quot;the era of big government is over&quot; marked a more global shift to a new neoclassical synthesis, culminating in the post-war displacement of Keynesianism with creative destruction and various approaches to the service-commodity goods continuum in a post-industrial economy. 

New Democrat monetary ideas aligned with easy money policy and the Greenspan put from the Reagan Administration, resulting in Clinton&#x27;s reappointment of Alan Greenspan as Chair of the Federal Reserve. For &quot;moral capitalism&quot;, Kazin favored U.S interpretations of New Keynesian economics in Progressive Caucus platforms, albeit with a more diversified consumer base. Five weeks after the 2024 elections, CPC chair-elect Greg Casar dated &quot;serious discontent&quot; with the Democratic Party to both New Democrat and neoconservative government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis, as well as to fiscal grievances by Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter.

The 2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence, as well as Barack Obama&#x27;s 2010 endorsement of the Volcker Rule, evinced a trend away from this New Democrat shift and concomitant tax brackets. During the COVID-19 pandemic and everything bubble, fiscal and monetary stimuli, as well as targeting in monetary policy to curb inflation, came under public and scholarly scrutiny. Debates focused on whether pandemic policymaking should be regarded solely as &quot;COVID-Keynesianism&quot;, with more flexibility in deficit spending, or an advancement in the connected, yet distinct, trend. The latter would add a sustained expansion of financial regulatory authority to address any adverse effects of windfall profits, substantial price gouging, and artificial scarcity on the US economy. The 2021–2023 inflation surge has called into question the efficacy of increased federal spending and deficits.

===Criticism===

New Democrats have faced criticism from progressives and liberals further to their left, as well as the broader American Left. In a 2017 BBC News interview, Noam Chomsky said that &quot;the Democrats gave up on the working class forty years ago&quot;. In the aftermath of his 2020 presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders stated that &quot;the Democratic Party has become a party of the coastal elites, folks who have a lot of money, upper-middle-class people&quot;. Political analyst Thomas Frank asserted that the Democratic Party began to represent the interests of the professional class rather than the working class.

In &quot;Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?&quot; (2016), Frank was one of the few analysts who foresaw that Donald Trump could win the 2016 U.S. presidential election, attributing it to New Democrats alienating working class voters. Nate Cohn of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Trump had made larger gains with racial minority voters than with white voters without college degrees compared to the 2012 U.S. presidential election, with the Democratic Party&#x27;s gains being mainly just among white voters with college degrees. Democrats also lost further ground with white voters without college degrees, costing them crucial Rust Belt states in the 2024 elections. Journalist Michael Cuenco argues that New Democrats have caused the Democratic Party to lose voters without college degrees, who make up the majority of voters.

After the 2024 elections, &quot;The Nation&quot; editor D. D. Guttenplan noted that Kamala Harris had been &quot;cozily campaigning with the Cheneys&quot;, which alienated &quot;as least as many potential voters as it attracted.&quot; Likewise, John Nichols observed both Bernie Sanders and Shawn Fain, despite outward appearances, desperately attempting to persuade the Harris campaign &quot;to return to the economic populism—and clear appeal to working-class voters—they had embraced in Chicago (only to abandon it in favor of attacks on Trump&#x27;s character once the big donors weighed in).&quot;

==Events==

===January===
* January 6 – Dennis Eckersley and Paul Molitor are elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the BBWAA in their first year of eligibility. Eckersley, who spent a 24-year career with the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals, is one of only a few pitchers to excel as both a starter and a closer, becoming the only pitcher in Major League history to collect 100 complete games and 100 saves, while posting ten or more wins 10 times, including a 20-win season, a no-hitter in 1977, and winning the American League MVP and Cy Young Awards in 1992. A versatile player, able to cover positions across infield and outfield, Molitor is only the third player with at least 3,000 hits 600 doubles and 500 stolen bases, being the others Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner. Besides, Molitor collected seven consecutive hits with the Milwaukee Brewers in the 1982 World Series, including the first five-hit game ever in a Series. At the age of 37, after signing with the Toronto Blue Jays, Molitor collected 111 RBI, becoming the oldest player in Major League history to post his first 100-RBI season. Then when Toronto defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games in the 1993 World Series, he was named MVP after hitting a .500 average (12-for-24) with two home runs and eighth RBI, while tying a Series record with 10 runs scored.
* January 12 – Roger Clemens signs a contract with the Houston Astros, ending his retirement after the 2003 season.

* March 4 – Commissioner Bud Selig announces that Major League Baseball will celebrate Jackie Robinson Day in every ballpark on April 15, commemorating and honoring the anniversary of the debut of Jackie Robinson, who became the first black major league baseball player of the modern era in the 1947 season. Previously, Robinson&#x27;s uniform number &quot;42&quot; was retired for all time in a ceremony at Shea Stadium in April 1997 to mark the 50th anniversary of his achievement. His debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers ended approximately 80 years of baseball segregation, also known as the baseball color line.
* March 21 – Veterans Stadium, home of the Philadelphia Phillies from 1971 to 2003, is demolished in a 62-second implosion. It hosted the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball from 1971 to 2003 and the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League from 1971 to January 2003. Likewise, the 1976 and 1996 Major League Baseball All-Star Games were held at the venue, and the Vet also hosted the annual Army-Navy football game seventeen times between 1980 and 2001.

===April===
* April 8 – In the first-ever regular-season game at San Diego&#x27;s Petco Park, the San Diego Padres defeat the San Francisco Giants, 4-3, in ten innings.

The Yankees become the first team to have two pitchers record their 200th career victories in the same season, and their duo reaches their milestones in consecutive games.
* April 18 – At Wrigley Field, Sammy Sosa sets the record for most home runs in a Chicago Cub uniform. In the first inning of the Cubs&#x27; 11-10, 10-inning loss to the Cincinnati Reds, Sosa, who entered the game tied with Ernie Banks with 512 home runs as a Cub, homers off Paul Wilson; he will hit another home run off Wilson in the third inning. At the end of the season, Sosa will be traded to the Baltimore Orioles, after hitting 545 home runs as a Cub.
* April 27 – Chad Moeller becomes the fifth Milwaukee Brewers player to hit for the cycle, the first to do it at home, and the first since Paul Molitor did it on May 15, against the Minnesota Twins.

===May===
* May 8 – At Fenway Park, Pokey Reese has the first two-homer game of his career in the Boston Red Sox&#x27; 9-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals.

Reese hits an inside-the-park home run and one of the conventional type over the Green Monster, to snap a 172 at-bat homerless streak dating to April 4, 2003. The last Red Sox player to hit a conventional homer and an inside-the-park homer in the same game was Tony Armas on September 24, , at Tiger Stadium.
* May 12 – In one of the most remarkable at-bats in major league history, Alex Cora fouls off 14 consecutive pitches and then hits the 18th pitch over the right field fence for a two-run home run off Chicago Cubs pitcher Matt Clement.

* May 18 – Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson becomes only the 17th person in major league history to throw a perfect game, throwing 13 strikeouts on his way to a 2-0 defeat of the Atlanta Braves.
* May 26 – The Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; Daryle Ward hits for the cycle in the Pirates&#x27; 11-8 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. It is done 23 times in Pittsburgh history and 243 times in the majors since 1882. Ward joins his father, Gary Ward, to become the first father-son combination in major league history to hit for the cycle. The senior Ward accomplished the feat on September 18, , for the Minnesota Twins.
* May 28 – Mariano Rivera notches his 300th career save in the New York Yankees&#x27; 7-5 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He also becomes the first Yankee and 17th reliever in major league history to reach the milestone.

===June===
* June 12 – San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds drills a solo home run (the 675th of his career) off the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; Rodrigo López, who becomes the 400th pitcher to be a victim. Bonds&#x27; performance upstages a milestone afternoon by Rafael Palmeiro, who hits his 536th and 537th homers to move past Mickey Mantle into 11th place on the career list. It is only the third time in baseball history that two players with 500 homers connect in the same game. Willie Mays and Ernie Banks did it in , and Mays and Hank Aaron both homered on May 8, .
* June 20 – On Father&#x27;s Day afternoon at Busch Stadium, with his father, Ken Griffey, Sr., in attendance, Cincinnati Reds outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. goes deep on a 2-2 fastball from the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Matt Morris, securing a spot in the record books as the 20th player with 500 career home runs.

* June 24 – Carlos Beltrán is traded from the Royals to the Astros.
* June 25 – Larry Walker hits 3 home runs helping the Colorado Rockies beat the Cleveland Indians 10-8.
* June 26 – With a 6-4 victory over the Florida Marlins, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays have a record of 36-35, becoming the first team in Major League history to have a winning record &quot;after&quot; being 18 games under .500. At one point in the season, they are 10-28, then go on a 26-7 run. Before falling under .500 for good in July, the Rays win or tie 13 out of 14 series, including three consecutive sweeps during a club-record 12-game winning streak.
* June 27 – College World Series: Cal State Fullerton wins the NCAA College World Series, defeating Texas 3-2 to win the best-of-three championship series 2-0. The Longhorns later stir up controversy by refusing to accept the runner-up trophy.
* June 28 – David Bell hits for the cycle as the Philadelphia Phillies slug their way to a 14-6 victory over the Montreal Expos. Bell goes 4-for-4, scores two runs, and gets a career-high six RBI. He becomes the third player to hit for the cycle this season, joining the Pirates&#x27; Daryle Ward and the Brewers&#x27; Chad Moeller. Coincidentally, Ward and his father Gary Ward accomplish the feat, and when Bell achieves the honor, he joins his grandfather Gus Bell, who turned the trick on June 4, .
* June 29 – At home, the Yankees&#x27; Tony Clark hits a deep-center two-run homer off Derek Lowe, to help his team to an 11-3 win over the Boston Red Sox. Clark joins Bernie Williams and Danny Tartabull as the only players to reach the center-field bleachers more than once since the remodeled Yankee Stadium opened in .

===July===
* July 1 – The Yankees defeat the Red Sox 5-4 in 13 innings in a game notable for Derek Jeter making a running catch and promptly flying into the stands to save a Red Sox run and John Flaherty&#x27;s pinch-hit walk-off single that seals a three-game sweep for the Yankees.
* July 5 – Éric Gagné&#x27;s consecutive saves streak ends at 84 in a 6-5 Los Angeles Dodgers victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the last team to keep him from converting a save. Gagné hasn&#x27;t blown a save chance since David Dellucci hit a game-tying double on August 26, 2002. These are his only blown saves in 75 attempts at Dodger Stadium. During the streak, Gagné blew the lead in the 2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game when he allowed a home run to the Texas Rangers&#x27; Hank Blalock, but that exhibition game did not count in the statistics.
* July 6 – Detroit Tigers pitcher Jason Johnson becomes the first player in Major League Baseball history to get permission to wear an insulin pump on the field. A diabetic, Johnson wears the pump on his belt on the left side of his lower back, in order to minimize the chance of it being hit by a bat or thrown ball.
* July 10 – Barry Bonds breaks his own record for intentional walks received in a season; amazingly, he breaks the former full-season record of 68, set in 2002, before the All-Star break.

* July 13 – In the 75th All-Star Game, played at Minute Maid Park, the American League rocks Roger Clemens for six runs in the first inning, including home runs by Manny Ramírez and Alfonso Soriano, and coasts to a 9-4 victory over the National League before 41,886 fans. Mark Mulder is the winning pitcher, Clemens gets the loss, and Soriano is selected the MVP.
* July 16 – Cleveland Indians catcher Víctor Martínez hits three home runs, singles twice, draws a walk, and drives in a career-high seven runs in a perfect 5-for-5 game, recording his first career multi-homer game, as the Indians belt eight homers and 21 hits in an 18-6 rout of the Seattle Mariners. Matt Lawton, Casey Blake, Ben Broussard, Travis Hafner and Jody Gerut add shots; Lawton, Martínez and Blake homer in consecutive at-bats in the third inning. It is the first time Cleveland hits three consecutive homers since Jim Thome, Albert Belle, and Julio Franco accomplish the feat on September 12, . Broussard, Martínez, Hafner and Gerut all homer in the ninth inning as the Indians match their team record for home runs in one game, previously accomplished at Milwaukee on April 25, . Cleveland also sets a new Safeco Field HR record, surpassing the six homers hit by the Kansas City Royals in . The major league record for home runs in a game is 10, set by the Toronto Blue Jays in .
* July 16 – With his solo home run in the eighth inning of the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; 5-1 victory over the New York Mets, Bobby Abreu joins Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds and Barry Bonds by reaching the elite 20-homers/20-steal plateau for a sixth consecutive season. This quartet is the only group of players to have six consecutive 20-20 seasons in major league history. Abreu also becomes the only member of the quartet with no family connection to Barry, his late father Bobby, or his godfather Willie.
* July 23 – At Fenway Park, Kevin Millar becomes the third player to hit three home runs in a Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees game, joining Lou Gehrig () and Mo Vaughn (). Despite Millar&#x27;s effort, the Yankees edge the Sox 8-7.
* July 24 – In a Red Sox 11-10 win over the Yankees, also at Fenway Park, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Varitek begin a bench-clearing brawl after Rodriguez was hit by a Bronson Arroyo pitch. Gabe Kapler and Tanyon Sturtze break into the fight, giving Sturtze a bloody ear.
* July 29 – New York Mets outfielder Eric Valent becomes the eighth player in Mets history to hit for the cycle to lead his team to a 10-1 victory over the Montreal Expos at Olympic Stadium. Valent goes 4 for 4 with a walk, drives in three runs and scores three times in becoming the fourth player in the majors this season to hit a single, double, triple, and home run in a game – joining Milwaukee&#x27;s Chad Moeller, Pittsburgh&#x27;s Daryle Ward, and Philadelphia&#x27;s David Bell.
* July 30 – The Pittsburgh Pirates obtain OF/IF José Bautista from the New York Mets. Bautista becomes the 10th major leaguer to play for four teams in a season. He begins the year with Baltimore and also plays with Tampa Bay and Kansas City, in addition to Pittsburgh. The last to do so was Dan Miceli (2003). Before him, the four-in-one players were Frank Huelsman (1904), Willis Hudlin (1940), Paul Lehner (1951), Ted Gray (1955), Wes Covington (1961), Mike Kilkenny (1972), Dave Kingman (1977) and Dave Martinez (2000). Bautista is technically on five teams, because he is acquired by New York from Kansas City but is sent to Pittsburgh the same day.
* July 31 – The Boston Red Sox send five-time All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to the Chicago Cubs in a four-team deal that highlights clubs beating baseball&#x27;s trade deadline. Montreal Expos shortstop Orlando Cabrera, Cubs shortstop Alex S. Gonzalez and Minnesota Twins first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz also move in the four-way trade. The Red Sox wind up with Cabrera and Mientkiewicz, both Gold Glovers; the Cubs get Garciaparra and minor league outfielder Matt Murton; Montreal acquires Gonzalez, pitcher Francis Beltrán and infielder Brendan Harris, and the Twins get minor league pitcher Justin Jones.

Mark McGwire hit three homers in his first year with the Oakland Athletics, and 30 or more in the next four seasons. Pujols also becomes the first Cardinal in the franchise&#x27;s 112-year history to hit 30 or more home runs in four consecutive years.

* August 8 – At Comerica Park, the Boston Red Sox outslug the Detroit Tigers 11-9, despite knuckleballer Tim Wakefield giving up a record-tying six home runs. Wakefield becomes the sixth pitcher since 1900 to yield six homers in a game, but the first since George Caster of the Philadelphia Athletics against the Red Sox on September 24, . The others are Larry Benton (New York Giants, 1930), Sloppy Thurston (Brooklyn Dodgers, 1932), Bill Kerksieck (Philadelphia Phillies, 1939) and Al Thomas (St. Louis Browns, 1936). Both teams combine for 10 homers. For Boston, Kevin Youkilis homers twice and David Ortiz belts one. For Detroit, Iván Rodríguez and Eric Munson each connect twice, and one each to Carlos Peña, Dmitri Young and Craig Monroe.

* August 10 – At Great American Ball Park, Adam Dunn of the Cincinnati Reds hits the first home run ever to land in another state. Against José Lima of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Dunn hits a ball that exits the ballpark in center field and bounces onto Mehring Way, which runs between GABP and the Ohio River. The ball then bounces onto a piece of driftwood in the river, which is considered Kentucky territory. Despite Dunn&#x27;s blast, which is measured at 535 feet (to date, the longest in the stadium&#x27;s history), the Dodgers defeat the Reds 4-2.
* August 11 – Randy Wolf homers twice and throws seven solid innings to lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 15-4 victory over Colorado. Wolf, who has four career homers, goes 3-for-3 and scored three runs.

* August 17 – Mark Teixeira becomes the second player in Texas Rangers history – and the first in more than 19 years – to hit for the cycle, leading Texas to a 16-4 rout of the visiting Cleveland Indians. He goes 4-for-5 and drives in a career-high seven runs for the club&#x27;s first cycle since Oddibe McDowell accomplished the feat on July 23, , against the Indians at Arlington Stadium. Teixeira is the fifth player to hit for the cycle this season.
* August 25 – The Cuban team defeats the Australia team, 6–2, in the final of the 2004 Summer Olympics Baseball tournament.
* August 26 – At Safeco Field, the Seattle Mariners&#x27; Ichiro Suzuki belts a leadoff home run in the ninth inning for his 200th hit in 2004, reaching the mark in fewer games than any player since .

<doc id="949263" wikidata="Q11827976" url="?curid=949263" title="Stele (biology)">
<text>In a vascular plant, the stele is the central part of the root or stem containing the tissues derived from the procambium. These include vascular tissue, in some cases ground tissue (pith) and a pericycle, which, if present, defines the outermost boundary of the stele. Outside the stele lies the endodermis, which is the innermost cell layer of the cortex.

The concept of the stele was developed in the late 19th century by French botanists P. E. L. van Tieghem and H. Doultion as a model for understanding the relationship between the shoot and root, and for discussing the evolution of vascular plant morphology. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, plant molecular biologists are coming to understand the genetics and developmental pathways that govern tissue patterns in the stele. Moreover, physiologists are examining how the anatomy (sizes and shapes) of different steles affect the function of organs.

==Protostele==
The earliest vascular plants had stems with a central core of vascular tissue. This consisted of a cylindrical strand of xylem, surrounded by a region of phloem. Around the vascular tissue there might have been an endodermis that regulated the flow of water into and out of the vascular system. Such an arrangement is termed a protostele.

There are usually three basic types of protostele:
* haplostele – consisting of a cylindrical core of xylem surrounded by a ring of phloem. An endodermis generally surrounds the stele. A centrarch (protoxylem in the center of a metaxylem cylinder) haplostele is prevalent in members of the rhyniophyte grade, such as &quot;Rhynia&quot;.
* actinostele – a variation of the protostele in which the core is lobed or fluted. This stele is found in many species of club moss (&quot;Lycopodium&quot; and related genera). Actinosteles are typically exarch (protoxylem external to the metaxylem) and consist of several to many patches of protoxylem at the tips of the lobes of the metaxylem. Exarch protosteles are a defining characteristic of the lycophyte lineage.
* plectostele – a protostele in which plate-like regions of xylem appear in transverse section surrounded by phloem tissue, thus appearing to form alternating bands. These discrete plates are interconnected in longitudinal section. Some modern club mosses have plectosteles in their stems. The plectostele may be derived from the actinostele.

==Siphonostele==

Siphonosteles have a central region of ground tissue called the pith, with the vascular strand comprising a hollow cylinder surrounding the pith. Siphonosteles often have interruptions in the vascular strand where leaves (typically megaphylls) originate (called leaf gaps).

Siphonosteles can be called &quot;ectophloic&quot; (phloem present only external to the xylem) or they can be &quot;amphiphloic&quot; (with phloem both external and internal to the xylem). Among living plants, many ferns and some Asterid flowering plants have an amphiphloic stele.

An amphiphloic siphonostele can be called a &quot;solenostele&quot;, or this term may be used to refer to cases where the cylinder of vascular tissue contains no more than one leaf gap in any transverse section (i.e. has non-overlapping leaf gaps). This type of stele is primarily found in fern stems today. Where there are large overlapping leaf gaps (so that multiple gaps in the vascular cylinder exist in any one transverse section), the term &quot;dictyostele&quot; may be used. The numerous leaf gaps and leaf traces give a dictyostele the appearance of many isolated islands of xylem surrounded by phloem. Each of the apparently isolated units of a dictyostele that serve a single leaf can be called a &quot;meristele&quot;. Among living plants, this type of stele is found only in the stems of ferns.

Most seed plant stems possess a vascular arrangement which has been interpreted as a derived siphonostele, and is called a &quot;eustele&quot; – in this arrangement, the primary vascular tissue consists of vascular bundles, usually in one or two rings around the pith. In addition to being found in stems, the eustele appears in the roots of monocot flowering plants. The vascular bundles in a eustele can be collateral (with the phloem on only one side of the xylem) or bicollateral (with phloem on both sides of the xylem, as in some Solanaceae).

There is also a variant of the eustele found in monocots like maize and rye. The variation has numerous scattered bundles in the stem and is called an &quot;atactostele&quot; (characteristic of monocot stems). However, it is really just a variant of the eustele.

<text>Soccer Kid is a 1993 side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Krisalis Software in Europe for the Amiga. The player assumes the role of the titular main protagonist who travels across several countries around the world to repair the World Cup by retrieving pieces that were scattered by the alien pirate Scab, the main antagonist who failed to steal and add it to his trophy collection in a robbery attempt. Its gameplay mainly consists of platforming and exploration elements, with a main single-button or two-button configuration, depending on the controls setup.

Conceived by Dean Lester, &quot;Soccer Kid&quot; was created by most of the same team who previously worked on the &quot;Manchester United&quot; franchise at Krisalis Software and uses the same game engine as with &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, another title made by the developer. After making multiple association football titles, the team experimented with creating a project that fused both football and platform game elements in 1992, developing a physics engine dedicated to the soccer ball that proved to be successful internally. Initially released for the Amiga platform, the title was later ported to other home computers and consoles including the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Amiga CD32, Atari Jaguar, Game Boy Advance, MS-DOS, PlayStation and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, each one featuring several changes and additions compared to the original version. Conversions for multiple systems were also in development but never released.

Since its original release on the Amiga, &quot;Soccer Kid&quot; garnered positive reception from critics who praised multiple aspects such as the presentation, visuals, original gameplay concept and replay value, while some felt divided in regards to the difficulty and sound design, with others criticized some of the repetitive set pieces later in the game. The Super Nintendo version received a more mixed reception from reviewers who felt divided with the graphics, sound design and gameplay. The DOS conversion, although mixed, got a critical response similar to the original Amiga version for its visuals, sound and gameplay. The CD32 port was well received by critics and the 3DO port got mostly positive reviews. The Jaguar port was received with mixed opinions from reviewers who criticized and felt that it did not improve the graphics and audio from the 16-bit versions, while the Game Boy Advance release was received with a more warm reception.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Soccer Kid&quot; is a platform game where players take control of the titular character travelling across the world to retrieve and restore the world cup from the clutches of the alien pirate Scab, who plans to add it to his ever-growing collection. By pressing different buttons at the title screen, the player can change the colours of their character&#x27;s clothes to represent their favorite team. Each country has three levels that the player must navigate through.

The player character can perform various types of soccer moves such as runs, shots, bicycle kicks, headers and other sorts of moves to either advance in the level, get to hard-to-reach areas or eliminate enemies by using his soccer ball as the main tool. The player starts out with two hearts but by opening random chests scattered throughout the game, they can get more hearts. At the end of each third level, the player must fight a boss, based on stereotypical people associated with their respective country. However, the player must always explore each level to find soccer cards, which are crucial to getting the cup at the end of the game.

Once a country is completed and all the cards in that country are collected, Soccer Kid is transported to a bonus level where he must collect all the food against limited time for a piece of the cup to be obtainable. If all heart pieces are lost, the player character is respawned on a determined checkpoint after losing a life and once all lives are lost, the game is over, though there is an option of continuing. Depending on the version being played, progress is saved differently.

== Development ==

&quot;Soccer Kid&quot; was created by most of the same personnel who worked on the &quot;Manchester United&quot; series including programmer Peter Harrap, who co-wrote the title alongside Nigel Little, artist Neil Adamson and composer Matt Furniss, among other team members that shared multiple roles during its development process, while the overall concept was conceived by Dean Lester, in addition to also sharing the same game engine as with &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, another platform game by Krisalis. Development of the project began in February 1992, when Krisalis co-founder Tony Kavanagh announced their plans for it early in the year and the team wanted to experiment in making a title that mixed football and platforming elements after developing several association football titles. Nigel stated that to assure such project would be playable, the team wrote a primitive physics engine early in its development and implemented real-life rules for the ball to react realistically, which would eventually prove to be feasible after multiple testing phases.

&quot;Soccer Kid&quot; was previewed across several video game magazines early in development under the title &quot;Football Kid&quot;, featuring different visuals compared with the final release, which were improved from its original incarnation, while some publications compared it with &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; due to its gameplay structure and console-style presentation. The game runs at 50 frames per second, while sprites were made as 64x64 pixel objects. It was originally intended to be released in November 1992 but due to the interest in porting the title to home consoles, the title was moved to next year and faced constant delays prior to its eventual launch. The name of the project was also changed to appeal to consumers when porting across other platforms.

== Release ==
&quot;Soccer Kid&quot; was first showcased to attendees of Spring ECTS &#x27;93 and it was first released for the Amiga in Europe in June 1993, featuring support with the Amiga 1200 for enhanced visuals, while almost all future conversions of the game were developed internally at Krisalis Software and each one features several changes and additions when compared with the original Amiga version. The first console port to be released was the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which was first released in Japan by Yanoman Corporation before being published on western regions by Ocean Software in 1994. In North America, this port was renamed to &quot;The Adventures of Kid Kleets&quot;, and in Japan this port was renamed to &quot;Great Soccer Kid&quot;. In France, the Super Nintendo version was going to be released as a licensed game based on &quot;Moero! Top Striker&quot;, known in France as &quot;L&#x27;École des champions&quot;, but this version was never released. During the same year, it was ported to MS-DOS and only released in western regions.

An Amiga CD32 was also developed and published by Krisalis in 1994 featuring mostly the same improved visuals when playing on Amiga 1200, a brand new level that was cut from the original version due to space constrains, as well as a new animated opening sequence created by a Japanese animation studio. A 3DO port developed by Team17 and published by Studio 3DO was first released in North America on 2 May 1994, and later in Japan on 9 December using the name &quot;Great Soccer Kid&quot; like the Super Nintendo version. The port features redrawn artwork and sports a different GUI. A port of &quot;Soccer Kid&quot; for the Atari Jaguar was announced in early 1994 after Krisalis was signed to be a third-party developer by Atari Corporation for the system in September 1993, which was originally intended to be published by Ocean on a scheduled Q2 1995 release date, but was never released during the official life span of the Jaguar on the market and went almost unreleased after Atari discontinued the system, until it was eventually picked up for release on 7 February 2000 by independent developer and publisher Songbird Productions. This version of the game features similar visuals to those of the original Amiga version, albeit with an improved color palette and a new UI.

A Windows Mobile conversion of &quot;Soccer Kid&quot; was released worldwide on 4 April 2002. Several months later, the game was converted to the Game Boy Advance and published by Telegames after being showcased to the public at E3 2002, featuring enhanced visual effects but a lower resolution display. Krisalis later ported the GBA version to PlayStation and was only released in Europe by Telegames on 13 December 2003, becoming both the last version of the game to be officially released and the final version developed by the original team. A version of &quot;Soccer Kid&quot; for the Atari ST was being developed by Krisalis and was also previewed under its earlier title, &quot;Football Kid&quot;, by &quot;ST Review&quot; magazine on their September 1992 issue, but was never released on the platform for unknown reasons. A Sega Mega Drive version was reviewed by Spanish magazine &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot;, but the Mega Drive version was never released. Likewise, an Atari Lynx conversion of the game was also planned to be published by Telegames, but was never released as well.

== Reception ==
&quot;Amiga Power&quot; gave the Amiga version a score of 88% with a review by Stuart Campbell. He criticized the player character&#x27;s moves as being too &quot;fiddly&quot;, but praised the graphics and particularly the &quot;fearsome&quot; difficulty, saying it gave the game good value for money. He compared the game to the acclaimed &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, saying it was even better due to the superior control and greater focus on platform action.

The 3DO version received a 6.2 out of 10 from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. They praised the &quot;technique&quot; and &quot;excellent graphics&quot;, but said the sound effects were lacking. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a positive review, citing smooth controls, strong sound effects, good variety of musical tracks, and exceptional graphics.

Reviewing the 3DO version, &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Shawn Sackenheim called &quot;Soccer Kid&quot; an &quot;impressive&quot; action/platformer that manages to be different as well.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the 3DO version of the game, and said that aside to its confusing plot, it did not brought anything new to platform genre.

<doc id="949276" wikidata="Q5304099" url="?curid=949276" title="Dr. Franken">
<text>Dr. Franken is a platform game released in 1992 for the Game Boy and in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Elite Systems. It was titled The Adventures of Dr. Franken for the SNES in the United States. The game features Franky, a Frankenstein&#x27;s monster on a mission to collect the scattered body parts of his girlfriend, Bitsy.

A Mega Drive version was planned but never released. Versions for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Gear reached prototype stage, but were also not released. A Game Boy sequel, &quot;Dr. Franken II&quot;, was published in 1993.

==Gameplay==

The game consists of seven floors (20 stages in various places of the world in the SNES version) where various items and parts of Bitsy (Franky&#x27;s girlfriend) are hidden. Keys and special items are needed to access additional areas to find more body parts and equipment required to resurrect Bitsy. The Game Boy release of the game uses a password-based saving system to save the player&#x27;s progress.

==Music==
The Game Boy and unreleased NES versions of the game use two classical music pieces throughout. The title screen music is Bach&#x27;s Fugue No. 2 In C Minor BWV 847 (The Well Tempered Clavier in C), and the gameplay music is Beethoven&#x27;s Moonlight Sonata. The Game Boy and NES versions&#x27; music was arranged by Mark Cooksey. He composed the music in C-Lab Notator for the Atari ST.

==Reception==
==Legacy==
Franky also appeared in the 1993 Game Boy puzzle game &quot;Franky, Joe &amp; Dirk: On the Tiles&quot;, along with Joe from &quot;Joe &amp; Mac&quot; and Dirk the Daring from &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;. &quot;Dr. Franken II&quot; is a sequel to the original and was released for the Game Boy in 1997. It was developed by MotiveTime and published by Jaleco. It is a platform game in which the lead character, Franky, must escape the castle in which he is trapped in order to search for pieces of a gold tablet which will help him to stave off debt.

<doc id="949278" wikidata="Q2473951" url="?curid=949278" title="The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends (video game)">
<text>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends is a video game released by THQ between 1992 and 1993 for Game Boy, NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis adapted from &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; TV series.

==Plot==
In the NES version, Bullwinkle learns that his ancestor left sums of money for him to collect. Rocky and Bullwinkle need to go through perilous levels that feature their enemies Boris and Natasha, before they could reach the home of the moose&#x27;s ancestor.

In the Genesis, SNES, and Game Boy versions, three artifacts are stolen from a museum. It is up to Rocky and Bullwinkle to get them back.

==Gameplay==
The NES version includes a countryside house, a futuristic city, a train, a desert, and a mansion. The player can switch between Rocky and Bullwinkle during a game. Bullwinkle can ram into enemies while Rocky can fly. Both characters can hurl bombs at foes.

The Genesis and SNES versions consist of seven levels that take players through various locales: A Swiss Alps-style mountain, a cavern, a mine, a submarine, a haunted ship, a port town, and a castle. Instead of bombs, the title characters hurl mooseberries and acorns at enemies. Mini-games are available at certain points that allows players to collect extra lives. The mini-games are &quot;Peabody and Sherman&quot;, where players control Sherman and blow bubble gum bubbles to clog a dragon&#x27;s mouth, and &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot;, where players ride a horse and avoid an ever-approaching train which is driven by Snidely Whiplash.

The Game Boy version only has three levels, although generally with multiple sections. The first level, Frostbite Falls, has the player control Bullwinkle. The second, on the Moon, uses Rocky, and the final one, the Abominable Manor, uses Bullwinkle again. Before the final section, a bonus level that has Bullwinkle running to the end of a football field to catch Rocky, avoiding and head-butting football players on the way, can grant the player an extra life upon completion. The final section has a time limit to defeat the Fearless Leader and rescue your friend. Dying three times sends the player back to the first section of the level. Despite the absence thereof, the game label still showed the &quot;Friends&quot; (e.g. Dudley Do-Right).

The Game Boy version&#x27;s level design was later reused for &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Space Cadet Adventures&quot; (also developed by Imagineering).

==Reception==

Reception varied among its differing versions. The NES version received mostly negative reviews for its poor graphics and music, while reception for the SNES and Genesis versions were mixed. When reviewing the NES version, &quot;GamePro&quot; stated that the slow-paced action may not appeal to experienced NES players but the absence of continues may provide an interesting challenge. The reviewer also stated that fans of the TV series might play the game for nostalgic reasons.

<doc id="949280" wikidata="Q2020509" url="?curid=949280" title="Adventures of Yogi Bear">
<text>Adventures of Yogi Bear is a platform game published by Cybersoft on October 1, 1994, in North America and later in Japan and Europe. The game is called Yogi Bear in Japan, Yogi Bear&#x27;s: Cartoon Capers for the European Super NES version, and Yogi Bear Cartoon Capers for the Mega Drive version.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Adventures of Yogi Bear&quot; is a platform game in which the player controls Yogi Bear and must progress through five levels representing Yogi&#x27;s home, Jellystone Park. Jellystone Park must not be turned into a chemical dumping zone; only Yogi can prevent that from happening.

The player must navigate through various climate zones (including tundra, swamps, and grasslands) in order to retrieve the picnic baskets. Collecting 100 time clocks allow players to receive an additional life. Enemies in the game include bats, skunks, weasels, ghosts, and other assorted baddies.

Players can also ride on mine carts and participate in surfing while using a beaver for a makeshift surfboard.

==Reception==
Reviewing the SNES version, &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that &quot;Adventures of Yogi Bear&quot; is too easy and simplistic to appeal to experienced gamers, but that its pleasant atmosphere and lush graphics would make it enjoyable for novice players. Similarly, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the &quot;cute&quot; graphics and sound effects, criticized the simplistic gameplay, and concluded that &quot;younger kids will probably take to this game faster than older players will.&quot; They gave the game a 6.2 out of 10.

<text>Anthony Gilbert was the pen name of Lucy Beatrice Malleson (15 February 1899 – 9 December 1973), an English crime writer and a cousin of actor-screenwriter Miles Malleson. She also wrote fiction and a 1940 autobiography, &quot;Three-a-Penny&quot;, as Anne Meredith.

==Biography==

Lucy Malleson was born in London. When her stockbroker father lost his job the family suffered financial hardship, and she took up shorthand typing to earn a living. She began writing poetry, and then, inspired by the play &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; by John Willard (1922), she tried her hand at detective novels, using the name J. Kilmeny Keith. The first was &quot;The Man Who Was London&quot;, published in 1925. She published over sixty crime novels as Anthony Gilbert, most of which featured her best-known character, Arthur Crook. Crook is a vulgar London lawyer totally (and deliberately) unlike the sophisticated detectives, such as Lord Peter Wimsey and Philo Vance, who dominated the mystery field when Gilbert introduced him. Instead of dispassionately analysing a case, he usually enters it after seemingly damning evidence has built up against his client, then conducts a no-holds-barred investigation of doubtful ethics to clear him or her. As fellow mystery author Michael Gilbert noted, &quot;...he behaved in a way which befitted his name and would not have been approved by the Law Society.&quot; The first Crook novel, &quot;Murder by Experts&quot;, was published in 1936 and was immediately popular. The last Crook novel, &quot;A Nice Little Killing&quot;, was published in 1974.

==Adaptations==

Her novel &quot;The Vanishing Corpse&quot; (1941) was adapted as the film &quot;They Met in the Dark&quot; (1943), another novel, &quot;The Mouse Who Wouldn&#x27;t Play Ball&quot; (1943) was filmed as &quot;Candles at Nine&quot; in 1944, and her novel on abduction and a faked identity, &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;, which features Arthur Crook and his assistant Bill Parsons (1941), was adapted as the 1945 film noir, &quot;My Name Is Julia Ross.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll Be the Death of Me,&quot; an October 1963 episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour,&quot; was adapted from Gilbert&#x27;s short story &quot;The Goldfish Button&quot; in the February 1958 &quot;Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine&quot;. Her short stories &quot;Door to a Different World&quot; and &quot;Fifty Years After&quot; were Edgar Award nominees.

The 1942 novel &quot;Something Nasty in the Woodshed&quot; (American title &quot;Mystery in the Woodshed&quot;) was adapted for stage by Dennis Hoey as &quot;The Haven,&quot; opening in New York in 1946. Crook was played by Melville Cooper. The production received poor reviews and lasted only five performances.

==Revival==

While Malleson&#x27;s books sold well enough to keep publishers asking for more, she was never a best-seller. However, in 2017 interest in her was revived through the reissue of the Anne Meredith crime novel &quot;Portrait of a Murderer&quot; under the British Library&#x27;s Crime Classics imprint. Martin Edwards believes this novel to be &quot;a major departure. Dostoevsky was her model, although Anthony Berkeley&#x27;s influence was also in play.&quot; Although quickly forgotten in 1933 it did win the praise of Dorothy L Sayers. The reissue sold many more copies than the original edition, and was followed by a reissue of the 1933 Anthony Gilbert novel, &quot;Death in Fancy Dress&quot;, as well as the Anne Meredith autobiography &quot;Three-a-Penny&quot; in December 2019. The title of the latter was taken from a remark made to her by Sayers: &quot;Although authors are three-a-penny to us, they are quite exciting to other people.&quot; &quot;Three-a-Penny&quot; was also serialised on BBC Radio 4. The book also paints a vivid portrait of poverty between the wars in the East End of London.

<text>Aero Fighters, known as in Japan, is a vertically scrolling shooter originally released in arcades in 1992 by Video System and was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. It was the first in the &quot;Aero Fighters&quot; series, and a spiritual successor to the 1991 &quot;Turbo Force&quot;.

== Gameplay ==

This game uses basic shooter mechanics of the SHMUP genre of video games. Pressing button 1 fires normal weapons; this can be upgraded by collecting P or the rare F items, though the maximum power level has a hidden ammo count, after which the player will return to the previous power level. Pressing button 2 launches a powerful special attack; uses are limited to how many B items the player has collected (every life starts with two). Some ground enemies will drop score items when destroyed; they appear as the currency of the selected character&#x27;s nation. By default, players start with three lives, and can acquire one more at 200,000 points.

&quot;Aero Fighters&quot; is famous for its large cast of characters, unheard of in 1992. Each pair of characters represents one of four nations. The two-player sides may only select the four characters given (one for each nation). In a two-player game, only a single nation can be chosen.

The game has seven stages divided into two parts. The first three stages are selected randomly from a group of four, with one for each character&#x27;s nation; however, a character will never go to its nation&#x27;s stage. The other four stages are fixed. After beating all seven stages, the player sees the character&#x27;s ending, then play much more difficult versions of those stages, after which the game truly ends.

In the Super Nintendo version, a special code can be used to play with the spaceship from &quot;Rabio Lepus&quot;.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Aero Fighters&quot; on their May 1, 1992 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the month. &quot;RePlay&quot; also reported the game to be the second most-popular arcade game at the time. Despite being a solid entry, the arcade version had little to distinguish itself from the competition. One critic wrote: &quot;&quot;Aero Fighters&quot; is a thoroughly solid game, let&#x27;s get that out of the way. It is also a game that is easy to forget. At a time when shooters were a dime a dozen it didn&#x27;t exactly stand out.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Super NES version a negative review, saying the weapons are imaginative but the game suffers from slowdown, mediocre graphics, weak sound effects, and &quot;monotonous&quot; music, concluding that &quot;&quot;Aero Fighters&quot;&#x27; action won&#x27;t stay with you - it&#x27;s a temporary thrill that eventually retreats to the hanger.&quot;

==Legacy==
An emulated version of the game was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Japan-exclusive &quot;Oretachi Gēsen Zoku&quot; series. In 2022, the original arcade version was included as part of the Sega Astro City Mini V, a vertically-oriented variant of the Sega Astro City mini console. Copies of the game are rare, with astronomical prices on auction sites. In December 2023, the game was later released for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series.

===Sequels===
Shin Nakamura, the main designer of &quot;Aero Fighters&quot; and a number of other Video System games, disliked the company&#x27;s plan to start developing on the Neo Geo. He wanted to make more vertical games like &quot;Aero Fighters&quot;, but found it difficult to do so on a horizontal monitor. He and other like-minded employees left to found Psikyo, with the similar &quot;Samurai Aces&quot; being their first game.

McO&#x27;River would never publish another title under that name. Back at Video System, meanwhile, other employees teamed up with the remaining &quot;Aero Fighters&quot; staff to begin work on sequels. &quot;Aero Fighters 2&quot; and &quot;Aero Fighters 3&quot; were released for the Neo Geo. &quot;Sonic Wings Special&quot;, a sort of &quot;dream match&quot; game based on the three previous entries, was released for the Sega Saturn and later for the PlayStation. Soon after, &quot;Special&quot; was reworked for the arcades into &quot;Sonic Wings Limited&quot;. In 1997, &quot;McO&#x27;River, Inc.&quot; changed its name to &quot;Video System U.S.A., Inc.&quot; A year later, Paradigm Entertainment developed &quot;Aero Fighters Assault&quot; for Video System. &quot;Sonic Wings Special&quot; and &quot;Limited&quot; were both made for a vertical monitor like the first game. Similarly, Nakamura would make &quot;Strikers 1945 Plus&quot; for the Neo Geo a few years later.

In November 2024, a new game in the Aero Fighters series was announced, called &quot;Sonic Wings Reunion&quot;. The launch date is May 29, 2025 in Japan, and the supported platforms are PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and arcades.

==In popular culture==
YouTuber and author John Green, having come across the game in the Savannah Airport, mistakenly read the title as &quot;Nerd Fighters&quot; while filming a video addressing his brother Hank Green on the popular YouTube channel Vlogbrothers on February 17, 2007. &quot;Nerdfighters&quot; and &quot;Nerdfighteria&quot; eventually became the collective title of the Vlogbrothers&#x27; fan community. In September 2013, he was given an &quot;Aero Fighters&quot; arcade cabinet as a gift.

<text>Aero the Acro-Bat is a 1993 video game developed by Iguana Entertainment and published by Sunsoft. It was released for both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis. Aero the Acro-Bat, a red anthropomorphic bat, was created by David Siller. In 2002, Metro 3D released a version of the game for the Game Boy Advance, with a battery back-up (which the original versions lacked). The GBA version was titled &quot;Aero The Acro-Bat - Rascal Rival Revenge&quot; in Europe and in Japan. The Super NES version of the game was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in the PAL region and North America in July 2010. In 2024, the Super NES version was re-released in August for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S, alongside a new localization in Japanese made by Shinyuden as for the Nintendo Switch users in Japan, while the GBA version was re-released for the same platforms in November.

A sequel, &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat 2&quot;, was released in 1994, followed by the spin-off &quot;Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel&quot;.

==Plot==
A spoiled, rich kid named Edgar Ektor was a regular attendant at The World of Amusement Circus and Funpark, but was banned after a failed prank almost killed a lion. 20 years later, Edgar became a powerful and evil industrialist. Aided by Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel and his Psycho Circus gang, Edgar sabotages the funpark and kidnaps all the circus performers. Aero the Acro-Bat is the circus&#x27; greatest star and the only hope for rescuing the performers (including his girlfriend Aeriel) and putting a stop to Edgar&#x27;s evil schemes.

==Gameplay==
The levels are played in typical 2D platforming style. In order to clear them, the player must accomplish certain tasks so that the exit warp can be revealed. Those tasks include passing through hoops, stepping on platforms until they disappear, riding roller coasters, etc. There are four worlds with five levels in each one, and the levels are large, many of them containing awkwardly positioned spikes that kill instantly.

Aero can attack enemies by shooting limited stars or by doing an aerial diagonal drill attack at his target when he is in the air.

If enough points are collected at the end of a level, a bonus level can be played, in which Aero has to dive into a pool. The bonus level is a vertical platform level in the Genesis version. When Sunsoft converted the game for the Super NES they changed the bonus level to utilise Mode 7 as a straightforward level to maneuver above an overworld map.

== Development ==
For many years David Siller had ideas for the game&#x27;s character in his head. He first sketched the concept of Aero in 1992. Although Aero&#x27;s early designs resemble a human acrobat, Siller always intended him to be a bat. The gameplay mechanics were partly based on Namco’s &quot;Mappy&quot; series. By this time, Siller had agreed to join Sunsoft of America.

The final concept was designed by David&#x27;s son Justin Siller, who was inspired by mixed themes from the 70s and 80s. Some of the enemies, items and in-levels that Siller proposed never made it in the finished game. The concept included a mission objective feature, which was not added in the original release, but it was implemented and modified in the Game Boy Advance version. Originally &quot;Aero&quot; was going to be released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System, but by this time 16-bit consoles were on the market, so the NES version was cancelled. Much of the game&#x27;s work took place at Orange County, California. Both the Super NES and Genesis versions were being worked on simultaneously, but the Genesis version was released earlier as the Super NES version reached its final stages of development.

Plans were made by Sunsoft to port the game to Atari Jaguar sometime in 1994, but this version was never released.

After the success of the sequels, Siller left Sunsoft and joined Universal Interactive. Universal bought the rights of Siller&#x27;s character and were intent on making Aero their mascot. He had intended to start up a sequel to the second game titled &quot;Aero the Acrobat 3D&quot; to be released on PlayStation to complete the series as a trilogy, but this concept never reached development, as Universal turned their attention to &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;. Following the success of that game, Crash was their official mascot instead of Aero. With no success in starting a new Acro-Bat game, Siller bought back Aero as he left Universal. While Siller worked at Capcom, the USA Bill Gardner wanted to make use of Aero, but the Japanese HQ denied that request in accordance to Siller&#x27;s contract.

By summer 2002, Siller had to relocate to Texas. He did not have the funds to form his own studio, but was able to hire Atomic Planet to port his original game to the Game Boy Advance. Metro 3D found the game very promising for marketing and Siller directed the port during its development. In addition Siller wanted to port the two sequels &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat 2&quot; and &quot;Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel&quot; on Game Boy Advance in near future and compile them in a collection called &quot;A-Z Force&quot;, but he cancelled those plans in favor of designing original games.

==Release==
Promotional artwork of the game was shown at 1993 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Nevada as well as the prototype version at the 1993 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where it stood out well above other exhibits. Aero the Acro-Bat was made Sunsoft&#x27;s new mascot. By late 1993, Sunsoft was giving away free copies of the Super NES or Genesis version of the game to the first 100 people that sent them a 3x5 postcard to their address.

Ratalaika Games re-released &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat&quot; for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on August 2, 2024.

==Reception==

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Super NES version an 8.3 out of 10 and the Genesis version a 7.6 out of 10. They criticized the absence of the exceptionally good music of the Super NES version but held it to still be an excellent game with its large, challenging levels. They also awarded &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat&quot; Best New Character of 1993. &quot;NintendoLife&quot; gave the Virtual Console release of the Super NES version a 6 out of 10.

Four reviewers in &quot;GameFan&quot; gave the Genesis version 93, 97, 87, and 90 &quot;Video Games: The Ultimate Gaming Magazine&quot; gave both the Genesis and SNES versions 8 out of 10.

Conversely, &quot;Digital Press&quot; gave the game only 3 out of 10.

<doc id="949297" wikidata="Q2629633" url="?curid=949297" title="Aero the Acro-Bat 2">
<text>is a platform game developed by Iguana Entertainment, and published by Sunsoft as the sequel of &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat&quot;. It was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1994 and then for Sega Genesis in January 1995. The game is dedicated to Brazilian racer Ayrton Senna, who died in a crash during a Grand Prix.

David Siller planned to port and remake the game for Game Boy Advance in 2002, but then cancelled it in favor of original titles. The Super NES version was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in the PAL region on August 6, 2010, and in North America on September 20. Ratalaika Games re-released the game in September 2024 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

==Plot==
The story starts directly after the events of the original game, where Aero had knocked Edgar Ektor off of the highest tower of his Museum of Horrors. After knocking him off, Aero leaves to explore Ektor&#x27;s museum, finding a magician&#x27;s box which brings him to an ancient castle. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Aero, Ektor&#x27;s henchman Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel manages to save him before he hits the ground, and Ektor tells Zero to prepare a &#x27;Plan B&#x27;.

==Gameplay==
The game is split into eight worlds, all of them except for the final world with three &#x27;acts&#x27; each. The levels are significantly longer than the first game and they are designed in a similar way with many secret areas. There are no objectives, as well as a timer. The goal of each level is to find the exit at the end of every act, defeating enemies and collecting power-ups along the way.

Aero keeps his drill jump from the first game, an ability that can be aimed either diagonally up or down to reach enemies and platforms. New to this game is the ability to aim the drill jump straight down, allowing Aero to attack enemies directly below him. Food can be collected for extra points, and stars can be thrown at enemies to defeat them, much like in the original game. There are also four hidden letters in each act that spell the word &#x27;AERO&#x27;. Finding all four letters will unlock a cup-switching game (it can also be played in the Options Menu) at the end of the act where an extra life can be earned.

==Development==
Sunsoft made use of SGI technology to render the backgrounds of the game.

==Release==
The game was shown at 1994 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago.

Sunsoft aided by the Spanish company Spaco released the game in Spain along with &quot;Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel&quot; and &quot;Hebereke&#x27;s Popoon&quot; for Christmas 1994.

==Reception==

Reviewing the Genesis version, &quot;GamePro&quot; raved that &quot;&quot;Aero 2&quot; outclasses the original with a new, dark theme that shows off some truly superb graphics, new and improved moves and techniques, and better play control&quot;. They also praised the game&#x27;s huge levels and numerous secrets, and singled out the Drop Drill as the best of the new moves. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; described it as a solid and satisfying sequel to the original, citing good graphics, numerous techniques, large levels, and ingeniously designed secret areas. They gave it a 7.75 out of 10. &quot;Next Generation&quot; concurred that the graphics, levels, and techniques all add up to very solid gaming, but criticized both Aero games for being severely lacking in originality.

&quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the Virtual Console release of the Super NES version an 8 out of 10, declaring it &quot;a much more varied and playable platforming experience&quot; than the original &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat&quot;. They specifically noted the improved controls and graphics and the more varied level designs and musical tracks, and added that the game is &quot;every bit as much fun to play now on the Virtual Console service as it was fifteen years ago on the Super Nintendo console&quot;.

<text>Aerobiz Supersonic, known as in Japan, is a business simulation video game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Koei in North America in August 1994. It was later ported to the Genesis. It is a sequel to Koei&#x27;s previous airline simulation game, &quot;Aerobiz&quot;.

==Gameplay==

In the game, which is somewhat similar to its predecessor, the player is the CEO of a start-up international airline. The player competes with three other such companies (either AI-controlled or other players) for dominance in the worldwide travel industry. Such dominance is obtained by purchasing slots in various airports around the world, and flying routes to and from those slots. Once a route is created, the player has control of what type of planes fly the route, the price of airfare, and numerous other variables. The winning conditions for the player&#x27;s airline are evaluated at the end of each year. These are to have a regional hub in every region, have the highest passenger total of all airlines during the given year in four to seven regions (depending on difficulty level), one of which must be the player&#x27;s home region, and have a profit during the given year.

The game includes numerous historical events that can help or hinder airline performance. Four different eras of play are available for the player to choose. They include 1955–1975 (which depicts the dawn of jet airplanes), 1970–1990 (which depicts a period of instability, oil crises, and the end of the Cold War), 1985–2005 (which depicts the present day of economic prosperity and relative stable peace), and 2000–2020 (which depicts the replacement of jet planes with supersonic airplanes, the European Union extending to Russia, and countries trying to get airlines to fund alternative fuel research). This futuristic era was chosen by SG and Koei to be illustrated by San Francisco illustrator Marc Ericksen for the packaging art, showing two executives conferring over a holographic aircraft design in a futuristic airline terminal.

Airlines must be able to achieve the goals assigned to them within 20 years; only one airline can achieve this victory with no draws permitted. If none of the airlines can achieve the goal, then all airlines lose because stalemates are not permitted at the end of the game. Tiebreakers are also not permitted because games are not usually designed to be in ties at the end of the 20-year contest. In the rare instance that all airlines go bankrupt simultaneously, then all airlines would also lose.

==Events==
===Historical events===
The simulation includes numerous historical events, including:
* Summer Olympic Games accurate up to Sydney 2000. The 1976 Summer Olympics were in Montreal, although the game has them in Toronto.
* The downfall of colonialism
* The ejection of Singapore from Malaysia
* The rise of Fidel Castro (1959)
* The Suez Crisis
* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971
* The Yom Kippur War
* An international oil crisis (1973)
* The Iran–Iraq War
* Operation Desert Storm
* Perestroika
* The destruction of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany
* Fall of the Soviet Union
* The retrocession of Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* The growth of the European Union

===Hypothetical events===
The simulation also includes hypothetical events, including:
* After 2000, the Summer Olympics start occurring in random selection of the game&#x27;s major cities.
* Ukraine joining the European Union in July 1998.
* Belarus joining the European Union in January 1999.
* Switzerland joining the European Union in July 2003.
* Russia joining the European Union in October 2005.
* Civil war in random cities at random times (although in the game, they often occur in Lima, Peru, which had a civil war in real time).
* The introduction and quick obsolescence of commercial supersonic aircraft (2007–2016).
* Global oil crisis in the mid-late 2010s.
* The nations of the world asking the airlines for money to find alternatives to fossil fuels.
* A volcanic eruption in New Zealand.
* Floods in Thailand and Vancouver, Canada (both events corresponding with global climate change).
* An earthquake in São Paulo.

==Major players in the game==
===Eastern Bloc===
From the beginning of the game until 1986, the Eastern Bloc countries are stuck with tense relations with Western Europe, North America, and countries in the British Commonwealth. In particular, their worst-possible relationship with the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan means airlines located in the Eastern Bloc cannot buy from the big American planemakers of the time, Boeing, Lockheed, and McDonnell-Douglas. However, they have normal-excellent relations with African countries, Middle Eastern countries, countries in Central America, South America, and some Asian countries. Furthermore, relations with France are decent enough that Eastern Bloc companies can buy from countries based there like Airbus and Sud Aviation, though at a markup. Airplanes from Eastern Bloc countries are, in general, represented as undersized and inefficient gas-guzzlers that can only do medium-range flights as their longest routes, but their base cost is cheaper and they can perform certain specialty roles well.

After perestroika in 1986, airlines from these countries can purchase airplanes from the United States thanks to normalization of relations. These airplanes become even cheaper following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in 1989-1991. In the game&#x27;s hypothetical then-future scenario (2000-2020) Russia enters the EU in 2005, making Airbus prices cheaper. Ilyushin and Tupolev airplanes remain very cheap and become more efficient than earlier models.

===Western Bloc===
====Western Europe====
With normal-tense relations with Eastern European countries until around 1985, airlines that are headquartered in Western European countries must either purchase cheap airplanes from the &quot;local&quot; market or order slightly more expensive planes from the United States of America. After Perestroika, they can purchase from any plane manufacturing company. Joining the European Union in the mid-1990s makes airplanes cheaper or more expensive depending on relations with the United States prior to the founding of the EU.

====North America====
North America&#x27;s situation in the game is identical to the situation found by Western European countries. The only difference is that planes from American companies are cheaper than planes from Western European countries. Since North America has a higher tourism rating than Europe until the 1990s, North America–based airlines can afford more airplanes and routes for a better risk-profit potential than European-based airlines.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China and other countries===
Normalized relations with both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. allows all planes to be purchased by airlines headquartered in the People&#x27;s Republic of China regardless of the year. However, improving relations with either country will reduce the price of the airplanes - giving the player a choice of acquiring either inefficient Soviet-made planes or efficient American-made planes at bargain prices. Like the People&#x27;s Republic of China, countries that are not strongly affiliated with either NATO or Warsaw Pact may purchase from any manufacturer as long as relations are not tense (red). Relations with the country must be at least normal (orange) in order to purchase airplanes from that country.

==Reception==
&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Super NES version a 7.2 out of 10, deeming it a different type of game that is more geared towards to strategy. They gave the later Genesis version a 6.6 out of 10 and opined that Koei managed to make a unique strategy game while also being entertaining.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the Genesis version of the game three stars out of five, and said that sim fans will be pleased with the level of detail in the game.

&quot;VideoGames&quot; selected it as a runner-up for 1994&#x27;s Best Strategy Game award, which was won by &quot;Equinox&quot;.

<doc id="949301" wikidata="Q4873227" url="?curid=949301" title="Battleship Cove">
<text>Battleship Cove is a nonprofit maritime museum and war memorial in Fall River, Massachusetts, United States. Featuring the world&#x27;s largest collection of World War II-era naval vessels, it is home to the highly-decorated battleship . It is located at the heart of the waterfront at the confluence of the Taunton River and Mount Hope Bay and lies partially beneath the Braga Bridge and adjacent to Fall River Heritage State Park.

The memorial traces its origins to the wartime crew of &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, who fought to save it from being broken up and ensure its preservation as a museum ship.

The battleship forms a small cove which serves as a protected harbor for pleasure craft during the summer months. The Fall River Yacht Club maintains a dock nearby. The site also contains the historic 1920 Lincoln Park Carousel made by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, PTC #54, originally located at Lincoln Park in nearby North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, restored by local vocational high school students and installed in a new pavilion in the early 1990s. A fairground organ provides the carousel&#x27;s music. The type of organ is unknown, but it plays Wurlitzer 150 rolls.

==History==
Formally registered as the U.S.S. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; Memorial Committee, Inc., Battleship Cove was incorporated as a nonprofit educational organization and granted §501(c)(3) status by the Internal Revenue Service in 1964. Led by veterans who had served aboard &quot;Massachusetts&quot; during World War II, the group was responsible for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s donation of the decommissioned vessel and its subsequent public display.

In its first year open to the public, more than 250,000 visitors explored the ship. Soon after, the battleship was recognized as the official memorial to Massachusetts citizens who gave their lives in World War II and her interior spaces were reconfigured to accommodate exhibits.

===Expansion===
In 1972, , a World War II-era , joined the battleship for public display. Also that year, the Nautical Nights overnight camping program commenced as a model program, enrolling more than 500,000 youths to date. The following year, , a , was added to the fleet and immediately designated as the Commonwealth’s official memorial to the Korean and Vietnam Wars. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was subsequently designated the Commonwealth&#x27;s official memorial to veterans of the Gulf War.

Soon after the arrival of the USS &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;, the Mayor of Fall River christened the site “Battleship Cove”. In 1975 Tin Can Sailors, Inc., a national organization of 24,000 destroyer veterans, was founded at Battleship Cove.

In 1984 a North American T-28 Trojan was added. This aircraft served as a US trainer, and also served in the VNAF Republic of Vietnam Air Force, reflecting immigrants in the Commonwealth who had served in the Vietnamese armed forces. A new gift shop helped fuel the organization’s growth. In 1985, the Commonwealth awarded a $2.5 million grant for the preservation of &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;, and in that same year the National Park Service designated &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;Lionfish&quot;, and &quot;PT-796&quot; as National Historic Landmarks (NHL). Subsequently, both &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; and &quot;PT-617&quot; received NHL status, giving Battleship Cove the highest concentration of such south of Boston. Comprising eight vessels, the Battleship Cove fleet is the largest and most diverse collection of historic naval ships in the world.

In the 1990s the organization continued to improve with over sixty new exhibitions related to the historic ships and veterans. The success of the overnight program, high visitation from school groups, and general admissions supported an expanded staff and improved ship maintenance efforts. On June 14, 1997, the Cove acquired a Cold War relic: the Soviet-built East German Navy missile corvette . Three years later, the Commonwealth awarded &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Lionfish&quot; a $10 million grant for significant, dry-dock restoration work.

Since 1964, Battleship Cove has hosted more than 5 million youth, veterans, and tourists. As goals for continued success as an educational, historical museum, the Cove is dedicated to expanding and sustaining its outreach with programs like the Battleship Cove Community Boating Program, the Raytheon Inspiring Technological Exploration (RITE) Program, and the Veterans’ Voices Oral History Program

==Exhibits==
===USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot;===
The largest vessel in the Battleship Cove fleet, the battleship , is the centerpiece of the collection. Known as &quot;Big Mamie&quot; to her crewmembers during World War II, she was the seventh ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the sixth state. Her keel was laid down 20 July 1939 at the Fore River Shipyard of Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 23 September 1941 sponsored by Mrs. Charles Francis Adams III, and commissioned on 12 May 1942 at Boston, Massachusetts, with Captain Francis E. M. Whiting in command.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; received eleven battle stars for World War II service and earned a reputation as a &quot;Work Horse of the Fleet&quot;. During World War II, no United States Navy personnel were killed in action while aboard &quot;Massachusetts&quot;. It is said that &quot;Big Mamie&quot; fired both the first US Navy shells of World War II (at the Vichy French battleship in the Naval Battle of Casablanca during Operation Torch); and the last (at a Japanese steel works at Hamamatsu), hours before the war ended.

USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot; is one of eight United States battleships of the many that were produced in the first half of the 20th century remaining as museum ships.

===USS &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;===


USS &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; (DD-850) is a &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyer of the United States Navy. The ship was named after Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., a naval aviator, son of the former Ambassador to Britain Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and older brother of future President John F. Kennedy. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; is on display as a museum ship in Fall River, Massachusetts. Among the highlights of its service are the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the afloat recovery teams for Gemini 6 and Gemini 7. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; was decommissioned in 1973, and brought to Battleship Cove the following year.

In the spring of 2000, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; was brought to Rhode Island Sound for the movie &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, portraying both herself and .

===USS &quot;Lionfish&quot;===

USS &quot;Lionfish&quot; (SS-298), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy named for the lionfish, a scorpaenoid fish found in the West Indies and the tropical Pacific. After completing her shakedown cruise off New England, she began her first war patrol in Japanese waters on 1 April 1945. Ten days later, she dodged two torpedoes fired by a Japanese submarine and on 1 May destroyed a Japanese schooner with her deck gun. After a rendezvous with the submarine , she transported B-29 survivors to Saipan and then made her way to Midway Island for replenishment.

On 2 June she started her second war patrol, and on 10 July fired torpedoes at a surfaced Japanese submarine, after which &quot;Lionfish&quot;″s crew heard explosions and observed smoke through their periscope. She subsequently fired on two more Japanese submarines and ended her second and last war patrol performing lifeguard duty (the rescue of downed fliers) off the coast of Japan. When hostilities ended on 15 August she headed for San Francisco and was decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard on 16 January 1946.

&quot;Lionfish&quot; was recommissioned on 31 January 1951, and headed for the East Coast for training cruises. After participating in NATO exercises and a Mediterranean cruise, she returned to the East Coast and was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 15 December 1953.

In 1960, the submarine was called to duty again, this time serving as a reserve training submarine at Providence, Rhode Island. In 1971, she was stricken from the &quot;Navy Register&quot;, and in 1973, she was unveiled for permanent display as a memorial at Battleship Cove, where she has evolved into one of the museum’s most popular exhibits and a monument to all submariners.

===&quot;Hiddensee&quot;===

Originally commissioned by the East German Navy as &quot;Rudolf Egelhofer&quot;, &quot;Hiddensee&quot; was a built at the Petrovsky Shipyard in 1984, located near the former Soviet (now Russian) city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). An example of a Soviet-built missile corvette, &quot;Hiddensee&quot; was designed to oppose any naval threat to the East German coast, and to fulfill this mission carried long-range Styx anti-ship missiles and an array of defensive weapons designed to ensure her own survival.

Following the reunification of Germany, &quot;Hiddensee&quot; served with the Federal German Navy until her decommissioning in April 1991. Shortly thereafter she was reactivated and transferred to the U.S. Navy. Joined briefly by a crew of 20 former East German sailors, a small civilian U.S. crew conducted extensive testing with the vessel at the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Solomons, Maryland facility in the Patuxent River. After 50 underway deployments in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes areas, Navy budget cutbacks severely curtailed operations, but she continued on as a research vessel until April 1996.

&quot;Hiddensee&quot; joined the Battleship Cove fleet in Fall River on June 14, 1997, where she spent 26 years. During her time there, she was moored on the port side of &quot;Lionfish&quot;. &quot;Hiddensee&quot; was closed to the public after December 2021 following a gangway collapse. Due to a lack of funding, Battleship Cove was unable to maintain her and quietly sold her for scrap in October 2023. 

===PT boats===
&quot;PT-796&quot; was acquired 1975, followed in 1984 by &quot;PT-617&quot;, forming the only pair of restored PT boats on display in the world. &quot;PT-617&quot; is the only remaining Elco PT boat on display similar to that of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;PT-109&quot;.

===USS &quot;Fall River&quot;===

USS &quot;Fall River&quot; (CA-131) was a heavy cruiser launched 13 1944. In 1946 she participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests in the Marshall Islands, followed by a short tour of duty in the Far East in 1947, after which she was placed out of commission in reserve at the Puget Sound Navy Yard.

The tip of her bow is now on display at Battleship Cove.

<text>Hugh Wilson McKee (April 23, 1844 – June 11, 1871) was an American naval officer in the 1870s who participated in the United States expedition to Korea in 1871.

==Early life and military service==
McKee was born in Lexington, Kentucky to a military family. His father, William R. McKee, was a US Army colonel who had been killed in action commanding the Second Kentucky Regiment in the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican–American War.

Hugh McKee was appointed to the Naval Academy September 25, 1861 and graduated in 1866. His early duty stations included service in the Practice Squadron and aboard the USS &quot;Rhode Island&quot;, flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron. In 1867–1869, he was assigned to the steam frigate &quot;Franklin&quot; and steam sloop of war &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, both operating in European waters. McKee was promoted to ensign in March 1868.

==United States expedition to Korea==
McKee had attained the rank of lieutenant by March 1870, and was serving in the Asiatic Squadron as an officer of the USS &quot;Colorado&quot;. He was mortally wounded June 11, 1871, while leading a company of bluejackets over the walls of a Korean fort on Ganghwa Island close by the Inchon beaches during the United States expedition to Korea. Fifteen sailors and Marines received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle including William F. Lukes, Alexander McKenzie, Samuel F. Rogers, and William Troy, who attempted to save McKee, as well as Frederick Franklin, who assumed command of McKee&#x27;s company until relieved.

McKee died on board the USS &quot;Monocacy&quot; at 5:45 p.m. that afternoon and his body was sent to his ship, the &quot;Colorado&quot;, the next day. His remains were later sent to Shanghai and from there to the United States. He was interred at Lexington Cemetery. He never married and had no descendants. Three ships of the U.S. Navy have been named USS &quot;McKee&quot; in his honor.

<text>BBC Midlands Today is the BBC&#x27;s regional television news service for the West Midlands. It was launched in 1964 and is presented by Nicola Beckford, Joanne Malin, Mary Rhodes, Nick Owen, Elizabeth Glinka, Rebecca Wood and Shefali Oza.

==Overview==
&quot;Midlands Today&quot; is produced by BBC Midlands and broadcasts on BBC One seven days a week. The programme is produced and broadcast from the BBC studios in The Mailbox, Birmingham. Journalists are also based at newsrooms in Coventry, Shrewsbury, Stoke-on-Trent, Worcester and Gloucester.

The programme began on 28 September 1964, broadcasting from a small room in the Birmingham Register Office before moving to the custom-built Pebble Mill broadcasting centre in Edgbaston on 10 November 1971. It remained there until the studios closed on 22 October 2004 when the BBC Birmingham operations were switched to the current studios at The Mailbox.

Until 1991, the programme also served the East Midlands, which has since received its own BBC regional TV news programme, &quot;East Midlands Today&quot;. The programme&#x27;s editorial area consists of the West Midlands, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and northern Gloucestershire (even though Gloucestershire is not formally within the Midlands, being in the South West England region – it is also covered by BBC Points West).

&quot;Midlands Today&quot; is broadcast from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter in the West Midlands and can be watched in any part of the UK on Sky, Freesat and in the rest of Europe via Astra 2E at 28.2° East (10788V 22000 5/6). The latest edition is also available to view again on the &quot;Midlands Today&quot; website and on BBC iPlayer.

Freeview viewers in northern Staffordshire around Kidsgrove and Biddulph cannot receive signal from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter; instead, they receive better signal from the Winter Hill transmitter that broadcasts &quot;North West Tonight&quot; from Salford. However, those areas can still watch &quot;Midlands Today&quot; on Channel 101, which broadcasts the BBC One West Midlands variant on Sky and Freesat by default.

Even though viewers in northern Oxfordshire around Banbury are served by &quot;South Today&quot;, the town can also receive &quot;Midlands Today&quot; from a local relay transmitter that is transmitted from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter. 

Viewers in North West Leicestershire and Swadlincote in Derbyshire receive &quot;Midlands Today&quot; on Freeview as local news meaning those areas receive better signals from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter rather than Waltham transmitter.

Eastern parts of the Powys area in Wales, such as Presteigne, cannot receive signals from the Carmel transmitter; instead, they get better signals from the Ridge Hill transmitter, which broadcasts &quot;Midlands Today&quot;.

On 6 February 2023, a new studio upgrade was revealed resembling that of Studio B at Broadcasting House launched in June 2022 to include a whole new studio presentation, enhanced graphics and additional presentation locations within the studio. The upgrade brings the studio up to full HD capabilities for the first time.

==On air==
On weekdays, 6 breakfast bulletins air as part of &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; around every 30 minutes, between 6:26am and 9:06am.A fifteen-minute lunchtime bulletin airs at 1:30pm, following the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;. The main edition of &quot;Midlands Today&quot; is broadcast every weeknight between 6.30pm and 7.00pm.The late night bulletin airs at 10.30pm on weeknights, following the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;.

&quot;Midlands Today&quot; also airs short early evening bulletins on Saturday and Sunday evenings, although times usually vary. A late night bulletin is also broadcast on Sundays, following the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;.

==Presenters==

==Past presenters==
Former presenters have included Tom Coyne (presented the first episode from Pebble Mill studios in 1971), Kay Alexander (the programme&#x27;s longest serving presenter), Alan Towers (see below), Alastair Yates, David Davies, Richard Uridge, Sue Beardsmore (left to become the public space coordinator at The Mailbox), Nina Nannar (moved to ITN in 2001), Stuart Linnell, Matt Smith, Julian Worricker, Ashley Blake (who was sacked in August 2009 after a criminal court case), Suzanne Virdee (who abruptly left in 2012 after an undisclosed row with management), Steve Clamp (moved to Central ITV in 2005) and Jackie Kabler who is now a regular presenter on QVC UK. Olympic Gold medalist Denise Lewis also guest presented sport briefly during 2005, as did Rob Curling in 2002.

Senior presenter Alan Towers&#x27; on-air departure in July 1997 (after 25 years) brought about one of the most controversial moments in the programme&#x27;s history when he shared indignant views on BBC management, describing them as &quot;pygmies in grey suits wearing blindfolds&quot;.

<doc id="949331" wikidata="Q5135780" url="?curid=949331" title="Cloudstreet">
<text>Cloudstreet is a novel by Australian writer Tim Winton published in 1991. It chronicles the lives of two working-class families, the Pickles and the Lambs, who come to live together in a large house called Cloudstreet in Perth, Western Australia, over a period of twenty years, 1943 to 1963. The novel received several awards, including a Miles Franklin Award in 1992, and has been adapted into various forms, including a stage play and a television miniseries.

In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Plot summary==
In 1943, precipitated by separate personal tragedies, two poor families, the Lambs and the Pickles, flee their rural homes to share a large house called Cloudstreet in Perth, Western Australia. The Pickles include the father, Sam, the mother, Dolly, and their three children, Ted, Rose, and Chub. The Lambs are led by father, Lester, and mother, Oriel, and they have six children, Hattie, Elaine, Mason (nicknamed &quot;Quick&quot;), Samson (nicknamed “Fish”), Red and Lon. The Pickles own Cloudstreet, but rent half of the house to the Lambs, who open a grocery store on the ground floor of the house. The two families contrast each other; the devoutly religious Lambs find meaning in hard work and God&#x27;s grace, while the Pickles hope for good luck and do not share the Lambs&#x27; appetite for hard work. The novel focuses on the experiences and relationships of these two families over a period of 20 years.

==Major themes==
The novel is a celebration of community and people&#x27;s search for connection with family, the past, and the environment in which they live. The novel also explores several Australian cultural myths, including the idealisation of the Aussie battler, the heroic figure of the ANZAC, rural and suburban identity, and the idea of Australia as &quot;the lucky country&quot;. Peter Garrett also noted the importance of landscapes in the book: &quot;he writes about the physicality of our landscapes and whether it&#x27;s sort of, you know, railway cuttings, or bits of the desert, or the coast, or the estuaries where they go fishing occasionally, and he casts that landscape across the top of the lives that people are leading and their emotional landscapes are sort of contrasting against the landscapes of things they&#x27;re doing at different times&quot;.

==Historical context==
&quot;Cloudstreet&quot; is framed by many key events in world history, including World War II, the Korean War and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Winton depicts Australia at this time as, for the most part, comfortable and conservative, characterised by backyard barbecues, by wives – who were no longer needed for the war effort – consigned to the home, and by the growth of the Australian dream. World events influence the Lambs and Pickles, but distantly, like an echo that sends ripples across the surface of their lives. The novel focuses on the domestic, and this serves as the filter through which history is measured. The most prominent historical character within &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; is the &quot;Nedlands monster&quot;, whose real name is Eric Edgar Cooke, a serial killer. The Australian Dictionary of Biography writes that Winton&#x27;s novel &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; embodied the social impact of Cooke&#x27;s crimes, which saw a change in personal and household security and a loss of a relaxed style of living.

== Critical reception ==
The novel has received positive reviews. Australian writer Marion Halligan praised Winton&#x27;s prose, deeming it &quot;full of energy, vitality, [and] wit&quot;. Writer Mem Fox stated &quot;If you have not read &quot;Cloudstreet&quot;, your life is diminished . . . if you have not met these characters, this generous community, these tragedies, the humour. It is so wonderful.&quot; In his introduction to the 2013 Folio Society edition, Australian writer Alex Miller calls it &quot;Australia&#x27;s most iconic novel&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest acts of the human imagination of the late twentieth century&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
&quot;Cloudstreet&quot; was the recipient of the National Book Council Banjo Award for Fiction, the Western Australian Fiction Award and the Deo Gloria Award in 1991, and a Miles Franklin Award in 1992. In 2003, members of the Australian Society of Authors (ASA) voted &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; as their favourite Australian novel. The same year, &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; came out on top in a readers&#x27; poll organised by the ASA and ABC Radio National. &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; was the &quot;overwhelming favourite&quot; in the 2010 &quot;&quot;ABR&quot; Favourite Australian Novel&quot; poll conducted by the &quot;Australian Book Review,&quot; and in 2012, viewers of &quot;First Tuesday Book Club&quot; voted &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; #1 on a list of &quot;10 Aussie Books You Must Read Before You Die&quot;. On 5 November 2019, &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Cloudstreet&quot; has been adapted into various forms: 

* Paige Gibbs adapted the book into a radio play in 1996 for ABC Radio National. 

* In 1998, the novel was adapted into a stage play by Nick Enright and Justin Monjo, which opened in Sydney in January 1998 under the direction of Neil Armfield, produced by Company B and Black Swan Theatre for the Sydney Festival, and published by Currency Press. The play won several awards, including an AWGIE Award in 1999, and the Helpmann Award for Best Play and Helpmann Award for Best Direction of a Play in 2002. In 2019 and 2020, the play was revived in a Black Swan State Theatre Company and Malthouse Theatre co-production under the direction of Matthew Lutton, staged from February 21 to March 15, 2020 at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre as a part of Perth Festival. 

* A three-part television miniseries was made for the Showcase subscription television channel, which first screened from 22 May 2011. 

* In May 2016, an operatic version with music by George Palmer was premiered in Adelaide by the State Opera of South Australia.
* In June 2023 a three part radio version was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

<text>Donald MacNeil Fairfax (March 10, 1818 – January 10, 1894) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Early life and family==
The son of George William Fairfax, and Isabella McNeill, grandson of Ferdinando Fairfax, and great-grandson of Bryan Fairfax, he was born at Mount Eagle, Virginia. Fairfax entered the Navy as a midshipman on August 12, 1837. His younger brother, Edwin Cary Fairfax (1833-1912), also served in the Union Army, enlisting in the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry, Company D.

On November 8, 1861, Fairfax boarded &quot;Trent&quot; to remove Confederate commissioners James M. Mason and John Slidell, after the ship had been stopped by his captain, Charles Wilkes.

Wilkes had given Fairfax the following written instructions:
Fairfax demanded the passenger list, but Mason and Slidell identified themselves. He escorted Mason by the collar, to the cutter, and with two officers took hold of Slidell from the main cabin. He failed to claim &quot;Trent&quot; as a prize, citing the loss of manpower of a prize crew (avoiding a worse incident).

<text>Air Rhodesia was the national airline of Rhodesia. Its head office was located on the property of Salisbury Airport in Salisbury.

The airline was formed as a subsidiary of Central African Airways (CAA) in June 1964, but became an independent corporation on 1 September 1967. It flew internal routes to Buffalo Range, Bulawayo, Fort Victoria, Kariba, and Victoria Falls. During the 1970s, it operated international flights to Johannesburg and Durban in South Africa; Beira, Vilanculos and Lourenço Marques in Mozambique; and Blantyre in Malawi.

Air Rhodesia&#x27;s mainstay aircraft were Vickers Viscount 700D turboprops and Boeing 720 jetliners, three of which were successfully purchased in April 1973 despite sanctions against the Rhodesian government. After the country was renamed, the airline became known as Air Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, before reforming as Air Zimbabwe in 1980.

==History==
===Central African Airways===
Central African Airways (CAA) was formed on 1 June 1946 as the joint airline of Southern Rhodesia (later Rhodesia; now Zimbabwe), Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Nyasaland (now Malawi), the governments of the three countries owning 50%, 35% and 15% of the airline&#x27;s share capital respectively. CAA began operating with a mixture of former Rhodesian Air Services (RAS) aircraft, but soon took delivery of five De Havilland Doves and three Vickers VC.1 Vikings. Services were steadily expanded to cover a route network that extended as far north as Nairobi in Kenya, and as far south as Johannesburg in South Africa, also serving destinations such as Blantyre in Malawi to the east, and Maun in Bechuanaland (now Botswana) to the west. In August 1948, CAA inaugurated Africa&#x27;s first air freight service.
By 1954, CAA had expanded to cover routes as far afield as London in the UK. The federation that joined the three shareholders of CAA was dissolved in 1963, and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland prepared to attain their independence the following year, to become Zambia and Malawi respectively. The two new countries expressed a wish to operate their own airlines but this was not straightforward because CAA&#x27;s core operations were mostly based in Southern Rhodesia, including the engineering base, stores and most of the infrastructure and personnel that were needed to support the airline; only minor repairs to the aircraft could be attempted away from the Salisbury base. A settlement was agreed in December 1963, which provided at least a temporary solution to the problem: CAA would remain in existence but it would be responsible to a higher authority consisting of transport ministers from the three separate governments. Independent subsidiaries of CAA were formed to operate in the three countries: Air Malawi Ltd, based in Blantyre; Zambia Airways Ltd, based in Lusaka; and Air Rhodesia (Pvt) Ltd, based in Salisbury. The administrative arrangements that operated between the three companies proved to be successful and profitable for all three. On 11 November 1965, the Rhodesian Government formalised the Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain, and sanctions were imposed on Rhodesia shortly afterwards by Britain and independent African states, including Malawi and Zambia; this closed down almost all international flights operating through Rhodesia, with the exception of Portugal&#x27;s TAP Air and South African Airways. Relations between the three sister companies became strained and a split was agreed in 1967.

===Air Rhodesia Corporation===

Air Rhodesia Corporation came into being on 1 September 1967 while Rhodesia was under international isolation. Unlike Zambia, Malawi maintained &quot;cool&quot; relations with Air Rhodesia Corporation, and as a result, flights between Salisbury and Blantyre were maintained and soon increased; Air Rhodesia posted a profit in its first year of operation. The aircraft were then repainted in a livery consisting of a white top side, with dark blue and light blue &quot;cheatlines&quot; on the fuselage sides; sloping dark blue and light blue stripes also appeared on the vertical fin. The controversial &quot;twiggi bird&quot;, a highly stylised representation of the Zimbabwe Bird, the national emblem of Zimbabwe (then-named Rhodesia), was superimposed on the two fin stripes. This was criticised in some circles as being scarcely recognisable as a Zimbabwe Bird, and it was even likened to an Arab dhow under sail.

===1973–1978: The Jet Age===

Air Rhodesia&#x27;s profits increased between 1969 and 1970, and the airline continued to perform well despite the challenges brought about by sanctions and the deteriorating political environment within Rhodesia. Passenger services were introduced to Kariba; the Dakota services to Wankie were upgraded to use the Viscount; and additional revenue was earned by lending surplus aircrew to other airlines. However, Air Rhodesia&#x27;s performance was affected when its competitors began to use new jet airliners, and it became obvious that jet aircraft were essential for international services. The airline covertly acquired its first jets, three Boeing 720-025 jetliners, which arrived under a shroud of secrecy on the evening of 14 April 1973 during the Easter holiday; they had initially been purchased new by the original Eastern Air Lines, a U.S. air carrier based in Miami, and had then been acquired by Calair, a German charter airline that folded in 1972. Air Rhodesia&#x27;s new jet planes were ready to be put into service in November 1973, just as fuel prices increased by 35 percent because of the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East. Soon afterwards, the Bush War began to escalate sharply, and staff shortages due to military call-ups were adding to the airline&#x27;s difficulties. Mozambique was granted its independence in 1975, and Air Rhodesia services to Blantyre and Beira were banned in March 1976 when Rhodesian aircraft were prohibited from overflying Mozambican territory. Until 1979, the airline&#x27;s only external services would be to Johannesburg and Durban.

===The Bush War===

On 3 September 1978, Air Rhodesia Flight 825, a Vickers Viscount with registration VP-WAS, was shot down near Kariba by nationalist guerrillas. Only eight people survived the crash and the ensuing massacre by the guerilla fighters. Just five months later, on 12 February 1979, Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another Viscount, registered VP-YND, was shot down in the same area, killing everyone on board. As a protective measure, all of the surviving Air Rhodesia Viscounts were quickly painted in a special yellowish-green matte paint, and all shiny metal surfaces on the aircraft, including propeller blades and spinners, were painted over. In order to prevent heat-seeking missiles from locking on to the hot jet pipes, specially designed engine guards were fitted to the engine nacelles, which had the effect of significantly increasing the aircraft&#x27;s fuel consumption. Meanwhile, due to the ongoing war, passenger numbers continued to plummet as fuel prices soared.

===1979: Air Zimbabwe Rhodesia===
When Rhodesia achieved democracy as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, Air Rhodesia became &quot;Air Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot;. In anticipation of the new political truce bringing about stability and new opportunities, Air Zimbabwe Rhodesia ordered construction of a large new hangar in 1979. Thoughts immediately turned to reopening routes to destinations long closed to the airline as a result of sanctions.

===1980–2012: Air Zimbabwe===
After independence in Zimbabwe, Air Zimbabwe Rhodesia was renamed &quot;Air Zimbabwe&quot;, which went bankrupt in 2012 before being resurrected in 2013.

<text>The Neglinnaya (), also known as Neglinka, Neglinna, Neglimna (Неглинка, Неглинна, Неглимна), is a 7.5 km underground river in the central part of Moscow and a tributary of the river Moskva. It flows in the tunnels under Samotechnaya Street, Tsvetnoy Boulevard, Neglinnaya Street and Alexander Garden and Zaryadye. The Neglinnaya discharges into the Moskva through two separate tunnels near Bolshoy Kamenny Bridge and Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge.

==History==
The river in its natural state used to flow openly from the northern parts of Moscow to the south across the very centre of the city. The Kremlin was built on a hill east of the Neglinnaya, using the river as a moat. The moat did not stop foreign invasions but slowed development of territories west of the Kremlin; initially, the city grew eastward, into Red Square and Kitay-gorod. When Muscovites began settling on the western side, territories around the Neglinnaya remained vacant due to frequent flooding.

Muscovites constructed a number of dams, creating a chain of six interconnected ponds, used for firefighting, with watermills, forges, workshops and public baths (Moscow&#x27;s two best-known public baths, Central and Sandunоvskie, built in 1890s, are still located on Neglinnaya Street). There were four bridges across the Neglinnaya River: Voskresensky Bridge (its fragments unearthed during a 1994 excavation), three-span Kuznetsky Bridge, Trinity Bridge and Petrovsky Bridge (the remains of the last were discovered during the reconstruction of the Maly Theatre).

The first plans to rebuild the Neglinnaya River, presented in 1775, materialized in 1792. A new masonry canal, one sazhen (2.13 m) wide, was laid parallel to the Neglinnaya; after diverting water into the channel, builders filled the old river bed with earth. After the Fire of Moscow (1812), the canal was so polluted that the city cleared it and covered with a masonry vault, creating the first Neglinnaya Tunnel (1817-1819), which also formed present-day Neglinnaya Street and Theatre Square. Before centralised city sewage (1887), the tunnel doubled as a sewer, dumping the refuse into the Moskva River.

The first reconstruction (1910—1914) replaced part of the tunnel with a larger pipe, but was terminated by World War I. This new pipe, designed by engineer Schekotov (&quot;Schekotov Tunnel&quot;), was adequate by any standard, and could suffice, if completed in full length. Narrow cross-section of old pipe, however, could not accommodate the volume of water, especially during high water and freshets, flooding central streets; the most recent catastrophic floods occurred in 1965 (twice) and 1973 (also twice).

In 1966, the city built a second arm for the Neglinnaya River (length: 1 km, width: 4 m), cutting the path under Zaryadye. In 1974–1989, after the 1973 flood, the city built a completely-new 4 km tunnel, 3.47 m high and 4.90 m wide, from Durova Street to Metropol Hotel (where the tunnel forks into two branches). The old tunnel was reused as a pipe and cable conduit.

Present-day ponds on Manezhnaya Square (1996) are not the Neglinnaya River but an imitation. The real river runs too deep to be properly displayed. The area is dotted with diminutive statues on subjects taken from Russian fables designed by Zurab Tsereteli.

<text>In the politics of the United Kingdom, a National Government is a coalition of some or all of the major political parties. In a historical sense, it refers primarily to the governments of Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain which held office from 1931 until 1940.

The all-party coalitions of H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George in the First World War were sometimes referred to as National Governments at the time, but are now more commonly called Coalition Governments. The term &quot;National Government&quot; was chosen to dissociate itself from negative connotations of the earlier coalitions. Similarly the all-party government of Winston Churchill in the Second World War was generally referred to as the National Government at the time.

==Crisis of 1931==

The Wall Street crash of 1929 heralded the global Great Depression and Britain was hit, although not as badly as most countries. The government was trying to achieve several different, contradictory objectives: trying to maintain Britain&#x27;s economic position by maintaining the pound on the gold standard, balancing the budget, and providing assistance and relief to tackle unemployment. The gold standard meant that British prices were higher than its competitors&#x27;, so the important export industries did poorly.

In 1931, the situation deteriorated and there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was borne out by the independent May Report which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The Labour government agreed in principle to make changes in taxation and to cut expenditure to balance the budget and restore confidence. However, the Cabinet could not agree on the two options available: either introduce tariffs (taxes on imports) or make 20% cuts in unemployment benefit. In the end, MacDonald and Snowden drafted a proposal that would cut benefits by 10%. Trade unions rejected this proposal. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11–9 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as Arthur Henderson and George Lansbury, threatening to resign rather than agree. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign.

The financial crisis grew worse and decisive government action was needed as the leaders of both the Conservative and Liberal Parties met with King George V, and MacDonald, at first to discuss support for the measures to be taken but later to discuss the shape of the next government. MacDonald had originally wished to tender his resignation but was told to re-consider by the King on the grounds that the majority of opposition MPs and the country at large supported the cuts proposed by the May Report, even if the Labour Party and the Trade Unions led by Ernest Bevin did not. MacDonald duly changed his mind during the night and met with the Conservative and Liberal MPs the following morning. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed and formed a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called &quot;National Labour&quot;) who stood with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin and Chamberlain) and two Liberals. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into the general election on 27 October against the three-party National coalition.

==Early days==

The Government was initially applauded by most, but the Labour Party were left in a state of confusion with the loss of several of their most prominent figures, and MacDonald, Philip Snowden and James Henry Thomas did little to explain themselves, with the result that the Labour Party soon swung fully against the government. This was in part because of the Trade Unions&#x27; decision to oppose all forms of cuts proposed by MacDonald and Snowden in response to the May Report, which had concluded the UK government needed to curb government expenditure to reduce the budget deficit amid the fallout from the Great Depression that began in 1929. The May Report in particular recommended to MacDonald that his Labour government cut unemployment benefit by 20%. The Trade Unions that represented a large proportion of the Labour party&#x27;s base refused to support any cuts to benefits or wages except to &quot;the salaries of Ministers&quot;. Efforts to bring public expenditure cuts produced further problems, including a mutiny in the Royal Navy over pay cuts (the Invergordon Mutiny), with the result that the pound sterling came under renewed pressure, and the government was forced to take the radical step of taking the pound off the gold standard altogether.

Debate then broke out about further steps to tackle the economic problems. At the same time the Labour Party officially expelled all of its members who supported the National Government, including MacDonald. Increasingly, the majority of the Cabinet came to believe that a protective tariff was necessary to support British industry and provide revenue and that a general election should be fought to secure a mandate but this was anathema to the Liberal Party. The Liberals&#x27; acting leader and Home Secretary, Sir Herbert Samuel, fought in Cabinet against an election but found the Liberal Party dividing in several directions over the course of action. One group, under Sir John Simon emerged as the Liberal Nationals, was prepared to accept the tariff and expressed willingness to take the place of the main Liberals in the government. The party&#x27;s official leader, David Lloyd George was incapacitated at this time but called for the Liberals to abandon the government altogether and stand independently in defence of free trade, but his call was heeded only by four other MPs, all of whom were his close relatives.

It was eventually agreed that the government as a whole would seek a &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Mandate&quot; to take a free hand and that each party would issue its own manifesto. Supporters of MacDonald formed the National Labour Organisation and the parties agreed to allow their local organisations to agree whether or not to oppose each other. The government was opposed by the Labour Party, Lloyd George and his Liberals and the New Party of Sir Oswald Mosley. Within the parties there was particular conflict between the Conservatives and Liberals. The 1931 general election campaign run by the National Government figures stressed their policies would aim to avoid any risk of Britain seeing such events as those of Germany two years ago including hyperinflation and MacDonald famously waved worthless Deutschmarks to emphasise the point. The result of the 1931 general election was the greatest landslide in British political history, the National Government winning a total of 556 seats and a Parliamentary majority of 500. It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52. MacDonald was unified with the Conservatives and Liberal National leaders on one platform (he returning 13 of his 20 National Labour candidates).

As few Labour MPs refused to abandon the wishes of the Trade Unionists led by Ernest Bevin, the support for the re-elected National Government was heavily Conservative.

==1931–1935==
Although the Conservatives had a bare majority in Cabinet of 11, compared to nine non-Conservatives, the former held comparatively few of the most important jobs. The two groups of Liberals were similarly unbalanced in terms of posts, the official Liberals holding one more seat than the National Liberals, despite the parliamentary position being reversed. That balance was to cause tensions, particularly as the Diehard wing of the Conservative party felt unrepresented.

The government entered protracted wrangling over whether or not to introduce tariffs. Both the Liberals and Snowden found it particularly difficult to accept but were in a heavy minority. However, both MacDonald and Baldwin wished to maintain the multiparty nature of the Government. On the suggestion of Hailsham, it was agreed to suspend the principle of Cabinet collective responsibility to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs while remaining in government. This held for some months.

In 1932, Sir Donald MacLean died. MacDonald came under pressure not to merely appoint another Liberal, particularly as it was felt that they would be over-represented, and so instead appointed the Conservative Lord Irwin (later Lord Halifax). Further tensions emerged over the Ottawa Agreement, which set up a series of tariff agreements within the British Empire, and the remaining Liberals and Snowden resigned their ministerial posts although they continued to support the government from the backbenches for another year. MacDonald considered resigning as well to allow a party government to take office but was persuaded to remain even though his health was now in decline. In domestic politics, he increasingly allowed Baldwin to give a lead, but in foreign affairs, the main direction was determined by MacDonald and Simon.

The most prominent policy of the National Government in the early 1930s was the proposal to introduce Indian Home Rule, a measure fiercely opposed by the Diehard wing of the Conservative party, with Winston Churchill one of the most open opponents. The bill was fiercely opposed but eventually passed in 1947 in very different circumstances.

==Baldwin takes over==
With MacDonald&#x27;s health failing, he retired as prime minister in June 1935, to be succeeded by Baldwin.

Increasingly foreign affairs were coming to dominate political discourse and in November Baldwin led the government to victory in the 1935 general election on a platform of support for the League of Nations and sanctions against Italy for invading Abyssinia. The following month a massive storm developed when it emerged that the new Foreign Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, had negotiated the Hoare-Laval Pact which proposed to cede most of Abyssinia to Italy. Many were outraged, including many government MPs, and the agreement was dropped and Hoare sacked, though he later returned to government. The government sponsored a series of conferences to enable more home rule in India and other colonies.

Baldwin&#x27;s last years in office were seen as a period of drift, but in late 1936 he achieved a notable triumph in resolving the Edward VIII abdication crisis without major repercussions. Baldwin took the occasion of George VI&#x27;s coronation as an opportune moment to retire.

==Peacetime government of Neville Chamberlain==

Neville Chamberlain was seen by many as the only possible successor to Baldwin, and his appointment as Prime Minister was widely credited with bringing a new dynamism to the government. With a strong track record as a radical Minister of Health and competent Chancellor of the Exchequer many expected Chamberlain to provide a strong lead in domestic affairs and here the government had a number of successes, such as over the nationalisation of coal mining royalties, the curtailing of excess working hours by the Factory Act and much slum clearance. Another success was the Holidays with Pay Act 1938, which gave a fortnight&#x27;s paid holiday a year to workers, starting in 1939. The school leaving age was also to be increased from Autumn 1939, but was deferred as war loomed. Further reforms were curtailed by the increased international tension which came to occupy most of his time.

In foreign affairs, the government sought to increase Britain&#x27;s armaments, while maintaining the unity of the Empire and Dominions and preventing any one power from becoming dominant on the continent of Europe. These proved increasingly difficult to reconcile, as many Dominions were reluctant to support Britain in the event of her going to war, and so military action risked splitting the Empire. Chamberlain took a strong personal lead in foreign affairs and sought to bring about peaceful revision of European frontiers in areas where many commentators had long-acknowledged grievances. In this, he received much popular support at the time, but the policy has been much attacked since. The most prominent point in the policy of appeasement came in September 1938, when the Munich Agreement was negotiated. Following the agreement, the government sped up the re-armament process in the hope of being ready for war when it came. At the same time, it took a tougher line in foreign affairs, including making a guarantee to defend Poland against Germany.

==Outbreak of war==

When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Britain declared war in tandem with France, supported by all of the Dominions except Ireland. For some time there had been calls to expand Chamberlain&#x27;s war ministry by bringing in members of the official Labour and Liberal parties but both parties refused to join (with the one exception of Liberal MP Gwilym Lloyd George, who joined the government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade). For the first few months of war Britain saw comparatively little action apart from at sea, but the failure of the Norwegian campaign led to a massive outcry in Parliament.

On 7 and 8 May 1940, a two-day debate took place in Parliament, known to history as the Norway Debate. Initially a discussion of what had gone wrong in that field, it soon turned into a general debate on the conduct of the war with fierce criticism expressed by all sides of the House. The government won the debate, albeit with a reduced majority, but over the next two days it became increasingly clear that Labour and the Liberals would have to be brought into government and that Chamberlain was unable to achieve this. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Low Countries and Chamberlain finally bowed to pressure and resigned, bringing the life of the National Government to a close. It was succeeded by an all-party coalition headed by Winston Churchill.

<text>Pereiaslav is a historical town in Boryspil Raion, Kyiv Oblast, central Ukraine. It is located near the confluence of the Alta and Trubizh rivers some southeast of the capital Kyiv. It was one of the key regional centers of power during the medieval period and served as the capital of a principality. Pereiaslav hosts the administration of Pereiaslav urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its population is approximately 

Possessing more than 20 museums, Pereiaslav is often described as a &quot;living museum&quot;, and was granted the status of .

== Etymology ==
=== Current name ===
The current name is implemented by the Verkhovna Rada on 30 September 2019 to reinstate its historical name.

The name of Pereiaslav in other languages are:

* , (also rendered as Pereyaslav)
* 
* 

=== Former names ===
* Pereiaslav (907 – 1943; also known as Pereiaslav-Ruskyi starting from 1152)
* Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi (1943–2019), 1943 – 29 October 2019

In 1152, Yuri Dolgorukiy founded the city of Pereslavl-Zalessky in the north-east of Kievan Rus. To distinguish the two cities, Pereiaslav was sometimes called Pereiaslav-Ruskyi in the 12th and 13th centuries. It is also known as Pereyaslavl-Yuzhnyy ().

==History==
===Kievan Rus&#x27;===
Pereiaslav played a significant role in the history of Ukraine. It was mentioned for the first time in the text of a 911 treaty with the Byzantine Empire, where it was mentioned as &quot;Pereyaslav-Ruskyi&quot; to distinguish it from Preslav in Bulgaria and later with newly established cities in Zalesye including Pereslavl-Zalessky and Pereyaslavl-Ryazansky.

Vladimir I (Volodymyr I), the grand prince of Kiev, built a large fortress in 992 to protect the southern limits of Kievan Rus&#x27; from raids of nomads from the steppes of what is now southern Ukraine. The city was the capital of the Principality of Pereyaslavl from the mid-11th century until its demolition by the Tatars in 1239, during the Mongol invasions.

===Lithuania and Poland===

During the 14th century, Pereiaslav was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Since, it was part of the Kiev Voivodeship, which in 1569 became part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1585, Polish King Stephen Báthory granted Perejasław Magdeburg city rights. It was a royal city of Poland.

===Cossack Hetmanate===

During the second half of the 16th century, Pereiaslav became a regimental city of the Zaphorozhian Host. Here in 1654 Bohdan Khmelnytskyi had the &quot;Pereiaslav Convent&quot;, where the Zaphorozhian Cossacks had voted for a military alliance with the Tsardom of Russia and accepted the Pereiaslav Agreement, bringing their lands under Russian rule. The treaty resulted in the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate in left-bank Ukraine subject to the Tsardom of Russia, and later to the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667). The town was known as &quot;Pereiaslav&quot; at that time, and later as &quot;Pereiaslav-Poltavskyi&quot;. According to the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667, Pereiaslav became part of Russia.

===Soviet museum center===
During World War II (part of which is known as the Great Patriotic War in USSR and Russia), the Soviet government, keen to glorify the Treaty of Pereiaslav as the ground for Ukraine&#x27;s unification with Russia, renamed Pereiaslav to &quot;Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi&quot; in October 1943 to stress Bohdan Khmelnytskyi&#x27;s role of that event. Later, the otherwise obscure town was established, as a dedicated museum and tourism center. By the request of the Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi City Council, the Ukrainian parliament reinstated the city to its historic name Pereiaslav in October 2019.

Until 18 July 2020, Pereiaslav was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and served as the administrative center of Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi Raion, even though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven, the city of Pereiaslav was merged into Boryspil Raion.

== Population ==
=== Language ===
Distribution of the population by native language according to the 2001 census:

===Jewish community===
The first mention of the Jewish community of Pereiaslav dates to 1620, when the townspeople complained to King Sigismund of the growing number and influence of Jews in Pereiaslav. Denying Jews the right to keep breweries, malt-houses and distilleries, having already prohibited them to engage in farming, the King ordered his commissioners to consider the other rights of Jews. Three years later, an agreement was signed allowing the Jews to enjoy all of the rights and liberties of urban citizens. This agreement was confirmed by King Sigismund.

Pereiaslav Jews were among the first to be killed during the first Khmelnytskyi uprising. Chronicler Nathan Hannover writes: &quot;And a lot of holy communities, based not far from the place of battle and unable to flee, like the holy communities of Pereiaslav, Baryshivka, Pyryatin, Borispil, Lubny, Lokhvitsa and the surrounding communities, died as martyrs of various cruel and heinous kinds of slaughter...&quot; («Yeven metsula», p. 94). Another chronicler, Rabbi Meir of Schebrzheschina, provides a detailed story: «The sacred community of Pereiaslav had drunk from the cup of bitterness several times; perplexed Jews fled to the sacred community of Borisovka (NB. probably Baryshivka). But the rebels also came there and slaughtered many Jews including infants. The local non-Jews pitied those who survived and brought them back to Pereiaslav, where they remained locked up like prisoners in their homes, because they were afraid to be seen by the rebels. At night, they did not know what the morning would bring, and in the morning - what the evening promised».

Famous Yiddish author Sholom Aleichem was born in Pereiaslav in 1859. He spent his childhood in the town of Voronkiv, but when the family became impoverished he returned to Pereiaslav, where he studied at the Russian gymnasium until 1876. In 1879, he again returned to Pereiaslav for several years. The town is described in detail in his autobiographical prose. In the town&#x27;s &#x27;ethnographic reserve&#x27;, there is a museum dedicated to him.
Additional Comments: ...After the 1654 Pereiaslav Council, the remnants of the Pereiaslav Jewish community became patronized by Russia. The left-bank Jews were allowed to stay in their homes, but the townspeople of Pereiaslav presented to Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich the law of 1620 limiting the rights of Jews, which was confirmed by the Tsar. Information about Pereiaslav Jews disappears from the same year 1654.

A new community developed during the late 18th century. According to the tax books of 1801, there were 5 Christian merchants, no Jewish merchants; 844 Christian townspeople and 66 Jewish townspeople. According to the audit of 1847, there was only one &quot;Pereiaslavskoe&#x27; Jewish community in the district, consisting of 1,519 people. According to the census of 1897, there were 185,000 inhabitants in the district, among them 9,857 Jews, including in Pereiaslav - 14,614 residents, of whom 5,754 were Jews. In 1910, three Jewish schools operated in Pereiaslav: first grade primary boys school, a private boys school, and a Talmud-Torah. At the end of the 19th century, the synagogue was built, it survived the war and has preserved until now – the factory of woven products named after B. Khmelnitsky is operating there.

On 30 June – 2 July 1881 there was a pogrom against the Jews in Pereiaslav. Among the victims were Jews who had fled here after the Kyiv pogrom. From Pereiaslav, the unrest spread to the surrounding areas. In June 1919, Ataman Zeleniy arranged a pogrom in Pereiaslav and 20 people were killed. By 1921, a Jewish &#x27;self-defense&#x27; organisation had been founded in Pereiaslav. In 1926, the Jewish community was flourishing despite the persecution and there were 3,590 Jews in Pereiaslav. At this time, there were 8 houses of study (&quot;batei midrash&quot;), 3 different Jewish schools, and 26 kosher butchers. During autumn 1941, on the outskirts of the city (the present territory of the Altitsky cemetery), 800 Jewish residents of Pereiaslav were shot. According to elderly residents, the exact date of the shooting was 4–5 November, however, the memorial plate indicates a different date – 6–8 October. On 19 May 1943, after a raid, 7 more Jewish women and 1 man were shot, and buried in the Altitsky cemetery.

The current Jewish population of Pereiaslav numbers fewer than 100. The community office is located in the building of the former synagogue.

There is a major river port in the city, working as part of Kyiv River Port.

=== Universities ===
Established in 1986 as a Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi branch of the Kyiv State Pedagogical Institute, HSUP continued the ancient educational traditions of Pereiaslav.

The roots of the University go back to the first half of the 18th century, namely, to 2.10.1738, when a collegium was founded in Pereiaslav. In 1808, after the reform of religious education institutions, Pereiaslav Collegium was reorganized into a seminary, which continued the educational traditions of the region, including teacher training.
By the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 949 of 24 November 1993, Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi State Pedagogical Institute was established on the basis of the Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi branch of the Drahomanov Ukrainian State Pedagogical University, named after H. S. Skovoroda in 1994 and recognized as accredited at the III level of accreditation by the decision of the State Accreditation Commission in 2000.

In 2002 by a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi Hryhorii Skovoroda State Pedagogical University was established on the basis of the Institute.

In 2004 and 2010, University was accredited at the IV level, in 2005 it was renamed to SHEI “Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi Hryhorii Skovoroda State Pedagogical University”, and on 14 July 2021, due to the previous renaming of the city and in order to simplify the name of the institution in the established European tradition of naming higher education institutions, it received a new official name - Hryhorii Skovoroda University in Pereiaslav.

<text>A polynya () is an area of open water surrounded by sea ice. It is now used as a geographical term for an area of unfrozen seawater within otherwise contiguous pack ice or fast ice. It is a loanword from the Russian (), which refers to a natural ice hole and was adopted in the 19th century by polar explorers to describe navigable portions of the sea.

There are two main types of polynyas: coastal polynyas, which can be found year-round near the Antarctic and Arctic coasts and are mainly created by strong winds pushing the ice away from the coast, and mid-sea or open-ocean polynyas, which may be found more sporadically in the middle of ice pack in certain locations, especially around Antarctica. These locations are generally preconditioned by certain oceanic dynamics.

One of the most famous mid-sea polynyas is the Weddell Polynya, also known as the Maud Rise Polynya, which occurs in the Lazarev Sea over the Maud Rise seamount. It was first spotted in September 1973 and persisted through multiple winters (1974–1976), and recently recurred in September 2017.

==Formation==
Coastal polynyas are formed through two main processes:
* A sensible heat polynya is thermodynamically driven, and typically occurs when warm water upwelling keeps the surface water temperature at or above the freezing point. This reduces ice production and may stop it altogether.
* A latent heat polynya is formed through the action of katabatic winds, which act to drive ice away from a fixed boundary such as a coastline, fast ice, or an ice bridge. The polynya forms initially when first-year pack ice is driven away from the coast, which leaves an area of open water within which new ice is formed. This new ice is then also herded downwind toward the first-year pack ice. When it reaches the pack ice, the new ice is consolidated onto the pack ice. This process continues over time. Latent heat polynyas are therefore a major source of sea ice production in the Antarctic.

Latent heat polynyas are regions of high ice production and therefore are possible sites of dense water production in both polar regions. The high ice production rates within these polynyas leads to a large amount of brine rejection into the surface waters; this salty water then sinks. It is an open question as to whether the polynyas of the Arctic can produce enough dense water to form a major portion of the dense water required to drive the thermohaline circulation.

Mid-sea polynyas are formed when specific atmospheric conditions occur over preconditioned oceanographic areas. Such atmospheric conditions should favor ice drift in opposite directions to open the ice pack. Polar cyclones are a typical atmospheric trigger for the occurrence of mid-sea polynyas as the cyclonic winds push the ice in opposite directions away from the cyclone center. Also, cold fronts, where two opposite flows in direction are found, are ideal for creating a mid-sea polynya.
===Antarctic bottom water===
Antarctic bottom water (AABW) is the dense water with high salinity that exists in the abyssal layer of the Southern Ocean. It plays a major role in the global overturning circulation. Coastal polynyas (latent heat polynyas) are a source of AABW as brine rejection during the formation of sea ice at these polynyas increases the salinity of the seawater, which then sinks down to the ocean bottom as AABW. Antarctic polynyas form when ice masses diverge from the coast and move away in the direction of the wind, creating an exposed area of sea water which subsequently freezes over, with brine rejection, to form another mass of ice.

==Ecology==
Some polynyas, such as the North Water Polynya between Canada and Greenland, occur seasonally at the same time and place each year. Because animals can adapt their life strategies to this regularity, these types of polynyas are of special ecological research significance. In winter, marine mammals such as walruses, narwhals, and belugas that do not migrate south remain there. Polar bears are known to be able to swim as far as across open waters of a polynya.

=== Polynya blooms ===
The presence of open water in an otherwise ice-covered area can result in a localized marine algal bloom, also referred to as a polynya bloom. While algal communities are often found under sea ice, as evidenced by ice algae, the rate of phytoplankton growth is substantially higher in the open water of a polynya. The primary drivers of polynya blooms are sunlight and nutrients. Specifically, the lack of sea ice allows light, a necessary component for photosynthesis, to penetrate deeper into the water and enable elevated phytoplankton growth compared to the surrounding ice-covered waters. Furthermore, polynya formation is typically associated with upwelling, a process that transports nutrient-rich water from the ocean bottom towards the surface. This influx of nutrients coupled with increased light levels often results in polynya blooms.

=== Biological production ===

In general, polynyas tend to be more biologically productive as a result of containing more phytoplankton than the surrounding water. Therefore, due to the role of primary producers as the foundation of the marine food web, polynyas are a critical food source for a variety of organisms such as fish, birds, and marine mammals. Listed below are several examples of the importance of polynyas to polar communities.

* Increased seal mortality rates were observed during years when the Ross Sea Polynya did not open. 
* In eastern Antarctica, 91% of Adélie penguin colonies are linked to a coastal polynya, where polynya size often correlates to colony size. 
* The presence of polynyas in McMurdo Sound provides an ice-free area where penguins can feed, directly effecting the survival of the Cape Royds penguin colony.
* The downward transport of carbon (in the form of marine snow) from the surface to the seafloor associated with polynya blooms provides the nutrients necessary to sustain rich benthic communities.

== Human dependency ==
Polynyas have also supported human populations throughout history. For example, the North Water Polynya, the largest and most biologically productive Arctic polynya, serves as a critical source of food in an otherwise barren region, enabling the existence of high-latitude human communities in the region for thousands of years. It may have served as a stepping stone for the original settlers of Greenland as they traversed through what is now northern Canada 4500 years ago. There are also indications that the North Water Polynya has aided Thule, Inuit, Norse, and western explorers throughout history. Today, the North Water Polynya enables the existence of Greenland&#x27;s northernmost towns, such as Qaanaaq, Qeqertat, Savissivik and Siorapaluk.

==Arctic navigation==

When submarines of the U.S. Navy made expeditions to the North Pole in the 1950s and 1960s, there was significant concern about surfacing through the thick pack ice of the Arctic Ocean. In 1962, both the USS &quot;Skate&quot; and USS &quot;Seadragon&quot; surfaced within the same large polynya near the North Pole for the first polar rendezvous of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

<text>The Gepard-class frigates, Russian designation Project 11661, is a Russian class of frigates that were intended as successors to the earlier s and , and corvettes. The first unit of the class, &quot;Yastreb&quot; (&quot;Hawk&quot;), was laid down at the Zelenodol&#x27;sk Zavod shipyard at Tatarstan in 1991. She was launched in July 1993, after which she began fitting out; fitting was nearly completed by late 1995, when it was suspended due to lack of funds. Renamed &quot;Tatarstan&quot;, the ship was finally completed in July 2002, and became the flagship of the Caspian Flotilla. She has two sister ships, &quot;Albatross&quot; (renamed &quot;Dagestan&quot;), and &quot;Burevestnik&quot; (&quot;Storm Petrel&quot;), which was still under construction .

Vietnam is the main operator of the class with its navy having commissioned 4 frigates - twice the size of Russia&#x27;s Project 11661 inventory - and having plans to order at least 2 more.

==Design==
These vessels are capable of employing their weapons systems in conditions up to Sea State 5. The hull and superstructure are constructed primarily of steel, with some aluminium-magnesium being used in the upper superstructure(stealth technology). They are equipped with fin stabilizers and twin rudders, and can use either gas turbines or diesel for propulsion in a CODOG configuration.

&quot;Gepard&quot; is Russian for cheetah.

==Service history==
In October 2015, &quot;Dagestan&quot;, in company with three other Russian Navy ships serving with the Caspian Flotilla, launched cruise missiles at targets in Syria. The missiles flew nearly over Iran and Iraq and struck targets in Raqqa and Aleppo provinces (controlled by the Islamic State) as well as Idlib province (controlled by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front). Peshmerga forces (Kurdish armed forces located in northern Iraq) published a video allegedly depicting two cruise missiles mid-flight en route to Syria.

On 6 November 2024 an A-22 drone from the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck the Kaspiysk naval base and reportedly damaged both &quot;Tatarstan&quot; and &quot;Dagestan&quot; as well as one .

==Export==

The Gepard-class was designed from the outset as a lightweight, inexpensive export vessel. Russia offers three variants of the class to the market:
*Gepard 3.9: designed to search, track and fight against surface, underwater and air enemy independently and within task force, plant mine fields, provide protection and patrol of maritime state border and exclusive economic zone, perform combat missions, patrol service. Powered by gas-turbine engines with CODOG configuration. Fitted with two inclined quadruple launchers for eight Kh-35 anti-ship missiles with alternative options to be featured with VLS systems such as UKSK (for cruise missiles such as Club-N and Yakhont) and Shtil-1 air-defense system. Being the only exported variant with Vietnam being its first and only operator.
*Gepard 5.1: configured as an ocean-going patrol ship. Intended for patrolling territorial waters, helping in distress on the sea, environment protection, support to marine missions and flag demonstration in areas being of state interest. Can be featured with &quot;heavier&quot; weapons if necessary. Powered entirely by diesel engines with a two-shaft CODAD propulsion plant.
*Gepard 5.3: designed to search, track and fight against surface, underwater and air enemy independently and within task force, carry out convoy missions and patrol duty, guard maritime state border and economic zone. Featured with four quadruple launchers for sixteen Kh-35 anti-ship missiles. Powered by a two-shaft CODAD propulsion plant.

=== Vietnam ===
In March and August of 2011, the Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy received two Gepard 3.9-class frigates ordered in 2006, built in Russia at Tatarstan&#x27;s Gorky Shipbuilding Plant. In late 2011, Vietnam signed a contract for an additional batch of two ships in an anti-submarine configuration. A further two ships are being considered to bring the total order up to six vessels, and that potential acquisition is likely being stalled due to sanctions towards Russia as a result of the Ukrainian conflicts.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka began talks for the credit purchase of a Gepard 5.1 frigate in 2017 and the Sri Lankan cabinet approved the proposal by President Maithripala Sirisena for the purchase of the ship in September 2017.

<text>Beit Hall, forming part of Beit Quadrangle, is a hall of residence and one of Imperial College London&#x27;s oldest and most historic buildings. Beit Hall is named after Alfred Beit and is located on Prince Consort Road, next to the Royal Albert Hall in London. The north side of the quadrangle forms the Union Building, home to Imperial College Union, and is not part of Beit Hall. The Union Building was the site of the first Queen concert, and has hosted events associated with the BBC Proms.

Beit Hall was built on architect Aston Webb&#x27;s designs to accommodate Imperial College students. Parts of the building were originally used for academic purposes: 

* Students&#x27; Union built in 1910–11
* East side of the quadrangle: botany and plant pathology and physiology built in 1912–14
* West side: biochemistry built in 1921–23
* North/west side end: hostel built in 1925–26
* South side of the quad, fronting Prince Consort Road: Beit Building built 1930–31

It accommodates 330 students. During term-time, Beit Hall functions as student halls, whilst during the remaining 14 weeks Beit becomes a conference centre and hotel. On the front façade is a relief of the coat of arms of Imperial College.

Books left by students in Beit were collected into a circulation library of around 400 items for personal reading in the Union Building in the mid-20th century. This later became the Haldane Library and is now part of the main library collection.

<text>Robert Fordyce Aickman (27 June 1914 – 26 February 1981) was an English writer and conservationist. As a conservationist, he co-founded the Inland Waterways Association, a group which has preserved from destruction and restored England&#x27;s inland canal system. As a writer, he is best known for his supernatural fiction, which he described as &quot;strange stories&quot;.
The writer of his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, as quoted by Mike Ashley, said: &quot;... his most outstanding and lasting achievement was as a writer of what he himself like to call &#x27;strange tales.&#x27; He brought to these his immense knowledge of the occult, psychological insights and a richness of background and characterisation which rank his stories with those of M. R. James and Walter de la Mare.&quot; Ashley himself wrote: &quot;Aickman&#x27;s writings are an acquired taste like fine wines. I have no doubt that his work will always remain unknown to the majority of readers, and perhaps he would have wanted it that way. He wrote what and how he wanted, for expression, not for popularity. In another of his letters to me he said &#x27;I have received a good deal of esteem, but never a big commercial success, and am usually wondering whether anything by me will ever be published again.&#x27; ... It is astonishing that someone of Aickman&#x27;s stature should have difficulty in selling his work. Perhaps now, too late for Aickman&#x27;s benefit, someone will have the sense to publish it.&quot; This situation has since been remedied by an extensive programme of reprints of Aickman&#x27;s work by Tartarus Press, Faber, and New York Review Books Classics.

&quot;Robert Aickman: An Attempted Biography&quot; (2022), by R. B. Russell, is the first full-length biography of Aickman.

==Life==
Aickman was born in London, England, the son of architect William Arthur Aickman and Mabel Violet Marsh. He attended Highgate School from January 1928 until July 1931. Mike Ashley reported that at the time he compiled his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Horror and Fantasy Fiction&quot;, Aickman objected to the inclusion of his date of birth. Instead he said that the entry should read &quot;Aickman, Robert. Man of Mystery&quot;. &quot;That&quot;, he said, &quot;would be helpful. I should approve entirely.&quot; On his mother&#x27;s side, Aickman was the grandson of the prolific Victorian novelist Richard Marsh (1857–1915), known for his occult thriller &quot;The Beetle&quot; (1897), a book as popular in its time as Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.

He was involved in an investigation into the well-known haunting of Borley Rectory. Another indication of his lifelong interest in the supernatural is his longstanding membership of The Ghost Club. He remarked in a letter to Mike Ashley, &quot;What impact such things have had on me, and the sources of my inspiration, are simply too much for a letter. If you wish to pursue such topics, I shall be pleased to have a talk.&quot; Unfortunately that talk never took place, but Ashley points out that Aickman&#x27;s early life, including some supernatural episodes, will be found detailed in his autobiography, &quot;The Attempted Rescue&quot; (Gollancz, 1966).

He originally helped with some clerical work in his father&#x27;s architectural office. In the opening lines of &quot;The Attempted Rescue&quot;, Aickman described his father as &quot;the oddest man I have ever known&quot;.

Of Aickman&#x27;s character, Elizabeth Jane Howard said in a 2011 interview at the Tartarus Press blog, that he &quot;hated children&quot; and of his childhood that &quot;He told me about his childhood but I think he exaggerated that. I went to the house in Stanmore where he was brought up, and his mother did go and leave him, and that probably had a much worse effect than he realised on him. He was reading by the time he was four and he went to very good schools. Highgate was a very good school. I think it probably was a fairly lonely childhood. … He could be very prickly and difficult, or he could be very charming. He certainly had the gift of the gab.&quot;

Aickman was married to literary agent and children&#x27;s book author Edith Ray Gregorson (1914–1983) (known as &#x27;Ray&#x27;) from 1941 to 1957. She authored &quot;Lemuel&quot; (illustrated by Peter Scott, husband of Elizabeth Jane Howard, with whom Aickman had an affair) and &quot;Timothy Tramcar&quot;.

He had been responsible for the general direction of the very successful Market Harborough Festival of Boats and Yachts, attended by more than 50,000 visitors. This was topped in 1962 when he directed the Waterborne concert with fireworks at the City of London Festival, with an audience of 100,000.

With a keen interest in the theatre, ballet, and music, Aickman also served as a chairman of the London Opera Society (1954–69) and was active in the London Opera Club, the Ballet Minerva, and the Mikron Theatre Company (a company which performs via touring the canal waterways of Britain).

In the mid-1970s, Aickman lived in a flat in Willoughby House on the Barbican Estate. In 1977 he moved to a flat in Gledhow Gardens, Earl&#x27;s Court, where he lived until his death.

Aickman was diagnosed with cancer in the winter of 1979. He refused to have conventional treatment and consulted a homoeopath. He had planned to go to the US in the autumn of 1980, to receive a fantasy award, but he was too ill to travel, despite rallying in the summer. He died in the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital on 26 February 1981. His obituary appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; on 28 February. Later, there was a memorial concert at the Royal Society of Arts, at which various well-known people, including the naturalist Sir Peter Scott, paid tribute to him.

In 2015 R. B. Russell and Rosalie Parker of Tartarus Press released a feature-length documentary on the life and work of Robert Aickman, which was premiered at the World Fantasy Convention. It includes interviews with friends of Robert Aickman, and the authors Reggie Oliver and Jeremy Dyson. It can now be seen on YouTube.

==Conservation==

Aickman is probably best remembered for his co-founding of the Inland Waterways Association, a group devoted to restoring and preserving England&#x27;s then-neglected and largely derelict inland canal system.

The association was sparked off by a letter sent by Aickman to L. T. C. Rolt following the publication in 1944 of Rolt&#x27;s highly successful book &quot;Narrow Boat&quot;, describing the declining and largely unknown world of the British canals. The inaugural meeting took place on 15 February 1946 in London, with Aickman as chairman and Rolt as honorary secretary.

The IWA organised successful campaigns and attracted notable supporters, including as president the writer and parliamentarian Sir A. P. Herbert and as vice-president the naturalist Peter Scott. Scott&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Jane Howard, was part-time secretary, working in Aickman&#x27;s flat in Gower Street; she had an affair with Aickman, which she describes in her autobiography &quot;Slipstream&quot; (Macmillan, 2002).

Aickman began to have policy disagreements with Rolt. Aickman wanted to campaign to keep all of the waterways open, whereas Rolt had sympathies with the traditional canal workers and believed it necessary to prioritise which canals could be kept open. The disagreement became public: Aickman had organised the IWA&#x27;s first boat rally and festival in August 1950 and attempted to prevent Rolt from attending and promoting his book &quot;The Inland Waterways of England&quot;; nevertheless, Rolt attended, as did his publisher, Philip Unwin. Aickman engineered a change to the rules to require all members to conform to agreed IWA principles, and in early 1951 Rolt and others were excluded from membership. Aickman published two nonfiction books on the waterways in 1955.

Nevertheless, the IWA has been one of the most successful conservation organisations in British history, succeeding in restoring and reopening much of the original canal network.

==Literary work==

===Fiction===
As a writer, Aickman is best known for the 48 &quot;strange stories&quot; that were published in eight volumes, one of them posthumous. The American collection &quot;Painted Devils&quot; consists of revised versions of stories which had previously appeared in other books.

After three of his stories appeared in &quot;We Are for the Dark&quot; (1954), occasional short stories appeared in magazines and anthologies during the rest of the 1950s, but Aickman&#x27;s involvement with his many societies kept him from any writing at length. The year 1964 thus came as a watershed, with a slightly mystical novel, &quot;The Late Breakfasters&quot;, a story collection (&quot;Dark Entries&quot;) and the first &quot;Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot;, which he edited for eight volumes. &quot;Those, if any, who wish to know more about me&quot;, Aickman wrote in 1965, &quot;should plunge beneath the frivolous surface of &quot;The Late Breakfasters&quot;.&quot; Opening as a comedy of manners, its playful seriousness slowly fades into an elegiac variation on the great Greek myth of thwarted love.

His own subsequent collections were &quot;Powers of Darkness&quot; (1966), &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; (1968), &quot;Cold Hand in Mine&quot; (1976), &quot;Tales of Love and Death&quot; (1977) and &quot;Intrusions&quot; (1980).

In the essay that Aickman wrote in response to receiving a World Fantasy Award, he wrote:
&quot;Cold Hand in Mine&quot; and &quot;Painted Devils&quot; featured dust jacket drawings by acclaimed gothic illustrator Edward Gorey. August Derleth proposed that Arkham House should publish a book of Aickman&#x27;s best stories, but was unable to meet the author&#x27;s demands and withdrew the proposal. The original collections of short stories are quite scarce, though copies of the U.S. edition of &quot;Cold Hand in Mine&quot; are very plentiful.

&quot;The Model: A Novel of the Fantastic&quot; (New York: Arbor House, 1987) was a novella which remained unpublished in his lifetime. Aickman had hoped to have the work illustrated by Edward Gorey. According to Mike Ashley, &quot;Aickman bemoaned the lack of publisher interest in this work of about 35,000 words.&quot;

Tartarus Press published a new collection of unpublished and uncollected fiction and non-fiction in 2015 as &quot;The Strangers and Other Writings&quot;. In 2018, NYRB Classics released &quot;Compulsory Games: And Other Stories&quot; (edited and with an introduction by Victoria Nelson), a collection of previously published short stories culled primarily from 1977&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Love and Death.&quot;

====Awards====
In 1975, Aickman received the World Fantasy Award for short fiction for his story &quot;Pages from a Young Girl&#x27;s Journal&quot;. This story had originally appeared in February 1973 in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;; it was reprinted in &quot;Cold Hand in Mine&quot;. The winning of this award pleased Aickman immensely, as at that time he considered it his best story.

In 1981, the year of his death, Aickman was awarded the British Fantasy Award for his story &quot;The Stains&quot;, which had first appeared in the anthology &quot;New Terrors&quot; (London: Pan, 1980), edited by Ramsey Campbell. It subsequently appeared posthumously in &quot;Night Voices&quot;.

====Adaptations====
In 1968, a television adaptation of &quot;Ringing the Changes&quot;, retitled &quot;The Bells of Hell&quot;, appeared on the BBC 2 programme &quot;Late Night Horror&quot;. A radio play version based on &quot;Ringing the Changes&quot; was broadcast on the CBC Radio drama series &quot;Nightfall&quot; on 31 October 1980.

In 1987, HTV West produced a six-episode anthology series for television called &quot;Night Voices&quot;, of which four were based upon stories by Aickman: &quot;The Hospice&quot;, &quot;The Inner Room&quot;, &quot;Hand In Glove&quot; and &quot;The Trains&quot;.

A 1997 adaptation of &quot;The Swords&quot; by Howard A. Rodman was directed by Tony Scott. It appeared as the first episode of the cable original horror anthology series &quot;The Hunger&quot;. 

Jeremy Dyson has adapted Aickman&#x27;s work into drama in a number of forms. A musical staging of his short story &quot;The Same Dog&quot;, for which Dyson co-wrote the libretto with Joby Talbot, premiered in 2000 at the Barbican Concert Hall. In 2000, with his League of Gentlemen collaborator Mark Gatiss, Dyson adapted Aickman&#x27;s short story &quot;Ringing the Changes&quot; into a BBC Radio Four radio play. This aired exactly twenty years after the CBC adaptation, on Halloween 2000. Dyson also directed a 2002 short film based on Aickman&#x27;s story &quot;The Cicerones&quot; with Gatiss as the principal actor.

In August 2019 BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast five of Aickman&#x27;s short stories as part of its &quot;Short Works&quot; series. &quot;Just a Song at Twilight&quot;, &quot;Le Miroir&quot;, &quot;Raising the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Coffin House&quot; and &quot;The Fully-Conducted Tour&quot; were read by Tim McInnerny.

===As editor===
In addition to writing his own stories, Aickman edited the first eight volumes of the &quot;Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot; between 1964 and 1972. He was assisted in this by Christine Bernard, an editor at Collins. He selected six of his own stories for inclusion over the course of the series. The fourth and sixth volumes lack one of his tales. He also supplied an introduction for every volume except the sixth.

===Nonfiction===
Aickman&#x27;s autobiographical writing consists of the two memoirs &quot;The Attempted Rescue&quot; (London: Victor Gollancz, 1966) and &quot;The River Runs Uphill: A Story of Success and Failure&quot; (Burton-on-Trent: Pearson, 1986). In 2001, Tartarus Press reissued the former volume in a new edition with a foreword by the writer and Aickman enthusiast Jeremy Dyson. Tartarus also reprinted the latter, with extra text which had been edited out of the first edition.

For a time, Aickman served as theatre critic for &quot;The Nineteenth Century and After&quot;. His reviews remain, to date, uncollected in book form. He also wrote two books relating to his conservation activities, &quot;Know Your Waterways&quot; and &quot;The Story of Our Inland Waterways&quot; (both 1955).

===Unpublished works===
Aickman produced a number of works that remain unpublished. These include the plays &quot;Allowance for Error&quot;, &quot;Duty&quot; and &quot;The Golden Round&quot;. A philosophical work entitled &quot;Panacea: The Synthesis of an Attitude&quot; runs to over 1,000 pages in manuscript form. Copies of these items are preserved, along with Aickman&#x27;s manuscripts and other papers, in the Robert Aickman Collection at the British Library, with some papers deposited at Bowling Green State University, Ohio.

<text>The away goals rule is a method of tiebreaking in association football and other sports when teams play each other twice, once at each team&#x27;s home ground. Under the away goals rule, if the total goals scored by each team are equal, the team that has scored more goals &quot;away from home&quot; wins the tiebreaker. This is sometimes expressed by saying that away goals &quot;count double&quot; in the event of a tie, though in practice the team with more away goals is simply recorded as the victor, rather than having additional or &#x27;double&#x27; goals added to their total.

The away goals rule is most often invoked in two-leg fixtures, where the initial result is determined by the aggregate score — i.e. the scores of both games are added together. In many competitions, the away goals rule is the first tie-breaker in such cases, with a penalty shootout as the second tie-breaker if each team has scored the same number of away goals. Rules vary as to whether the away goals rule applies only to the end of normal time of the second leg, or applies in extra time as well. It was first introduced by UEFA in the 1965–66 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Since the early 2020s in association football, the application of the away goals rule has been repeatedly scrutinized and ultimately abolished in numerous competitions. There is empirical evidence that the away goals rule reduces the total number of goals scored during the match and benefits visiting teams in the second leg due to the different perceptions of risk in the first leg and the second leg. There are two other commonly cited reasons for the abandonment of the rule. One is the fact of away goals being an anachronism of 1960s football when the allocation of stadium capacity specifically for travelling away supporters did not exist as a practice, which is no longer the case with more widely available modes of transportation and ease of travel for supporters. Another more unsportsmanlike reason is the fact that, in the event of extra time at the end of the second leg, the away team unfairly benefits from extra time to score a more valuable away goal. The away goals rule was abolished in all UEFA club competitions from the 2021–22 season, all CONMEBOL club competitions from the 2022 season, then in all AFC club competitions from the 2023–24 season.

== Explanation ==

Example A

* In the first leg, the final score is: Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).
* In the second leg, the final score is: Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1, but as neither team scored an away goal, the match will progress to the next tie-breaker, extra time.

Example B

* In the first leg, the final score is: Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).
* In the second leg, the final score is: Team B (Home) 2–1 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 2–2. However, because Team A scored an away goal in the second leg while Team B, in the first leg, did not, Team A will progress to the next stage of the competition as they scored more away goals than Team B.

Example C

In the first leg, the final score is:

* &quot;First leg:&quot; Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).

In the second leg, the final score goes as follows:

* &quot;Second leg, after 90 minutes:&quot; Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).
* &quot;Second leg, after extra time:&quot; Team B (Home) 2–1 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1 after 90 minutes in the second leg and neither team has scored an away goal, the match goes into extra time. The score remains level 2–2 on aggregate after extra time. However, Team A has now scored an away goal and competition rules count away goals after extra time, Team A will thus progress to the next stage of the competition, as they scored more away goals than Team B.

Example D

In the first leg, the final score is:

* &quot;First leg:&quot; Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).

In the second leg, the final score goes as follows:

* &quot;Second leg, after 90 minutes:&quot; Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).
* &quot;Second leg, after extra time:&quot; Team B (Home) 2–1 Team A (Away).
In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1 after 90 minutes in the second leg and neither team has scored an away goal, the match goes into extra time. After extra time, the scores remain level 2–2 on aggregate, and Team A has now scored an away goal. However, unlike in example C, the competition rules don&#x27;t count the away goals in extra time, and the match will progress to a penalty shootout.

Example E

In the first leg, the final score is:

* &quot;First leg:&quot; Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).

In the second leg, the final score goes as follows:

* &quot;Second leg, after 90 minutes:&quot; Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).
* &quot;Second leg, after extra time:&quot; Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1, but as neither team scored an away goal, the match will progress to the next tie-breaker, extra time. Since no further goals are scored there, the match will progress to a penalty shootout.

Example F

* &quot;First leg:&quot; Team A (Home) 0–1 Team B (Away).
* &quot;Second leg:&quot; Team B (Home) 1–2 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 2–2. However, because Team A has scored more away goals than Team B, Team A will progress to the next stage of the competition.

== Rationale ==

Originally, the away goal rule was introduced in football as an expedited way of doing away with playoffs or tie breakers on neutral grounds to resolve a logistical, physical and calendar problem when two teams were so closely matched the final score over the two legs remained in absolute parity, which could remain even after a third game tie breaker. The away goals rule is intended to encourage the away team to be more aggressive. In football, at least, it can lead to a nervous first leg: the home team is unwilling to commit large numbers of players to attack to avoid conceding an away goal, whilst the away team attempts to snatch an away goal to aid them in the second leg. Such tactics arguably make the second leg more exciting, after a low-scoring first leg leaves both sides with a chance to win. There are sometimes debates over whether the away goals rule gives an unfair advantage to the team playing away first — with the other team squandering their home advantage in the first leg due to away goal fears — and this may be a factor in its somewhat patchy adoption for competitions.

The rule can also make the game more exciting as normally one goal can only make the difference between losing and drawing, or between drawing and winning, but with the away goals rule, one goal can make the difference between losing and winning.

There is also the issue that if extra time is played in the second leg, the away team gets an extra 30 minutes to take advantage of the away goals rule. This can be countered by the fact that in extra time, the home team has the advantage of playing the extra 30 minutes at home. In addition, usually, the home team had made a better campaign in the group stage, which would naturally give it some advantage over the away team.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that most teams feel an away goal puts them in the driving seat, such as Liverpool being able to draw 1–1 at Arsenal in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League quarterfinals; Liverpool did eliminate Arsenal to advance to the semi-finals.
Liverpool won the second game 4–2, making the aggregate score for the tie Liverpool 5–3 Arsenal, therefore, the away goal scored by Liverpool in the first leg was not required.
Many commentators have described the importance of a team being able to score an away goal, even when losing that leg of the tie, as it mathematically does give that team a chance to redeem itself on home soil by leveling the tie on aggregate while using the away goal as a tiebreaker. For example, in the 2007 UEFA Champions League round of 16, while Bayern Munich lost the first leg 2–3 at Real Madrid, Bayern later won 2–1 at home to level the tie on aggregate, but it was Bayern&#x27;s away goals scored during their first leg loss that let them advance. In the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, Bayern Munich won both round of 16 and quarter-finals on the away goal rule after drawing 4–4 on aggregate, by winning 2–1 at home and losing 2–3 away, against Fiorentina and Manchester United respectively.

In the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, despite losing 1–4 in the first leg to Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid would have been able to advance if at home it managed to hold Dortmund to 3–0; during the second leg Real Madrid scored two goals in the last ten minutes but were unable to score the third goal that would have sent them through to the final (Dortmund advanced 4–3 on aggregate). In the other semi-final, however, after Barcelona were defeated away by Bayern Munich 4–0, commentators considered Barcelona essentially eliminated because Bayern could seal the tie by scoring one away goal even if Barcelona managed to score five goals (Bayern managed a 3–0 win in the second leg to advance 7–0 on aggregate).

The away goals rule can result in the &quot;lead&quot; of the two-legged tie swinging back and forth. For instance, in the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League round of 16 between Barcelona and Chelsea, Barcelona were ahead on aggregate after a 2–1 win in the first leg at home. During the second leg held in London, Chelsea first scored three straight goals to take the lead on aggregate (4–2), but Barcelona responded with two goals to level the aggregate score at 4–4 while taking the lead on away goals (2–1). Chelsea scored again, though, to advance on aggregate, 5–4. In the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League semi-finals between Tottenham Hotspur and Ajax, Ajax led the tie from the 15th minute of the first leg (in a 1–0 away victory in London) until the 95th minute of the second leg (at that point still up 3–2 on aggregate), when Tottenham&#x27;s Lucas Moura completed a hat-trick in Amsterdam that leveled the aggregate score at 3–3 while eliminating Ajax, 3–1, on away goals.

== Usage ==
The away goals rule was applied in many football competitions that involve two-leg fixtures, including the knockout stages of the CAF Champions League, CAF Confederation Cup, and any two-legged playoffs in qualification for the FIFA World Cup or European Championships.

From 2014 until 2018, Major League Soccer in the U.S. and Canada used the away goals rule in the MLS Cup Playoffs, in which the conference semi-finals and finals (the quarterfinals and semi-finals of the overall tournament) were two-legged. The rule was first applied in this competition when Seattle Sounders FC defeated FC Dallas in the 2014 Western Conference semi-finals. In the 2019 MLS season, two-legged ties were eliminated in favour of a single-elimination knockout format throughout the entire playoffs.

In the Liga MX, the away goals rule always applied to the playoff games until the 2020–21 season. This was also applied to the final games until the 1995–96 season where Necaxa beat Celaya F.C. In those games, Necaxa was able to pull a 1–1 tie in the game in Celaya, then the team was able to hold a 0–0 tie in Azteca Stadium to win the championship. After that final, the away goals rule was removed from the final game and in case of a tie after the two games, it will go to extra time and a penalty shootout if needed, as happened in the Invierno 1999 season where Atlas F.C. and Deportivo Toluca were tied 5–5 (3-3 and 2-2) at the end of the second game (that would give Toluca the championship by away goals) but it went to extra time and a penalty shootout where Toluca beat Atlas 5–3 to win the championship.

In CONMEBOL competitions before 2005, for example the Copa Libertadores, neither away goals rule nor extra time were used. Ties that were level on aggregate went to an immediate penalty shootout. From 2005 until 2021, two-legged ties were decided on points, followed by goal difference and the away goals rule; if the result was still tied, the penalty shootout was used. The finals became the only exception to the away goals and extra time. In Latin America, an example of a tournament that used the away goal rule was the Copa do Brasil (Brazil Cup) until the 2017 edition.

The Football League Cup semi-finals, when previously played over two legs, would apply the away goals rule only after extra time.

The away goals rule is sometimes used in round-robin competitions (that is, leagues or qualifying groups), where it may be used to break ties involving more than two teams. For example, head-to-head away goals are the fourth tiebreaker in the group stage of both the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup, and UEFA Conference League. This regulation remained in force even after UEFA abolished the use of the away goals rule in knockout matches. In Group C of the UEFA Champions League 2000–01, Olympique Lyonnais took the second qualifying spot ahead of Olympiacos on head-to-head away goals. Because other tiebreakers take precedence, the away goals rule is rarely invoked in such tournaments; for example World Cup qualification. However, the away goals rule was not used in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification.

The away goals rule was first applied in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup when Budapest Honvéd beat Dukla Prague in the second round in 1965–66. It was introduced in the Fairs Cup in 1966–67, and in the European Cup in 1967–68 for the first round, 1968–69 for the second round, and 1970–71 for later rounds. Previously, ties level on aggregate had gone to a playoff on neutral ground.

On 24 June 2021, UEFA approved the proposal to abolish the away goals rule in all club competitions from the 2021–22 season. After that, AFC followed the suit starting from the 2023–24 season.

== Anomalies ==
If the two clubs contesting a two-legged fixture share the same stadium, each club may be the home club in one leg, and the rule may still apply. For example, the 2003 UEFA Champions League semi-finals drew Inter Milan and AC Milan together. Both legs were played at the San Siro, their shared stadium in Milan:

* &quot;First leg:&quot; AC Milan 0–0 Inter Milan
* &quot;Second leg:&quot; Inter Milan 1–1 AC Milan

With an aggregate of 1–1, AC Milan was declared the winner because they were the &quot;away&quot; side in the second game. In this example, as in many such cases, most tickets for each leg will be reserved for the &quot;home&quot; side&#x27;s fans, so the designation was not totally arbitrary.

Not all competitions with the away goals rule suffer from this anomaly, however: the Copa do Brasil has developed its rules to avoid some anomalies, such as the above. In that Cup, if two teams share either the same stadium or the same home town, neither is considered the home club and thus the away goals rule does not apply. This exception was seen, for example, in the 2006 final between Flamengo and Vasco, when both legs were played at the Maracanã Stadium.

More anomalous was a qualification play-off for the 1991 World Youth Championship between Australia and Israel: Australia won on away goals even though, due to security concerns arising from the First Intifada, Israel&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; leg was played in Australia. The same situation occurred in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification tie between the Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands, when the Bahamas advanced on the away goals rule even though both legs were played in the Bahamas.

There has been at least one case of a wrong application of the away goals rule by a referee in an international club tournament. It happened in a second-round tie in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup between Rangers and Sporting Clube de Portugal. This fixture had the following scorelines:

* &quot;First leg:&quot; Rangers 3–2 Sporting
* &quot;Second leg, after 90 minutes:&quot; Sporting 3–2 Rangers
* &quot;Second leg, after extra time:&quot; Sporting 4–3 Rangers

Since the teams were now level 6–6 on aggregate, the Dutch referee Laurens van Raavens ordered a penalty shootout, which Sporting won 3–0. Rangers appealed the loss, however, because Van Raavens should not have ordered the shootout, since the Rangers goal in extra time in Lisbon gave them a lead of three away goals to two. Rangers won the appeal and went on to win the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup that season.

CONCACAF used a different rule for its CONCACAF Champions League, employing away goals at the end of regulation of the second leg but not applying the rule at the end of extra time. It has since abolished extra time in that tournament with penalty kicks used if teams are even on goals and away goals after both legs. MLS adopted this version of the rule for its playoffs in 2014. For example, the semifinal of the 2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League between Cruz Azul and the Puerto Rico Islanders had the following scorelines:

* &quot;First leg:&quot; Puerto Rico Islanders 2–0 Cruz Azul
* &quot;Second leg, after 90 minutes:&quot; Cruz Azul 2–0 Puerto Rico Islanders
* &quot;Second leg, after extra time:&quot; Cruz Azul 3–1 Puerto Rico Islanders

Since CONCACAF does not apply the away goals rule for goals scored in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout, which Cruz Azul won 4–2.

A similar situation occurred in the 2018 MLS Cup Playoffs, in the second leg of Seattle Sounders FC vs Portland Timbers. After both legs went 2–1, for a 3–3 aggregate (with equal away goals) after regulation time, the game went to extra time. In extra time, both teams scored. At the end of extra time, the away team, Timbers, began to celebrate, assuming their away goal in extra time would break the tie; but the tournament did not apply the away goals rule to extra time goals, leading to a penalty shootout (which Timbers won 4–2).

The away goals rule can also apply to forfeited matches. Celtic lost their away tie to Legia Warsaw 4–1 in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. In their home leg, Legia brought on an ineligible player which automatically gave Celtic a 3–0 win. The forfeiture meant that the tie ended 4–4, meaning Celtic qualified to the next round, 1–0, on away goals.

The away goals rule can also apply to matches played behind closed doors. For the 2019–20 and 2020–21 editions of the UEFA Champions League, although the away goals rule remained in place for these seasons, home advantage was nullified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic having no home fans for support (empty stadiums) and even being forced to relocate their &quot;home&quot; to alternate venues, leading to UEFA deciding to abolish the away goals rule. Both legs of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League round of 16 contest between Porto and Juventus were played without fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Porto won the first leg 2–1 at home and trailed the second leg by the same score after regulation. Both teams scored a goal in extra time and Porto went through, 2–1, on away goals. In the same 2020–21 season, the quarter-final between Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain ended in a 3–3 draw on aggregate, but Paris Saint-Germain scored more away goals than Bayern Munich, 3–1, to qualify for the semi-finals.

== Summary ==
Below is a summary of the variations of rules and examples of current competitions using the away goals rule for two legged-ties. In most examples in the table below, a penalty shoot-out is used to determine the winner if all criteria used remain tied.

<text>Mark Anthony McKoy (born December 10, 1961) is a Canadian retired track and field athlete. He won the gold medal in the 110 metres hurdles at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He also won the 60 metres hurdles title at the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Championships, and the 110 metres hurdles titles at the Commonwealth Games in 1982 and 1986. He is the World record holder for the 50 metres hurdles with 6.25 secs (1986), and the Canadian record holder in the 60 metres hurdles with 7.41 secs (1993), and the 110 metres hurdles with 13.08 secs (1993).

==Athletics career==
Born in Georgetown, British Guiana, Mark McKoy spent his youth in England, before moving to Canada as a teenager. He attended Clemson University in 1980, but dropped out.

McKoy came to the international athletics scene in 1982 by winning a gold medal in 110 m hurdles and silver in 4 x 100 m relay at the Commonwealth Games. In the next year McKoy finished fourth at the first World Championships and repeated this place at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

In 1986, McKoy repeated his victory in 110 m hurdles at Commonwealth Games and turned his 4x100 m relay silver to gold medal, but finished seventh at the 1987 World Championships.

McKoy finished seventh in the hurdles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, as he hit a number of hurdles in the final. His compatriot Ben Johnson tested positive for banned substances at the Games. In protest of the rush to judgement and treatment of his friend and teammate, Mark left the Olympic games prior to competing in the 4 x 100 metre relay race. This act led to Mark&#x27;s 2 year suspension from international athletics by the Canadian Olympic Committee. Over the course of the Dubin Inquiry, McKoy testified that as a young man and under pressure from his coach, Charlie Francis, 
he briefly experimented with performance enhancing drugs.

McKoy made a comeback at the 1991 World Championships, finishing fourth again in 110 m hurdles. At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, McKoy put his fourth-place streak behind him and won the gold medal in 13.12 seconds. It was the first Canadian Olympic gold medal in track and field since Duncan McNaughton&#x27;s first-place finish in the high jump competition in 1932 and at the same time, Mark McKoy became the first black Canadian to win an Olympic gold medal. At the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Toronto he won the 60 m hurdles.

A training mate of Colin Jackson, he appeared with Jackson and Linford Christie in the workout video &quot;The S Plan: Get Fit with Christie and Jackson&quot; in 1993.

McKoy had emigrated to Austria and subsequently obtained Austrian citizenship in 1994. He spent the last years of his career competing for his adopted country and set an Austrian record of 13.14 seconds in the 110 m hurdles.

<doc id="949395" wikidata="Q11989277" url="?curid=949395" title="Michael R. White (politician)">
<text>Michael White (born August 13, 1951) is an American politician of the Democratic Party and was the 55th and second longest-serving mayor of Cleveland, Ohio encompassing three four-year terms, from 1990 to 2002. He was Cleveland&#x27;s second African American mayor as well as the city&#x27;s second youngest mayor.

==Early career==
White, who grew up in Cleveland&#x27;s Glenville neighborhood, began his political career early on during his college years at Ohio State University, when he protested against the discriminatory policies of the Columbus public bus system and was subsequently arrested. White then ran the following year for Student Union President and won, becoming the college&#x27;s first black student body leader. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973 and a Master of Public Administration degree in 1974.

After college, White returned to Cleveland. He served from 1976 to 1977 as an administrative assistant to the Cleveland City Council and then served as city councilman from the Glenville area from 1978 to 1984 During his time on the City Council, White became a prominent protégé of Councilman George L. Forbes. White then represented the area&#x27;s 21st District in the Ohio Senate, serving as a Democratic assistant minority whip.

==Mayoralty==
In 1989, White entered the heavily contested race for mayor of Cleveland, along with several other notable candidates including Forbes, Ralph J. Perk Jr. (the son of former Cleveland mayor Ralph J. Perk), Benny Bonanno (Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal Court), and Tim Hagan (Cuyahoga County commissioner). Out of all the candidates, Forbes and White made it to the general election. It was the first time two Black candidates emerged as the number one and two contenders in a primary election in Cleveland history.
In Cleveland, incumbent Mike White won re-election against council president George Forbes, who ran as the candidate of black power and the public sector unions. Angering the unions by eliminating some of the city&#x27;s exotic work rules, White presented himself as pro-business, pro-police and an effective manager above all, arguing that &quot;jobs were the cure for the &#x27;addiction to the mailbox,&#x27;&quot; referring to welfare checks. 
White ended up winning the race, securing &quot;81% of the vote in predominantly white wards and 30% in the predominantly black wards where his opponent, George Forbes, was the strongest.&quot; He was subsequently re-elected mayor in 1993 and 1997.

Some of White&#x27;s accomplishments in office include passing legislation making banks dispel lending policies that were restrictive to minorities, providing leadership for retaining a Cleveland Browns team in the NFL (after then-Browns team owner Art Modell moved to Baltimore with all former Browns players and personnel to form the Baltimore Ravens) as well as building a new stadium for the Cleveland Browns, and construction of the Gateway stadium development. He also declared October 30, 1994 &quot;&quot;Bone Thugs~N~Harmony&quot; Day&quot; in the city of Cleveland to honor the hometown rappers.

White is also credited in saving the Continental Airlines Cleveland Hub. In 1999, Clevelanders and Northeast Ohioans celebrated direct access to London, England with a nonstop air service from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport CLE to London&#x27;s Gatwick LGW. This flight was popular with Cleveland&#x27;s business community and helped Clevelanders bypass the traditional Cleveland-NYC-London connections. Continental ended nonstop London flights in 2009. Continental Airlines in 1997 opened a new Gate D at Hopkins Airport.

Under Mayor White&#x27;s tenure, Cleveland became a tourist spot with the openings of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1995) and the Great Lakes Science Center (1996).

White announced at an informal appearance at Miles Standish Elementary School on April 23, 2001 that he would not seek a fourth term as mayor. When White&#x27;s successor, Jane L. Campbell, assumed office in January 2002, the former mayor retired to an alpaca farm near Newcomerstown, Ohio. In 2012, he was also running the Yellow Butterfly Winery near the same town.

==Controversy==
The White administration was criticized for ignoring or at least underachieving in its aid to residents of the predominantly black neighborhoods. For instance, there was lackluster job training efforts, and it directed none of the enterprise zone development projects to the Hough neighborhood.

Two of White&#x27;s closest associates, Nate Gray and Ricardo Teamor, were convicted and sentenced to prison in connection with bribery scandals. Gray was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for racketeering and extortion; an FBI affidavit depicted Gray as a &quot;bag man&quot; who engaged in a shakedown of city contractors. Teamor pleaded guilty to bribery to former Councilman Joe Jones and cooperated with federal prosecutors, revealing details of corruption in the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport expansion project, which was undertaken when White was mayor. White was targeted in the federal probe of corruption in Cleveland but was never charged with any crime.

<text>Sandra Kay Duncan (born February 20, 1946) is an American actress, comedian, dancer and singer. She is known for her performances in the Broadway revival of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, the sitcom &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;, and the Disney films &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot; and &quot;The Cat from Outer Space&quot;. Duncan has been nominated for three Tony Awards, two Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

==Early life==
Duncan was born on February 20, 1946, in New London, Texas, to Sylvia and Mancil Ray Duncan, a gas-station owner. She spent her early years there before moving to Tyler, Texas, when she was in third grade. She performed in her first dance recital at the age of five.

==Career==
Duncan started her entertainment career at age 12, working in a local production of &quot;The King and I&quot; for $150 a week. In the late 1960s, she appeared in a commercial for United California Bank and in the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; for a brief period in 1968&quot;.&quot;

In 1970, &quot;Time&quot; named Duncan one of the &quot;most promising faces of tomorrow&quot;. Also that year, she starred in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, for which she received favorable reviews. Duncan made her feature-film debut co-starring with Dean Jones in the Walt Disney family comedy &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot;. She was then cast as Amy Cooper in the Paramount film version of &quot;Star Spangled Girl&quot;, based on the Broadway play by Neil Simon. Both films performed poorly at the box office. In autumn 1971, Duncan starred as Sandy Stockton on the CBS sitcom &quot;Funny Face&quot;. The program was placed in the Saturday-night prime-time schedule between &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show.&quot; Critics dismissed the show but praised Duncan, especially &quot;TV Guide&quot; columnist Cleveland Amory, who described her as &quot;a wonderful comedienne.&quot;

Shortly after the premiere of &quot;Funny Face&quot;, Duncan underwent surgery to remove a benign brain tumor behind her left optic nerve. She lost vision in her left eye, but because it still tracked with her right eye, Duncan and her doctors elected to leave it in place. Duncan does not have a glass eye as rumours said. Her recovery from the operation was rapid, but CBS suspended production on &quot;Funny Face&quot; until the following year after the 12th installment had been filmed; the original series pilot served as the 13th (and final) episode. At first, Nielsen ratings for &quot;Funny Face&quot; were low, ranking in the lower 50s, but they eventually climbed to #17, and the show was called the best-liked new show of that television season. Duncan was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series. In September 1972, &quot;Funny Face&quot; returned as &quot;The Sandy Duncan Show&quot;, with a revised format, new writers and a new time slot, Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Critical reaction to the show was similar to that for &quot;Funny Face&quot;, but without the strong Saturday night lead-in of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, the ratings sank. After 13 episodes, CBS canceled the series.

In 1976, Duncan played the title role in a television musical adaptation of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; that featured Danny Kaye as Geppetto and Flip Wilson as the Fox. She also guest-starred in a first-season episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. For her performance as Missy Anne Reynolds in the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, she earned another Emmy nomination.

Duncan then returned to the Broadway stage for many years. In 1979, her run as the title role in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; won her many accolades. She also had replacement roles in &quot;My One and Only&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. She was nominated for a Tony Award three times: in 1969, for Featured Actress (Musical) for &quot;Canterbury Tales,&quot; in 1971, as Best Actress (Musical) for &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; and in 1980, as Best Actress (Musical) for &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

In 1972, an animated version of Duncan (who contributed her own voice) appeared in the &quot;Sandy Duncan&#x27;s Jekyll and Hyde&quot; episode of the CBS Saturday-morning cartoon &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;; forty-eight years later, she reprised her guest star appearance in &quot;The Dreaded Remake of Jekyll &amp; Hyde!&quot; episode of &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot;. In 1976, she guest-starred on &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; playing the role of Gillian in &quot;The Return of Bigfoot&quot; episodes.

In 1978, Duncan starred in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Cat from Outer Space&quot; along with Ken Berry, Harry Morgan and Roddy McDowall. From the mid-1970s through the 1980s, Duncan was the commercial spokesperson for Nabisco&#x27;s Wheat Thins crackers.

In 1981, Duncan voiced Vixey in &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;. In 1984, she starred in a song and dance revue titled &quot;5-6-7-8...Dance!&quot; at Radio City Music Hall and provided voice work for the &quot;My Little Pony&quot; television special &quot;Rescue at Midnight Castle&quot; as Firefly and Applejack. From 1986 to 1987, she reprised her role as Firefly in the &quot;My Little Pony &#x27;n Friends&quot; series. In 1987, she joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Family&quot; (previously known as &quot;Valerie&quot;, later to be retitled &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;) after Valerie Harper was dismissed. Duncan starred as the matriarch&#x27;s sister-in-law Sandy Hogan, who moves in with her brother Mike (Josh Taylor) and his three sons to help raise the family after Valerie Hogan&#x27;s death. She remained with the series through its cancellation in 1991. In 1988, she worked on the first three &quot;Barney and the Backyard Gang&quot; children&#x27;s videos. Duncan was asked to take part in the &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; television series, but declined the offer. In 1991, she voiced Peepers the mouse in the Don Bluth film &quot;Rock-a-Doodle.&quot; In 1994, she voiced Queen Uberta in the Richard Rich film &quot;The Swan Princess.&quot;

From 1999-2001, Duncan co-hosted with Ron Montez the PBS show &quot;Championship Ballroom Dancing&quot;.

In 2003, Duncan appeared in the rotating cast of the Off-Broadway staged reading of &quot;Wit &amp; Wisdom&quot;. In May 2008, she performed one of the lead roles in the musical &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, a production of the City Center&#x27;s annual &quot;Encores!&quot; series. In April 2009, she performed the lead role in the play &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; at Casa Mañana Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas. In September 2009, she played the lead role in Tennessee Williams&#x27; play &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; at the Mountain Playhouse in Jennerstown, Pennsylvania. She has also participated in many traveling stage productions, including &quot;The King and I.&quot;

On February 12, 2016, Duncan took the role of Madame du Maurier in the Broadway production of &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;. On February 17, the show&#x27;s producers announced that she would take a temporary leave of absence because of family obligations.

==Personal life==

Duncan met singer-actor Bruce Scott (born Bruce Scott Zaharaides) during the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Your Own Thing&quot;, and they were married in September 1968. Their divorce, finalized in October 1972, was caused by tensions resulting from Duncan&#x27;s success and rise to stardom. Duncan told &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1979 that &quot;It was very threatening to Bruce.&quot;

Her second marriage was to Dr. Thomas Calcaterra on January 10, 1973; it lasted until 1979. Duncan met Calcaterra when he was a consulting surgeon for her brain-tumor surgery. This marriage also failed, according to Duncan, because of the demands of her 1978 nightclub act and her refusal to remain at home to be a good &quot;doctor&#x27;s wife.&quot;

Since July 21, 1980, Duncan has been married to actor and choreographer Don Correia. They have two sons, born in 1982 and 1984. She and her husband, who performed together on stage before they wed, live in Connecticut.
Taylorville, Illinois (near Springfield) named a street in her honor, Sandy Duncan Drive. Her character in &quot;Funny Face&quot; and &quot;The Sandy Duncan Show&quot;, Sandy Stockton, is from Taylorville.

<text>Manuel Schenkhuizen (), better known as Grubby, is a Dutch internet personality and former professional esports player. He competed in the real-time strategy genre, predominantly playing &quot;Warcraft III&quot; (WC3), &quot;Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne&quot; and &quot;Starcraft II&quot;. Grubby is one of the most successful WC3 players of all time, as an Orc player, having won more than 38 LAN tournaments, of which six were World Championships. His command over the Horde placed him early enough among the elite of the &quot;WC3&quot; players, while his clash with Jang &quot;Spirit Moon&quot; Jae-ho rewarded him with a legendary status among the fans of the game. Grubby is known for being part of some of the most successful &quot;WC3&quot; teams in history, namely the British 4Kings. Later teams include the Danish MeetYourMakers and the North American Evil Geniuses. Grubby is widely regarded as one of the greatest Orc players of all time. Grubby is now a popular full-time streamer on Twitch.

==Esports career==
Grubby has been on three professional teams throughout his career. His stay in Four-Kings (4K) lasted from October 2003 until January 2008. From January 2008 until January 2009 he featured in MeetYourMakers (MYM). In the past, he has formed strong 2 versus 2 teams with Arvid &quot;Myth&quot; Fekken, Yoan &quot;ToD&quot; Merlo and Olav &quot;Creolophus&quot; Undheim. In 2008, 4K discontinued their &quot;Warcraft III&quot; team and all the players went their own way. After the disbanding of the team MeetYourMakers in January 2009, Grubby and his then teammate Jang Jae Ho parted ways. He then joined the team Evil Geniuses in April 2009 with his wife Cassandra &quot;PpG&quot; Ng. He left the team in April 2011 and continues to compete solo. His major tournament victories include the World Cyber Games in 2004, Electronic Sports World Cup 2005, the World Series of Video Games in 2006, the World Cyber Games 2008, World e-Sports Masters in 2009 and e-Stars 2009 – King of the Game, Seoul – South Korea

His accomplishments in the two World Cyber Games victories have led him to be included in the tournament&#x27;s hall of fame. Schenkhuizen is the only WC3 player to have won both the WCG and the ESWC title. He&#x27;s also one of the longest playing professional players of &quot;Warcraft III&quot;. Schenkhuizen is the protagonist in the documentary film &quot;Beyond the Game&quot;.

In 2011, Schenkhuizen moved from &quot;Warcraft III&quot; to &quot;StarCraft II&quot; as a Protoss player.

In 2015, he began casting esports events for &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;, including casting the world championships at Blizzcon 2015 and 2016.

==Personal life==
Schenkhuizen born in a family of Dutch Indo descent. He became engaged to Cassandra &#x27;PpG&#x27; Ng at BlizzCon 2009 and the two married in 2010.

<doc id="949411" wikidata="Q3033769" url="?curid=949411" title="Dogpatch USA">
<text>Dogpatch USA was a theme park located in northwest Arkansas along State Highway 7 between the cities of Harrison and Jasper, an area known today as Marble Falls. It was based on the comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, created by cartoonist Al Capp and set in a fictional village called Dogpatch. The park opened in 1968, and closed in 1993.

Dogpatch USA was a commercial success in its early years. Investors tried to parlay that success into a sister park, &quot;Marble Falls,&quot; planned with a ski resort and convention center. The venture failed and led to the park&#x27;s closure in 1993. The property then fell into disrepair. Parts of the park have been divided up and sold, and the main area has been bought, sold, and foreclosed on several times.

A documentary about Dogpatch USA by Jeff Carter Productions was released in May 2018.

==History==

===Origins===
In 1966, Albert Raney, Sr. decided to sell his family&#x27;s Ozark trout farm and listed it with O. J. Snow, a Harrison, Arkansas, real estate agent. Snow examined the property and decided that the Raney farm was ideal for an amusement park based on pioneer themes, which was an idea he had entertained for years. He noted that features of the area resembled those pictured in the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic strip: he imagined Mill Creek Canyon at the base of a 55-foot (16.8 m) waterfall could be the &quot;bottomless canyon&quot; featured in the comic strip, and the nearby tourist attraction Mystic Caverns (also owned by the Raney family) could become &quot;Dogpatch Cave&quot;, where Kickapoo Joy Juice was brewed by a few unsavory Dogpatch characters.

Snow and nine or ten Harrison businessmen formed Recreation Enterprises, Incorporated (REI) to develop the land. Their first step was to get permission from Al Capp, the creator of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, for a park based on his work. According to an &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; article, Snow sent Capp home movies of the property and descriptions of the attractions. In addition to the trout farm and Mystic Caverns cave, Snow planned a variety of attractions and activities, including horseback riding, paddle boats, train rides, local arts and crafts shops, family-oriented theatrical presentations, a botanical garden, an apiary, and honey and fudge shops. &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic-strip characters would roam the park and perform skits for the patrons. Snow also assured Capp that the park would be quiet and dignified and would not include roller coasters or thrill rides that would conflict with the rustic &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; theme. Capp, who had turned down other offers to use his characters in theme parks, accepted this one and became a partner, claiming he had once driven through the Ozarks and had pictured just such an area for the setting of his fictional &quot;Dogpatch&quot; town. On January 4, 1967, an article in the &quot;Northwest Arkansas Times&quot; stated that Capp&#x27;s attorneys were finalizing the agreement. Capp approved of the plans for the park and granted REI the rights to use his characters.

Some state officials and Arkansas residents objected to the creation of the theme park because they thought that it would encourage negative hillbilly stereotypes. Lou Oberste of the Publicity and Parks Commission expressed reservations, and Commission Director Bob Evans agreed that Arkansas had difficulty shedding a similar image created by comedic actor Bob Burns.

In January 1967, Edwin T. Haefele of the Brookings Institution and Leon N. Moses, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University, were in Arkansas attending the Central Arkansas Urban Policy Conference. When reporters asked for their opinions of the Dogpatch project, they expressed doubts about the likelihood of its success, citing the failure of other theme parks that had popped up trying to replicate Disneyland&#x27;s great success. They also felt that such theme parks tend to cause nearby property values to deflate and local businesses to relocate to more desirable areas. Despite these reservations, the Publicity and Parks Commission toured the property and decided to support the project, and the Harrison Chamber of Commerce approved the plans for the 825 acre (3.3 km2) park. In comparison, Disneyland originally called for only eight acres.

===Building and opening the park===
Al Capp and his wife attended the ground-breaking ceremony on Tuesday, October 3, 1967. Phase I of the project, at a cost of $1.332 million, included construction of the initial buildings and rides. A second phase, which included the construction of a train from Dogpatch to Marble Falls, a tram from the parking lot to the park entrance, the &quot;Skunk Hollow&quot; section of the park, a motel, and a golf course, was planned to be completed over the next two years at a cost of $2 million. In 1968, the name of the community post office was officially changed from Marble Falls to Dogpatch.

Under the direction of Jim Schermerhorn, an REI board member and experienced caver, Mystic Caverns, which was renamed &quot;Dogpatch Caverns&quot;, was completely renovated. Dangerous conditions were corrected to ensure safety, and the additions included a better lighting system, walkway, and entrance. During renovation, while Schermerhorn was operating the bulldozer, a second cave was discovered next to Mystic Caverns. Realizing the potential value of this pristine cave, he had it blocked off so that it could be preserved untouched. It was named &quot;Old Man Moses Cave&quot; and put on the &quot;to do&quot; list along with the other projects intended for Phase II. Schermerhorn also acquired several authentic 19th century log cabins in the Ozark Mountains and had them dismantled, shipped, and reconstructed in the park. A watermill that had originally operated on the property circa 1834 was restored and made fully operational.

Dogpatch USA opened and welcomed about 8,000 visitors on May 17, 1968. The centerpiece of the park was a giant statue of the fictional town hero, Jubilation T. Cornpone. Capp unveiled the statue during his dedication speech to a crowd of about 2,000. Kim Capp, son of Al Capp, worked as the assistant Public Relations Director. General admission was $1.50 for adults and $0.75 for children. During the first year, the park&#x27;s attractions included a railroad, surrey rides, trail rides, a stable, an apiary, a grist mill tour, a slide, a petting zoo, and a &quot;mule swing&quot;. Fishing in the trout pond was another activity offered; the Dogpatch restaurant could then cook the trout for visitors. Artisans demonstrated their work, including candlemaking, glassblowing, and woodcarving, and local crafts were available for purchase, including handmade dulcimers, smoking chips, and embroidered aprons, though crafts produced elsewhere supplemented the local products. The &quot;alpine-style&quot; Dogpatch Inn provided accommodations for visitors. The park reported a net profit of about $100,000 at the end of the 1968 season.

Attendance expectations for the park were, in retrospect, extremely optimistic. David Wesley and Harrison Price of the Los Angeles consulting firm Economic Research Associates projected 400,000 patrons in the first year. They projected that within 10 years, annual attendance would exceed 1 million and annual revenue would be $5 million. However, Dogpatch USA hosted only 300,000 visitors in 1968. Estimates of attendance in its subsequent years have varied widely. According to a February 9, 1997, article in the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;, it never reported more than 200,000 visitors in any subsequent year. However, according to an August 10, 1997, article in the same newspaper, &quot;in the early 1970s, the park was attracting almost a million visitors each year.&quot;

=== Jess Odom ownership ===
A disagreement arose among the members of REI with regards to investing the profits of the first year. Snow believed all the profits should be reinvested in the park, but the other members wanted to divide some of it among themselves. Jess Odom, an Arkansas businessman in search of an opportunity, bought REI members&#x27; shares for $750,000 and gained a controlling interest in the park in October 1968. Odom had been successful in several other endeavors, including the founding of a planned community northwest of Little Rock called Maumelle. In summer 1968, there were plans to expand the park further in time for next season&#x27;s opening; the planned attractions were the &quot;Skunk Holler&quot; section, new shops, and more &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;-themed performances.

Odom signed a long-term licensing agreement with Capp, giving the park and any future &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; franchises the rights to use all characters, events, jargon, names, and titles until 1998. In return, Capp would receive two to three percent of the gross of admissions over the same time period.

According to some sources, in 1969, the cave discovered during construction, &quot;Old Man Moses Cave,&quot; was opened to park visitors. However, according to Mystic Caverns&#x27; owners, the Old Man Moses Cave was never opened to the public while it was part of Dogpatch USA. Also in 1969, the first annual Miss Dogpatch pageant was held in the park. During that time, Orval Faubus, former governor of Arkansas, served as the president of Dogpatch USA. Also in 1969 the B-movie &quot;It&#x27;s Alive!&quot; was partly filmed at the Dogpatch Theme park.

1969 marked a particularly popular year for rustic and hillbilly pop culture. Shows such as &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; were in vogue on American television, and a similar rustic-themed park about 40 miles away near Branson, Missouri, Silver Dollar City, had become a huge success. The &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic strip was appearing in more than 700 newspapers daily throughout the country, which kept the fictional town of Dogpatch in the public eye. In 1968, Al Capp had granted New York restaurant chain Longchamps, Inc. the rights to use his characters and artwork in a planned &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;-themed restaurant franchise. Capp had also approved the creation of a &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner TV&quot; series, and the Dogpatch USA operators hoped the park and series would mutually build each other&#x27;s audiences.

Dogpatch USA was profitable in its first few years, and Odom expanded the park&#x27;s amenities. By the 1970 opening day, a motel consisting of 60 mobile-home units had been completed, and a funicular to carry guests from the parking lot to the park entrance was a few weeks away from completion. In 1971, Odom, who foresaw unlimited potential for the park, bought out most of the remaining investors for $700,000 and became, essentially, the owner. Several new attractions were added in time for the 1972 season opening, including an &quot;Animal World&quot; section with a sea lion exhibit and an aviary with exotic birds, a children&#x27;s water ride, and, as stated by the &quot;Harrison Daily Times&quot;, a &quot;unique boat train ride.&quot;

In August 1972, Odom announced that he was financing the construction of a sister park, Marble Falls Resort and Convention Center, which was the first ski resort in Arkansas. The two parks were marketed together as a year-round attraction. The resort was ready for the Christmas season of 1972, though a winter storm prevented it from opening until after Christmas. The resort used snow machines to produce enough snow for skiing; the anticipated skiing season was December to mid-March. Marble Falls Resort and Convention Center included ski slopes, a toboggan run, an ice-skating rink, the 62-unit Marble Falls Inn, 36 condominiums, and 30 rental alpine chalets, though the condos and chalets weren&#x27;t completed until after the initial opening. Odom also opened the Antique Auto Museum as part of the Marble Falls complex.

Odom also continued to expand Dogpatch USA. New attractions during the 1973 season included a go-cart track named Pappy Yokum&#x27;s Positively Petrifying Putt-Mobiles, a scrambler called Joe Btfsplk&#x27;s Impending Disaster Machine, a shooting gallery called Scraggs Feudin&#x27; Range, a black light maze, and a swinging bridge. The Kissin&#x27; Rocks sculpture was also newly installed for the 1973 season. In 1974, more new attractions were added, including the thrill ride Hairless Joe&#x27;s Kickapoo Barrel, an inflatable &quot;bouncing bag,&quot; a replica Native American village, and craft shops where artisans demonstrated pottery making, leather working, and woodworking.

Success seemed to be on the horizon for Odom and Dogpatch USA, but the many unforeseen events of the 1970s cast a dark shadow on Odom&#x27;s dreams. Attendance figures throughout that decade were woefully short of expectations. In 1973, interest rates began to skyrocket, and a nationwide energy crisis kept many tourists home. In a bout of cancellations nicknamed the Rural purge, American television networks eliminated many shows with country themes, and the popularity of hillbillies waned. The &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; restaurant chain was never built. The proposed &quot;Li&#x27;l&quot; Abner TV series was never made; a pilot was produced and premiered as a television special on ABC-TV, but it received poor reviews and no network purchased the series.

The mild winter weather which visited Arkansas through the mid-1970s proved to be the undoing of Marble Falls as a ski resort, and its snow cannons and slopes sat idle much of the time. The modest profits of Dogpatch USA were not sufficient to keep the two parks afloat, and Odom, already $2 million in debt, was forced to borrow an additional $1.5 million in the unfavorable financial atmosphere of 1973.

In 1974, Odom partnered with the Department of Speech and Dramatic Arts at the University of Arkansas to create an in-park repertory theater in a venture called &quot;Arkansas Rediscovered&quot; or the American Revolution Bicentennial Project. The group of student performers was named the &quot;Boar&#x27;s Head Players.&quot; Odom and the university planned for the group to perform well-known plays and short children&#x27;s productions and to develop new plays based on the history and culture of Arkansas. They planned for the new plays to premiere at Marble Falls in 1976 as part of the United States Bicentennial celebration, and then the group would tour the state performing the new works. This venture turned into a huge disappointment; the group presented two of the five promised productions, and did not return for any of the following seasons. Today, this troupe is still active at the University of Arkansas.

In 1976, Union Planters Bank began foreclosure proceedings on $3.5 million in debts. In 1977, Al Capp and the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic strip retired. Capp&#x27;s retirement brought an end to one of the greatest advertisements for Dogpatch USA – the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic strip. The same year, First National Bank of Little Rock began foreclosure proceedings on $600,000 in debts. In September of that year, Odom stated that, because Marble Falls had lost $50,000 to $100,000 a year since it opened, the ski slopes would be closed permanently. In subsequent years, various activities, including grass skiing, a gaming arcade, a 400-foot water slide, and a disco, were advertised at Marble Falls along with the resort accommodations. New attractions included the Slobbovian Sled Run, Grist Mill Puppet Theater, Rottin&#x27; Ralphies Rick-o-shay Rifle Range, and Barney Barnsmell&#x27;s Skunk-works. New attractions in 1978 included Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s Space Rocket, which was intended to simulate a flight into space.

Two personal injury lawsuits, seeking more than $200,000 in compensation, were brought against Dogpatch USA in 1979 and settled in 1980. By 1979, Dogpatch USA&#x27;s income was less than its operating expenses, and attempts by Odom to get the town of Harrison, and later Jasper, to issue tourism bonds to refinance millions of dollars of debt were unsuccessful. That same year Odom announced that negotiations had been underway to sell the park to a private nonprofit group called God&#x27;s Patch, Inc., which would turn Dogpatch USA into a Biblical-themed amusement park, but funding never materialized. New attractions in 1980 included a trained bear act, Castle&#x27;s Country Bears, and the Shmoo, a character from the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic strip, which appeared for the first time among the park&#x27;s costumed characters.

The heat wave of 1980, one of the worst in Arkansas&#x27;s history, made that year one of the worst for the park and marked the second consecutive year that Dogpatch USA operated without sufficient income. In October 1980, Union Planters Bank filed to take possession of both Dogpatch USA and Marble Falls. A month later, Dogpatch USA filed for bankruptcy. Union Planters Bank put Dogpatch USA up for sale in order to pay off $7 million&#x27; worth of loans.

=== OEI ownership ===
In 1981, Ozarks Entertainment, Inc. (OEI) bought Dogpatch USA for an undisclosed amount; it would retain ownership through 1986. Taking the park in new directions, OEI, under the leadership of General Manager Wayne Thompson, reduced the park staff by more than 50% and added many attractions. The amphitheater hosted concerts featuring stars such as Reba McEntire, Hank Thompson, and Ike and Tina Turner.

Thompson also brought in the corporate sponsorship of Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, and Tyson Foods, and superheroes including Spider-Man, Batman and Robin, and Captain America for personal appearances and autograph signing. Gospel and bluegrass shows were presented. Denver Pyle (Uncle Jesse from the popular TV series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;) was signed as the park&#x27;s spokesman both onsite and in TV commercials. Dogpatch admission was relatively cheap compared to other theme parks around the country; a &quot;Money&quot; magazine survey in 1986 found that admission for a family of four was $34 at Dogpatch, while it was $84 at Disney World.

In 1981, Dogpatch Caverns and Old Man Moses Cave were sold to Bruce Raney (grandson of Albert Raney, Sr.) and a fellow investor. Old Man Moses Cave was renamed &quot;Crystal Dome&quot; and &quot;Dogpatch Caverns&quot; became &quot;Mystic Caverns&quot; again. According to Mystic Caverns&#x27; owners, the Crystal Dome was subsequently renovated and opened to the public for the first time in August 1981. Managed by Raney until they were sold to Omni Properties, Inc. in 1984, the twin caves continue to operate as tourist attractions.

In the 1980s, the ownership of Marble Falls was divided and changed until it became so entangled in legal problems that it was impossible to clearly identify who actually owned each part of the property. In 1982, Odom, under the name &quot;Buffalo River Resorts,&quot; began selling parcels of the resort for timeshares and condominiums; however, in June 1983, The Arkansas Time Share Act made it illegal to sell the timeshares because the banks held liens on the property. A 1984 court ruling created an exception for Buffalo River Resorts, although buyers had to be informed that the banks held liens on the property and thus could hypothetically repossess the timeshares if Odom&#x27;s companies failed to pay their debts. This was followed by a drop in timeshare sales.

=== Telcor ownership ===
In 1987, The Entertainment and Leisure Corporation (Telcor) purchased a 90% stake in OEI. The other 10% was retained by Herb Dunn, Lynn Spradley and Jerry Maland, residents of the area. Telcor, a corporation formed to buy and manage theme parks and headed by Melvyn Bell of Bell Equities, owned two other parks at the time, Deer Forest Park in Coloma, Michigan, and Magic Springs in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Wayne Thompson, who was general manager of the park, became President of Telcor with Sam Southerland as Vice President. Thompson and Southerland were principal owners of OEI, and Southerland actually managed the finances for all three Telcor parks. Under Thompson&#x27;s leadership Telcor made renovations and improvements, and a new ride called the &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; was added.

In 1988, Wayne Thompson departed, and Lynn Spradley, a Dogpatch USA veteran of 14 years, became GM and managed the park through the 1991 season. During this time Spradley bemoaned the fact that Dogpatch USA was forced to spend much more per patron on promotional strategies to attract visitors than other theme parks, and that most kids did not know who the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; characters were. By this time the comic strip had been out of print for more than 10 years.

Dogpatch USA floundered in the face of stiff competition in the Telcor years, especially from Silver Dollar City, which duplicated most of what Dogpatch USA offered but on a grander scale, and was an hour&#x27;s drive to the north. What Silver Dollar City lacked, the Ozark Folk Center (a fully subsidized state park) in nearby Mountain View provided, and neither park was wrapped in an outdated cartoon franchise.

In 1991, after concerns from civic leaders that the park would not open for the 1991 season due to financial problems, it was indicated that if the park opened at all, it would open as a scaled down arts and crafts park. General admission was eliminated; patrons paid for each individual attraction instead. Telcor decided to save the money that the Capp estate was receiving for use of the name and characters, and with that one of the most distinctive aspects of the park – the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; theme – was completely dropped and the name changed to Dogpatch, Arkansas.

The park was closed permanently on October 14, 1993.

== Post-closure ==
On December 20, 1994, the park was put up for auction on the courthouse steps in Jasper. The auction was handled by Jim Sprott, a Harrison lawyer whose wife Jan had been &quot;Daisy Mae&quot; at Dogpatch USA from 1968 through the 1970 season; Sprott himself had played Earthquake McGoon and Luke Scraggs. C.L. and Ford Carr of Leisuretek Corporation and Westek Corporation received a quit claim for the property. At that time, however, they neglected to do anything with the park.

In 1988 Debra Nielson began buying parcels of the Dogpatch property. Eventually the area she owned included the ski lodge, convention center, roller rink, and motel. She renamed the acreage &quot;Serenity Mountain&quot;. She moved into the Ski Lodge and operated a bed and breakfast there. She also opened a nondenominational church in one of the abandoned resort buildings. In December 1999 Nielson leased the abandoned skating rink to the Humane Enforcement and Legal Protection or HELP. HELP was a non profit group that provided therapeutic horse back riding free of charge.

In 1997, in response to a petition by residents, the U.S. Post Office changed the name of the Dogpatch Post Office back to Marble Falls, as it had been prior to 1968.

In November 2001, the park&#x27;s owner at that time, Melvyn Bell, was indicted by a federal grand jury for tax evasion. The trial was delayed repeatedly, due to Bell&#x27;s health issues, and ultimately dismissed when he died January 2002. Security Bank of Harrison foreclosed on the Dogpatch USA property in order to recover $485,000 in debt from Bell.

In late 2002, Ford Carr had the site placed on eBay with a minimum bid requirement of $1 million. Although he was looking for a $4 million bid, there were no bidders. In 2005, it was reported by &quot;Arkansas Business&quot; that the property was for sale with an asking price $5 million, but the price was &quot;very negotiable.&quot;

In 2005, 17-year-old Pruett Nance was driving an ATV through the property. Nance said he had permission from the owners to tour the property. While riding, Nance collided with a length of wire strung between two trees, and was severely injured and nearly decapitated. The question of whether or not the wire was put there maliciously, to dissuade vandalism, became the subject of a lawsuit the Nances filed against the park&#x27;s owners. The suit eventually ended up in the Arkansas Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Nance. Nance was awarded $100,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in punitive damages, and his father, Stewart Nance, was awarded $400,000 in compensatory damages, for medical bills. When the park owners did not pay the judgment, the deed to Dogpatch was awarded to Pruett Nance, who became the new owner of the park.

A few businesses have revived sections of the Marble Falls property. Nielson sold some of the property to Fred Mullins, who opened an RV Park on the site of the former campgrounds. In 2004, Nielson sold another portion of the property, including the convention center, motel, restaurant, ice-skating rink, and a strip mall to Bob Richards and Randal Phillips. Phillips and his wife Debbie reopened it as &quot;The Hub&quot;, a motorcycle-themed resort. The Hub featured a 50-room hotel and a convention facility that seated 1,500 in theater style. The Hub closed in 2017.

=== Bud Pelsor Ownership ===
On August 13, 2014, what was left of the park was sold again, this time to Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Pelsor, the inventor of a &quot;spill-proof&quot; dog bowl, and his partners for $2 million. Pelsor, who had recently purchased much of the surrounding land, announced that he planned to reopen the park as an ecotourism village. On December 8, 2014, the park was opened to the public for the first time since it had closed 21 years earlier. That weekend, over 5,000 visitors toured the property in anticipation of a grand opening date in the future. Pelsor&#x27;s plans included restoring the stream, trout farm and mill, featuring music performances, and opening a restaurant. The reopened park, he said, would be named the Village at Dogpatch.

Three buildings burned on the Dogpatch Grounds on February 22, 2015; the buildings were a total loss. Newton County, Arkansas, officials have deemed the incident &quot;suspicious&quot;. No one was reported to be injured in the blaze.

On May 16 and 17, the park was opened to the public for a second time. Several music groups performed, and artisans from around the Ozarks demonstrated and sold their crafts.

In March 2016, Pelsor put the park up for sale for $3 million, explaining that his business partner, James Robertson, wanted to sell his share of the park, but Pelsor could not afford to buy him out. Pelsor said he would happy to remain co-owner by selling just half the park to a new business partner.

In December 2017, Pelsor announced that he had reached an agreement to lease the park to Heritage USA, Inc., a company owned by David Hare (not to be confused with Heritage USA, a Christian theme park by the same name in South Carolina that closed in 1989). Hare intended to develop the property into Heritage USA Ozarks Resort at Historic Dogpatch beginning in March 2018. However, on August 20, 2018, Debra Nielson, the hotel&#x27;s owner, filed a lawsuit in Newton County Circuit Court to evict David Hare from her property. The park became once again abandoned. Pelsor stated that Hare had fallen behind on lease payments. Even though he was continuing to make YouTube videos advertising the park, and vacationers had paid and left deposits on hotel rooms, the hotel was vacant and utilities were cut off, while Hare and Heritage USA had become unreachable. Court filings with Pulaski County Circuit Court show that Heritage had agreed to pay $5,500 a month for use of the property and in fact had never paid anything, in addition to not paying for insurance on the property which had also been cancelled, leading to what Nielson described as an emergency situation. It also alleges an inspection showed &quot;significant damage to the premises.&quot; Nielson&#x27;s attorney has stated that a process to serve Hare with legal papers has been ongoing, but so far he has exhausted all means available to him to find Hare.

On December 15, 2019, Pelsor was served with a foreclosure notice. Owing $922,000 on a $1 million promissory note supposed to be paid off earlier in August that year, and also facing a lawsuit, he decided to leave the state.

=== Johnny Morris and Bass Pro Shops=== 
The park was planned to be put up for auction on the Newton County courthouse steps on March 3, 2020, but a &quot;Motion to Cancel Foreclosure Sale&quot; was filed in Newton County Circuit Court on February 27. The Nances, who still held the mortgage on Dogpatch, postponed the auction for two months pending contract negotiations with a new buyer. On June 5, 2020, paperwork was filed at Newton County Circuit Court in Jasper indicating the park had been sold for $1.12 Million. The new owners were listed as Down By the Falls LLC, a corporation created in Delaware but with a Springfield, Missouri, street address.

By August 2020 the new owner had been revealed as Johnny Morris, founder of Bass Pro Shops. He expressed his desire to take time and restore the park, though did not reveal specific plans saying only everything was in the early stages and that it would be &quot;An ode to the heritage of the Ozarks and the abundant wildlife and natural beauty found here&quot;.

On September 28, 2021, Bob Ziehmer, senior director of conservation for Bass Pro Shops, presented a plan to the Buffalo River Conservation Committee, held in the Jasper School Cafeteria. The proposed plan will be to create a smaller version of the Dogwood Canyon Nature Park in Lampe, Missouri, which features a working mill, restaurant, trout fishing, fly-fishing lessons, wildlife tours, horseback riding, and education programs on conservation. 

==Attractions==
Trout Pond - Park visitors could rent fishing equipment and go fishing in the pond, which was deliberately overstocked so it would be easy to catch fish. Visitors could fish as much as they wanted and only had to pay for the fish they caught. The Dogpatch restaurant could prepare and serve guests&#x27; caught fish, or Dogpatch workers could clean and pack the fish in ice for guests to take home.

The pond was part of a trout farm that was operated by Albert Raney and his family beginning in the 1930s. In 1966, Raney sold the Trout Pond to the developers of Dogpatch USA, but the Raneys continued to operate the pond.

Dogpatch Caverns - A nearby show cave that was incorporated into the park. It had been a tourist attraction since the late 1920s, and in 1949 it was purchased by the Raney family and named Mystic Caverns. It was sold to the developers of Dogpatch USA in 1966, who renamed it &quot;Dogpatch Caverns.&quot; The cave was renovated and many safety issues were addressed. During renovations a second cave was discovered adjacent to it; it was named &quot;Old Man Moses Cave&quot; after a &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; cartoon character, and barricaded to preserve its pristine condition. According to some sources, &quot;Old Man Moses Cave&quot; was open to visitors in the 1969 season. Both caves were sold in 1981. &quot;Dogpatch Caverns&quot; was renamed &quot;Mystic Caverns&quot; once more, &quot;Old Man Moses Cave&quot; was renamed &quot;Crystal Dome,&quot; and, according to the current owners of the caves, it was at this time that &quot;Old Man Moses Cave&quot; was finally opened for tours.

Peter Bella Grist Mill - This was a historic mill originally built on the property in 1834. It was restored during the initial construction of Dogpatch in 1968. It fell into disrepair after the park&#x27;s closure.

West Po&#x27;k Chop Speshul- This was a miniature train with passenger cars. It carried guests on a circular track around the park. At the time of its construction, it was the first and only railroad in Newton County, Arkansas.

Cornvention Center - This was a venue where musical performances were given.

Frustratin&#x27; Flyer - This was a steel Wild Mouse roller coaster. It was a &quot;Monster Mouse&quot; model manufactured by the Allan Herschell Company. Installed in 1968 for the park&#x27;s debut, it operated until 1991. Dogpatch USA brochures after 1973 continued to show a Monster Mouse in operation. The mouse was sold between the 1991 and 1992 season.

Earthquake McGoon&#x27;s Brain Rattler - This was a toboggan roller coaster by Chance Rides. The ride was part of the park when it was opened in 1968. In early brochures it was depicted as being a track wrapped around an enormous tree, but the ride was actually made of metal. Since 1993, the ride has operated as the Wild &amp; Wooly Toboggan at Little Amerricka amusement park in Marshall, Wisconsin.


Funicular Tram - A &quot;decliner inliner&quot;, the tram was used to transport visitors from the parking lot into the park below. It was purchased from an unknown manufacturer in Switzerland and shipped to Dogpatch USA at a cost of $250,000. Installed in 1970 and opened at the beginning of the 1971 season, it could transport 1,700 guests per hour at a speed of . As passengers descended into the Dogpatch USA valley they were given a short monologue about the park over the tram&#x27;s PA system.

Boat Train Ride - This ride was introduced at the beginning of the 1972 season. A motorized lead boat piloted by a Dogpatch employee pulled a train of non-motorized boats behind it. The boats followed a route going up creek to the Grist Mill and back again.

Hairless Joe&#x27;s Kickapoo Barrel - This ride was introduced in the 1974 season. It was a rotating thrill ride.

Barney Barnsmell&#x27;s Skunk Works - This was introduced in 1977. It was a building full of complicated contraptions reminiscent of Rube Goldberg&#x27;s designs. The machinery&#x27;s purpose was the production of homemade soap; the &quot;Springfield News-Leader&quot; referred to the attraction as the &quot;Skunk Works Soap Factory.&quot;

Slobbovian Sled Run - This was introduced in the 1977 season. Guests rode on sleds mounted on teflon runners. The sled run was intended to operate similarly to a waterslide but without water.

Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s Space Rocket - The ride was added in 1978. It was a simulated trip into outer space.

Trash Eaters - The park had trash cans equipped with huge animal heads that &quot;ate&quot; (sucked) the trash out of patrons&#x27; hands. The heads were shaped like goats, pigs, and even razorbacks, and the unusual design encouraged patrons to properly dispose of their litter by making it an amusing experience. The trash eaters used an unusual design. There was a blower motor inside the trash eater &quot;house.&quot; The inside of the &quot;house&quot; was sealed so that when the door was shut, a vacuum was created which sucked trash into the trash eater&#x27;s mouth. The trash then hit a stop and fell into the trashcan located inside the trash eater &quot;house&quot;.

Dogpatch Cabins - Guests could tour several cabins that were the &quot;homes&quot; of various Li&#x27;l Abner characters. These included Mammy and Pappy Yokum&#x27;s house and Li&#x27;l Abner and Daisy Mae&#x27;s house. Some of the cabins were authentic cabins from elsewhere in the Ozarks that had been purchased and rebuilt at the park during its 1968 construction.

Dogpatch Auto Drive - These &quot;antique&quot; cars were gas powered, 5/8 size, Ford Model T cars made by Arrow Development. This ride was part of the park when it opened in 1968. There were seven cars in total (two red, two yellow, and three white). The track was made of asphalt with wooden railings around the track. On Oct. 26, 2015, a local family from Bergman, Arkansas, purchased all seven cars from an independent seller.

<doc id="949413" wikidata="Q2884150" url="?curid=949413" title="Holne">
<text>Holne is a village and civil parish on the southeastern slopes of Dartmoor in Devon, England. A community has existed here since at least the 11th century, and today a population of around 250 people is served by a church and a public house, the Church House Inn.

==Village==
The Church of St Mary the Virgin was built circa 1300, and was enlarged early in the 16th century. Around this time a carved and painted rood screen was installed, together with a matching pulpit of unusual design. A hollow yew tree in the churchyard was thought to have been planted around 1300. Nearby is a prominent cross, with an octagonal cross section, which marks the grave of the Rev. John Gill, who was vicar of Holne from 1858 to 1917—his 90th year.

The novelist and clergyman Charles Kingsley was born in the vicarage while his father was curate-in-charge here for a few months.

==Parish==
The eastern and northern boundaries of the parish are formed by the River Dart. To the west it is bordered by the parish of Dartmoor Forest, the boundary partly following the O Brook. It meets the northernmost point of Buckfastleigh parish at Petre&#x27;s Bound Stone on Ryder&#x27;s Hill, one of the highest points on southern Dartmoor. From here the boundary runs back east to the River Dart.

Holne Chase Castle is a well-preserved Iron Age hill fort on the top of Holne Chase, which is an area of steep woodland in the loop of the River Dart between two medieval bridges: Holne Bridge and New Bridge. In the north of the parish, the farmstead of Stoke was a Domesday manor.

==Manor==
The manor of Holne was listed in Domesday Book of 1086 as the 11th of 17 Devon holdings of William of Falaise. The lands of William of Falaise later became the feudal barony of Dartington, whose lords were the FitzMartin family, feudal barons of Blagdon in Somerset. From the FitzMartins Holne descended to the Audley family, feudal barons of Barnstaple, thence to the Bourchiers, lords of the manor of Tawstock, thence to their heirs the Wrey baronets. In 1850 Sir Bourchier Palk Wrey, 8th Baronet (1788-1879) had a hunting seat in the manor named Holne Chase House &quot;in a singularly romantic situation&quot;. To this was attached Holne Chase, 500 acres of wood and 2200 acres of moor land extending about 2 miles into Dartmoor Forest, &quot;amidst some of the most magnificent scenery in Devon, where the River Dart is seen foaming over its rocky bed, between steep and shelving banks, and lofty woody hills&quot;. In 1850 Sir Bourchier Palk Wrey, 8th Baronet, owned most of the parish, including the hamlets of Michelcombe and Stoke and a number of scattered farms, also the hunting boxes called Holne Park and Holne cottage.

Several paintings of the Wrey estate were made by Frederick Christian Lewis (1779–1856) published in London, 1821 as &quot;Scenery of the River Dart&quot;, as follows:

*Holne. Scene from Cumston, the property of Sir B.Wrey, Bart. / drawn, engd. &amp; pubd. by F.C.Lewis, London 1820.

*Holne. Scene below Holne Cottage, the property of Sir B.Wrey, Bart / drawn, engd. &amp; pubd. by F.C.Lewis, London, 1820.
In 1885 Sir Bourchier Toke Wrey, 10th Baronet (1829-1900) sold the estate to Hon. Richard Maitland Westenra Dawson (1845-1914), 3rd son of Richard Dawson, 1st Earl of Dartrey. The Dawsons lived in the mansion house of Holne Chase but then built a new mansion nearby called Holne Park, to which they moved. In 1890 Holne Chase was let to Rev. Charles Foster, after whom a Salmon Pool on the River Dart is named. In 1934 Holne Chase operated as a Hotel, which closed in 2008. In the year 1914 Richard died on 7 August aged 69 and three months later his son Capt. Richard Long Dawson (1879-20 November 1914) of the Coldstream Guards was killed in action ay Ypres during World War I (his name appears on the parish War Memorial and his gravestone is in the Zillebeke Churchyard Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery) Richard I&#x27;s widow Jane Dawson (d.1932) retained possession but in 1937, 5 years after her death, her executors sold the estate to Stephen Simpson of nearby Spitchwick Manor, Poundsgate. Following the closure of Holne Chase Hotel in 2008 and the termination of the lease, the owners Mr and Mrs Richard Simpson made it their home and converted the stable block and garden cottage into holiday lets.

<text>Ralph Sidney Locher (July 24, 1915 – June 18, 2004) was a Romanian-born American politician of the Democratic Party who served as the 50th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio.

==Life and career==
In 1915, Locher was born in the oil-producing Romanian town of Moreni, northwest of Bucharest. His father, a Swiss-American, represented Standard Oil in the country from 1906. His mother was a Regat German native to Romania. The family left for the United States in 1928, after the father retired.

Locher graduated from Bluffton College and was admitted to the Ohio bar. He became a close associate of Frank J. Lausche, later Governor of Ohio and U.S. Senator, who nurtured his career, first appointing him as secretary of the Ohio State Industrial Commission in 1945. They were instrumental in building the &quot;cosmopolitan Democrats&quot; movement of urban ethnic voters. Locher was law director of Cleveland under Mayor Anthony J. Celebrezze beginning in 1953, then succeeded him as mayor when Celebrezze was appointed United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare by President John F. Kennedy on July 14, 1962. Ohio Attorney General Mark McElroy was expected to win the Democratic nomination in the primary election held on October 2, but Locher won the nomination in an upset. Locher easily won election to the remainder of Celebrezze&#x27;s term in a general election held on November 6.

After completing Celebrezze&#x27;s fifth term, Locher served two full terms of his own as mayor of Cleveland. In 1965, Locher banned all rock concerts at Public Hall and other city-owned venues following a near-riot at a Rolling Stones performance. His tenure was marked by increasing racial tensions in the city, culminating in the Hough Riots of 1966. On April 25, 1967, Locher declared that three recent visitors to the cityFloyd McKissick, national director of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), Alabama governor George C. Wallace, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.were &quot;extremists.&quot;

On October 3, 1967, Locher lost the Cleveland Democratic primary election to Carl B. Stokes, who he had narrowly defeated in the 1965 general election. Stokes went on to defeat Republican Seth Taft in the general election, becoming the first African American mayor of a major U.S. city.

Locher went on to be elected a probate court judge in 1970, and was elected to the Ohio Supreme Court in 1977, serving two terms. Though a Democrat, he became increasingly conservative as he got older and with longevity in office frequently voting with Republican justices on worker&#x27;s compensation and other employment issues.

<text>Six Flags Over Georgia is a amusement park in Austell, Georgia, United States. Opened in 1967, it is the second park in the Six Flags chain following the original Six Flags Over Texas, which opened in 1961. 

Six Flags Over Georgia is one of three parks in the Six Flags chain to have been founded by Angus G. Wynne. As with other Six Flags parks, it features themes from the Warner Bros. Entertainment library, including characters from Looney Tunes and DC Comics.

==History==
===Development===

After the success of his original Six Flags Over Texas park in Arlington, Texas, park founder Angus Wynne began searching for a location for a second park, looking mainly in the Southeastern United States, with initial design work on the park starting in 1964. In August 1965, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Wynne&#x27;s development company, Great Southwest Corporation, had purchased of land along the Chattahoochee River outside of Atlanta for a planned $400 million industrial park with an adjacent $7 million amusement park. The land chosen was the site of the oldest permanent agricultural village in Georgia, home to Muscogee farmers from 200 BC to 500 AD. During development of the park the mounds were destroyed without being studied. The park itself sits on former dairy farm land known as Cole Brothers Dairy. The Cole Brothers sold their farm to Six Flags in the mid-1960s

Wynne hired former Hollywood art directors Randall Duell and Hans Peters to develop the park, then named &quot;Georgia Flags&quot;. Like its sister park in Texas, the design and theming of Six Flags Over Georgia was inspired by six different flags that have flown over the state (or, perhaps more accurately, the lands that are now part of it) during its history. The two states shared the connections to Spain, France, Confederate States of America, and the U.S.; for Georgia, Great Britain would replace Mexico, and the flag of the state of Georgia would replace that of Texas, even though Georgia was never a sovereign nation, as Texas once was. When Six Flags Over Georgia opened in 1967, Six Flags became the first theme park operator in the United States to operate parks at multiple locations.

===The 1960s===
Six Flags Over Georgia opened to the public on June 16, 1967. Attractions first available included the Log Jamboree log flume ride, Jean Ribaut&#x27;s Adventure (a boat tour similar to Disney&#x27;s Jungle Cruise attractions), the Six Flags Railroad, two driving attractions (the Happy Motoring Freeway and the Hanson Cars), two Satellite flat rides, the Tales of the Okefenokee dark ride, the Casa Loco tilt house, the Sky Lift/Astro Lift cable car and the park&#x27;s first roller coaster, the Dahlonega Mine Train. The park&#x27;s live entertainment offerings included a dolphin show, the Krofft Puppet Theater and the Athenaeum, later renamed the Crystal Pistol.

After a successful first season, plans were set in motion to expand the park, and adjustments were made to existing attractions based on visitor feedback. A second Log Jamboree flume was added, a new show debuted in the Krofft Puppet Theater and the effects inside the Tales of the Okefenokee were upgraded with the help of Krofft Studios. The park relocated Casa Loco out of its Spanish fort to make way for the Horror Cave haunted house attraction; a new adjacent building was built for Casa Loco&#x27;s effects, which would become Casa Magnetica. However, the largest improvement was the addition of the park&#x27;s first new section, Lickskillet. Located outside the park&#x27;s railroad tracks and named after a Georgia mining town in the late 19th century, Lickskillet added three new rides — the Spindle Top (a Rotor flat ride, the Wheel Burrow (a Chance Tumbler) and the Sky Buckets, the park&#x27;s second cable car ride — along with several craft shops and a shootout show performed on the street. In 1969, Six Flags added still more attractions, the Sky Hook observation tower, which was relocated from Six Flags Over Texas, the Mini Mine Train, the park&#x27;s second roller coaster and the Chevy Show domed theater building.

===The 1970s===
In the early 1970s, Six Flags began augmenting its supply of costumed characters with creations from various Sid &amp; Marty Krofft television series. Characters from &quot;H. R. Pufnstuf&quot; began appearing in the park in 1970, with characters from &quot;Lidsville&quot; added in 1972. The 1970 production in the Krofft Puppet Theater was based on &quot;H. R. Pufnstuf&quot;, as well. These characters left the park after the 1974 season as Krofft decided to open its own amusement park, The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, in downtown Atlanta. In Lickskillet, the Drunken Barrels flat ride had replaced the Wheel Burrow, and in 1972 Six Flags debuted the fully-restored Riverview Carousel on a hilltop adjacent to the section. This carousel, purchased from the defunct Riverview Park in Chicago, was built into a pavilion modeled after its original home.
For the 1973 season, Six Flags added its second park expansion, the Cotton States Exposition, a development four years in the making. In 1969, general manager Earl McKoy first proposed that the park install a wooden roller coaster, an idea to which Angus Wynne wasn&#x27;t very receptive. By 1971, however, the concept was approved, and designer John C. Allen and the Philadelphia Toboggan Company were contracted to design the ride, which opened in 1973 as The Great American Scream Machine. The Scream Machine, the largest roller coaster in the world at the time, was the anchor attraction for the Cotton States area, which was inspired by the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition. In 1974, Six Flags added two new rides, the Mo-Mo the Monster Octopus ride in the USA section and the Phlying Phlurpus spinning ride in Cotton States; Mo-Mo would later move to Cotton States, as well. The Spanish section received a number of children&#x27;s rides for the 1975 season. After the end of that season, the Happy Motoring Freeway was removed to make way for the Great Gasp parachute drop, which would be the park&#x27;s new attraction for 1976.

*1977: Added Wheelie (Schwarzkopf Enterprise)
*1978: Added Mind Bender.
*1979: Added Highland Swings (Chance Yo-Yo)

===Present day===
In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed themeing from attractions. They terminated several licenses including their license with Thomas the Tank Engine. Thomas Town was renamed and rethemed to Whistlestop Park in time for the 2011 season. In an arrangement similar to that for Six Flags Over Texas, it is owned by a group of approximately 120 limited partners—some the heirs of Angus G. Wynne—and is managed by the corporation. In years past, this has caused significant friction, including legal action. Starting in 1991, the park was managed by Time Warner Entertainment. The partners sued Time Warner in 1997, claiming that they had neglected to invest in the park and overcharged the partners for the improvements it did receive. A Gwinnett County civil court jury agreed and awarded the partners damages in excess of US$600 million. In 1998, Time Warner sold its interests in the Six Flags parks to Premier Parks of Oklahoma City, which later changed its name to Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc.

On August 29, 2013, Six Flags officially announced it would add a Hurricane Harbor water park next door to the park for the 2014 season. In late April 2014, the park announced that it will expand their season from October to January, to include the new Christmas event, Holiday in the Park for years to come.

As part of Six Flags&#x27; 2015 capital investment program, Six Flags Over Georgia received two rides in its Gotham City section. The first, &quot;The Joker: Chaos Coaster&quot; is a Larson Giant Loop ride approximately 70 feet in height, while the second, &quot;Harley Quinn Spinsanity&quot;, is a more traditional Tilt-A-Whirl family ride. Both attractions were part of a broader renovation of Gotham City, which also included a new character meet-and-greet area and improvements to the existing Gotham City Eatery restaurant.

In 2016, Six Flags added two new children areas to the park – Bugs Bunny Boomtown and DC Super Friends, the first in the Six Flags chain. On June 16, 2016, it was announced that Dodge City Bumper Cars would be closed and removed from the park to make room for a new ride in 2017. On September 1, 2016, the park announced that an all new dark ride named Justice League: Battle For Metropolis would replace Dodge City Bumper Cars.

In December 2024, Six Flags announced that they would take full ownership on the park and White Water from its partners for $332 million, of which the transition will occur at the beginning of January 2027.

==Rides and attractions==
Six Flags Over Georgia, like most amusement parks, prides itself on its roller coaster collection. Goliath and The Riddler Mindbender routinely rank among the top steel roller coasters listed by &quot;Amusement Today&quot; magazine in its Golden Ticket Awards. The collection expanded most recently in 2025 with the addition of Georgia Gold Rusher, the world&#x27;s first Ultra Surf roller coaster from Intamin.

Aside from the roller coasters, Six Flags Over Georgia maintains a large number of other rides and attractions. Two attractions of note are Acrophobia, installed in 2001 as the world&#x27;s first &quot;floorless&quot; freefall tower ride, and the Riverview Carousel.

===Riverview Carousel===
Riverview Carousel is one of only three remaining five-abreast carousels known to exist. Located in an area of the park commonly referred to as Carousel Hill, The Riverview Carousel opened at the park in 1972. It is a 1908 PTC Carousel and is located in the Cotton States section after being moved from Riverview Park in Chicago. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 27, 1995.

The Matador Ride replaced the Fort Cannons where guests would fire wax cannonballs out of cannons in front of the fort at a model of another fort in the little stream that flowed in front of the fort. Part of the stream was partially filled in (with a small pedestrian bridge crossing the remaining part of the stream) to place this ride in the park. This allowed for a new pathway (going between The Matador and Jumping Frijolies rides) that tied the kiddie section into Carousel Hill. On this path a Puppet Show wagon (similar to the Buford Buzzard wagon) was added. The petting Zoo was altered removing the Pyramid structure from over the entrance way.

Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;Shirt Tales&quot; characters are the park mascots for the season (apparently hanging in the next season as well even though the Looney Tunes start their takeover), as a result they move into the Character Theatre in the kiddie section. The Contemporary Theatre is renamed the Olympic Theatre.
*1985: Added Looping Starship. The attraction was removed after the end of the season because it was on a ride rotation schedule with other Six Flags parks.

==Incidents==

Over the years, a number of incidents have occurred at the park, including some fatalities. has been the scene of two fatal incidents nearly identical in nature, where individuals were underneath the attraction while it was operational and were struck and killed by the train itself or by the riders&#x27; exposed legs.

Portions of Six Flags Over Georgia lie within the flood plain of the Chattahoochee River, which has caused occasional problems whenever the river overflows its banks. Most recently, in September 2009, the park suffered severe flooding, as did much of the surrounding area. The bulk of the flooding occurred during the week, at a point in the season when the park was closed on weekdays. The park managed to clean up the damage and open as normal the following weekend.

On opening day of the 2024 season, police were called to the park by Six Flags Over Georgia security to help disperse &quot;a sizeable unruly crowd&quot; of 500 to 600 people &quot;running through the park and fighting&quot;, Cobb County police said in a statement. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations, multiple people began shooting, hitting an unoccupied CCPD marked patrol car. During the incident, one CCPD officer fired his weapon, striking a 15-year-old who was subsequently charged with criminal conduct.

<doc id="949463" wikidata="Q2637123" url="?curid=949463" title="Gun fu">
<text>Gun &quot;fu, a [[portmanteau]] of &quot;[[gun]]&quot; and &quot;[[kung fu]]&quot; (also known asgun &quot;kata, bullet ballet, gymnastic gunplay or bullet arts), is a style of sophisticated close-quarters gunfight resembling a martial arts combat that combines firearms with hand-to-hand combat and traditional melee weapons in an approximately 50/50 ratio. It can be seen in Hong Kong action cinema, and in American action films influenced by it.

The focus of gun &quot;fu&quot; is both artistic style and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand (usually paired with jumping to the side at the same time), dual wielding, shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as melee weapons (usually knife fights) are all common. Other moves can involve submachine guns, assault rifles, combat shotguns, rocket launchers, and just about anything else that can be worked into a cinematic shot. It is often mixed with grappling maneuvers.

Gun &quot;fu&quot; has become a staple of modern action films due to its visual spectacle, a result of often impressive choreography and stuntwork, regardless of its unrealistic elements when compared to real-life gun warfare.

==Hong Kong origins==

As the name suggests, gun &quot;fu&quot; has roots in martial arts films from Hong Kong action cinema, including &quot;wuxia&quot; films and &quot;kung fu&quot; films from the likes of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. These films typically involved martial artists fighting large numbers of enemies in stylized choreographed action set-pieces, with a fighting style that lay somewhere between brawling and dancing. Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, who began his career directing martial arts films, took the martial arts style of action and added guns, combining the elegance and precision of &quot;kung fu&quot; with the brutality and violence of gangster films.

John Woo originated the style that would later be called gun &quot;fu&quot; in the 1986 Hong Kong action film &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. The film launched the &quot;heroic bloodshed&quot; genre in Hong Kong, and gun &quot;fu&quot; action sequences became a regular feature in many of the subsequent heroic bloodshed films, which combined the elegance and precision of &quot;kung fu&quot; with the brutality and violence of gangster movies. John Woo continued to make several classic heroic bloodshed films, all featuring gun &quot;fu&quot;, and all starring leading man Chow Yun-fat.

Anthony Leong wrote of the gunfights in &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;,
Stephen Hunter, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote,
Other Hong Kong directors also began using gun &quot;fu&quot; sequences in films that were not strictly heroic bloodshed films, such as Wong Jing&#x27;s &quot;God of Gamblers&quot; (1989) and its sequel &quot;God of Gamblers Returns&quot; (1994). There were several heroic bloodshed films that did not feature gun &quot;fu&quot;, but opted for more realistic combat, such as Ringo Lam&#x27;s &quot;City on Fire&quot; (1987).

==Spread to the United States==
The popularity of John Woo films, and the heroic bloodshed genre in general, in the U.S. helped give gun &quot;fu&quot; greater visibility. Some of the earliest Hollywood productions not directed by Woo that adopted the style were &quot;Desperado&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; (1998), the latter starring Chow Yun-fat.

The success of &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) helped to popularize and develop the style in the U.S. One classic gun &quot;fu&quot; move consists of reloading two pistols simultaneously by releasing the empty magazines, pointing the guns to the ground, dropping two fresh magazines out of one&#x27;s jacket sleeves, or strapped to one&#x27;s legs, into the guns, and then carrying on shooting. The style is also featured, albeit in a small way and with the assistance of gadgets, in &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001). In &quot;Equilibrium&quot; (2002), the law enforcement responsible for handling &quot;Sense Crime&quot; are trained in &quot;gun &quot;kata&quot;&quot; to gain an advantage in their raids on armed opponents. In the film &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; (2003), The Monk With No Name (portrayed by Yun-fat) empties two pistols, ejects the magazines and spins to kick the empty magazines at his assailants. This was parodied in an episode of &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; (Season 1, Episode 19 &quot;Tactical Village&quot;). &quot;Underworld&quot; (2003) brought The Matrix&#x27;s aesthetic from the cyberpunk subgenre into the dark fantasy realm, including its gunplay. In &quot;Wanted&quot; (2008), assassins belonging to The Fraternity possess the skill of &quot;bending&quot; bullets around obstacles; in a gunfight early in the film, one assassin knocks another bullet out of the air with his own round. In &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; (2009), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) reloads his handguns by throwing them into the air and catching them with the magazines he is holding in his hands.

In the 2010 film &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, the character Hit Girl, played by Chloë Grace Moretz, frequently uses gun &quot;fu&quot;. In the 2012 film &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, the climactic shootout in Candieland is inspired by John Woo, replicating scenes from his 1989 classic &quot;The Killer&quot; shot-by-shot. The 2013 &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot; utilized gun &quot;fu&quot; in the climactic fight between Roadblock and Firefly. The style is also heavily featured in 2014&#x27;s &quot;John Wick&quot;, as well as 2015&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

A gun &quot;fu&quot; sequence involving Chris Redfield and Glenn Arias is showcased in the 2017 CGI film &quot;Resident Evil: Vendetta&quot;. Although produced in Japan, the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise takes the majority of its inspiration from American horror and action cinema.

==Other media==
===Video games===

* Planned for release in 2025, SPINE is a cyberpunk action beat &#x27;em up game that highlights gun fu style combat as one of its key features.

===Comic books===
&quot;Gun Fu&quot; is also the name of a series of comic books by Howard M. Shum and Joey Mason, about a Hong Kong police officer in the 1930s who employs a combination of gun-play and martial arts.

===Pen-and-paper games===
It is not certain where or when the actual term &quot;gun &quot;fu&quot;&quot; was invented. One of the earliest written records exists in the tabletop role-playing game &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; which was first published in 1988.

Gun &quot;fu&quot; is a form of specialized martial arts usable in the game and is described as,

&quot;Conspiracy X&quot;, another tabletop RPG first published in 1996, also included the combat style as a usable skill. In this game, gun &quot;fu&quot; allowed players&#x27; characters to use firearms in close combat and skilled martial artists to string together combinations of moves.

In the Buffyverse role-playing games, gun &quot;fu&quot; is the name for the firearms skill, but this is more likely meant to be humorous rather than to imply characters practice an actual firearm-based martial art.
In the &quot;Ninjas and Superspies&quot; supplement &quot;Mystic China&quot;, gun &quot;fu&quot; is the Triad assassin training, and is a martial arts skill that can be available to player characters. It primarily emphasizes the use of paired 9mm pistols.

In &quot;Run &amp; Gun&quot;, a expansion of the fifth-edition of the pen-and-paper role-playing game &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, gun &quot;fu&quot; is a combat style available.

The &quot;GURPS&quot; roleplaying system has a &quot;Gun-Fu&quot; supplement, written by S.A. Fisher, Sean Punch, and Hans-Christian Vortisch.

===Television===
In the Japanese series &quot;Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger&quot;, Banban &quot;Ban&quot; Akaza a.k.a. DekaRed is specifically mentioned as a master of gun &quot;fu&quot; technique, which in the series is called as &quot;Juu Kun Do&quot; ( is the Japanese word for &#x27;gun&#x27;, and the name of the style is a play on Jeet Kune Do). As a result, the mecha for the series, Dekaranger Robo, is also sometimes shown using gun &quot;fu&quot;. The American adaptation of the series, &quot;Power Rangers S.P.D.&quot;, also shows the Red Ranger Jack Landors and the Delta Squad Megazord using the same technique, though that was more because of the source material – Jack is not specifically mentioned as being a master of gun &quot;fu&quot;.

In the anime &quot;Mazinkaizer SKL&quot;, Ryou Magami (one of the two pilots of the titular Mazinkaiser) uses gun &quot;fu&quot; as his primary style of combat as he wields the Breast Triggers, a pair of handguns which store on Mazinkaiser&#x27;s chest. Magami&#x27;s fight scenes contain several visual homages to the film &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, including a scene in the first episode where Mazinkaiser performs the signature pose of the Grammaton Clerics.

<text>Six Flags Fiesta Texas, formerly known simply as Fiesta Texas, is an amusement park in San Antonio, Texas, United States. It opened on March 14, 1992, in the La Cantera master-planned development and district as the first business in that development. Spanning , the park was originally built to become a destination musical show park with its focus on the musical culture of the state of Texas. The park was purchased by Time Warner in 1995, and branded as a Six Flags park for the 1996 season.

The park&#x27;s landmark is the Scream drop tower ride which stands 205 feet tall and can be seen from all around the park as well as outside the property. The vibrant colors of the ride along with the Fiesta Texas signage make it visible to guests approaching from the intersection of Loop 1604 and Interstate 10. A good portion of the park is hidden within the quarry, however, several other attractions, including portions of most of the park&#x27;s roller coasters are visible from outside the park.

==History==
Before Fiesta Texas opened in 1992, the site was part of the Redland Quarry which began operation in 1934. By 1988, the limestone in the portion where Six Flags Fiesta Texas is located was depleted and the land was available for development.

The development team consisted of property owner USAA Real Estate Company, a subsidiary of the USAA insurance company and Gaylord Entertainment Company, a company that owned Opryland USA, a theme park in Nashville, Tennessee. When the initial ownership group began investigating a possible major theme park development in San Antonio, Texas, they faced significant competition in the Texas market. There were similarly established Six Flags parks in Arlington and Houston. Based on the competition, the development team believed the opportunity in San Antonio (an established regional leisure destination) was there and that the stable, slow growth direction of the theme park industry in the U.S. was in their favor.

The concept plan and master plan were developed by FORREC International based in Toronto. FORREC handed over a detailed design of the project to San Antonio-based architecture and engineering groups: Benham/Jones Kell and Pape Dawson. Actual construction of the theme park took approximately 23 months, running from early 1990 to the park&#x27;s opening in March 1992. Construction of the theme park was overseen by a joint venture of two general contractors, Lyda Inc. of San Antonio and Manhattan Construction Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The park had four theme sections; Crackaxle Canyon, Los Festivales, Spassburg and Rockville, along with a water park called, Ol&#x27; Waterin&#x27; Hole. In its third season, 1994, Fiesta Texas added a new themed area, Fiesta Bay Boardwalk, with multiple new rides and attractions including a Ferris wheel, swinging ship, scrambler, and a roller-skating pavilion.

Time Warner took over management and operations of Fiesta Texas in 1996 and added the Six Flags name to the park, while USAA remained as the sole owner. Six Flags Fiesta Texas added its third roller coaster, a Vekoma Hurricane named The Joker&#x27;s Revenge, which opened to the general public on May 10 of the same year. It was the park&#x27;s first roller coaster to go upside down and the first ride to be based on DC Comics. The Joker&#x27;s Revenge featured a funhouse queue line and trains that traveled backward through the course.

Premier Parks, which acquired the Six Flags theme park chain from Time Warner, purchased Fiesta Texas from USAA in October 1998. In 1999, Fiesta Texas saw the biggest expansion ever in park history with more than 10 new rides and water rides, as well a rename of the water park to Armadillo Beach. With the infusion of new rides, the park saw its annual attendance increase by more than one million visitors. Also in 1999, Six Flags Fiesta Texas was awarded &quot;Amusement Today&#x27;s&quot; Golden Ticket Award for Best Shows in the theme park industry. The park continued to receive the award every year until 2008.

In March 2006, Six Flags Fiesta Texas expanded its water park and renamed it White Water Bay. The rehab included a redesigned plaza, new food and merchandise facilities and four new waterslide attractions.

The Six Flags company began the process of removing licensed theming company wide across its theme parks from attractions that the park had built in previous years. Six Flags Fiesta Texas had to rename and retheme seven rides as well as the kids theme area from Wiggles World to Kidzopolis, all in time for the 2011 season.

In 2019, the park for the first time in its history, operated at a year-round schedule. Before 2019, Fiesta Texas ran their operating seasons from March to the end of the year. In 2019, the park opened up a new theme area, DC Universe, which included most of the already established DC Comics themed rides, along with the brand new, Joker Carnival of Chaos.

A day before the park&#x27;s 28th anniversary (March 13, 2020), Six Flags suspended all operations across all its properties due to concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the time of closure, the park donated its food and supplies to a local hospital and food bank. On June 4, Six Flags announced the park would reopen on June 19 to members and season pass holders, and to the general public on June 22.

On July 28, 2021, plans were announced for the park&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebration in 2022 which will begin with a New Year&#x27;s Eve Kickoff Event. Plans include a retheme of the popular Poltergeist roller coaster, a Celebrate 30 Night Show, food festivals, displays, a mini-museum, and a new B&amp;M Dive Coaster, Dr. Diabolical&#x27;s Cliffhanger. The latter ride officially opened on July 30, 2022.

==Areas==

Six Flags Fiesta Texas is currently divided into six themed areas along with an adjacent water park, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor

===Los Festivales===

Los Festivales is a Spanish-themed area that guests first encounter upon entering Six Flags Fiesta Texas. It was one of the original themed sections when the park opened in 1992 and is dedicated to the rich Hispanic culture that is integral to San Antonio.

Among the first things upon entering Los Festivales from the front gate is Chupacabra, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard inverted roller coaster, which dominates the visible skyline. The area also features , a Vekoma Boomerang which is seen as the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of the area. Los Festivales is home to two theater venues, the Teatro Fiesta and the Zaragoza Theatre.

The Zaragoza Theatre is known for the park&#x27;s most popular shows during the summer months, as well as a special Halloween show during the park&#x27;s annual Fright Fest event and &quot;The Majesty of Christmas&quot; during Holiday in the Park. Los Festivales is also the location of the eSix gaming arena.

===Crackaxle Canyon Steampunk District===

Crackaxle Canyon is themed after a 1920s Texan boomtown. It can be entered from neighboring areas Los Festivales and Spassburg. The area is home to Iron Rattler, the tallest roller coaster in the park and the first Rocky Mountain Construction roller coaster to have an inversion, as well as six other attractions such as Road Runner Express, an Arrow Dynamics Mine Train; Dr. Diabolical’s Cliffhanger, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard Dive coaster; and The Gully Washer, an Intamin river rapids water ride. 

The area also includes the Whistle Stop train station for the Fiesta Texas Railroad and Dare Devil Dive Flying Machines, a 48-foot-tall Super Air Race ride by Zamperla. 

Crackaxle Canyon is home to Lone Star Lil&#x27;s Amphitheater. The outdoor venue is known for &quot;Mayor Slayer&#x27;s Monster Mash Bash&quot;, a show during Fright Fest, and a host site to watch the end-of-the-day fireworks during the summer months.

Crackaxle Canyon features several eateries: Bubba&#x27;s River Cafe and Old Blue&#x27;s BBQ, which offer indoor and outdoor seating. Thirsty Buffalo Saloon serves food and alcoholic beverages indoors. Chop Six, which serves Asian cuisine, and Totally Kickin&#x27; Chicken, both have outdoor seating. There are also several snack and beverage stands.

The newest area in the park. The star attraction is a 168-foot (51 m) tall Floorless Coaster themed to the DC Comics superhero Superman. This area also includes The Joker Carnival of Chaos, a 172-foot-tall pendulum ride by Zamperla, and Kid Flash Cosmic Coaster, a steel dual-tracked roller coaster made by Skyline Attractions. Kid Flash Cosmic Coaster is the only racing roller coaster in Texas. This DC universe expansion replaced the old Kidzopolis kids&#x27; area, which also included the Funtime Star Flyer, Supergirl Sky Flight.

===Spassburg===

Spassburg is themed after a German village and is dedicated to German heritage in Texas.

The village is home to Bugs&#x27; White Water Rapids, a Hopkins Rides log flume. Spassburg is also home to two theater venues, Sangerfest Halle and a character encounter building.

Sangerfest Halle is home to many shows throughout the year as well as a food court offering a wide range of food. Spassburg has a sit-down restaurant that cater to the area, Sangerfest Halle.

===Rockville===
Rockville is a fictional town themed to the 1950s. Rockville can be entered from Spassburg with a railroad crossing at both of the entrances. The area is home to , the world&#x27;s first S&amp;S Sansei 4D Free Spin roller coaster as well as eight other attractions such as Poltergeist, a Premier Rides launch coaster, Wonder Woman Golden Lasso Coaster, the world&#x27;s first Rocky Mountain Construction single-rail roller coaster, and Scream, a trio of S&amp;S Sansei drop towers. Rockville is home to Rockville High, an indoor theater that is themed to a high school. The area has two sit-down restaurants that cater to the area — Pete&#x27;s Eats and Primo&#x27;s Pizzeria.

===Fiesta Bay Boardwalk===
Fiesta Bay Boardwalk is themed to a boardwalk setting. The area is the only area of the park that has an entrance before entering the boardwalk. The boardwalk is home to Pandemonium, a spinning roller coaster, and seven other attractions. Fiesta Bay Boardwalk was established in 1994 and was the last themed expansion area created in the park. The planks of the boardwalk were replaced in 2016 and the area was updated. Fatburger (formerly Johnny Rockets) is the only restaurant on the boardwalk.

===Hurricane Harbor San Antonio===
Hurricane Harbor can only be entered from within the theme park at Crackaxle Canyon. The water park is home to more than 15 water slides and attractions including a massive wave pool in the shape of Texas. The newest attraction, Thunder Rapids Water Coaster, opened in 2017 as the world&#x27;s tallest, longest and fastest ProSlide RocketBlast waterslide. It opened with the park in 1992 as the Ol&#x27; Waterin&#x27; Hole. It was renamed Armadillo Beach in 1999, then renamed again in 2006 to White Water Bay. The water park is included with park admission. In March 2023, it was renamed to Hurricane Harbor San Antonio.

==Live entertainment==
Six Flags Fiesta Texas has featured numerous forms of in-park entertainment throughout its history. The park generally has kept the theme of the shows to the location of the theater, such as Rockin&#x27; At Rockville High show (a 1950s style show) at the Rockville High School Theater.

Guests of the park are welcomed by a wide array of characters and performers such as characters from the Looney Tunes universe to the superheroes of DC Comics. From 2009 to late 2010, another brand of characters from the Wiggles would also greet guests in the park, before Six Flags had dropped the license to carry on the brand.

==Annual events==
Six Flags Fiesta Texas hosts a number of events for different holidays all throughout the operating season that often draws thousands of visitors to the park.

* Mardi Gras (January–February), a New Orleans–style Mardi Gras celebration throughout the park, first introduced in 2017. A nightly parade with employees of the park and park-goers on many themed floats.
* Fright Fest (September–October) takes over the park with ghouls and monsters that wander around the park for the Halloween season. From Thrills by Day to Fright by Night, the park hosts themed live shows, scare zones and haunted houses. In 2020, the park reimagined their Halloween event to Hallowfest, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The change from Fright Fest to Hallowfest, includes no haunted houses and indoor shows.
* Holiday in the Park (November–January), transforms the park during the Christmas season with millions of different lights scattered throughout the park. From Santa Claus to themed rides such as Frostee&#x27;s Skating Rink. Started as &quot;Lone Star Christmas&quot; in the 1990s before the cancellation of the event after the 1997 season, but was reinstated for the 2007 season.

<text>Edward Blythin (October 10, 1884 – February 14, 1958) was an American politician and jurist of the Republican party who served as the 46th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio.

==Life and career==
Blythin was born October 10, 1884, in the small village of Newmarket in Flintshire, Wales, United Kingdom. His father was a farmer. Relatively well-educated, he became a bookkeeper for a coal company in Wales.

In 1906, he emigrated, ending up in Cleveland, Ohio, where he landed another bookkeeping job, for a real estate agency, a job he held for 10 years. During this time, he attended Cleveland State University College of Law at night, earning his law degree in 1916.

Blythin then turned to the practice of law. In 1935, Blythin accepted appointment as an assistant to the Cleveland city law director. He became law director in 1940. In January 1941, when Harold H. Burton resigned as Cleveland mayor in order to take a seat in the United States Senate, Blythin, as law director, automatically succeeded Burton to the mayor&#x27;s office. In November, however, Blythin failed to win election to the seat, losing to Democrat Frank Lausche.

In 1943, Blythin left private law practice to accept an executive position at Western Reserve University.

In 1949, Blythin was elected to a judgeship in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, where he served until his death. During his tenure on the court, Blythin presided over the notorious 1954 murder trial of Sam Sheppard. His stewardship of the trial was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court which termed the trial &quot;a Roman Holiday.&quot; In fact, famous columnist Dorothy Kilgallen reputedly wrote that in a private conference just prior to the trial beginning, Blythin told her, in his opinion, Sheppard was guilty. According to friends and family members, this private conference never occurred but was Ms Killgallen&#x27;s retaliation for the judge admonishing her for showing up late and disrupting the court proceedings. However, the appellate record contains affidavits signed by others who claimed to have heard Judge Blythin make statements similar to the statement Killgallen claimed to have heard.

==Personal life and death==
Blythin married Jane Rankin on April 3, 1913, and they had five children, Robert, Arthur, Glen, Jane, and William.

Judge Blythin suffered a severe heart attack at his home in Parma Heights, Ohio, on February 12, 1958. He was admitted to Lutheran Hospital in Cleveland, where he suffered a second heart attack and died on February 14. He was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

<text>Purfleet-on-Thames is a town in the Thurrock unitary authority, Essex, England.

It is bordered by the A13 road to the north and the River Thames to the south and is within the easternmost part of the M25 motorway but just outside the Greater London boundary. It was within the traditional Church of England parish of West Thurrock. Some industry is located to the south and the area forms part of the Thames Gateway redevelopment area. Purfleet is one of seven conservation areas in Thurrock.

== History ==
The place-name &quot;Purfleet&quot; is first attested in 1285, where it appears as &quot;Purteflyete&quot;. It is recorded as &quot;Pourteflet&quot; in the Close Roll for 1312. The name means &quot;Purta&#x27;s stream or tidal inlet&quot;.

In the 18th century, Purfleet Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established as a location for the storage of gunpowder together with a garrison to protect it. A constant danger of explosion as a result of lightning strikes existed. Benjamin Franklin was asked for advice on the design of a lightning conductor and a committee of the Royal Society supported his design for pointed conductors. After the American Revolution the powder store was protected from lightning which hit the building, though metal drainpipes actually did the work. When King George III heard of this, he insisted they be replaced with blunt conductors and the president of the Royal Society was forced to resign.

Magazine number 5, the only one remaining of the original five, is now the Purfleet Garrison Heritage and Military Centre and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is run by volunteers and contains a wide range of local and military memorabilia (including items from RAF Hornchurch) and is open to the public on Thursdays, Sundays and bank holidays.

J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851) made sketches of Purfleet in 1805–08 mainly featuring the Powder Magazines. The sketches are collected in the River and Margate Sketchbook which are part of the Tate Britain collection and accepted as part of the Turner Bequest in 1856.

Other surviving 18th-century buildings include the proofing house (now used for community activities) and the gatehouse clock tower (described by English Heritage as forming &quot;an integral part of the finest ensemble in any of the Ordnance Yards, consistent with the high standards practised by the Ordnance Board in its designs for fortifications and barracks from the C17&quot;).

In his history of Essex (1848) W. White describes Purfleet as having 704 inhabitants including 199 from the barracks. &quot;Purfleet is a village and military station...at the mouth of a rivulet, and at the west end of West Thurrock ... sometimes called a township ... and has a pleasure fair on the 13th of June. Near it are the extensive limeade chalk pits of W.H. Whitbread, the lord of the manor. The harbour is often full of shipping business and animation: and joining it is a large government powder magazine, consisting of five detached bomb-proof and well-protected store-houses, barracks for a company of artillery, a store keeper&#x27;s mansion, and a good quay. The magazine was built in 1781, and has room for the safe keeping of 60,000 barrels of gunpowder.&quot;

In March 1916, anti-aircraft gunners based at Purfleet shot down the German Zeppelin LZ 48 (also listed as L15) — the first airship to be destroyed by anti-aircraft artillery. In recognition of their achievement, the gunners received a prize from the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Christopher Wakefield.

From 1921 to 1936, Purfleet formed an urban district of Essex, including the parishes of Aveley, West Thurrock and South Ockendon. It covered an area of and in 1931 had a population of 8,511. The parishes and urban district were abolished in 1936 and their former area was used to form part of Thurrock Urban District.

Reflecting its importance as a seaport and storage depot, Purfleet was listed by the Ministry of Food as one of 14 sensitive A-bomb targets in 1955, including an entrepot for the import of tea.

In Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, first published in 1897, Count Dracula purchased the fictional house called &quot;Carfax&quot; in Purfleet, which was next to a lunatic asylum.

In 2020, after a two-year campaign, the town&#x27;s name was officially changed to Purfleet-on-Thames in an attempt to improve its fortunes and attract more investment.

== High House Production Park ==
In 2006 Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation initiated a project to regenerate High House, Purfleet by renovating historic farm buildings dating from the 16th century and encouraging the development of some creative-industry buildings on the 14-acre site.

The Royal Opera House&#x27;s Bob and Tamar Manoukian scene-making facility for its operas and ballets opened on the High House site in December 2010, followed by a Costume Centre in 2015. Creative &amp; Cultural Skills opened The Backstage Centre at the park in March 2013. The Backstage Centre now houses the national headquarters of Creative &amp; Cultural Skills. In July 2013 ACME Studios, opened 43 artist studios in the park.

== Industry ==
Purfleet has been the site of a Unilever (formerly Van den Berghs &amp; Jurgens) factory producing Stork, Flora, Bertolli, and ICBINB! margarine since 1917, reputed to be the largest in the world. It is the location of an Esso lubricants plant, a roll-on/roll-off ferry (RORO) terminal, and the head office of Carpetright, the UK&#x27;s largest flooring company. It is also home to Scania GB Ltd&#x27;s largest European workshop/office.
