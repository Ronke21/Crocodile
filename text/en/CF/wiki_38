<text>&quot;Lessons&quot; is the first episode of the seventh season of the television show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The episode aired on UPN on September 24, 2002. Dawn finds vengeful spirits in the new Sunnydale High while Giles is rehabilitating Willow in England.

== Plot ==
In Istanbul, a dark-haired girl is pursued through an arched hallway by two people in hooded cloaks. After trying various escape routes, she is trapped in a dead-end. She sees a drain pipe and uses it to scale the building, barely escaping the duo and easily climbing up to the roof. There, another hooded figure is waiting and pushes her off the building. She screams, but she lands on the ground alive, on her back. Two hooded figures hold her down, yet she fights back. A third figure raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and stabs her.

Buffy is in Sunnydale training her sister how to fight vampires. She instructs Dawn that fighting and slaying are about power. They discuss the fact that Sunnydale High has just reopened; Dawn will be attending for the first time. Xander, who is working construction at Sunnydale High, notes that the principal&#x27;s office is right over the Hellmouth. Buffy follows Dawn into the school where she meets Principal Robin Wood.

Buffy goes into a bathroom, where she finds a mysterious talisman. Upon seeing the talisman, she sees a dead girl who threatens her. She says Buffy was unable to protect her, and that she will not be able to protect Dawn either. Buffy tries to warn Dawn, but ends up only embarrassing her in front of her whole class. Dawn then sees a similar dead student. She hurries to the bathroom where she meets Kit Holburn, who has also been seeing things. They are about to leave the bathroom when the floor caves in and they wind up in the high school basement. Dawn and Kit run into another student in the basement, Carlos Trejo, who says he saw a dead janitor. They are soon confronted by the three dead people, who tell them that everyone dies in Sunnydale, and they will be no different.

Dawn calls Buffy on her cell phone. Buffy descends into the basement to help Dawn, only to run into the three dead people herself. After a brief conversation (the dead girl, for example, says that she &quot;was ripped to death by a werewolf&quot;), Buffy realizes that the three dead people are trying to prevent her from going through a certain door. Buffy makes it to the door on her second try. She opens the door, but instead of finding Dawn and the other two students, Buffy finds a deranged Spike. Once Buffy locks the dead people out on the other side of the door, she realizes Spike is frail and unwell. She asks him about a series of cuts on his chest, and he replies that he tried to &quot;cut it out&quot;. Before their conversation can continue, Dawn calls Buffy again. In spite of Spike&#x27;s mad rambling, he is able to tell Buffy that the dead students are not zombies or ghosts, but actually manifest spirits controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance. Buffy tells Dawn to find a weapon because the spirits are corporeal, and then leaves Spike alone, seeing that he is in no shape to help her.

Buffy then calls Xander and tells him to seek and destroy the talisman. Buffy follows Dawn&#x27;s screams to another room in the basement, where she finds Dawn has made a weapon from a purse filled with bricks. Dawn throws the weapon to Buffy, who then fights the spirits off as Xander wrestles with one in the bathroom after locating the talisman. Xander breaks it and the spirits disappear.

Back in the school proper, Buffy sends Dawn, Kit, and Carlos off to class with some words of advice. Wood is impressed that Buffy is able to convince Kit and Carlos, the only two students with school records as long as Buffy&#x27;s, to socialize and to go to class. He offers her a job working as an outreach counselor at the school, and she gladly accepts.

Spike huddles in the school basement and tells an apparition of Warren Mears that he has prepared a speech to give Buffy, but she will not understand what he has to say. As Warren paces around Spike, he morphs successively into Glory, Adam, Mayor Wilkins, Drusilla and the Master - the previous villains of the series in reverse order. They all speak to Spike about a plan &quot;to go back to the beginning,&quot; and finally, the Master morphs into Buffy, telling Spike that it is not about right or wrong: it is about power.

Meanwhile, Willow is studying with Giles in Westbury, England. She studies magic and meditation with a coven of Wiccans that Giles knows. She is learning control, but feels frightened and distraught because she &quot;killed people&quot; and nearly destroyed the world with her dark magic. Later, she has a terrible vision of &quot;the Earth&#x27;s teeth&quot; — the Hellmouth. She tells Giles, who has taught her that everything is connected, but not every connection is good.

==Continuity==
* As Buffy accompanies Dawn to her high school, she warns her to stay away from &quot;hyena people, lizardy-type athletes and invisible people&quot; referencing the monsters Buffy encountered throughout her high school in season 1 and 2.
* Willow says that her helpers in the coven look at her as though &quot;I&#x27;m gonna turn them all into bangers and mash, or something.&quot; Bangers and mash is a traditional English dish, consisting of sausages (bangers) and mashed potatoes.
* As Buffy, Dawn and her friends are exiting the basement, Buffy comments that the school seems &#x27;a bit smaller,&#x27; which is the same comment Willow and Xander make as they walk through the charred remains in season 4.
* Halfrek says, &quot;Do I have to mention Mrs. Czolgosz?&quot; A writer at the BuffyGuide.com site says, &quot;Czolgosz... President William McKinley at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition in September 1901. In 1900, Czolgosz, then 23, married Emma Wisemki, a 17-year-old German immigrant whom he had apparently gotten pregnant... Stephen Sondheim, of whom Joss Whedon is a big fan, wrote about this event in &quot;The Ballad of Czolgosz&quot; in his musical &quot;Assassins&quot;.
* Spike&#x27;s in the basement of the newly refurbished Sunnydale High, The First appears before him as a host of former villains: Warren, Glory, Adam, the Mayor, Drusilla and Buffy&#x27;s first big bad, the Master, and since it is able to appear as those who have died, its last manifestation is as Buffy herself.
* This is the only time that Spike and the Master appear together, though the Master is only a manifestation of the First, and Spike and the Master never actually met onscreen. Spike and Mayor Wilkins have not met onscreen, either.
* In season 6&#x27;s DVD extras, the cast appeared on Academy of TV Arts and Sciences Panel Discussion. Here Michelle Trachtenberg said that she&#x27;d been begging Whedon to let her character wear black, seeing as she&#x27;d never been allowed to in order to keep her looking youthful and innocent. Dawn is seen wearing almost all black here on her first day of school.
* Buffy gives Dawn, Kit, and Carlos advice after rescuing them from the basement: &quot;School is intense, but you&#x27;ll do all right as long as you&#x27;re careful. And you might want to think about sticking together.&quot; Kit and Carlos do not, however, appear in later episodes, although Dawn is on the phone with Kit when the First begins causing chaos at the Summers house.

===Arc significance===

* The First comments, in the guise of Buffy, that everything is about &#x27;Power&#x27; (which is the theme of season seven). This is a conclusion that Buffy herself comes to twice: once while facing Glory and then again in the series finale.
* The First makes its first appearance since season 3, where it was seen tormenting the first vampire with a soul, Angel.
* The First was able to come back to attempt the annihilation of the Slayer line through Buffy&#x27;s resurrection, which was carried out at the beginning of the 6th season by Willow, Xander, Anya, and Tara.
* While in the basement Spike talks to the First saying &quot;I had a speech I learned it all.&quot; Spike professes this speech to Buffy in the next episode.

==Pop culture allusions==
* Willow says to Giles that &quot;you go all Dumbledore on me.&quot;
* Dawn says, &quot;Check out double-O Xander,&quot; referring to James Bond, code name 007.
* When Xander teasingly asks Buffy how you &quot;make&quot; cereal, she says, &quot;I saw it on The Food Channel.&quot;
* As Dawn leaves Buffy in the High School, she references &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;To Serve Man&quot;: &quot;I know: You never know what&#x27;s coming. The stake is not the power. &quot;To Serve Man&quot; is a cookbook. I love you. Go away.&quot;
* Dawn tells her teacher and class, &quot;I&#x27;m very into Britney Spears&#x27; early work.&quot;
* Principal Wood says, &quot;Curiouser and curiouser.&quot; This is a reference to the 1865 Lewis Carroll book Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland; Chapter Two begins with Alice exclaiming, &quot;Curiouser and curiouser!&quot;

<text>Puli Township () is an urban township in Nantou County, Taiwan. The township is located within the Puli Basin. It is the geographic center of Taiwan.

==Name==
In the 19th century the city was known as Posia () or Po-li-sia (). The Atayal name of the settlement was Sabaha Bakalas, meaning &quot;house of stars&quot;. From 1920, during the Japanese era, the town was administered as , , Taichū Prefecture.

==History==

===Spread of Christianity===
In 1870, a native of Po-li-sia named Khai-san received treatment for a medical issue in a missionary hospital in Taiwan-fu (present-day Tainan) and learned about Christianity. When he returned home, he spread information about Christianity to the people of the area. In July 1871, two native preachers were sent to the area after reports concerning the spread of Christianity in Po-li-sia were heard of in Taiwan-fu. They reported back that &quot;a movement, favourable to Christianity, had really taken place&quot; in the area. Members of the Canada Presbyterian Mission visited the area in March 1872. In late 1872, William Campbell was part of an armed party that traversed the jungle, mountains and streams between Toa-sia and Po-li-sia to participate in examining candidates for baptism who lived in Po-li-sia.

===Chi Chi earthquake===
In 1999, this town was damaged by the 921 earthquake. The damage was especially severe in Taomi Village, a small rural village located within Puli Township. 10 years later, the village has since re-invented itself to be the pride of Taiwan&#x27;s eco-tourism industry. Especially after the opening of the Paper Dome, now a major attraction in Puli Township, Taomi Village was transformed from a sleepy agricultural village to one that is busting with activities related to community redevelopment and eco-tourism. Since then, Taomi Village has seen vibrancy unprecedented since its glory days in the 1970s as an agricultural hub.

<text>ATB Financial is a financial institution and Crown corporation wholly owned by the province of Alberta, the only province in Canada with such a financial institution under its exclusive ownership.

Originally established as Alberta Treasury Branches in 1938, ATB Financial operates only in Alberta and provides financial services to over 800,000 Albertan residents and businesses. It is the largest public bank in North America and Alberta’s largest financial institution based in the province. Headquartered in Edmonton, ATB Financial has over 5000 employees.

ATB is not a chartered bank, meaning it is not regulated by the Canadian federal government under the &quot;Bank Act&quot; and associated regulations. ATB is instead regulated entirely by the Government of Alberta under the authority of the &quot;ATB Financial Act&quot; and associated regulations;&lt;ref name=&quot;O.C. 241/2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation is modeled on the statutes, regulations, and guidelines which govern banks and other federally chartered financial institutions. ATB is not a member of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or Alberta&#x27;s provincial Credit Union Deposit Guarantee Corporation; deposits are instead fully guaranteed by the Government of Alberta itself. ATB Financial was one of fifteen financial institutions that participated in Canada&#x27;s Large Value Transfer System.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The Alberta Treasury Branches were created by the Social Credit government of Premier William Aberhart in 1938, with its roots dating back to political unrest in 1917 arising from the unmet credit demands of the West. Prior to ATB Financial&#x27;s formation, Aberhart and Social Credit swept into power in the 1935 Alberta election in a wave of unrest following scandals surrounding the United Farmers Premier John Edward Brownlee. Aberhart&#x27;s government sought radical monetary reform in a province which was devastated by the Great Depression, as well as greater economic autonomy from both the federal government and financial institutions based largely in Toronto and Montréal.

However, in two years Aberhart&#x27;s government failed to bring forward promised reforms, which resulted in a backbencher revolt forcing the government to pass three pieces of controversial financial reform acts. &quot;Credit of Alberta Regulation Act&quot; required all bankers to obtain a licence from the Social Credit Commission, &quot;Bank Employees Civil Rights Act&quot; prevented unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating civil actions, and &quot;Judicature Act Amendment Act&quot; prevented any person from challenging the constitutionality of Alberta&#x27;s laws in court without receiving the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. In August 1937, the federal government disallowed all three acts. The Supreme Court of Canada, in answering reference questions posed by the federal government, unanimously ruled that such disallowance was valid.

Aberhart returned with three new bills, &quot;Bank Taxation Act&quot; (Bill 1) levying provincial taxes on banks&#x27; paid-up capital and reserve funds at punitive rates, &quot;Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, 1937&quot; (Bill 8) similar to the previous disallowed act, but covering all &quot;credit institutions&quot;, and &quot;Accurate News and Information Act&quot; (Bill 9) requiring newspapers to print &quot;clarifications&quot; of stories considered inaccurate by the Social Credit Board, and to reveal their sources on demand, and also authorizing the provincial government to prohibit the publication of any newspaper, any article by a given writer, or any article making use of a given source. All three bills were reserved by Lieutenant Governor John C. Bowen, and the federal government posed the reference questions to the Supreme Court. In &quot;Reference Re Alberta Statutes&quot; the Supreme Court ruled all three bills as &quot;ultra vires&quot;.

=== Formation ===

Aberhart sought to create a State Credit House which facilitated some banking services in small communities where larger banks had previously closed. Subsequently, the Aberhart government created the Alberta Treasury Branches through a series of Orders in Council in late-August and early-September 1938, following the judicial defeat of the Social Credit monetary reforms at the Supreme Court. The Aberhart government authorized the Treasury Department to establish &quot;branches of the provincial treasury&quot; and with $200,000 of provincial funds as capital the first Alberta Treasury Branch was opened in Rocky Mountain House on September 29, 1938, followed by branches in Edmonton, Andrew, Grande Prairie, Killam, and St. Paul which opened the next day. The first employees of the Treasury Branches were provincial civil servants with previous banking experience, many of whom were transferred from the Treasury Department&#x27;s Sales Tax Branch following the abolishment of the provincial sales tax. Besides banking, the Treasury Branches served as government offices and propaganda centres.

The Aberhart government was able to utilize the Treasury Branches to operate the &quot;Interim Program&quot;, which was an attempt to provide the citizen&#x27;s dividend promised by the Social Credit government in 1935. The Interim Program&#x27;s name indicated the temporary nature of the program, which would remain in place until a complete system of Social Credit could be established in Alberta. Under the interim program, the Treasury Branches issued non-negotiable transfer vouchers in place of regular currency that could be redeemed at participating merchants in the province. Consumers who purchased goods from participating merchants that were partially produced in Alberta would earn a &quot;bonus&quot; in their account of up to three per cent, the full bonus (in the form of transfer vouchers) being earned if one-third of a consumers aggregate monthly purchases were &quot;Alberta-made&quot;. The one-third Alberta-made program was generally ineffective in increasing domestic market demand as it was easy for consumers to meet the low threshold over the period of one month. In response, the threshold on Alberta-made products was raised to one-half in February 1941.

Transfer vouchers could also be used for payments to the provincial government, including taxes, licence fees, and other provincial debts. The transfer voucher system worked considerably better than the previous attempt to issue a citizen&#x27;s dividend in the form of prosperity certificates in 1936.

The Treasury Branches proved popular amongst Albertans, resulting in the government establishing 22 branches and 270 branch agencies by June 1939. The Treasury Branches were first authorized to provide loans in 1941 to be approved under a centralized &quot;loan committee&quot; overseen by the Treasury Branches Superintendent. Expanding into lending services was necessary to gain a stronger presence in retail areas, as many merchants who operate with the Treasury Branches also maintained a separate account at another bank to ensure access to credit.

The only services provided up to 1943 were term savings accounts at 1.5 to 3 per cent interest, and the sale of automobile, hunting and fishing licences. Furthermore, the government charged consumers a two per cent penalty on cash withdrawals to continue to incentivize Albertans to use non-negotiable transfer vouchers to ensure capital did not flow out of the branches. Merchants were provided a means to withdraw a certain amount of cash without being charged a penalty in order to replace goods sold for vouchers. A formula was developed to determine the &quot;basic rate&quot;, the amount of cash the merchant could withdraw without penalty by taking the merchant&#x27;s annual profit margin as a percentage and subtracting it from 100 per cent (i.e. 10% margin less 100% means 90% of the balance is available to be withdrawn without penalty). The calculation basic rate system was deemed cumbersome and replaced in February 1941 with a centralized list compiled by the Department of Industries and Labour, based on the type of products and services sold and the location of the business. By early 1942 there were over 7,125 merchants enrolled under the interim program.

Government employees were partially paid with Treasury Branch vouchers, with single employees, widows and widowers receiving 15 per cent of their salary in voucher form. Married employees were paid between 15 and 25 per cent of their salary in vouchers, and the calculation was made after all deductions. This policy encouraged employees to use the service instead of other banks. The bonus system ceased in April 1945 and a contingency of $480,738 was paid out of the province&#x27;s general revenue fund to a reserve fund for the purpose of covering the cumulative earned bonuses during the program.

The Treasury Branches proved to be successful as deposits grew to $24-million by 1946, and by 1950 there were 45 Treasury Branches, six sub-branches, and 110 agencies employing 331 staff.

===Changes in 1950s and 1960s===

During the 1955 Alberta election the Treasury Branches came under scrutiny for allegations of preferential treatment for loans to members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), as well as preferential contracts awarded to firms indebted to the provincial government. The Treasury Branches provided significant loans to a handful of road construction companies, with the firm Sparling-Davis provided $4.5-million in loans, which was more than 20 per cent of the Treasury Branches overall loans. Premier Ernest Manning reluctantly approved a Royal Commission to look into the lending practices of the Treasury Branches the day before the 1955 election, the commission was led by Hugh John Macdonald and James Mahaffy. The commission was provided with narrow terms of reference and found there was no evidence of maladministration or wrongdoing by the government or the Treasury Branches. Prior to the formation of the commission the government responded to the allegations by introducing a bill in 1955 which prevented MLAs from borrowing from the Treasury Branches.

The 1967 Royal Commission on Banking and Finance led by Justice Dana Porter recommended that a deposit insurance scheme be implemented for Canadian banks. Subsequently, in 1969 the 16th Alberta Legislature passed &quot;The Treasury Branch Deposits Guarantee Act&quot; which provided a provincial guarantee for the deposits of the Treasury Branches.

===Oil and gas boom and bust===

The Alberta economy grew significantly in the 1970s and early 1980s due to the rising price of oil. Total loans issued by the Treasury Branches grew from $10.6-million in 1950 to $1.9-billion by 1981.

However, despite significant growth, prosperity would not last forever. All Alberta industries suffered in the early 1980s owing to high interest rates, low world commodity prices, and the National Energy Program. The Treasury Branches were no exception, posting the first of six consecutive years of losses in 1983. Other regional financial institutions suffered at this time with the collapse of the Canadian Commercial Bank and the Northland Bank in 1985. By 1989 the Treasury Branches had an accumulated deficit of CA$150 million.

ATB was the subject of scandal in the late 1980s after clients such as Peter Pocklington&#x27;s Gainers Foods and the Ghermezian Brothers&#x27; West Edmonton Mall defaulted on loans.

The Treasury Branches did begin to innovate in the early 1980s as well, joining the Canadian Payments Association in 1983 allowed the institution to clear cheques, and the Branches developed an interest rate shielding policy for agricultural customers and delivered special payments on behalf of the government&#x27;s residential mortgage loan program. In 1984 the Treasury Branches offered US dollar savings accounts in partnership with Citibank. Automated teller machines were introduced in 1989 and in 1990 the Treasury Branches became the first Canadian financial institution to offer telephone banking services.

=== 1990s===

In the 1990s, the government reformed Alberta Treasury Branches with the intention of transforming it into a financial institution that could compete with Canadian chartered banks. Public trust was eroded during the 1980s and 1990s as high-risk loans with political motivations eroded the Treasury Branches financial footing, including a $100-million loss in 1996.

By 1994, there were 142 Treasury Branches, 125 agencies, 3,000 staff and 80 automated teller machines in Alberta. The Klein government appointed Gordon Flynn to review the Treasury Branches operations, Flynn recommended a number of changes including greater autonomy, financial accountability measures and the appointment of a Board of Directors. Flynn&#x27;s recommendations were reviewed by a working group chaired by former federal finance minister Don Mazankowski, which provided nine further recommendations for the operations of ATB. Mazankowski recommended the government articulate the public policy goals and benchmarks for the institution, ATB must operate at an arms-length from the government, operate under a board of directors, be provided equal treatment against other private sector banks, modernized to allow ATB to compete with modern banks, offer new and in demand financial services and products, deliver programs with a for profit emphasis, remain cost conscious and profit motivated, and be subject to an accountability regime similar to the private sector.

Provincial Treasurer Jim Dinning quickly introduced legislation to create an independent board of directors made up of government appointees was established in 1996 and ATB formally became an autonomous provincial Crown corporation on October 8, 1997. The government also appointed former Metropolitan Life CEO Paul Haggis as the new superintendent of ATB in 1996.

=== 2000s to present ===

The Alberta Treasury Branches rebranded in January 2002 as &quot;ATB Financial&quot; in an effort to gain stronger brand recognition in urban areas such as Calgary and Edmonton. By 2002 ATB Financial controlled 15 per cent of the province&#x27;s retail banking, but lagged in the cities with seven per cent in Calgary and eight per cent in Edmonton. The official change of name for the crown corporation did not occur until 2017.

ATB was not immune to the 2008 financial crisis, when over $1.2-billion of non-bank sponsored asset-backed commercial paper became illiquid. The financial crisis resulted in special provisions for credit loss of $253-million and $225-million in 2008 and 2009. Alberta&#x27;s Auditor-General noted that inappropriate incentives may have been to blame for insufficient due diligence on for the losing securities. The Progressive Conservative government responded in July 2009 when Finance Minister Iris Evans announced a number of government programs to strengthen ATB&#x27;s balance sheet including providing $600-million in notational capital, and changes to requirements for capital adequacy test.

In 2015, the New Democratic government capitalized ATB Financial with an additional $1.5-billion to promote lending access to small and medium-sized businesses. In 2021 &quot;Fast Company&quot; named ATB Financial one its 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators in the International category. Based in Calgary, it had a three-year-old incubator, ATB Ventures.

==Controversies==
===West Edmonton Mall scandal ===

In 1998 ATB filed a lawsuit against the former acting superintendent of the bank and the Ghermezian family alleging the family bribed the official to issue a commercially unreasonable loan guarantee for West Edmonton Mall. The $65-million, 30-year loan in question was issued at no interest, and fully guaranteed a $353.5-million loan provided by Toronto Dominion Bank, both occurring on October 31, 1994. The loan agreement also provided unusual concessions such as allowing dividends to continue to be paid, prevents ATB from initiating foreclosure proceedings for 20 years and included a lease that allowed the Ghermezian family the right to manage the mall for 99 years. The former superintendent claimed the financing occurred on the orders of Premier Ralph Klein and other provincial politicians, although a probe by the auditor general found no evidence of government direction. The lawsuit was settled in December 2002, with details of the settlement remaining private.

===Privatization===

Throughout its history ATB Financial has remained a prominent candidate for proponents of privatization in Alberta. Under Premier Ralph Klein the Government of Alberta moved to privatize government corporations and services. The Klein mantra of &quot;getting government out of the business of business&quot; applied to several government owned businesses that competed against similar private companies. ATB as a financial institution competed against chartered banks and credit unions, making it prime target for privatization. The government review led by Gordon Flynn recommended privatization; however, support from the Progressive Conservative rural caucus, and the ongoing and high-profile West Edmonton Mall lawsuit in the late 1990s created significant uncertainty for the value of ATB, scuttling any plans for privatization.

In its 2018 report, the Parkland Institute argued against privatization of ATB Financial noting the policy implications available to the Government of Alberta through a fully government controlled financial institution. The Parkland Institute argued ATB could be used to provide low cost financing to Albertans, financing social housing, financing climate change goals, purchasing government debt and providing for agricultural growth. The Parkland Institute further argues against privatization due to the vast network of rural and remote branches ATB operates, which would not be financially viable for a traditional bank without a similar mandate.

In March 2019, Finance Minister Joe Ceci revealed the Government of Alberta had received a detailed offer from Scotiabank to purchase ATB Financial; however, the amount offered to privatize ATB was not provided by Ceci.

== Financials ==
As of May 24, 2018, ATB reported assets of $51.9 billion, deposits of $32.7 billion, loans of $44.1 billion, and a net income of $274.6 million.

<text>James Edward Narz (February 26, 1927 – October 7, 2020), known professionally as Tom Kennedy, was an American television host best known for his work in game shows. Game shows Kennedy hosted included &quot;Password Plus&quot;, &quot;Split Second&quot;, &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot;

== Early years ==
Born in Louisville, Kentucky, James Edward Narz was the son of John Lawrence Narz Sr., and the younger brother of host Jack Narz (1922–2008), whose son, David, related about his uncle&#x27;s name change that the brothers wanted to avoid the perceived conflict of having two announcers with the same last name promoting competing products. &quot;After a lunch meeting with his agent,&quot; he said, &quot;... he emerged as Tom Kennedy.&quot;

Kennedy attended the University of Missouri and the University of Kentucky.

Kennedy did TV commercial spots for Regal Beer on &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; (later Jubilee USA), an ABC series which ran from 1955 to 1960. He introduced himself as Jim Narz in the commercials.

== Radio ==
While attending the University of Missouri, Kennedy worked at KFRU in Columbia, Missouri. While in Lexington, Kentucky, he worked at WKLX. After moving to Los Angeles, he worked for five years at KPOL and had a part-time job at KGIL.

== Shows ==
Kennedy&#x27;s biggest hit series were &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot; which aired on NBC from 1963 to 1969, and on ABC in 1975; &quot;Split Second&quot; (1972–75); &quot;Name That Tune&quot; (1974–81); and &quot;Password Plus&quot;, which he hosted from 1980 to 1982 following the illness (and later death) of original host Allen Ludden.
His other hosting credits include &quot;The Big Game&quot; (1958), &quot;Dr. I.Q.&quot; (1958–59), &quot;It&#x27;s Your Bet&quot; (1971–72), &quot;Break the Bank&quot; (1976), &quot;50 Grand Slam&quot; (1976), &quot;To Say the Least&quot; (1977–78), &quot;Whew!&quot; (1979–80), &quot;Body Language&quot; (1984–86), a syndicated nighttime version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (1985–86) and &quot;Wordplay&quot; (1986–87). He briefly hosted a talk show, &quot;The Real Tom Kennedy Show&quot;, in the early 1970s, and appeared as a guest panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot; and other game shows.
As an actor, he made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot; and &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;.

== Retirement and death ==
Kennedy retired in 1989 after several game show pilots produced by his production company failed to sell. In 2003, he appeared on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; during &quot;Game Show Week Part 2&quot;.

After a period of ill health, Kennedy died at his home in Oxnard, California, on October 7, 2020, at the age of 93.

== Awards ==
In July 2005, Kennedy and his brother Jack Narz were co-recipients of the Game Show Congress&#x27;s Bill Cullen Award for Lifetime Achievement. Cullen was a brother-in-law of Narz and Kennedy.

<text>Dongshi District (; Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: Tûng-sṳ) is a suburban district in eastern Taichung, Republic of China (Taiwan). It is the third largest district by area in Taichung City after Heping District and Taiping District. A majority of the residents are Hakka, making it an enclave in an otherwise non-Hakka county. Its Hakka dialect is very distinct compared to the dialects of other counties.

Dongshi is situated on a narrow, north–south oriented plain, flanked by the Dajia River to the west and the Xueshan Range to the east. It is this sense of being pressed up against that ridge, at the easternmost edge of the large west-central plain, that gives the town its name. Its elevation ranges from about 330 meters along the Dajia River to 1201 meters in the foothills of the Central Mountain Range.

The township is bounded by (clockwise from the north) Zhuolan, Heping, Xinshe, Shigang, Fengyuan, Houli, and Sanyi.

==History==

After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Dongshi was organized as an urban township of Taichung County. On 25 December 2010, Taichung County was merged with Taichung City and Dongshi was upgraded to a district of the city. Buildings in Dongshi were severely damaged by the Chi-Chi earthquake in 1999.

== Administrative divisions ==
Dongshi is divided into 25 villages , which are Beixing, Zhongning, Tungan , Nanping, Yanping, Shangxin, Guangxing, Taichang, Zhongke, Fulong, Longxing, Xincheng, Yifu, Shangcheng, Xiacheng, Qingdong, Qingfu, Tungxin, Yuening, Xiaxin, Xinglong, Maoxing, Taixing, Beitou and Mingzheng.

== Famous features ==
Dongshi includes some greenspace and significant farmland; largely orchards. Dongshi is known for its pears, which are large and almost spherical with a thin, light yellowish-brown rugose skin. In a good year, their flavor is excellent. Intensive topwork at the start of each season involves grafting Japanese pear bud slips to the tree stock.
The old train station has been converted into the Dongshih Hakka Cultural Park. Historical Hakka cultural artefacts along with modern works of art are on display. This area also marks the eastern terminus of the Dongshih-Fongyuan Bicycle Greenway (東豐自行車綠廊.) This greenway was converted from a former railway track. The town is also noted for two large forest parks in the mountainous eastern parts of the county. Dongshi Forest Park (東勢林場) and Sijiaolin (四角林林場) are managed by the Changhua County and Taichung City Agricultural Committees respectively.

== Native products ==
* Persimmon
* Pear

== Tourist attractions ==
* Dongshi Forestry Culture Park
* Fuxing Suspension Bridge
* Shihgang Dam
* Dongshi Forest Garden
* Dongshi Hakka Cultural Park

==Transportation==
Dongshi is served by Provincial Highway 8, known as the Central Cross-Island Highway, Provincial Highway 3, and Taichung Special Route 1, which leads to the Daxueshan National Forest Recreation Area.

== Notable natives ==
* Chan Hao-ching, tennis athlete
* Latisha Chan, tennis athlete
* Shyu Jong-shyong, Deputy Secretary-General of Executive Yuan (2015–2016)

<doc id="951069" wikidata="Q3502380" url="?curid=951069" title="USS Ralph Talbot">
<text>USS &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; (DD-390) was a &quot;Bagley&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy, named for USMC Second Lieutenant Ralph Talbot (1897–1918), who was awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I. &quot;Talbot&quot; served in the Pacific Theater during World War II, from the attack on Pearl Harbor through the battle of Okinawa, earning 14 battle stars for her service.

==Launching and pre-war operations==
&quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard 28 October 1935; launched 31 October 1936; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Talbot, mother of Lieutenant Talbot; and commissioned 14 October 1937. On 21 September 1938 during the New England Hurricane, the frigate rammed into the &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; after breaking loose.

Prior to the U.S. entry into World War II, &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot;, assigned to Destroyers, Battle Force, operated in the eastern Pacific. In early 1941, she began a major overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California and in April 1941, she rejoined the fleet at San Diego. At midmonth, she steamed to Pearl Harbor whence she operated for the remainder of the year.

==The war begins==
Moored at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941, the crew of the &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; manned her guns and began preparations for getting underway within minutes of the start of the Japanese attack. By 0900 she was en route out of the harbor having already splashed her first enemy aircraft. After the attack, she searched for enemy submarines and, on the 14th, sortied with Task Force 14 (TF 14) on the first of a series of carrier force screening assignments.

==Sailing for the South Pacific==
In January 1942, she sailed with Task Force 8 during raids against Japanese positions in the Marshalls and Gilberts and in February and March against Wake and Marcus Islands.

Returning to Pearl Harbor with Task Force 16 on 9 March 1942, &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; joined Task Force 15 on the 19th and through May escorted convoys between Hawaii and the west coast. In early June, she escorted auxiliaries to the northwest of Hawaii; which refueled and replenished the victors of the Battle of Midway, then escorted TF 16 back to Pearl Harbor. On the 14th she got underway for Australia and New Zealand, and then sailed on 22 July for the Solomons and the first of the island assaults which would eventually lead to victory in the Pacific.

==The Battle of Savo Island==
Assigned to Task Group 62.6 (TG 62.6), she screened the transport group to Guadalcanal, arriving on the morning of 7 August, then patrolled off the transport area through the landings. On the 8th she took up patrol station north of Savo Island and at 0145 on the 9th received word of three enemy ships inside Savo Island. Soon afterward heavy gunfire was seen to the southeast, the first Battle of Savo Island had begun and Ironbottom Sound was on its way to being named.

Half an hour later &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; was shelled by a friendly destroyer, 

the error was quickly rectified, but within minutes an enemy cruiser appeared off her port quarter. Both ships opened fire and searchlight switches were flicked on. &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot;&#x27;s searchlight cables had been severed in the earlier shelling, but the enemy&#x27;s worked. The spotlighted DD 390 took a hit in the chart house which destroyed radar equipment, cut fire control circuits, and ignited fires. Three more shells came in close succession, hitting the wardroom, the starboard quarter, and the underside of gun Number 4. Among the twelve dead were the Doctor and the Chief Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate.

At 0221 &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; ceased firing. The enemy had disappeared, but the damage she had caused required a new fight. Fire enveloped the bridge and the ship listed heavily to starboard. Slowing to one-third speed, she turned toward Savo. At 0230 all radio communication to and from the vessel ceased, but twenty minutes later she stood in close to the shore where the crew continued the battle to save her. By 0330 fires and flooding were under control and repair work was begun. Soon after 0700 communications were reestablished and by 1210 repairs, including mattress patches on the hull, were sufficient to begin the journey back to the United States for repairs.

==Back in service==
Arriving at Mare Island 11 September 1942, &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; headed west again on 11 November after being repaired. Refresher exercises kept her in Hawaii until mid-December and on the 16th she got underway for Australia.

She arrived at Brisbane on 2 January 1943 and until 10 May conducted training exercises and escorted convoys along the northern and eastern coasts of that continent. On 13 May she arrived at Noumea to provide similar service as Allied forces pushed up the Solomons.

On 30 June she covered the landings on Rendova to commence the New Georgia campaign, rescuing 300 survivors from the &quot;McCawley&quot; (APA-4) within hours of the completion of the landings. On 5 July she landed 148th Infantry units at Rice Anchorage after softening the landing area with her 5-inch guns. On the 9th and 11th, she participated in the bombardments of Munda and on the night of 12 July joined TG 36.1 in a sweep up the Slot. The Allied ships engaged an enemy cruiser and five destroyers escorting destroyer transports in the Battle of Kolombangara. After that battle, salvage operations on &quot;Gwin&quot; (DD-433) were frustrated by enemy aerial attacks. &quot;Ralph Talbot&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes sent the damaged destroyer to the bottom.

Through August and September and into October, &quot;Talbot&quot; continued to carry out patrol and escort duties in the Solomons. On 27 October 1943, she sailed again for Australia, then continued on to Milne Bay, arriving 3 November, where antisubmarine and antiaircraft patrol and escort missions continued. At midmonth she returned briefly to Tulagi, then resumed operations off New Guinea. On the night of 29 November, she participated in a Task Force 74 bombardment of Japanese positions on New Britain. In mid-December, she covered the landings at Kiriwina as the Allies secured the Trobriands, then, toward the end of the month returned to New Britain to cover the assault on Cape Gloucester. Through the end of the year, she divided her patrol time between Buna, on the New Guinea mainland, and Cape Gloucester.

==Beginning the New Year==
On 1 January 1944 she got underway with Task Force 76 for the preinvasion bombardment of, and landings at, Saidor. She next escorted reinforcements to both Saidor and Cape Gloucester. In early February she returned to Milne Bay, then steamed east to the United States for overhaul.

In mid-May she departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor and a month later sailed for Eniwetok and Saipan as convoy escort. Arriving at Garapan Harbor 5 July, she provided gunfire support to troops ashore, evacuated stranded casualties and on the 7th returned to escort duty in the Marshalls and Marianas. Back at Saipan on the 25th, she provided fire support and harassing shore bombardment fire at Tinian on the 27th, then resumed escort duties. Continuing that duty into August, she joined TF 38.4 at Eniwetok and on the 28th sailed for strikes against the Volcano and Bonin Islands (31 August – 2 September) Yap (7–8 September), and the Palaus (10–19 September).

Following the Palau offensive, the force retired to Manus; then returned to the Palaus, where, in October 1944, they sailed to strike against Japanese shipping and positions on Okinawa, Luzon, and Formosa. On the 14th the force returned to smash targets on Luzon, continuing the raids through the 19th. On the 20th it supported the Leyte landings, then returned to operations off Luzon. On the 24th it steamed north to intercept the Japanese Northern Carrier Force. On the 25th, as &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; screened the heavier vessels, the Battle off Cape Engaño was fought and, on the 31st, the force retired to Ulithi.

&quot;Ralph Talbot&quot;, detached from the fast carriers on 16 November, rejoined the 7th Fleet on the 17th and, with the CVEs of TG 77.4, patrolled the convoy routes in the Leyte Gulf area until the 27th when she steamed to Kossol Roads. On 12 December she returned to Leyte Gulf, then escorted the CVEs into the Sulu Sea for operations in support of the Mindoro landings. A brief respite at Manus followed, preceding her next screening assignment, the Luzon invasion.

Departing the Admiralties 27 December, the destroyer steamed north to Kossol Roads and on 1 January 1945 sortied with the escort carrier group. On the 4th, the &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;(CVE-79) was hit by a kamikaze and on the 6th the group arrived off Lingayen Gulf. Through the 17th, the destroyer screened the carriers as they provided air cover for the assault troops and on the 23d she returned to Ulithi to replenish. Reassigned to the 5th Fleet in February, she steamed to Saipan, where she screened transports to Iwo Jima. Between the 16th and the 27th, she patrolled off that island, then returned to Saipan.

Back at Ulithi 5 March, she remained at that base until 20 April when she got underway for Okinawa. Arriving at Hagushi on the 26th, she immediately reported for duty in TG 51.5 and commenced antiaircraft patrols. Soon after 2200, on the 27th, while patrolling off the anchorage, she was closed by two enemy fighters flown by pilots of the &quot;Divine Wind&quot; school. The first crashed into the starboard side aft. The second, a near miss, splashed into the sea off the port quarter. Damage control parties brought flooding under control by 2213 and within minutes &quot;PCE-852&quot; pulled alongside, with a medical officer and seven corpsmen. Her casualties were five dead and nine wounded. The destroyer then turned back to Kerama Retto for repairs. On 20 May she got underway to return to the Hagushi anchorage where she again joined the antiaircraft screen. On the 26th she shifted to Nakagusuku Wan, then back to Kerama Retto where she rejoined the escort carriers. A month later she steamed to Leyte, then to Saipan. There she resumed convoy escort duty, and for the remainder of World War II plied between the Marianas and the Ryukyus.

In August, she was busy in the Philippine Sea conducting rescue operations after USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was sunk in that area. She rescued 24 survivors and four days later returned to Ulithi Atoll to continue her service.

On 1 September 1945, &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; escorted the USS &quot;Portland&quot;, sister ship of the &quot;Indianapolis&quot; and the lead of its class, from Guam to Truk and on the 2nd stood by as the Japanese formally surrendered that island fortress during ceremonies aboard the cruiser. Returning to Guam on the 3rd, the destroyer sailed for Saipan, Okinawa, and Japan on the 5th and, into October, operated off southern Japan and Okinawa, getting underway for the United States on 29 October.

Contaminated with nuclear fallout during the tests, the destroyer was towed to Kwajalein where she was decommissioned 29 August 1946 and sunk, in deep water off the atoll, 8 March 1948. Her name was struck from the Navy list 5 April 1948.

==Cultural references==
During the opening historical sequence of the HBO mini-series &quot;The Pacific&quot;, the USS &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; is shown sailing through rough seas, apparently performing escort duty, based on the ships in the background. On the ship, sailors are seen on deck around the Number 1 and Number 2 gun mounts, manning the AA mounts below the Bridge, and on the starboard bridge wing. The ship&#x27;s hull number is in war-time, low visibility reduced-size. In the program World War II in Colour, Episode 5, Red Sun Rampant, The Talbot is shown at the 35:36 minute point of the program.  In Ken Burns “The War” the Talbot appears at 1:36:59 of disc 1. The appearance context is the embarkation of troops for the North Africa invasion, an apparent error since the Talbot served exclusively in the Pacific theater of operation. In the famed N.B.C. 1952 documentary &quot;Victory At Sea&quot; episode titled &quot;Target Suribachi&quot; the Talbot can again be seen in very heavy seas. This could be the same footage as that viewed in the miniseries &quot;The Pacific&quot;.

<doc id="951080" wikidata="Q3349675" url="?curid=951080" title="Music of Bengal">
<text>Bengali music () comprises a long tradition of religious and secular song-writing over a period of almost a millennium. Composed with lyrics in the Bengali language, Bengali music spans a wide variety of styles.

== History ==
The earliest music in Bengal was influenced by Sanskrit chants, and evolved under the influence of Vaishnav poetry such as the 13th-century &quot;Gitagovindam&quot; by Jayadeva, whose work continues to be sung in many eastern Hindu temples. The Middle Ages saw a mixture of Hindu and Islamic trends when the musical tradition was formalized under the patronage of Sultan and Nawabs and the powerful landlords &quot;baro bhuiyans&quot;.

The earliest record of Sufism in Bengal goes back to 11th century AD in connection with the continuation of Sufism in northern India. Shah Sultan Rumi was the first Sufi to come to Bengal, when he came to Mymensingh in 1053 AD.Sufism not only helped in the spread of Islam in Bengal, but also contributed to the eventual creation of a Muslim society in Bangladesh. Apart from the religiosity, the influence of the Sufis became attached to popular Bengali culture by the confluence of the murshidi, marfati and baul songs, and gazir gan. 

==Forms==

=== Kotali Gharana ===
Kotalipara in the Faridpur Zilla of East Bengal (presently Bangladesh) owes its origin to “Chandraburmankot” erected there, circa 315 AD, the remains of which are still extant. “Kot” stands for fort, “Ali” signifies “wall and area surrounding the fort”, and “para” means a settlement or “a neighbourhood”. 

KotaliPara had been a hotbed of intellectual excellence for ages, especially in music, art and scholarship. 

Sangeetacharya Tarapada Chakraborty (1909-1975), was the first Pan-Indian Khayaliya from Bengal and the pioneer of Kotali Gharana. He had a journey similar to Ustad Allauddin Khan’s, coming to Kolkata penniless from Kotalipara ( currently in Bangladesh ) to learn classical music. Kotali Gharana is built on aesthetics. The aesthetics of the raga, expression, lyrics and thoughts. Over the years, the present Kotali style took the shape in the hands of Pandit Manas Chakraborty, a combination of musical purity and eclecticism, the practice of deriving ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources. Vidushi Ruchira Panda, is the global face of Kotali Gharana today.

=== Bishnupur Gharana ===
The Bishnupur Gharana is the sole Classical (Drupad) gharana of Bengal. It originated in Bishnupur, Bankura by the court musicians of the Malla Kings. Bahadur Khan of Delhi, a descendant of the Tansen, was the father of Bishnupur Gharana. Bahadur Khan was brought to Bishnupur by Malla King Raghunath Singha II.

===Murshidi===

Murshidi Gan devotional folk songs that evolved and flourished mainly through sufis. The word &#x27;murshid&#x27;, derives from the Arabic &#x27;ershad&#x27;, and means &#x27;to order or give advice&#x27;. A murshid gives advice to his disciples and leads them to the spiritual way by means of devotional rites.

===Baul===
The Bauls (meaning &quot;divinely inspired insanity&quot;) are a group of mystic minstrels (Muslim Sufis and Hindu Baishnos) from the Bengal region, who sang primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are thought to have been influenced greatly by the Hindu tantric sect of the Kartabhajas as well as by Muslim Sufi philosophers. Bauls traveled and sang in search of the internal ideal, &quot;Moner Manush&quot; (&quot;Man of the Heart&quot; or the &quot;inner being&quot;), and described &quot;superfluous&quot; differences between religions. Lalon Fakir, alternatively known as Lalon Shah, who lived in the 19th century in and around Kushtia, is considered to be the greatest of all bauls.

===Ramprasadi===

The Bengali devotional songs written and music composed by eighteenth century Bengali saint-poet Ramprasad Sen are called Ramprasadi. They are usually addressed to Hindu goddess Kali.

===Lalon Geeti===

The Bengali songs composed by Bengali saint, philosopher, and social reformer Lalon are called Lalon Geeti. Lalon was against religious conflict and many of his songs mock identity politics that divide communities and generate violence. He even rejected nationalism at the apex of the anti-colonial nationalist movements in the Indian subcontinent. He did not believe in classes or castes, the fragmented, hierarchical society and took a stand against racism. Lalon does not fit the &quot;mystical&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; type who denies all worldly affairs in search of the soul: he embodies the socially transformative role of sub-continental bhakti and sufism. He believed in the power of music to alter the intellectual and emotional state in order to be able to understand and appreciate life itself.

It is estimated that Lalon composed about 2,000–10,000 songs, of which only about 800 songs are generally considered authentic. Lalon left no written copies of his songs, which were transmitted orally and only later transcribed by his followers. Lalon left no written copies of his songs, which were transmitted orally and only later transcribed by his followers. Rabindranath Tagore published some of the Lalon song in the monthly &quot;Prabasi&quot; magazine of Kolkata.

=== Hasan Raja &quot;s Songs ===
This songs are composed by legendary Bengali mystic poet, songwriter, and philosopher , Hason Raja, from Sylhet, Bangladesh. His songs focus on spiritual awakening, the transient nature of life, and the search for divinity within oneself. These compositions, often referred to as &quot;Baul songs&quot;, are filled with mysticism, simplicity, and profound truth. Hasan Raja&#x27;s works have inspired countless folk singers and spiritual enthusiasts.

===Rabindra Sangeet===
The leading proponent of Bengali music is Rabindranath Tagore (known in Bengali as &quot;Robi Thakur&quot; and &quot;Gurudeb&quot;, the latter meaning &quot;Respected Teacher&quot; (in the Bengal of that time, the suffix &#x27;deb&#x27; was an honorific, ascribed to people who enjoyed immense respect, but this title was primarily used by his students at Santiniketan, though many others did use the address/) Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit. His songs are known as &quot;rabindrasangit&quot; (&quot;Tagore Song&quot;), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which—poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike—were lyricised. Influenced by the &quot;thumri&quot; style of Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions. They emulated the tonal colour of classical &quot;ragas&quot; to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga&#x27;s melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different &quot;ragas&quot;. Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not &quot;bhanga gaan&quot;, the body of tunes revamped with &quot;fresh value&quot; from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours &quot;external&quot; to Tagore&#x27;s own ancestral culture. His music is an exemplary instance of &#x27;kavya-geeti&#x27;, a style of composition that later found widespread use in the music industries at Bombay and Calcutta.

In 1971, &quot;Amar Shonar Bangla&quot; became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written — ironically — to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal along communal lines: cutting off the Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a cunning plan to stop the independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; was written in &quot;shadhu-bhasha&quot;, a Sanskritised form of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of the Brahmo hymn &quot;Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata&quot; that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.

For Bengalis, the songs&#x27; appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore&#x27;s poetry, was such that the &quot;Modern Review&quot; observed that &quot;[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath&#x27;s songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs&quot;. Tagore influenced &quot;sitar&quot; maestro Vilayat Khan and &quot;sarodiyas&quot; Buddhadev Dasgupta and Amjad Ali Khan.

Most of his musical poems are detailed in two series of books – the &quot;Gitabitan&quot; (that only has the texts of the poems) and the &quot;Swarabitan&quot; (that has the poems and their musical notation). However, there exist several poems of his that are set to music, and yet find no mention in either of the above. These are handed down from his students to their students and so on.

Some of the notable exponents of Rabindrasangeet are Shantideb Ghosh, Debabrata Biswas, Pankaj Kumar Mullick, Kalim Sharafi, Kanika Bandyopadhyay, Rajeshwari Datta, Malati Ghoshal, Nilima Sen, Suchitra Mitra, Aditi Mohsin, Rezwana Choudhury Bannya, Subinoy Roy, Chinmoy Chatterjee, Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Dwijen Mukhopadhyay, Sagar Sen, Santosh Thakur, Purabi Mukhopadhyay, Kabir Suman, Banani Ghosh, Mita Haque, Indrani Sen, Srikanto Acharya, Shreya Guhathakurta Sahana Bajpaie Mohan Singh

Furthermore, it is believed that on December 27, 1931, Dhurjatiprasad Mukhopadhyay wrote an essay titled “রবীন্দ্রনাথের সংগীত” (Rabindranath’s Music) for Tagore’s 70th birth anniversary, in which the term  “Rabindrasangeet” was used for the first time. In January 1935, Kanak Das’s recording  P11792, featuring “মনে রবে কিনা রবে আমারে” (“Whether or not I remain in your  recollection”) and “কাছে যবে ছিল পাশে হল না যাওয়া” (“When you were near, I couldn’t  reach you”) first used “Rabindrasangeet” on the label. 

===Nazrul Geeti===

<text>The Ikarus Aero 2 was a piston-engined military trainer aircraft built in Yugoslavia in the years following World War II, although the design pre-dated the war.

==Design and development==
The Ikarus Aero-2 was developed as a replacement for the Zmaj Fizir FN, which had been the most commonly used training aircraft of the Yugoslav Royal Air Force up until 1941. The Ikarus Aero-2 was designed by Boris Cijan and Đorđe Petković. Also at same time, was started project on two different aircraft, low-wing Ikarus MM-2 for advanced train and low-wing Rogožarski Brucoš for basic train. First flight test was made on April 20, 1940 and test pilot was Vasilije Stojanovic. 248 plane were eventually built, serving from 1948 to 1959 (380 built according to.

Powerplant was to be the de Havilland Gipsy Major because of its successful use in similar trainer aircraft built in other countries. The Aero 2 was a low-wing monoplane that seated the student and instructor in tandem, open cockpits (although later versions added a canopy to enclose them). Undercarriage was fixed and used a tailskid.

==Variants==

<text>Dacrydium is a genus of conifers belonging to the podocarp family Podocarpaceae. Sixteen species of evergreen dioecious trees and shrubs are presently recognized. The genus was first described by Solander in 1786, and formerly included many more species, which were divided into sections A, B, and C by Florin in 1931. The revisions of de Laubenfels and Quinn (see references), reclassified the former section A as the new genus &quot;Falcatifolium&quot;, divided Section C into new genera &quot;Lepidothamnus, Lagarostrobos&quot; and &quot;Halocarpus&quot;, and retained Section B as genus &quot;Dacrydium&quot;.

==Species==

==Distribution==
The natural range of &quot;Dacrydium&quot; extends from New Zealand, New Caledonia, Fiji and the Solomon Islands through Malesia (New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines), to Thailand and southern China.

<text>Spheres of Chaos is a multidirectional shooter video game, created by Iain McLeod, with basic gameplay similar to the 1979 arcade game &quot;Asteroids&quot;. The game has bright colours and patterns, with many enemies on screen at once. The audio is similar to that of &quot;&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot;. It was originally written for RISC OS on the Acorn Archimedes and released in 1993. In the 2000s it was ported to Linux, Microsoft Windows, and PS2 Linux. In October 2007, &quot;Spheres of Chaos&quot; was declared freeware.

== Gameplay==
The player controls a small grey spaceship. At the start of each level, enemies called &quot;common aliens&quot; appear that must be eradicated to complete the level. With each subsequent level, the enemies get more plentiful and powerful. 

When hit, enemies typically split into smaller versions which must also be eradicated. Black holes also appear that either attract or repel the spaceship. Many black holes at once may make the game field unnavigable. When a level isn&#x27;t completed within a certain period of time, enemies called &quot;bugs&quot; appear that shoot at the spaceship. 

Many types of enemies appear in later levels, from &quot;spinshooters&quot; to multiplying &quot;daisies&quot; and &quot;bacteria&quot;. Often, when all common aliens are defeated, a boss appears that takes many hits to destroy.

When defeated, some enemies provide power-ups that constantly change colour. A power-up&#x27;s power is determined by its colour when the spaceship captures it. 

Up to eight players can take turns playing and have control over a wide variety of options, including quantities of specific enemies, frequency of power-ups, and visual effects.

<text>Rhamnus is a genus of about 140 accepted species of shrubs or small trees, commonly known as buckthorns, in the family Rhamnaceae. Its species range from tall (rarely to ) and are native mainly in east Asia and North America, but found throughout the temperate and subtropical Northern Hemisphere, and also more locally in the subtropical Southern Hemisphere in parts of Africa and South America. One species, the common buckthorn (&quot;Rhamnus cathartica&quot;), is able to flourish as an invasive plant in parts of Canada and the United States, where it has become naturalized.

Both deciduous and evergreen species occur. The leaves are simple, long, and arranged alternately, in opposite pairs, or almost paired (subopposite). One distinctive character of many buckthorns is the way the veination curves upward towards the tip of the leaf. The plant bears fruits which are black or red berry-like drupes. The name is due to the woody spine on the end of each twig in many species. One species is known to have potential to be used medicinally.

==Description==
&quot;Rhamnus&quot; species are shrubs or small to medium-sized trees, with deciduous or rarely evergreen foliage. Branches are unarmed or end in a woody spine. The leaf blades are undivided and pinnately veined. Leaf margins are serrate or rarely entire. &quot;Rhamnus&quot; species are generally dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Most species have yellowish green, small, unisexual or rarely polygamous flowers; which are produced singly or in axillary cymes, cymose racemes, or cymose panicles containing a few flowers. Calyx tube campanulate to cup-shaped, with 4 or 5 ovate-triangular sepals, which are adaxially ± distinctly keeled. Petals 4 or 5 but a few species may lack petals. The petals are shorter than the sepals. Flowers have 4 or 5 stamens which are surrounded by and equal in length the petals or are shorter. The anthers are dorsifixed. The superior ovary is free, rounded, with 2-4 chambers. Fruits are a 2-4 stoned, berrylike drupe, which is obovoid-globose or globose shaped. Seeds are obovoid or oblong-obovoid shaped, unfurrowed or abaxially or laterally margined with a long, narrow, furrow. The seeds have fleshy endosperm.

==Distribution==
&quot;Rhamnus&quot; has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, with about 140 species which are native from temperate to tropical regions, the majority of species are from east Asia and North America, with a few species in Europe and Africa.

North American species include &quot;Rhamnus alnifolia&quot;, alder-leaf buckthorn, occurring across the continent, and &quot;Rhamnus crocea&quot;, hollyleaf buckthorn, in the west. Though not native to this region, &quot;Rhamnus cathartica&quot; can be found in North America.

Buckthorns may be confused with dogwoods, which share the curved leaf venation; indeed, &quot;dogwood&quot; is a local name for &quot;R. prinoides&quot; in southern Africa. The two plants are easy to distinguish by slowly pulling a leaf apart; dogwoods will exude thin, white latex strings, while buckthorns will not.

==Invasive species==
&quot;Rhamnus cathartica&quot;, the common buckthorn, is considered an invasive species in the United States and by many local jurisdictions and state governments, including Minnesota and Wisconsin.

The common buckthorn is well-adapted to spreading in Canada and the U.S. It is an efficient grower that does not need much sunlight and or fertile soil. Its seeds are hardy, as well as being able to grow and spread easily in a variety of environmental conditions. Also other animals prefer to leave buckthorns alone because their leaves are not appetizing and their fruits are toxic to some animals. Overall they are known to have a negative effect on their surrounding environment. For example, the European buckthorn is blamed for increased frog egg mortality from a chemical it releases. Other species, such as the &quot;Rhamnus alaternus&quot; also make chemicals that prevent other animals from consuming them.

==Ecology==
Some species are invasive outside their natural ranges. &quot;R. cathartica&quot; was introduced into the United States as a garden shrub and has become an invasive species in many areas there. It is a primary host of the soybean aphid (&quot;Aphis glycines&quot;), a pest for soybean farmers across the US. The aphids use the buckthorn as a host for the winter and then spread to nearby soybean fields in the spring. Italian buckthorn (&quot;R. alaternus&quot;), an evergreen species from the Mediterranean region, has become a serious weed in some parts of New Zealand, especially on Hauraki Gulf islands.

Buckthorns are used as food plants by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species.

The American species are known to be hosts for the oat fungus &quot;Puccinia coronata&quot;. In a 1930 study, both kerosene and salt were employed for eradication of &quot;R. lanceolata&quot; and both proved to be less expensive than felling these bushes.

==Uses==
The fruit of most species contain a yellow dye and the seeds are rich in protein. Oils from the seeds are used for making lubricating oil, printing ink, and soap. Many species have been used to make dyes. &quot;R. utilis&quot; provides china green, a dye used to give a bright green color to silk and wool. The bark of some species of &quot;Rhamnus&quot; afford a beautiful yellow dye. Another species, Avignon buckthorn (&quot;R. saxatilis&quot;) produces a yellow dye, made from the fruit Persian berry.

Some species may cause demyelinating polyneuropathies.

The purging buckthorn (&quot;R. cathartica&quot;) is a widespread European native species used in the past as a purgative. It was in mid 17th-century England the only native purgative. It was also known pre-Linnaeus as &quot;Spina Cervina&quot;. The berries of &quot;Spina Cervina&quot; are black and contain a greenish juice, along with four seeds apiece; this serves to distinguish them from those of the black alder and dogberry, which contain only one or two apiece. Its syrup is said to be churlish. Its toxicity makes this a very risky herbal medicine, and it is no longer in use.

&quot;Rhamnus prinoides&quot; is known as &quot;gesho&quot; in Ethiopia, where it is used to make a mead called &quot;tej&quot;.

The species &quot;Rhamnus alaternus&quot; shows some promise for medicinal use as well.

<text>The National Security Guard (NSG) is a central armed police force in India under the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is the primary counter-terrorism force of the Government of India. It was founded on 16 October 1984, following Operation Blue Star, to combat terrorist activities and protect states against internal disturbances.

The formation of the NSG was formalised in the Parliament of India under the National Security Guard Act, 1986. NSG personnel are recruited from both the Indian Army and Central Armed Police Forces.

== History ==
The NSG was established in the wake of 1984 Operation Blue Star, and the high collateral damage to Golden Temple, and civilian and military collateral casualties. Since its founding the NSG has been deployed in the Punjab in 1986, and Jammu and Kashmir. Some of the NSG&#x27;s known operations include:
* 29–30 April 1986: About 300 NSG commandos and 700 Border Security Force troops stormed the Golden Temple in Operation Black Thunder I. The Temple was cleared and handed over to Punjab Police on 1 May 1986. 300 Sikh militants were captured, and there were no deaths or injuries for either side.
* January 1988: The NSG conducted Op Black Hawk, a heliborne operation in the Mand area of Punjab. In this operation, two terrorists were killed and one 7.62mm rifle was recovered. It was a massive operation, says former NSG Director-General Ved Marwah, though it did not get many spectacular results like in Black Thunder.
* 12 May 1988: 1,000 NSG commandos (all ranks) surrounded the Golden Temple for yet another assault, in Operation Black Thunder II. Sniper teams armed with Heckler &amp; Koch PSG-1 rifles with night scopes took up positions, including atop a 300-foot water tower. While commandos from the 51 SAG were divided into assault squadrons, the SRG was used to seal off the area around the temple and for tactical support. In the three-day operation between 15 and 18 May 1988, the NSG cleared the temple. 40 terrorists were killed, and 200 surrendered. In the mid-1990s, an NSG battalion was again deployed in Punjab to confront the Sikh rioters. There they began training the Punjab Police in counter-terrorism.
* 5 September – 15 January 1988: Guarding of high-risk terrorist code-named &#x27;Jack&#x27;.
* 4 August 1989: Operation Mouse Trap in the Tarn Taran district, Punjab, in conjunction with Punjab Police and other security forces. NSG was able to demonstrate that it was possible to achieve area dominance at night if the strategy and tactics were right. Ved Marwah calls this Operation Night Dominance.
* 10 November 1990: NSG task force flown to Kolkata to rescue hostages of a Thai Airbus by Burmese students.
* 25–26 January 1991: The NSG was involved in Operation Ani Ben, on CI tasks in Baroda, (Gujarat) where Punjab terrorists were holed up inside a house. Two terrorists were killed and two AK-47s were recovered.
* 1 July-20 September 1991: NSG employed along with SIT in search and strike missions after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.
* 25 November – 16 December 1992: 150 commandos were deployed at Ayodhya during the Ram Janambhoomi and Babri Masjid crisis.
* 27 March 1993: 52 SAG mobilised and moved to Adampur for the rescue of hostages of Indian Airlines Flight IC 486.
* 24–25 April 1993: NSG Commandos stormed a hijacked Indian Airlines Boeing 737 with 141 passengers on board at Amritsar airport during Operation Ashwamedh. Two hijackers, including their leader, Mohammed Yousuf Shah, were killed and one was disarmed before any hostages were harmed.
* October 1998: As part of the implementation of the Union Home Ministry&#x27;s decision to conduct pro-active strikes against militants, commando teams supported by IAF Mi-25/35 helicopter gun-ships began striking at terrorist groups deep inside the mountains and forests of Kashmir. After helicopter reconnaissance was conducted to pinpoint the militants, the commandos – comprising NSG and Rashtriya Rifles personnel – were para-dropped, along with supplies, into the area to hunt the militants. They had to rely on these supplies and their ability to live off the land until replenishment every fortnight or so. These missions are possibly ongoing.
* 15 July 1999: NSG commandos ended a 30-hour standoff by killing two terrorists and rescuing all 12 hostages unharmed in J&amp;K. The terrorists had attacked a BSF campus near Srinagar, and killed three officers and the wife of another. The 12 hostages were kept locked in a room.
* 21 August 1999: After interrogating three captured terrorists, the Delhi Police Crime branch confirmed that two more terrorists were hiding in a one-storied house in Rudrapur, Uttar Pradesh. Since the terrorists were considered armed and dangerous (their colleagues were arrested with 100+ pounds of RDX), the Delhi Police sought assistance from the NSG. A 16-man team arrived at the house at 4:45  am. They began their assault at 5:30  am, before first light. The first militant managed to fire at the commandos with a pistol he kept by his bedside, but was killed an instant later. The second terrorist was shot before he had a chance to fire and died 40 minutes later. No NSG personnel were injured.
* December 1999: Terrorists hijacked Indian Airlines flight IC814 from Nepal, and landed in Amritsar, Punjab. Within minutes of landing, the Crisis Management Group (CMG), which authorised the use of the NSG, was informed. But the CMG wasted precious hours and by the time the go-ahead was issued, it was too late. On the other hand, the NSG team on alert was elsewhere and no other team was raised during the delay. The hijacked plane took off before the NSG reached Amritsar Airport. The plane landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan where one hostage was killed. Finally, the Indian Government agreed to the terrorists&#x27; demands to release three jailed terrorists. The hostages were released and the terrorists escaped to Pakistan.
* February 2000: Following the Flight IC 814 fiasco, the Indian Government decided to implement an Air Marshaling programme. At least two NSG operators were to be present on flights over select routes. These operators would be armed with weapons firing lethal, but low-velocity, fragmentation rounds to minimise danger to the passengers and prevent penetration of the aircraft. Another decision taken was to deploy NSG teams permanently at eight sensitive airports around the country, especially those bordering Pakistan and the North East. This decision was to cut short reaction times for the NSG and eliminate the hassles involved in flying the teams to the hijack site. It is not known if this plan has been put into action.
* September 2002 – SAG commandos flew to Karnataka to catch sandalwood smuggler and forest brigand Veerappan in the wake of the kidnapping of a former minister of the state cabinet, Nagappa. They pulled out after suggesting that intelligence for the operation was inadequate. A small team was left behind to help, the hostage was eventually killed in December 2002.
* October 2002 – Two terrorists attacked the Akshardham temple complex in Gujarat. NSG flew in, delayed by traffic in Delhi. They carried out assaults in which one commando was killed and another one was seriously injured and died after 18 months in a coma. By morning, the terrorists were neutralised and the operation was completed successfully.
* December 2002 – Terrorists attacked the Raghunath temple in Jammu. NSG was ready to be flown out but was called back at the last minute.
* 2008 Mumbai attacks – Operation Black Tornado and Operation Cyclone to flush out terrorists &amp; rescue hostages after multiple attacks across Mumbai, India. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan and Havaldar Gajender Singh Bisht of the NSG&#x27;s 51 Special Action Group were killed in action during the operations. Over 900 rooms were scanned, 8 terrorists killed and over 600 hostages rescued during the operation.
* 2013 Hyderabad blasts – Deployed in Hyderabad after the bomb blasts.
* 2013 Bangalore Bomb Blast – NSG was deployed in Bangalore after the bomb blast took place in the city.
* 2013 Patna bombings – A team of the NSG, which was sent to Patna for post-blasts analysis, said at least three more Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) were defused.
* 2016 Pathankot attack – An NSG team took part in the operation to neutralise terrorists where Lt. Col. Niranjan lost his life defusing a grenade or IED booby-trapped on the body of a dead terrorist, and 12 other members of the unit were injured. Six terrorists were neutralised in the operation by the NSG, Defence Security Corps and the Garud Commando Force
* May 2023 – A team of NSG Commandos was deployed in Srinagar, Jammu &amp; Kashmir along with a team of MARCOS Commandos to provide security to the G20 delegates during the 3rd G20 Tourism Working Group Meeting held at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre on the banks of Dal Lake in Srinagar during May 22–24.

==Roles==
The NSG is a &#x27;contingency deployment force&#x27; which generally intervenes during serious terrorist attacks. It has been described as &quot;New Delhi’s go-to response force in worst case scenarios&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsg, 22/8&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


As a specialized counter-terrorism force, it is intended to be used &quot;only in exceptional situations&quot; and is not meant to take over the functions of the State Police Forces or other Central Armed Police Forces.

A small unit of the NSG has been present in Kashmir since 2018, when the proposal to deploy around 100 commandos in Kashmir to support the Indian forces in high risk operations was approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The NBDC, which is a specialized agency operating within the NSG, has also occasionally supported local law enforcement by conducting Post Blast Investigations.

==Organisation==
The organization was initially inspired by and modelled on the British Special Air Service as well as Germany&#x27;s GSG 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsg, 16/9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehram Nagar, Palam, serves as the administrative headquarters for the NSG. The headquarters is overseen by the Director-General of the NSG, who is assisted in administrative matters by four Indian Police Service officers, out of whom two are Inspectors Generals at the Administrative Headquarters. They are in turn assisted by the Deputy Inspectors General of the NSG. The Financial Advisor of the NSG is generally an officer with the rank of Joint Secretary belonging to the Central Accounts Services and is assisted by two Deputy Financial Advisors belonging of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service and the Indian Civil Accounts Service respectively. A small unit of the NSG is present near Palam Nagar.

Manesar is the operational headquarters of the NSG. An Indian Army Major general who is deputed to NSG Manesar headquarters is designated as the Inspector General of NSG&#x27;s operations. The Inspector General is responsible for the planning and conducting of operations. Training is overseen by the Inspector General of Training, also a major general on deputation from the army. Both of them are further assisted by the Deputy Inspector General of Operations and the Deputy Inspector General of Training respectively. The combat arms of the NSG consist of two Special Action Groups and three Special Ranger Groups stationed at its Manesar headquarters, five Special Composite Groups posted at each of its five regional hubs as well as the National Bomb Data Centre and the Electronic Support Centre also based at its operational headquarters in Manesar.

===Special Action Groups (SAG)===

The NSG has two Special Action Groups – the 51 Special Action Group and the 52 Special Action Group. The 51 Special Action Group was the first unit to be set up when the NSG was created in 1986. The 51 SAG is tasked with counterterrorism and counter insurgency operations while the 52 SAG deals with anti-hijacking operations and is also known as &quot;Hijack Busters&quot;. The smallest operational unit within a Special Action Group is called a hit and consists of 5 members: two pairs (partners) and a technical support member. Four hits make a team that is led by a &quot;Team Commander&quot;. SAG personnel are drawn from the Indian Army. The 51 SAG used to be the primary combat arm of the NSG with the SRGs serving in support roles until the 2010s when the 52 SAG was formed and the 11 SRG, along with the 51 SAG was made a part of the counter-terrorism force (CTF).

===Special Ranger Groups (SRG)===

NSG has three Special Ranger Groups (SRG) – 11, 12 &amp; 13. Special Ranger Groups are organised into battalion lines. The SRG was initially the logistic arm of the NSG which performed low-risk combat roles such as cordons. Later, they were being used almost exclusively for VIP security. In 2012, the role of the 11 SRG was elevated to that of SAG units, and the 11 SRG was made a part of the counter-terrorism force (CTF) which included the 51 SAG and 11 SRG. However, the other two SRGs continued to be used for VIP security purposes until October 2024 when the central government decided to withdraw it from VVIP protection duties. SRG members are drawn mainly from the Central Armed Police Force personnel.

===Special Composite Group (SCG)===

Special Composite Groups are stationed at the regional hubs of the National Security Guard. Special Composite Group units consisting of personnel from both, the Indian Army and the Central Armed Police Forces, and respond to incidents that happen near their hubs. Each SCG is headed by an officer with the rank of Colonel on deputation from the Indian Army who serves with the rank of &#x27;Group Commander&#x27;. The five SCG units are:
*26 SCG Mumbai
*27 SCG Chennai
*28 SCG Hyderabad
*29 SCG Kolkata
*30 SCG Gandhinagar

===Electronic Support Group (ESG)===

The electronic support group is based at the NSG&#x27;s headquarters at Manesar. It provides communicational and technological assistance to support the operations of the NSG. The group is headed by an officer with the rank of &quot;Group Commander&quot; serving on deputation from the Indian Army.

===National Bomb Data Centre===
The National Bomb Data Centre (NBDC) was established in the year 1988 and redefined its role in the year 2000. NBDC was assigned the role of monitoring, recording, and analyzing all bombing incidents in the country. It also records and analyses various bombing incidents across the world to gain expert knowledge in bombing and related incidents to effectively counter such situations and share information with relevant security agencies. NBDC also performs research and development in the field of explosives engineering. The NBDC act as a nodal agency for all bombing related facets in the country. It is headed by a Group Commander who is either an Army officer with the rank of &#x27;colonel&#x27; or a Central Armed Police Force officer belonging to any force apart from the NSG itself with the rank of &#x27;Commandant&#x27;.

===Regional deployment===

In response to the criticism received by the force for its failure to quickly arrive in Mumbai during the 2008 Mumbai attacks, from its base in Manesar, Haryana, the Ministry of Home Affairs decided to deploy NSG contingents in major regions across India in order to avoid the occurrence of such situations in the future. Each hub of the NSG is headed by an officer called the Director General of the Hub.

====New Delhi====
The regional hub in New Delhi is designated for Web Information Management.

====Mumbai====
The Mumbai regional hub is spread across 20.28 acres and has been constructed for Rs. 56.10 crore by the National Building Construction Corporation Limited. It has accommodation for the families of the commandos as well. Approximately 241 commandos will be housed there.

====Hyderabad====
Hyderabad is the regional hub of the National Security Guard for the region of South India. Its training center is located near Hyderabad, Telangana, India. With the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) giving its nod and sanctioning in 2017, the Southern Regional Centre (SRC) was established at Ibrahimpatnam, Hyderabad for training commandos. The hub land area is and constructed at a cost of .

The Hyderabad hub of the 28 Special Composite Group (SCG) of the NSG is among the five regional hubs in the country. By 2018, 300 commandos were stationed at the NSG hub at Trimulgherry. The state has two trained anti-terror striking forces. Besides the NSG, the Telangana Police&#x27;s counter-terrorist group, OCTOPUS, also has a training facility in the same neighborhood at Ibrahimpatnam, that has a strength of over 250 personnel. NSG and OCTOPUS personnel undergo a grueling training process. The commandos are sent back to their parent department when they reach the age of 35, ensuring that the force remains young and physically fit for combat operations.

====Chennai====
NSG Chennai Hub was established in 2009 as the third regional hub. Till 2012, the commandos were temporarily stationed at Ashok Nagar when the permanent facility was inaugurated by India&#x27;s then-home minister P.Chidambaram, with the training center lying between forests and hillocks at Nedungundram off the Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road.

==== Kolkata ====
Kolkata became the regional hub of the NSG for the region of East India in 2009, becoming the 4th such hub in the country. The Salt Lake campus was supposed to serve as its main base until the construction of its planned permanent facility at Badu in Madhyamgram (North 24 Parganas) was fully completed. In 2012, the permanent facility was inaugurated by India&#x27;s then Home Minister P. Chidambaram. The NSG hub in Kolkata had about 241 commandos by then, but the regional hub was still incomplete. On 1st March 2020, the fully complete 29 Special Composite Group complex was inaugurated by the Home Minister Amit Shah at New Town, West Bengal.

==== Gandhinagar ====
In July 2018, NSG operationalized its fifth regional hub at Gandhinagar in Gujarat. The hub stands on 1.33 lakh sq m of land near the Randesan village and contains 100 NSG commandos, training facilities, living barracks, and logistical support.

====Future====

NSG has proposed Amritsar as a regional hub to improve its counteraction capabilities in Northern India. NSG has considered other cities or regions like Ayodhya, Pathankot, and Kerala. In July 2024, an NSG team reached Ayodhya to carry out a 4-day exercise with coordination from other CAPF units and assess the security structure of the city. The NSG hub in Ayodhya is equipped with specialized weaponry and anti-drone technology that is expected to be operationalized along with support units of other CAPFs within a few months. The land allocation process for the hub has begun. The Ayodhya hub will be the first response center for NSG in Uttar Pradesh. After the establishment of these three hubs by 2024-end, there will be a total of eight NSG hubs in India.

==Personnel==
The NSG consists entirely of volunteers on deputation from the Central Armed Police Forces, or the State Police departments and the Indian Army. NSG commandos are sent back to their parent department after serving with the force for a certain period. The Director General of the National Security Guard is an officer from the Indian Police Service. Women belonging to the Central Armed Police Forces have been serving in the NSG since 2012.

==Selection and training==

Selection is demanding and has a dropout rate of about 70–80 percent. The NSG has a 14-month long training course, which spans three phases. The eligibility of trainees is assessed in the selection stage which consists of various tests related to the physical and psychological capabilities of the trainees. A cadet has to meet certain physical, psychological, and educational experience-related criteria to clear this stage. The second stage is selection and basic training which is conducted at the National Security Guard Academy in Manesar lasts for three months and is devoted to the basics. The physical fitness training is believed to have 26 elements, ranging from a cross-country obstacle course to jumping from heights and across divides and scaling different kinds of terrain. One endurance test involves martial arts, target shooting at the end of an obstacle-ridden cross-country run. Such exercises are supposedly meant to assess how the candidate would likely perform under stress and exhaustion. Those who complete the tests are sent for nine months of advanced training.

Advanced training reportedly includes techniques related to hand-to-hand combat, intelligence gathering, demolition, bomb disposal, insertion, and reflex shooting. Well-publicised training exercises include the &#x27;combat room shoot&#x27; where the candidates have to shoot at a target three seconds after entering a dark room with the help of a torchlight or a compatible laser image intensifier and &#x27;twin room shooting&#x27; where candidates enter contiguous rooms and watch each other&#x27;s movements on a screen which they have to shoot at to train their response time. Another known exercise requiring candidates to shoot at a target placed next to their buddy is also a part of the Indian Army Special Forces training. Shooting skills are practiced at a 400-meter, 11-zone electronic combat shooting range where candidates are rated on a point scale for covering the distance in 6.30 minutes and firing at 29 different dynamic targets with the target exposure time lying between two and three minutes. Before being inducted into the NSG, aspirants also have to undergo a rigorous psychological test.

=== Joint Training Exercises ===
The NSG frequently participates in training exercises. The majority of them are with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Green Berets who regularly participate in training exercises with the NSG. The two forces conduct an annual counterterrorism training exercise called TARKASH.

=== Germany ===
After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the NSG decided to have a joint exercise with the German GSG 9. In November 2009, a team from NSG visited the GSG 9 headquarters. Joint training exercises between GSG 9 and NSG were subsequently conducted in Manesar.

===United States===

Exercise between NSG and United States Army Special Forces, code-named &quot;Balanced Iroquois&quot;, started on 18 October 2015. This three-week-long exercise was preceded by a joint airborne jump at Aero India 2015. In February 2018, Green Berets from the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) conducted a joint training exercise with the NSG in Kolkata. The Green Berets learned some urban warfare strategies from the NSG while the NSG learned about some advanced equipment of the US soldiers. The drill included intervention techniques, training in the Kolkata Metro system and a drill at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.

In March 2019, the NSG and US 1st Special Forces Group carried out joint exercises in Hyderabad.

<doc id="951103" wikidata="Q814003" url="?curid=951103" title="Beechcraft Twin Bonanza">
<text>The Beechcraft Model 50 Twin Bonanza is a small twin-engined aircraft designed by Beechcraft as an executive transport for the business market. It was developed to fill a gap in Beechcraft&#x27;s product line between the single-engined Model 35 Bonanza and the larger Model 18. The Twin Bonanza is dissimilar to the Bonanza, being much larger and heavier and using more powerful engines, while in its earliest form having only half the passenger capacity of the Model 18.

==Development==
The Twin Bonanza was first flown on November 15, 1949 after rapid development, begun only in April of that year. The aircraft was first designed to use Franklin engines with superchargers, but engine company owner Preston Tucker diverted all of its aviation resources to support his ill-fated Tucker 48 automobile project, and the aircraft was hastily modified to accept the Lycoming GO-435. However, the engine nacelles were not redesigned to fit the smaller Lycoming, creating unusually generous internal clearances that facilitate engine maintenance. The Model 50&#x27;s type certificate was awarded in 1951, and production began the same year. The Twin Bonanza is one of only a few light twin-engined civil aircraft certificated in the utility category, and was the first production light aircraft to feature shoulder belts.

Despite its name, the Twin Bonanza is a substantially larger and heavier aircraft that is mostly dissimilar to the single-engined Bonanza; the only major shared parts are the front fuselage sides and windows, and on early models, the main cabin door. The Twin Bonanza fuselage is wider than that of the Bonanza.

The United States Army adopted the Twin Bonanza as the L-23 Seminole utility transport, making it the largest fixed-wing aircraft in its inventory at that time. According to Ralph Harmon, the airplane&#x27;s designer, during an initial demonstration flight for the Army, Beechcraft test pilot Claude Palmer crashed while trying to land over a tree line with the aircraft full of soldiers and sandbags. Everyone on board walked away from the crash. The Army was impressed with the structural strength of the Twin Bonanza, eventually purchasing 216 of the 994 examples produced. It was also the first twin-engined aircraft in its class to be offered to the business market, but the Korean War was raging in the early 1950s and the US Army took almost the entire production for 1952 and 1953. 

The Beechcraft Model 65 Queen Air and Model 90 King Air are both direct descendants of the Model 50 Twin Bonanza. All three aircraft share the same basic wing design, as well as landing gear, flaps, instrument panels, fuel cells, and more. The Queen Air added a larger cabin to the design, while the later King Air added turbine power and pressurization. Twin Bonanza production ended in 1963 while the King Air was under development.

==Design==
The Twin Bonanza is an all-metal low-wing monoplane with a cantilever wing and retractable tricycle landing gear, initially powered by two wing-mounted geared Lycoming GO-435 piston engines, each with a wooden two-bladed propeller. The standard cabin seats six people on bench seats, three in the front and three in the rear, and several other seating configurations were offered, including club seating and a three-person sideways-facing couch. Early models had a single right-hand door above the wing, accessed by trailing edge steps, while later aircraft added a rear airstair door with retracting steps. The GO-435 was replaced by the Lycoming GO-480 in 1954; this engine was subsequently upgraded with fuel injection and then superchargers, increasing power to in 1956 and in 1957.

In addition to its seating configuration, the Twin Bonanza has several other unusual design features. The main landing gear wheels retract only partially into the engine nacelles, leaving the tires exposed to assist in the event of a belly landing and allowing the pilot some directional control using differential braking. The aircraft is equipped with a tailskid to mitigate damage from a badly executed or belly landing. The exposed main wheels and tailskid potentially allow a Twin Bonanza equipped with two-bladed props to be belly-landed with minimal damage if the props are stopped horizontally. In many Twin Bonanzas, the copilot&#x27;s seat and rudder pedals are not on the right as is customary, but instead are positioned in the center of the front seat; the pilots pivot the single &quot;throwover&quot; control yoke to the center for the copilot to fly. Instead of conventional cowl flaps for low-speed engine cooling, the engines are equipped with exhaust augmenter tubes that create a low-pressure area inside the engine nacelles, drawing in additional cooling air. The combination of the augmenter tubes and low propeller RPM and high engine RPM from the geared engines gives the Twin Bonanza a characteristic sound.

&quot;Junior JATO&quot; rocket motors mounted to the tops of the engine nacelles were briefly offered as a factory option for the Twin Bonanza. Unlike most JATO systems intended to shorten takeoff distance, the Twin Bonanza motors were nominally intended to keep the aircraft aloft during in-flight emergencies or forced landings. However, it is unclear whether this feature was ever installed on a production aircraft or used in any instance other than test flights.

==Operational history==
The Twin Bonanza had trouble competing with the similarly capable but substantially lighter Cessna 310 and Piper PA-23, so Beechcraft used the basic single-engined Bonanza fuselage and many other Bonanza parts to create the Twin Bonanza&#x27;s effective replacements: the Travel Air and the closely related Baron. The Twin Bonanza has been plagued by a reputation for slow cruise speed, poor fuel economy and high engine overhaul costs relative to other six to eight-seat light piston twins; this has historically kept resale values low, but many owners praise its reliability, good outwards visibility, stable flying qualities and generous interior space, particularly when the three-wide seats are not fully occupied.

The Twin Bonanza is popularly known as the &quot;Twin Bo&quot; or the &quot;T-Bone&quot;.

In January 2012, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued an airworthiness directive grounding all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas, and Debonairs equipped with a single pole-style yoke, having forward elevator control cables more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff, and resulting concerns about the age of the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding, some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced, and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a &quot;Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin&quot; (SAIB) requesting that the elevator control cables be inspected during the annual inspection.

<text>The simulation heuristic is a psychological heuristic, or simplified mental strategy, according to which people determine the likelihood of an event based on how easy it is to picture the event mentally. Partially as a result, people experience more regret over outcomes that are easier to imagine, such as &quot;near misses&quot;. The simulation heuristic was first theorized by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky as a specialized adaptation of the availability heuristic to explain counterfactual thinking and regret. However, it is not the same as the availability heuristic. Specifically the simulation heuristic is defined as &quot;how perceivers tend to substitute normal antecedent events for exceptional ones in psychologically &#x27;undoing&#x27; this specific outcome.&quot;

Kahneman and Tversky also believed that people used this heuristic to understand and predict other&#x27;s behavior in certain circumstances and to answer questions involving counterfactual propositions. People, they believe, do this by mentally undoing events that have occurred and then running mental simulations of the events with the corresponding input values of the altered model. For example, a study was proposed that provided a group of participants with a situation describing two men who were delayed by half an hour in a traffic jam on the way to the airport. Both men were delayed enough that they both missed flights on which they were booked, one of them by half an hour and the second by only five minutes (because his flight had been delayed for 25 minutes). The results showed that a greater number of participants thought that the second man would be more upset than the first man.

Kahneman and Tversky argued that this difference could not be attributed to disappointment, because both had expected to miss their flights. They believed instead that the true explanation was that the students utilized the simulation heuristic and so it was easier for them to imagine minor alterations that would have enabled the second man to arrive in time for his flight than it was for them to devise the same alterations for the first man.

==History==
This heuristic was introduced by the Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman (born 1934) and Amos Tversky (1937–96) in a lecture in 1979. It was published as a book chapter in 1982.

==Difference from the availability heuristic==
The subjective probability judgments of an event used in the simulation heuristic do not follow the availability heuristic, in that these judgments are not the cause of relevant examples in memory but are instead based on the ease with which situations that did not happen can be mentally simulated or imagined.

==Application==
The theory that underlies the simulation heuristic assumes that one&#x27;s judgments are biased towards information that is easily imagined or simulated mentally. It is because of this that we see biases having to do with the overestimation of how causally plausible an event could be or the enhanced regret experienced when it is easy to mentally undo an unfortunate event, such as an accident. Significant research on simulation heuristic&#x27;s application in counterfactual reasoning has been performed by Dale T Miller and Bryan Taylor.

For example, they found that if an affectively negative experience, such as a fatal car accident was brought about by an extraordinary event, such as someone who usually goes by train to work but instead drove, the simulation heuristic will cause an emotional reaction of regret. This emotional reaction is because the exceptional event is easy to mentally undo and replace with a more common one that would not have caused the accident.

Kahneman and Tversky did a study in which two individuals were given lottery tickets and then were given the opportunity to sell those same tickets back either two weeks before the drawing or an hour before the drawing. They proposed this question to some participants whose responses showed that they believed that the man who had sold his ticket an hour before the drawing would experience the greatest anticipatory regret when that ticket won.

Kahneman and Tversky explained these findings through the understanding of the norm theory, by stating that &quot;people&#x27;s anticipatory regret, along with reluctance to sell the ticket, should increase with their ease of imagining themselves still owning the winning ticket&quot;. Therefore, the man who recently sold his ticket will experience more regret because the &quot;counterfactual world&quot;, in which he is the winner, is perceived as closer for him than the man who sold his ticket two weeks ago. This example shows the bias in this type of thinking because both men had the same probability of winning if they had not sold their tickets and the time differences in which they did will not increase or decrease these chances.

Similar results were found with plane crash survivors. These individuals experienced a greater amount of anticipatory regret when they engaged in the highly mutable action of switching flights last minute. It was reasoned that this was due to a person &quot;anticipating counterfactual thoughts that a negative event was evoked, because it tends to make the event more vivid, and so tends to make it more subjectively likely&quot;.

== Applications ==
This heuristic has shown to be a salient feature of clinical anxiety and its disorders, which are marked by heighted expectations of future negative events. A study done by David Raune and Andrew Macleod tried to tie the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this type of judgment to the simulation heuristic.

Their findings showed that anxious patient&#x27;s simulation heuristic scores were correlated with the subjective probability. Such that, the more reasons anxious patients could think of why negative events would happen, relative to the number why they would not happen, the higher their subjective probability judgment that the events would happen to them. Further it was found that anxious patients displayed increase access to the simulation compared to control patients.

They also found support for the hypothesis that the easier it was for anxious patients to form the visual image, the greater the subjective probability that the event would happen to them. Through this work they purposed that the main clinical implication of the simulation heuristic results is that, in order to lower elevated subjective probability in clinical anxiety, patients should be encouraged to think of more reasons why the negative events will not occur then why they will occur .

==How it is affected by other heuristics==
A study done by Philip Broemer was done to test the hypothesis that the subjective ease with which one can imagine a symptom will be affected by the impact of differently framed messages on attitudes toward performing health behaviors. 

By drawing on the simulation heuristic, he argued that the vividness of information is reflected in the subjective ease with which people can imagine having symptoms of an illness.

His results showed that the impact of message framing upon attitudes was moderated by the ease of imagination and clearly supported the congruency hypothesis for different kinds of health behavior. Finding that, negatively framed messages led to more positive attitudes when the recipients of these messages could easily imagine the relevant symptoms. Ease of imagination thus facilitates persuasion when messages emphasize potential health risks. A positive framing however, leads to more positive attitudes when symptom imagination was rather difficult.

Therefore, a message with a reassuring theme is more congruent with a recipient&#x27;s state of mind when he or she cannot easily imagine the symptoms whereas a message with an aversive theme is more congruent with a recipient&#x27;s state of mind when he or she can easily imagine having the symptoms .

<text>Mikael Karl Tellqvist (born 19 September 1979) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey goaltender who last played for Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Hockey League, his second tenure with the club.

== Playing career ==
Tellqvist was drafted 70th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. He had played a total of 14 games for the Leafs before the 2005–06 season, spending most of his time with their then American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs.

In 2003, Tellqvist played in the world hockey championship. Here is where he represented Sweden. During this time he recorded a 1.37 goals against average and a .940 save percentage. But unfortunately the run came to an end when they played Canada in the finals. They would lose and capture silver.

At the end of the 2005–06 season, when starting Maple Leafs goaltender Ed Belfour was injured, Tellqvist played in two consecutive games against the Montreal Canadiens when the Leafs were struggling to make the playoffs near the end of the season. He struggled in those games, letting in 11 total goals. Following the second game, he was replaced by Toronto&#x27;s third-string goaltender, Jean-Sébastien Aubin.

On November 28, 2006, Tellqvist was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for forward Tyson Nash and a fourth-round draft pick in 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Later in the season, on February 16, 2007, the Coyotes signed him to a contract extension through to the 2007–08 season. On March 12, 2007, in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers, he stopped all 24 shots to record his fourth career NHL shutout. On April 3, 2007, he set a new career high in wins with 11.

For the 2007–08 season, Tellqvist competed for Phoenix&#x27;s starting goaltender position with Alex Auld and David Aebischer. Aebischer was eventually waived, setting up the tandem of Tellqvist and Auld. Upon the acquisition of Ilya Bryzgalov via waivers from the Anaheim Ducks, Auld was eventually traded to the Boston Bruins; Tellqvist became the back-up behind Bryzgalov.

On March 4, 2009, Tellqvist was traded by the Coyotes to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick in 2010. On May 1, 2009, Tellqvist signed with Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the 2009–10 season.

On November 19, 2009, Tellqvist was traded to Lukko in the Finnish SM-liiga. Lukko was at the time leading the League by 18 points, and is one of the leading candidates for the championship.

On August 4, 2010, it was announced that Tellqvist has signed with Dinamo Riga of the KHL for the 2010–11 season.

On November 2, 2017, Tellqvist officially announced his retirement as a player.

<doc id="951112" wikidata="Q531289" url="?curid=951112" title="Melvin E. Thompson">
<text>Melvin Ernest Thompson (May 1, 1903 – October 3, 1980) was an American educator and politician from Millen in the U.S. state of Georgia. Generally known as M.E. Thompson during his political career, he served as the 70th Governor of Georgia from 1947 to 1948 and was elected as the first Lieutenant Governor of Georgia in 1946.

==Early life and education==
Thompson was born in Millen, Georgia, to Henry Jackson Thompson and his wife Eva Edenfield Thompson. He was the youngest of seven children and his father died just after his first birthday. His father was a sharecropper. Thompson grew up in poverty, but through hard work and determination, he was able to leave the farm to pursue a higher education. He helped pay his way through college by working various jobs, including student teaching and the selling of bibles door to door. He graduated from Emory University in 1926, then earned a Master of Arts (M.A.) from the University of Georgia in 1935. He also earned all of the credits for a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia, but because his adviser died, he never defended his dissertation. Following his college career, Thompson worked in education, first as a teacher and coach, a principal, a district superintendent, moving all the way up to assistant school superintendent for the state. Thompson was a supporter of Governor Ellis Arnall and was hired as his Executive Secretary. Arnall then appointed him to the position of State Revenue Commissioner in 1945.

==Family==
Melvin Ernest Thompson married Dora Anne Newton, from Millen, Georgia, in 1926, and had one child, Melvin E. Thompson Jr., Melvin E. Thompson Jr. married Mary Bathsheba Carter and they had four children, Marianne Thea, Tarkenton Newton, Carter Maria and Melvin E. the 3rd. Melvin Jr. had a fifth child with his second wife Laura Mitchell, Charles Thompson.

==Lieutenant Governor of Georgia==

In 1946, Thompson ran for and won the newly created office of Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. Following Thompson&#x27;s election, Governor-elect Eugene Talmadge died on December 21, 1946, and the Georgia State Constitution was vague on who would be sworn in as governor, causing the three governors controversy. Thompson felt that as the Lieutenant Governor-elect, he should become the Governor. But the state legislature, controlled by Talmadge supporters, invoked a clause in the constitution allowing the legislature to pick between the second- and third-place candidates. The people who finished second and third were two write-in candidates, Eugene Talmadge&#x27;s son, Herman E. Talmadge and James V. Carmichael. The legislature elected Herman Talmadge as governor; he would hold that position temporarily.

==Governor of Georgia==

Thompson and Arnall both claimed the office of governor. Arnall later renounced his claim to support Thompson. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled that Thompson was the legitimate governor and that the legislature had violated the state constitution by selecting Talmadge. Thompson&#x27;s numerous achievements as the 70th Governor of Georgia include much needed improvements to highway infrastructure, public education, and the purchase of Jekyll Island, a beach retreat for the average Georgian. He was able to raise the salary of teachers, provide free books to students, and extend high school to the 12th grade. His purchase of Jekyll Island for $675,000 is still considered one of the greatest real estate purchases in U.S. history. Thompson was able to achieve many things during his shortened term, with very limited cooperation from the state legislature, and without raising taxes on the citizens of Georgia.

The resolution of the &quot;three governors controversy&quot; included holding a special election in 1948 for the remainder of Eugene Talmadge&#x27;s term. Thompson lost the special primary to Herman Talmadge.

==Later political activities==
Thompson unsuccessfully opposed Talmadge three additional times, twice in gubernatorial elections in 1950 and 1954 and finally in 1956 for one of Georgia&#x27;s United States Senate seats. In the mid-1950s, Thompson moved to Valdosta, Georgia, where he transitioned into a successful career as a real estate developer. Thompson died at the age of 77 on October 3, 1980, in Valdosta. His family turned down an offer for him to lie in state, in the rotunda of the State Capitol. He is interred in a mausoleum at McLane Riverview Memorial Gardens, in Valdosta.

== Highway dedication ==
In 2013 the Georgia Legislature by House Resolution 47 By: Representatives Shaw of the 176th, Carter of the 175th, Black of the 174th, Sharper of the 177th, and Houston of the 170th named a portion of Interstate 75 in Lowndes County from the West Hill Avenue exit to the North Valdosta Road exit is dedicated as the Governor Melvin Ernest Thompson Memorial Highway.[House Resolution 47 By: Representatives Shaw of the 176th, Carter of the 175th, Black of the 174th, Sharper of the 177th, and Houston of the 170th].

<text>The Prayer of Daniil Zatochnik, also translated as The Supplication of Daniel the Exile or Praying of Daniel the Immured (; ), is an Old East Slavic text created by the Pereyaslavl-born writer Daniil Zatochnik during the 13th century (estimated time 1213–1236).

==Text==
The work is written in the form of an epistle to Yaroslav Vsevolodovich, Prince of Pereyaslavl and Suzdal. The author appears to be in great need and begs the prince for help, depicting him as a defender of all his subjects. The text combines quotations from the Bible and Old Russian Chronicles with a highly rhythmic language, aphorisms, elements of humour and satire aimed against boyars and clergy; according to Dmitry Likhachov, &quot;Daniel’s deliberate coarseness and buffoonery are in the tradition of the skomorokh (a wandering minstrel-cum-clown)&quot;.

==History==
The origins of both the author and the text is a subject of speculation. Some researches state that &quot;The Supplication&quot; is based on the 12th-century The Speech or The Oration of Daniel the Exile () which was, in turn, addressed to some Prince Yaroslav, &quot;the son of the great tsar Vladimir&quot; (it is suggested that it was one of the sons of Vladimir II Monomakh, although he had no children by the name of Yaroslav). Others believe that &quot;The Oration&quot; itself is a late edition of &quot;The Supplication&quot;, yet the questions of literary correlation between the texts remain open.

Daniel is mentioned in the &quot;Simeonovskaya Chronicle&quot; (late 15th century), year 1387, in connection to some priest who was exiled to the Lake Lacha by Yuri Dolgorukiy &quot;same place as Daniel the Exile&quot;; yet nothing is known about Daniel himself, only that he did not belong to the ruling class and that he had been previously exiled after falling out of favour with the prince. Fyodor Buslaev suggested that he was the son of one of the prince&#x27;s slaves, Mikhail Tikhomirov concluded that Daniel was an artisan, while Dmitry Likhachov indicated that he belonged to intelligentsia and served as a &quot;milostnik&quot; (prince&#x27;s personal servant, a position similar to ministerialis).

Some researchers consider &quot;The Oration&quot; and &quot;The Supplication&quot; to be the first examples of Russian opinion journalism, while others name them among the &quot;pioneers of Russian samizdat&quot;.

<doc id="951124" wikidata="Q924817" url="?curid=951124" title="Auric Goldfinger">
<text>Auric Goldfinger is a fictional character and the main antagonist in Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1959 seventh &quot;James Bond&quot; novel, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, and the 1964 film it inspired (the third in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series). His first name, Auric, is an adjective meaning &quot;of gold&quot;. Fleming chose the name to commemorate the architect Ernő Goldfinger, who had built his home in Hampstead next door to Fleming&#x27;s; he disliked Goldfinger&#x27;s style of architecture and destruction of Victorian terraces and decided to name a memorable villain after him. According to a 1965 &quot;Forbes&quot; article and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Goldfinger persona was based on gold-mining magnate Charles W. Engelhard, Jr.

In 2003, the American Film Institute declared Auric Goldfinger the 49th-greatest villain in the past 100 years of film. In a poll on IMDb, Auric Goldfinger was voted the most sinister James Bond villain, beating (in order) Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Dr. No, Max Zorin and Emilio Largo. Goldfinger&#x27;s oft-quoted line &quot;No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die,&quot; (after Bond asked him while tied to a table in front of a laser, &quot;Do you expect me to talk?&quot;) was voted the number-one best moment in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film franchise in a 2013 Sky Movies poll.

Auric Goldfinger was played by German actor Gert Fröbe. Fröbe, who did not speak English well, was dubbed in the film by Michael Collins, an English actor. In the German version, Fröbe dubbed himself back again.

&quot;Goldfinger&quot; was banned in Israel after it was revealed that Fröbe had been a member of the Nazi Party. However, he left the party before the outbreak of World War II. After several years, the ban was lifted, as it was found that Fröbe likely saved the lives of two Jews by hiding them in his basement during the war.

==Novel biography==
In the novel, Auric Goldfinger is a 42-year-old from Riga, Latvia, who emigrated to Britain in 1937 at the age of 20. He is tall, has blue eyes, red hair, and a passion for his tan.

Goldfinger&#x27;s name was borrowed from Ian Fleming&#x27;s neighbour in his Hampstead home, architect Ernő Goldfinger, and his character bears some resemblance. Ernő Goldfinger consulted his lawyers when the book was published, prompting Fleming to suggest renaming the character &quot;Goldprick&quot;, but Goldfinger eventually settled out of court in return for his legal costs, six copies of the novel, and an agreement that the character&#x27;s first name &#x27;Auric&#x27; would always be used. Goldfinger is typically a German-Jewish name, and the protagonists of the novel know this, but neither Bond nor Mr. Du Pont think Goldfinger is Jewish. Instead, Bond thinks the red-haired, blue-eyed man to be a Balt, being proved correct when Goldfinger is revealed to be a Latvian émigré.

Following naturalisation as a British citizen in Nassau, in the Bahamas, Goldfinger has become the richest man in England, although his wealth is not in English banks, nor does he pay taxes on it, as it is spread as gold bullion in many countries. Goldfinger is the treasurer of SMERSH, a Soviet counterintelligence agency, which is Bond&#x27;s nemesis. Goldfinger fancies himself an expert pistol shot who never misses, and always shoots his opponents through the right eye. He tells Bond at the end of the novel he has done so with four Mafia heads.

Goldfinger is obsessed with gold, going so far as to keep a yellow-bound copy of an erotic novel in his nightstand and have his lovers painted head to toe in gold so that he can make love to gold. (He leaves an area near the spine unpainted, but painting this area also is what kills Jill Masterton, as in the film.) He is also a jeweller, a metallurgist, and a smuggler.

When Goldfinger first meets Bond in Miami, he claims that he is agoraphobic; a ploy to allow him to cheat Junius du Pont, a previous acquaintance of Bond&#x27;s (from &quot;Casino Royale&quot;), at a game of two-handed Canasta. Bond figures out how Goldfinger is managing this and blackmails him by forcing him to admit his deception. This incident also establishes Goldfinger as boundlessly greedy, as whatever sums he can gain by this elaborate cheating are negligible compared with what he already has in his possession.

Goldfinger is also an avid golfer, but is known at his club for being a smooth cheater there, also. When Bond contrives to play against Goldfinger with $10,000 at stake, he out-cheats Goldfinger by switching the latter&#x27;s Dunlop 1 golf ball with a Dunlop 7 he had found while playing. Goldfinger loses the final hole and the match for playing a ball that does not belong to him.

In both the novel and film, Goldfinger is aided in his crimes by his manservant Oddjob, a monstrously strong Korean who ruthlessly eliminates any threat to his employer&#x27;s affairs.

Goldfinger is the owner of &quot;Enterprises Auric A.G.&quot; in Switzerland, maker of metal furniture which is purchased by many airlines, including Air India. Twice a year, Goldfinger drives his vintage Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost car from England to Enterprises Auric. Bond learns that Goldfinger makes dead drops of gold bars for SMERSH along the way, and that his car&#x27;s bodywork is 18-carat (75%), solid white gold under the ploy that the added weight is armour plating. Once at Enterprises Auric, the bodywork is stripped off, melted and made into airplane seats for a company that Enterprises Auric is heavily invested in. The plane(s) are then flown to India where the seats are melted down again into gold bars and sold for a much higher rate—100 to 200 per cent profit.

===Operation Grand Slam===

In the novel, Goldfinger captures Bond and threatens to cut him in half with a circular saw as Oddjob tortures him using his pressure points. Bond offers to work for Goldfinger in exchange for his life, but Goldfinger refuses to spare him, and he blacks out.

Bond wakes to find that Goldfinger is going to take him up on his offer after all, and makes him his prisoner and secretary. While working at this job, Bond discovers that Goldfinger is plotting to rob the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in an action codenamed &quot;Operation Grand Slam&quot;.

Goldfinger plans to contaminate the water supply at Fort Knox using the nerve agent GB (also known as Sarin), killing everyone at the base. Then, using an atomic bomb designed for an MGM-5 Corporal intermediate-range ballistic missile that he had purchased for US$1 million in Germany, Goldfinger would blow open Fort Knox&#x27;s impregnable vault, before removing roughly $15 billion in gold bullion by truck and train with the help of American criminal organizations, including the Mafia, the Purple Gang (an organization that existed in real life), the Spangled Mob (a fictional gang featured in the earlier Bond novel &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;), and the Cement Mixers, an all-female gang led by lesbian and former trapeze artist Pussy Galore. They would then escape to the Soviet Union on a cargo boat. Goldfinger bribes the syndicate leaders with $15,000 in gold apiece to secure their attendance at the meeting and promises that each group will receive at least $1 billion, while he will keep $5 billion. In addition, Goldfinger has promised Bond £1 million in gold once the theft is complete.

Bond foils Goldfinger&#x27;s plan by writing a note to his American colleague Felix Leiter, containing the details of the impending operation, and taping it to the underside of an airplane toilet seat. Once the note reaches Leiter, he arranges for help from the FBI and the Pentagon. Leiter is able to foil the theft, but Goldfinger escapes.

Later, Goldfinger and his henchmen learn from SMERSH who Bond is and determine to take him with them in defecting to the Soviet Union. They pose as doctors to incapacitate crew and passengers (including Bond) with drugged inoculations. Then they hijack the aircraft and load Goldfinger&#x27;s three-ton personal bullion hoard onto it. The hijacked airplane is piloted by three German ex-Luftwaffe pilots who work for Goldfinger. Oddjob meets his end when he is sucked through an airliner window after Bond pierces it with a knife. Bond and Goldfinger engage in a brief struggle, during which Bond is seized by a violent rage for the first time in his life, strangling Goldfinger to death with his bare hands. Bond then turns to the pilots and forces the airplane to turn back from its intended flight path, causing it to ditch in the ocean after running out of fuel. The weight of Goldfinger&#x27;s gold causes the airplane to sink rapidly, taking his body and his pilots down with it. Only Bond and Pussy Galore, both wearing lifejackets, appear in the ocean and are soon picked up, as the only survivors.

====Criticism of novel&#x27;s plan and changes made in filmed version====
After publication of the novel, the details of &quot;Operation Grand Slam&quot; were questioned, with critics noting it would have taken hours, if not days, to remove $15 billion from Fort Knox, during which the U.S. Army would have inevitably intervened. The issue of getting every soldier on the base to drink the poisoned water without an alarm was also raised. A final problem was the &quot;clean&quot; atomic bomb, tactical or not, which in all likelihood would have annihilated the vault instead of breaking it open. The novel itself has a scene where Bond points out to Goldfinger several reasons why the plan could not possibly work, and Goldfinger responds only with a vague assurance that he has prepared solutions for these problems.

Consequently, the filmed version of the novel altered the details of the plan. Although Bond initially believes that Goldfinger intends to steal the bullion, he soon realizes that the true plan is to set off a Chinese-supplied dirty bomb within the vault. The explosion will irradiate the gold and render it unusable for decades, crippling the gold standard–based economy and greatly increasing the value of Goldfinger&#x27;s personal bullion holdings. During this conversation, Bond points out the logistical flaws in the theft as set out in the original novel.

==Film biography==

In the film, Goldfinger is a successful businessman, owning many properties throughout the world, including &quot;Auric Enterprises, AG&quot; in Switzerland and a stud-farm in Kentucky called &quot;Auric Stud&quot;. However, Goldfinger&#x27;s real business is that of internationally smuggling gold, using the method of having a car (precisely, a Rolls-Royce Phantom III) built with gold body castings and transporting it via airplane before having the bodywork re-smelted once it arrives at its destination. After Goldfinger&#x27;s business affairs come under suspicion from the Bank of England, Bond is sent to investigate.

In the film, Felix Leiter says that Goldfinger is &quot;British, but he doesn&#x27;t sound like it&quot;; however, this may simply mean he possesses British citizenship, as by his accent and red-blond hair he is probably German by birth. Fröbe was chosen to play the villain because producers Saltzman and Broccoli had seen his performance in a German thriller titled &quot;Es geschah am helllichten Tag&quot; (&quot;It happened in broad daylight&quot;, 1958), based on the story &quot;Das Versprechen&quot; (&quot;The Pledge&quot;) by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. In that film, Fröbe played a serial killer named Schrott, who kills children to vent his frustrations with his domineering wife. Broccoli and Saltzman had seen the movie and decided upon the &quot;big bad German&quot; for the role.

In the film, Goldfinger, an avid golfer, reveals a fascination with Nazi gold when Bond tempts him to bet £5,000 against a lost, historical Nazi gold bar, an incident not in the novel (the golf game is played for $10,000). Goldfinger cheats with help from Oddjob, but Bond figures out the deception and tricks him into playing the wrong ball on the last hole, costing him the match. Goldfinger is shown to take sadistic pleasure in killing his enemies, which he accomplishes in elaborate ways. This is shown when he attempts to kill a captured Bond by slowly cutting him in half with a laser (but is talked out of it by Bond) and, later, when he uses nerve gas to execute a group of gangsters he had invited to his ranch.

Initially Goldfinger makes it appear that his plan is to rob Fort Knox, but when Bond reveals to Goldfinger that this is impossible because it would take 2 weeks, 200 trucks and 60 men to steal the gold before the authorities find out and force him to return the gold, when Goldfinger denies planning to steal the gold, Bond begins to connect the dots and concludes that Goldfinger&#x27;s real plan is to detonate a small dirty bomb (helped by Mr. Ling, a Communist Chinese nuclear fission specialist) within the gold bullion depository at Fort Knox. The explosion will render the gold radioactive and unusable for 58 years, increasing the value of his own gold and giving the Chinese an advantage resulting from the ensuing economic chaos. Bond, at this point held captive by Goldfinger, is able to smuggle the details of the operation out to his CIA associate Felix Leiter and, taken along on the operation by Goldfinger, ultimately thwarts the operation by defusing the atomic device.

With Fort Knox safe, Bond is invited to the White House for a meeting with the President. However, with his pilot Pussy Galore, Goldfinger hijacks the plane carrying Bond. In a struggle for Goldfinger&#x27;s revolver, Bond shoots out a window, causing an explosive decompression. Goldfinger is sucked out of the cabin through the window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore before parachuting to safety with her from the aircraft.

<text>Charters Towers is a rural town in the Charters Towers Region, Queensland, Australia. It is by road south-west from Townsville on the Flinders Highway. During the last quarter of the 19th century, the town boomed as the rich gold deposits under the city were developed. After becoming uneconomical in the 20th century, profitable mining operations have commenced once again. In the , the town of Charters Towers had a population of 8,040 people.

== Geography ==
The urban area of the town of Charters Towers includes its suburbs: Charters Towers City (the centre of the city); Richmond Hill, Toll, and Columbia to the north, Queenton to the east, Grand Secret and Alabama Hill to the west, and Towers Hill, Mosman Park, and Millchester to the south.

Charters Towers township is only mildly elevated at above sea-level, but this has a noticeable effect, with lower humidity and wider temperature variations compared to nearby Townsville. Charters Towers obtains its water supply from the nearby Burdekin River.

== Climate ==
Charters Towers experiences a tropical semi-arid climate (Koppen: BSh), with a short wet season from November to March and a long dry season from April to October, with cooler nights and lower humidity. The average annual rainfall is , primarily concentrated in the austral summer. Extreme temperatures in Charters Towers have ranged from on 6 January 1994 to on 5 July 1899.

Record temperatures were combined from the old Post Office weather station (1893-1992) and the current Airport weather station (1992-2024).

==History==

The town was founded in the 1870s when gold was discovered by chance at Towers Hill on Christmas Eve 1871 by 12-year-old Aboriginal boy, Jupiter Mosman. Jupiter was with a small group of prospectors including Hugh Mosman, James Fraser, and George Clarke. Their horses bolted after a flash of lightning. While he was searching, Jupiter found both the horses and a nugget of gold in a creek at the base of Towers Hill. Charters originated from the Gold Commissioner, WSEM Charters. Ten major gold reefs were eventually mined.
Such were the boom years, between 1872 and 1899, that Charters Towers hosted its own stock exchange. The Great Northern Railway between Charters Towers and the coastal port of Townsville was completed in December 1882. During this period, the population was 27,500, making Charters Towers Queensland&#x27;s largest city outside of Brisbane. The city was also affectionately known as &quot;The World&quot;, as anything one might desire reportedly could be had in the Towers, leaving no reason to travel elsewhere.

The Borough of Charters Towers was proclaimed on 21 June 1877 under the &quot;Municipal Institutions Act 1864&quot; with John McDonald being elected the town&#x27;s first mayor. The local government area would later be known as Town of Charters Towers and City of Charters Towers, before being absorbed into the Charters Towers Region.

Charters Towers Post Office opened on 17 May 1872.

A 20 head of stamps mill began ore-crushing operations on 16 July 1872. The Venus Battery continued to be used by small mine in the region until 1971. The unique site remains intact today, together with a cyanide treatment plant and assay office.

On Sunday 10 August 1884, the new Charters Towers District Hospital opened. During 1888–89, the Charters Towers Stock Exchange and Royal Arcade were constructed at the northern end of Gill Street for local businessman and civic leader Alexander Malcolm.

By 1917, gold mining became uneconomical. During World War I, labour was hard to find, and as the mines drove deeper, ventilation and water problems arose. This production decline was similar across Australian gold mines, with rising costs and a fixed gold price eroding profitability. The town entered a long period of relative stagnation and little further development has occurred since.

The Charters Towers gold field produced over 200 tonnes (6.6 million troy ounces) of gold from 1871 to 1917. The gold is concentrated into veins, and was Australia&#x27;s richest major field with an average grade of 34 grams per tonne. The grade was almost double that of Victorian mines and almost 75% higher than the grades of Western Australian (Kalgoorlie) gold fields of that time.

In 1935, Clermont-Charters Towers was an important line for public telephone communications.

During World War II, Charters Towers was the location of RAAF No.9 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 29 August 1944. Usually consisting of four tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).
Beginning in June 1943, Charters Towers was also the location for a major USAAF chemical bomb depot operated by the 760th Chemical Depot Company (Aviation). The depot contained bombs filled with mustard agent, cyanogen chloride and other toxic chemicals. In addition to maintaining the depot, the 760th cooperated with the Australian Chemical Warfare Research Unit to conduct research on bomb design and delivery techniques. Late in 1944, the depot and its contents were moved to Oro Bay, New Guinea.

== Economy ==
Charters Towers is a regional centre for the mining industry, the beef industry, and education, specifically boarding schools catering for remote rural families.

===Mining===
More gold has been estimated to exist underground than the total removed in the gold rush. Hundreds of separate mining leases covering an area of were consolidated by James Lynch in the 1970s and 1980s and the company Citigold listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 1993. After 89 years, the goldfields were reopened, and gold was produced again from the Warrior Mine southeast of the town in November 2006 by Citigold Corporation Limited. Gold is mined from two deposits, which are accessed by sloping tunnels. The extracted gold ore is trucked about south-west of the city for processing into gold Doré bars. Citigold has announced plans to open three mines directly under the city to extract gold at a rate of 250,000 ounces per year.

===Education===
Charters Towers has four secondary schools: Columba Catholic College (opened in 1998); Blackheath and Thornburgh College (opened in 1919); All Souls St Gabriels School (opened in 1920); and Charters Towers State High School (opened in 1912). The nearest university is the James Cook University, in Townsville. Charters Towers is well known as a boarding school town, with families from western Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and the Torres Strait Islands sending their children to school in the district, over the larger cities in the area such as Townsville and Cairns. The Alliance of Charters Towers State Schools (ACTSS) represents the five State schools in the area that are funded by the Queensland Government – Charters Towers Central State School (opened in 1875), Millchester State School (opened in 1874), Richmond Hill State School (opened in 1895), Charters Towers School of Distance Education (opened in 1987) and Charters Towers State High School.

A number of other state schools within the city and nearby vicinity, which mostly commenced during the mining boom years, have also existed. These included Queenton State School (1890–1933), Mt. Leyshon State School (1890 – &quot;circa&quot; 1940), King&#x27;s Gully State School (1911–1932), the Broughton State School (1905–?), Macrossan State School (1884–19??), Rishton State School (1884–1891), Liontown State School (1905 – &quot;circa&quot; 1921), Black Jack State School (1887–1948), Pumping Station State School (1898–1936), and Sellheim State School (1889–1939).

== Amenities ==
The Charters Towers Regional Council operates the Charters Towers Excelsior Library in Charters Towers at 130 Gill Street.

The Charters Towers branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association meets at the Jane Black Memorial Hall at 80 Mossman Street. Jane Black of Pajingo Station was a pioneer of the Charters Towers branch but also one of the founders of the Country Women&#x27;s Association in Queensland as a whole. The hall was officially opened on Thursday 22 July 1954.

==Media and communications==
===Print===
&quot;The Northern Miner&quot; newspaper (not to be confused with &quot;The Northern Miner&quot;, a mining publication in Canada) was first published in August 1872, just eight months after the discovery of gold. Such was its strength in those gold-mining days of the late 1880s that &quot;The Northern Miner&quot; installed a then-revolutionary linotype slug-casting machine before Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;The Courier Mail&quot;. It was the only newspaper (of five published during the boom gold years) that survives today. In 2000, &quot;The Northern Miner&quot; was linked for the first time to the North Queensland Newspaper Company and therefore News Limited&#x27;s electronic layout system and website.

&quot;The Evening Telegraph&quot; was a daily newspaper published between 1901 and 1921.

Sumpton&#x27;s Gold Rush Gazette is a local newspaper which has been printed weekly since April 2021. The publication&#x27;s founder, Daniel Sumpton, has been referred to as &quot;The man who brought Print Journalism back to Charters Towers.&quot;

===Online===
The Charters Towers E-Village launched in 2011 and provides a location where people can connect with the Charters Towers community. The E-Village is the creation of local resident, Bryan West, following his frustration at not being able to find a suitable date for a kindergarten working bee. It includes a community calendar, member pages for all Charters Towers organisations, a database of services available within and to the community, classifieds, daily weather, and an online shop. It has a daily news service that originates and aggregates content from and relevant to the Charters Towers community, which is delivered through a Facebook page and free daily newsletter. Because it has a lower than national proportion of households with reliable internet access, the Charters Towers E-Village installed a free public wireless internet service in the main street of the town, in conjunction with local businesses. Since its inception in 2011, it has grown to receive about 1,500 visits each day. The E-village derives its income from related web services, with any profits being returned to the Charters Towers community.

===Radio===
Charters Towers is served by two local commercial radio stations, 4GC and West FM (originally branded as Hot FM), both owned by Resonate Broadcasting. Both stations rely heavily on networked programming but 4GC, broadcasting on 828 AM, produces a local breakfast program between 6am and 9am each weekday and provides local news bulletins and weather updates. Along with 3GG in Warragul, Victoria, Resonate Broadcasting bought the Charters Towers stations from Macquarie Media Group in 2008, with the three stations becoming the company&#x27;s first investments.

The Bull FM88 is the only country music radio station in Charters Towers playing an extensive mix from the 1980s to today. It is a low-powered open narrowcast (LPON) service broadcasting on 88.0 FM, which began in 2018. It is owned and operated by Margflow Media.

===Television===
In 2021, Charters Towers was confirmed to have been selected as the location for the ninth season of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;, a &quot;Survivor: Blood vs Water&quot; series scheduled to air on Network 10 in 2022.

==The Goldfield Ashes==
The Charters Towers Goldfield Ashes has been an amateur cricket carnival conducted over the Australia Day long weekend in January since 1948 by the Charters Towers Cricket Association Incorporated (CTCA), and it is now the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. Players ranging from regional and the country to play. Numbers in recent years have reached just shy of 200 teams. The event is of massive benefit for the town, bringing in business for the entire region, especially the town&#x27;s pubs and clubs. While the higher grades take it very seriously with awards and prizes given, the lower grades take to a more social view. Games involving drinking penalties and costume wearing are all part of the antics. In 2010, more teams were involved than ever. However, the competition did not reach the magic 200 teams only because of the lack of fields in the region. Many of the fields are concrete pitches on the properties of local families in the region.

<doc id="951127" wikidata="Q5487325" url="?curid=951127" title="Frank Horton (New York politician)">
<text>Frank Jefferson Horton (December 12, 1919 – August 30, 2004) was a United States representative from New York State.

==Early life and career==
Horton was born in Cuero, Texas and was a graduate of Louisiana State University (B.A., 1941) where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity (&quot;Gamma&quot; chapter). He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941 and served until the end of World War II. He then attended Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York and received a Bachelor of Laws in 1947, the same year that he was admitted to the New York Bar. From 1956 to 1962 he was the President of Rochester Community Baseball, Inc. From 1959 to 1961, Horton served as the Executive Vice President of the International Baseball League, as well as the League&#x27;s attorney.

==Political career==
Horton was a member of the Rochester City Council from 1955 to 1961. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1962 as a Republican, Horton was re-elected to 14 additional terms.

In 1966, along with three Republican Senators and four other Republican Representatives, Horton signed a telegram sent to Georgia Governor Carl E. Sanders regarding the Georgia legislature&#x27;s refusal to seat the recently elected Julian Bond in their state House of Representatives. This refusal, said the telegram, was &quot;a dangerous attack on representative government. None of us agree with Mr. Bond&#x27;s views on the Vietnam War; in fact we strongly repudiate these views. But unless otherwise determined by a court of law, which the Georgia Legislature is not, he is entitled to express them.&quot;

Horton was known as a moderate, a Rockefeller Republican and &quot;the least partisan of Representatives.&quot; He rose to the position of Ranking Minority Member of the Government Operations Committee (now known as the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.)

Horton retired from Congress in 1993 when redistricting placed him in the same district as his friend Rep. Louise Slaughter.

While in Congress, Horton proposed making the United States Environmental Protection Agency a cabinet-level agency and helped introduce the Whistleblower Protection Act in 1987. Horton also introduced legislation which designated the month of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.

<doc id="951128" wikidata="Q1892155" url="?curid=951128" title="St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne">
<text>St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in Melbourne, Australia. It is the cathedral church of the Diocese of Melbourne and the seat of the Archbishop of Melbourne, who is also the metropolitan archbishop of the Province of Victoria.

The cathedral was designed by the English Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield and completed in 1891, except for the spires which were built to a different design from 1926 to 1932. It is one of Melbourne&#x27;s major architectural landmarks.

== Location ==
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is in a prominent location at the centre of Melbourne, on the eastern corner of Swanston and Flinders streets. It is situated diagonally opposite Flinders Street station, which was the hub of 19th-century Melbourne and remains an important transport centre.

Immediately to the south of the cathedral, across Flinders Street, is the new public heart of Melbourne, Federation Square. Continuing south down Swanston Street is Princes Bridge, which crosses the Yarra River, leading to St Kilda Road. Thus the cathedral has a dominating position from the southern approaches to the city.

The location for the cathedral marks the place of the first Christian service held in Melbourne in 1835. Previous buildings on this site include a corn market and St Paul&#x27;s Parish Church.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is built on the site where the first public Christian service in Melbourne was conducted in 1835. The block was then a government reserve far from the centre of town to the west, and used as a corn market. By 1848 the site was then adjacent to the first Princes Bridge across the Yarra River, and the prominent site was granted to the Anglican Church. The bluestone Church of St Paul the Apostle was consecrated in 1852.

Colonial artist Samuel Thomas Gill sketched St Paul&#x27;s Church in 1854. A lithographic print titled &#x27;St. Paul&#x27;s Church Melbourne 1854&#x27; is part of his &quot;Sketches in Victoria&quot; album and was digitised by the National Library of Australia in 2021.

Nearly 30 years later with the huge growth of the city and Swanston Street becoming a major thoroughfare, the diocese decided to build a grand cathedral on the site to supersede the 1839 St James Old Cathedral located in the western end of the CBD. The English architect William Butterfield, known for his distinctive interpretation of the Gothic Revival, was commissioned to design the new cathedral. To fit the block, the cathedral is orientated in line with the central city grid, on the north-south axis, rather than facing east, the traditional direction. The foundation stone was laid in 1880 by the Governor of Victoria, John, Earl of Hopetoun (&quot;later&quot; Marquess of Linlithgow), in the presence of the Rt Revd Charles Perry, Bishop of Melbourne. On 22 January 1891 the cathedral (without the spires) was consecrated by the Rt Revd Field Flowers Goe, Bishop of Melbourne.

The building work was marked by disputes between Butterfield and the church authorities in Melbourne, leading to Butterfield&#x27;s resignation in 1884. The job was then awarded to a local architect, Joseph Reed, who completed the building generally faithfully to Butterfield&#x27;s design and who also designed the attached chapter house in matching style in 1889. 

The pipe organ was commissioned from the English builder T. C. Lewis, one of the most prominent organ builders of the 19th century.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
For nearly 40 years, without the spires, the cathedral presented as a rather solid, horizontal mass, but was nevertheless the subject of postcards and photographs. In the early 1920s, having determined not to complete Butterfield&#x27;s design, it was decided to hold a competition for the design of new spires. The winner, announced in Feb 1925, was John Barr, of Sydney, with a traditional Gothic Revival style, and the central spire much taller than the original design. Construction started in July 1926, using a stone from the Sydney area that was different to the original Barabool stone. The central tower was named the Moorhouse Spire, and reached its full height of 312 ft (95m) in 1932, and on 30 April 1933 a service of thanksgiving was held for its completion. The tower of St Paul&#x27;s became the tallest structure in central Melbourne and dominated the city&#x27;s skyline when viewed from the south.

While the towers were underway, additions were made to the Chapter House, enlarging the two storey section facing Flinders Street by one bay and one floor, in exactly matching stonework. The architects were Gawler &amp; Drummond, and the works were done in 1926.

The 1960s saw extensive work completed to the exterior of the cathedral and in 1989 the organ was restored with the help of a major National Trust appeal. Further major restoration works were completed in 2009 with significant repairs to the spires, the installation of a coloured glass lantern in the Moorhouse Tower and coloured glass doors and a glass walled airlock at the Great West door.

The growth of multi-storey buildings in central Melbourne during the later 20th century robbed St Paul&#x27;s of its claims to height, but with the retail heart height limit of 40m, it has retained its dominance of the immediate area. For about 30 years it was however somewhat dominated by the 16-storey Gas &amp; Fuel buildings built along Flinders Street to the east in 1967, but demolished in 1997 to make way for Federation Square.

By the 1990s the constant traffic vibration in central Melbourne led to concerns about the structural soundness of the cathedral, particularly its spires. A public appeal, led by the then Dean of Melbourne, David Richardson, raised A$18 million to restore the spires and improve the interior of the building. The seven-year restoration project was completed in 2009, under the guidance of Falkinger Andronas Architects and Heritage Consultants (now Andronas Conservation Architecture). The restoration works were undertaken by Cathedral Stone and were acknowledged by the Australian Institute of Architects, the Victorian Chapter Heritage Architecture Award 2009 and the Lachlan Macquarie National Award for Heritage Architecture 2009.

As part of the work, stone heads of former dean David Richardson and philanthropist Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, created by Melbourne sculptor Smiley Williams and carved by stonemason Daryl Gilbert, were added to the spires and new &quot;dalle de verre&quot; glass was created by Janusz and Magda Kuszbicki for the west doors and the &quot;Eighth Day&quot; lantern in the Moorhouse Tower.

Besides Sunday and weekday Eucharists the cathedral &quot;maintains the English tradition&quot; of a daily choral Evensong, being the only Australian Anglican cathedral to do so.

== Architecture ==
The plan of St Paul&#x27;s is a traditional Latin cross, with a long nave, side aisles, short transepts, a tower at the crossing, with choir below, sanctuary and altar beyond, and a pair of towers framing the ceremonial main entrance.

The stonework is a mixture of sandstone from the Barrabool Hills and Waurn Ponds limestone, giving the cathedral a warm colouring, when most other grand 19th century public buildings are faced in lighter sandstone imported from other states. It is also quite different in appearance to the bluestone Gothic of St Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic cathedral on the eastern hill of the city. Because the spires are built from Sydney sandstone and are 40 years newer, they are a different and darker colour than the older parts of the building.

The interior features rich colours and strident colour contrasts, characteristic of Butterfield&#x27;s work, compared to the exterior. All the stonework is constructed of the Waurn Ponds limestone with contrasting stripes of the very dark-coloured local bluestone. The dado, floor, high altar and reredos are outstanding examples of High Victorian Gothic polychromy. The reredos is made from Devonshire marble, alabaster and glittering Venetian glass mosaics. One of the carved figures on the pulpit is said to be the image of a former Mayor of Melbourne&#x27;s daughter who died in infancy. The floor is entirely paved with encaustic tile imported from the English firm of Maw &amp; Co., featuring both patterned layouts and patterns within the tiles, while the dado is created with patterned glazed tiles.

In Persian tile on the rear wall of the narthex is a replica of an 8-pointed star found in two churches of the Anglican Diocese of Iran, the church of St Simon the Zealot in Shiraz and St Luke&#x27;s Church in Isfahan. There are two baptismal fonts. The round font of Harcourt granite was installed when the cathedral was first built. In 1912 the immersion font was built in memory of Field Flowers Goe, third Bishop of Melbourne.

== Music ==
Music plays an integral part of worship at St Paul&#x27;s, and the repertoire of Anglican church music can be heard during services. Music at the cathedral is the responsibility of the director of music and the music foundation, established in 1993, provides funding for the musical life of the cathedral.

=== Director of music ===

The director of music at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, until the appointment of Philip Nicholls in 2013, was also the organist.
* Ernest Wood, 1888–1914
* A. E. Floyd, 1914–1947
* C. C. Campbell Ross, 1947–1951
* Lance Hardy, 1951–1973
* June Nixon , 1973–2013
* Philip Nicholls, 2013–present

A former director of music and organist, June Nixon, was awarded a Lambeth doctorate (DMus) by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1999. This recognised her long contribution to choral and organ music and marks the first woman to be so honoured.

=== Organ ===
The cathedral&#x27;s pipe organ was built by T. C. Lewis and Co of Brixton, England. Over six and half thousand pounds were spent on its construction, shipping and installation before it was played at the cathedral&#x27;s inaugural service in 1891. Various modifications and maintenance works have been carried out since then, culminating in an A$726,000 restoration which was completed in 1990 with the help of a National Trust appeal. In its restored state the organ has four manuals and pedals with 53 stops, all with electro-pneumatic action, and is housed in the cathedral&#x27;s south transept behind newly stencilled façade pipes.

=== Choir ===

Originally formed in 1888 in conjunction with the choir of All Saints&#x27; St Kilda, the cathedral choir led the procession for the official opening in 1891. The choir sings at Evensong throughout the week and for two of the four Sunday services. The choir is also called upon for special occasions including chapter Evensongs, synod services, state funerals, concerts, carol services and seasonal services.

Since the early 1990s the choir cassocks are of a deep burgundy colour, matching the stencil design hue on the organ pipes. Originally the choir wore traditional black cassocks and white surplices, but with the introduction of &quot;An Australian Prayer Book&quot; in the late 1970s, new cassocks of a green colour approximating that of the new prayer book cover (and coincidentally, that of the visible organ pipework at the time) were introduced and surplices were discontinued. On a visit to the cathedral in 1985 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, a somewhat astonished Robert Runcie exclaimed that he had &quot;never seen a cathedral choir wearing &quot;green&quot; robes before&quot;. With the restoration of the organ in the early 1990s, surplices were restored and cassocks of a deep burgundy were introduced matching the new stencil design hue on the organ pipes.

Unique to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is the boys choir role of &quot;Dean&#x27;s Chorister&quot; created by David Richardson when Dean of Melbourne. The Dean&#x27;s Chorister primarily has the role of leading the choir with the &quot;virge&quot; or ceremonial mace, a task formerly performed by the head chorister.

In 2016, the 125th anniversary of the cathedral&#x27;s consecration, the Girls&#x27; Voices of the Cathedral Choir were established and female lay clerks were also permitted to join the choir. The Girls&#x27; and Boys&#x27; Voices now sing the same number of services per week, and take an equal share in the musical life of the cathedral.

=== Belfry ===
St Paul&#x27;s has a ring of 12 bells set for change ringing in the key of C♯, with an extra bell to allow different subsets of the full number to be rung still to a diatonic scale. All 13 bells were cast by Mears &amp; Stainbank of Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1889. The tenor originally weighed 31cwt but after the whole set was sent to Taylor&#x27;s Bell Foundry in 1963 for retuning it now weighs 29cwt.

The bells were a gift from Thomas Dyer Edwardes and were dedicated and first rung on 15 November 1889 for the departure of the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Loch (&quot;later&quot; Baron Loch). The St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Society of Bellringers was founded in 1896 and are affiliated with the Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers.

== Significant occasions ==
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral has hosted many significant occasions in national, Commonwealth and international history. St Paul&#x27;s continues to be the choice venue for many state funerals and has played host to those of many prime ministers, premiers, governors, governors-general and other significant people.

=== Papal visit ===
On 28 November 1986, on his arrival in Melbourne, Pope John Paul II paid a visit to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in recognition of the dialogue between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in Melbourne fostered by their respective former archbishops, the Most Reverend Sir Frank Woods (Anglican) and the Most Reverend Sir Frank Little (Roman Catholic).

The cathedral choir sang &quot;Ecce vicit Leo&quot; as the Pope entered the cathedral. After this the Pope prayed for Christian unity and lit a metre-long candle. A memorial chapel (pictured right) commemorates this historic occasion: only the third time in four centuries when a reigning Pope had made an official visit to an Anglican cathedral.

=== Christmas carol service recording ===
On 28 November 2007, a carol service called &quot;Carols from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Melbourne&quot; featuring the choir was recorded by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and broadcast Australia-wide on Christmas Eve.

<doc id="951133" wikidata="Q836108" url="?curid=951133" title="Baths of Diocletian">
<text>The Baths of Diocletian (Latin: &quot;Thermae Diocletiani&quot;, Italian: &quot;Terme di Diocleziano&quot;) were public baths in ancient Rome. Named after emperor Diocletian and built from AD 298 to 306, they were the largest of the imperial baths. The project was originally commissioned by Maximian upon his return to Rome in the autumn of 298 and was continued after his and Diocletian&#x27;s abdication under Constantius, father of Constantine.

The baths were open until c. 537, when the Ostrogoths cut off aqueducts to the city of Rome. The site houses the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, built within the ruins in the 16th century, the Church of San Bernardo alle Terme, and part of the National Roman Museum.

== Location ==
The baths occupy the high ground on the northeast summit of the Viminal, the smallest of the Seven hills of Rome, just inside the Agger of the Servian Wall (near what are today the Piazza della Repubblica and Termini rail station). They served as baths for the people residing in the Viminal, Quirinal, and Esquiline quarters of the city. The &quot;Quadrigae Pisonis&quot;, a 2nd-century monument with various reliefs, some private homes, and a relief representing the temple of Quirinus once stood at the site but were demolished to build the baths. The water supply was provided by the Aqua Marcia, an aqueduct that had long served the city of Rome since the early 2nd century. To properly supply the baths, the supply of water to the city was increased under the order of Diocletian. The baths may have also been supplied by the Aqua Antoniniana, which was originally positioned to supply Caracalla&#x27;s baths in the early 3rd century.

== History ==
The baths were commissioned by Maximian in honour of co-emperor Diocletian in AD 298, the same year he returned from Africa. Evidence of this can be found in bricks from the main area of the baths, which distinctly show stamps of the Diocletianic period. This evidence shows the effect of the massive project on the brick industry in that all work by them was redirected and under the control of the emperor. Building took place between the year it was first commissioned and sometime between the abdication of Diocletian in 305 and the death of Constantius in July 306.

In the early 5th century, the baths were restored. The baths remained in use until the siege of Rome in 537 when the Ostrogothic king Vitiges cut off the aqueducts.

According to the medieval guidebook &quot;Mirabilia Urbis Romae&quot;, the baths were then known as &quot;Palatium Diocletiani&quot;. 

In the 1560s, Pope Pius IV ordered the building of a basilica in some of the remains, to commemorate Christian martyrs who according to legend died during the baths&#x27; construction, &quot;Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri&quot;. To this was attached a Carthusian charterhouse. Michelangelo was commissioned to design the church and he made use of both the &quot;frigidarium&quot; and &quot;tepidarium&quot; structures. He also planned the main cloister of the charterhouse. A small cloister next to the presbytery of the church was built, occupying part of the area where the baths&#x27; &quot;natatio&quot; had been located. After 1575, starting under Pope Gregory XIII, several remaining halls of the baths were converted into grain and oil stores for the city of Rome.

After Rome became part of the Kingdom of Italy, its seat of government was moved to the city. In 1884, the Carthusians abandoned the charterhouse and the area around the baths was subject to substantial changes. Roma Termini station was built, the Ministry of the Economy moved to the area, and the Grand Hotel and Palazzo Massimo were constructed. Gaetano Koch designed the palazzi fronting Piazza dell&#x27;Esedra (now Piazza della Repubblica), destroying part of the original exedra. Via Cernaia cut off the western gymnasium from the remains of the enclosure wall (the latter are now in Via Parigi). In 1889, the Italian government set up the Museo Nazionale Romano in the baths and in the charterhouse.

=== Moses Jacob Ezekiel studio ===
Moses Jacob Ezekiel (October 28, 1844 – March 27, 1917) was an American sculptor who established an artist&#x27;s studio in the Baths of Diocletian — where he lived and worked from 1879 to 1910, selling his works internationally including as commissions in the United States. 
Ezekiel&#x27;s studio was regarded as &quot;one of the Show Places of the Eternal City, magnificent in proportions and stored with fine artworks.&quot; He held an open house there every Friday afternoon, in addition to hosting musicales, where could be heard &quot;the finest music by the greatest talent&quot;. Visitors to his studio included:

* Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio
* Queen of Italy Margherita of Savoy
* General and future US President Ulysses Grant
* Franz Liszt 
* Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany

After 30 years, the government &quot;demand[ed] the possession of this part of the ruins as an adjunct to the National Roman Museum.&quot;

== Description ==

One of the four inscriptions around the main entrance to the Baths of Diocletian reads, translated from Latin, &quot;Our Lords Diocletian and Maximian, the elder and invincible Augusti, fathers of the Emperors and Caesars, our lords Constantius and Maximian and Severus and Maximum, noblest Caesars, dedicated to their beloved Romans these auspicious Baths of Diocletian, which the divine Maximin on his return from Africa ordered to be built and consecrated in the name of his brother Diocletian, having purchased the premises required for so huge and remarkable work and furnishing them with the most sumptuous refinement.&quot; Although only fragments of the inscription are extant today, a complete transcription was made by an 8th- or 9th-century pilgrim and was preserved at Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland.

The enclosure of the bath complex took up 13 hectares (32 acres) of the district, about the same size as the Baths of Caracalla. The main entrance was to the northeast. To the southwest was a large exedra (now still visible as the outline of Piazza della Repubblica). The &quot;exedra&quot; was flanked by two large buildings, likely libraries. These in turn connected to circular halls: one of them is now the church of San Bernardo, the other is visible at the start of Via del Viminale. The central block of the baths was 280 (910 feet) by 160 meters (520 feet) or 10.85 acres (compared to the 6 acres of the Baths of Caracalla).

The central block consisted of &quot;frigidarium&quot;, &quot;tepidarium&quot; and &quot;caldarium&quot; along a single axis, with other halls arranged symmetrically around them. Flanking the frigidarium were two open-air gymnasiums (remains of the western one are accessible at Via Cernaia). Two octagonal halls flanked the &quot;caldarium&quot;.

Despite their similar size, the capacity of the Baths of Diocletian was said to be much greater than the Baths of Caracalla. This could be because the entrance and rooms were made larger than its predecessor in block size, which allowed more space and functionality. According to Olympiodorus, the baths were able to hold up to 3,000 people at one time. However, this claim is disputed because Olympiodorus never described how he calculated this figure.

=== The frigidarium ===
The word &quot;frigidarium&quot; originates from the Latin word &quot;frigeo&quot;, which means &quot;to be cold&quot;. The prominence of the room and its conjoining rooms showed the increase in popularity cold baths had during the early 4th century compared to hot baths. This also could have been a result of the depletion of the surrounding forests, resulting in a lack of fuel. The frigidarium, or &quot;cella frigidaria&quot; consisted of a pool and a host of smaller baths connected to the main room. Water entering the room would come from a pipe or cistern and would exit through a drain within the pool. The water from the pool was thought to have been reused to flush latrines within the complex. The frigidarium was used mainly as a swimming pool or a cold-water bath, depending on the time. Normally, one would continue on to the frigidarium after using the hot-water baths or after exercising in the palaestra. Noting the massive size of the room, it was believed to have also been used as a social room. This idea is supported by the presence of statues and elaborate niches along the walls. On each end of the frigidarium are large shallow pools that were made to be open-air bathing pools. Today the room forms the colossal transept section of the Basilica of St. Mary.

=== The caldarium ===

The word &quot;caldarium&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;caleo&quot;, meaning &quot;to be hot&quot;. The purpose of the caldarium was that of the principal bath chamber within the baths. From its namesake, the room was used for a hot-water bath or for saunas or steam rooms. The room could have also been used for oiling before or after a bath, but, in most cases, this was moved to a separate room off of the caldarium.

The caldarium, or &quot;cella caldaria&quot;, was rectangular in shape with many octagonal rooms found near it in the corner of the structure. The area seemed to be referencing the older Baths of Nero and Titus in its initial design. What set this caldarium apart was the sheer scale of the room compared to its predecessors. It continued a basilica-like theme from the frigidarium with a cross-vaulted middle bay and three projecting apses. These architectural techniques created the feeling of a more open space for the patron. Dressing rooms, also known as apodyteria, were located on either side of the caldarium. Along the sides of the caldarium were private rooms that are believed to have had multiple functions, including private baths, poetry readings, rhetoricians, etc. Other areas attached to the caldarium were a garden, lounging rooms, gymnasiums, and small halls and semicircular exedrae used as lecture and reading rooms.

=== Presence of libraries ===
Rectangular halls connected to the hemicycle have been suggested to be libraries because of their similar set-up to those in the Baths of Caracalla. Historians, to support this theory, have demonstrated that these halls with their niches could properly house scrolls and/or codices. (The author of the Life of Probus mentions that part of the Bibliotheca Ulpia, was located in the Forum of Trajan, and part within the Baths of Trajan, although he later contradicts that statement when referring to the &quot;Bibliotheca Ulpia).&quot; The presence of similar spaces in the Baths of Caracalla and the Baths of Trajan therefore makes it not unreasonable to assume that the baths of Diocletian contained a library.

Within the frigidarium, the use of external buttresses for the cross vaults was considered by some to be the first example of the scientific system of thrusts and counter-thrusts in architecture. Concerning the baths as a whole, it has been described as evoking the Imperial style, or a &quot;Classical&quot; image, which is the style of &quot;manipulation of space&quot;. To manipulate the space within this style, the forms of the building were simple and give the impression of a vast amount of open space. The builders of the baths used different techniques to create this effect. The exterior walls of the bath were encrusted with stucco to give the impression of stonework. This technique was quite common within the structures built during the Imperial style of Roman architecture, e.g., the baths of Constantine, the Basilica Nova, and parts of the Sessorian bridge. The interior parts of the bath were supported by vaulting ceilings and arches to create curvilinear lines. The structure of the roof is a typical example of Classical design. Architects used sloped forms to cover curved extrados (the outer surface of the arch) of the vaulted halls.

==Legacy==
From the central structure were derived the plans for the Basilica of Constantine.

The Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History building in Washington, D.C., was partially based on design elements from these baths, including its Diocletian windows.

== Present day ==

Parts of the structure were converted to ecclesiastical or other use, including:
*Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri
*Church of San Bernardo alle Terme
*Sections of the National Roman Museum

A part was, for many years, starting in the 1870s, the studio of the sculptor Moses Jacob Ezekiel. The &quot;Octagonal hall&quot; served as the planetarium of Rome from 1928 until 1983.

The museum is located in what is known as &quot;Michelangelo&#x27;s Cloister&quot; and other buildings that were part of the Carthusian monastery as well as several halls south of the eastern palestra. The former main entrance hall of the museum connects the 16th-century outer garden around a large Krater used as a fountain with the cloister. The Epigraphic Museum is located in modern premises. The prehistoric exhibits are on the first floor of the cloister colonnade. The cloister itself exhibits numerous pieces of statuary.

Other remains of the baths are visible several streets away.

The church of San Bernardo alle Terme uses one of only two circular buildings in the rectangular enclosure of the baths, flanking its southwestern wall. Between these two structures, a large &quot;exedra&quot; used to exist as part of the same wall. This is now occupied by Piazza della Repubblica.

<text>The Bobbettes were an American R&amp;B girl group who had a 1957 top 10 hit song called &quot;Mr. Lee&quot;. The group initially existed from 1955 to 1974 and included Jannie Pought (1945–1980), Emma Pought (born 1942), Reather Dixon (1944–2014), Laura Webb (1941–2001), and Helen Gathers (1942–2011).

==History==
The group, which originally formed in East Harlem, New York, in 1955, was first known as &quot;The Harlem Queens&quot;. The girls first met while singing at the Glee Club at P.S. 109 in Spanish Harlem. They were soon discovered by James Dailey, a record producer, who also became their manager, while playing a concert at the Apollo Theater&#x27;s amateur night, and were signed to a recording contract on the Atlantic label. The girls lived in the housing projects of 1905 Second Ave and 99th Street and sang in the hallways of the building and downstairs in the playground.

In 1957, the girls released their first hit single, &quot;Mr. Lee&quot;, an uptempo song in which the narrator proclaims her devotion to her crush—her school teacher. The girls actually disliked the real-life Mr. Lee and the original lyrics to the song were something of a put-down, but Atlantic insisted the group revise the lyrics before recording the song. The single, backed by &quot;Look at the Stars&quot;, became their biggest hit recording, peaking at #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop singles chart and spending four weeks at #1 on the R&amp;B chart. This made the Bobbettes the first girl group to release a #1 R&amp;B hit that also made the pop top 10. The song would later be covered by Diana Ross on the European version of her 1987 album &quot;Red Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot;. The personnel on &quot;Mr. Lee&quot; included Jesse Powell on tenor sax, Allan Hanlon and Al Caiola on guitar, Ray Ellis on piano, Milt Hinton on bass, and Joe Marshall on drums. &quot;Billboard&quot; named the song #79 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.

After a series of novelty songs for Atlantic that were unsuccessful, they recorded the original recording of &quot;I Shot Mr. Lee&quot;. Atlantic refused the song and the group left the label and signed with Teddy Vann and a new version was issued on the small Triple-X label. It started to climb the charts rapidly, eventually reaching #52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, whereupon Atlantic released their own version of the song.

Over the next few years they followed up that single with such other recordings as &quot;Have Mercy Baby&quot;, &quot;You Are My Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;You Belong to Me&quot;, and &quot;Dance with Me Georgie&quot;. They then signed with End Records and released the songs &quot;Teach Me Tonight&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It Like That&quot; (answer to Chris Kenner&#x27;s &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;). Although the recording of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It Like That&quot; was the girls&#x27; last chart record, they continued to record for a series of record labels, including Diamond, RCA Victor and Mayhew, before disbanding in 1974. They also toured the oldies circuits for many years having reformed after their initial breakup. Other recordings by the Bobbettes include, &quot;Oh My Pa-Pa&quot;, &quot;Speedy&quot;, &quot;Zoomy&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Ree-ah-Zole (The Teenage Talk)&quot;. Their single of &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Face The World&quot; on RCA Victor is a Northern soul single.

In 1980, Jannie Pought was stabbed to death at age 34 by a stranger in New Jersey.

Reather Dixon (born on May 1, 1944, in Bamberg, South Carolina) died on January 8, 2014, at age 69.

The Bobbettes were nominated for induction in the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.

<text>In the Bemani series of rhythm video games by Konami, it appears that seemingly hundreds of different musicians and groups perform the songs. However, in reality there exists only a core group of a few dozen Konami artists, performing under pseudonyms and forming new groups.

All names are in Western order (family name last).

This list does not include artists whose songs have been licensed by Konami, primarily through the Dancemania division of Toshiba-EMI.

<doc id="951156" wikidata="Q211042" url="?curid=951156" title="Kodkod">
<text>The kodkod (Leopardus guigna), also called güiña, is the smallest felid species native to the Americas. It lives primarily in central and southern Chile, as well as marginally in adjoining areas of Argentina. Since 2002, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List as the total population may be less than 10,000 mature individuals; it is threatened by persecution, and habitat loss and prey base.

==Characteristics==
The kodkod&#x27;s fur color ranges from brownish-yellow to grey-brown. It has dark spots, a pale underside and a ringed tail. The ears are black with a white spot, while the dark spots on the shoulders and neck almost merge to form a series of dotted streaks. Melanistic kodkods with spotted black coats are quite common. It has a small head, large feet, and a thick tail. Adult kodkods are in head to body length with a short tail and a shoulder height of about . Weight ranges between .

===Melanistic phenotype===
The melanistic phenotype is caused by the deletion of a single cysteine residue at position 126 of Agouti-signaling protein. This disrupts one of the four disulphide bonds in the normal protein, altering its tertiary structure and reducing its ability to bind to the melanocortin 1 receptor. Normally this interaction upregulates the production of orange pheomelanin and downregulates the production of black eumelanin, however, in the mutated form, this interaction is prevented, resulting in darker coat color than normal.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis guigna&quot; was the scientific name used in 1782 by Juan Ignacio Molina who first described a kodkod from Chile.
&quot;Felis tigrillo&quot; was the name used in 1844 by Heinrich Rudolf Schinz.

The genus &quot;Leopardus&quot; was proposed in 1842 by John Edward Gray, when he described two spotted cat skins from Central America and two from India in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London.
The subgenus &quot;Oncifelis&quot; was proposed in 1851 by Nikolai Severtzov with the Geoffroy&#x27;s cat as type species.
The kodkod was subordinated to &quot;Leopardus&quot; in 1958, and to &quot;Oncifelis&quot; in 1978.

Today, the genus &quot;Leopardus&quot; is widely recognized as valid, with two kodkod subspecies:
* &quot;L. g. guigna&quot; (Molina, 1782) occurs in southern Chile and Argentina
* &quot;L. g. tigrillo&quot; (Schinz, 1844) occurs in central and northern Chile

== Distribution and habitat ==
The kodkod is strongly associated with mixed temperate rainforests of the southern Andean and coastal ranges, particularly the Valdivian and Araucaria forests of Chile, which is characterized by the presence of bamboo in the understory. It prefers evergreen temperate rainforest habitats to deciduous temperate moist forests, sclerophyllous scrub and coniferous forests. It is tolerant of altered habitats, being found in secondary forest and shrub as well as primary forest, and on the fringes of settled and cultivated areas.
It ranges up to the treeline at approximately . In Argentina, it has been recorded from moist montane forest, which has Valdivian temperate rain forest characteristics, including a multi-layered structure with bamboo, and numerous lianas and epiphytes.

==Ecology and behavior==
Kodkods are equally active during the day and during the night, although they only venture into open terrain under the cover of darkness. During the day, they rest in dense vegetation in ravines, along streams with heavy cover, and in piles of dead gorse. They are excellent climbers, and easily able to climb trees more than a meter in diameter. They are terrestrial predators of birds, lizards and rodents in the ravines and forested areas, feeding on southern lapwing, austral thrush, chucao tapaculo, huet-huet, domestic geese and chicken.

Male kodkods maintain exclusive territories in size, while females occupy smaller ranges of just .

=== Reproduction ===
The gestation period lasts about 72–78 days. The average litter size is one to three kittens. This species may live to be about 11 years old.

== Threats ==
The kodkod has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List as the total population may be less than 10,000 mature individuals. It is threatened foremost by logging, which entails the spread of pine forest plantations and agriculture, particularly in central Chile. In 1997 to 1998, two out of five radio-collared kodkods were killed on Chiloé Island after raiding chicken coops.

==&quot;The Photo Ark&quot;==
* On May 15, 2020, National Geographic announced that the kodkod was the milestone 10,000th animal photographed for &quot;The Photo Ark&quot;, bringing the project about two-thirds of the way toward completion.

<text>Shenkeng District () is a rural district in central New Taipei City in northern Taiwan. Formerly an agricultural and mining town, it is now famous for its numerous tofu restaurants and vendors.

== History ==
The area is first recorded as the preserve of a tribe of Pingpu aborigines during the Qing dynasty period in Taiwan. When Han Chinese farmers eventually moved in to develop the area, they bought the low-lying land from the aborigines and began cultivation in the main valley. The modern name of the township, Shenkeng, literally means &quot;deep pit&quot; or &quot;deep mine&quot;. The area used to have several active coal mines. The name has also been explained with reference to the mountains surrounding Shenkeng on all sides, which make the terrain similar to a pit.

On December 25, 2010, Shenkeng Township () became Shenkeng District ().

== Geography ==
Shenkeng is a rural district which borders Taipei City&#x27;s Wenshan District to the west, Nangang District to the north, and the Shiding District of New Taipei City to the east.

== Politics and government ==
Politics in Shenkeng have largely been uneventful; the town is considered a safe seat for the Kuomintang. An exception was in 1996, when several members of the council were arrested on suspicion of connection with organised crime.

===Administrative divisions===
Shenkeng District includes eight urban villages:
* Shenkeng (), Puxin (), Wanshun (), Wanfu (), Tuku (), Laizhong (), Arou (), Shenggao ()

==Demographics==

In the years 2012 to 2017, the population of Shenkeng District hovered around 23,600 with a steadily ageing population.

== Education ==
Shenkeng is home to Tungnan University, a private technical university. There is also a Junior High School and an Elementary School in the town.

==Tourist attractions==
The economy of Shenkeng is centred on tourism, and that tourism is based largely on tofu. The district is sufficiently well known in culinary circles that it has been a subject of media interest in Japan and Hong Kong. The tofu from Shenkeng has an unusual ratio of soybean to gypsum, giving it a yellowish colour and distinctive flavour. The town has become so readily identified with tofu that it has earned the epithet &quot;The Tofu Capital&quot;.

There are also extensive hiking trails, some of which were in use during the Japanese era by anti-Japanese guerilla fighters.

* Shenkeng Old Street

== Transportation ==
Transportation in Shenkeng is limited to roads only; there is as yet no railway or mass transit service, although proposals have been made to extend the Wenshan Line of the Taipei Metro into Shenkeng. Three bus companies offer passenger services within Shenkeng and between Shenkeng and surrounding settlements.

<doc id="951184" wikidata="Q715701" url="?curid=951184" title="William Le Baron Jenney">
<text>William Le Baron Jenney (September 25, 1832 – June 14, 1907) was an American architect and engineer known for building the first skyscraper in 1884.

In 1998, Jenney was ranked number 89 in the book &quot;1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking the Men and Women Who Shaped the Millennium&quot;.

==Life and career==
Jenney was born in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, on September 25, 1832, the son of William Proctor Jenney and Eliza LeBaron Gibbs. Jenney began his formal education at Phillips Academy, Andover, in 1846, and at the Lawrence Scientific school at Harvard in 1853, but transferred to École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures (École Centrale Paris) to study engineering and architecture. In Paris he discovers the writings of Viollet-le-Duc and he will become one of his followers: &quot;&quot;the research and discoveries of Viollet le Duc surpass anything that any other author has been able to write&quot;.&quot;
At École Centrale Paris, he learned the latest iron construction techniques as well as the classical functionalist doctrine of Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand (1760–1834) - Professor of Architecture at the Ecole Polytechnique. He graduated in 1856, one year after his classmate, Gustave Eiffel, the designer of the Eiffel Tower.

In 1861, he returned to the US to join the Union Army as an engineer in the Civil War, designing fortifications for Generals Sherman and Grant.

By the end of the war, he had become a major, and was Engineer-in-Charge at Nashville&#x27;s Union headquarters. After the war, in 1867, Jenney moved to Chicago and began his own architectural office, which specialized in commercial buildings and urban planning. 

During the late 1870s, he commuted weekly to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to start and teach in the architecture program at the University of Michigan. In later years future leaders of the Chicago School like Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, William Holabird, and Martin Roche, performed their architectural apprenticeships on Jenney&#x27;s staff. 

On May 8, 1867, Jenney and Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Hannah Cobb, from Cleveland, Ohio, were married. They had two children named Max and Francis.

Jenney was elected an Associate of the American Institute of Architects in 1872 and became a Fellow in 1885. He served as first Vice President from 1898 to 1899. In Chicago, he designed the Ludington Building and Manhattan Building, both built in 1891 and National Historic Landmarks. He also designed the Horticultural Building for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (1893) held in Chicago.

==Advent of the steel-frame skyscraper==
Jenney is best known for designing the ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago. The building was the first fully metal-framed building and is considered the first skyscraper. It was built from 1884 to 1885, enlarged by adding two stories in 1891, and demolished in 1931. In his designs, he used metal columns and beams instead of stone and brick to support the building&#x27;s upper levels.
The steel needed to support the Home Insurance Building weighed only one-third as much as a ten-story building made of heavy masonry. Using this method, the weight of the building was reduced, thus allowing the possibility to construct even taller structures. Later, he solved the problem of fireproof construction for tall buildings by using masonry, iron, and terra cotta flooring and partitions. From 1889 to 1891, he displayed his system in the construction of the Second Leiter Building, also in Chicago.

According to a popular story, one day he came home early and surprised his wife who was reading. She put her book down on top of a birdcage and ran to meet him. He strode across the room, lifted the book, and dropped it back on the bird cage two or three times. Then, he exclaimed: &quot;It works! It works! Don’t you see? If this little cage can hold this heavy book, why can’t an iron or steel cage be the framework for a whole building?&quot; Jenney applied his new idea to the construction of the Home Insurance Building, the first skyscraper in the world, erected in 1884 at the corner of LaSalle and Monroe Streets in Chicago. Another source cites the inspiration for the steel skyscraper as coming from vernacular, Philippine architecture, where wooden framed construction gave Jenney the idea. The Home Insurance Building was the first example of a steel skeleton building, the first grid of iron columns, girders, beams, and floor joists ever constructed.

==Legacy==
He died in Los Angeles, California, on June 15, 1907. After Jenney&#x27;s death, his ashes were scattered over his wife&#x27;s grave, just south of the Eternal Silence section of Uptown&#x27;s Graceland Cemetery. In 1998, Jenney was ranked number 89 in the book &quot;1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking the Men and Women Who Shaped the Millennium&quot;.

Original notes and papers of Jenney, including &quot;Jenney&#x27;s 1884 holograph notebook containing, among other things, structural calculations for the Home Insurance Building, and his undated sketch entitled &#x27;Key to the sky scraper.&#x27;&quot;, are held by the Art Institute of Chicago.

<doc id="951185" wikidata="Q322597" url="?curid=951185" title="Carl Wayne">
<text>Colin David Tooley (18 August 1943 – 31 August 2004), better known as Carl Wayne, was an English singer and actor. He is best remembered as the lead singer of The Move, a group that he co-founded in 1965. He sings lead on several of the band&#x27;s hits, such as &quot;Curly&quot; (in which he also plays sitar), &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot;, &quot;I Can Hear the Grass Grow&quot;, and &quot;Night of Fear&quot;.

Wayne was born and raised in Birmingham and entered the music business playing bass guitar. However, he switched to vocals and formed the G-Men, but later joined The Vikings (later Carl Wayne and the Vikings), a band which also included Ace Kefford and Bev Bevan. Kefford and Trevor Burton formed a group, The Move, which Wayne, Bevan, and Roy Wood would join, hitting huge success within the band. He left in 1970, and pursued a cabaret career with slight success.

Wayne notably played Tom-Tom in several episodes of Emu&#x27;s TV programmes, such as the Christmas special from 1977. In 2000, he joined The Hollies, and performed with them until his death in 2004.

==Early days==
Wayne was born in the area of Winson Green, Birmingham, and grew up in the Hodge Hill part of the city.

== Musical career ==

=== Early musical career ===
Inspired by the American rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll of Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, he formed the G-Men in the late 1950s, and joined local band the Vikings, where his powerful baritone voice and pink stage suit helped make them one of the leading rock groups in the Midlands. He initially played bass guitar and played the instrument in a gig for the Vikings, though decided to ditch the bass after he didn&#x27;t enjoy his playing. His change of name was inspired by the movie star John Wayne, with the Scandinavian &#x27;Carl&#x27; to fit into the &#x27;Vikings&#x27; theme. In 1963 they followed in the footsteps of the Beatles and other Liverpool bands by performing in the clubs of Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Nuremberg. On returning to Birmingham, in the wake of the Beatles&#x27; success, record companies were keen to sign similar guitar bands. The Vikings signed with Pye Records, but all three singles failed to chart.

Wayne represented England at the prestigious Golden Orpheus Song Festival in Bulgaria. In front of a live and televised audience of over 20 million, Wayne won first prize.

=== The Move ===
In December 1965 he joined the Move, a Birmingham beat supergroup drawn from top local bands. They included three members of the Vikings (bass guitarist Chris &#x27;Ace&#x27; Kefford, drummer Bev Bevan and Wayne himself), Trevor Burton (lead guitarist with Danny King and the Mayfair Set), and Roy Wood (lead guitarist with Mike Sheridan and the Nightriders). They enjoyed three years of hits with singles such as &quot;Night of Fear&quot;, &quot;I Can Hear The Grass Grow&quot;, &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Fire Brigade&quot;, and their number one success &quot;Blackberry Way&quot;. In their early years the Move had a stage act which occasionally saw Wayne taking an axe to television sets, or chainsawing a Cadillac to pieces at the Roundhouse, London, during &quot;Fire Brigade&quot;, an escapade which resulted in the Soho area being jammed with fire engines, and the group being banned for a while from every theatre venue in the UK.

But by the start of 1968, the group began fragmenting as a result of personal and musical differences. Wayne grew frustrated with the Move&#x27;s management pushing Wood to the forefront of the band and himself to the background by encouraging Wood to write the Move&#x27;s songs and allowing the Move to record songs which Wayne did not sing lead on. According to Wood, the management were indifferent to who sang lead, an indifference that proved justified after the Wood-sung &quot;Fire Brigade&quot; and &quot;Blackberry Way&quot; became two of the Move&#x27;s biggest hits. When the management decided that Wood would be the producer for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Shazam&quot;, Wayne pushed back, becoming a co-producer on &quot;Shazam&quot; and choosing many of the cover songs which appeared on it. Wayne&#x27;s increasingly MOR style, and aspirations towards cabaret, were at odds with Wood&#x27;s desire to experiment in a more progressive and classical direction, which would lead to the foundation of the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). Wayne was initially offered to play timpani for ELO, but rejected the offer. Wayne left the band shortly after the band&#x27;s sole tour of the United States.

=== Solo performing and acting ===
He went solo and made several singles and record albums, some including songs written and produced by Roy Wood. Among his singles were &quot;Way Back in the Fifties&quot;, &quot;Hi Summer&quot; backed with &quot;My Girl And Me&quot;, both written and produced by Lynsey de Paul, the theme song to an ITV variety series he co-hosted, &quot;Maybe God&#x27;s Got Something Up His Sleeve&quot;, the John Lennon song &quot;Imagine&quot;, plus a cover version of the Cliff Richard hit &quot;Miss You Nights&quot;, and Wood&#x27;s &quot;Aerial Pictures&quot;. He was originally offered the chance to record &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; but rejected it as &quot;rubbish&quot;; it was promptly given to a new band, the Rubettes, and it launched their career with a number one hit. As well as &quot;Hi Summer&quot;, his work on television included singing the theme songs to the talent show &quot;New Faces&quot;, one of which, &quot;You&#x27;re a Star!&quot;, was a minor hit for him in 1973. In 1977, Wayne took part in the &quot;Song for Europe&quot; contest, hoping to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. His song, &quot;A Little Give, A Little Take&quot; finished in 11th place out of twelve songs.

Wayne also made a few recordings with ELO as guest vocalist, though these remained unreleased until they appeared as bonus tracks on a remastered re-issue of the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;ELO 2&quot; in 2003. He never made the charts after leaving the Move, but still enjoyed a steady career in cabaret and on television, recording versions of songs from the shows of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, as well as voiceovers and jingles. He sang backing vocals on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Earth Moving&quot;, released in 1989.

In his acting career he had a small role in the Birmingham-based soap opera, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and in 1974 married Susan Hanson, another member of the cast. His most acclaimed stage role was as the narrator in Willy Russell&#x27;s &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; between 1990 and 1996. Later he became a presenter on BBC Radio WM, in the course of which he interviewed several of his former colleagues from the Move, among other guests. He was also a fund raiser for leukaemia research, and ran several London marathons for charity. He also made an appearance on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; in 1985, in which he played the &quot;Face&quot; character in a parody of &quot;The A-Team&quot;. From 1983 to 1988 he appeared in various Emu TV programmes, in the segment &quot;Boggles Kingdom&quot; alongside Susan Maughan and Rod Hull. The segment revolved around Rod&#x27;s ancestor, King Boggle, his sister Princess Hortensia, and servant Odd Job John played by Wayne who were trapped in medieval times. Wayne performed several songs during the show, including renditions of Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz and Greensleeves. 

Carl was also a guest singer with Spike Edney&#x27;s SAS Band.

==With the Hollies and death==
In 2000, on the retirement of lead vocalist Allan Clarke, he joined the Hollies, touring Europe and Australasia with them, as well as playing venues all over the United Kingdom. They recorded a new song, &quot;How Do I Survive&quot;, in February 2003, which appeared as the only previously unreleased item on a 46-track compilation CD of the Hollies&#x27; greatest hits later that year. In addition to most of the Hollies&#x27; songs, they included &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Blackberry Way&quot; in their live repertoire. Their drummer Bobby Elliott described him as &quot;a fearless performer and powerhouse singer&quot;.

Wayne played what turned out to be his last concert with the group on 10 July 2004 at Egersund, Norway. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to hospital for tests; he was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer and died a few weeks later at age 61. He left a widow, (Susan Hanson), and their son Jack.

Because of poor sales, none of Wayne&#x27;s solo releases remained on catalogue for long during his lifetime. In 2006 an album of his performances, remastered with the involvement of Wood and some previously unreleased, was issued under the title &quot;Songs From The Wood And Beyond 1973–2003&quot;. Two tracks by Wayne and Choral Union appear on the two-CD set &quot;Friends &amp; Relatives&quot;, a compilation of tracks by Electric Light Orchestra and associated acts.

<doc id="951188" wikidata="Q4710588" url="?curid=951188" title="Albert Johnson Walker">
<text>Albert Johnson Walker (born 1946), also known as The Rolex Killer, is a Canadian criminal serving a prison term for embezzlement and murder. He is known for murdering an Englishman whose identity he had been assuming, and for posing for years as though his own daughter was his wife.

==Early life==

Originally from Paris, Ontario, Walker was a high school drop-out. After doing numerous odd jobs, he was eventually hired as a bank teller for a trust company. He also started filing other people&#x27;s income tax returns. Walker quit his job at the trust company some two years later to establish his own freelance bookkeeping business, &quot;Walker Financial Services Incorporated.&quot;

==Walker Financial==

In over a decade, Walker Financial grew into a six-branch operation with about thirty employees. In 1986, a stock deal that Walker had invested in collapsed. As a mortgage broker and financier, Walker defrauded about seventy Canadian clients of $3.2 million. 

In 1990, he fled to Europe with the second of his three daughters. In 1993, Walker was charged in Canada with 18 counts of fraud, theft and money laundering. Over a period of time, Walker became Canada&#x27;s most wanted criminal and the second most wanted by Interpol.

==Time in England==

Walker eventually made his way to Harrogate in North Yorkshire where he lived with his daughter, who neighbours believed was his wife. During this time, that daughter had two children, the paternity of whom has not been revealed. He changed his name to David Davis and began a business career with television repairman Ronald Joseph Platt. 

Platt, raised in Canada, wished to return to his home country. Walker bankrolled this trip, but claimed he needed Platt&#x27;s driver&#x27;s licence, signature stamp and birth certificate for the business. When Platt left for Canada in 1992, initially with the intent of permanently settling there, Walker assumed his identity.

==Murder and conviction==

Platt ran out of money in Canada and returned to England in 1995. Walker took Platt out on a fishing trip on 20 July 1996 and murdered him, weighed him down with an anchor, and dumped his body in the sea. Two weeks later the body was discovered in the English Channel by fisherman John Copik with a Rolex wristwatch being the only identifiable object on the body. Since the Rolex movement had a serial number and was engraved with special markings every time it was serviced, British police traced the service records from Rolex. 

Ronald Joseph Platt was identified as the owner of the watch and the victim of the murder. In addition British police were able to determine the date of death by examining the date on the watch calendar and since the Rolex movement had a reserve of two to three days of operation when inactive and it was fully waterproof, they were able to determine the time of death within a small margin of error. Walker was apprehended shortly thereafter.

In the spring of 1998, Walker&#x27;s preliminary hearing was held in the village courtroom in Teignmouth, Devon, England. On 27 April 1998, Walker pleaded not guilty in his murder trial in the English city of Exeter. He was found guilty in 1998 and received an automatic life sentence for murder. Had Walker not been convicted, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office would have transferred him back to Canada to face his fraud charges.

==Transfer to Canada==
On 22 February 2005, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that Walker would be transferred to a Canadian prison, where he faced additional charges of fraud, theft and money laundering.

On 23 July 2007, Walker was sentenced in Kingston, Ontario, to four years for fraud and one year concurrent for violations of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada). He started serving his life sentence in Canada at Kingston Penitentiary. When that prison was permanently closed in 2013 he was transferred to a prison in the Canadian province of British Columbia.

== Parole ==
In February 2024, Walker was denied day parole, despite a recommendation by Correctional Services Canada, because the Parole Board of Canada said there were &quot;...concerns with how you presented the index offences to your community parole officer while on day parole.” Walker had been allowed out for 60 days for an unsupervised course in 2023. Walker is barred from working in the financial industry and from contacting his ex-wife and his victims.

==Media==
In 1998, two books were published detailing the story of Albert Walker. &quot;Toronto Star&quot; journalist Bill Schiller wrote &quot;A Hand in the Water: The Many Lies of Albert Walker&quot;, while &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; journalist Alan Cairns wrote &quot;Nothing Sacred: The Many Lives and Betrayals of Albert Walker&quot;.

In 2000, the episode &quot;Time Will Tell&quot;, of the series &quot;Forensic Files&quot;, details the investigation of Ronald Platt&#x27;s murder and the capture of Albert Walker.

In 2000, a theatrical play by Peter Colley, &quot;Stolen Lives, The Albert Walker Story&quot;, was performed at the Blyth Festival in Blyth, Ontario.

The 2002 made-for-TV movie, &quot;AKA Albert Walker&quot;, documents Walker&#x27;s crimes and eventual arrest.

In 2002, Walker&#x27;s ex-wife, Barb Walker, self-published a book entitled &quot;Dancing Devil: My Twenty Years with Albert Walker&quot;, detailing her life with Walker leading up to his departure from Canada with their daughter.

In 2005, the episode &quot;Body Double&quot;, of the documentary crime series &quot;Interpol Investigates&quot;, detailed the murder investigation.

In 2007, the episode &quot;The (Almost) Perfect Murder&quot;, of the documentary series &quot;Real Crime&quot;, examines the background behind Walker&#x27;s arrest in England.

In 2010 British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; aired a storyline that bore a striking resemblance to the Albert Walker/Ronald Platt murder, in which character John Stape, after being struck off the Teaching Register for kidnapping a school girl, steals the identity of a former colleague, Colin Fishwick, to once again gain employment as a teacher. Fishwick had emigrated to Canada, allowing Stape to freely assume his identity. But Fishwick chose to return to the UK, uncovering Stape&#x27;s deception and ultimately dying during a confrontation with Stape. Although Stape was not directly responsible for Fishwick&#x27;s death (Fishwick had been beaten savagely by another man just days before their confrontation and had succumbed to his injuries), Stape chose not to report the death. He knew he could easily be shown to have a motive for murdering Fishwick and buried his body in a construction site instead.

<text>Crude electric carriages were first invented in the late 1820s and 1830s. Practical, commercially available electric vehicles appeared during the 1890s. An electric vehicle held the vehicular land speed record until around 1900. In the early 20th century, the high cost, low top speed, and short-range of battery electric vehicles, compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, led to a worldwide decline in their use as private motor vehicles. Electric vehicles have continued to be used for loading and freight equipment and for public transport – especially rail vehicles.

At the beginning of the 21st century, interest in electric and alternative fuel vehicles in private motor vehicles increased due to: growing concern over the problems associated with hydrocarbon-fueled vehicles, including damage to the environment caused by their emissions; the sustainability of the current hydrocarbon-based transportation infrastructure; and improvements in electric vehicle technology.

Since 2010, combined sales of all-electric cars and utility vans achieved 1 million units delivered globally in September 2016, 4.8 million electric cars in use at the end of 2019, and cumulative sales of light-duty plug-in electric cars reached the 10 million unit milestone by the end of 2020. The global ratio between annual sales of battery electric cars and plug-in hybrids went from 56:44 (1.3:1) in 2012 to 74:26 (2.8:1) in 2019, and fell to 69:31 (2.2:1) in 2020. , the fully electric Tesla Model 3 is the world&#x27;s all-time best selling plug-in electric passenger car, with around 645,000 units.

==Early history==

===Electric model cars===
Designs of electric motors by individuals such as Benjamin Franklin led to ideas for electric vehicles. The invention of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people. In 1828, the Hungarian priest and physicist Ányos Jedlik invented an early type of electric motor, and created a small model car powered by his new motor. Between 1832 and 1839, Scottish inventor Robert Anderson also invented a crude electric carriage. In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker from Germany also created a small-scale electric car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.

===Electric locomotives===
In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport built a similar contraption which operated on a short, circular, electrified track. The first known electric locomotive was built in 1837, in Scotland by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen. It was powered by galvanic cells (batteries). Davidson later built a larger locomotive named &quot;Galvani&quot;, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in 1841. The vehicle had two direct-drive reluctance motors, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple commutators. It hauled a load of at for a distance of . It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September of the following year, but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their security of employment.
A patent for the use of rails as conductors of electric current was granted in England in 1840, and similar patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in the United States in 1847.
The first battery rail car was used in 1887 on the Royal Bavarian State Railways.

==First full-scale electric cars==
Rechargeable batteries that provided a viable means for storing electricity on board a vehicle did not come into being until 1859, with the invention of the lead–acid battery by French physicist Gaston Planté. Camille Alphonse Faure, another French scientist, significantly improved the design of the battery in 1881; his improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale.

What is likely the first human-carrying electric vehicle with its own power source was tested along a Paris street in April 1881 by French inventor Gustave Trouvé. In 1880 Trouvé improved the efficiency of a small electric motor developed by Siemens (from a design purchased from in 1867) and using the recently developed rechargeable battery, fitted it to an English James Starley tricycle, so inventing the world&#x27;s first electric vehicle. Although this was successfully tested on 19 April 1881 along the Rue Valois in central Paris, he was unable to patent it. Trouvé swiftly adapted his battery-powered motor to marine propulsion; to make it easy to carry his marine conversion to and from his workshop to the nearby River Seine, Trouvé made it portable and removable from the boat, thus inventing the outboard motor. On 26 May 1881, the 5-metre Trouvé boat prototype, called Le Téléphone reached a speed of going upstream and downstream.

English inventor Thomas Parker, who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite, built his first electric car in Wolverhampton in 1884, although the only documentation is a photograph from 1895.

Parker&#x27;s long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London. Production of the car was in the hands of the Elwell-Parker Company, established in 1882 for the construction and sale of electric trams. The company merged with other rivals in 1888 to form the Electric Construction Corporation; this company had a virtual monopoly on the British electric car market in the 1890s. The company manufactured the first electric &#x27;dog cart&#x27; in 1896.

France and the United Kingdom were the first nations to support the widespread development of electric vehicles. German engineer Andreas Flocken built the first real electric car in 1888.

Electric trains were also used to transport coal out of mines, as their motors did not use up precious oxygen. Before the pre-eminence of internal combustion engines, electric automobiles also held many speed and distance records. Among the most notable of these records was the breaking of the speed barrier, by Camille Jenatzy on 29 April 1899 in his &#x27;rocket-shaped&#x27; vehicle Jamais Contente, which reached a top speed of . Also notable was Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s design and construction of an all-wheel drive electric car, powered by a motor in each hub, which also set several records in the hands of its owner E.W. Hart.

The first electric car in the United States was developed in 1890–91 by Scotland-born William Morrison (es) of Des Moines, Iowa; the vehicle was a six-passenger wagon capable of reaching a speed of . It was not until 1895 that consumers began to devote attention to electric vehicles after A.L. Ryker introduced the first electric tricycles to the U.S.
==1890s-1910s: Golden age==
Interest in motor vehicles increased greatly in the late 1890s and early 1900s.
Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century. In London, Walter Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London in 1897. They were soon nicknamed &quot;Hummingbirds&quot; due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made. In the same year in New York City, the Samuel&#x27;s Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 electric hansom cabs. The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form the Electric Vehicle Company.

Electric vehicles had a number of advantages over their early-1900s competitors. They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no gear shifting, they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine.

Electric cars found popularity among well-heeled customers who used them as city cars, where their limited range proved to be even less of a disadvantage.

Acceptance of electric cars was initially hampered by a lack of power infrastructure. In the United States by the turn of the century, 40 per cent of automobiles were powered by steam, 38 per cent by electricity, and 22 per cent by petrol. A total of 33,842 electric cars were registered in the United States, and the U.S. became the country where electric cars had gained the most acceptance. Most early electric vehicles were massive, ornate carriages designed for the upper-class customers that made them popular. They featured luxurious interiors and were replete with expensive materials. Electric vehicles were often marketed as luxury cars for women, which may have generated a stigma among male consumers. Sales of electric cars peaked in the early 1910s. There were over 300 listed manufacturers who produced a vehicle in the United States until 1942.

In 1910s, The Standard Electric used Westinghouse electric motors and claimed to have a range of 110 miles on a charge. It was operated by a tiller from the left-hand side. The controller had six forward speeds, and had a top speed of 20-mph. The model M was a closed model Coupe or open Runabout, and priced from $1,785 to $1,900.

The Beardsley Electric Company, founded in Los Angeles by Volney S. Beardsley in 1913, produced 661 electric cars between 1914 and 1917. A typical cruising range was . One model, the &quot;light town car,&quot; in 1916 was priced at .

=== Power as a service and General Vehicle ===
To overcome the limited operating range of electric vehicles, and the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896. The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover the maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Wagon Company cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.

In New York City, in the pre-World War I era, ten electric vehicle companies banded together to form the New York Electric Vehicle Association. The association included manufacturers and dealers, among them General Motors&#x27; truck division, and the aforementioned General Vehicle division of General Electric, which claimed to have almost 2,000 operating vehicles in the metropolitan region. When opening their flagship department store, Lord and Taylor boasted of its electric vehicle fleet – numbering 38 trucks – and the conveyor system to efficiently load and unload goods.

==1920s–1950s: Dark age of Electric Vehicles==

After enjoying success at the beginning of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose its position in the automobile market. A number of developments contributed to this situation. By the 1920s, an improved road infrastructure improved travel times, creating a need for vehicles with a greater range than that offered by electric cars. Worldwide discoveries of large petroleum reserves led to the wide availability of affordable petrol, making petrol-powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed (no more than 24–32 km/h or 15–20 mph) and low range (50–65 km or 30–40 miles), and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.

Gasoline cars also overcame much of their negatives compared to electrics, in several areas. Whereas ICE cars originally had to be hand-cranked to start – a difficult and sometimes dangerous activity – the invention of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912 eliminated the need of a hand starting crank. Further, while gasoline engines are inherently noisier than electric motors, the invention of the muffler by Milton O. Reeves and Marshall T. Reeves in 1897 significantly reduced the noise to tolerable levels. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down. By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.

Most electric car makers stopped production at some point in the 1910s. Electric vehicles became popular for certain applications where their limited range did not pose major problems. Forklift trucks were electrically powered when they were introduced by Yale in 1923. In Europe, especially the United Kingdom, milk floats were powered by electricity, and for most of the 20th century the majority of the world&#x27;s battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats. Electric golf carts were produced by Lektro as early as 1954. By the 1920s, the early heyday of electric cars had passed, and a decade later, the electric automobile industry had effectively disappeared.

Years passed without a major revival in the use of electric cars. Fuel-starved European countries fighting in World War II experimented with electric cars such as the British milk floats and the French Bréguet Aviation car, but overall, while ICE development progressed at a brisk pace, electric vehicle technology stagnated. In the late 1950s, Henney Coachworks and the National Union Electric Company, makers of Exide batteries, formed a joint venture to produce a new electric car, the Henney Kilowatt, based on the French Renault Dauphine. The car was produced in 36-volt and 72-volt configurations. The 72-volt models had a top speed approaching and could travel for nearly an hour on a single charge. Despite Kilowatt&#x27;s improved performance with respect to previous electric cars, it was about double the cost of a regular gasoline-powered Dauphine, and production ended in 1961.
==1960s1990s: Revival of interest==

In 1959, American Motors Corporation (AMC) and Sonotone Corporation announced a joint research effort to consider producing an electric car powered by a &quot;self-charging&quot; battery. AMC had a reputation for innovation in economical cars while Sonotone had technology for making sintered plate nickel-cadmium batteries that could be recharged rapidly and weighed less than traditional lead-acid versions. That same year, Nu-Way Industries showed an experimental electric car with a one-piece plastic body that was to begin production in early 1960.

In the mid-1960s a few battery-electric concept cars appeared, such as the Scottish Aviation Scamp (1965), and an electric version of General Motors gasoline car, the Electrovair (1966). None of them entered production. The 1973 Enfield 8000 did make it into small-scale production, 112 were eventually produced. In 1967, AMC partnered with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. A nickel-cadmium battery supplied power to an all-electric 1969 Rambler American station wagon. Other &quot;plug-in&quot; experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton included the Amitron (1967) and the similar Electron (1977).

On 31 July 1971, an electric car received the unique distinction of becoming the first crewed vehicle to drive on the Moon; that car was the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was first deployed during the Apollo 15 mission. The &quot;Moon buggy&quot; was developed by Boeing and GM subsidiary Delco Electronics (co-founded by Kettering) featured a DC drive motor in each wheel, and a pair of 36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries.

After years outside the limelight, the energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s brought about renewed interest in the perceived independence electric cars had from the fluctuations of the hydrocarbon energy market. However, vehicles such as the intensely-marketed Sinclair C5 failed. General Motors created a concept car using another gasoline car as the base, the Electrovette (1976). At the 1990 Los Angeles Auto Show, General Motors President Roger Smith unveiled the GM Impact electric concept car, along with the announcement that GM would build electric cars for sale to the public.

From the 1960s to the 1990s, a number of companies made battery electric vehicles converted from existing manufactured models, often using gliders. None were sold in large numbers, with sales hampered by high cost and a limited range. Most of these vehicles were sold to government agencies and electric utility companies. The passage of the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development and Demonstration Act of 1976 in the US provided government incentives for development of electric vehicles in the US. Electric Fuel Propulsion Corporation (now Apollo Energy Systems) produced the Electrosport (a converted AMC Hornet), the Mars I (a converted Renault Dauphine), and the Mars II (a converted Renault R-10). Jet Industries sold the Electra-Van 600 (a converted Subaru Sambar 600), the Electra-Van 750 (converted Mazda B2000/Ford Courier pickup trucks), the Electrica (converted Ford Escort/Mercury Lynx cars) and the Electrica 007 (converted Dodge Omni 024/Plymouth Horizon TC3 cars). U.S. Electricar Corp., based in Massachusetts, sold the Lectric Leopard, a converted Renault 5. Electric Vehicle Associates sold the Current Fare (a converted Ford Fairmont) and the Change of Pace (a converted AMC Pacer). U.S. Electricar, Inc., based in California, sold a converted Geo Prizm. Solectria Corporation (now Azure Dynamics) sold the Solectria Force (a converted Geo Metro) and the E10 (a converted Chevrolet S-10). Later, General Motors would also produce an electric S-10, the Chevrolet S-10 EV, based on the General Motors EV1.

In the early 1990s, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the government of California&#x27;s &quot;clean air agency&quot;, began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to zero-emissions vehicles such as electric vehicles. In response, automakers developed electric models, including the Chrysler TEVan, Ford Ranger EV pickup truck, GM EV1 and S10 EV pickup, Honda EV Plus hatchback, Nissan lithium-battery Altra EV miniwagon and Toyota RAV4 EV. The Altra was notable for being the first production EV to use lithium-ion batteries.

The automakers were accused of pandering to the wishes of CARB in order to continue to be allowed to sell cars in the lucrative Californian market, while failing to adequately promote their electric vehicles in order to create the impression that the consumers were not interested in the cars, all the while joining oil industry lobbyists in vigorously protesting CARB&#x27;s mandate. GM&#x27;s program came under particular scrutiny; in an unusual move, consumers were not allowed to purchase EV1s, but were instead asked to sign closed-end leases, meaning that the cars had to be returned to GM at the end of the lease period, with no option to purchase, despite lease interest in continuing to own the cars. Chrysler, Toyota, and a group of GM dealers sued CARB in Federal court.

After public protests by EV drivers&#x27; groups upset by the repossession of their cars, Toyota offered the last 328 RAV4-EVs for sale to the general public for six months until 22 November 2002. Almost all other production electric cars were withdrawn from the market and were in some cases seen to have been destroyed by their manufacturers. Toyota continues to support the several hundred Toyota RAV4-EVs in the hands of the general public and in fleet usage. GM famously de-activated the few EV1s that were donated to engineering schools and museums.

Throughout the 1990s, interest in fuel-efficient or environmentally friendly cars declined among consumers in the United States, who instead favored sport utility vehicles, which were affordable to operate despite their poor fuel efficiency thanks to lower gasoline prices. Domestic U.S. automakers chose to focus their product lines on truck-based vehicles, which enjoyed larger profit margins than the smaller cars which were preferred in places like Europe or Japan.

Most electric vehicles on the world roads were low-speed, low-range neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs). Pike Research estimated there were almost 479,000 NEVs on world roads in 2011. , there were between 60,000 and 76,000 low-speed battery-powered vehicles in use in the United States, up from about 56,000 in 2004. North America&#x27;s top-selling NEV is the Global Electric Motorcars (GEM) vehicles, with more than 50,000 units sold worldwide by mid-2014. The world&#x27;s two largest NEV markets in 2011 were the United States, with 14,737 units sold, and France, with 2,231 units. Other micro electric cars sold in Europe was the Kewet, since 1991, and replaced by the Buddy, launched in 2008. Also the Th!nk City was launched in 2008 but production was halted due to financial difficulties. Production restarted in Finland in December 2009. The Th!nk was sold in several European countries and the U.S. In June 2011 Think Global filed for bankruptcy and production was halted. Worldwide sales reached 1,045 units by March 2011. A total of 200,000 low-speed small electric cars were sold in China in 2013, most of which are powered by lead-acid batteries. These electric vehicles are not considered by the government as new energy vehicles due to safety and environmental concerns, and consequently, do not enjoy the same benefits as highway legal plug-in electric cars.
==2000s: Modern highway-capable electric cars==

California electric car maker Tesla Motors began development in 2004 on the Tesla Roadster, which was first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first production all-electric car to travel more than per charge. Since 2008, Tesla sold approximately 2,450 Roadsters in over 30 countries through December 2012. Tesla sold the Roadster until early 2012, when its supply of Lotus Elise gliders ran out, as its contract with Lotus Cars for 2,500 gliders expired at the end of 2011. Tesla stopped taking orders for the Roadster in the U.S. market in August 2011, and the 2012 Tesla Roadster was sold in limited numbers only in Europe, Asia and Australia.


The Mitsubishi i-MiEV was launched in Japan for fleet customers in July 2009, and for individual customers in April 2010, followed by sales to the public in Hong Kong in May 2010, and Australia in July 2010 via leasing. The i-MiEV was launched in Europe in December 2010, including a rebadged version sold in Europe as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero. The market launch in the Americas began in Costa Rica in February 2011, followed by Chile in May 2011. Fleet and retail customer deliveries in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2011. Accounting for all vehicles of the iMiEV brand, Mitsubishi reports around 27,200 units sold or exported since 2009 through December 2012, including the minicab MiEVs sold in Japan, and the units rebadged and sold as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero in the European market.

Senior leaders at several large automakers, including Nissan and General Motors, have stated that the Roadster was a catalyst which demonstrated that there is pent-up consumer demand for more efficient vehicles. In an August 2009 edition of The New Yorker, GM vice-chairman Bob Lutz was quoted as saying, &quot;All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us – and boom, along comes Tesla. So I said, &#x27;How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can&#x27;t?&#x27; That was the crowbar that helped break up the log jam.&quot;

==2010s==

The Nissan Leaf, introduced in Japan and the United States in December 2010, became the first modern all-electric, zero tailpipe emission five door family hatchback to be produced for the mass market from a major manufacturer. , the Leaf was also available in Australia, Canada and 17 European countries.

The Better Place network was the first modern commercial deployment of the battery swapping model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first mass production electric car enable with switchable battery technology and sold for the Better Place network in Israel and Denmark. Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The battery exchange process took five minutes. , there were 17 battery switch stations fully operational in Denmark enabling customers to drive anywhere across the country in an electric car. By late 2012 the company began to suffer financial difficulties, and decided to put on hold the roll out in Australia and reduce its non-core activities in North America, as the company decided to concentrate its resources on its two existing markets. On 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel. The company&#x27;s financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark.

The Smart electric drive, Wheego Whip LiFe, Mia electric, Volvo C30 Electric, and the Ford Focus Electric were launched for retail customers during 2011. The BYD e6, released initially for fleet customers in 2010, began retail sales in Shenzhen, China in October 2011. The Bolloré Bluecar was released in December 2011 and deployed for use in the Autolib&#x27; carsharing service in Paris. Leasing to individual and corporate customers began in October 2012 and is limited to the Île-de-France area. In February 2011, the Mitsubishi i MiEV became the first electric car to sell more than 10,000 units, including the models badged in Europe as Citroën C-Zero and Peugeot. The record was officially registered by Guinness World Records. Several months later, the Nissan Leaf overtook the i MiEV as the best selling all-electric car ever, and by February 2013 global sales of the Leaf reached the 50,000 unit mark.

The next Tesla vehicle, the Model S, was released in the U.S. on 22 June 2012 and the first delivery of a Model S to a retail customer in Europe took place on 7 August 2013. Deliveries in China began on 22 April 2014. The next model was the Tesla Model X. Other models released to the market in 2012 and 2013 include the BMW ActiveE, Coda, Renault Fluence Z.E., Honda Fit EV, Toyota RAV4 EV, Renault Zoe, Roewe E50, Mahindra e2o, Chevrolet Spark EV, Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive, Fiat 500e, Volkswagen e-Up!, BMW i3, and Kandi EV. Toyota released the Scion iQ EV in the U.S. (Toyota eQ in Japan) in 2013. The car production is limited to 100 units. The first 30 units were delivered to the University of California, Irvine in March 2013 for use in its Zero Emission Vehicle-Network Enabled Transport (ZEV-NET) carsharing fleet. Toyota announced that 90 out of the 100 vehicles produced globally will be placed in carsharing demonstration projects in the United States and the rest in Japan.

The Coda sedan went out of production in 2013, after selling only about 100 units in California. Its manufacturer, Coda Automotive, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 1 May 2013. The company stated that it expects to emerge from the bankruptcy process to focus on energy storage solutions as it has decided to abandon car manufacturing.

The Tesla Model S ranked as the top-selling plug-in electric car in North America during the first quarter of 2013 with 4,900 cars sold, ahead of the Nissan Leaf (3,695). European retail deliveries of the Tesla Model S began in Oslo in August 2013, and during its first full month in the market, the Model S ranked as the top-selling car in Norway with 616 units delivered, representing a market share of 5.1% of all the new cars sold in the country in September 2013, becoming the first electric car to top the new car sales ranking in any country, and contributing to a record all-electric car market share of 8.6% of new car sales during that month. In October 2013, an electric car was the best selling car in the country for a second month in a row. This time was the Nissan Leaf with 716 units sold, representing a 5.6% of new car sales that month.

The Renault–Nissan Alliance reached global sales of 100,000 all-electric vehicles in July 2013. The 100,000th customer was a U.S. student who bought a Nissan Leaf.

Global sales of the Tesla Model X passed the 10,000 unit mark in August 2016, with most cars delivered in the United States.

Cumulative global sales of pure electric passenger cars and utility vans passed the 1 million unit milestone in September 2016. Global sales of the Tesla Model S achieved the 150,000 unit milestone in November 2016, four years and five months after its introduction, and just five more months than it took the Nissan Leaf to achieve the same milestone. Norway achieved the milestone of 100,000 all-electric vehicles registered in December 2016. Retail deliveries of the Chevrolet Bolt EV began in the San Francisco Bay Area on 13 December 2016. In December 2016, Nissan reported that Leaf owners worldwide achieved the milestone of driven collectively through November 2016, saving the equivalent of nearly of emissions. Global Nissan Leaf sales passed 250,000 units delivered in December 2016. The Tesla Model S was the world&#x27;s best-selling plug-in electric car in 2016 for the second year running, with 50,931 units delivered globally.

In December 2016, Norway became the first country where 5% of all registered passenger cars were plug-in electric cars. When new car sales in Norway are categorised by powertrain or fuel, nine of the top ten best-selling models in 2016 were electric-drive models. The Norwegian electric-drive segment achieved a combined market share of 40.2% of new passenger car sales in 2016, consisting of 15.7% for all-electric cars, 13.4% for plug-in hybrids, and 11.2% for conventional hybris. A record monthly market share for the plug-in electric passenger segment in any country was achieved in Norway in January 2017 with 37.5% of new car sales; the plug-in hybrid segment reached a 20.0% market share of new passenger cars, and the all-electric car segment had a 17.5% market share. Also in January 2017, the electrified passenger car segment, consisting of plug-in hybrids, all-electric cars and conventional hybrids, for the first time ever surpassed combined sales of cars with a conventional diesel or gasoline engine, with a market share of 51.4% of new car sales that month. For many years Norwegian electric vehicles have been subsidised by approximately 50%, and have several other benefits, such as use of bus lanes and free parking. Many of these perks have been extended to 2020.

In February 2017 Consumer Reports named Tesla as the top car brand in the United States and ranked it 8th among global carmakers. Deliveries of the Tesla Model S passed the 200,000 unit milestone during the fourth quarter of 2017. Global sales of the Nissan Leaf achieved the 300,000 unit milestone in January 2018.

In September 2018, the Norwegian market share of all-electric cars reached 45.3% and plug-in hybrids 14.9%, for a combined market share of the plug-in car segment of 60.2% of new car registrations that month, becoming the world&#x27;s highest-ever monthly market share for the plug-in electric passenger segment in Norway and in any country. Accounting for conventional hybrids, the electrified segment achieved an all-time record 71.5% market share in September 2018. In October 2018, Norway became the first country where 1 in every 10 passenger cars registered is a plug-in electric vehicle. Norway ended 2018 with plug-in market share of 49.1%, meaning that every second new passenger car sold in the country in 2018 was a plug-in electric. The market share for the all-electric segment was 31.2% in 2018.

Tesla delivered its 100,000th Model 3 in October 2018. U.S. sales of the Model 3 reached the 100,000 unit milestone in November 2018, quicker than any previous model sold in the country. The Model 3 was the top-selling plug-in electric car in the U.S. for 12 consecutive months since January 2018, ending 2018 as the best-selling plug-in with an estimated all-time record of 139,782 units delivered, the first time a plug-in car sold more than 100 thousand units in a single year. In 2018, for the first time in any country, an all-electric car topped annual sales of the passenger car segment. The Nissan Leaf was Norway&#x27;s best selling new passenger car model in 2018. The Tesla Model 3 listed as the world&#x27;s best selling plug-in electric car in 2018.

In January 2019, with 148,046 units sold since inception in the American market, the Model 3 overtook the Model S to become the all-time best selling all-electric car in the U.S. Until 2019, the Nissan Leaf was the world&#x27;s all-time top-selling highway legal electric car, with global sales of 450,000 units through December 2019. The Tesla Model 3 ended 2019 as the world&#x27;s best selling plug-in electric car for the second consecutive year, with just over 300,000 units delivered. Also, the Model 3 topped the annual list of best selling passenger car models in the overall market in two countries, Norway and the Netherlands.

The global stock of plug-in electric passenger cars reached 5.1 million units in December 2018, consisting of 3.3 million all-electric cars (65%) and 1.8 million plug-in hybrid cars (35%). The global ratio between BEVs and PHEVs has been shifting towards fully electric cars, it went from 56:44 in 2012 to 60:40 in 2015, and rose from 69:31 in 2018 to 74:26 in 2019. Despite the rapid growth experienced, the plug-in electric car segment represented just about 1 out of every 250 motor vehicles on the world&#x27;s roads at the end of 2018. 
==2020s==

The Tesla Model 3 surpassed the Nissan Leaf in early 2020 to become the world&#x27;s best selling electric car ever, with more than 500,000 total units sold by March 2020. However, the Tesla Model Y is the bestselling electric vehicle in terms of yearly units. Tesla also became the first auto manufacturer to produce 1 million electric cars in March 2020. Global sales of the Model 3 passed the 1 million milestone in June 2021, the first electric car model to do so. However, later in May 2023, the Model Y became the world&#x27;s best selling vehicle in Q1.

The Nissan Leaf achieved the milestone of 500,000 units sold globally in early December 2020, 10 years after its inception. Combined sales of plug-in electric cars and light-duty commercial vans since 2010 achieved the 10 million unit milestone by the end of 2020. Just a year and a half later, the combined sales doubled to 20 million in June 2022.

== Electric bicycle ==

The principal manufacturer of e-bikes globally is China, with 2009 seeing the manufacturing of 22.2 million units. In the world Geoby is the leading manufacturers of E-bikes. Pedego is the best selling in the U.S.
China accounts for nearly 92% of the market worldwide. In China the number of electric bicycles on the road was 120 million in 2010. Jiangsu Yadea, an electric bicycle producer of renown in China, leads the ranking of China National Light Industry Council (CNLIC) electric bicycle industry for three years. It retains capacity of nearly 6 million electric bicycles a year.

In 1997, Charger Electric Bicycle was the first U.S. company to come out with a pedelec.

First models of electric bicycles appeared in late 19th century. US Patent office registered several e-bike patents since 1895 to 1899 (Ogden Bolton patented battery-powered bicycle in 1895, Hosea W. Libbey patented bicycle with double electric motor in 1897 and John Schnepf patented electric motor with roller wheel).

<doc id="951198" wikidata="Q1128219" url="?curid=951198" title="Men's FIH Hockey World Cup">
<text>The Men&#x27;s FIH Hockey World Cup is an international field hockey competition organised by the International Hockey Federation. The tournament was started in 1971. It is held every four years, bridging the four years between the Summer Olympics. Pakistan is the most successful team, having won the tournament four times. The Netherlands, Australia, and Germany have each won three titles. Belgium and India have both won the tournament once.

The 2023 tournament was held in Bhubaneswar, India from 13 to 29 January. Germany defeated Belgium in a penalty shoot-out 5–4 after the match ended in a 3–3 draw to win their third World Cup title. The World Cup expanded to 16 teams in 2018.

==History==
The Hockey World Cup was first conceived by Pakistan&#x27;s Air Marshal Nur Khan. He proposed his idea to the FIH through Patrick Rowley, the first editor of &quot;World Hockey&quot; magazine. Their idea was approved on 26 October 1969 and adopted by the FIH Council at a meeting in Brussels on 12 April 1970. The FIH decided that the inaugural World Cup would be held in October 1971, in Pakistan.

However, political issues would prevent that first competition from being played in Pakistan. The FIH had inadvertently scheduled the first World Cup to be played in Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Furthermore, Pakistan and India had been at war with each other only six years earlier. When Pakistan invited India to compete in the tournament, a crisis arose. Pakistanis, led by cricketer Abdul Hafeez Kardar, protested against India&#x27;s participation in the Hockey World Cup.

Given the intense political climate between Pakistan and India, the FIH decided to move the tournament elsewhere. In March 1971, coincidentally in the same month Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan, the FIH decided to move the first Hockey World Cup to the Real Club de Polo grounds in Barcelona, Spain, which was considered a neutral and peaceful European site.

The FIH has set no requirements or limitations on the size of the competition. The 1971 Cup included only ten nations, the smallest World Cup. The 1978 Cup featured fourteen nations. The 2002, 2018 and 2023 Cups featured sixteen nations. The remaining 10 World Cups have featured 12 nations.

The first three tournaments were held every two years. The 1978 Cup was the only tournament held three years from the previous one. It was halfway between the Summer Olympics hockey competition and has continued that way. In other words, the tournament has been held every four years ever since.

==Trophy==
The Hockey World Cup trophy was designed by the Bashir Moojid and created by the Pakistani Army. On 27 March 1971, in Brussels, the trophy was formally handed to FIH President Rene Frank by Mr H.E Masood, the Pakistani Ambassador to Belgium. The trophy consists of a silver cup with an intricate floral design, surmounted by a globe of the world in silver and gold, placed on a high blade base inlaid with ivory. At its peak is a model hockey stick and ball. Without its base, the trophy stands high. Including the base, the trophy stands . It weighs , including of gold, of silver, of ivory and of teak.

==Format==
The Hockey World Cup consists of a qualification stage and a final tournament stage. The format for each stage is the same.

===Qualification===
The qualification stage has been a part of the Hockey World Cup since 1977. All participating teams play in the qualification round. The teams divide into two or more pools and compete for a berth in the final tournament. The top two teams are automatically qualified and the rest of the berths are decided in playoffs.

===Final tournament===
The final tournament features the continental champions and other qualified teams. Sometimes it also features the winners of the Summer Olympics&#x27; hockey competition or the continental runners-up. The teams divide into pools once more and play a round robin tournament. The composition of the pools is determined using the current FIH World Rankings.

==Results==
===Summaries===
===Successful national teams===
Twenty seven teams have qualified for a Hockey World Cup. Of these, thirteen teams have made it to the semifinals. Eight teams have made it through to the finals.

To date, the most successful teams are Pakistan, with four titles from six final appearances, the Netherlands, with three titles from seven final appearances, Germany and Australia with three titles from five final appearances, while India and Belgium won their lone titles in 1975 and 2018, respectively.

Below is a list of teams that have finished in the top four positions in the tournament:
:* = &quot;host country&quot;
:^ = &quot;includes results representing West Germany between 1971 and 1990&quot;
:# = &quot;states that have since split into two or more independent countries&quot;

===Performance by host nations===
Nine nations have hosted the Hockey World Cup. Only the Netherlands (1973 and 1998) and Germany (2006) have won the tournament as hosts. Spain, England, and Pakistan emerged as host runners-up in the 1971, 1986 and 1990 tournaments. Australia placed third when it hosted the 1994 tournament in Sydney.

===Performance by continental zones===
To date, the finals of the Hockey World Cup have been contested by Asian, European and Oceania continental teams. European teams have won the most with six titles, followed by Asian teams with five titles. Australia is the only team from Oceania to win the tournament. Neither the Americas nor Africa have ever won the title.
==Team appearances==

:^ = &quot;includes results representing West Germany between 1971 and 1990&quot;
:# = &quot;states that have since split into two or more independent nations&quot;

Germany, India, the Netherlands and Spain are the only teams to have competed at each World Cup; 27 teams have competed in at least one World Cup.

==Debut of teams==
:&quot;^ = Germany is a successor of West Germany and not a separate team.&quot;
:&quot;# = Belarus was a part of Soviet Union but not successor, hence Belarus is a new separate entity.&quot;

Total number of teams which have participated in the World Cups through 2018 is 25, using FIH&#x27;s view on successor teams

<text>WTDY-FM (96.5 MHz) is a commercial radio station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Audacy, Inc. and broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format. WTDY-FM features programming from Premiere Networks.

WTDY-FM&#x27;s studios are co-located with located within Audacy&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Center City, Philadelphia, while its transmitter is situated off Domino Lane in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia, a site where other local FM and TV towers are located.

==History==
===1945-1958: Early years===
Independence Broadcasting Company, the owners of WHAT (1340 AM), applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a construction permit for a new FM station on 103.5 MHz on October 5, 1945. The FCC granted the permit on July 10, 1947, while reassigning the station to 105.3 MHz. The FCC granted permission on December 2, 1948, for the station to begin broadcasting, by which time it had been assigned the WHAT-FM call sign.

In 1956, a young disc jockey known as Sid Mark took the airwaves for the first time in Philadelphia on WHAT-AM-FM, beginning a multi-decade career.

On July 24, 1957, Independence Broadcasting applied to the FCC for a construction permit to change the station&#x27;s frequency to 96.5 MHz. The FCC granted the permit on October 30, 1957, followed by a new license effective September 26, 1958.

===1958-1975: Jazz===
WHAT-FM became a full-time jazz station in 1958, the first of its kind on the FM dial. On November 18, 1968, the call sign was changed to WWDB, referring to the brother and sister owners of the station, William and Dolly Banks. In the early 1970s, WWDB experimented with playing adult contemporary music, but eventually went back to jazz.

===1975-2000: Talk===
In 1975, the station&#x27;s format was changed to all talk, making WWDB the first full-time talk station in the United States that was exclusively on the FM dial. On-air talk personalities included Irv Homer, Bernie McCain, Frank Ford, Phil Valentine, Tom Marr, and Bernie Herman. The station called itself &quot;WWDB, The Talk Station&quot;. Originally, the station carried no syndicated shows, but came to air the syndicated Rush Limbaugh Show in the early 1990s. Nearly all twenty-four hours a day of talk radio programming with local and national news updates, came from the WWDB programming staff. Meanwhile, WHAT continued on as one of Philadelphia&#x27;s radio stations aimed at the local African-American community.

After her brother William died in 1979, Dolly Banks took over as general manager. William Banks had no children, so several distant relatives filed lawsuits, fighting for ownership of twin stations WWDB/WHAT. In 1985, Dolly Banks retired after the African-American employees of sister station WHAT, along with the Black Media Caucus in Washington, D.C., sued the estate, receiving millions of dollars and forcing an estate sale of WWDB. The sale, which was overseen by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), required the stations to be sold to a Black owner. WWDB was sold to Ragan Henry, a Black Philadelphia attorney, for an undervalued amount of $6 million. Henry&#x27;s law firm had worked for the Banks family. Irv Homer had to testify before the FCC.

After a few months of ownership, in 1986, Regan Henry flipped WWDB, selling it to the decidedly not Black Charles Schwartz, who ran it under the name of Panache Broadcasting. Ten years later, Mercury Broadcasting purchased WWDB for $48 million.

After having been nearly 100% local programming, WWDB under Mercury ownership, added more nationally syndicated personalities such as Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura.

===2000-2003: 1980s hits===
Beasley Broadcasting of Florida purchased WWDB for $65 million from Mercury Broadcasting in 1997. At first, Beasley said that the talk format would continue, but the high salaries earned by the veteran talk hosts became an expense the new owners did not want to pay. To earn extra money, the station began airing extended infomercials. After lawsuits filed by the Gay Alliance of Philadelphia, Beasley decided to change the format with no notice given ahead of time. On November 3, 2000, Beasley registered the new call sign WPTP for the station. At 9 a.m. on November 6, the day before the U.S. Presidential Election, the station began stunting with Microsoft Mary&#x27;s computer-generated voice counting down to 5 p.m. that day.

At that time, WWDB&#x27;s format was changed to 1980s hits, branded as &quot;96-5 The Point&quot;. The first song was &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; by Simple Minds. The buyout of the WWDB hosts&#x27; contracts is said to have cost Beasley $5 million. The WPTP call sign went into effect on November 22, 2000. Due to low ratings, WPTP shifted to hot adult contemporary in early 2003. The format tweak did little to improve the station&#x27;s ratings. (WPTP&#x27;s closest rival with the format, WMWX, also had low ratings during this time.)

===2003-2015: Rhythmic Contemporary===
On November 17, 2003, at 7:50 am, WPTP began stunting with Christmas music as &quot;Snowy 96.5&quot;. At 5 p.m. that day, after a bit with then-morning host Paul Barsky, WPTP changed to rhythmic contemporary as &quot;Wild 96.5&quot;, and changed call signs to WLDW. The station launched with &quot;Get Low&quot; by Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz; however, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), owners of the copyrighted &quot;Wild&quot; moniker, threatened Beasley with a lawsuit for copyright infringement. To avoid this, in February 2004, WLDW became &quot;Wired 96.5&quot; and the call sign changed to WRDW-FM. (The -FM suffix was necessary because of the existence of AM station WRDW in Augusta, Georgia, which was also owned by Beasley.)

During its tenure as &quot;Wired&quot;, the station would occasionally shift back and forth between Rhythmic and Mainstream Top 40, while still placing an emphasis on Rhythmic and Dance currents/recurrents, and avoiding most rock-leaning product.

On October 2, 2014, Beasley Broadcast Group announced that it would trade five radio stations located in Miami and Philadelphia (including WRDW-FM) to CBS Radio in exchange for 14 stations located in Tampa and Charlotte. Because CBS already owned two AM stations in Philadelphia, Beasley would acquire WIP, which today is WTEL. The swap was completed on December 1, 2014. Shortly after the trade was consummated, WRDW-FM shifted to a more Mainstream Top 40 direction, though still favoring Rhythmic and Dance currents/recurrents.

===2015-2017: Top 40===
During and after the trade, rumors abounded online that CBS would flip the station to all-news, this time as a simulcast of KYW. This was partially due to WRDW-FM&#x27;s continued low ratings; in the February 2015 Philadelphia PPM ratings report, WRDW-FM held a 2.4 share of the market, as compared to direct competitor WIOQ&#x27;s 4.1 share. In the spring of 2015, CBS registered domain names towards a possible rebranding as &quot;96.5 AMP Radio&quot;, joining similar stations in New York, Detroit, Boston, Orlando and Los Angeles with the &quot;AMP&quot; name. On April 5, 2015, WRDW-FM began running without airstaff and promoting a significant change using the hashtag #965Friday5PM to come at 5 p.m. on April 10. At that time, after playing &quot;Motownphilly&quot; by Boyz II Men, the rebrand to &quot;AMP Radio&quot; took place. The first song on &quot;AMP&quot; was &quot;Get Low&quot; by Dillon Francis and DJ Snake. The changeover also resulted in morning host Chunky and afternoon host/program director Buster being released. On April 20, 2015, WRDW-FM changed its call sign to WZMP to match the &quot;AMP&quot; moniker.

During its tenure as &quot;AMP&quot;, the station&#x27;s ratings improved, mostly to a low to mid-3 share of the market, but did not dethrone WIOQ. In the December 2016 Philadelphia PPM ratings report, WZMP held a 3.0 share as compared to WIOQ&#x27;s 3.6 share. Around Christmas of 2016, morning host Jason Cage and afternoon host Mike Adam left the station.

===2017-2018: Adult contemporary===

On January 5, 2017, at 10 am, after playing &quot;Time of Our Lives&quot; by Pitbull, WZMP flipped to mainstream adult contemporary as &quot;Today&#x27;s 96.5&quot;, launching with &quot;Raise Your Glass&quot; by Doylestown native P!nk. At launch, the new format would compete against market leader WBEB, as well as hot-AC formatted WISX. (WISX suffered low ratings against the newly formatted WZMP later in the year, leading WISX to make a format switch to rhythmic AC five months later.) On January 13, 2017, WZMP changed its call sign to WTDY-FM to better match the new format.

On February 2, 2017, CBS announced that it would merge its radio division (which included WTDY-FM) with Bala Cynwyd-based Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.

===2018–present: Hot AC; return to CHR, and return to Hot AC===
On March 16, 2018, the station rebranded as &quot;96.5 TDY&quot;, shifting to a hot adult contemporary format with a larger emphasis on current music. The switch also restored a hot AC-formatted station to the market for the first time since WISX&#x27;s aforementioned flip, and returned the format to the 96.5 frequency since the flip to rhythmic in 2003.

On November 12, 2018, WTDY-FM launched a new morning show, &quot;Coop &amp; Casey in the Morning&quot;, hosted by Sean &#x27;Coop&#x27; Tabler and Casey Reed. The station also shifted back to a Top 40/CHR format, a move that followed Entercom&#x27;s acquisition of former AC competitor WBEB.

In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and cost cutting measures, Casey Reed of &quot;Coop &amp; Casey in the Morning&quot; was let go, with longtime radio and morning show host Sean &quot;Coop&quot; Tabler remaining.

For the weekend of May 11 through 15, 2023, the station temporarily rebranded as &quot;96.5 TAY&quot; (pronounced &quot;Ninety-Swift-Five T-A-Y&quot;), playing only music by Taylor Swift ahead of her Eras Tour stopping in Philadelphia for that period, promoting that the station would broadcast on site from her performances at Lincoln Financial Field. WTDY-FM also began running sweepers announcing that at 9 a.m. on May 15, &quot;96.5 will begin a new era.&quot; At that date and time, WTDY-FM shifted back to hot adult contemporary and re-branded as &quot;The New 96.5&quot;, with &quot;I&#x27;m Good (Blue)&quot; by David Guetta and Bebe Rexha being the first song played.

==HD Radio==
===WTDY-FM HD2===
In 2007, WRDW added an HD2 subchannel, carrying non-stop dance music under the moniker &quot;Hot Wired&quot;. The music and imaging was similar to co-owned Miami rhythmic station WPOW&#x27;s HD2 channel, now defunct. In 2012, the format changed to foreign language programming as &quot;VDC Radio&quot;. In May 2013, Hot Wired returned, while VDC moved to WXTU-HD3. &quot;Hot Wired&quot; was later renamed &quot;WirEDM&quot;, referring to Electronic Dance Music. In 2015, the WirEDM name was phased out with the rebranding to AMP Radio, with the HD2 subchannel rebranding as &quot;Pulse&quot;. The format aired mainly dance music from 2005 to 2012 with a few current songs in the mix. In November 2017, the HD2 format flipped to acoustic rock with a few alternative songs mixed in as &quot;Alt 96.5 HD2&quot;. Roughly a year later, the format was shifted to a more traditional alternative rock playlist. The HD3 format soon moved over to HD2.

===WTDY-FM HD3===
In September 2015, WTDY-HD3 aired &quot;Popecast&quot;, a temporary station produced by KYW to cover Pope Francis&#x27;s visit to North America (which concluded in Philadelphia).

In August 2019, WTDY-HD3 began airing programming from &quot;Channel Q&quot;, Entercom&#x27;s Talk/EDM service for the LGBTQ community. Previously, it aired a travelers&#x27; information loop as &quot;Hear Philly&quot;. The HD3 subchannel has moved to HD2 and has since been turned off.

<text>The Beechcraft L-23 Seminole (later designated U-8) was the United States Armed Forces designation for the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza and Queen Air aircraft in its inventory.

==Design and development==

In 1951 the United States Army evaluated a Model 50 Twin Bonanza at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and subsequently ordered four off-the-shelf Model 50s as YL-23s, these being delivered in early 1952. Further examples of the Model 50 were ordered under the designation L-23A and Model B50s were also ordered under the designation L-23B. These accounted for the majority of Twin Bonanza production during 1952 and 1953, the first L-23A being delivered in February 1953 and the last L-23B being delivered in April the following year, shortly before the end of the Korean War.

In 1955 the United States Air Force ordered a single Model C50 Twin Bonanza under the designation XL-23C for evaluation; this was the only L-23 variant not delivered to the US Army as no further orders were placed by the Air Force. In 1956 deliveries of L-23s to the Army recommenced when Beechcraft delivered six Model D50s under the designation L-23E. In January 1957 the first example of the L-23D was delivered, based on the Model E50 Twin Bonanza. 

During 1958 the remaining L-23A and L-23B aircraft in service (a few had crashed) were returned to the Beechcraft factory, where they were remanufactured to a similar standard as new-build L-23Ds and then re-designated as such with new constructor&#x27;s numbers and military serial numbers. In 1958 the Army also ordered 11 RL-23Ds with further examples being converted from L-23Ds. These aircraft featured belly-mounted radar, either AN/APS-85 in a large pod or AN/APQ-86 in a long narrow pod mounted on brackets with a modified nose as well.

Also in 1958 Beechcraft began to develop a variant with a larger cabin at the request of the US Army. The L-23F that emerged had the same wings and tail but up to ten people could now fit in the longer, wider and higher cabin compared to only five in earlier L-23s. Beechcraft gave the type the in-house designation of Model 65 and developed it as a civilian aircraft as well, christening it the &quot;Queen Air&quot;. The first two Model 65s built were retained by Beechcraft as prototypes and the third was delivered to the Army in 1960, with a further 23 being delivered that year and in 1961.

==Operational history==

The first L-23As entered service in 1953 and the type served the US Army for almost forty years, the last U-8Fs being retired in 1992. When US military aircraft designations were revised in 1962, the remaining L-23D, RL-23D, L-23E and L-23F aircraft became U-8Ds, RU-8Ds, U-8Es and U-8Fs. A further 47 Model 65s were ordered in 1962 and 1963 as U-8Fs; one of these was delivered to the Pakistan Army, formally the only L-23 or U-8 delivery to a foreign user (although other nations bought Queen Airs off-the-shelf as military aircraft). These were the final new-build aircraft in the series, however the unique Beechcraft Model 87 turboprop proof-of-concept aircraft used in developing the King Air was delivered to the Army as the NU-8F in 1964 (this was later re-designated the YU-21) and a few used Queen Airs were also taken by the Army. 

Many U-8Fs were modified during their service lives to a similar standard as civilian Excalibur Queen Airs. The most obvious modifications are more powerful Lycoming IO-720 eight-cylinder engines in place of the factory-fitted six-cylinder engines; and bulged main landing gear doors that fully enclose the wheels when the gear is retracted instead of the wheels partially protruding through the doors. Many L-23Ds/U-8Ds and U-8Fs have been registered as civilian aircraft since retirement from military service.

<text>A helicopter bucket or helibucket is a specialized bucket suspended on a cable carried by a helicopter to deliver water for aerial firefighting. The design of the buckets allows the helicopter to hover over a water source—such as a lake, river, pond, or tank—and lower the bucket into the water to refill it. This allows the helicopter crew to operate the bucket in remote locations without the need to return to a permanent operating base, reducing the time between successive drops.

Each bucket has a release valve on the bottom which is controlled by the helicopter crew. When the helicopter is in position, the crew releases the water to extinguish or suppress the fire below. Each release of the water is referred to as a drop.

==Design==

Buckets can be collapsible or rigid and vary in capacity from . The size of each bucket is determined by the lifting capacity of the helicopter required to utilise each version. Some buckets can include fire retardant foam or the ability to pump water from the bucket into an internal tank. Smaller collapsible buckets can use water sources as shallow as . Worldwide, the term &quot;monsoon bucket&quot; is widely used and accepted as a generic term. In the United States, this type of bucket is officially referred to as a &quot;helibucket&quot;. The trademarked &quot;Bambi Bucket&quot; is also commonly used informally by firefighting crews to describe buckets developed by other manufacturers.

== Variants ==
A number of companies produce buckets, including A-Flex Technology, SEI Industries, IMSNZ Ltd., Absolute Fire Solutions, Rural Fire Service, and Aerial Fire Control Pty. Kawak Aviation Technologies,

<text>Wilson Greatbatch (September 6, 1919 – September 27, 2011) was an American engineer and pioneering inventor. He held more than 325 patents and was a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame and a recipient of the Lemelson–MIT Prize and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation (1990).

== Early years ==

Greatbatch was born in Buffalo, New York and attended public grade school at West Seneca High School. He entered military service and served during World War II, becoming an aviation chief radioman before receiving an honorable discharge in 1945. He attended Cornell University as part of the GI Bill, graduating with a B.E.E. in electrical engineering in 1950; he received a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Buffalo in 1957. Wilson loved fiddling with objects and this would lead to great things.

== The Chardack-Greatbatch pacemaker ==

The &quot;Chardack-Greatbatch&quot; pacemaker used Mallory mercuric oxide-zinc cells (mercury battery) for its energy source, driving a two transistor, transformer coupled blocking oscillator circuit, all encapsulated in epoxy resin, then coupled to electrodes placed into the myocardium of the patient&#x27;s heart. This patented innovation led to the Medtronic company of Minneapolis commencing manufacture and further development of artificial cardiac pacemakers.

== The Greatbatch lithium-iodide battery cell ==

In 1968, Catalyst Research Corporation of Baltimore, Maryland developed and patented a lithium battery cell . The cell used two elements at near ends of the electrochemical scale, causing a high voltage of 2.8V and an energy density near the physical maximum. Unfortunately, it had an internal impedance which limited its current load to under 0.1 mA and was thus considered useless.

Greatbatch sought to introduce this invention into the pacemaker industry, which could readily use a high impedance battery. The early work was conducted in a rented area of the former Wurlitzer Organ Factory in North Tonawanda, New York. Ralph Mead is understood to have headed the early electrochemical development.

Greatbatch introduced the developed &quot;WG1&quot; cell to pacemaker developers in 1971, and was met with limited enthusiasm. On July 9, 1974, Manuel A. Villafaña and Anthony Adducci founders of Cardiac Pacemakers Inc.(Guidant) in St. Paul, Minnesota, manufactured the world&#x27;s first pacemaker with a lithium anode and a lithium-iodide electrolyte solid-state battery. The lithium-iodide cell manufactured by Greatbatch is now the standard cell for pacemakers, having the energy density, low self-discharge, small size and reliability needed.

In the cell as developed for cardiac pacemaker application, the anode is lithium and the cathode a proprietary composition of iodine and poly-2-vinylpyridine, neither of which is electrically conductive. However, after processing by mixing and heating to ~ 150 °C for 72 hours the components react with each other to form an electrically conductive viscous liquid which, while still molten, is poured into the cell where it cools to form a solid. When the liquid contacts the lithium anode it creates a monomolecular layer of semiconducting crystalline lithium iodide. As the cell is discharged by the current load of the pacemaker, the reaction between the lithium anode and iodine cathode forms a growing barrier of lithium iodide, This is resistive, and causes the terminal voltage of the cell to decrease approximately as an inverse function of the volume of the barrier. Pacemaker designers use this characteristic to permit detection of incipient &#x27;end of life&#x27; of the pacemaker&#x27;s lithium cell.

== Philanthropy ==

Greatbatch donated funds to Houghton College in New York to create a graduate program in music. The Houghton College Center for the Arts (CFA) was designed with his donations to include a concert hall, art gallery, multi-floor gathering space, and various choir and instrumental practice rooms. It was subsequently named the Greatbatch School of Music after him. Houghton College assisted Greatbatch in his research, when he was unable to generate support, providing him with lab space and research assistance.

In 2009, Wilson and Eleanor Greatbatch donated approximately $10 million to create a modern glass reception and interpretive pavilion, called the &quot;Eleanor and Wilson Greatbatch Pavilion&quot;, separate from the Darwin D. Martin House Complex. It was designed by Toshiko Mori, chair of the department of architecture at Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Design.

== Death ==

Wilson Greatbatch died at the age of 92 on September 27, 2011.
Greatbatch served as an elder at Clarence Presbyterian Church, where he also sang in the church choir and taught Sunday school.

<text>A day school — as opposed to a boarding school — is an educational institution where children are given instruction during the day, after which the students return to their homes. A day school has full-day programs when compared to a regular school which may end early and require additional after-school programs for students with working parents. Day schools also generally offer supervised lunches, which is required for children with working parents, and in locations where children are not expected to return home at noon to eat with their families.

<doc id="951260" wikidata="Q355481" url="?curid=951260" title="Erskine Hawkins">
<text>Erskine Ramsay Hawkins (July 26, 1914 – November 11, 1993) was an American trumpeter and big band leader from Birmingham, Alabama, dubbed &quot;The 20th Century Gabriel&quot;. He is best remembered for composing the jazz standard &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot; (1939) with saxophonist and arranger Bill Johnson. The song became a hit during World War II, rising to No. 7 nationally (version by the Erskine Hawkins Orchestra) and to No. 1 nationally (version by the Glenn Miller Orchestra). Vocalists who were featured with Erskine&#x27;s orchestra include Ida James, Delores Brown, and Della Reese. Hawkins was named after Alabama industrialist Erskine Ramsay.

==Early years==
Erskine Hawkins was named by his parents after Alabama industrialist Erskine Ramsay who was rewarding parents with savings accounts for them for doing so. Hawkins attended Councill Elementary School and Industrial High School (now known as Parker High School) in Birmingham, Alabama. At Industrial High School, he played in the band directed by Fess Whatley, a teacher who taught many African-American musicians, many of whom worked with such musicians as Duke Ellington, Lucky Millinder, Louis Armstrong and Skitch Henderson (of the NBC Orchestra).

==Headliner years==
During 1936 through 1938, Hawkins recorded for Vocalion Records as &quot;Erskine Hawkins and his &#x27;Bama State Collegians&quot;. In 1938, he signed with RCA Victor and began recording on their Bluebird label as, simply, &quot;Erskine Hawkins and His Orchestra&quot;.

In the late 1930s, Hawkins and his Orchestra were one of the house bands at the Savoy Ballroom. They alternated with the Chick Webb band, and often used &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot; as their sign-off song before the next band would take the stage, so that the dancing would continue uninterrupted. Hawkins also engaged in &quot;battles of the bands&quot; with such bandleaders as Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, and Lionel Hampton.

In 1943, a Hawkins concert caused trouble in Little Rock, Arkansas: &quot;3,000 Negroes jammed into the Exhibition Hall to dance to the music of Hawkins and his crew became unruly and began to push white police all over the floor. Police brandished their guns and blackjacks and attempted to quiet the crowd--but only after Hawkins and his boys broke into the national anthem did the dancers settle down.&quot; A city &quot;ban on dances for Negroes&quot; followed the event, meaning that &quot;bookers of Negro orchestras for dances here may just as well take up another profession.&quot;

In the mid 1940s, he was transferred to the main RCA Victor label, recording many of his greatest hits for both labels during this decade. He remained with them until 1950 when he switched over to Coral Records. He continued to record for many years.

==Later years==

Hawkins was trumpeter and band leader in the lobby bar and show nightclub at The Concord Resort Hotel in Kiamesha Lake, New York from 1967 to 1993 with his last performing group Joe Vitale (piano), Dudly Watson (bass), Sonny Rossi (vocals and clarinet), and George Leary (drums). Hawkins died at his home in Willingboro Township, New Jersey, in November 1993, at the age of 79. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery, alongside his sister, in Birmingham, Alabama.

==Personal life==
Flo Hawkins, who appeared in the 1946 film &quot;That Man of Mine&quot;, was his wife. They eventually became estranged and she worked in The Catskills.

==Induction into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame==
In 1978, Erskine Hawkins became one of the first five artists inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. In 1989, he was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. Hawkins was a contemporary of another Birmingham jazz musician, Sun Ra.

<doc id="951269" wikidata="Q4874129" url="?curid=951269" title="Bay Super V">
<text>Beginning in the late 1950s the United States aircraft company Bay Aviation (formerly Oakland Airmotive) produced nine twin-engine conversions of the Beechcraft Bonanza called the Super &quot;V&quot; Bonanza. After production was shifted to Canada in 1962, five more aircraft were built for a total production run of fourteen. The basis of the conversion was the early Model 35 Bonanza with the original small V-tail surfaces. The Super-V competed with Beechcraft&#x27;s own Travel Air twin-engine Bonanza derivative.

==History==
=== Development ===
The Super-V is an extensive conversion of the Beechcraft Model 35 Bonanza. Serial number records indicate the aircraft chosen for conversion range in production dates from 1947 to 1950. The original conversion was developed by David Peterson as the &quot;Skyline Super-V&quot; in 1955–56, assisted by W.D. Johnson, and the rights to the conversion were acquired by Oakland Airmotive on July 2, 1958. Oakland Airmotive became Bay Aviation Services on July 8, 1960. The wing spar was strengthened considerably in the process. The airframe is so different from the original Bonanza that, rather than supplementing the original type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a completely new certificate for the Super-V.

Oakland Airmotive intended to produce converted planes starting in 1960, but never progressed beyond manufacturing and installing Super-V conversion kits on customer-supplied Bonanzas. Ed Gough was the President. FAA type certification was granted in June 1960. Production drawings, bills of material, and other documentation was prepared and there were several conversions in the pipeline. &quot;Flying&quot; magazine published a story on the Super V in October 1960 and the marketing efforts were reaching a peak, with a Super-V (Registration N617B) completing a successful circumnavigation of the globe. The cost of a standard conversion was priced in 1960 at , not including the cost of the donor aircraft.

The Super-V was initially certificated with the carburetor-equipped Lycoming O-360-A1A engines. Although the engines were intended to be fuel-injected, as on David Peterson&#x27;s developmental prototype, the engines on the prototype did not meet FAA approval. As a preliminary first step towards true fuel injection, the O-360-A1C engine was adopted in August 1960, which eliminated the possibility of carburetor icing. The type certificate was later revised to include the A1C engine variant, and flight testing with O-360-A1C engines was not completed until early 1961 at SFO.

The Insul-8 Corporation of San Carlos, California, organized a new aviation division that provided all parts (except engines) for the conversion to the Super-V Aircraft Corporation of San Francisco International Airport. Super-V conversion centers operated under franchise from the Super-V Aircraft Corporation. Tirey L. Ford, Jr., was president of both the Insul-8 Corporation and the Super-V Aircraft Corporation.

===Early accidents===
The sales manager, Kenneth Bellamy, was killed in a crash fifteen miles southeast of Brighton, Colorado, while demonstrating the Super V to a potential buyer, Don Vest, founder of Vest Aircraft Company on September 14, 1960. A crop-duster pilot, John Curry, was also killed in the crash. It was believed that Vest was at the controls of the Super-V at the time of the crash.

The Super-V belonging to Southland Corporation, a distributor for Bay Aviation Services, crashed on August 12, 1961, near Ardmore, Oklahoma, with at least one survivor.

===Shifting production===
It is likely the relatively high cost of the Super-V conversion and competition from the Beechcraft Travel Air, a factory-built twin-engine aircraft of comparable role and size, resulted in low demand for the Super-V. This, coupled with workmanship issues and early crashes, led to the rapid dissolution of Bay Aviation. Bay Aviation became Lawrence Properties in 1962.

Production was transferred to Fleet Aircraft in 1962 with some detail improvements to fulfill existing orders. A separate type certificate was issued for planes manufactured by Fleet in Canada, this time with O-360-A1D engines. The production rights were sold again to Mitchell Aircraft in 1963. The current type certificate holder is KWAD Company.

==Specific aircraft==
The complete Super-V serial number consists of the converted Super-V serial number (in the format SV###) accompanied by the Beech donor plane serial number (D####). Super-V serial numbers were assigned sequentially starting from SV101. Serial numbers as high as SV117 are known to exist; SV101 was later rebuilt into SV116, and SV110 and SV111 were skipped, hence known production is fourteen aircraft. Of the fourteen, nine were built by Bay Aviation (of which five have been destroyed, two still hold current registration, and two have unknown disposition) and five were built by Fleet Aircraft (of which two have been destroyed, one still holds current registration, and two have unknown disposition).

<doc id="951271" wikidata="Q1715770" url="?curid=951271" title="USS Wyoming (SSBN-742)">
<text>USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; (SSBN-742) is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine which has been in commission since 1996. She is the fourth US Navy ship to be named USS &quot;Wyoming&quot;, although it was only the third named after the state of Wyoming.

The contract to build &quot;Wyoming&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 18 October 1989 and her keel was laid down there on 8 August 1991. She was launched on 15 July 1995, sponsored by Mrs. Monika B. Owens, and commissioned on 13 July 1996.

==Service history==
===1990s===
On 26 July 1996, &quot;Wyoming&quot; arrived at Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, Georgia, becoming the ninth submarine to be home-ported there.
===2010s===
On 6 June 2012, &quot;Wyoming&quot; participated in a historic medevac exercise with a Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey making a 12,000 nautical mile flight to collect a stretcher from the submarine.

On 7 January 2018, she arrived at Norfolk Naval Shipyard to begin a 27-month overhaul to include midlife refueling, technological upgrades, and new berthing spaces for enlisted women.

====Shower video scandal====
In 2011, &quot;Wyoming&quot; became one of the first four submarines to take on female officers. During patrols from August to November 2013 and March to June 2014, four women were secretly recorded in the shower changing room, including midshipmen and officers assigned to the boat. Up to twelve male sailors, all petty officers, were implicated, though it is believed that only one of them made the recordings with a smartphone, and then shared them. Of the twelve sailors that were investigated, ten were prosecuted and convicted, with sentences ranging from prison time to reductions in pay.

===2020s===
On 9 October 2020, she completed her 27-month overhaul and returned to Kings Bay, GA.

On 17 September 2021, &quot;Wyoming&quot; conducted a successful, two-missile test flight of unarmed life-extended Trident II (D5LE) missiles on the Eastern Test Range off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. 

&quot;Wyoming&quot; conducted an exchange of command at sea in January 2022. &quot;This regularly scheduled exchange of command at sea demonstrates the continuity and operational flexibility of our sea-based nuclear deterrence operations and our ready, reliable ballistic-submarine force,&quot; said a Navy spokesperson.

On 24 March 2022 &quot;Wyoming&quot; became the first ballistic submarine in US Navy history to complete a deterrent patrol with enlisted females as part of the crew.

<text>USS &quot;West Virginia&quot; (SSBN-736) is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine. She has been in commission since 1990. She is the third U.S. Navy ship to be named for West Virginia, the 35th state, and the 11th of 18 &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;West Virginia&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 21 November 1983 and her keel was laid down there on 24 December 1987. She was launched at Electric Boat in Groton Connecticut on 14 October 1989, sponsored by Mrs. Erma Byrd, wife of United States Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, and commissioned on 20 October 1990, in the dry-dock of the Kings Bay Georgia Submarine Base, with Captain J. R. Harvey in command of the Blue Crew and Captain Donald McDermott in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
&quot;West Virginia&quot; is based at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia.

On 29 December 2008, Captain Daniel Mack, commander of Submarine Squadron 16/20, relieved &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s commanding officer, Commander Charles &quot;Tony&quot; Hill, of command &quot;due to a loss of confidence&quot; in Hill″s ability to command. Captain Stephen Gillespie was assigned as &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s temporary commanding officer.

In September 2010 the approximate 300 Sailors assigned to the two crews that alternate patrols on &quot;West Virginia&quot; merged into one crew of about 110 sailors during the overhaul and refueling, which was done at the Norfolk Navy Shipyard (NNSY) in Portsmouth, Virginia, beginning in early 2011. Commander Adam D. Palmer relieved Commander Steven K. Hall as commanding officer of &quot;West Virginia&quot; during a change of command ceremony 9 September at Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth, Virginia. Commander Joseph W. Coleman relieved Commander Palmer during a change of command ceremony 25 November 2014 at St. Mary&#x27;s Waterfront in St. Mary&#x27;s, Georgia.

On 24 October 2013, &quot;West Virginia&quot; departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard after a thirty-month refuel and overhaul. On 3 November 2013 she returned to her homeport of Kings Bay, Georgia.

On 25 October 2022, &quot;West Virginia&quot; became the first SSBN to dock at remote British territory island of Diego Garcia .
==Community Support==
&quot;West Virginia&quot;″s Blue and Gold crew members regularly return to the state of West Virginia to participate in parades, community service projects and initiatives. West Virginia&#x27;s commissioning crew established a relationship with the West Virginia Children&#x27;s Home (WVCH) in 1990. WVCH Director Carson Markley, who attended the ship&#x27;s commissioning, appreciates the special bond between the ship and the WVCH.

==&quot;West Virginia&quot; in fiction==
*In Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, &quot;West Virginia&quot; is one of several submarines sent to deal with a Japanese invasion of the Northern Mariana Islands. She is used as a &quot;slow-attack&quot; submarine, relying on her stealthiness and her torpedo tubes in combating Japanese forces.
*In one scenario of the History Channel series Doomsday, &quot;West Virginia&quot; and her crew are (briefly) the last surviving remnant of Earth after it is destroyed by a rogue planet, momentarily kept preserved in ocean water sucked off the planet as Earth is ripped apart due to gravitational tidal forces from the rogue planet&#x27;s Roche limit.

<text>USS &quot;Nevada&quot; (SSBN-733) is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine that has been in commission since 1986. She is the fourth ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for Nevada, the 36th state.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Nevada&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 7 January 1981 and her keel was laid down there on 8 August 1983. She was launched on 14 September 1985 sponsored by Mrs. Carol Laxalt, the wife of United States Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, and commissioned on 16 August 1986, with Captain F.W. Rohm in command of the Blue Crew and Captain William Stone in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==

During the night of 1–2 August 2006, &quot;Nevada&quot; was operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca when she snagged and broke the 500-foot (150-metre) towline between the tug &quot;Phyllis Dunlap&quot; and one of two barges carrying empty containers that &quot;Phyllis Dunlap&quot; was towing from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Seattle, Washington. Fiberglass portions of &quot;Nevada&quot;″s sail were damaged, and a second tug had to recover the drifting barge.

In both 2005 and 2006 and again in 2018, &quot;Nevada&quot;″s crew was awarded with the Battle Efficiency Award (Battle &quot;E&quot;). This award is given to the best submarine in its respective submarine squadron and is determined based on performance in inspections for tactical readiness and nuclear reactor safety, among other factors.
In February 2008, &quot;Nevada&quot; entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, Bremerton Site for a regularly scheduled Engineering Refueling Overhaul. The &#x27;Green&#x27; crew worked for nearly 30 months on the refit and refuel until they were separated back to the &#x27;Gold&#x27; and &#x27;Blue&#x27; crews on 21 July 2010 in preparation for workups and sea trials.

&quot;Nevada&quot; was awarded the 2018 Omaha Trophy on 21 August 2019. The Blue and Gold crews received the trophy to recognize their high standards of performance in the command&#x27;s mission areas. The ballistic missile submarine has been regarded as &quot;one of the US Navy&#x27;s most powerful weapons&quot; in 2022.

<text>USS &quot;Alaska&quot; (SSBN-732), is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine which has been in commission since 1986. She is the fourth US Navy ship to be named for the Territory or State of Alaska.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Alaska&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 27 February 1978 and her keel was laid down there on 9 March 1983. She was launched on 12 January 1985, sponsored by Mrs. Catherine Stevens, wife of US Senator Theodore F. Stevens of Alaska; and commissioned on 25 January 1986, with Captain Paul L. Callahan in command of the Blue Crew and Captain Charles J. Chotvacs in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
&quot;Alaska&quot; spent much of 1986 engaged in shakedown training for her two crews and in clearing up the many details that attend a new fleet ballistic missile submarine&#x27;s addition to the Fleet. She operated initially from New London, Connecticut, and Port Canaveral, Florida, but shifted homeport to the Pacific Northwest later in the year, 4 September to 1 October 1986. &quot;Alaska&quot; sailed through the Panama Canal, and visited San Francisco, California, 21–29 September, while en route. She then served with Submarine Squadron 17, Submarine Group 9, at Naval Submarine Base Bangor, Washington. &quot;Alaska&quot; sailed on her first missile deterrent patrol, manned by her Blue Crew, in the Pacific, 7 December 1986 to 19 February 1987. Her Gold Crew carried out Patrol 2, 16 March to 28 May 1987.

She completed an engineered overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, 1 May 2000 to 9 December 2001. The work included a Trident II D5 &quot;backfit&quot; that enabled &quot;Alaska&quot; to fire the improved version of the submarine launched ballistic missile. In addition, the overhaul upgraded her to shoot the Mk 48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) torpedo. &quot;Alaska&quot; had carried out 47 Trident I C4 and 12 Trident II D5 deterrent missile patrols when she sailed from Kitsap for the final time on 8 July 2006. The submarine subsequently completed a 27½-month engineered refueling and overhaul at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia, on 8 March 2009. &quot;Alaska&quot; shifted to Submarine Squadron 20, Submarine Group 10, at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia, on 1 May 2009; she arrived at Kings Bay on 1 April. On 28 April 2010, the Navy announced plans to convert living spaces on &quot;Alaska&quot; to accommodate female crewmembers.

==Awards==
&quot;Alaska&quot; was awarded the Navy Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; (&quot;Battle E&quot;) award for 2004, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2021 as the most efficient unit in her squadron. She also received the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Omaha Trophy for 2005, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2021. The Omaha Trophy reflects the ability of an SSBN to execute its primary mission, emphasizing strategic deterrence and its evolving role in global operations.

Alaska was recognized with the Meritorious Unit Commendation for meritorious service from Oct. 2011 to Dec. 2013 during which the ship maintained superior weapons, navigation, and communications readiness, providing an invaluable asset for the strategic forces of the United States.

Alaska was recognized with the Meritorious Unit Commendation for meritorious service from 2016 to 2018 during which the ship maintained superior weapons, navigation, and communications readiness, providing an invaluable asset for the strategic forces of the United States.

Additionally, she was awarded the 2014 Battenberg Cup as the best ship or submarine in the Atlantic fleet. She is the first ballistic missile submarine in history to win the award.

<text>The UTVA Aero 3 was a piston-engined military trainer aircraft built in Yugoslavia to replace the Ikarus Aero 2 then in service. One hundred ten were built, in Yugoslav Air Force service from 1958 to mid-1970s. It was superseded by the UTVA 75.

==Design and development==
First flown in 1956, the Aero 3 was designed to meet a Yugoslav Air Force requirement for a primary trainer that could also be used in the army co-operation role.

The Aero 3 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane that seated the student and instructor in tandem under a bubble canopy. Of all wood construction, it had a fixed, tailwheel landing gear and was powered by a nose-mounted 190 hp (142 kW) Lycoming O-435-A piston engine.

<text>Portable Media Center (PMC) is a portable media player (PMP) platform developed by Microsoft. Announced at the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), and released in early 2004, it was originally positioned as a competitor to Apple&#x27;s iPod. All its hard drive-based players use a graphical user interface (GUI) modeled after Media Center, a software portal bundled with Windows XP Media Center Edition. Manufacturers of PMC devices included Creative, Philips, iriver, Samsung, and Toshiba.

==History==
The platform was conceived in line with Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Media Center strategy, where the idea was to have a single media management interface that would be used on both PCs and in consumer devices, including televisions and handhelds. The strategy was developed by Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Embedded group in partnership with the eHome Division, which formed in February 2001 and started partnerships with companies like Samsung with the goal to &quot;develop new technologies so consumers can enjoy whole-home entertainment, communications and control experiences where, when and however they want them&quot; and &quot;develop an entire ecosystem of PCs, digital devices, intelligent home appliances and services that will easily and cost-effectively transform average households into next-generation digital homes.&quot; The Windows Media Center name was created with the release of a Windows XP product edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, geared towards this ecosystem.

Codenamed &quot;Media2Go&quot;, it was later rebranded as &quot;Windows Mobile software for Portable Media Centers&quot;, before being named &quot;Portable Media Center&quot;. 

The Portable Media Center was succeeded by Zune, and served as the basis for its software. Zune had similar aims to provide a unifying media platform across PCs, devices, and televisions (3-screen strategy).

==Software==
Its operating system was a specialized version of Windows CE. In 2007, Microsoft discontinued licensing the platform.

All PMCs are able to play audio files in MP3 and display images in JPEG. Also, they support Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary formats: Windows Media Audio (WMA) and Windows Media Video (WMV). Other video formats will either be supported by each individual PMC, or transcoded though Windows Media Player. Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is used for transferring data.

<doc id="951302" wikidata="Q1332396" url="?curid=951302" title="Ellis Arnall">
<text>Ellis Gibbs Arnall (March 20, 1907 – December 13, 1992) was an American politician who served as the 69th Governor of Georgia from 1943 to 1947. A liberal Democrat, he helped lead efforts to abolish the poll tax and to reduce Georgia&#x27;s voting age to 18. Following his departure from office, he became a highly successful attorney and businessman.

==Family==
Arnall learned that his first immigrant ancestor was a colonist from England who came to what was then the Colony of Virginia in 1621. A man named Edward Waters was given 100 acres of land in Elizabeth City, Virginia because he paid for the transportation of two servants to come to the colony. One of these servants was William Arnall, who arrived on a ship called the Seaflower in 1621. Edward Waters covered the cost of William Arnall’s trip, which was owed to a man named Thomas Hamor. The land was granted to Edward Waters on August 14, 1624.

==Education==
Born in Newnan, Georgia, Ellis Arnall attended Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, then graduated from the University of the South, and then from the University of Georgia School of Law. He was admitted to the practice of law in 1931. While attending Mercer University, Arnall was initiated into Kappa Alpha Order.

==Early career==
In 1932, Coweta County voters elected Arnall to the Georgia House of Representatives. Arnall was elected Speaker Pro Tempore, the second highest officer position in the Georgia House. Governor Eurith D. Rivers appointed Arnall, then 31, to a vacancy in the office of state attorney general.

In 1935, he married Mildred Slemons, whom he met at a friend&#x27;s wedding. The two were married until her death in 1980. Although Mildred Arnall was not particularly fond of politics and stayed out of the political arena, she stood by her husband throughout his career and encouraged him to succeed at whatever he did.

==Governor==

Actions undertaken by Governor Eugene Talmadge had caused the state&#x27;s colleges to lose accreditation. Arnall unseated Talmadge in the 1942 primary, 174,757 (57.7 percent) to 128,394 (42.4 percent). Without Republican opposition, Arnall became the youngest governor then serving in the United States.

Arnall obtained the repeal of the poll tax, ratification in 1945 of a new state constitution, and a state employee merit system. He also retired the Georgia state debt. When young men were drafted into the armed forces during World War II, Arnall argued that youths old enough to fight in war should be able to vote for their country&#x27;s leadership. He succeeded in lowering the voting age to eighteen more than two decades before the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution implemented that change nationally. Georgia thus became the first state to grant the franchise to 18-year-olds. Arnall also removed the prison system from under the governor&#x27;s direct control, establishing a board of corrections to oversee state prisons and a pardon and parole board to handle such requests. He removed the University of Georgia from political machinations, and he led efforts to prevent a governor from exercising dictatorial powers, as opponents of Eugene Talmadge stated had allegedly occurred during his administration. Arnall&#x27;s reforms won him attention from the national press. Additionally, Arnall, who had become a proponent of civil rights, argued that African Americans should be able to vote in the state&#x27;s primary election.

==Re-election attempt==

In 1941 a constitutional amendment had lengthened the governor&#x27;s term in Georgia from two years to four, but governors serving a four-year term were unable to seek re-election immediately; they had to wait at least four years to serve again. Arnall&#x27;s career declined as he was unable to persuade the legislature to take steps to allow him to seek re-election. Arnall stood behind Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s efforts to remain Vice President in 1944, when the former United States Secretary of Agriculture was replaced by U.S. Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri. Arnall adhered to the United States Supreme Court decision banning the all-white Democratic party primary in the case &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; and hence opened the crucial Democratic primary elections to African Americans. This move particularly enraged Eugene Talmadge and his supporters, who used the issue to brand Arnall a &#x27;race-traitor&#x27;.

Talmadge was elected governor once again in 1946. (who was supported by Arnall) and another former governor, Eurith D. Rivers. However, he died in December, a month before he was scheduled to take office. The state legislature then elected Talmadge&#x27;s son, Herman Talmadge, as governor. Arnall refused to resign the office during the controversy, and the younger Talmadge ended up locking Arnall out of his office in the state capitol. Arnall soon endorsed Lieutenant Governor-elect Melvin E. Thompson&#x27;s initially unsuccessful claim to the governorship; after Herman Talmadge was removed from the office, Thompson became governor.

==Later career==
After leaving office, Arnall worked as an attorney and a businessman in Atlanta, founding Arnall Golden &amp; Gregory (now Arnall Golden Gregory LLP), which continues to be one of Atlanta&#x27;s leading law firms. One of his law partners was later U.S. Representative Elliott Levitas. Arnall served in the Truman administration for a short time as Director of the Office of Price Stabilization. Truman offered Arnall the post of Solicitor General but he declined in order to return to private practice. His business career made him a multimillionaire, and he was able to live comfortably for most of his life.

==1966 election==
Arnall&#x27;s last campaign was for governor in 1966. His primary opponents for the nomination were Lester Maddox, an Atlanta restaurant owner who had hoisted ax handles as a symbol of his opposition to desegregation, and Jimmy Carter. Maddox called Arnall &quot;the granddaddy of forced racial integration ... a candidate who would never raise his voice or a finger - much less an ax handle - to protect the liberty of Georgia.&quot; Arnall practically ignored Maddox and concentrated his fire on Republican Howard Callaway, on whom Arnall had compiled a dossier that he said would guarantee Republican defeat in the general election. Arnall won a plurality of the vote in the primary but was denied the required majority, because of support for Carter, then a state senator from Plains. Arnall barely campaigned in the runoff, and the result was a surprising victory for Maddox. Carter had refused to endorse Arnall, but he formally supported Maddox in the general election against Callaway.

Maddox defeated Arnall in the runoff, 443,055 to 373,004. The civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., denounced what he called &quot;a corroding cancer in the Georgia body politic. Georgia is a sick state produced by the diseases of a sick nation. This election revealed that Georgia is desperately competing with Mississippi for the bottom.&quot; Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr., of Atlanta, who once worked for Arnall&#x27;s law firm, blamed Arnall&#x27;s loss on the &quot;combined forces of ignorance, prejudice, reactionism, and the duplicity of many Republican voters,&quot; many of whom are believed to have voted for Maddox in the Democratic runoff on the theory that Maddox would be a weaker opponent for Callaway than Arnall would have been.

Stunned Arnall backers announced a write-in candidacy for the general election, a move that impacted Callaway more than it did Maddox. In the general election, Callaway finished in the tabulation with a slight plurality over Maddox. Arnall received more than 69,000 write-in ballots, far exceeding the margin between Callaway and Maddox. Arnall actually carried one county, Liberty County in the southeastern portion of the state. Under the election rules then in effect, the state legislature was required to select a governor from the two candidates with the highest number of votes. Despite court challenges, the Democratic-dominated legislature overwhelmingly voted for Maddox, who became governor in 1967.

After the 1966 campaign, Arnall never again sought public office.

Arnall was an active Civitan.

He wrote the 1946 book, &quot;The Shore Dimly Seen&quot; (J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.), about politics and challenges of the South.

==Death and legacy==

Harold Paulk Henderson published the 1991 biography, &quot;The Politics of Change in Georgia: A Political Biography of Ellis Arnall&quot;.

He died in 1992 on his large estate. He was worth tens of millions of dollars at the time of his death. In 1997, Arnall was honored with a statue on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol.

Arnall is interred at the Oak Hill Cemetery in his native Newnan.

Arnall Middle School in Newnan is named after him.

<text>Michael Christian Colley, USN (Ret.), (February 19, 1938 – January 19, 2013) was a United States Navy officer who served as vice admiral and whose career included several high-ranking commands in the submarine force and elsewhere in national security positions.

==Early life==
Colley was born in Wheaton, Minnesota, on February 19, 1938.

==Military career==
Colley graduated with distinction from the United States Naval Academy in June 1960. He had sea duty assignments on several nuclear-powered submarines and was Commanding Officer of the attack submarine . He was Commander of the Navy Recruiting Command for three years, and Deputy Commander of the submarine directorate in the Pentagon. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in Computer Systems from the Naval Postgraduate School. Other operational assignments included command of the submarine tender in Guam and the Navy&#x27;s largest submarine squadron in Groton, Connecticut. During the first Gulf War, he was commander of the Pacific Fleet submarine force of over 40 boats from his headquarters at Pearl Harbor. Earlier, he was Director, Division of Mathematics and Science (including the departments of math, physics, chemistry, oceanography and computer science) at the Naval Academy.

==Activism and views==
After leaving the navy, Colley was active in the national security policy and analysis field, intelligence evaluation and senior management level positions in the public sector. He joined the Libertarian Party in 2003 and served as an elected member of the Libertarian National Committee from 2004 to 2010. Colley always advocated that the purpose of the United States military was defense and &quot;not to serve as the world policeman,&quot; or &quot;build democracy or engage in nation-building.&quot; Colley was interested in civil liberties issues and opposed government regulation &quot;of all facets of our lives.&quot; On immigration, he welcomed people coming to the United States to &quot;enjoy the freedoms we have&quot; and opposed building a fence on the U.S.-Mexico border.

<doc id="951316" wikidata="Q22111959" url="?curid=951316" title="Nilgiri tahr">
<text>The Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius) is an ungulate that is endemic to the Nilgiri Hills and the southern portion of the Western and Eastern Ghats in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in southern India. It is the only species in the genus Nilgiritragus and is closely related to the sheep of the genus &quot;Ovis&quot;.

It is the state animal of Tamil Nadu.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Nilgiritragus&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit words Nila(blue) and Giri(mountains) meaning &quot;blue hills&quot; and the Greek word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;goat&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The Nilgiri tahr was described as &quot;Capra warryato&quot; by Gray.

==Taxonomy==
The species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Hemitragus&quot; together with the Himalayan tahr (&quot;H. jemlahicus&quot;) and the Arabian tahr (&quot;Arabitragus jayakari&quot;). A 2005 phylogenetic analysis showed that the Himalayan and Arabian tahr are sisters of the genus &quot;Capra&quot; while the Nilgiri tahr is a sister of the genus &quot;Ovis&quot; and it was therefore separated into the monotypic genus &quot;Nilgiritragus&quot; in 2005. The divergence from the common ancestor of &quot;Ovis&quot; and &quot;Nilgiritragus&quot; is estimated to about 2.7-5.2 million years ago. Estimates point to the genetic separation of the populations north (Nilgiris) and south (Anamalais) of the Palghat Gap about 1.5 million years ago.

==Description==

The Nilgiri tahr is a stocky goat with short, coarse fur and a bristly mane. Males are larger than females and of darker colour when mature. Both sexes have curved horns, reaching up to for males and for females. Adult males weigh and stand about tall at the shoulder. Adult males develop a light grey area on their backs, thus are called &quot;saddlebacks&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Nilgiri tahr can be found only in India. It inhabits the open montane grassland habitat of the South Western Ghats montane rain forests ecoregion. At elevations from , the forests open into large grasslands interspersed with pockets of stunted forests, locally known as &quot;sholas&quot;. These grassland habitats are surrounded by dense forests at the lower elevations. The Nilgiri tahrs formerly ranged over these grasslands in large herds, but hunting and poaching in the 19th century reduced their population.

== Threats ==
The Nilgiri tahr is primarily threatened by habitat loss and disturbance caused by invasive species, and in some sites by livestock grazing, poaching and fragmentation of the landscape.

==Conservation==
As few as 100 Nilgiri tahrs were left in the wild by the end of 20th century. Since that time, their numbers have increased somewhat; in a comprehensive study of the Nilgiri tahr population in Western Ghats, the WWF-India has put the population at 3,122. Their range extends over from north to south, and Eravikulam National Park is home to the largest population. Per the wildlife census conducted by Kerala forest department in association with volunteers from College of Forestry and Veterinary Science under Kerala Agricultural University, from April 24–28, 2014, the number of animals in Eravikulam National Park has increased to 894 individuals. This is the highest ever count recorded in the national park, with the first census in 1996 finding only 640 tahrs. The other significant concentration is in the Nilgiri Hills, with smaller populations in the Anamalai Hills, Periyar National Park, Palani Hills, and other pockets in the Western Ghats south of Eravikulam, almost to India&#x27;s southern tip. A small population of tahrs numbering around 200 is known to inhabit the Boothapandi, Azhakiyapandipuram, Velimalai, Kulasekaram, and Kaliyal Ranges in the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu and another small herd of less than 30 animals is known to inhabit Ponmudi Hills in Trivandrum district of Kerala.

<doc id="951325" wikidata="Q7053882" url="?curid=951325" title="North American Students of Cooperation">
<text>The North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO) is a federation of housing cooperatives in Canada and the United States, started in 1968. Traditionally, NASCO has been associated with student housing cooperatives, though non-student cooperatives are included in its network. NASCO provides its member cooperatives with operational assistance, encourages the development of new cooperatives, and serves as an advocate for cooperatives to government, universities, and communities. NASCO teaches leadership skills, provides information, and serves as a central link in facilitating the fruition of the cooperative vision for students and youth.

== Programs and services==

===Linking and networking activities===
NASCO acts as the organized voice of the &quot;group-equity&quot; cooperative housing movement, both in terms of bringing together student and community co-op activists, and in maintaining relationships with national cooperative organizations, including the National Cooperative Business Association and the Cooperative Housing Federation of Canada.

===Training and consulting===
NASCO works with its members and the general public on a variety of more extensive training and consulting activities. The NASCO staff visits Active Member groups at least once every two years, providing free consultation and training on a variety of topics as a member service.

NASCO holds numerous workshops with topics including meeting process, board roles and responsibilities, planning, staff relations, marketing, diversity awareness, conflict resolution, facilitation, consensus decision-making, and organizational development for new cooperatives. Recent consulting efforts have included general manager evaluation assistance, business plan development, and expansion assistance. Other on-site consulting has included work on governance systems, accounting systems, maintenance planning, member recruitment, and participation strategies.

===&quot;Co-op Voices&quot;===
NASCO&#x27;s &quot;Co-op Voices&quot; newsletter features reports on activity among cooperatives in Canada and the United States. It reports on NASCO&#x27;s activities and provides updates on co-operative news. The newsletter articles are written by and for co-op members.

===Regional activity===
NASCO supports and assists, to varying degrees, regional networking and training opportunities for co-op members and staff. In the Midwest, on the West Coast, in Ontario, in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and in the Northeast, co-ops meet annually for workshops and social events, where they can discuss issues pertinent to their co-ops.

===The NASCO Cooperative Education and Training Institute===
NASCO holds an annual conference, NASCO Institute, which is usually held in Ann Arbor, Michigan and hosted by the Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan. This is a multiday conference, most of which is spent in workshops, skillshares, and caucuses. The courses cover topics of interest to participants in the cooperative movement and progressivism in general. There is typically a guest speaker and an annual theme.

===Action Camp===
The Action Camp, held each August, provides an intensive training environment for leaders and active members of housing co-ops, worker collectives, and other democratically run communities. Participants spend one week in a beautiful, natural environment engaging in a week-long program on privilege and anti-oppression work and interactive fun, using techniques from Augusto Boal&#x27;s &quot;Theater of the Oppressed.&quot;

===Development services===
Special organizing and training resources are made available to groups interested in starting or expanding cooperatives. NASCO Development Services provides an array of development services including assistance in pre-development activities, financial assistance, and start-up assistance.

===Kagawa Fund===
In 1989, a $50,000 donation from the Japanese Consumer Cooperative Union was used to seed The Kagawa Fund for Student Cooperative Development. The Kagawa Fund, named for Toyohiko Kagawa, provides loans and technical assistance to new and existing housing cooperatives. The fund is administered by the Cooperative Development Foundation and NASCO Development Services.

===Property ownership and asset management services===
In 1988, NASCO Properties was established as an affiliate of NASCO to purchase and hold title to housing around the United States, which is then leased to local co-ops.

Its first property was the House of Commons, a 21 bedroom student house in Austin, Texas.
It acquired the title from an ailing student housing co-op, ICC-Austin, with the purpose of keeping the building in the affordable cooperative housing sector.
ICC-Austin bought the house back from NASCO Properties in 2003.

NASCO manages NASCO Properties and through it provides assistance to the local leasing co-ops. Staff members visit each leasing co-op at least three times per year to help with finances, maintenance, and other problems or issues that may arise. In 2004, a second title holding organization was created between NASCO and Riverton Community Housing called Lots in Common (LINC). NASCO entered into asset management contracts for Davis Campus Cooperatives in 2006.

NASCO-Partnered Housing Cooperatives include:
* CHEA, Austin, Texas
* Community of Urbana Champaign Cooperative Housing (COUCH), Champaign-Urbana, IL
* Kalamazoo Collective Housing, Kalamazoo, Michigan
* Nickel City Housing Cooperative (NCHC), Buffalo, New York
* Qumbya, Chicago, IL
* Santa Cruz Student Housing Co-ops (SC-SHC), Santa Cruz, California
* Student Cooperative Organization (SCO), Athens, Ohio

<doc id="951340" wikidata="Q4665955" url="?curid=951340" title="Abdullah Almalki">
<text>Abdullah Almalki (born 1971) is a Canadian engineer who was imprisoned and tortured for two years in a Syrian jail after Canadian officials falsely indicated to the Syrian authorities and other countries that he was a terrorist threat.

Almalki has since returned to Canada, where he lives with his wife.

In March 2017, the Canadian government issued an official apology to Almalki and his family.

On October 21, 2008 the Commission of Inquiry Into The Action Of Canadian Officials In Relation To Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad Abou-Elmaati And Muayyed Nureddin, released its report which cleared Almalki of any wrong doing and found that the Canadian government was complicit in his torture in Syria. Following this report and its findings, in 2009 the Canadian Parliament passed a motion calling on the Canadian government to issue an apology to Almalki, compensate him, and correct the misinformation that it shared about him and his family nationally and internationally.

==Life==
Almalki was born in Syria and emigrated to Canada with his parents and three brothers in 1987 at the age of 16. He graduated from Ottawa&#x27;s Lisgar Collegiate Institute two years later, and the following year received his Canadian citizenship.

He attended Carleton University and obtained his degree in electrical engineering, and was consistently scoring at the top of his class.

==Work in Afghanistan==
In 1992, Almalki sponsored an Afghan orphan through a Canadian NGO, and decided to travel to the country for three months. The following year, he returned for two months to volunteer with Human Concern International, in projects funded by the United Nations Development Programme.

Upon returning to Canada, Almalki married Kuzaima in October 1993, who was pursuing her Ph.D. in Economics. The couple returned to Pakistan to work with HCI. However, the organisation had brought back Ahmed Khadr as their regional director, after he recuperated from an earlier injury, and Almalki found his leadership and workaholic tendencies to be overbearing, and left the organisation in April 1994, earlier than intended.

==Return to Canada==

In 1997, Maher Arar listed Almalki as his &quot;emergency contact&quot; with his landlord.

In 1998, when Almalki returned to Canada to open an electronics export business &quot;Dawn Services&quot; with his wife, he was questioned twice by Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent Theresa Sullivan, who asked him to &quot;speculate&quot; about the possible relations of the HCI regional director (Khadr) with Islamic militants, and whether Almalki had ever sold nuclear material to Pakistan, or walkie-talkies to the Taliban - all of which Almalki said seemed like ridiculous claims.

In 1999, he expanded his business and rented office space in a business park, also he expanded his business into the cellphone market .

In 2000, and again following the September 11, 2001 attacks, CSIS agent Violaine Pepin spoke to him to ask about a Muslim associate with a pilot&#x27;s license with whom Almalki had flown to Hong Kong in 1999 to sell radios in the final weeks of Y2K.

After Maher Arar had moved back to Ottawa, he had a meeting with Almalki on October 12, 2001. They met at the Mango Café, a popular shawarma restaurant in a strip mall and talked about doctors and bought a print cartridge together. The following month, Almalki flew to Malaysia to visit his mother-in-law.

In January 2002, Almalki was one of seven targets of simultaneous search warrants by Project O Canada. It was found later through court document that these search warrants were obtained by provided a judge false information obtained under torture, and without telling the judge where the information came from.

==Arrest in Syria==
On May 3, 2002, Almalki arrived in Syria for the first time since he was a child, to visit his ill grandmother. Upon his arrival he was arrested on suspicion of terrorist connections. His arrest was based on information sent to the Syrians by the Canadian government.

During the time Almalki was in a Syrian jail, he was not asked anything related to Syrian interests. Most questions were about his life in Canada. In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation shortly after Arar&#x27;s release from Syria, Arar described encountering Almalki in prison, weak, emaciated and suffering from the effects of torture.

Almalki was released on $125 bail in March 2004 and the Syrian State Supreme Security Court acquitted him of all charges in July 2004. Almalki returned to Canada after the acquittal.

Almalki&#x27;s case was taken up by many organizations in Canada, including Amnesty International. The Canadian government convened an inquiry into the role Canadian authorities may have had in his case, headed by Frank Lacobucci. The inquiry, concluded in 2008, also included the role of Canadian officials into the cases of Ahmad Abou-Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin. The Canadian government inquiry into the Arar affair indicated that the Canadian government had sent questions to Syrian military intelligence for use in his interrogation.

According to historian Andy Worthington, author of &quot;The Guantanamo Files&quot;, Almalki described three of his fellow captives in Syria&#x27;s Palestinian Branch military prison: Omar Ghramesh, Abu Abdul Halim Dalak and a Syrian teenager who was captured during the same raid where Abu Zubaydah was captured, who Worthington concluded was Noor al-Deen.

On June 18, 2009, the Canadian House of Commons Public Safety Committee voted to urge the Prime Minister to issue an official apology to and to provide compensation to Almalki, el-Maati and Nureddin.

It was reported in July 2017 that three Muslim Canadian men, detained and tortured in the Middle East during the security clampdown that followed 9/11, will get $31.25 million from the federal government. It is not known publicly if Almalki was one of the three.

<text>Abamectin (also called avermectin B1) is a widely used insecticide and anthelmintic. Abamectin, is a member of the avermectin family and is a natural fermentation product of soil dwelling actinomycete &quot;Streptomyces avermitilis&quot;. Abamectin differs from ivermectin, the popular member of the avermectin family, by a double bond between carbons 22 and 23. Fermentation of &quot;Streptomyces avermitilis&quot; yields eight closely related avermectin homologs, with the B1a and B1b forms comprising the majority of the fermentation. The non-proprietary name, abamectin, refers to a mixture of B1a (~80%) and B1b (~20%). Out of all the avermectins, abamectin is the only one that is used both in agriculture and pharmaceuticals.

== Mode of Action ==
Avermectins bind to the glutamate-gated chloride channels that are found in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. They cause hyperpolarization of these cells resulting in paralysis and death. Mammals only possess glutamate-gated chloride channels in the brain and spinal cord and as the avermectins have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated channels and do not usually cross the blood–brain barrier, they are very safe for mammals.

==History==
Avermectins were discovered in 1967 in fermentation broths of an actinomycete culture received from the Kitasato Institute in Japan, following an intensive search designed to find natural products with anthelmintic activity. It was not until 1985 ivermectin was first used to treat infections with &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot; (onchocerciasis or river blindness) in humans by the United Nations. The discoverers of avermectin, William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura, shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

==Activity==
Abamectin is an insecticide as well as an acaricide (miticide) and a nematicide. It is also used to control fire ants. Abamectin is provided orally to horses for deworming them.

==Use==
Abamectin is also used as a veterinary antihelmintic. Resistance to abamectin-based antihelmintics, although a growing problem, is not as common as to other classes of veterinary antihelmintics. The benzoate salt emamectin benzoate is also used as an insecticide. Avermectins have been used to treat various ailments caused by parasites in both humans and animals. Avermectins including abamectin were studied for use as anti alcohol therapies. Recently, ivermectin is being studied for use as an anti inflammatory agent.

== Environmental Fate ==
Abamectin degrades rapidly when exposed to light (photodegradation) on plant surfaces, in soil, dung and water. Half life of Avermectins (including abamectin) varies between 0.5 and 23 days depending on the rate and substrate (water, soil, faeces or plant). Avermectin B1a applied at 0.02-0.03 lb ai/acre (50% higher than recommended rates) resulted in very low residue.

== Non targets ==
Abamectin is highly toxic to bees either if they consume or come in direct contact. However, plant parts exposed to abamectin spraying did not cause toxicity to bees 24 hours after treatment. The reason for lower toxicity in foliage is due to a half life &lt;24 hours in plant surfaces.

== Trade names ==
Trade names include Abba, Abathor, Affirm, Agri-Mek, Avid, Dynamec, Epi-Mek, Genesis Horse Wormer, Reaper, Termictine 5%, Vertimec,
CAM-MEK 1.8% EC (cam for agrochemicals), Zephyr and Cure 1.8 EC.

<text>Prigogine&#x27;s nightjar (Caprimulgus prigoginei) or the Itombwe nightjar, is a bird species of tropical central Africa. It is known from only one specimen taken at Malenge in the Itombwe Mountains in Zaire in August 1955.

It appears to be a forest species, but nothing is known of its habits or breeding, although it is likely to nest on bare ground like its relatives. It is assumed to be a nocturnal insectivore like other nightjars.

Prigogine&#x27;s nightjar is a small nightjar at 19 cm, short-tailed and large-headed. The adult female is dark brown with heavy speckling. In flight it is again mainly brown, without the white wing marking found in many of its relatives. There are pale brown wing spots, and whitish tail feather tips. The male is unknown.

The male&#x27;s song is unknown, but unidentified nightjar calls heard in the breeding area include a rapid churring and a knocking sound.

The common name and binomial commemorates the ornithologist Alexandre Prigogine.

<text>Forsyth Street runs from Houston Street south to Henry Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The street was named in 1817 for Lt. Colonel Benjamin Forsyth.

Forsyth Street&#x27;s southernmost portion, south of Canal Street, runs parallel to the Manhattan Bridge in Chinatown. On the west side of this block, a greenmarket operates in the shadow of the bridge.

Forsyth Street is interrupted north of Canal Street for one block due to a 20th-century schoolhouse, now housing Pace University High School and I.S. 131, built on the former route. From there it runs parallel to Chrystie Street that lies to its west, with Sara D. Roosevelt Park separating the two. Since October 2008 the parallel parking lane on the west side of the street is separated from the curb by a bicycle lane carrying traffic north from the Manhattan Bridge. The street traverses the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.

From south to north, Forsyth Street starts at Henry Street, intersects East Broadway, Division Street, and Canal Street, becomes a pedestrian street for one block, then continues from Hester Street, intersects Grand Street, Broome Street, Delancey Street, Rivington Street and Stanton Street, and ends at Houston Street.

<text>Carbendazim is a fungicide, a member benzimidazole fungicides. It is a metabolite of benomyl.

The fungicide is used to control plant diseases in cereals and fruits, including citrus, bananas, strawberries, macadamia nuts, pineapples, and pomes. A 4.7% solution of carbendazim hydrochloride, sold as Eertavas, is marketed as a treatment for Dutch elm disease.

==Other uses==
It is also employed as a casting worm control agent in amenity turf situations such as golf greens, tennis courts etc. and in some countries is licensed for that use only.

==Safety, regulation, controversy==
High doses of carbendazim destroy the testicles of laboratory animals.

Maximum pesticide residue limits (MRLs) for fresh produce in the EU are between 0.1 and 0.7 mg/kg with the exception of loquat fruits, which is set at 2 mg/kg. The limits for more commonly consumed citrus and pome fruits are between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg.

Use of this fungicide on macadamia plantations has proven controversial in Queensland.

<text>A nematicide is a type of chemical pesticide used to kill plant-parasitic nematodes. Nematicides have tended to be broad-spectrum toxicants possessing high volatility or other properties promoting migration through the soil. Aldicarb (Temik), a carbamate insecticide marketed by Bayer CropScience, is an example of a commonly used commercial nematicide. It is important in potato production, where it has been used for control of soil-borne nematodes. Aldicarb is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse. In case of severe poisoning, the victim dies of respiratory failure. It is no longer authorised for use in the EU and, in August 2010, Bayer CropScience announced that it planned to discontinue aldicarb by 2014. Human health safety and environmental concerns have resulted in the widespread deregistration of several other agronomically important nematicides. Prior to 1985, the persistent halocarbon DBCP was a widely used nematicide and soil fumigant. However, it was banned from use after being linked to sterility among male workers; the Dow Chemical company was subsequently found liable for more than $600 million in damages.

Several natural nematicides are known. An environmentally benign garlic-derived polysulfide product is approved for use in the European Union (under Annex 1 of 91/414) and the UK as a nematicide. Another common natural nematicide is obtained from neem cake, the residue obtained after cold-pressing the fruit and kernels of the neem tree. Known by several names in the world, the tree was first cultivated in India in ancient times and is now widely distributed throughout the world. The root exudate of marigold (&quot;Tagetes&quot;) is also found to have nematicidal action. Nematophagous fungi, a type of carnivorous fungi, can be useful in controlling nematodes, &quot;Paecilomyces&quot; being one example.

Besides chemicals, soil steaming can be used in order to kill nematodes. Superheated steam is induced into the soil, which causes almost all organic material to deteriorate.

<text>Ahmed Saïd Khadr (; March 1, 1948 – October 2, 2003) was an Egyptian-Canadian with alleged ties to al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. His activity in Afghanistan began in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, and he has been described as having had ties to a number of militants within the Afghan mujahideen, including Saudi militant Osama bin Laden. Khadr was accused by Canada and the United States of being a &quot;senior associate&quot; and financier of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

During this period, Khadr worked with a number of charitable non-governmental organizations that served Afghan refugees and set up agricultural projects. He set up two orphanages for children whose parents had been killed over the course of the decade-long Soviet–Afghan War. He funded the construction of Makkah Mukarama Hospital in Afghanistan with his own savings, as well as seven medical clinics in the Afghan refugee camps of Pakistan.

Due to his prominent regional role, Khadr helped negotiate compromises among rival Afghan warlords, power brokers, and leaders in order to establish peace in the region. The Canadian government had considered him to be the locally highest-ranking member of al-Qaeda. In 1999, the United Kingdom added Khadr&#x27;s name to a list of al-Qaeda members compiled with the United Nations.

Shortly after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, two of Khadr&#x27;s sons were captured separately by American troops in 2002. They were later detained at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. Aged 15 at the time of his capture, Omar Khadr was among the youngest detainees at the camp, and the last citizen of a Western country (Canada) to be held there. Omar accepted a plea deal (which he later recanted) and pleaded guilty to charges of war crimes in October 2010; he was repatriated to Canada in 2012 to serve the remainder of his sentence and was released on bail in 2015.

On October 2, 2003, Khadr was killed by Pakistani security forces during a gunfight with al-Qaeda and Taliban militants near the Afghanistan–Pakistan border. Following his death, his family members moved back to Canada, where they remain today.

==Early life==
He was born in Egypt in 1948 to Mohamed Zaki Khadr and Munira Osman. Raised in Shubra El-Kheima, Khadr was a shy child with a speech impediment. He frequently stayed at the house of his much older half-brother Ahmed Fouad. When Fouad left for the United States in the early 1970s, Khadr asked his father if he could follow – but was forbidden. Planning the move behind his father&#x27;s back, Khadr moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1975 at the age of 27.

After a few months in Montreal, Khadr moved to Toronto. He was accepted at the University of Ottawa to study Computer Programming. In Ottawa he met Qasem Mahmud, the founder of &quot;Camp Al-Mu-Mee-Neen&quot; in Creemore, Ontario. Khadr volunteered to help at the camp. There he met Maha el-Samnah, a Palestinian immigrant and volunteer. She was impressed by his calmness and thought he was a good listener. Mahmud later described their meeting as &quot;love at first sight&quot;.

==Marriage and family==
Ahmed and Maha married in November at Jami Mosque in Toronto. In May 1978, the couple moved to Ottawa so Ahmed could finish his studies. In 1979, Maha gave birth to their first child and daughter, Zaynab.

Khadr joined the Muslim Students Association at the university. He came to agree with their notions of Sharia law, and advocated Islamic rule for his native Egypt.

Khadr started working at Bell Northern Research, while writing his master&#x27;s thesis, entitled &quot;Development of a CSSL interface to GASP IV&quot;. Maha gave birth to their son Abdullah in 1981.

==Career==
The following year, Khadr was offered a position at the Gulf Polytechnique University in Bahrain, where he hoped to become a professor. According to a biography published by al-Qaeda in 2008, he did not like living in Canada, so he accepted the position.

In 1982, Maha gave birth to Abdurahman, their third son. Disappointed to find Western influences in Bahrain, Khadr became interested in the struggle of Afghans as a result of the Soviet invasion. He wanted to help the Muslim widows and orphans in Afghanistan.

Through 1983 and 1984, the family lived in Bahrain while the children were in school. During the summer holidays, Khadr traveled to Pakistan. His wife took the three children to Scarborough, Canada, where they lived with her parents. Khadr told friends that he had no intentions of helping to fight the Soviets, only of helping the victims of the invasion.

==Charitable work begins==

During his 1984 summer in Pakistan, Khadr joined Lajnat al Dawa, a Kuwaiti-run relief organization to help Afghan refugees living in Pakistan after the Soviet invasion. He returned to Toronto in December with his family, to explain his decision to Maha&#x27;s parents. After returning briefly to Bahrain, the family stopped in Kuwait to meet the charity&#x27;s organizers. By January, they had settled in a second-floor apartment above the Kuwait Red Crescent Society&#x27;s offices in Peshawar, Pakistan.

While in Pakistan, Khadr became known by the &quot;kunya&quot; Abu Abdurahman al-Kanadi (Father of Abdurahman, the Canadian), due to the community mistaking which of his sons was eldest. Refusing to abandon his Western clothing, Khadr frequently took care of the children while Maha volunteered at the Red Crescent hospital. During his time in Pakistan, Khadr met with the journalist Eric Margolis several times. He later said that Khadr was a &quot;man of respect&quot; in the city, and seemed &quot;entirely humanitarian and not ideological at all&quot;.

The family returned to Canada several times a year, visiting relatives. Khadr conducted fundraising for his charitable work, giving speeches at mosques and community events. During one of the visits back to Toronto, on July 6, 1985, Maha gave birth to the couple&#x27;s fourth child, Ibrahim. Diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, the boy was transferred to the city&#x27;s Hospital for Sick Children for surgery.

Three months later, the family returned to Peshawar. That year, Khadr met Abdullah Anas, an Algerian who had helped fight the Soviets in northern Afghanistan. Anas would later describe Khadr as &quot;not a man of fighting, not a man of jihad, just a man of charity work aid&quot;. He also became acquainted with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the founder of the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan and a &quot;mujahideen&quot; warlord, with whom Khadr would later nurture a close relationship.

Returning to Toronto in the summer of 1986, Ibrahim underwent more surgery. On September 19, Maha gave birth to another son, Omar. Six days later, the 39-year-old Khadr was featured in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, calling attention to the plight of Afghanistan. He condemned the Soviets for cluster bomblets and landmines disguised as colorful toys, attracting children who picked them up and sometimes lost limbs.

In the autumn, the family returned to Peshawar, where Khadr met Ayman al-Zawahiri, a doctor who had been convicted in Pakistan five years earlier for arms dealing. The doctor was then working in the Red Crescent hospital treating wounded refugees. The two quickly became friends, and had many conversations about the need for Islamic government and the needs of the Afghan people. At this time, the family was living in a &quot;tiny&quot; apartment on an $800 monthly allowance.

In 1987, Khadr convinced his wife to let her parents take care of their sickly son Ibrahim in Scarborough. He said she could help a hundred Afghan children in Peshawar if she sent him back for care. He often praised the bravery of the fighters in the Battle of Jaji to his children, but never suggested that he had participated.

In January 1988, Maha returned to Toronto with her youngest, Omar, to look after Ibrahim so her parents could visit relatives in the Middle East. Ibrahim became sick during the visit, and was rushed to the hospital. He was pronounced brain dead the following morning. 

That year, Khadr joined Human Concern International full time; it was a Canadian-based charity operating in Peshawar with which he had been cooperating. The charity had been investigated following a statement by Osama bin Laden that &quot;The bin Laden Establishment&#x27;s aid covers 13 countries ... this aid comes in particular from the Human Concern International Society&quot;. Under Khadr&#x27;s leadership, HCI built &quot;Hope Village&quot; in Akora Khattak to house 400 orphans, and a number of unemployed refugees were given work repairing damage at the Khost airfield. He gained the support of the World Food Program, and a $325,000 donation from the Canadian International Development Agency.

Around this time in 1989, Khadr solicited aid from Canadian Doreen Wicks. She agreed to have her own charity send medical supplies to help the Afghan orphans.

Not long after, Anas spoke to Abdullah Azzam about the need to ensure Muslim help reached northern Afghanistan, and not just that of Western NGOs. Azzam appointed Khadr in charge of a new charity to be affiliated with the Muslim World League NGO. Khadr promised to help raise funds for a new Peshawar-based charity, to be named al-Tahaddi (&quot;The Challenge&quot;), if Azzam gave him an endorsement to help him appeal to Canadian mosques.

Citing a disagreement with Khadr, Abu Hassan al Madani and Enaam Arnaout led the Islamic Benevolence Committee to withhold its donation to al-Tahaddi, so Wael Julaydan met with Khadr on 19 October 1988 to discuss the financial shortfall and issues. Khadr and Julaydan signed a contract specifying the exact roles of personnel and funds in the group, but it appears Khadr didn&#x27;t notice the clause that would allow a steering committee headed by Azzam to replace any administrative staff. Within days, Khadr received notice that he was being replaced just before his scheduled trip to Canada.

On November 2, unknown men assumed to be associated with Azzam broke into Khadr&#x27;s Peshawar offices and seized documents, leading to the freezing of al-Tahaddi&#x27;s accounts with Habib Bank and a shifting of the project&#x27;s assets to a Saudi Red Crescent warehouse. When he returned to Peshawar, Khadr accused Azzam of &quot;confiscating&quot; the money he had raised, and spreading rumors that he was a Western spy by having faxed all of al-Tahaddi&#x27;s associates with a list of accusations against Khadr and announcing new leadership.

Khadr demanded a Sharia court be convened to mediate the matter, and sought Sheikh Rabbani, Sheikh Sayyaf, Yunus Khalis or Gulbuddin Hekmatyra to arbitrate. It was ultimately led by Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif and Abu Hajjer al-Iraqi in Osama bin Laden&#x27;s compound on December 26, and Azzam was found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; of spreading allegations against Khadr and ordered to return the money to the charity for which it had been raised, and to return Khadr as director of the charity. No further sentence was imposed, although Azzam refused to comply with the Court Order which aggrieved al-Sharif who later published a book in which he characterizes Azzam as having rejected the sharia by his default, although Ayman al-Zawahiri later wrote a piece in which he criticised al-Sharif for being too quick to judge Azzam&#x27;s intentions and reminding readers that both parties were noble mujahideen. When Azzam was killed in 1989, Khadr was among the mourners at his funeral.

In 1989, Maha gave birth to a fifth son, Abdulkareem. Eight months after the end of the Soviet invasion, Khadr was profiled in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper, pleading for Western aid to help Afghanistan rebuild; he noted the nation had the highest child mortality rate in the world. Around this time, he began to adopt the kurta and pakul associated with the Mujahideen, giving up Western clothing.

In September 1991, Khadr gave a fundraising lecture entitled &quot;Afghanistan: The Untold Story&quot; at the Markham Islamic Centre. He described the suffering of the widows and orphans, but emphasized the valor of the &quot;mujahideen&quot; who had repelled the Soviets. They had been supported by the United States at the time.

In 1992, Khadr sustained severe shrapnel wounds which tore apart his right side, puncturing his bladder and a kidney. The exact cause of the wounds is debated, Human Concern International maintains that Khadr was inside one of their refugee camps when he stepped on a landmine, while his son Abdurahman has said that he was hurt by a bomb during the ongoing battles between warlords.

Unable to get proper medical care in Peshawar, he was taken to Karachi. Maha convinced him to return to Toronto a month later, and he was admitted to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Although there were fears he&#x27;d never walk again, or his arm would require amputation, his surgeon managed to treat Khadr successfully. His half-brother Ahmed Faoud came up from the United States to visit Khadr, who was growing restless with his long recovery time.

According to Mustafa Hamid Khadr had quietly played a role in resisting the Soviet Union.

Abu Abdul Rahman al-Kanadi did excellent work during the jihad against the Soviets but it has not been well recognised, especially the military work he did in Logar province. As you know, Logar is in between Paktia and Kabul. Abu Abdul Rahman al-Kanadi trained at Sadda and was at Jaji with Abu Abdullah; he and Abu Abdul Rahman al-Surahyi did a fantastic job with their observation work and giving guidance for the Arab activity. When the enemy discovered their hiding place, the jets bombed the area very heavily but they were not hurt.

==Return to Pakistan==

In the autumn of 1993, Khadr returned to Pakistan with his family, renting a comfortable house with its own garden in Hayatabad while he continued working with HCI despite his injuries. Without the use of his right hand and walking with a limp, Khadr found his injuries frustrating.

Before leaving for Tajikistan in 1994, a young Ibn Al-Khattab gave Abdulkareem a rabbit, which was named &quot;Khattab&quot;. The rabbit&#x27;s legs were injured during rough play with his youngest daughter Maryam, and the crippled Ahmed would often sit in the backyard, crying over it.

Human Concern International had struggled with the year-long absence of Khadr&#x27;s management, and had hired Abdullah Almalki from Carleton University to replace him. Almalki was on sabbatical leave at the time of Khadr&#x27;s return. The two managers clashed, as Khadr&#x27;s work ethic had changed after his injury. He had become a demanding workaholic who began alienating his colleagues. Almalki left HCI early, citing frustration with Khadr. Khadr&#x27;s eldest son, Abdullah later confided in his father that he was not spending enough time with his family, due to his time and efforts towards the local orphanages.

Maintaining his connections with regional warlords, Khadr was furious at their in-fighting which he felt was invalidating the Mujahideen success in driving out the Soviets. Believing in the need for an Islamic government, he talked to his children about the rewards of martyrdom.

In 1994, he sent his two oldest sons, Abdullah and Abdurahman, to Khalden training camp. He visited the camp once after they started there, to meet with Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi.

In Pakistan, Khadr renovated an abandoned building, which had previously used by the KhAD secret police, to be used for his charity, but once it was refurbished, the government announced they would re-take control of the building. An angry Khadr wrote a letter to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, complaining that he should be compensated for the money he spent in fixing the building. He clashed with the Taliban again when they objected to the fact he had opened a school for girls, who were not allowed to receive an education under Taliban law.

When Mohamad Elzahabi was injured in a 1995 battle in Kabul, Khadr visited him the Peshawar hospital.

==Arrest, investigation and release==

In July 1995, Khadr arranged for his daughter Zaynab to marry an Egyptian man named Khalid Abdullah, &quot;an Egyptian guest of the Taliban&quot; from the Sudan, in December, and Maha began preparing an apartment for the couple in the family&#x27;s house. Abdullah lived with the family for two months, &quot;like a trial engagement&quot;.

On November 19, Ayman al-Zawahiri carried out an attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan, and the suitor Ahmed had arranged for his daughter went into hiding, named as one of the conspirators. A warrant was sworn for Khadr&#x27;s arrest eight days later, after it was discovered that Khalid Abdullah had purchased one of the vehicles used in the attack. Two dozen Pakistani went to his house on November 27 at approximately 23:00, but he was still in Afghanistan and had been there since before the attacks. Maha barricaded the door, while the 15-year-old Zaynab took her father&#x27;s rifle and held it over her head screaming. The police managed to enter, and took his wife, three children and in-laws who were visiting from Canada, into custody while they searched the house, seizing $10,000 $29,000 or $40,000 in cash from the home. While he insisted the money was to pay the salaries of HCI workers, others alleged he had used HCI to launder money eventually used to finance the attack. His wife and children were released shortly after the raid, while his in-laws were held for a month before being released.

Accounts differ as to whether Ahmed was arrested on December 3 at the border crossing back into Pakistan, or if he had returned to his home the previous day and gone to the police station to lodge a complaint about the raid, and been arrested. He was charged with aiding terrorism, and faced the death penalty, although investigators conceded they &quot;did not have much evidence&quot; linking him to the bombing.

After being refused food for two days, Khadr announced he was launching a hunger strike, which led to his collapse on his fifth day and his being transferred to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. He was interviewed in hospital, where he denounced Foreign Minister Assef Ahmad Ali&#x27;s claim that he had financed the explosives, detonation devices, and both vehicles used in the bombing. He stated that his work consisted solely of charitable work to provide food and schooling to Afghan orphans. Foregoing legal advice, he also refused to hire a lawyer to defend him. Suffering from a urinary tract infection due to weight loss, he claimed that he had been targeted simply because of his Egyptian background.

His plight caught the attention of the Canadian Arab Federation and the Jewish Civil Rights Educational Foundation of Canada, the latter of whom wrote to Pakistan urging that Khadr be afforded a fair trial, and expressing their concern &quot;about unfair and unnecessary hardship placed on individuals like Khadr&quot; in Pakistan&#x27;s efforts to combat terrorism. The Canadian-Muslim Civil Liberties Association similarly gathered a petition of 800 signatures and presented it to both Canadian and Pakistani officials, and Human Concern International executive director Kaleem Akhtar echoed his certainty that Khadr was not involved in the blast, stating that &quot;politics was not his cup of tea&quot;, and subsequently started a legal defence fund for Khadr. Rumors began to surface that he had already been extradited to Egypt.

As Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien happened to then be visiting Pakistan, he mentioned the matter to Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who promised &quot;fair trial and fair treatment&quot;. Lacking evidence to suggest Khadr was involved in the bombing, Pakistan dropped their charges and released Khadr in March. Upon returning to Canada, Khadr kissed the ground.

In 2002, Abul-Dahab confessed to Egyptian interrogators that he had funded the bombing of the Egyptian embassy on orders from bin Laden, and had transferred money from a Californian bank account to Pakistan to finance the attack.

==Health &amp; Education Projects International==

Trying to distance themselves from the controversy, HCI issued a statement in December, stating that Khadr and his colleague Helmy el-Sharief no longer worked for the organization. Khadr then founded his own charity, Health &amp; Education Projects International which was located in the Kart-e-Parwan district of Kabul and listed the Canadian Salahedin Mosque as a partner. American prosecutors have alleged the new group, while collecting $70,000 in donations, supported Afghan training camps. In July, Khadr met with bin Laden for the first time, as the latter was beginning construction on a large house.

In 1997, while living in the Pathan district of Peshawar, Khadr began visiting Nazim Jihad, bin Laden&#x27;s family home in Jalalabad. In September, the Khadrs moved into a three-room house owned by Zaffar Rehman, to whom they paid $100 monthly rent. At an unspecified time during his life in Pakistan, Khadr made use of his master&#x27;s degree and provided computer training and systems &quot;for the government employees from 14 departments&quot;.

In May 1998, Essam Marzouk and Mohammed Zeki Mahjoub were also introduced to each other at the home of Khadr&#x27;s in-laws while he was in Toronto. Also that year, Mahmoud Jaballah met Khadr, having invited him to share a cup of tea and discuss their mutual experiences in Peshawar, Pakistan, after Khadr&#x27;s mother-in-law took his wife grocery shopping. At some point, Mohammad Harkat met Khadr in Ottawa and the two of them shared a van back to Toronto. Harkat claims that he met Khadr through his roommate Mohamed El Barseigy, and that Khadr was silent during most of the trip, and his only advice to Harkat was &quot;tell the truth to immigration authorities&quot;. Harkat and Jaballah would both later be jailed on security certificates which cited their contact with Khadr as a factor in their detention.

In June 1998, the family moved into Nazim Jihad while Ahmed was away; but were only there a short time before bin Laden moved and didn&#x27;t invite the family to accompany him. He caved to the demands of his &quot;problem child&quot;, Abdurahman, and purchased him a horse of his own.

That year, Pakistan renewed its claims that Khadr was involved in the embassy bombing, accused him of money laundering and smuggling and suggested he may have been connected to the year&#x27;s simultaneous bombings of American embassies.

Reports suggest that when Pakistani forces stormed the apartment of an Algerian named &quot;Abu Elias&quot; in Lahore, Khadr was actually present but was either not recognised by the troops, or allowed to leave.

In 1999, Khadr met with bin Laden again to try to mitigate hostilities between bin Laden, the Taliban and warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whom Ahmed had recently met in Iran. That year, the United Kingdom submit his name to be put on a United Nations list of individuals believed to finance terrorism, but refused to share any evidence with Canadian officials. He was subsequently sanctioned, and UN states were forbidden from commerce with him.

In January 2001, Khadr&#x27;s name was added to a United Nations list of individuals who supported terrorism associated with Bin Laden.

Later that year, Egyptian forces surrounded Khadr&#x27;s house in Peshawar, and requested that Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence forces offer assistance in capturing the man they still believed had knowledge of the embassy bombing in Islamabad. Instead, the ISI contacted the Taliban, who sent a diplomatic car to pick up Khadr and bring him into Afghanistan.

==Sought by the United States==
Immediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States found Khadr&#x27;s name while &quot;seeking anyone they believe might be linked to bin Laden&quot; and issued a statement that he was &quot;wanted in connection with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks&quot;, and on October 10 listed him as a &quot;primary suspect&quot;. Three days later, the United States froze his assets.

The family fled Kabul the day before its fall to the Northern Alliance, and made a temporary home in the Logar orphanage the night of November 10. This was the last time the United States knew the family&#x27;s location. Maha and Ahmed returned however to gather their possessions. While packing, Kabul&#x27;s walkie-talkie communications ring began reporting that the Taliban had been defeated and the city was being overrun. Running out to their car, they saw wounded men filtering into the streets. Tossing out their computer and a chair, the couple made room in their backseat for three men who had been injured in an explosion. They reached the Logar Hospital at 2am, but were told that only two of the men could be treated. Speeding off with the third, they continued to another nearby hospital but arrived to find their passenger had succumbed to his wounds. Returning to their children at the Logar orphanage, they were informed that Abdurahman had decided to take the truck to Kabul in their absence and spend the night with friends.

Shortly afterwards, Bin Laden approached Khadr and asked him to join the Mujahideen Shura Council, organising the retreat of families from the Northern Alliance onslaught, to the relative safety of the Pakistan border. In April 2002 it was believed that he had fled Nangarhar to Paktia, along with Mullah Kabir.
He was noted for maintaining a close relationship with Maulvi Nazir.

Khadr&#x27;s Canadian property was raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as part of Project O Canada in January 2002. There was also reference to a &quot;seized photograph&quot; that showed Khadr standing alongside an anti-aircraft gun along with anti-Soviet mujahideen.

When his second son, Abdurahman was taken prisoner by the Northern Alliance in November, he sent a request to have his son freed since he had helped the Alliance in the past, but was told that unless he could pay a $10,000 ransom then Abdurahman would be turned over to the Americans. Lacking the money, Khadr asked his eldest son Abdullah to not tell his mother about Abdurahman&#x27;s capture, and only insist that he was &quot;missing&quot;, rather than captured.

In July 2003, the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress stated that Khadr&#x27;s last known whereabouts were in Afghanistan in November 2001. Meanwhile, Khadr was asked to organise militants operating near the border of Shagai, Pakistan, and subsequently asked his son Abdullah and Hamza al-Jowfi to help him procure weapons. He clashed with Abdul Hadi al Iraqi, arguing that guerilla tactics would prove more useful than front line battle.

==Death==
On October 2, 2003, Khadr, his son Abdulkareem, al-Jowfi, al-Iraqi, Khalid Habib and Qari Ismail were all staying at a South Waziristan safe house. The following day, after Fajr prayers, Khadr told his son that Pakistani troops had warned a raid was scheduled in the village, and told him to start preparing to leave the village together. However, a Pakistani helicopter team and hundreds of security forces attacked the village before the pair were able to depart, and Abdulkareem lay down in a ditch but was shot in the spine, paralyzing him from the waist down. The 17-year-old Khalid Murjan Salim was arrested at the scene, the son of alleged militant Murjan Salim, and extradited to Egypt shortly thereafter.

Pakistan initially reported that Khadr had escaped hours before the raid. Other reports suggested that rumors of his death may have been staged to escape investigators. At one point it was reported that Ahmed had lived, and only his son had been killed. Early reports said that it was a joint American-Pakistani operation, while later reports denied American involvement.

Reports said that 12 &quot;al-Qaeda and Taliban members&quot; were killed in the raid on the &quot;armed encampment&quot;, including Hasan Mahsum, and that two al-Qaeda members had been captured. Khadr&#x27;s name was not included in any of the lists of deceased published in local media, and the captured Abdulkareem was unable to identify his father among the photos of corpses later presented to him, although the Islamic Observation Centre reported that Khadr was &quot;caught&quot; in the battle and died defending Abdulkareem. Three weeks after the attack, Pakistan was still reporting that he had escaped the raid and that they had been conducting house-to-house searches for him, although they spoke of having killed a &quot;high-ranking&quot; al-Qaeda member in the attack with a bounty on his head.

In late December, Maha had attorney Hashmat Ali Habib file a petition to the Supreme Court of Pakistan asking for details about whether her husband and son were killed or captured in the operation. Meanwhile, it was believed that the Saudi Sheikh Asadullah stepped up to fill the void left by Khadr&#x27;s death

It was finally reported in January, three months after the operation, that his DNA had been matched to a body found just outside the doorway and he was indeed killed in the attack, leading his family to request the return of his body for burial in Canada. &quot;Arab News&quot; reported that he had only been killed in January, following another Pakistani strike in Wana, after successfully escaping the October firefight. In Canadian Federal Court Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson&#x27;s 2005 ruling rejecting Hassan Almrei&#x27;s application for release, she quoted a confidential CSIS agent named only as &quot;P.G.&quot; as having testified about Khadr dying in 2004.

==Civil lawsuit==

Sgt. Layne Morris and Sgt. Speer&#x27;s widow Tabitha, both represented by Donald Winder, launched a joint civil suit against the estate of Khadr – claiming that the father&#x27;s failure to control son Omar resulted in the loss of Speers&#x27; life and Morris&#x27; right eye. Since American law does not allow civil lawsuits against &quot;acts of war&quot;, Speer and Morris relied on the argument that Omar throwing a grenade was an act of terrorism, rather than war. Utah District Judge Paul Cassell ruled on February 17, 2006, awarding C$102.6 million in damages, approximately C$94 million to Speer and C$8 million to Morris. He said this likely marked the first time terrorist acts have resulted in civil liabilities. The &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; suggested that the plaintiffs might collect funds via the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, but since the Federal government is not bound by civil rulings, it has refused to release Khadr&#x27;s frozen assets.

==Legacy==
After his death, the media began referring to a &quot;Khadr effect&quot;. The Prime Minister had intervened to ensure that Khadr got a fair trial, and the press said that he had intervened after Khadr&#x27;s release. The suggestion was that politicians and the public were equally unwilling to lend any support or benefit of the doubt to the remaining family.

On February 7, 2008, the &quot;National Post&quot; reported that a biography of Khadr was published on an &quot;al Qaeda web-site&quot; as part of an on-line book entitled &quot;Book of 120 Martyrs in Afghanistan.&quot; Seven months later, his family launched The Khadr Legacy which emphasized his work as a relief worker. By July 2013, the website was replaced with a Japanese facial care website.

Khadr remains a controversial figure. Canadian attorney Dennis Edney, lawyer for the Khadr family, has challenged the assumption that Khadr was a member of al-Qaeda, saying in 2001 that he was &quot;really interested in obtaining one piece of evidence that would show indeed that Mr. Khadr was actually a terrorist. To me, it&#x27;s just folklore.&quot; Khadr&#x27;s imam in Canada, Ali Hindy, spoke after his death, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think that he was al-Qaeda, but I think he felt that now he became part of Afghanistan.&quot; His friends described him as being &quot;proud of [being a] Canadian citizen&quot;. Some politicians and media have suggested that he disliked the country.

<text>The Beskids or Beskid Mountains (, , , (), ()) are a series of mountain ranges in the Carpathians, stretching from the Czech Republic in the west along the border of Poland with Slovakia up to Ukraine in the east.

The highest mountain in the Beskids is Hoverla, at .

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name has not been conclusively established. A Thracian or Illyrian origin has been suggested; however, as yet, no theory has majority support among linguists. The word appears in numerous mountain names throughout the Carpathians and the adjacent Balkan regions, like in Albanian . According to linguists Çabej and Orel, it is possibly derived from Proto-Albanian (meaning &#x27;the mountain pastures&#x27;). The Slovak name refers to the Polish Bieszczady Mountains, which is not a synonym for the entire Beskids but one single range, belonging to the Eastern Beskids. According to another linguistic theory, it may be related to Middle Low German , , meaning &#x27;watershed&#x27;.

Historically, the term was used for hundreds of years to describe the mountain range separating the old Kingdom of Hungary from the old Kingdom of Poland. In 1269, the Beskids were known by the Latin name &#x27;Beskid Mountains of Poland&#x27;.

== Definition ==
The Beskids are approximately in length and in width. They stand mainly along the southern border of Lesser Poland with northern Slovakia, stretching to the Moravia and Czech Silesia regions of the eastern Czech Republic and to Carpathian Ruthenia in western Ukraine. Parts form the European Watershed, separating the Oder and Vistula basins in the north from the Eastern Slovak Lowland, part of the Great Hungarian Plain drained by the Danube River.

Geologically all of the Beskids stand within the Outer Western Carpathians and the Outer Eastern Carpathians. In the west they begin at the natural pass of the Moravian Gate, which separates them from the Eastern Sudetes, continue east in a band to the north of the Tatra Mountains, and end in Ukraine. The eastern termination of the Beskids is disputed. According to older sources, the Beskids end at the source of the Tisza River, while newer sources state that the Beskids end at the Uzhok Pass at the Polish–Ukrainian border.

== Subdivisions ==

Multiple traditions, languages and nationalities have developed overlapping variants for the divisions and names of the Beskid ranges. According to the divisions of the Carpathians, they are categorized within:

=== Eastern Beskids ===

Eastern Beskids are divided into two parallel ridges: Wooded Beskids and Polonynian Beskids. 
*Wooded Beskids (; )
**Bieszczady Mountains (; ) → c1
**Sanok-Turka Mountains (; ) → c3
**Skole Beskids (; ) → c2
**Gorgany (; ) → c4
**Pokuttia-Bucovina Beskids (; ) → c5
*Polonynian Beskids (; )
**Smooth Polonyna () → c6
**Polonyna Borzhava () → c7
**Polonyna Kuk () → c8
**Red Polonyna ()→ c9
**Svydovets () → c10
**Chornohora () → c11
**Hrynyavy Mountains () → c12

== Infrastructure ==
The Beskids are currently rich in forest and coal. In the past they were rich in iron ore, with important plants in Ostrava and Třinec – Třinec Iron and Steel Works.

There are many tourist attractions, including historic wooden churches (see Wooden Churches of Southern Little Poland, Carpathian Wooden Churches of Slovakia, and Wooden Churches of Ukraine) and the increasingly popular skiing resorts.

A number of environmental groups support a small but growing population of bears, wolves and lynx in the ecosystem of the Beskidy mountains. The Central Beskids include the Polish Babia Góra National Park and the adjacent Slovak Horná Orava Protected Landscape Area.

<text>The Aero 45 was a twin piston-engined civil utility aircraft produced in Czechoslovakia after World War II. Aero Vodochody produced the aircraft in 1947–1951, after which the Let Kunovice rolled out these planes until 1961. In 1958 the Ae-45S became the first Czechoslovak plane to cross the Atlantic Ocean. It was the first product of the nation&#x27;s postwar aviation industry and proved a great success, with many of the 590 produced being exported.

==Design and development==
Development began 1946 and was accomplished by the technical designers Jiři Bouzek, Ondřej Němec and František Vik. The design bears a superficial resemblance, when viewed nose-on, to the much larger German Siebel Si 204 which, among other German aircraft were produced in Czechoslovakia while under German occupation. The prototype (registered OK-BCA) flew for the first time on 21 July 1947 and the second, registered OK-CDA, one year later. Flight testing ran without incidents and the type was released for series production in 1948. The model number of &quot;45&quot; was not a continuation of Aero&#x27;s pre-war numeration scheme, but a reference to the 4/5 seats in the aircraft.

===Description===
The Aero 45 had a sleek, teardrop-shaped fuselage, with a rounded, extensively-glazed nose affording excellent visibility. It had a low wing on which the engine nacelles were mounted, and a conventional tail. The main undercarriage was retractable but the tailwheel was fixed.

==Operational history==
Ae-45 prototypes were widely advertised abroad. In August 1949 Jan Anderle won the Norton Griffiths Race in Great Britain (Ae-45 registration OK-DCL). They also set several international records. As a result, apart from Eastern Bloc countries, the plane was also bought by Italy and Switzerland. On 10–11 August 1958 Dr. Pier Paolo Brielli flew an Italian Ae-45 3000 kilometers from South America to Dakar across the southern Atlantic (as the first Czechoslovak-built aircraft). In 1981 Jon Svensen flew Ae-45S from Europe to the USA.

This type was used in Czechoslovakia and was exported to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, East Germany, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Soviet Union and Switzerland. Hungary was a major customer, where the aircraft was known as the &quot;Kócsag&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Egret&quot;).

<text>Praful Manoharbhai Patel (born 17 February 1957) is an Indian politician, industrialist and sports administrator. He is associated with the Nationalist Congress Party. 

He was the president of India&#x27;s association football governing body the All India Football Federation (AIFF) from 2009 until 2022 when the Committee of Administrators (CoA) took over the interim administration following the appointment by the Supreme Court. He became the Asian Football Confederation&#x27;s vice president of the SAFF region at the AFC Congress held in Bahrain in 2015. In December 2016, he was appointed the Senior Vice President of the Asian Football Confederation. In 2017, he became a member of a FIFA Finance Committee for a term of four years. He also serves as the President of the Western India Football Association, the state football governing body of Maharashtra.

On the 25th anniversary of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Party Chief Sharad Pawar appointed Praful Patel and Supriya Sule as working presidents of the Party. 

==Early life and education==
Praful Patel is the son of Indian National Congress politician Manoharbhai Patel, who represented Gondia in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. His father died when Patel was 13. His family is Gujarati and runs the Ceejay Group, a tobacco conglomerate.

Patel attended Mumbai&#x27;s Campion School, and the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Bombay.

==Career==

===Political career===
Patel followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps in choosing a political career. In 1985, he became the president of the Gondia Municipal Council, and in the 1991 Indian general election was elected to the 10th Lok Sabha. In 1996 and 1998 he was re-elected to the 11th Lok Sabha and 12th Lok Sabha respectively. Patel has served on a number of parliamentary committees, including the Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (1991–1996), the Committee on Science and Technology (1994–1995), the Committee on Home Affairs (1995–1996), the Committee on Finance (1996–97), and the Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a representative of Maharashtra in 2000. He was re-elected to the Rajya Sabha for his second term in 2006, and in the 2009 was elected to the 15th Lok Sabha for a fourth term. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra in 2016.

From 2004 to 2011, Patel was served as the Minister of Civil Aviation. In this role, the government increased the foreign direct investment cap in the domestic airlines sector from 40% to 49%. On 19 January 2011, Patel was relieved of Civil Aviation portfolio and became the cabinet minister for Minister of the Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises.

On 9 January 2013, Patel launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 roadmap for introducing electric and hybrid vehicles in India. Patel launched a project to build the world&#x27;s largest solar power plant near Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan. The project was planned to generate roughly 4000 MW of power, but following protest from environmental groups, the project site was moved to Kharaghoda in Surendranagar district of Gujarat.

===AIFF President===
In 2013, Patel placed a bid for India to host the 2015 and 2016 FIFA World Club Championships.

Under Patel, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) introduced the Indian Super League run by the Football Sports Development Pvt Ltd., which aims to make Indian football more competitive at an international level. In April 2014, Patel announced the eight franchise owners in the Indian Super League.

Patel signed agreements with the German Football Association (DFB), the French Football Federation (FFF) and the Japan Football Association (JFA) in 2015 for their support and expertise for the &quot;mutual growth, promotion and continuous emphasis on the development of football.&quot;

Patel brought back international friendlies to India, with Mumbai awarded its first international match in 61 years when India hosted Puerto Rico in 2016. Praful has said that India will host more friendly matches in the future.

On 28 March 2016, Patel announced the commencement of a women&#x27;s league later in 2016. In a Special General Body Meeting of the AIFF held in New Delhi, a women&#x27;s league was introduced in line with Patel&#x27;s plans to place more emphasis on women&#x27;s football. On 17 October 2016, the women&#x27;s football league trial kicked off for the first time in India in the city of Cuttack. On 24 January 2017 AIFF President Praful Patel launched the inaugural edition of the Indian Women&#x27;s League at New Delhi. The league will commence from 28 January with six teams participating in it.

On 1 December 2016, Patel was appointed the senior vice president of the Asian Football Confederation. India subsequently won the rights to host the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017 and hosted the AFC U-16 Championship in September 2016. The All India Football Federation has also won the AFC Developing Member Association of the Year Award at the AFC&#x27;s Annual Awards 2016 held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

On 21 January 2016, Praful Patel was elected unopposed as the AIFF President for the third consecutive term.

Patel was removed from his presidency of the AIFF by the Supreme Court and replaced by a Committee of Administrators (CoA) after failing to organise presidential elections despite his third term expiring in December 2020.

====Alleged role in AIFF&#x27;s suspension by FIFA====
In August 2022, FIFA suspended the All India Football Federation for violating its statutes on third-party interference. India was stripped of its hosting rights for international football tournaments, including the 2022 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup scheduled for October 2022. Patel who had stayed in office as the AIFF president despite his third term expiring in December 2020 had been replaced by a Supreme Court appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA). Patel was accused of orchestrating the AIFF&#x27;s suspension by arranging a letter from FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation threatening AIFF with a suspension if he wasn&#x27;t restored to its presidency. The Supreme Court dissolved the CoA and restored day-to-day management to the AIFF on 22 August. FIFA lifted its suspension of the AIFF on 26 August, and restored the rights to the U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

===Memberships and chairman positions===
Patel is chairman of the Manoharbhai Patel Charitable Trust, which funds the Manoharbhai Patel Institute of Engineering and Technology, the president of the Gondia Education Society, the Gondwana Club, Nagpur Lions International Club and the Cricket Club of Mumbai.

<doc id="951393" wikidata="Q614263" url="?curid=951393" title="Filial piety">
<text>Filial piety is the virtue of exhibiting love and respect for one&#x27;s parents, elders, and ancestors, particularly within the context of Confucian, Chinese Buddhist, and Daoist ethics. The Confucian &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;, thought to be written around the late Warring States-Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of filial piety. The book—a purported dialogue between Confucius and his student Zengzi—is about how to set up a good society using the principle of filial piety. Filial piety is central to Confucian role ethics.

In more general terms, filial piety means to be good to one&#x27;s parents; to take care of one&#x27;s parents; to engage in good conduct, not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one&#x27;s parents and ancestors; to show love, respect, and support; to display courtesy; to ensure male heirs; to uphold fraternity among brothers; to wisely advise one&#x27;s parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; to display sorrow for their sickness and death; and to bury them and carry out sacrifices after their death.

Filial piety is considered a key virtue in Chinese and other East Asian cultures, and it is the main subject of many stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is &quot;The Twenty-four Cases of Filial Piety&quot;. These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety customs in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, the custom of filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the one element common to almost all Chinese people.

== Terminology ==
The western term &quot;filial piety&quot; was originally derived from studies of Western societies, based on Mediterranean cultures. However, filial piety among the ancient Romans, for example, was largely different from the Chinese in its logic and enactment. Filial piety is illustrated by the Chinese character (孝). The character is a combination of the character (old) above the character (son), that is, an elder being carried by a son. This indicates that the older generation should be supported by the younger generation. 

In Korean Confucianism, the character is pronounced (). In Vietnamese, the character is written in the Vietnamese alphabet as . In Japanese, the term is generally rendered in spoken and written language as () adding the characters for &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;conduct&quot; to the Chinese character to make the word more specific.

== In traditional texts ==
=== Definitions ===
Confucian teachings about filial piety can be found in numerous texts, including the Four Books, that is the &quot;Great Learning&quot; (), the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; (), &quot;Analects&quot; (), and the book &quot;Mencius&quot;, as well as the works &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot; () and the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; (). In the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;, Confucius () says that &quot;filial piety is the root of virtue and the basis of philosophy&quot; and modern philosopher Fung Yu-lan describes filial piety as &quot;the ideological basis for traditional [Chinese] society&quot;.

For Confucius, filial piety is not merely a ritual outside respect to one&#x27;s parents, but an inward attitude as well. Filial piety consists of several aspects. Filial piety is an awareness of repaying the burden borne by one&#x27;s parents. As such, filial piety is done to reciprocate the care one&#x27;s parents have given. However, it is also practiced because of an obligation towards one&#x27;s ancestors.

According to some modern scholars, is the root of (; benevolence, humaneness), but other scholars state that , as well as (; righteousness) and (; propriety) should be interpreted as the roots of . means favorable behavior to those whom we are close to. refers to respect to those considered worthy of respect, such as parents and superiors. is defined as behaving according to social norms and cultural values. Moreover, it is defined in the texts as &quot;deference&quot;, which is respectful submission, and &quot;reverence&quot;, meaning deep respect and awe. Filial piety was taught by Confucius as part of a broad ideal of self-cultivation () toward being a perfect human being.

Modern philosopher Hu Shih argued that filial piety gained its central role in Confucian ideology only among later Confucianists. He proposed that Confucius originally taught the quality of in general, and did not yet emphasize as much. Only later Confucianists such as Tseng Tzu focused on as the single most important Confucianist quality.

=== Detailed descriptions ===
Confucian ethics does not regard filial piety as a choice, but rather as an unconditional obligation of the child. The relationship between parents and children is the most fundamental of the five cardinal relationships () described by Confucius in his role ethics. Filial piety, together with fraternal love, underlies this system. It is the fundamental principle of Confucian morality: filial piety was seen as the basis for an orderly society, together with loyalty of the ministers toward the ruler, and servitude of the wife toward the husband. In short, filial piety is central to Confucian role ethics and is the cardinal virtue that defines, limits, or even overrides all other virtues.

According to the traditional texts, filial piety consists of physical care, love, service, respect, and obedience. Children should attempt not to bring disgrace upon their parents. Confucian texts such as &quot;Book of Rites&quot; give details on how filial piety should be practiced. Respect is envisioned by detailed manners such as the way children salute their parents, speak to them (words and tone used), or enter and leave the room in which their parents are, as well as seating arrangements and gifts. Care means making sure parents are comfortable in every single way: this involves food, accommodation, clothes, hygiene, and basically to have them &quot;see and hear pleasurable things&quot; (in Confucius&#x27; words) and to have them live without worry. But the most important expressions of, and exercises in, filial piety were the burial and mourning rituals to be held in honor of one&#x27;s parents.

Filial piety means to be good to one&#x27;s parents; to take care of one&#x27;s parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one&#x27;s parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one&#x27;s job well (preferably the same job as one&#x27;s parents to fulfill their aspirations); to carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; to not be rebellious; to be polite and well-mannered; to show love, respect, and support; to be near home to serve one&#x27;s parents; to display courtesy; to ensure male heirs; to uphold fraternity among brothers; to wisely advise one&#x27;s parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; to display sorrow for their sickness and death; and to bury them and carry out sacrifices after their death. Furthermore, a filial child should promote the public name of its family, and it should cherish the affection of its parents.

Traditional texts essentially describe filial piety in terms of a son-father relationship, but in practice, it involves all parent-child relationships, as well as relationships with stepparents, grandparents, and ancestors.

Filial piety also involves the role of the parent to the child. The father has a duty to provide for the son, to teach him in traditions of ancestor worship, to find a spouse for him, and to leave a good heritage. A father is supposed to be &quot;stern and dignified&quot; to his children, whereas a mother is supposed to be &quot;gentle and compassionate&quot;. The parents&#x27; virtues are to be practiced, regardless of the child&#x27;s piety, and vice versa. Nevertheless, filial piety mostly identified the &#x27;s duty, and in this, it differed from the Roman concept of , which defined mostly the father&#x27;s authoritative power. Whereas in Roman culture, and later in the Judeo-Christian West, people in authority legitimized their influence by referring to a higher transcending power, in Chinese culture, authority was defined by the roles of the subordinates (son, subject, wife) to their superior (father, emperor, husband) and vice versa. As roles and duties were depersonalized, supremacy became a matter of role and position, rather than person, as it was in the West.

Anthropologist Francis Hsu argued that a child&#x27;s obedience from a Confucian perspective was regarded as unconditional, but anthropologist David K. Jordan and psychologist David Yau-fai Ho disagree. Jordan states that in classical Chinese thought, &quot;remonstrance&quot; was part of filial piety, meaning that a pious child needs to dissuade a parent from performing immoral actions. Ho points out in this regard that the Confucian classics do not advocate &quot;foolish filial piety&quot; ( ). However, Jordan adds that if the parent does not listen to the child&#x27;s dissuasion, the child must still obey the parent, and Ho states that &quot;rebellion or outright defiance&quot; is never approved in Confucian ethics.

Filial piety not only extends to behavior of children toward their parents, but also involves gratitude toward the human body they received from their parents, as the body is seen as an extension of one&#x27;s parents. This involves prohibitions on damaging or hurting the body, and this doctrine has affected how the Confucianists regarded the shaving of the head by Buddhist monks, but also has created a taboo on suicide, regarded as &quot;unfilial behavior&quot; ( ).

=== Relation with society at large ===

Filial piety is regarded as a principle that ordered society, without which chaos would prevail. It is described as &quot;an inevitable fact of nature&quot;, as opposed to mere convention, and it is seen to follow naturally out of the father-son relationship. In the Chinese tradition of patriarchy, roles are upheld to maintain the harmony of the whole. According to the Neo-Confucian philosopher Cheng Hao (), relationships and their corresponding roles &quot;belong to the eternal principle of the cosmos from which there is no escape between heaven and earth&quot;.

The idea of filial piety became popular in China because of the many functions it had and many roles it undertook, as the traditional Confucian scholars such as Mencius () regarded the family as a fundamental unit that formed the root of the nation. Though the virtue of was about respect by children toward their parents, it was meant to regulate how the young generation behaved toward elders in the extended family and in society in general. Furthermore, devotion to one&#x27;s parents was often associated with one&#x27;s devotion to the state, described as the &quot;parallel conception of society&quot; or the &quot;Model of Two&quot;. The &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot; states that an obedient and filial son will grow up to become a loyal official ()—filial piety was therefore seen as a truth that shaped the citizens of the state, and the loyalty of the minister to his emperor was regarded as the extension of filial piety. Filial piety was regarded as being a dutiful person in general.

Nevertheless, the two were not equated. Mencius teaches that ministers should overthrow an immoral tyrant, should he harm the state; the loyalty to the king was considered conditional, not as unconditional as in filial piety towards one parents.

== In East Asian languages and cultures ==
Confucian teachings about filial piety have left their mark on East Asian languages and culture. In Chinese, there is a saying that &quot;among hundreds of behaviors, filial piety is the most important one&quot; ().

In modern Chinese, filial piety is rendered with the words (), meaning &quot;respect and obedience&quot;. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the one element common to almost all Chinese people. Historian Ch&#x27;ü T&#x27;ung-tsu stated about the codification of patriarchy in Chinese law that &quot;[i]t was all a question of filial piety&quot;. Filial piety also forms the basis for the veneration of the aged, for which the Chinese are known. However, filial piety among the Chinese has led them to be mostly focused on taking care of close kin, and be less interested in wider issues of more distant people: nevertheless, this should not be mistaken for individualism.

In Japan, devotion to kinship relations was and still is much more broadly construed, involving more than just kin.

In Korean culture, filial piety is also of crucial importance. However, filial piety in the later Joseon dynasty, created a tension for women on marriage, between &quot;filial values&quot; and &quot;filial emotions&quot; during the later Joseon dynasty, since women, on marrying, owed their filial piety to their husband&#x27;s family and not to their birth family. These tensions and the normative values of this neo-Confucian patrilineal and patriarchal society are evidenced in &quot;pansori&quot; and the many versions of various moral tales. Books published on filial piety include &quot;Hyohaengrok&quot; (효행록) first published in late Goryeo times and revised and republished in 1428, and the &quot;Register of Loyalty and Filial Piety (1655-1788)&quot; (효행등제등록) a register of those receiving government rewards for filial piety from 1655 to 1788. 

In Taiwan, filial piety is considered one of eight important virtues, among which filial piety is considered supreme. It is &quot;central in all thinking about human behavior&quot;. Taiwan generally has more traditional values with regard to the parent-child relationship than the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). This is reflected in attitudes about how desirable it is for the elderly to live independently.

== In behavioral sciences ==

Social scientists have researched filial piety and related concepts. It is a highly influential factor in studies about Asian families and in intergenerational studies, as well as studies on socialization patterns. Filial piety is defined by several scholars as the recognition by children of the aid and care their parents have given them, and the respect returned by those children. Psychologist K.S. Yang defined it as a &quot;specific, complex syndrome or set of cognition, affects, intentions, and behaviors concerning being good or nice to one&#x27;s parents&quot;. , psychologists measured filial piety in inconsistent ways, which makes it difficult to progress.

Filial piety is defined by behaviors such as daily maintenance, respect, and sickness care offered to the elderly. Although in scholarly literature five forms of reverence have been described, multi-cultural researcher Kyu-taik Sung added eight more to that, to cover the traditional definitions of elder respect in Confucian texts:

These forms of respect are based on qualitative research. Some of these forms involve some action or work, whereas other forms are more symbolic. Female elders tend to receive more care respect, whereas male elders tend to receive more symbolic respect.

Apart from attempting to define filial piety, psychologists have also attempted to explain its cognitive development. Psychologist R.M. Lee distinguishes a five-fold development, which he bases on Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s theory of moral development. In the first stage, filial piety is comprehended as just the giving of material things, whereas in the second stage this develops into an understanding that emotional and spiritual support is more important. In the third stage, the child realizes that filial piety is crucial in establishing and keeping parent-child relationships; in the fourth stage, this is expanded to include relationships outside of one&#x27;s family. In the final stage, filial piety is regarded as a means to realize one&#x27;s ethical ideals.
Psychologists have found between filial piety and lower socio-economic status, female gender, elders, minorities, and non-westernized cultures. Traditional filial piety beliefs have been connected with positive outcomes for the community and society, care for elder family members, positive family relationships, and solidarity. Filial piety has also been related to an orientation to the past, resistance to cognitive change, superstition and fatalism, dogmatism, authoritarianism, conformism, a belief in the superiority of one&#x27;s culture, and a lack of active, critical, and creative learning attitudes. Ho connects the value of filial piety with authoritarian moralism and cognitive conservatism in Chinese patterns of socialization, basing this on findings among subjects in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He defines &quot;authoritarian moralism&quot; as hierarchical authority ranking in family and institutions, and pervasive use of moral precepts as criteria of measuring people. &quot;Cognitive moralism&quot; he derives from social psychologist Anthony Greenwald, and is a &quot;disposition to preserve existing knowledge structures&quot; and resistance to change. He concludes that filial piety appears to have a negative effect on psychological development, but at the same time, partly explains the high motivation of Chinese people to achieve academic results.

In family counselling research, filial piety has been seen to help establish bonding with parents. Ho argues that filial piety brings along an obligation to raise one&#x27;s children in a moral way to prevent disgrace to the family. However, filial piety has also been found to perpetuate dysfunctional family patterns such as child abuse: there may be both positive and negative psychological effects. Francis Hsu argued that pro-family attitudes informed by filial piety, when taken on the level of the family at large, can lead to nepotism and corruption, and are at tension with the good of the state as whole.

In Chinese parent-child relations, the aspect of authority goes hand-in-hand with the aspect of benevolence. For example, many Chinese parents support their children&#x27;s education fully and do not allow their children to work during their studies, which allows them to focus on their studies. Because of this combination of benevolence and authoritarianism in such relations, children feel obliged to respond to parents&#x27; expectations, and internalize them. Ho found, however, that in Chinese parent-child relations, fear also contributed to meeting parents&#x27; filial expectations: children may not internalize their parents&#x27; expectations, but rather perform as good children in a detached way, through affect-role dissociation. Studying Korean family relations, scholar Dawnhee Yim argues that internalization of parents&#x27; obligations by children may lead to guilt, as well as suppression of hostile thoughts toward parents, leading to psychological problems. Jordan found that despite filial piety being asymmetrical in nature, Chinese interviewees felt that filial piety contained an element of reciprocity: &quot;...it is easy to see the parent whom one serves today as the self who is served tomorrow.&quot; Furthermore, the practice of filial piety provides the pious child with a sense of adulthood and moral heroism.

== History ==
=== Pre-Confucian history ===

The origins of filial piety in East Asia lie in ancestor worship, and can already be found in the pre-Confucian period. Epigraphical findings such as oracle bones contain references to filial piety. Texts such as the &quot;Classic of Changes&quot; () may contain early references to the parallel conception of the filial son and the loyal minister.

=== Early Confucianism ===

In the Tang dynasty (6th–10th century), not performing filial piety was declared illegal, and even earlier, during the Han dynasty (2nd century BCE–3rd century CE), this was punished by beheading. Behavior regarded as unfilial such as mistreating or abandoning one&#x27;s parents or grandparents, or refusing to complete the mourning period for them, was punished by exile and beating, or worse.

From the Han dynasty onward, the practice of mourning rites came to be seen as the cornerstone of filial piety and was strictly practiced and enforced. This was a period of unrest, and the state promoted the practice of long-term mourning to reestablish its authority. Filial piety toward one&#x27;s parents was expected to lead to loyalty to the ruler, expressed in the Han proverb &quot;The Emperor rules all-under-heaven with filial piety&quot;. Government officials were expected to take leave for a mourning period of two years after their parents died. Local officials were expected to encourage filial piety to one&#x27;s parents—and by extension, to the state—by behaving as an example of such piety. The king himself would express filial piety in an exemplary way, through the ritual of &quot;serving the elderly&quot; (). Nearly all Han emperors had the word in their temple name. The promotion of filial piety in this manner, as part of the idea of , was a less confrontational way to create order in society than resorting to law.

Filial piety was a keystone of Han morality.

During the early Confucian period, the principles of filial piety were brought back by Japanese and Korean students to their respective homelands, where they became central to the education system. In Japan, rulers gave awards to people deemed to practice exemplary filial conduct.

During the Mongolian rule in the Yuan dynasty (13th–14th century), the practice of filial piety was perceived to deteriorate. In the Ming dynasty (14th–17th century), emperors and literati attempted to revive the customs of filial piety. Though in that process, filial piety was reinterpreted, as rules and rituals were modified. Even on the grassroots level a revival was seen, as vigilante societies started to promote Confucian values. Members of this vigilance movement composed the book &quot;The Twenty-four Cases of Filial Piety&quot;.

=== Introduction of Buddhism ===
Filial piety has been an important aspect of Buddhist ethics since early Buddhism, and was essential in the apologetics and texts of Chinese Buddhism. In the Early Buddhist Texts such as the Nikāyas and Āgamas, filial piety is prescribed and practiced in three ways: to repay the gratitude toward one&#x27;s parents; as a good karma or merit; and as a way to contribute to and sustain the social order. Buddhist scriptures portray the Buddha and his disciples practicing filial piety toward their parents, based on the qualities of gratitude and reciprocity.

Initially, scholars of Buddhism like Kenneth Ch&#x27;en saw Buddhist teachings on filial piety as a distinct feature of Chinese Buddhism. Later scholarship, led by people such as John Strong and Gregory Schopen, has come to believe that filial piety was part of Buddhist doctrine since early times. Strong and Schopen provided epigraphical and textual evidence to show that early Buddhist laypeople, monks, and nuns often displayed strong devotion to their parents, and concluded that filial piety was already an important part of the devotional life of early Buddhists.

When Buddhism was introduced in China, it had no organized celibacy. Confucianism emphasized filial piety to parents and loyalty to the emperor, and Buddhist monastic life was seen to go against its tenets. In the 3rd–5th century CE, as criticism of Buddhism increased, Buddhist monastics and lay authors responded by writing about and translating Buddhist doctrines and narratives that supported filial piety, comparing them to Confucianism and thereby defending Buddhism and its value in society. The &quot;Mouzi Lihuolun&quot; referred to Confucian and Daoist classics, as well as historical precedents to respond to critics of Buddhism. The &quot;Mouzi&quot; stated that while on the surface the Buddhist monk seems to reject and abandon his parents, he is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on the path towards enlightenment. Sun Chuo () further argued that monks were working to ensure the salvation of all people and making their family proud by doing so, and Liu Xie stated that Buddhists practiced filial piety by sharing merit with their departed relatives. Buddhist monks were also criticized for not expressing their respect to the Chinese emperor by prostrating and other devotion, which in Confucianism was associated with the virtue of filial piety. Huiyuan (334–416) responded that although monks did not express such piety, they did pay homage in heart and mind; moreover, their teaching of morality and virtue to the public helped support imperial rule.

From the 6th century onward, Chinese Buddhists realized they had to stress Buddhism&#x27;s own particular ideas about filial piety in order for Buddhism to survive. Śyāma, Sujāti, and other Buddhist stories of self-sacrifice spread a belief that a filial child should even be willing to sacrifice its own body. The &quot;Ullambana Sūtra&quot; introduced the idea of transfer of merit through the story of &quot;Mulian Saves His Mother&quot; and led to the establishment of the Ghost Festival. By this Buddhists attempted to show that filial piety also meant taking care of one&#x27;s parents in the next life, not just this life. Furthermore, authors in China—and Tibet, and to some extent Japan—wrote that in Buddhism, all living beings have once been one&#x27;s parents, and that practicing compassion to all living beings as though they were one&#x27;s parents is the superior form of filial piety. Another aspect emphasized was the great suffering a mother goes through when giving birth and raising a child. Chinese Buddhists described how difficult it is to repay the goodness of one&#x27;s mother, and how many sins mothers committed in raising their children. The mother became the primary source of well-being and indebtedness for the son, which was in contrast with pre-Buddhist perspectives emphasizing the father. Nevertheless, although critics of Buddhism did not have much impact during this time, this changed in the period leading up to the Neo-Confucianist revival, when Emperor Wu Zong (841–845) started the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, citing lack of filial piety as one of his reasons for attacking Buddhist institutions.

Filial piety is still an important value in some Asian Buddhist cultures. In China, Buddhism continued to uphold a role in state rituals and mourning rites for ancestors until late imperial times (13th–20th century). &quot;Sūtras&quot; and narratives about filial piety are still widely used. The Ghost Festival is still popular in many Asian countries, especially those countries which are influenced by both Buddhism and Confucianism.

=== Late imperial period ===
During the 17th century, some missionaries tried to prevent Chinese people from worshiping their ancestors. This was regarded as an assault on Chinese culture.

During the Qing dynasty, however, filial piety was redefined by the Kangxi Emperor, who felt it more important that his officials were loyal to him than that they were filial sons. Civil servants were often not allowed to go on extended leave to perform mourning rituals for their parents. The parallel conception of society therefore disappeared from Chinese society.

Patriarchalism and its enactment in law grew more strict in late imperial China. The duties of the obedient child were much more precisely and rigidly prescribed, to the extent that legal scholar Hsu Dau-lin argued about this period that it &quot;engendered a highly authoritarian spirit which was entirely alien to Confucius himself&quot;. The late imperial Chinese held patriarchalism high as an organizing principle of society, as laws and punishments gradually became more strict and severe.

During the same time, in Japan, a classic work about filial practices was compiled, called &quot;Biographies of Japanese Filial Children&quot; ().

=== 19th–20th century ===
During the rise of progressivism and communism in China in the early 20th century, Confucian values and family-centered living were discouraged by the state and intellectuals. During the New Culture Movement of 1911, Chinese intellectuals and foreign missionaries attacked the principle of filial piety, the latter considering it an obstruction of progress.

In Japan, filial piety was not regarded as an obstacle to modernization, though scholars disagree about why this was so. Francis Hsu believed that &quot;the human networks through which it found concrete expressions&quot; were different in Japan, and there never was a movement against filial piety as there was in China.

The late imperial trend of increased patriarchalism made it difficult for the Chinese to build strong patrimonial groups that went beyond kin. Though filial piety was practiced much in both China and Japan, the Chinese way was more limited to close kin than in Japan. When industrialization increased, filial piety was therefore criticized more in China than in Japan, because China felt it limited the way the country could meet the challenges from the West. For this reason, China developed a more critical stance towards filial piety and other aspects of Confucianism than other East Asian countries, including not only Japan, but also Taiwan.

In the 1950s, Mao Zedong&#x27;s socialist measures led to the dissolution of family businesses and more dependence on the state; Taiwan&#x27;s socialism did not go as far in state control.

Ethnographic evidence from the 19th and early 20th century shows that Chinese people still very much cared for their elders, who very often lived with one or more married sons.

== Developments in modern society ==
In 21st-century Chinese societies, filial piety expectations and practice have decreased. One cause for this is the rise of the nuclear family without much coresidence with parents. Families are becoming smaller because of family planning and housing shortages. Other causes are individualism, the loss of status of the elderly, emigration of young people to cities, and the independence of young people and women. Amplifying this trend, the number of elderly people has increased quickly.

The relationship between husband and wife came to be more emphasized, and the extended family less so. Kinship ties between the husband and wife&#x27;s families have become more bilateral and equal. The way respect to elders is expressed is also changing. Communication with elders tends to become more reciprocal and less one-way, and kindness and courtesy is replacing obedience and subservience.

=== Care-giving ===

In modern Chinese societies, elder care has changed. Studies show a discrepancy between parents&#x27; filial expectations and the behaviors of their children. The discrepancy with regard to respect shown by the children makes elderly people especially unhappy. Industrialization and urbanization have affected the practice of filial piety, with care being given more in financial than in personal ways. , care-giving of elderly people by the young had not undergone any revolutionary changes in the PRC, and family obligations still remained strong, &quot;almost automatic&quot;. Respect to elders remains a central value for East Asian people.

Comparing data from the 1990s from Taiwan and the PRC, sociologist Martin Whyte concluded that the elderly in Taiwan often received less support from the government, but more assistance from their children, than in China.

=== Work ethos and business practices ===
In PRC business culture, filial piety is decreasing in influence. , western-style business practices and managerial style were promoted by the Chinese government to modernize the country. However in Japan employees usually regard their employer as a sort of father, to which they feel obliged to express filial devotion.

=== Relation with law ===

In some societies with large Chinese communities, legislation has been introduced to establish or uphold filial piety. In the 2000s, Singapore introduced a law that makes it an offense to refuse to support one&#x27;s elderly parents; Taiwan took similar punitive measures. Hong Kong, on the other hand, attempted to influence its population by providing incentives for fulfilling their obligations. For example, certain tax allowances are given to citizens who live with their elderly parents.

Some scholars argued that medieval China&#x27;s reliance on governance by filial piety formed a society that was better able to prevent crime and other misconduct than societies that did so only through legal means.

<doc id="951394" wikidata="Q3320530" url="?curid=951394" title="Rochdale Principles">
<text>The Rochdale Principles are a set of ideals for the operation of cooperatives. They were first set out in 1844 by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in Rochdale, England, and have formed the basis for the principles on which co-operatives around the world continue to operate. The implications of the Rochdale Principles are a focus of study in co-operative economics. The original Rochdale Principles were officially adopted by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) in 1937 as the Rochdale Principles of Co-operation. Updated versions of the principles were adopted by the ICA in 1966 as the Co-operative Principles and in 1995 as part of the Statement on the Co-operative Identity.

== Current ICA version of co-operative principles ==
The Rochdale Principles, according to the 1995 ICA revision, can be summarised as follows.

=== Voluntary and open membership ===
The first of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have an open and membership. According to the ICA&#x27;s Statement on the Co-operative Identity, &quot;Co-operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.&quot;

==== Anti-discrimination ====
To discriminate socially is to make a distinction between people on the basis of class or category. Examples of social discrimination include racial, casteist, religious, sexual, sexual orientation, disability, and ethnic discrimination. To fulfill the first Rochdale Principle, a co-operative society should not prevent anyone willing to participate from doing so on any of these grounds. However, this does not prohibit the co-operative from setting reasonable and relevant ground rules for membership, such as residing in a specific geographic area or paying a membership fee to join, so long as all persons meeting such criteria are able to participate if they so choose.

==== Motivations and rewards ====
Given the voluntary nature of co-operatives, members need reasons to participate. Each person&#x27;s motivations will be unique and will vary from one co-operative to another, but they will often be a combination of the following:
*Financial – Some co-operatives are able to provide members with financial benefits.
*Quality of life – Serving the community through a co-operative because doing service makes one&#x27;s own life better is perhaps the most significant motivation for volunteering. Included here would be the benefits people get from being with other people, staying active, and above all having a sense of the value of ourselves in society that may not be as clear in other areas of life.
*Giving back – Many people have in some way benefited from the work of a co-operative and volunteer to give back.
*Altruism – Some volunteer for the benefit of others.
*A sense of duty – Some see participation in community as a responsibility that comes with citizenship. In this case, they may not describe themselves as volunteers.
*Career experience – Volunteering offers experiences that can add to career prospects.

=== Democratic member control ===
The second of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have democratic member control. According to the ICA&#x27;s Statement on the Co-operative Identity, &quot;Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.&quot;

=== Member economic participation ===
Member economic participation is one of the defining features of co-operative societies, and constitutes the third Rochdale Principle in the ICA&#x27;s Statement on the Co-operative Identity. According to the ICA, co-operatives are enterprises in which &quot;Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.&quot; This principle, in turn, can be broken down into a number of constituent parts.

==== Democratic control ====
The first part of this principle states that &quot;Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative.&quot; This enshrines democratic control over the co-operative, and how its capital is used.

==== Limitations on member compensation and appropriate use of surpluses ====
The second part of the principle deals with how members are compensated for funds invested in a co-operative, and how surpluses should be used. Unlike for-profit corporations, co-operatives are a form of social enterprise. Given this, there are at least three purposes for which surplus funds can be used, or distributed, by a co-operative.
* &quot;Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership.&quot;
* &quot;Developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible;&quot; in other words, the surplus can be reinvested in the co-operative.
* &quot;Benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative;&quot; for example, a consumers&#x27; co-operative may decide to pay dividends based on purchases (or a &#x27;divvi&#x27;).
* &quot;Supporting other activities approved by the membership.&quot;

=== Autonomy and independence ===
The fourth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must be autonomous and independent. According to the ICA&#x27;s Statement on the Co-operative Identity, &quot;Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.&quot;

=== Education, training, and information ===
The fifth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must provide education and training to their members and the public. According to the ICA&#x27;s Statement on the Co-operative Identity, &quot;Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders – about the nature and benefits of co-operation.&quot;

=== Cooperation among cooperatives ===
The sixth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operatives cooperate with each other. According to the ICA&#x27;s Statement on the Co-operative Identity, &quot;Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.&quot;

=== Concern for community ===
The seventh of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have concern for their communities. According to the ICA&#x27;s Statement on the Co-operative Identity, &quot;Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.&quot;

== Previous versions ==

=== Original version (adopted 1937) ===
# Open membership.
# Democratic control (one person, one vote).
# Distribution of surplus in proportion to trade.
# Payment of limited interest on capital.
# Political and religious neutrality.
# Cash trading (no credit extended).
# Promotion of education.

=== ICA revision (1966) ===
At the 1963 Bournemouth Congress of the ICA, attendees appointed a second commission on the Rochdale principles, composed of one representative each from Great Britain, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, United States, and India. D.G. Karve, the representative from India, chaired the commission.
# Open, voluntary membership.
# Democratic governance.
# Limited return on equity.
# Surplus belongs to members.
# Education of members and public in cooperative principles.
# Cooperation between cooperatives.

<text>A bed is an item of furniture that is used as a place to sleep, rest, and relax.

Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame. The mattress rests either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a sprung base. Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people. While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, the trundle bed, which is stored under a low, twin-sized bed and can be rolled out to create a larger sleeping area, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers as well as a ladder to access the upper tier. Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock. Other beds are made specifically for animals.

Beds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards. &quot;Headboard only&quot; beds may incorporate a &quot;dust ruffle&quot;, &quot;bed skirt&quot;, or &quot;valance sheet&quot; to hide the bed frame. To support the head, a pillow made of a soft, padded material is usually placed on the top of the mattress. Some form of covering blanket is often used to insulate the sleeper, often bed sheets, a quilt, or a duvet, collectively referred to as bedding. Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, which enables these components to be washed or aired out.

==Etymology==

In Europe, mattresses were stuffed with straw, chaff, animal hair (for instance horsehair, used for its resilience), coarse wool, or down feathers, and stacked, softest topmost. This pile of mattresses, and the sheets, blanket, and pillows, was what early Europeans called a &quot;bed&quot;; it might be packed away during the day (a usage which survives in words like ). The bedframe, even when present, supported the bed, but was not considered part of it. Later innovations made bedframes more portable, and increased their importance.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
In August 2020 scientists reported the discovery of the oldest grass bedding from at least 200,000 years ago, much older than the oldest previously known bedding. They speculate that insect-repellent plants and ash layers, sometimes due to burned older grass beddings, found beneath the bedding have been used for a dirt-free, insulated base and to keep away arthropods.

=== Ancient history ===
Early beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried bracken). An important change was raising them off the ground, to avoid drafts, dirt, and pests. In the Miocene period, lasting from twenty-three to five million years ago, before the emergence of humans, apes began creating beds composed of a sleeping platform including a wooden pillow.

==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
Bedding dated around to 3600 BC was discovered in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. The bedding consists of sedge and other monocotyledons topped with the leaves of &quot;Cryptocarya woodii&quot;.

==== Europe ====
Beds found in a preserved northern Scottish village, which were raised boxes made of stone and likely topped with comfortable fillers, were dated to between 3200 BC and 2200 BC.

The &quot;Odyssey&quot;, an ancient Greek epic poem, describes the bed of its protagonist, Odysseus, and explains that he crafted the bed for himself and his wife, Penelope, out of a huge olive tree trunk that used to grow on the spot. The poem&#x27;s author, Homer, also mentions the inlaying of the woodwork of the bed with gold, silver, and ivory.

Ancient Roman mattresses were stuffed with reeds, hay, or wool. Feathers were used towards the end of the Republic, when custom demanded luxury. Small cushions were placed at the head and sometimes at the back. The bedsteads were high and could only be ascended by the help of steps. They were often arranged for two people, and had a board or railing at the back, as well as the raised portion at the head. The counterpanes were sometimes very costly, generally purple embroidered with figures in gold; and rich hangings fell to the ground masking the front. The bedsteads themselves were often of bronze inlaid with silver, and Elagabalus had one of solid silver. In the walls of some houses at Pompeii bed niches are found which were probably closed by curtains or sliding partitions. Ancient Romans had various kinds of beds for repose. These included:

* &quot;lectus cubicularis&quot;, or chamber bed, for normal sleeping
* &quot;lectus genialis&quot;, the marriage bed, it was much decorated, and was placed in the atrium opposite the door
* &quot;lectus discubitorius&quot;, or table bed, on which they ate—for they ate while lying on their left sides—there usually being three people to one bed, with the middle place accounted the most honorable position
* &quot;lectus lucubratorius&quot;, for studying
* and a &quot;lectus funebris&quot;, or &quot;emortualis&quot;, on which the dead were carried to the pyre

The Greeks and Romans were also having their meals in bed. They would recline on one side and reach out to pick up food from a nearby table.

==== Near East ====
The Egyptians had high bedsteads which were ascended by steps, with bolsters or pillows, and curtains to hang around. The elite of Egyptian society such as its pharaohs and queens even had beds made of wood, sometimes gilded. Often there was a head-rest as well, semi-cylindrical and made of stone, wood, or metal. Ancient Assyrians, Medes, and Persians had beds of a similar kind, and frequently decorated their furniture with inlays or appliques of metal, mother-of-pearl, and ivory.

===Medieval history===
In the early Middle Ages they laid carpets on the floor or on a bench against the wall, placed upon them were mattresses stuffed with feathers, wool, or hair, and used skins as a covering. Curtains were hung from the ceiling or from an iron arm projecting from the wall. They appear to have generally lain naked in bed, wrapping themselves in large linen sheets which were stretched over the cushions.

In the 12th century, luxury increased and bedsteads were made of wood much decorated with inlaid, carved, and painted ornamentation. They also used folding beds, which served as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon leather. At night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed, while silk-covered skins served as coverlets. The Carolingian manuscripts show metal bedsteads much higher at the head than at the feet, and this shape continued in use until the 13th century in France, many cushions being added to raise the body to a sloping position. In 12th-century manuscripts, the bedsteads appear much richer, with inlays, carving, and painting, and with embroidered coverlets and mattresses in harmony. Curtains were hung above the bed and a small hanging lamp is often shown.

In the 14th century the woodwork became of less importance, generally being entirely covered by hangings of rich materials. Silk, velvet, and even cloth of gold were frequently used. Inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give details of these hangings lined with fur and richly embroidered. It was then that the Four poster bed (also known as a &quot;tester bed&quot;) made its first appearance, the bed being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls, a form which developed later into a room within a room, shut in by double curtains, sometimes even to exclude all drafts. The space between the bed and the wall was called the &quot;ruelle&quot;, and very intimate friends were received there. The 14th century was also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions. Beds in aristocratic residences can be distinguished by enclosed curtains, these beds would have mattresses and pillows that were filled with feathers. Sheets were made of linen and blankets of wool. Rails attached to the beds would be for hanging clothes or to hold candles. In less wealthy houses, the bed would be made of three planks and a mattress made of dried heather or fern, they would sleep with a single sheet and an old blanket.

In the 15th century beds became very large, reaching by . The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers. At this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them, including beds and bed hangings, and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods.

===Modern history===

In the 17th century, which has been called &quot;the century of magnificent beds&quot;, the style &quot;à la duchesse&quot;, with tester and curtains only at the head, replaced the more enclosed beds in France, though they lasted much longer in England. Louis XIV had an enormous number of sumptuous beds, as many as 413 being described in the inventories of his palaces. Some of them had embroideries enriched with pearls, and figures on a silver or golden ground. The great bed at Versailles had crimson velvet curtains on which &quot;The Triumph of Venus&quot; was embroidered. So much gold was used that the velvet scarcely showed. 
In the 18th century feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany, which in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected with the bedchamber followed France for the most part. The beds were &quot;a la duchesse&quot;, but in France itself there was great variety both of name and shape. The custom of the &quot;bed of justice&quot; upon which the king of France reclined when he was present in parliament, the princes being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the throne.

Louis XI is credited with its first use and the custom lasted until the end of the monarchy. In the &quot;chambre de parade&quot;, where the ceremonial bed was placed, certain persons, such as ambassadors or great lords, whom it was desired to honour, were received in a more intimate fashion than the crowd of courtiers. At Versailles women received their friends in their beds, both before and after childbirth, during periods of mourning, and even directly after marriage—in fact in any circumstances which were thought deserving of congratulation or condolence. During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France until the end of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. The earliest of which mention has been found belonged to Charles the Bold. They had curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds.

Iron beds appear in the 18th century; the advertisements declare them as free from the insects which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads. Elsewhere, there was also the closed bed with sliding or folding shutters, and in England—where beds were commonly quite simple in form—the four poster was the usual citizen&#x27;s bed until the middle of the 19th century.

==Bed sizes==
Bed sizes vary considerably around the world, with most countries having their own standards and terminology.

==Notable examples==
One of the largest beds in the world is the Great Bed of Ware, made in about 1580. It is wide, long. The bed is mentioned by Shakespeare in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. It is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) in London. Another bed in the V&amp;A is the Golden Bed created by William Burges in 1879.

In 1882, Nawab of Bahawalpur Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abassi IV had a bed made of dark wood ornamented with of sterling silver. At each corner of the bed there was a life-sized bronze statue of a naked woman holding a fan. When the Nawab lay on the bed, his weight started a mechanism that made the women wave their fans and started a music box playing selections from Gounod&#x27;s Faust.

In 1865, a convertible bed in the form of an upright piano was available, which could provide home entertainment while saving space.
==Types==


There are many varieties of beds:
*An adjustable bed is a bed that can be adjusted to a number of different positions. Most hospital beds are adjustable, so that a patient can have different parts of their body elevated for medical reasons. Some people have adjustable beds in private homes. Some adjustable beds are designed for couples; they use two separate mattresses and adjustment mechanisms. This permits one partner to be lying flat to sleep while the other has the head and shoulders elevated to watch television or read. Couple adjustable beds also permit partners with different medical conditions to select a mattress positioning that best suits them.
*An air bed uses an air-inflated mattress, sometimes connected to an electric air pump and having variable, firmness controls. The portable version of an air bed can also be rolled up and packed; so is meant for travel or temporary guest use.
*A bassinet is a bed specifically for newborns.
*A box-bed is a bed having the form of a large box with wooden roof, sides, and ends, opening in front with two sliding panels or shutters; often used in cottages in Scotland: sometimes also applied to a bed arranged to fold up into a box.
*A brass bed has a frame constructed from brass. A brass-plated bed is a cheaper bed of iron with a thin covering of brass, which with time peels off and the iron is exposed.
*A bunk bed is two or more beds one atop the other. Bunk beds are used for adults in military barracks and in some ski lodges. Bunk beds are used for children and teens in summer camps. Some inexpensive hostels provide bunk beds for guests. Bunk beds are used for children in private homes.
*A loft bed is similar to a bunk bed, except there is no lower bunk. This leaves space underneath for storage, other furniture, a desk etc.
*A captain&#x27;s bed (also known as a &quot;captain bed&quot;, &quot;chest bed&quot;, or &quot;cabin bed&quot;) is a platform bed with drawers and storage compartments built in underneath.
*A camp bed (also &quot;cot&quot;, in American English) is a simple, temporary, portable bed used by armies and by campers. Camp beds are also used to provide a sleeping surface for refugees and other homeless people during disasters, floods, or other crises.
*A canopy bed is similar to a four poster bed, but the posts usually extend higher and are adorned or draped with cloth, sometimes completely enclosing the bed. Examples include the &quot;lit à la polonaise&quot; and the &quot;lit a la turque&quot;.
*A curtained bed is a luxury bed with curtains.
*A daybed is a couch that is used as a seat by day and as a bed by night. Usually it has pop up trundle which is used as bed in the night.
*A futon is a traditional style of Japanese bed using a mattress on a wooden frame. Futons are also available in a larger Western style which can fold halfway for sitting. Futons were traditionally made with cotton, but in the 2000s, many futons include synthetic foam.
*A four poster bed is a bed with four posts, one in each corner, that support a tester.
*A hammock is a piece of suspended fabric or netting, used on ships and in some homes. 
*A hideaway bed, invented by Sarah E. Goode in response to the needs of apartment-dwellers, folds up into another piece of furniture, such as a shelf or desk, when not in use.
*A hospital bed is specifically designed to facilitate convalescence, traditionally in a hospital or nursing facility, but increasingly in other settings, such as a private residence. Hospital beds are typically adjustable, so that the head or feet can be raised or lowered. Modern hospital beds commonly have wheels to assist in moderate relocation, but they are larger and generally more permanently placed than a trolley (US: gurney). The &quot;hospital bed&quot; is also a common unit of measurement for the capacity of any type of inpatient medical facility, though it is just as common to shorten the term to &quot;bed&quot; in that usage (e.g. &quot;The hospital has 250 beds...&quot;).
*An infant bed (also &quot;crib&quot; or &quot;cot&quot;) is a small bed specifically for babies and infants.
*An iron bed, developed in the 1850s, is constructed of iron and steel.
*A kang bed-stove is a Chinese ceramic room heater used as the platform for a bed.
*A Charpai is a traditional Punjabi bed made of tied ropes bordered by a wooden frame.
*A mourning bed (&quot;illustration&quot;) is a formal canopied bed, with the deceased, a wax effigy, or symbols of rank.
*A Murphy bed or wallbed is a bed that can fold up into a wall or cabinet to save space.
*An Ottoman bed (in the UK) is a type of storage bed in which the storage area is placed underneath the mattress base and accessed by lifting the hinged mattress frame with the help of a spring or hydraulic mechanism.
*A pallet is a thin, lightweight mattress.
*A platform bed is a mattress resting on a solid, flat raised surface, either free-standing or part of the structure of the room.
*A roll-away bed is a bed whose frame folds in half and rolls in order to be more easily stored and moved. This is used in different settings, including hotels for either free or a nominal fee per night, where more people than expected may need to sleep in the same room, e.g. 5 people in a hotel room for 4 (two twin beds). 
*A rope bed has a wooden frame within which crossing ropes, which may support a straw- or down-filled single mattress. See charpai.
*A slat bed is a flatpack bed with wooden slats for the bedbase.
*A sofabed (&quot;pull-out&quot; or &quot;pull-out bed&quot;) is a folding bed that is stored inside a sofa. Sofa beds are also called &quot;convertibles&quot; and &quot;hideaways.&quot;
*A state bed developed in Early Modern Europe from a hieratic canopy of state.
*A toddler bed is a small bed for young children.
*A trundle bed or &quot;truckle bed&quot; is a bed usually stored beneath another bed during the day. They have been in use for centuries. In the modern era they are sometimes referred to as a &quot;sleepover bed&quot; or &quot;daybed with pop up trundle.&quot;
*A vibrating bed (also known as a &quot;Magic Fingers&quot; bed) is typically a coin-operated novelty found in a vintage (-early 1980s) motel. For a nominal fee, the mattress vibrates for a duration of time. Alternatively it is a modern bed which vibrates by use of an off-centre motor. It is controlled by electronics for varying time and amplitude settings and is used therapeutically to ease back pains or as an erotic aid.
*A waterbed is a flexible plastic mattress full of water. The plastic container needs a strong frame around it.

==Frames==

Bed frames, also called bed steads, are made of wood or metal. The frame is made up of head, foot, and side rails. For heavy duty or larger frames (such as for queen- and king-sized beds), the bed frame also includes a center support rail. The rails are assembled to create a box for the mattress or mattress/box spring to sit on.

Types include:
* platform – typically used without a box spring.
* captain or storage– has drawers beneath the frame to make use of the space between the floor and the bed frame.
* waterbed – a heavy-duty frame built specifically to support the weight of the water in the mattress. (Mainly used on larger models)

Although not truly parts of a bed frame, headboards, footboards, and bed rails can be included in the definition. Headboards and footboards can be wood or metal. They can be stained, painted, or covered in fabric or leather.

Bed rails are made of wood or metal and are attached to a headboard and footboard. Wooden slats are placed perpendicular to the bed rails to support the mattress/mattress box spring. Bed rails and frames are often attached to the bed post using knock-down fittings. A knock-down fitting enables the bed to be easily dismantled for removal. Primary knock-down fittings for bed rails are as follows:

* Pin-and-hook fastener. A mortise or slot is cut vertically in the bedpost. Pins are inserted horizontally in the bed post so that the pins perpendicularly intersect the mortise. For example, if one looked in the mortise, one might see part of one horizontal pin at the bottom of the mortise and a part of a second pin toward the top of the mortise. Hooks are installed at the end of the rail. Usually these hooks are part of a plate that is attached to the rail. The hooks then are inserted into the bed post mortise and hook over the pins.
* Plate-and-hook fastener. Instead of pins inserted horizontally into the bedpost, an eye plate (post plate) is installed on the bedpost. The hooks are installed on the rail, either as surface mount or recessed. Depending on the hardware, the bedpost may require a mortise in order to allow the hooks to fasten to the plate. This is also referred to as a keyhole fastener, especially if the connector is more of a &quot;plug&quot; than a &quot;hook&quot;.
* Bed bolts (&quot;through-bolts&quot;), are a different means of a knock-down connection. A hole is typically drilled through the bedpost. The bolt head is inset and covered with a plug. In the rail, a dowel nut or other type of nut receives the bolt. The springs are made from metal, which are swirled for maximum comfort

Safety rails, or cot sides, can be added to the sides of a bed (normally a child or elderly person&#x27;s bed) to stop anyone falling out of the sides of the bed. A safety rail is normally a piece of wood that attaches to the side rails, on one or both sides of the bed. They are made so that they can be easily removed when no longer required.

<text>The Glenmore Reservoir is a large reservoir on the Elbow River in the southwest quadrant of Calgary, Alberta. It is controlled by the Glenmore Dam, a concrete gravity dam on the Elbow River. The Glenmore Reservoir is a primary source of drinking water to the city of Calgary. Built in 1932, with a cost of $3.8 million, the dam controls the downstream flow of the Elbow River, thus allowing the city to develop property near the river&#x27;s banks with less risk of flooding. 

The reservoir’s perimeter features a scenic, uninterrupted 16km multi-use pathway/pedestrian and cycling trail along the water’s edge, connecting popular city destinations such as the Heritage Marina beach, Heritage Park Historical Village, South Glenmore Park, Glenmore Sailing Club, Weaselhead Flats Natural Environment Park, North Glenmore Park, Calgary Canoe Club, Calgary Rowing Club, and the Earl Grey Golf Club .

The reservoir has a water mirror of and a drainage basin of . From 2017 to 2020, the City of Calgary rehabilitated and upgraded the Glenmore Dam at a cost of $81 million.

The reservoir is bordered to the west by the Tsuut’ina Nation reserve, to the north by the communities of Lakeview and North Glenmore, to the east by the neighbourhood Eagle Ridge (which sits on the peninsula alongside Heritage Park), and to the south by the communities of Oakridge, Palliser, and Pump Hill.

==History==

The Glenmore Reservoir is located on land originally settled by Calgary pioneer Sam Livingston, who gave the area the name &quot;Glenmore&quot; (Gaelic for &quot;big valley&quot;).

The City of Calgary began contemplating the need for a new source of drinking water in the early 1900s. City Alderman John Goodwin Watson proposed a gravity water supply fed from the Elbow River in April 1907. The issue of water scarcity and runoff continued to compound in the 1920s with the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; reporting the muddy conditions of the Elbow and Bow River in April 1926. The city retained Canadian architecture firm Gore, Naismith and Storrie to study the inadequate and frequently contaminated water supply in July 1929, with the firm recommending 12 remediation options, including the Glenmore Dam and Reservoir.

The City of Calgary would eventually receive approval for a dam and reservoir from the Government of Canada under the Irrigation Act in the late 1920s. The final step was approval from the electorate, which came in the form of a plebiscite during the 1929 Calgary municipal election. The electors of Calgary approved a bylaw to borrow $2.77-million for the project and other waterworks improvements.

With the necessary federal approval and financing in place, the city began purchasing land in the area necessary to complete the project. This including 539.5 acres from the Tsuu T&#x27;ina Nation (formerly the Sarcee Indian Reservation). The final price paid was $50 per acre, totaling $29,675. The purchase was negotiated by lawyer Leonard Brockington on behalf of the city. Brockington was known by the Tsuu T&#x27;ina Nation, and had previously been given the name &quot;Chief Yellow Coming Over the Hill&quot;, and as a condition of the sale, Brockington was bestowed the name &quot;Chief Weasel Head&quot; after the traditional name of the area to ensure the name would continue to live on. The city had independently valued the Tsuu T&#x27;ina land at $32,642.50, a difference of $2,596.50 over the final price. Other land owners in the area were paid between $111 and $400 per acre for the project.

Mayor Andrew Davison turned the first sod in a ceremony on July 26, 1930, to inaugurate the largest infrastructure project undertaken by the city to date. First concrete was poured on October 13, 1930, and in the fall of 1931 McDiarmid began construction of the water purification plant.

The expensive land purchases and growing cost of the project led to a judicial inquiry headed by Supreme Court of Alberta Justice Albert Ewing in 1932. The inquiry investigated all aspects of the project&#x27;s financing including land acquisitions, awarding of contracts, labour practices and management. The final report by Justice Ewing found no evidence of wrongdoing.

The dam was completed and became operational on January 19, 1933, which happened without an official ceremony. A public open house was held one week afterwards, which was attended by thousands of Calgarians.

When the area flooded (by the summer of 1933), part of the Livingston house was preserved and now stands in Heritage Park, which borders the reservoir.

The design estimated capacity for serving a population of 200,000, but by 1949 the system was reported as &quot;under near-constant strain&quot; with a population of 105,000 Calgarians. The city completed a $1.5-million filtration extension in 1957 which doubled the water capacity. Additional capacity was added again in 1965 with eight filter beds and a high lift pumping station. Administration and a research laboratory were completed in 1979. The city subsequently constructed the Bearspaw Treatment plant in 1972 on the Bow River to supplement the city&#x27;s water supply.

===2005 flood===
Although the dam usually provides effective flood protection, a major flood in June 2005 caused the reservoir to exceed its capacity. The excess spilled over the dam and into the river. The flow downstream increased from its normal average of 20-30 cubic metres per second up to 350 cubic metres per second. As a result, some roads were closed and 2,000 Calgarians who lived downstream were evacuated. The Glenmore water treatment plant had difficulty treating the heavily silted water, which caused the municipal government to issue water restrictions. Environment Canada noted the 2005 Alberta floods were a 200-year flood occurrence.

===2013 flood===
In June 2013, heavy rainfall west of the city caused the reservoir to exceed its capacity. As it did in 2005, excess water spilled over the dam and into the Elbow River, with downstream flows up to 544 cubic metres per second. 75,000 people from 26 neighbourhoods in the vicinity of the Bow and Elbow rivers were placed under a mandatory evacuation order as the rivers spilled over their banks and flooded neighbourhoods. City officials urged Calgarians, particularly the 350,000 people who worked downtown, to stay home and limit non-essential travel. Unlike the 2005 flood, the Glenmore water treatment facility had no difficulty treating water. City officials did, however, implement municipal outdoor watering restrictions to ensure water quality remained high throughout the incident. Government officials called the flooding the worst in Alberta&#x27;s history. After the flood, studies commissioned by the city and province investigated the construction of a $457 million tunnel to divert water from future flooding.

===2018-2020 Upgrades===

In 2018, a three-year project began to upgrade the ageing Glenmore Dam, increasing its capacity and improving its flood resistance. The dam itself was rehabilitated; 2.5m steel gates were added to the top of the dam which increased capacity by roughly 10 billion litres; and the bridge deck atop the dam was replaced in order to create more space for pathway users. This $81 million project also involved drawing down the reservoir during 2018 to the point that only hand launched boats were able to use the reservoir for sailing, and Heritage Park&#x27;s S.S. Moyie paddlewheeler was forced to remain in drydock. 
==Features==
The Glenmore Dam is a gravity dam which uses the downward force (weight) of the structure to resist the horizontal pressure of the water within the dam. These massive dams resist the thrust of water entirely by their own weight.

The Glenmore Water Treatment Plant, constructed in three phases in 1933, 1957 and 1965, is a conventional treatment plant that gets its water from the Elbow River. The Glenmore plant supplies drinking water to south Calgary.

===Flood control===
The reservoir is maintained at a level that, depending on the flow rate of the Elbow River, minimizes the risk of flooding around the reservoir and downstream of the dam to the greatest degree possible. During periods when the rate flow of the Elbow River reaches dangerous levels, water may be released from the dam to prevent overflow.

==Recreation==
The City of Calgary offers sailing lessons and boat rentals on the reservoir. The reservoir is home of the Glenmore Sailing Club , the Calgary Rowing Club and the Calgary Canoe Club for both social and organized sporting events in Calgary. From May 1 to October 31 the reservoir is open for fishing, sailing, rowing and canoeing. Swimming in the reservoir is not permitted.
There are popular pathways and bikeways looping around the perimeter of Glenmore Reservoir that are open all year.

==Bylaws==
The Glenmore Reservoir and Dam were constructed to provide Calgarians a safe and sufficient supply of drinking water with bylaws put in place to maintain the quality of the water. Under the Water Utility Bylaw, no person shall:
* enter or remain in or upon the water or the ice of the Glenmore Reservoir;
* place any object or thing in the water or upon the ice of the Glenmore Reservoir or any stream flowing into the Glenmore Reservoir;
* do anything or place or throw anything which may pollute or contaminate the water of the Glenmore Reservoir;
* allow any drain to be connected to any structure or device which drains into the Glenmore Reservoir.

===Dogs on the reservoir===
Under Calgary&#x27;s Responsible Pet Ownership Bylaw, the owner of any animal must ensure that their animal does not enter or remain in the water or upon the ice of the Glenmore Reservoir at any time.

===Related bylaws===
Glenmore Reservoir regulations are found in section 23 of the Water Utility Bylaw and in section 16 of the Responsible Pet Ownership Bylaw .

<text>Softimage, Co. () was a Canadian 3D animation software company located in Montreal, Quebec. A subsidiary of Microsoft in the 1990s, it was sold to Avid Technology, who would eventually sell the name and assets of Softimage&#x27;s 3D-animation business to Autodesk.

Its first product, Softimage 3D, was used in the creation of special effects for movies such as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. Its successor, Softimage XSI, was used in the production of the Academy Award-winning feature film &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, &quot;300&quot; and &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (2006) and the production of games such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;.

In 1997, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Softimage a Scientific and Engineering Award for the development of the &quot;Actor&quot; component of Softimage|3D.

During the Microsoft years, Softimage also developed a non-linear video-editing and compositing suite named Softimage|DS, which was available from Avid Technology under the name Avid DS, until its EOL on September 30, 2013.

== History ==
Softimage was founded in 1986 by National Film Board of Canada filmmaker Daniel Langlois. He was joined in 1988 by founding director, Char Davies, a Virtual Reality artist who became vice-president of Virtual Research. At the time, there were only three employees. Its first product was called the Softimage Creative Environment, later renamed to Softimage 3D. It was the first commercial package to feature Inverse kinematics for character animation. The software was eventually replaced by SoftimageXSI, originally codenamed &quot;Sumatra&quot;.

In 1991, Director of sales Richard Szalwinski left to found Discreet and re-distribute Animal Logic&#x27;s image compositor Eddie. Eddie would be acquired by Softimage from Discreet in 1992 and renamed Softimage|Eddie.

The company went public in 1992 and was acquired by Microsoft in 1994 for .

Dominique Boisvert, Réjean Gagné, Daniel Langlois, and Richard Laperrière won a Scientific and Engineering Award for the development of the &#x27;Actor&#x27; component of the Softimage computer animation system

In 1998, after helping to port the products to Windows and financing the development of Softimage|XSI and Softimage|DS, Microsoft sold the Softimage unit to Avid Technology, Inc. which was looking to expand its visual effect capabilities.

Avid initially grouped many of its visual effects products, such as Elastic Reality and Avid Media Illusion, under the Softimage brand, but in 2001 discontinued most of these products. Until 2008, Avid&#x27;s AlienBrain product was also branded with the name Softimage, even though it was developed by a separate company. During this time, in 2000, Softimage acquired The Motion Factory, Inc.

On October 23, 2008, Autodesk signed an agreement with Avid Technology to acquire the brand and the 3D animation assets of Softimage for approximately $35 million, thereby ending Softimage Co. as a distinct entity. The video-related assets of Softimage, including Softimage|DS (now Avid|DS) continue to be owned by Avid.

Softimage products were made in Quebec. Softimage is mentioned in the song &quot;Fabriqué au Québec&quot; written by the Québécois humorists Pat Groulx and Louis-José Houde.

== Products ==

=== Softimage|3D ===


Originally named Softimage Creative Environment, this was the first product developed by Softimage. Softimage President Daniel Langlois and engineers Richard Mercille and Laurent Lauzon begin development of the company&#x27;s 3-D application software in 1987. The user interface would remain largely unchanged for the next 16 years of the product&#x27;s life. In a first for the industry, the software offered modeling, animation and rendering in a single integrated environment.

Creative Environment 1.0 was introduced at SIGGRAPH in 1988 and the first public release, v0.8, was followed shortly by v1.0 all in 1988. The next year v1.65 was released including texture mapping followed in 1990 by v2.0 with a set of new animation tools, the concept of object constraints, a new Dopesheet editor, and spline modeling.

The software received a major update in 1991 with the release of v2.5 which included an Actor Module with Inverse Kinematics, a concept coming from robotics. The Actor Module also included Bones, Flexible Skin (Envelopes), and Rigid-Articulated Body Dynamics. Softimage received a Technological and Scientific Academy Award for the module&#x27;s innovation after it was employed in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (which itself won the Academy Award for Best Visual FX).

Additional updates followed in 1992 with v2.52 which included the addition of Motion Capture (Channels) and an SDK (DKit) and in 1993 with v2.6 which introduced a wide variety of features including Metaclay (&quot;Metaballs&quot;), Motion Control, Clusters, Shape Animation, mental ray rendering, Wave Deforms, Flock Animation (macro particles), a Standalone Particle System, Rotoscopy, 3D Booleans and Ghost display/Onion skinning. Mental ray rendering was made possible by a rendering technology agreement between Softimage and mental images announced the same year.

Along with Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Softimage in 1994, the company released v2.65 which introduced revamped File and Database Management, a new Topological scene graph update, Structure Keys, Extended Constraints, Expressions, Animation par Shapes, and Toon rendering.

The Interactive Developer&#x27;s Entertainment Authoring Software (IDEAS) with ProPlay and ProPlay Plus solutions was introduced in 1994 and included Softimage Creative Environment, Eddie compositing, video-effects software, distributed ray tracer and a 3-D particles kit.

The 1995 release of v3.0 was the first major release in which the product was named Softimage|3D and the same year, the company released the first version of its Softimage|3D Extreme edition which included Osmose, Virtual Theater (real time capture and virtual set compositing) and mental ray. Version 3.0 included NURBS Surfaces and Modeling (Trims, Instances and Relational modeling), Qstretch deform (squash and stretch), Custom hotkey remapping (swift keys), a Spreadsheet function, the 1st generation of Polygon Reduction, as well as Games Features (Advanced polygonal modeling tools, 2D/3D Paint + UV Texturing + Painterly Effects, Color Reduction, and Game Export / filtering / on target viewing for SEGA Saturn).

Version 3.5 was released in 1996 and included Windows NT support, User Data, an Image Library, Ambulate, Stepmaler, and the Saaphire SDK. It was followed in 1997 by v3.7 which expanded the Game Export functionality to include Sony PlayStation Export / Import / Viewer + Attribute Editors and also added Colors at Vertices (painting, OpenGL, Softimage + mr rendering, Saaphire), Direct3D Export / Import, and RenderMap (baking light maps).

In 1998, v3.8 brought a GDK (Game Development Kit / high-level AP), dotXSI file format, import/export pipeline (Direct 3D, VRML, 3D Studio) and the GameFilter, Merge, Polygon Reduction, Neural Quantizer (color reduction), Animation Sequencer (precursor to animation mixing), and Audio Track for lip synch features. This was followed a year later by v3.8 Service Pack 2 which included Advanced Rendering (Caustics support, Global Illumination), Bézier curves support, Surface Continuity Manager (SCM), Drop &amp; Slide Points, and GoWithThe Flow (which constrains objects to particles) plus additional games toolkits: Nintendo NIFF toolkit and Sony PlayStation HMD. Softimage|3D v3.9 was released in 2000 and v4.0 was unveiled in 2001 at SIGGRAPH and released in 2002.

=== Softimage|DS ===

In 1993, Softimage began developing what was initially known as Softimage Digital Studio on the Silicon Graphics IRIX (SGI) operating system. Digital Studio was a hardware/software integrated solution which was sold as a turn-key system including pre-installed software and a hardware workstation. The first Windows NT prototype of the product, under the new name Softimage|DS, was released in 1996 followed in 1997 by its 1.0 release on the Intergraph TDZ workstation and in 1998 with v2.1.

Following Autodesk&#x27;s 2008 purchase of all of the Softimage 3D business assets and the Softimage brand from Avid, Softimage|DS was rebranded Avid|DS. Avid continued to sell the solution until 2013.

=== Softimage|XSI ===

The software which would become Softimage|XSI was unveiled in 1996 under the code name Sumatra along with RenderFarm, a Sumatra module which was never released. In 1997, a company announcement mentioned Twister, a rendering module of Sumatra. Twister was officially announced at SIGGRAPH in 1998 as the first module of the still-unreleased Sumatra. However, Twister was later canceled to allow the company to focus on Sumatra.

The 1999 campaign &quot;Animation R3defined&quot; was the presentation of Sumatra as the first &quot;Non-Linear 3D animation&quot; system The Animation Mixer, which allows manipulation of animation as clips on tracks, similar to video non-linear editing system like Avid Media Composer.

Softimage|XSI finally had its v1.0 release in 2000 and included new generation architecture, user interface, workflow, etc. as well as ActiveScripting, Interactive Rendering (Render Region), Rendering Passes, Render Tree, GAP (Generic Attribute Painting), Surface meshes (Nurbs networks), Non-linear animation – Animation Mixer, and Integrated Particles features. The 1.0 release was followed later the same year with v1.5 which added Polygonal modeling, Subdivision Surfaces, and texturing tools as well as Animation Clip Effects/Offsets, Equalizer, Bridge Transitions, Scripted Operators (scripted plugins), Soft-Bodies, Cloth, Fluids (from Phoenix Tools), and the SDK Object Model (COM). While v1.5 was released in 2000, it didn&#x27;t start shipping until 2001. In the same year at SIGGRAPH the company announced Softimage|XSI v2.0 which introduced a fully integrated compositor, based on Avid Media Illusion, and a Hair and Fur module, based on Joe Alter&#x27;s Shave. Version 2.0 which was released later that year also brought with it support for Linux (previously, supported unix was SGI IRIX) and Electric Rain collaborate to bring Flash, EPS, AI and SVG exports to SOFTIMAGE|XSI customers.

The company released the SOFTIMAGE|XSI Experience for v2.0 in 2002. This was a free educational software and training kit. Alias had previously released a Personal Learning Edition of Maya, a Softimage competitor. Also in 2002, Softimage released Softimage|XSI v3.0 which was an evolutionary update but introduced Softimage|Behavior, a procedural animation system, marketed as a new Crowd Simulation engine. This was a re-branded version of a product called Motivate developed by Softimage&#x27;s 2000 acquisition, The Motion Factory.

Softimage released version 3.5 of Softimage|XSI in 2003 which updated Softimage|Behavior to version 1.1 and also brought back the Schematic View from Softimage|3D.

In 2004, v4.0 was released which included new Rigid Body Dynamics based on ODE, Character SDK, Custom Display Host, XML-based UI definition, new XGS real time shader pipeline, a new Vector and Raster Paint tool in the compositing module and shipped with Syflex. Version 4.2 was released later that same year. Version 5.0, released in 2005, was the first Windows 64-bit version and added new user interface elements to appeal to Autodesk Maya users as well as Integrated Cloth with Syflex 3, Updated Rigid Body Dynamics with physX, a new view: Shape Manager, for morph shape animation, and dotXSI 5.0.

There were two releases of Softimage|XSI in 2006: v5.1 which added Autodesk 3DS Max compatible keymap and GATOR plug-in for 3DS Max plus Collada import/export, and v6.0 with a focus on animation tools, animation layers, and a motion transfer tool (&quot;MOTOR&quot;), several new views including Material Manager, Material Panel and Animation Layer Manager as well as the Elastic Reality morpher in the compositor and Delta Referencing. These releases were followed in 2007 with v6.5 which was mostly a release to adjust price and re-shuffle features between the software&#x27;s two editions: XSI Essential and XSI Advanced.

The final release under Avid ownership and the final release using the product name Softimage|XSI was v7.0 which introduced ICE (&quot;Interactive Creative Environment&quot;). Later in the year, Autodesk acquired all Softimage 3D business assets from Avid and Softimage ceased to exist as an entity.

Autodesk Media and Entertainment continued to develop the Softimage|XSI product, re-branded as Autodesk Softimage.

=== Softimage|FaceRobot ===
Softimage|FaceRobot was introduced in 2006. Following Autodesk&#x27;s acquisition of all Softimage 3D business assets from Avid in 2008, FaceRobot was rebranded Autodesk FaceRobot.

=== Packages and libraries ===

==== Softimage|Eddie ====

Eddie was a paint and compositing package co-developed and co-owned by Discreet and Animal Logic. It was acquired by Softimage in 1992 and renamed Softimage|Eddie. In 1994, Softimage|Eddie was included in Softimage&#x27;s IDEAS bundle along with Softimage|3D and a number of related packages and tools. Version 3.2 was released in 1995.

==== Other packages and libraries ====

* SI Live Virtual Theater was first released at NAB in 1995
* Painterly Effects was an image processing library acquired by Softimage in 1992 from ImageWare Research
* Softimage Toonz, originally named Creative Toonz was a 2-D animation package which automated the more tedious tasks involved in 2-D cel animation, such as inking-&amp;-painting, while still maintaining the look of hand-drawn images and characters. The package was introduced by Softimage in 1993 and v3.5 was released in 1995.

<doc id="951414" wikidata="Q1658920" url="?curid=951414" title="Illusion of Gaia">
<text>Illusion of Gaia, known in PAL territories as Illusion of Time, is an action role-playing video game developed by Quintet for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released in Japan by Enix in 1993, and in North America and PAL territories by Nintendo in 1994 and 1995. Set in a fantasy reimagining of Earth, the game&#x27;s plot centers on a boy named Will who is chosen to save the world from an impending disaster. Throughout the game, the player guides Will through levels inspired by the ancient ruins of real-world civilizations and Wonders of the World, including the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China.

==Gameplay==
While &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; features a large cast of characters, Will, Freedan, and Shadow are the only playable characters in the game. Each possesses unique abilities, and certain areas are inaccessible without a specific character. The characters acquire new techniques as part of the story progression. Will&#x27;s techniques primarily focus on accessing new areas with incidental combat applications, while Freedan&#x27;s techniques are more combat-oriented. Shadow joins the party later in the game.

Combat is relatively straightforward. Characters share the same health and defense scores but have varying levels of strength. Freedan inflicts more damage than Will and has a longer reach, while Shadow deals more damage than Freedan. Attacks are primarily melee-based, utilizing Will&#x27;s flute, Freedan&#x27;s sword, or Shadow&#x27;s pseudopod. Enemies&#x27; health bars are displayed upon attacking, appearing as a series of red spheres that represent hit points. Bosses cannot be revisited, and enemies reappear only when Will loses all his lives or exits an area and returns.

&quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; does not employ experience points; instead, when the player defeats all enemies in a room, Will receives a jewel that grants a permanent increase in attack, defense, or health power. Although returning to a previously cleared area will cause enemies to reappear, the bonuses for defeating them again do not apply. When an enemy is defeated, it may drop a gold sphere worth a certain number of life points. If Will dies with 100 or more points, the player resumes play at the start of the current stage instead of losing outright.

&quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; lacks a currency or equipment system. There is only one healing item (herbs), which are scarce. Unlike most games of its type, previously visited areas cannot be revisited, except in the last third of the game. The only side quest, collecting all the Red Jewels, cannot be completed if the player fails to find some before advancing the story.

&quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; features a fixed difficulty setting. Saving occurs at Dark Spaces, which can be found in both combat and non-combat areas. Will can recover lost health within the Dark Spaces and may occasionally switch forms or gain abilities.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; is set in a version of Earth that is partially historical but primarily fantasy-based. The game features several real-world locations, such as Incan ruins, the Nazca Lines, Angkor Wat, the Great Wall of China, and the Egyptian pyramids. Each of these ruins holds a piece of the final puzzle, which is revealed in the legendary Tower of Babel.

The story takes place during the Age of Exploration, roughly corresponding to the 16th century, with references to figures like Christopher Columbus. Explorers seek ancient ruins, along with their treasures and secrets. Many return empty-handed, and some are never seen again. Will, the protagonist of the game, is the sole survivor of one such expedition. He accompanied his father, a renowned explorer, on a maritime journey to uncover the secrets of the Tower of Babel. The expedition encountered a mysterious disaster, and although Will managed to return to his hometown, he has no recollection of how he survived.

===Story===
When the game begins, Will stumbles into a &quot;Dark Space&quot;, where he encounters a being named Gaia, who possesses a human face and a tentacled body. Gaia informs Will that he must leave his home to save the world from an impending evil. A comet is approaching, bringing ill fortune to the world. As he journeys onward, Will gains the ability to transform into two additional forms, each with unique powers: Freedan, a dark knight, and Shadow, a solid manifestation of energy.

Later, the comet is revealed to be an ancient weapon from the last Blazer War, possessing the power to reshape the world. In the ruins of Angkor Wat, Will discovers that the comet&#x27;s previous approaches have disrupted the evolution of the world.

Will and his companions travel the globe to collect artifacts known as Mystic Statues. At the climax, Will and Kara reach the Tower of Babel, where Will is revealed to be the Dark Knight and Kara the Light Knight. The two knights unite to form Shadow and utilize the ancient statues to unleash the ultimate power, the firebird.

As the comet arrives, it manifests as Dark Gaia. Will and Kara succeed in destroying its power, restoring the world to normalcy. The spirits of Will&#x27;s parents inform Will and Kara that the world will return to its natural state and that neither of them will retain any memories of their adventure. Saddened by this realization, Will and Kara unite one last time to form Shadow and return to Earth.

The final scene is ambiguous. Will&#x27;s friends are depicted in what appears to be a modern-day school, suggesting that even if they have forgotten their time together, they remain friends in the &quot;real&quot; world.

==Development and release==
&quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; was scored by Yasuhiro Kawasaki. Moto Hagio is credited with the character designs, while novelist Mariko Ōhara contributed to the story. 

The game is often regarded as part of an unofficial trilogy alongside two other Quintet titles, &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; (1992) and &quot;Terranigma&quot; (1995). On the other hand, according to the producer of Enix USA, &quot;there is no connection in the universe between SoulBlazer and Gaia. SoulBlazer is actually related to ActRaiser&quot;. Therefore, the &quot;Gaia trilogy&quot; actually includes &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot;, &quot;Terranigma&quot;, and &quot;The Granstream Saga&quot;.

The game was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, debuting in Japan on November 27, 1993, and in North America on September 26, 1994. Developed by Quintet, the game was published in Japan by Enix and worldwide by Nintendo.

=== Prototype ===
A pre-release English-language version of &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; was leaked onto the internet as a ROM file. This pre-release version differed in presentation and translation from the final English-language version. For example, the prototype featured a different title screen based on the original Japanese title screen, showcasing small sprites of the game&#x27;s main characters running across the surface of a comet. The final version released in the United States included an instruction booklet with an image of an early title screen, which also displayed the small sprites at the bottom, albeit with the correct title. In the leaked prototype, the title was presented as &quot;SoulBlazer: Illusion of GAIA&quot;.

Another notable difference was that many of the original Japanese names appeared in the English-language pre-release version. For instance, the character &quot;Will&quot; was referred to as &quot;Tim&quot;, and &quot;Kara&quot; was named &quot;Karen&quot; (one instance of this name remained in the final release).

Some of the script in the English-language prototype varied from the final version, with one example being the character &quot;Jeweler Gem&quot;, who was portrayed as more &quot;sinister&quot;.

Finally, Nintendo was not credited in the pre-release version&#x27;s title screen. It is believed that the prototype was developed before Nintendo of America decided to publish and market the game in the United States. Once Nintendo agreed to serve as the U.S. publisher, the title was changed, and a logo was specifically redesigned to resemble the branding of Nintendo&#x27;s popular &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; franchise.

==Version differences==
In accordance with Nintendo of America&#x27;s censorship policies at the time of publication, several changes were made to the game to mitigate certain darker story elements. Most notably, the native tribe encountered near Angkor Wat was originally depicted as cannibals, with skeletal remains scattered around the village representing the remnants of their own tribesmen whom they had consumed to survive.

Religious references were modified or removed entirely. Will&#x27;s school was initially overseen by a priest and held within a Christian church. The American release merely identifies the building as a school and replaces the cross with a statue. In the Japanese version, speaking with the priest prompts Will to recite a prayer. In contrast, the American version has the teacher leading Will in reciting a poem. A translation error in a sequence near the middle of the game suggests that Seth&#x27;s consciousness has been absorbed into a sea monster named &quot;Riverson&quot;. The Japanese version states that he has been transformed into a &quot;Leviathan&quot;. Additionally, a line from the game&#x27;s climax, where Will and Kara remark, upon seeing Earth from outer space, that this must be what it feels like to be God, was also removed.

A significant gameplay alteration is that the Japanese and American releases feature different bosses in the Sky Garden. In the Japanese version, the boss is depicted as a giant bird, while in the American release, it is a winged Babylonian statue with talons. It is suggested that the American boss aligns more closely with the creators&#x27; initial vision and relates to the idea that the Sky Garden was once the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The developers took the opportunity presented by the port to &quot;tidy up&quot; the boss, as they were dissatisfied with the bird-snake hybrid used in the original release.

In Europe, the game was released as &quot;Illusion of Time&quot; in English, German, French, and Spanish. Of these, only the French version underwent significant changes, incorporating references to existing people or myths, such as Edgar Degas, Franz Kafka, Chrysaor, and Nosferatu.

===Merchandise===
Nintendo released a bundle pack in the United States that, while supplies lasted, included a &quot;one size fits all&quot; T-shirt featuring the game&#x27;s logo alongside characters Freedan and Shadow. As a Nintendo-published title in the U.S., the game received special attention in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine, and additional merchandise was available for purchase in the &quot;Super Power Supplies&quot; catalog for subscribers.

==Reception==
Quintet reported that &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; sold 650,000 cartridges sold worldwide, including 200,000 copies in Japan, 300,000 copies in North America, and 150,000 copies in Europe. In comparison, &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; had sold 295,000 cartridges worldwide.

&quot;GamePro&quot; praised the game&#x27;s puzzle-solving elements, effect-heavy graphics, eclectic soundtrack and gentle difficulty slope. They added that &quot;the game, however, has sacrificed the central theme that gave the original &quot;Soulblazer&quot; (and &quot;ActRaiser&quot; before it) a distinct sense of direction and purpose—an impression that your good works have an ongoing impact on the game world. On the other hand, &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; enjoys a sense of worldliness that &quot;Soulblazer&quot; didn&#x27;t have. ... you never know quite what&#x27;s coming next, and that&#x27;s the best thing that could be said about an RPG&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; was rated the 186th best game made on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 Games list in 2006. In 2018, Complex ranked &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; 86th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 1995, Total! rated the game 41st in their Top 100 SNES Games, complimenting the graphics and gameplay. IGN ranked &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; 74th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="951421" wikidata="Q1615303" url="?curid=951421" title="Rob Borbidge">
<text>Robert Edward Borbidge (born 12 August 1954) is a former Australian politician who served as the 35th Premier of Queensland from 1996 to 1998. He was the leader of the Queensland branch of the National Party, and was the last member of that party to serve as premier. His term as premier was contemporaneous with the rise of the One Nation Party of Pauline Hanson, which would see him lose office within two years.

== Early life ==
Borbidge was born in the town of Ararat, Victoria in 1954. His parents owned a sheep property and were attracted to Queensland by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s abolition of death duties, moving to the Gold Coast. He worked in his family motel business. At this time, the Gold Coast was the home of the property development boom that the Bjelke-Petersen government actively fostered, working in close co-operation with a group of developers known as the &quot;white-shoe brigade&quot;.

== Parliamentary and ministerial career ==
In an attempt to broaden its electoral base and reduce the influence of its coalition partner, the Liberal Party, the Country Party renamed itself as the National Party in 1974. Also in the mid-1970s, it began a concerted effort to retake seats in the Gold Coast. The area had been a National stronghold until the 1960s, but growing urbanization resulted in the Liberals taking most of the seats there. This was part of the Nationals&#x27; broader strategy of contesting seats in urbanised areas outside of its rural heartland. As a sign of this, in 1980 Borbidge contested and won the seat of Surfers Paradise from sitting Liberal member Bruce Bishop, who had alleged corruption in property development by the Bjelke-Petersen government.

By the late 1980s, the scandal of the extreme corruption revealed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry had engulfed Bjelke-Petersen, who was replaced as Premier and National Party leader in 1987 by Mike Ahern. Borbidge, as a member of the new generation of Nationals untouched by political scandal, was promoted by Ahern to Cabinet as Minister for Small Business, Communications and Technology. He received the important portfolio of Tourism in 1989 and was briefly made Minister for Police, Emergency Services and Tourism by Ahern&#x27;s successor Russell Cooper before he lost office at the hands of the Labor Party&#x27;s Wayne Goss in the 1989 election.

== National Party leadership ==
In the post-election party room ballot, Borbidge was elected deputy leader of the party, and hence Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was also made Shadow Minister for Small Business, Manufacturing and Regional Development.

The shell-shocked Nationals worked at rebuilding the Coalition with the Liberals, which had been torn apart seven years earlier, and adjusting to opposition after 32 years in office. In December 1991 an inquiry by the Criminal Justice Commission was announced to investigate irregularities in the travel allowances of members of Parliament. Cooper announced that he was one of the individuals under investigation and resigned as National Party leader in favour of Borbidge.

In the lead-up to the 1992 election Borbidge attempted to make overtures to the Liberals about reforming the coalition, but was rebuffed by the Liberals, who were aiming to finally achieve long-awaited senior coalition party status in Queensland after having been the junior partner since 1925. This did not eventuate; Goss remained in office, and the chastened parties discussed merging before agreeing to sign a new coalition agreement.

Borbidge and Liberal leader Joan Sheldon initially failed to make much headway against the Goss government, with some disgruntled Nationals comparing Borbidge unfavourably to Bjelke-Petersen. In response to speculation about the leadership, Borbidge called a spill for the leadership in June 1994. He was re-elected unopposed.

The Goss government&#x27;s fortunes suffered a sharp reversal when it announced plans to construct a bypass through areas of bushland that comprised significant reserves of koala habitats. Borbidge harnessed the ground swell of opposition arising from this and other controversial decisions to encourage a large protest vote. Combined with the cynical mood engendered by the unpopular Keating Labor federal government, this protest vote nearly destroyed the Goss government&#x27;s majority in the July 1995 election. While the Coalition won the popular vote, most of that vote was wasted on large margins in the Nationals&#x27; heartland. As a result, while it managed an eight-seat swing, it won only nine seats (out of 40) in Brisbane, allowing Goss to rely on a majority of one vote in the Legislative Assembly. The Court of Disputed Returns ordered a reballot after alleged irregularities in the narrowly Labor held electorate of Mundingburra, which the Coalition had lost by only 12 votes. In February 1996 the Liberal candidate, Frank Tanti, won the subsequent by-election. This resulted in a hung parliament with 44 Coalition seats and 44 Labor seats with one Independent, Liz Cunningham, the newly elected member for Gladstone. Cunningham announced that she would support the Coalition, and Borbidge became Premier.

== Premiership ==
Borbidge&#x27;s government imitated that of Goss when it initiated sweeping changes in the public service when it won office. In some cases, figures who had been demoted or dismissed when Goss had come to power were reinstated to their former positions. Borbidge was criticised for attempting to stack the public service, but he counter-alleged that the public service was already subject to severe Labor bias.

The Borbidge government also initiated changes to the industrial relations system by introducing Queensland Workplace Agreements (QWA&#x27;s), similar to the Australian Workplace Agreements later created under the Federal Liberal government of John Howard. Borbidge also supported Howard in his efforts to reform Australian gun ownership laws after the Port Arthur massacre, a move that brought him unpopularity in some traditional National Party quarters. When in 1997 the High Court of Australia expanded the recently introduced concept of Native title in bringing down the Wik decision (for which Borbidge criticised the bench as &quot;historical dills&quot;), Borbidge argued that Howard&#x27;s proposed changes to the Native Title Act did not go far enough in abolishing native title from pastoral leases. However, the Act was supported by the National party federally.

The Borbidge government was almost immediately beset by scandal when it was revealed that, during the Mundingburra by-election campaign, Borbidge and Cooper (now Minister for Police) had signed a secret Memorandum of Understanding with the Queensland Police Union guaranteeing the QPU the repeal of unpopular Goss government measures, the power of veto over senior police appointments, and increased police funding, in return for a donation of $20,000 to the by-election campaign. This close relationship evoked many memories of the Bjelke-Petersen era, where relations between the executive and the police service were frequently close.

The matter was referred to the Criminal Justice Commission (CJC), a body that had been established on the recommendation of the Fitzgerald Inquiry and one that was regarded poorly both by the National Party and the Queensland Police. Retired New South Wales Supreme Court judge Kenneth Carruthers was appointed to lead the inquiry, which also investigated an allegedly improper agreement between the Labor Party and the Sporting Shooters&#x27; Association.

The government became embroiled in a war of words with the CJC, and Sheldon&#x27;s first budget as Treasurer reduced funding for the body. In October 1996 the government announced an inquiry into the CJC itself. This had a dramatic sequel when after the new inquiry, led by retired Queensland Supreme Court judges Peter Connolly and Kevin Ryan, requested that Carruthers hand over all records from his inquiry, he resigned without completing his inquiry, alleging interference. The Carruthers Inquiry was completed by Bob Gotterson and Brendan Butler, who ultimately exonerated all the participants from facing potential criminal charges.

In June 1997 Carruthers and the CJC went to the Supreme Court of Queensland, applying for an end to the Connolly-Ryan inquiry. The Court closed the inquiry in August, stating that it had acted outside of its terms of reference and Connolly was compromised by bias. A subsequent motion of no confidence was passed in the Parliament against Denver Beanland, Attorney-General, with Cunningham&#x27;s support, but Beanland, with Borbidge&#x27;s support, refused to resign.

In the lead-up to the 1998 election, intense speculation surrounded the role that the new One Nation Party, formed in April 1997 by Queensland federal MP Pauline Hanson, would play. Hanson&#x27;s positions on issues such as multiculturalism, gun ownership and native title were well received in the Nationals&#x27; heartland of rural and regional Queensland. Indeed, for much of 1997 and 1998, there was fear in National circles that One Nation could sweep the Nationals out of existence. The Nationals struggled to prevent leakage of their support to One Nation. The cynical mood in the electorate that Borbidge had harnessed to win office now began to turn against him, as he endeavoured to satisfy both the hard-line conservatives deserting the Nationals, and the urban Liberal supporters who detested Hanson and her views. Knowing the threat One Nation posed to his own party, Borbidge attempted to ensure that One Nation would be placed last on coalition how-to-vote cards. However, the organisational wings of both the Liberal and National parties rebuffed him and insisted that they would preference One Nation ahead of Labor (see Australian electoral system). This was done under pressure from the federal Liberal and National organisations, who apparently believed that One Nation&#x27;s populism would strike a chord with Labor voters and thus peel enough of them off to keep Labor out of power.

In the 1998 election, the Coalition was severely punished for this stance, experiencing a 17.7% primary vote swing against it from 1995 and suffering an 11-seat swing. One Nation picked up 11 seats, and unexpectedly finished second in the primary vote, ahead of the Liberals and Nationals. Indeed, One Nation&#x27;s showing was strong enough to render any attempt to calculate a two-party preferred vote meaningless. The Coalition was reduced to 32 seats to Labor&#x27;s 44. Indeed, Labor was only denied outright victory when leakage of Coalition preferences allowed One Nation to win seven seats that would have otherwise gone to Labor. Labor only needed the support of one of the two independents in the legislature—Cunningham and Peter Wellington—to make Peter Beattie premier, while Borbidge needed the support of both independents and the One Nation MPs to stay in power. However, this was brought undone when Wellington agreed to support a minority Labor government. Borbidge promptly resigned.

Borbidge made little headway as Opposition Leader against Beattie. The Coalition reaped no benefit when One Nation imploded, or when an inquiry ended the careers of several Labor MPs—including Deputy Premier Jim Elder. Before the 2001 state election, Borbidge, remembering what happened three years earlier, promised that the Coalition would never preference One Nation again. However, several of his own MPs reneged on that promise after the writs were dropped. Beattie seized on this, arguing that this proved a Coalition government would only survive with the support of One Nation and former One Nation MPs. At the 17 February election, the Coalition saw its seat count more than halved, to 17 seats. Notably, it lost all but one seat in Brisbane. Amid this severe defeat, Borbidge created controversy when he immediately resigned from parliament, forcing a by-election in Surfers Paradise. The Nationals felt the brunt of voter backlash at going back to the polls for the second time in three months; their primary vote collapsed to eight percent, resulting in the election of independent member Lex Bell in the traditionally safe National seat.

As National Party leader, Borbidge led his party either on its own or in coalition with the Liberals to four elections but did not win any of them and only became Premier in 1996 as the direct result of the Mundingburra by-election. He was premier for only two of his nine years as National Party leader.

==Post-premiership==
Borbidge was featured on the 23 April 2013 episode of &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; for his stance on gun control following the Port Arthur massacre.

In 2013 Borbidge became chairman of the aero-medical organisation Careflight (since July 2016 known as LifeFlight).

<doc id="951422" wikidata="Q145937" url="?curid=951422" title="Piano Sonata No. 3 (Beethoven)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 3 in C major, Op. 2, No. 3, was written in 1795 and dedicated to Joseph Haydn. It was published simultaneously with his first and second sonatas in 1796.

The sonata is often referred to as one of Beethoven&#x27;s earliest &quot;grand and virtuosic&quot; piano sonatas. All three of Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 2 piano sonatas contain four movements, an unusual length at the time, which seems to show that Beethoven was aspiring towards composing a symphony. It is both the weightiest and longest of the three Op. 2 sonatas, and it presents many difficulties for the performer, including difficult trills, awkward hand movements, and forearm rotation. It is also one of Beethoven&#x27;s longest piano sonatas in his early period. With an average performance lasting just about 24–26 minutes, it is second only to the Grand Sonata in E Major, Op. 7, also published in 1796.

==Structure==
The sonata, in C major, consists of four movements:

=== I. &quot;Allegro con brio&quot; ===

The first movement follows the sonata allegro format of the classical period, and borrows thematically from Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Quartet No. 3 in C major, WoO 36, from a decade earlier. The movement opens with the main theme in the tonic key, beginning with a double-thirds trill-like pattern. This opening passage is infamous for pianists to play, and Arthur Rubinstein even used this passage to test pianos before performing on them. This pattern leads into an energetic outburst of a broken-chord and broken-octave section. The second theme of the exposition begins in the key of G minor, and is repeated in D minor at measure 33. It is not until measure 47 that the traditional dominant key is finally reached, where a subsidiary theme in the second thematic group appears, marked &quot;dolce.&quot; A forte shows later, leading to a very rich melody with left and right hand. Then a similar outburst of a broken-chord and broken-octave sections appears in fortissimo. Then it ends with some difficult trills and an octave scale. Beethoven opens the development by improvising on trill patterns introduced in the end of the exposition, which are much more difficult to play. Following a broken-chords section filled with harmony changes, the main theme is restated in D major (pianissimo), the supertonic key of C major. Then a fortissimo and Beethoven&#x27;s very common syncopations appear in the music giving a rhythm, this continues on to the resolution. The first movement is about 10 minutes long and is one of Beethoven&#x27;s longest movements from his early period.

===II. &quot;Adagio&quot;===

&lt;/score&gt;

The second movement is marked &quot;Adagio&quot; and written in the key of E major. It is in rondo form, A–B–A–C–A–coda, written in the style of a string quartet, as there are four clear voices. The middle section, in E minor, contains numerous examples of Romanticism, and is considered a prelude to the master&#x27;s later sonatas. Later in the movement, the E minor passage is repeated in E major.

The third movement, a scherzo, is written in minuet and trio form. It opens with a joke-like statement, and the composer uses some polyphony. The trio is in the relative minor key of C major (A minor) and contains running arpeggios in the right hand with the left hand playing a melodic line in octave form. The coda of this short movement ends the Scherzo softly with a tritone substitute authentic cadence.

===IV. &quot;Allegro assai&quot;===

The final movement, listed as a rondo, is in the sonata rondo form. The movement opens with an ascending run of first inversion chords in the right hand, which is the movement&#x27;s main theme. Like the first movement, the second theme in the exposition is also written in G major. The great speed of this movement, combined with numerous examples of Beethoven&#x27;s virtuoso skill such as the triple trill at the very end, makes it challenging for pianists.
