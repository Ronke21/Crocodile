<text>Holywood ( ; ) is a town in the metropolitan area of Belfast in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is a civil parish and townland of lying on the shore of Belfast Lough, between Belfast and Bangor. Holywood Exchange and Belfast City Airport are nearby.

==Toponymy==
The English name &quot;Holywood&quot; comes . This was the name the Normans gave to the woodland surrounding the monastery of St Laiseran, son of Nasca. The monastery was founded by Laiseran before 640 and was on the site of the present Holywood Priory. The earliest Anglicised form appears as &quot;Haliwode&quot; in a 14th-century document.

The Irish name for Holywood is &quot;Ard Mhic Nasca&quot; meaning &quot;high ground of Mac Nasca&quot;.

==History==
In the early 19th century, Holywood, like many other coastal villages throughout Ireland, became popular as a resort for sea-bathing. Many wealthy Belfast merchants chose the town and the surrounding area to build large homes for themselves. These included the Kennedys of Cultra and the Harrisons of Holywood. Dalchoolin House stood on the site of the present Ulster Transport Museum, while Cultra Manor was built between 1902–04 and now houses the Ulster Folk Museum.

The railway line from Belfast to Holywood opened in 1848, and this led to rapid development. The population of Holywood was approximately 3,500 in 1900 and had grown to 12,000 by 2001. This growth, coupled with that of other towns and villages along the coastal strip to Bangor, necessitated the construction of the Holywood Bypass which was completed in 1972.
The Old Priory ruins lie at the bottom of the High Street. The tower dates from 1800, but the oldest ruins date from the early 13th century. The Priory graveyard is the resting place for many distinguished citizens including the educational reformer, Robert Sullivan, and the Praeger family. Sullivan Upper Grammar School is named after Robert Sullivan. Robert Lloyd Praeger (1865–1953) was an internationally renowned botanist and his sister, Rosamond Praeger (1867–1954), gained fame as a sculptor and writer.

On 17 June 1994, Garnet Bell, a former pupil bearing a grudge, entered an assembly hall at Sullivan Upper School and used a flamethrower to attack students taking A-level examinations. Six pupils were injured; three of them seriously.

On 12 April 2010, at around 12:24am, a car bombing occurred near Palace Barracks, a British Army barracks on the edge of Holywood&#x27;s town centre. An elderly man was blown off his feet and had to be treated in hospital. The bomb was allegedly driven towards the base in a hijacked taxi. The Real IRA claimed responsibility for the attack.
==Demography==
As of the 2011 United Kingdom census on 27 March, there were 11,257 people living in Holywood. Of these:
*18.29% were under 16 years of age and 18.79% were 65 or older
*48.99% were male and 51.01% were female
*62.25% were from a Protestant or other Christian background and 23.11% were from a Catholic Christian background.
*3.39% of people aged 16–74 were unemployed.

==Places of interest==

*Holywood is known for its maypole at the crossroads in the centre of town. Its origin is uncertain, but, according to local folklore, it dates from 1700, when a Dutch ship is said to have run aground on the shore nearby, and the crew erected the broken mast to show their appreciation of the assistance offered to them by the townsfolk. It was the only surviving original maypole in Ireland, but was severely damaged in high winds in February 2021 and had to be replaced.
* The nearby Maypole Bar is known locally as Ned&#x27;s. 
*There is a Norman motte in the town which may have been constructed on an earlier burial mound.
*The Ulster Folk and Transport Museum illustrating the way of life and traditions of the people of Ulster is nearby, at Cultra.

==Transport==
On 2 August 1848, the first leg of the Belfast and County Down Railway, or BCDR, was opened from Belfast to Holywood. The Holywood railway station opened simultaneously. The railway line was extended via the Belfast, Holywood and Bangor Railway (BHBR) to Bangor, and the extension opened on 1 May 1865. The BCDR acquired the BHBR in 1884. Holywood station was closed for goods traffic on 24 April 1950.

<text>Rivington Street is a street in the New York City borough of Manhattan, which runs across the Lower East Side neighborhood, between the Bowery and Pitt Street, with a break between Chrystie and Forsyth for Sara D. Roosevelt Park. Vehicular traffic runs west on this one-way street.

It is named after James Rivington, who under cover of writing one of the most infamous Loyalist newspapers in the American colonies, secretly ran a spy ring that supplied George Washington with information. Early in the 20th century, the street was the home of many Italian and Jewish immigrants, hence the birthplace of many second generation Italian and Jewish Americans. George Burns lived there for a time.

==Points of interest==

The site of the second African burial ground in New York lies between Rivington and Stanton Streets, now a playground in the Sara D. Roosevelt Park. The M&#x27;Finda Kalunga community garden is also at this location. Several functioning synagogues remain on Rivington Street, a reminder of the large Jewish immigrant population that once inhabited the Lower East Side.

The synagogue of the First Roumanian-American Congregation existed from about 1860 until 2006. The Rivington Street municipal bath was located on Rivington Street from 1900 to 1975.

In the early 1980s, Rivington Street between Essex and Bowery earned notoriety as a &quot;drug supermarket&quot; famous for &quot;having the best drugs in the city.&quot;

Rivington Street is a cross street to the Lower East Side&#x27;s main thoroughfares. It has, in recent years, become part of an area known as &quot;Hell Square&quot;; there is a high saturation of restaurants and bars along the street.

Notable establishments on Rivington Street include the University Settlement House (the first settlement house in New York), the Rivington Street Settlement house (established 1889), the art center and hardcore punk music venue ABC No Rio, and the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Center, and the newly constructed 21-story Hotel on Rivington.

==In popular culture==
Rivington Street was used for the cover to the Beastie Boys&#x27; album &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;. The intersection of Rivington and Ludlow Street, where the cover photo was taken, was renamed &quot;Beastie Boys Square&quot; on September 9, 2023.

The Rivington School art movement was named after an abandoned public school building located on Rivington Street.

In 1979, Genya Ravan wrote and recorded her autobiographical song &quot;202 Rivington Street&quot;, the address being where her family settled after their escape from the Holocaust in 1947. Like much of her work, including &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Pigeons&quot; from her 1978 album &quot;Urban Desire&quot;, the ballad contains numerous references to neighborhood landmarks, including Pitt Street Park. &quot;Laundry on strings hanging from iron bars with nowhere to escape&quot; - From &quot;202 Rivington Street&quot; by Genya Ravan (1979): &quot;Oh darlin, the New York City Jammed my Brain, all I get from this city is heat and my heaters don&#x27;t care&quot;.

D.W. Griffith&#x27;s 1910 film In the Ghetto begins in Rivington Street. There are authentic sequences of the Rivington Street markets in that film, corresponding with the photography of George Grantham Bain in the inset above. 

The novel &quot;Rivington Street&quot; by Meredith Tax tells the story of a Jewish immigrant family from Russia&#x27;s life on the Lower East Side in the early twentieth century.

In Moyshe Nadir&#x27;s 1932 Yiddish poem, &quot;Rivington Strit&quot; (Rivington Street), the poet meets an old Jewish peddler who extemporizes a poetic history of the area.

In the movie &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1957), the main characters live in an apartment at 967 Rivington (apartment 3H).

In the novel &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot;, the protagonist Sammy Glick turns out to have lived on Rivington Street at the beginning of his career, then named &quot;Samuel Glickstein&quot;, when he is hired as a copy boy by &quot;The New York Record&quot;. The street is described by the narrator as one of a conglomerate of &quot;jumbled ghetto streets&quot; into which millions of Jews are crowded.

Lady Gaga makes mention of The Rivington Rebels, a group of local area partiers, in her 2011 studio album &quot;Born This Way&quot;. The lyrics, from the track &quot;Heavy Metal Lover&quot;, are as follows, &quot;Dirty pearls and a patch for all The Rivington Rebels. Let&#x27;s raise hell in the streets, drink beer, and get into trouble.&quot;

In &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot;, Rivington Street is revealed to be the location of Jacob&#x27;s bakery.

<text>George &amp; James is an album released by American art rock group the Residents in 1984, subtitled &quot;American Composer Series – Volume 1&quot;. Side one of the album consists of George Gershwin covers, while side two is a studio rendition of James Brown&#x27;s 1963 album &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot;.

The American Composer Series was meant to be an ongoing project, lasting from 1984 until 2000, with the intent to pay homage to different composers and songwriters from the United States. After a second album, &quot;Stars and Hank Forever&quot; (released in 1986), the project was cancelled following unenthusiastic reviews and high licensing costs, as well as the advent of CD technology, hindering the concept of split albums. The group has mentioned abandoned plans to cover music by Harry Partch, Harry Nilsson, Barry White, Bob Dylan, Sun Ra and Ray Charles, among others.

<doc id="951434" wikidata="Q15521633" url="?curid=951434" title="Randy Weaver">
<text>Randall Claude Weaver (January 3, 1948 – May 11, 2022) was an American survivalist and self-proclaimed white separatist. He was a central actor in the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff with federal agents at his cabin near Naples, Idaho, during which his wife and son were killed. Weaver was charged with murder, conspiracy, and assault as well as other crimes. He was acquitted of most of the charges, but was convicted of failing to appear in court on a previous weapons charge and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He and his family eventually received a total of $3.1 million in compensation for the killing of his wife and son by federal agents.

==Early life==
Randy Weaver was born on January 3, 1948, to Clarence and Wilma Weaver, a farming couple in Villisca, Iowa. He was one of four children. The Weavers were deeply religious and had difficulty finding a denomination that matched their views; they often moved around among evangelical, Presbyterian, and Baptist churches.

After graduating from Jefferson High School in 1966, he attended Iowa Central Community College for two years. In 1968, he dropped out to enlist in the United States Army during the height of the Vietnam War. He was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. While Weaver had told other people that he had been a Green Beret in the Army, his discharge papers showed that he had never been a member of the Green Berets or Special Forces, but may have received some general demolitions training as a combat engineer.

In 1970, during a visit to his hometown while on leave, Weaver met his future wife Victoria &quot;Vicki&quot; Jordison. He introduced himself as &quot;Pete&quot;, rather than his &quot;hated&quot; given name Randall. He was discharged at the rank of sergeant on October 8, 1971, and married Vicki the following month.

== Ruby Ridge siege ==
=== Background ===
A month after leaving the Army, Randy Weaver and Vicki Jordison married in a ceremony at the First Congregationalist Church in Fort Dodge, Iowa, in November 1971. After a semester at the University of Northern Iowa, Randy dropped out after finding well-paying work at a local John Deere factory. Vicki worked first as a secretary and then as a homemaker.

Partially as a result of reading the 1978 book &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth,&quot; the couple began to harbor more Christian fundamentalist beliefs, with Vicki believing that the apocalypse was imminent. To follow Vicki&#x27;s vision of her family surviving the apocalypse away from what they saw as a corrupt civilization, the Weaver family moved to a property in remote Boundary County, Idaho, in 1983 and built a cabin there. They paid $5,000 in cash ($ in ) and traded their moving truck for the land, valued at $500 an acre.

In 1988, Weaver decided to run for county sheriff by using the slogan &quot;Get out of jail – free&quot; and he was adamant about his decision not to pay taxes.

While the Weavers subscribed to ideas that broadly fell under the category of Christian Identity, their beliefs were still different. Like many in that movement, Vicki Weaver developed a set of beliefs which were based on her adherence to Old Covenant Laws, and her family referred to God as Yahweh (see Sacred Name Movement). They also believed themselves to be Israelites.

In 1989, Weaver met Kenneth Fadeley at a meeting of the white supremacist group Aryan Nations. Fadeley was actually an undercover ATF agent investigating the Aryan Nation complex under the alias &quot;Gus Magisano&quot;. Weaver agreed to sell Fadeley two sawed-off shotguns, and was recorded on tape saying he could supply Fadelay with four or five illegal shotguns a week. In December 1990, Weaver received felony weapons charges in connection with the 1989 transaction. During the initial encounter with Fadeley, the Weaver family relocated from a rental house to a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in the Selkirk Mountains. After charges were pressed against her husband, Vicki Weaver wrote to U.S. Attorney Maurice O. Ellsworth, addressing him as &quot;Servant of the Queen of Babylon&quot; and writing, &quot;The stink of your lawless government has reached Heaven, the abode of Yahweh our Yashua&quot;, and &quot;Whether we live or whether we die, we will not bow to your evil commandments.&quot;

At the time of the Ruby Ridge siege, the Weavers had four children: Sara, 16; Samuel, 14; Rachel, 10; and Elisheba, 10 months. Vicki homeschooled the children.

=== Siege ===
Ruby Ridge was the site of an 11-day police standoff in 1992 in Boundary County, Idaho, near Naples. It began on August 21, when deputies of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) initiated action to apprehend and arrest Randy Weaver under a bench warrant after his failure to appear on firearms charges.

Weaver refused to surrender and remained at home with his family and friend Kevin Harris. The Hostage Rescue Team of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI HRT) became involved as the siege developed.

During the Marshals Service reconnoiter of the Weaver property, six Marshals encountered Harris, and Randy&#x27;s 14-year-old son, Sammy Weaver, in the woods near the family cabin. A shootout took place. Marshals shot the Weavers&#x27; dog Striker, then shot Sammy Weaver in the back as he ran away, killing him. During the firefight, Harris shot Deputy U.S. Marshal, William Francis Degan, in the chest, resulting in Degan&#x27;s death.

On August 22, 1992 FBI sniper/observers in the Hostage Rescue Team were dispatched to Ruby Ridge. The team used specified &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; which allowed them to shoot any armed adult male exiting the cabin.
In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence, led by the FBI, Weaver&#x27;s wife Vicki was shot and killed by an FBI sniper while standing in her home holding her 10-month-old daughter. Harris was critically wounded and almost died during the subsequent standoff. Weaver was shot once; he was not holding a weapon at the time. All casualties occurred in the first two days of the operation. The siege and standoff were ultimately resolved by civilian negotiator, Bo Gritz, who was instrumental in getting Weaver to allow Harris to get medical attention. Harris surrendered and was arrested on August 30. Weaver and his three daughters surrendered the next day after being convinced by Gritz that there was no other sensible solution.

=== Aftermath ===
Weaver was charged with multiple crimes relating to the Ruby Ridge incident — a total of ten counts, including the original firearms charges. Attorney, Gerry Spence, handled Weaver&#x27;s defense, and successfully argued that Weaver&#x27;s actions were justifiable as self-defense. Spence did not call any witnesses for the defense, rather focusing on attacking the credibility of FBI agents and forensic technicians. The judge dismissed two counts after hearing prosecution witness testimony. The jury acquitted Weaver of all remaining charges except two, one of which the judge set aside. He was found guilty of one count, failure to appear, for which he was fined $10,000, and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He was credited with time served plus an additional three months, and was then released. Kevin Harris was acquitted of all criminal charges.

In August 1995, the US government avoided trial on a civil lawsuit filed by the Weavers by awarding the three surviving daughters $1,000,000 each, and Randy Weaver $100,000 over the deaths of Sammy and Vicki Weaver.

==Later life==
Weaver testified about his racial beliefs before a U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee in 1995: &quot;I&#x27;m not a hateful racist as most people understand it. But I believe in the separation of races. We wanted to be separated from the rest of the world, to live in a remote area, to give our children a good place to grow up.&quot;

In 1995, Weaver was interviewed by &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Ken Fuson and expressed regret about not appearing in court for his 1991 gun charge: &quot;I&#x27;m not totally without fault in this.&quot;

In April 1996, Weaver accompanied Bo Gritz to Jordan, Montana, where Gritz was to attempt to negotiate a conclusion to the Montana Freemen standoff. However, Weaver was not allowed by the FBI to enter the Freemen&#x27;s holdout.

In 1998, Weaver published &quot;The Federal Siege at Ruby Ridge: In Our Own Words&quot;, which he partly sold in person at gun shows.

In 1999, Weaver married Linda Gross, a legal secretary, in Jefferson, Iowa.

On June 18, 2007, Weaver participated in a press conference with tax protesters Edward and Elaine Brown on the front porch of their home in Plainfield, New Hampshire. He declared, &quot;I ain&#x27;t afraid of dying no more. I&#x27;m curious about the afterlife, and I&#x27;m an atheist.&quot;

==Death==
Weaver&#x27;s daughter, Sara, posted online that he had died on May 11, 2022, after being sick since at least mid-April. A cause of death was not given. He was 74 years old.

==Appearance in media==
A CBS miniseries about the Ruby Ridge incident, titled &quot;Ruby Ridge: An American Tragedy&quot;, aired on May 19 and 21, 1996. It was based on the book &quot;Every Knee Shall Bow&quot; by reporter Jess Walter. It starred Laura Dern as Vicki, Kirsten Dunst as Sara, and Randy Quaid as Randy. Later that year, the television series was adapted into a full-length TV movie, &quot;The Siege at Ruby Ridge&quot;.

PBS&#x27; &quot;American Experience&quot; aired an episode titled &quot;Ruby Ridge&quot; on February 14, 2017.

<text>A floating island is a mass of floating aquatic plants, mud, and peat ranging in thickness from several centimeters to a few meters. Sometimes referred to as tussocks, floatons, or suds, floating islands are found in many parts of the world. They exist less commonly as an artificial island. Floating islands are generally found on marshlands, lakes, and similar wetland locations, and can be many hectares in size.

==Natural occurrences==

Natural floating islands are composed of vegetation growing on a buoyant mat of plant roots or other organic detritus.
In aquatic regions of Northwestern Europe, several hundred hectares or a couple thousand acres of floating meadows (German &quot;Schwingrasen&quot;, Dutch &quot;trilveen&quot;) have been preserved, which are partly used as agricultural land, partly as nature reserves.

They typically occur when growths of cattails, bulrush, sedge, and reeds extend outward from the shoreline of a wetland area. As the water gets deeper the roots no longer reach the bottom, so they use the oxygen in their root mass for buoyancy, and the surrounding vegetation for support to retain their top-side-up orientation. The area beneath these floating mats is exceptionally rich in aquatic lifeforms. Eventually, storm events tear whole sections free from the shore, and the islands thus formed migrate around a lake with changing winds, eventually either reattaching to a new area of the shore or breaking up in heavy weather.

Some cenotes in northern Mexico have natural floating islands.

In the Brazilian Amazon, floating islands form in lakes on the floodplains of white-water rivers and are known as Matupá and range in size from a few square meters to a few hectares.

In Crow Wing County, Minnesota a floating bog over in size moved about the area resulting in docks and boat lifts being destroyed. As decaying mass decomposes it releases gases which keep the bog floating.

===Pumice rafts===

Another type of natural floating island is the pumice raft, which is created by an explosive volcanic eruption, and can float on the ocean for months or even years before becoming fully saturated and sinking. They may assist in the migration of plants and animals.

== Artificial floating islands ==

Floating artificial islands are generally made of bundled reeds, and the best known examples are those of the Uros people of Lake Titicaca, Peru, who build their villages upon what are in effect huge rafts of bundled totora reeds. The Uros originally created their islands to prevent attacks by their more aggressive neighbours, the Incas and Collas.

The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, was surrounded with &quot;chinampas&quot;, small artificial islands used for agriculture known as &quot;floating gardens&quot; (though not really floating). Floating gardens on a large scale have been demonstrated with aquaponics systems in China growing rice, wheat and canna lily on islands.

Spiral Island was a more modern one-person effort to build an artificial floating island, on the Caribbean coast of Mexico. Modern artificial islands mimicking the floating reedbeds of the Uros are increasingly used by local governments and catchment managers to improve water quality at source, reducing pollutants in surface water bodies and providing biodiversity habitat. Examples include Gold Coast City Council in Australia. Artificial floating reedbeds are commonly anchored to the shoreline or bottom of water body, to ensure the system does not float away in a storm event or create a hazard.

During World War II, the British Project Habakkuk proposed the construction of aircraft carriers made of ice-like Pykrete. Its size and speed made it more of an artificial iceberg or island than a ship.

Commercial development of floating islands has begun taking place. Floating habitat islands were installed with salicornia salt marsh plants at Sydney Olympic Park Authority in 2011 providing nesting sites for local and migratory birds including black swans, black-winged stilts, red-necked avocets, Pacific black ducks and chestnut teals, using the Aqua Biofilter product. The world&#x27;s largest vegetated floating islands in size were installed in 2004 using Aqua Biofilter product with canna at Lake Tai, China using materials including a combination of polyurethane open cell filter foam, closed cell polyethylene flotation foam, bamboo and coconut fibre filter foam mix with wicking ability to supply water to plant roots.

A commercially produced floating island was installed in the river otter enclosure at Zoo Montana in 2007. In 2009 and the beginning of 2010, a few larger islands were launched to provide nesting habitat for Caspian tern colonies. The largest of the islands, at a record-setting , was launched into the water at Sheepy Lake. These islands are a collaboration between the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Oregon State University, and Floating Islands West, a Floating Island International license holder.

A US Army Corps of Engineers project was built in 2012 in The Hideout, Pennsylvania, as part of a watershed management project. The floating island was created to mimic nature; help improve water quality, including reducing phosphorus levels; and buffer habitats against surges in nutrients and pollution.

Buoyancy in artificial floating reedbeds is commonly provided by polyethylene or polyurethane foam, or polyethylene plastic containing air voids. Growth media include coconut fibre; mats made of polyester or recycled PET bottles; synthetic geotechnical mat; jute; soil; and sand.

Artificial floating islands are sometimes made by planting cattails and other plants on floating plastic rafts in order to reduce phosphorus levels in the water. In Cleveland&#x27;s Cuyahoga River floating rafts were made to restore fish populations.

Artificial floating islands have been sought out as structures for different habitational and industrial purposes, e.g. floating oil rigs.

<doc id="951437" wikidata="Q719372" url="?curid=951437" title="Casey Donovan (actor)">
<text>John Calvin Culver (November 2, 1943 – August 10, 1987), better known under his stage name Casey Donovan, was an American male pornographic film actor from the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, appearing primarily in adult films and videos catering to gay male audiences, during the Golden Age of Porn. Following a brief career as a Latin teacher and a stint as a highly-paid male model, Donovan appeared in &quot;Boys in the Sand&quot; (1971), the film that would cement his status as a gay icon. Attempts to build on his notoriety to achieve mainstream crossover success failed, but Donovan continued to be a bankable star in the adult industry for the next 15 years. He was briefly a mainstream actor, who appeared on stage, as well as a theatre producer and manager, and appeared as himself in TV series &quot;The Emerald City&quot;.

==Early life==
Culver was born in East Bloomfield, New York, growing up there with his parents and older brother Duane.

Culver attended the State University of New York at Geneseo (SUNY), where he was a member of Phi Sigma Epsilon fraternity and the drama club. After graduation in 1965 he accepted a teaching position in Peekskill, New York. He later took a job at the private Ethical Culture Fieldston School on New York City&#x27;s Central Park West but was fired during his second year following an altercation in which he physically disciplined a female student (reportedly the daughter of actor Eli Wallach).

Following his dismissal, Culver drifted into prostitution. He also began pursuing an acting career, appearing in summer stock theatre with the Peterborough Players.

==Modeling career==
Through one of his escorting clients, Culver landed a spot with the Wilhelmina Models modeling agency, commanding an hourly rate of US$60 (equivalent to $400 in 2020).

He continued to pursue stage work, landing an understudy job in 1969 in the Off-Broadway gay-themed play &quot;And Puppy Dog Tails&quot;, making his Broadway debut in 1970 in the Native American-themed production &quot;Brave&quot; and a co-starring role in the off-Broadway play &quot;Circle in the Water&quot; (also in 1970).

==Adult film career==
In 1971, Culver played a supporting role in a low-budget sexploitation thriller film called &quot;Ginger&quot;. While the film was a commercial and critical failure, &quot;Variety&quot; noted his performance positively, saying &quot;Only Calvin Culver ... shows any indication of better things to come.&quot; This in turn led to an offer to appear in &quot;Casey&quot;, a gay pornographic film in which Culver played the title role, a gay man who is visited by his fairy godmother Wanda (Culver playing a dual role in drag), and is granted a series of wishes which make him sexually irresistible to other men. Culver later took the title character&#x27;s name, Casey, and that of the popular Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan to create the pseudonym under which he would appear in all his other erotic roles.

Culver was first credited under the &quot;Casey Donovan&quot; name in &quot;Boys in the Sand&quot; (1971), directed by Wakefield Poole. The film was an instant success and is considered a classic of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities open to him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film &quot;Score,&quot; &quot;The Back Row&quot; with George Payne, &quot;L. A. Tool &amp; Die&quot; with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, &quot;The Other Side of Aspen&quot; with Al Parker, Steve Turk and Dick Fisk, &quot;Boys in the Sand II&quot; and &quot;Inevitable Love&quot;, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo.

Shortly before his death he starred, appearing heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie &quot;Fucked Up&quot;, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; where he had a scene with Constance Money, in which he plays a gay male art dealer who is seduced by a woman.

==Mainstream acting career==
Outside his adult film career, Donovan continued to pursue stage work. In 1972, he was cast in a short-lived Broadway revival of &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;. Star Ingrid Bergman described him as &quot;having the same kind and as much charisma as Robert Redford.&quot; He then landed a small role in the 1973 Lincoln Center production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, which was praised as having &quot;vivid appeal.&quot; In 1974, Donovan starred as Brian, a gay bathhouse attendant, in the play &quot;Tubstrip&quot;, written and directed by Jerry Douglas, which had successful runs in Los Angeles and San Francisco before moving to Broadway. While the play was critically deemed entertaining enough to its target gay audience (having earned, in the words of one critic, a &quot;nationwide gay housekeeping seal of approval&quot;) Donovan himself was judged as simply &quot;no better nor worse [an] actor than most of the others [in the cast].&quot; In 1983, he turned his hand to producing, with an unsuccessful Broadway revival of Terrence McNally&#x27;s play &quot;The Ritz&quot; in which he also appeared.

Donovan&#x27;s iconic status allowed him to build a lucrative career as a high-priced prostitute, though it would cost him his legitimate modeling career as more and more clients made the connection between model Culver and porn star Donovan. He wrote an advice column, &quot;Ask Casey,&quot; for the gay-oriented &quot;Stallion&quot; magazine beginning in 1982.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Donovan met actor-turned-writer Tom Tryon, and the two entered into a long-term relationship the following year. Tryon was deeply closeted and grew increasingly disturbed by Donovan&#x27;s notoriety. Their relationship ended in 1977.

In 1978, Donovan purchased a house in Key West, Florida, to run as a bed and breakfast dubbed &quot;Casa Donovan.&quot; He struggled to keep it and the business eventually failed. More successful was his time as a celebrity tour guide, conducting all-gay trips in partnership with an outfit called Star Tours to Italy, China, Peru and other destinations.

==Later years and death==
By 1985, Donovan&#x27;s health had begun to deteriorate after he contracted HIV. Although he had counseled his fans through his &quot;Ask Casey&quot; column as early as 1982 to take steps to avoid contracting HIV by reducing their number of sexual partners and urging his fans to be tested for HIV once the test was developed, Donovan did not heed his own advice. He made little or no effort to change his own behavior despite knowing that contracting HIV was then considered terminal, with virtually no treatment options.

On August 10, 1987, Donovan died of an HIV/AIDS-related pulmonary infection in Inverness, Florida, aged 43.

<doc id="951441" wikidata="Q2288436" url="?curid=951441" title="Footmouse">
<text>A footmouse (or foot mouse) is a type of computer mouse that gives the users the ability to move the cursor and click the mouse buttons with their feet.

It is primarily used by users with disabilities or with high-back or neck problems. It is also promoted as a way to prevent such problems in the future and as a means to increase productivity by not having to move one&#x27;s hand between the keyboard and mouse.

== Types ==
There are about ten types of footmouse. Not all of them are commercially available. Some specialized companies design their own foot controlled mouse for disabled people.

The main difference between the different types of footmouse is a flat pedal which slides or a pedal which tilts. There also exists a mouse adapter which converts a conventional mouse to a footmouse that slides and horizontally tilts to one side. A footmouse that uses sliding can be a slipper with a mouse connected to it, or a special frame in which a pedal can move around. Also a tiny magnet or other location device can be used on a tablet. A footmouse that uses a tilting pedal has one or two pedals which are able to tilt and turn in one or more directions. 
Buttons that are pushed by the feet are not considered footmice.

== Use ==
Using a footmouse is slower than a regular mouse (a handmouse), since most people have less control over precise movements with their feet and legs than with their hands. (Human-computer interaction researchers note even though people commonly use foot to control cars, sewing machines, or speech transcription equipment, foot-operated controls are used in these applications for starting and stopping, rather than navigating.)

If the footmouse is used together with a keyboard, the cursor can be moved around while typing, so there is no time wasted for moving the hand between the keyboard and the mouse.
If a person cannot use a keyboard, a virtual keyboard on the screen can be used to type text by clicking each character on the virtual keyboard. People who also have less control over their foot and leg movement and are unable to operate a footmouse can sometimes use a few switches for setting the cursor in a certain direction.

If a footmouse is used incorrectly for a long time, it can cause muscle cramp in the legs, and can have a negative influence on lower back problems.

==History==
Footmice were available in the US market as early as 1985. The manufacturer that promoted them at the time was called Versatron.

<doc id="951444" wikidata="Q5278782" url="?curid=951444" title="Diocesan Girls' School">
<text>Diocesan Girls&#x27; School (DGS; ) is one of the oldest girls&#x27; schools in Hong Kong, operated by the Anglican Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui () to provide a well-rounded secondary education for girls.

==Structure==
DGS is governed by the Council of the Diocesan Girls&#x27; School. Having run as a grant-aided school since it was founded, the school changed to an operation in the Direct Subsidy Scheme mode starting with Secondary One classes in September 2005. English is the medium of instruction. By 2024, DGS accounted for a total of 52 winners of the Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards, ranking first among all secondary schools in Hong Kong, and outnumbering the combined number of winners of the next two schools. The school is also a member of the G20 Schools group. It has a &quot;feeder&quot; primary school known as Diocesan Girls&#x27; Junior School (&quot;DGJS&quot;).

==History==

===Pre-war===
There was a Diocesan Native Female Training School founded in 1860 at Bonham Road and Eastern Street on Hong Kong Island. That school was set up by Lady Lydia Smith, the wife of George Smith, who was the first Bishop of Victoria sent by the Society for Promotion of Female Education in the East, a sub-society of the London Missionary Society. At first, it admitted only girls. In 1866, it was renamed Diocesan Female Training &amp; Industrial Schools. Because of financial problems, the school had to restrict its services solely to orphans and destitute girls. 

In 1869, Diocesan Home and Orphanage was founded to admit both boys and girls, and occupied the building at the corner of Eastern Street and Bonham Road.

Diocesan Girls&#x27; School and Orphanage first received government financial assistance in 1900 when it was opened in Rose Villas as a Church of England School principally for Eurasian and European girls. It was placed under the grant-in-aid scheme, officially establishing itself as a girls&#x27; school.

In 1913, the school moved to its present site at 1 Jordan Road, Kowloon, formerly a rice paddy field. In the 1920s, the school motto, &quot;Daily Giving Service&quot;, was adopted. During the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, the school was taken over as headquarters of the Japanese Kempeitai until it was re-opened in September 1945 by Ms. Gibbins, then headmistress, who was interned at Stanley camp during the occupation. Immediately upon her release, she hurried back to reclaim the school premises despite difficulty in crossing the harbour, thus saving the building from being looted.

===Post war===

In the 1950s, with the closure of the adjacent town-gas depot, the school was able to expand. The old Edwardian edifice was pulled down, and three school blocks were constructed to accommodate the enlarged student body. The school embarked on a large scale school expansion project, and two extension blocks were opened respectively in 1993 and 1996. The new phase of expansion had been completed and was opened officially on 12 January 2007.

In 2005, DGS joined the Direct Subsidy Scheme, in the view to enhance the facilities to meet the demand of increased number of classes. In site redevelopment has been chosen against the use of a new site provided by the Education Bureau, based on cost considerations. The new school campus was designed by architects Palmer and Turner, and the preliminary designs was reviewed by a group of alumni. A fund-raising campaign was launched in 2008 for the redevelopment of the old school campus, which targets on HKD 380 million. In 2009, the classes in DGS were temporarily relocated to 101 Castle Peak Road, Sham Shui Po, whereas DGJS was moved to Tseung Kwan O during the reconstruction. In September 2011, the school returned to 1 Jordan Road upon completion of the new campus.

The total number of top performers ranks the 2nd amongst all secondary schools in Hong Kong.

<text>The Big Bubble is an album released by American art rock group The Residents in 1985. The album is presented as the debut of fictional garage rock band &quot;the Big Bubble&quot;, composed of four &quot;Cross&quot; band members – &quot;Cross&quot; being the resulting mixture between the Mole Trilogy&#x27;s two contrasting factions, the Moles and the Chubs.

The album was subtitled &quot;Part Four of the Mole Trilogy –&quot; it was decided to extend the trilogy into a hexalogy, in which odd-numbered parts would detail the plot while even-numbered parts would elaborate on the cultural aspect of the two warring factions in the story. However, &quot;The Big Bubble&quot; was the last finished work related to the project before it was cancelled due to sheer disinterest and focus on other projects.

== Music ==
The music on &quot;The Big Bubble&quot; is designed for a garage rock setting – instrumentation consists of guitars, drums, vocals and keyboards – and most of the album&#x27;s lyrics are gibberish, presented as &quot;the forbidden language of the Mohelmot&quot; (one of the two races involved in the story). Vocals were recorded before the instruments to achieve a &quot;live&quot; sound.

== Artwork ==
The album cover of &quot;The Big Bubble&quot; is actually presented &quot;inside&quot; another cover – it&#x27;s implied that the album is actually titled &quot;Part Four of the Mole Trilogy,&quot; while presenting the cover for the self-titled album of a fictional band called the Big Bubble. In similar fashion, the album&#x27;s back cover shows the fictional album&#x27;s back cover, and the gatefold spread shows the fictional album&#x27;s gatefold spread. The same applies for the record labels (the fictional album is published by &quot;Black Shroud&quot; Records).

The fictional album&#x27;s front cover generated attention due to its showing of four unmasked band members – it was rumored that these band members were, in fact, the Residents. However, the Cryptic Corporation later confirmed that the four were just models who had responded to an ad. The group&#x27;s frontman was portrayed by Kyle Newell, who would go on to be a stage technician for the 13th Anniversary Show. Another of the members had come abroad from Europe, where he was first spotted in the audience at a Residents concert.

== Reception ==

&quot;The Big Bubble&quot; is one of the Residents&#x27; most polarizing albums. Critical reception was heavily mixed. While writer Cole Gagne, in his book &quot;Sonic Transports,&quot; considers the album &quot;brilliant,&quot; writer Ian Shirley says in his book &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; that the album was &quot;treading water.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; said, &quot; The Big Bubble, strangely enough, bears the usual Residents signatures: sludgy synthesizer threnodies pump underneath garbled vocals sung by what sounds like an inbred Louisiana lumberjack. Pure genius, so to speak.&quot;

Despite this, the album was surprisingly successful in Japan, where it was being distributed by Wave Records. As a result, Wave requested that the Residents perform in Tokyo, proposing to cover all expenses. This performance was developed into the 13th Anniversary Show which eventually also toured Europe, Australia and the United States.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by the Residents.

The fictional sleeve lists all songs as written by Frank Leone (guitarist) and Ramsey Whiten (drummer/singer), except &quot;Fear for the Future&quot;, written by Paul Sage (keyboardist).

=== 2019 pREServed edition (&quot;Mole Box&quot;) ===
A deluxe box set pertaining to the entire Mole Trilogy concept was released in 2019. It contained newly remastered editions of &quot;Mark of the Mole&quot;, &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;The Big Bubble&quot;, as well as recordings of the Mole Show and a sixth disc of miscellaneous recordings related to the project. Disc Three is shown here for its relevance.

<text>The Pascack Valley Regional High School District is a regional public high school district encompassing students from four communities in the Pascack Valley region of Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, serving students in ninth through twelfth grades from Hillsdale, Montvale, River Vale and Woodcliff Lake.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the district, comprising two schools, had an enrollment of 1,867 students and 172.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.8:1.

The district is classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group &quot;I&quot;, the second-highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.

==History==
In 1955, Pascack Valley Regional High School District opened Pascack Valley High School with an enrollment of 650 students from the boroughs of Hillsdale, Montvale, River Vale, and Woodcliff Lake, having bonded $1,250,000 towards the costs of construction. Previously, students from those municipalities attended other local high schools, including Westwood High School. Students from Hillsdale, Montvale and Woodcliff Lake had attended Park Ridge High School. With increasing enrollment as the suburbs boomed, the towns, with state approval, formed a regional high school district.

During the next several years enrollment increased and so did the faculty and building capacity. Additional classrooms were added and the program of studies was expanded. Increased enrollment in 1963 resulted in double sessions. In September 1964, Pascack Hills High School opened up to students living in Montvale, Woodcliff Lake and a portion of Hillsdale, with a flexible scheduling program that allowed students to select courses using a system run by an analyst from International Telephone and Telegraph using a mainframe computer system. Pascack Valley High School had the balance of Hillsdale students and all of River Vale students. In the early 1990s, western portions of Hillsdale (west of Pascack Road) transitioned from sending to Pascack Hills to Pascack Valley.

By 1970, the enrollment was again up to capacity and building construction was necessary to house 1,800 students. This expansion of Pascack Valley High School provided additional classrooms, expanded department areas, and other facilities such as gymnasium, a new cafeteria and library.

In March 2008, the district announced plans to offer online courses, beginning in the 2008–09 school year, with that school year&#x27;s seniors being given priority.

In July 2020 the district board of education voted to eliminate both the PVHS &quot;Indians&quot; and the &quot;Cowboys&quot; at Pascack Hills High School. In March 2021, the board of education ratified new team names that had been selected by a vote of students and staff at each school, with Pascack Hills being renamed the Broncos and Pascack Valley adopting the Panthers as its new team name.

==Awards and recognition==
*In the 2000–01 school year, Pascack Valley Regional High School was recognized with the Best Practices Award by the New Jersey Department of Education for its &quot;Senior Projects/Senior Alternate Assessment Program&quot;.
*Pascack Hills High School was the 7th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2014 cover story on the state&#x27;s &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot;, using a new ranking methodology, after having been ranked 18th in the state out of 328 schools in 2012; Pascack Valley High School was ranked 39th in 2014 and 73rd in 2012. 
*The Pascack Pi-oneers, a district-wide high school robotics team, has won several regional awards.

==Schools==
Schools in the district (with 2021–22 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are:
* Pascack Hills High School opened in Montvale in 1964 and served 999 students in grades 9-12 from Montvale and Woodcliff Lake.
**Timothy Wieland, principal
* Pascack Valley High School in Hillsdale opened in 1955 and served 999 students in grades 9-12 from Hillsdale and River Vale.
**John Puccio Jr., principal 
*Park Academy is a therapeutic middle school program operated as part of the Region II / Pascack Valley Council for Special Education that is focused on preparing students for mainstream education in their home district.

==Administration==
Core members of the district&#x27;s administration are:
* Sarah Bilotti, superintendent She assumed the position as superintendent in July 2022, after seven years heading the North Warren Regional School District.
* Yas Usami, business administrator and board secretary

==Board of education==
The district&#x27;s board of education, comprised of nine members, sets policy and oversees the fiscal and educational operation of the district through its administration. As a Type II school district, the board&#x27;s trustees are elected directly by voters to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the district&#x27;s day-to-day operations and a business administrator to supervise the business functions of the district. Seats on the board of education are allocated based on the population of the constituent districts, with three assigned to Hillsdale and two each assigned to Montvale, River Vale and Woodcliff Lake.

<text>Community of Urbana-Champaign Cooperative Housing, or COUCH, is an association of housing cooperatives in Urbana and Champaign, Illinois. It is a member of North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO).

COUCH began in 1997 as an umbrella organization for the independent housing co-ops in the Champaign–Urbana area, but was also founded with the vision of creating a larger co-op community to advance co-oping, establish community, and achieve economies of scale within the co-op community. It currently consists of three houses:
*Gwendolyn Brooks Cooperative (Urbana), a 14-member house, opened its doors as a member-controlled co-op house in August 2001.
*Harvest House Cooperative (Urbana), another 14-member house, was also founded in 2001.
*Randolph (Champaign), a 9-member house, was founded in 2019 and acquired by COUCH in 2022.

These housing co-ops provide affordable housing to residents of Urbana and Champaign. Each room is rented out separately, and each room is priced according to its size. On top of rent, each tenant pays a separate bill for utilities and food. Although rules change from house to house, it is customary that every night, one or two people cook for the house and in return, they are cooked for the other 6 nights of the week. Some houses are vegan or vegetarian, while other houses serve meat. Many commodities are included for free including free access to a washer and dryer and free printing. Many houses allow pets.

<doc id="951465" wikidata="Q2704031" url="?curid=951465" title="Giacomo Cavedone">
<text>Giacomo Cavedone (also called &quot;Giacomo Cavedoni&quot;; 1577–1660) was an Italian Baroque painter of the Bolognese School.

==Life==
He belonged to the generation of Carracci-inspired or trained painters that included Giovanni Andrea Donducci (Mastelletta); Alessandro Tiarini, Lucio Massari, Leonello Spada and Lorenzo Garbieri. 
He was born in Sassuolo, near Modena, and was able to obtain a three-year stipend to apprentice with Bernardino Baldi and Annibale Carracci. 
In the autumn of 1609, he sojourned in Rome for a year to work under Guido Reni, and is known to have worked in Venice from 1612 to 1613. 
He became one of Ludovico Carracci&#x27;s primary assistants, and upon Ludovico&#x27;s death in 1619 became &quot;Caposindaco&quot; of the &quot;Accademia degli Incamminati&quot;.

His career as a painter was cut short by a set of misfortunes; these included a 1623 fall from a church scaffold and, in 1630, the death of his wife and children from the plague. The &quot;1911 Britannica&quot; (where he is incorrectly called &quot;Jacopo Cavendone&quot;) claims his wife was accused of witchcraft. 
He lived until 1660, and died in poverty.
His principal works are the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, the &quot;Four Doctors&quot;, &quot;Last Supper&quot;; and his masterpiece, the large altar painting in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna, &quot;Virgin and Child in Glory with Saints Petronio and Alo&quot; (1614). This painting was originally made for the chapel of the guild of metal-workers in church of the Mendicanti. While this painting has a traditional Ludovico Carracci-inspired structure, with a Madonna and her wafting robes hovering above donors, it also has an unusually rich Titianesque coloring for an Emilian painter. Among his pupils were Giovanni Andrea Sirani, Giovanni Battista Cavazza, Ottavio Corradi, and Flaminio Torre.

<text>Tetley is an English beverage manufacturer founded in 1837 in Yorkshire. It is the largest company of tea in the United Kingdom and Canada, and the second-largest in the United States by volume.

Since 2000, Tetley has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Consumer Products (formerly Tata Global Beverages), making it the second-largest manufacturer of teas in the world, after Unilever. 

==History==

In 1822, brothers Joseph and Edward Tetley sold salt from a pack horse in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. They started to sell tea and were so successful they set up as &quot;Joseph Tetley &amp; Co.&quot; tea merchants in 1837. Relocating to London in 1856, they formed &quot;Joseph Tetley &amp; Company, Wholesale Tea Dealers&quot;, in partnership with Joseph Ackland.

In 1952, in an early example of cross promotion, Petula Clark&#x27;s single &quot;Anytime Is Tea Time Now&quot; was used to advertise Tetley on Radio Luxembourg. Tetley was the first company to sell tea in tea-bags in the United Kingdom in 1953. In 1989, following extensive consumer tests establishing Britons&#x27; preferences, Tetley launched the round tea bag.

In 1973 the Tetley company was acquired by J. Lyons and Co. to form Lyons-Tetley. Following mergers, Lyons became part of Allied Lyons and then Allied Domecq.

The Tetley Group was created in July 1995, as a result of a buy in management buy out, when a group of investors bought the worldwide beverage business from Allied Domecq. The Tetley Group was bought by India&#x27;s Tata Group in February 2000, for £271 million.

It was one of the largest overseas acquisitions by an Indian company at that time. The Tata Group is one of India&#x27;s largest business conglomerates, comprising more than one hundred companies, including Tata Consumer Products. The acquisition has helped Tata&#x27;s business ambitions to hold a global tea company.

As India reduced import duties on tea, Tata Consumer Products offset its reduced share of the domestic market by gains in Europe and North America. In April 2014, Columbia Law School and &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that some of Tetley&#x27;s tea is harvested by workers who do not receive the minimum wage in India.

In a statement placed on its website, Tetley&#x27;s parent company, Tata Consumer Products, announced it had &quot;appointed legal advisors to verify compliances by independent review. The legal advisors will also appoint and commission an independent third party Solidaridad to make an assessment into the living and working conditions of the workers at the APPL plantations (Amalgamated Plantations Private Limited).&quot;

The company has claimed that tea from APPL plantations is not used in Tetley tea internationally, and that APPL has supplied only one small shipment of Assam tea for use in Tetley in India in the last three years. In October 2014, UNICEF announced that they are working with tea companies and with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) to tackle child exploitation in Indian tea communities. The three-year program is funded by a number of advocacy groups, Tata Consumer Products, and Tesco.

== Operations ==
Tetley&#x27;s manufacturing and distribution business operates in forty countries, selling over sixty branded tea bags. In the early days of Tetley&#x27;s operations, the company was solely a distributor of tea as it did not have any plantations to call its own, which meant that the company had to buy tea leaves through auctions. This led to the final product having a blend of 40 different types of tea from over 10,000 tea estates all over the world. Its premium packaging and quality helped it gain tremendous amounts of market share. By 1990, with a yearly production of 20 billion teabags, Tetley had gained the title of the second largest tea brand in the world after Lipton. It was only after the acquisition of Tetley by the then Tata Tea, that the company&#x27;s supply chains were finally consolidated with those of Tata Tea. This led to most of Tetley&#x27;s tea leaves now originating from Tata&#x27;s plantations across India and Sri Lanka.

<doc id="951499" wikidata="Q4762109" url="?curid=951499" title="Ángel Cordero Jr.">
<text>Ángel Tomás Cordero Jr. (born November 8, 1942) is a Puerto Rican jockey. He is known for being one of the winningest Thoroughbred horse racing jockeys of the late 20th-century and the first Puerto Rican to be inducted into the United States&#x27; Racing Hall of Fame. He led all jockeys in wins at Saratoga Race Course for thirteen years. Cordero rode three Kentucky Derby winners and won over 6000 races in his career.

==Early years==

Cordero was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico where he began racing at a young age. His father, Ángel Cordero Sr., was a rider and Throughbred trainer. His grandfather and uncles were also riders and horse trainers. His hometown in America is on Long Island, NY.

==American Classic Races==
Cordero was the first Puerto Rican jockey to win all three of the American Classic Races, the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes, though not all in the same year.

In 1974, when he was 31, Cordero won the Kentucky Derby aboard Cannonade. He won the Derby twice more, making him one of only eight jockeys to win the race three or more times in the Derby&#x27;s history. In 1976, he won on Bold Forbes and in 1985, on Spend A Buck. In 1976, Cordero won the Belmont Stakes on Bold Forbes, and he won the Preakness Stakes twice, once in 1980 aboard Codex (his winning status was not overturned despite widely publicized accusations of illegal block-maneuvering and face-lashing of opponent-filly Genuine Risk with his whip) and the second time in 1984, aboard Gate Dancer.

Among his other accomplishments, Cordero was the winner of four Breeders&#x27; Cup races and was the leading rider at Saratoga Race Course for thirteen years. In 1987, Cordero became the fourth jockey to win over 6,000 races.

In 1992, Cordero&#x27;s career was cut short after a fall which nearly cost him his life. His spleen was removed due to the accident that occurred at Aqueduct. However, against the wishes of his family and friends, in 1995, Cordero saddled up again to ride the Breeders&#x27; Cup once more.

==Later years==
Cordero has now retired from riding, but continues to be involved in the sport full-time. He was the agent of fellow Puerto Rican horse jockey, John Velazquez. Cordero&#x27;s wife, Marjorie Clayton Cordero, who was also a well-known figure in New York&#x27;s thoroughbred racing, died on January 22, 2001. Cordero is the father of five children.

Cordero was inducted into National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1988 and in 2001, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010 he was inducted into the African-American Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame.

In an interview in December 2021, Cordero spoke about his life-long friendship with Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda, who he considers his brother.

In 2021, Cordero was based in New York full-time and working with Manuel Franco, a Puerto Rican jockey.

<doc id="951506" wikidata="Q540088" url="?curid=951506" title="Yelverton, Devon">
<text>Yelverton is a large village on the south-western edge of Dartmoor, Devon, in England. It is in the civil parish of Buckland Monachorum. According to the 2021 census, it had a population of 1,858, which was slightly more than the 1,810 recorded at the 2011 census.

When Yelverton railway station (on the Great Western Railway (GWR) line from Plymouth to Tavistock) opened in the 19th century, the village became a popular residence for Plymouth commuters. The railway is now closed, but the Plym Valley Railway has reopened a section of it.

The Anglican parish church of St Paul was built in 1910-1912 and is a grade II listed building. Yelverton is one of six parishes which form the West Dartmoor Mission Community, within the Tavistock Deanery of the Diocese of Exeter. Holy Cross Catholic Church was built as a chapel in the early 1920s and upgraded to a church in 1928. It is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth, and is built in a &quot;simplified Gothic style&quot;. Rock Methodist Church is also in Yelverton.
Yelverton is well known for Roborough Rock - a prominent mass of stone close to the Plymouth road on the fringe of nearby Roborough Down, near the southern end of the airfield. It gave its name to the Rock Hotel, built as a farm during the Elizabethan period, but converted in the 1850s to cater for growing tourism in the area. The area to the south and west of the roundabout at the centre of the village was settled in late Victorian and Edwardian times, with many grand and opulent villas. An area developed at about the same time on an odd shaped piece of land to the south of the Tavistock road is known as Leg o&#x27; Mutton Corner.

At the beginning of the Second World War, an airfield (RAF Harrowbeer) was constructed at adjacent Harrowbeer as a fighter station for the air defence of Devonport Dockyard and the Western Approaches. A 19th century terrace of houses, now mostly converted into shops, had to have its upper storey removed to provide an easier approach. One tall building which was not altered was St. Paul&#x27;s Church, but the tower was hit by a plane, resulting in a warning light being fitted. The layout of the runways is still very clear and although they are substantially grassed over, the many earth and brick protective bunkers built to protect the fighters from attack on the ground are all still in place. Some American airmen and anti-aircraft battery units were stationed here during the second half of the war. A plane carrying President Roosevelt landed here when its original destination was fogbound.

To the south of the village is Langton Park, home of Yelverton Bohemians Cricket Club, and about 0.5 km south is Moorland Garden Hotel, serving Yelverton Golf Club, where most of the holes run well down the open moorland to the east. There are several bed-and-breakfasts in Yelverton, serving the many walkers and visitors to National Trust properties in the area.

==Notable people==

*Former Sadlers Wells Ballet star Maureen Bruce lives in Yelverton.
*General Sir Frank Kitson lived in Yelverton after retiring from the Army.
*Seth Lakeman, the Mercury Music Prize nominee, comes from Yelverton.
*The present Ravenscroft Care Home was built as a private house but in the 1930s became Ravenscroft School and during the Second World War was the officers&#x27; mess of RAF Harrowbeer.

==Transport==

===Rail=== 
Yelverton used to have a railway station built in the 19th century. The line ran to Tavistock and Plymouth, but has closed.

===Road===
Yelverton sits on the A386, which runs to Tavistock and Okehampton in the north and Plymouth in the south.

===Bus Services===
Yelverton is served by Stagecoach&#x27;s service 1 between Tavistock and Plymouth. It also has Plymouth Citybus running a rural service towards Dartmoor.

===Coach Services===
Lomax Tours run coach excursions throughout the year from Yelverton to places of interest such as Bath Christmas Market, Lyme Regis, RHS Rosemoor flower shows etc.

<text>The 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair () was the large world exposition that was held from 1 May to 31 October 1873 in the Austria-Hungarian capital Vienna. Its motto was &quot;Culture and Education&quot; ().

==History==
As well as being a chance to showcase Austro-Hungarian industry and culture, the World&#x27;s Fair in Vienna commemorated Franz JosephI&#x27;s 25th year as emperor. The main grounds were in the Prater, a park near the Danube River, and preparations cost £23.4 million. It lasted from May 1 to November 2, hosting about 7,225,000 visitors.

==Facilities==
There were almost 26,000 exhibitors housed in different buildings that were erected for this exposition, including the &quot;Rotunda&quot; (), a large circular building in the great park of Prater designed by the Scottish engineer John Scott Russell. (The fair Rotunda was destroyed by fire on 17 September 1937.)

===Russian pavilion===
The Russian pavilion had a naval section designed by Viktor Hartmann. Exhibits included models of the Port of Rijeka and the Illés Relief model of Jerusalem.

===Japanese pavilion===
The Japanese exhibition at the fair was the product of years of preparation. The empire had received its invitation in 1871, close on the heels of the Meiji Restoration, and a government bureau was established to produce an appropriate response. Shigenobu Okuma, Tsunetami Sano, and its other officials were keen to use the event to raise the international standing of Japanese manufactures and boost exports. 24 engineers were also sent with its delegation to study cutting-edge Western engineering at the fair for use in Japanese industry. Art and cultural relics at the exhibit were verified by the Jinshin Survey, a months-long inspection tour of various imperial, noble, and temple holdings around the country. The most important products of each province were listed and two specimens of each were collected, one for display in Vienna and the other for preservation and display within Japan. Large-scale preparatory exhibitions with this second set of objects were conducted within Japan at the Tokyo Kaisei School (today the University of Tokyo) in 1871 and at the capital&#x27;s Confucian Temple in 1872; they eventually formed the core collection of the institution that became the Tokyo National Museum.

Forty-one Japanese officials and government interpreters, as well as six Europeans in Japanese employ, came to Vienna to oversee the pavilion and the fair&#x27;s cultural events. 25 craftsmen and gardeners created the main pavilion, as well as a full Japanese garden with shrine and a model of the former pagoda at Tokyo&#x27;s imperial temple. Apart from the collection of regional objects, which focused on ceramics, cloisonné wares, lacquerware, and textiles, the displays also included the female golden shachi from Nagoya Castle and a &quot;papier-maché&quot; copy of the Kamakura Buddha. The year after the fair, Sano compiled a report on it which ran to 96 volumes divided into 16 parts, including a strong plea for the creation of a museum on western lines in the Japanese capital; the government further began hosting national industrial exhibitions at Ueno Park in 1877.

&quot;Le Nil&quot;, a French Ship, set off from the port of Triest to Japan loaded with a number of items from the fair, in total 192 boxes. It sank off the Izu Peninsula on March 20, 1874. Some items of art were later recovered. One of the items is a ceramic square dish with grapes by Ogata Kenzan that was exhibited and was recovered.

===Ottoman pavilion===
Osman Hamdi Bey, an archaeologist and painter, was chosen by the Ottoman government as commissary of the empire&#x27;s exhibits in Vienna. He organized the Ottoman pavilion with Victor Marie de Launay, a French-born Ottoman official and archivist, who had written the catalogue for the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s exhibition at the 1867 Paris World&#x27;s Fair. The Ottoman pavilion, located near the Egyptian pavilion (which had its own pavilion despite being a territory of the Ottoman Empire), in the park outside the Rotunde, included small replicas of notable Ottoman buildings and models of vernacular architecture: a replica of the Fountain of Ahmed III at Topkapı Palace, a model Istanbul residence, a representative hamam, a cafe, and a bazaar. The 1873 Ottoman pavilion was more prominent than its pavilion in 1867. The Vienna exhibition set off Western nations&#x27; pavilions against Eastern pavilions, with the host, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, setting itself at the juncture between East and West. A report by the Ottoman commission for the exhibition expressed a goal of inspiring with their display &quot;a serious interest [in the Ottoman Empire] on the part of the industrialists, traders, artists, and scholars of other nations...&quot;

The Ottoman pavilion included a gallery of mannequins wearing the traditional costumes of many of the varied ethnic groups of the Ottoman Empire. To supplement the cases of costumes, Osman Hamdi and de Launay created a photographic book of Ottoman costumes, the &quot;Elbise-i &#x27;Osmaniyye&quot; (&quot;Les costumes populaires de la Turquie&quot;), with photographs by Pascal Sébah. The photographic plates of the &quot;Elbise&quot; depicted traditional Ottoman costumes, commissioned from artisans working in the administrative divisions (vilayets) of the Empire, worn by men, women, and children who resembled the various ethnic and religious types of the empire, though the models were all found in Istanbul. The photographs are accompanied by texts describing the costumes in detail and commenting on the rituals and habits of the regions and ethnic groups in question.

===Italian pavilion===
Professor Lodovico Brunetti of Padua, Italy first displayed cremated ashes at the exhibition. He showed a model of the crematory, one of the first modern ones. He exhibited it with a sign reading, &quot;Vermibus erepti, puro consummimur igni,&quot; in English, &quot;Saved from the worms, we are consumed by the flames.&quot;

===New Zealand pavilion===
New Zealand was represented at the 1873 Vienna International Exposition by a collection of Māori clubs, mats and cloaks, as well as gold, woodwork, kauri gum and geological specimens. Photographs of New Zealand scenery were shown and examples of flour and beer were provided by local industries. A collection of birds was prepared by a London taxidermist and Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary was said to have been &quot;astonished&quot; by a pair of moa skeletons from the Canterbury Museum. More than 50 awards were collected by New Zealand exhibitors but, apparently, because of a problem of categorisation on the part of the jurors, the moa display was not among them.

<text>Assorted Secrets is a compilation of live and studio rehearsals released by American art rock group the Residents in 1984, originally as a cassette-only release due to the recording and performance quality not meeting the group&#x27;s standards at the time. Not originally meant to be heard by the public, the cassette was eventually produced and released for much-needed profit following the financial difficulties of the Mole Show tour.

<text>Kunta Kinte ( ; – ) is a fictional character in the 1976 novel &quot;&quot; by American author Alex Haley. Kunta Kinte was based on family oral tradition accounts of one of Haley&#x27;s ancestors, a Gambian man who was born around 1767, enslaved, and taken to America where he died around 1822. Haley said that his account of Kunta&#x27;s life in &quot;Roots&quot; is a mixture of fact and fiction.

Kunta Kinte&#x27;s life story figured in two US television series based on the book: the original 1977 TV miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, and a 2016 remake of the same name. In the original miniseries, the character was portrayed as a teenager by LeVar Burton and as an adult by John Amos. In the 2016 miniseries, he is portrayed by Malachi Kirby. Burton reprised his role in the 1988 TV movie &quot;&quot;.

==Biography in &quot;Roots&quot; novel==
According to the book &quot;&quot;, Kunta Kinte was born circa 1750 in the Mandinka village of Jufureh, in the Gambia. He was raised in a Muslim family. In 1767, while Kunta was searching for wood to make a drum for himself, four men chased him, surrounded him, and took him captive. Kunta awoke to find himself blindfolded, gagged, bound, and a prisoner. He and others were put on the slave ship the &quot;Lord Ligonier&quot; for a four-month Middle Passage voyage to North America.
Kunta survived the trip to Maryland and was sold to a John Waller (1741–1775), son of William Waller (1714–1760) and grandson of John Waller (1673–1754) (Reynolds in the 1977 miniseries), a Virginia plantation owner in Spotsylvania County, who renamed him Toby (named by John&#x27;s wife Elizabeth in the 2016 remake). He rejected the name imposed upon him by his owners and refused to speak to others. After being recaptured during the last of his four escape attempts, the slave catchers gave him an ultimatum: he would be castrated or have his right foot cut off. He chose to have his foot cut off, and the men cut off the front half of his right foot. As the years passed, Kunta, now owned by John&#x27;s brother Dr. William Waller, resigned himself to his fate and became more open and sociable with his fellow slaves, while never forgetting his identity and origin.

Kunta married an enslaved woman named Bell and they had a daughter named Kizzy (Keisa, in Mandinka), which in Kunta&#x27;s native language means &quot;you sit down&quot; or &quot;you stay put&quot;, to protect her from being sold away as Bell had been sold away from her two infant children many decades earlier. When Kizzy was in her late teens, she was sold away to North Carolina when William Waller discovered that she had written a fake traveling pass for an enslaved young man, Noah, with whom she was in love. She had been taught to read and write secretly by Missy Anne, the niece of the plantation owner. Her new owner, Thomas Lea (Moore in the 1977 miniseries), immediately raped her. He fathered her only child, whom he named George after his first slave (or after his own father, according to the 2016 miniseries). George spent his life with the tag &quot;Chicken George&quot;, because of his assigned duties of tending to his master&#x27;s cockfighting birds.

In the novel, Kizzy never learns her parents&#x27; fate. She spends the remainder of her life as a field hand on the Lea plantation in North Carolina. According to the 1977 miniseries, Kizzy is taken back to visit the Reynolds plantation later in life. She discovers that her mother was sold off to another plantation and that her father died of a broken heart two years later, in 1822. She finds his grave, on which she crosses out his slave name Toby and writes his real name Kunta Kinte instead. Kizzy is Haley&#x27;s only ancestor in the genealogy link to Kunta Kinte, who spent the majority of her life in slavery.

The latter part of the book tells of the generations between Kizzy and Alex Haley, describing their suffering, losses, and eventual triumphs in America. Alex Haley claimed to be a seventh-generation descendant of Kunta Kinte.

===Historical accuracy===

Haley claimed that his sources for the origins of Kinte were oral family tradition and a man he found in the Gambia named Kebba Kanga Fofana, who claimed to be a griot with knowledge about the Kinte clan. He described them as a family in which the men were blacksmiths, descended from a marabout named Kairaba Kunta Kinte, originally from Mauritania. Haley quoted Fofana as telling him: &quot;About the time the king&#x27;s soldiers came, the eldest of these four sons, Kunta, went away from this village to chop wood and was never seen again.&quot;

However, journalists and historians later discovered that Fofana was not a griot. In retelling the Kinte story, Fofana changed crucial details, including his father&#x27;s name, his brothers&#x27; names, his age, and even omitted the year when he went missing. At one point, he even placed Kunta Kinte in a generation that was alive in the twentieth century. It was also discovered that elders and griots could not give reliable genealogical lineages before the mid-19th century, with the single apparent exception of Kunta Kinte. It appears that Haley had told so many people about Kunta Kinte that he had created a case of circular reporting. Instead of independent confirmation of the Kunta Kinte story, he was actually hearing his own words repeated back to him.

After Haley&#x27;s book became nationally famous, American author Harold Courlander noted that the section describing Kinte&#x27;s life was apparently taken from Courlander&#x27;s own 1967 novel &quot;The African&quot;. Haley at first dismissed the charge, but later issued a public statement affirming that Courlander&#x27;s book had been the source, and Haley attributed the error to a mistake of one of his assistant researchers. Courlander sued Haley for copyright infringement, which Haley settled out of court.

However, despite the inconsistencies with Haley&#x27;s chronology, academics including historian John Thornton, director of the African American Studies program at Boston University, have noted that a person named Kunta Kinte could have lived in the Gambia in the 1700s and been enslaved.

==In popular culture==
Kunta Kinte has inspired a reggae riddim of the same name. This started off life as a track called &quot;Beware Of Your Enemies&quot; released from Jamaica&#x27;s Channel One. A dub version, put out in 1976 by Channel One house band The Revolutionaries became a sound system anthem for many years on dubplate, and inspired a UK version produced by Mad Professor in 1981. It has also inspired jungle covers.

There is an annual Kunta Kinte Heritage Festival held in Maryland.

In the 1987 song &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot;, an early milestone in his feud with fellow rapper LL Cool J, Kool Moe Dee states that his adversary must bow down to him or suffer Kunta Kinte&#x27;s punishment: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna ask him, &#x27;Who&#x27;s the best?&#x27; And if he don&#x27;t say, &#x27;Moe Dee&#x27;, I&#x27;ll take my whip and make him call himself Toby.&quot;

The 1988 comedy film &quot;Coming to America&quot; jokingly references Kunta Kinte, in an homage to &quot;Roots&quot; (John Amos, who played a supporting role in &quot;Coming to America&quot; as the father of the protagonist&#x27;s love interest, played the adult version of Kunta Kinte in the 1977 miniseries).

Ice Cube mentions Kunta Kinte in his 1991 song &quot;No Vaseline&quot; where he disses members of his former group N.W.A where he compares MC Ren to Kunta Kinte stating &quot;So don&#x27;t believe what Ren say. &#x27;Cause he&#x27;s goin&#x27; out like Kunte Kinte&quot;.

In &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; episode &quot;Will Gets a Job&quot; (Season 2, Episode 3), after uncle Phil (James Avery) tells him he can&#x27;t have hang out with his friends or watch TV, Will Smith (Will Smith) asks &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just do me like Kunta Kinte and cut off my foot?&quot;. The episode aired in April 1991.

Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s 2015 song &quot;King Kunta&quot; was inspired by the character. Afrikan Boy released a song called Mr. Kunta Kinte in 2016.

Athlete Colin Kaepernick wore a T-shirt with &quot;Kunta Kinte&quot; emblazoned on it to a controversial NFL workout. In CNN&#x27;s interpretation, &quot;Kaepernick appeared to use the reference to make a statement: He will not change who he is to appease the powers that be.&quot;

<text>The Residents Radio Special is an album released by The Residents in 1977. This cassette was a promotional item issued to radio stations shortly after the release of &quot;Fingerprince&quot;. It was soon offered through the mail-order service in limited quantities on cassette. The cassette was re-released in 1980 and 1984. A limited edition, entitled &quot;Eat Exuding Oinks!&quot;, was released in 2001, featuring the original radio show and the digitally remastered versions of the songs. A highlight is the first official release of the cover of The Mothers of Invention&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot;, with Snakefinger on guitar.

<doc id="951538" wikidata="Q56395" url="?curid=951538" title="Yola dialect">
<text>Yola, more commonly and historically the Forth and Bargy dialect, is an extinct dialect of the Middle English language once spoken in the baronies of Forth and Bargy in County Wexford, Ireland. As such, it was probably similar to the Fingallian dialect of the Fingal area. Both became functionally extinct in the 19th century when they were replaced by modern Hiberno-English. The word means in the dialect. In modern times, there have been efforts to revive the dialect. 
==History==
===Origins===
The dialect was spoken in County Wexford, particularly in the baronies of Forth and Bargy. This was the first area English speakers came to in the Norman invasion of Ireland, supporting the theory that it evolved from the Middle English introduced in that period. As such it is thought to have been similar to Fingallian, which was spoken in the Fingal region north of Dublin. Middle English, the mother tongue of the &quot;Old English&quot; community, was widespread throughout southeastern Ireland until the 14th century; as the Old English were increasingly assimilated into Irish culture, their original language was gradually displaced through Gaelicisation. After this point, Yola and Fingallian were the only attested relicts of this original form of English.

Modern English was widely introduced by British colonists during and after the 17th century, forming the basis for the modern Hiberno-English of Ireland. The new varieties were notably distinct from the surviving relict dialects. As English continued to spread, both Yola and Fingallian died out in the 19th century, though Yola continued to be used as a liturgical language by the churches of Wexford well into the 20th century. To this day the Kilmore Choir sings what were once Yola tunes, now adapted to Standard English.

The speech of Forth and Bargy was the only kind in Ireland included in Alexander John Ellis&#x27;s work &quot;On Early English Pronunciation Volume V&quot;, which was the earliest survey of dialects of English. The phonetics of the dialect were taken from a local reverend.

=== Use after the mid-19th century ===
Though the Forth and Bargy dialect ceased to be used as a means of daily communication after the mid-19th century, it continued to see significant usage as a liturgical language, and some personal usage within the linguist community of Ireland, such as Kathleen Browne&#x27;s letter to Ireland dated to 10 April 1893. Browne was a fluent Yola speaker and wrote a number of articles including &quot;The Ancient Dialect of the Baronies of Forth and Bargy&quot; in 1927.

County Wexford native Paddy Berry is noted for his condensed performances of the piece &quot;A Yola Zong&quot;, which he has performed for various recordings, the latest of which was in 2017. Various Yola rhymes, passed down from generation to generation, can be heard spoken by a Wexford woman in a documentary recorded in 1969 on the present usage and rememberers of Yola in the former baronies of Forth and Bargy.

Yola Farmstead, a community-operated reenactment of a Forth and Bargy village as it would have been during the 18th century, delivered a speech and performance of a song in Yola at their opening ceremony, featured Yola phrases in their advertisements, and hosted events where participants could learn some of the dialect from linguists and other experts on it. The Yola Farmstead also hosted a memorial event dedicated to Jack Devereux of the Kilmore Choir, which once used Yola extensively in their Christmas services. Devereux was a preservationist of, and well-versed in, Yola; locals considered him to be an expert on the dialect, and a rendition of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer translated into Yola was read at his memorial.

The Yola Farm has since closed down but since 2021 there have been efforts to reopen it. Wikitongues also has a section dedicated to Yola on its website which hosts language documentation and revitalization resources.

==Phonology==
As in the Dutch language, in southwestern varieties of English and (to a lesser extent) in German, most voiceless fricatives in Yola became voiced. The Middle English vowels are well-preserved, having only partially and sporadically undergone the changes associated with the Great Vowel Shift.

One striking characteristic of Yola was the fact that stress shifted to the second syllable of words in many instances: &quot;morsel&quot;, &quot;hatchet&quot;, &quot;dinner&quot;, &quot;reader&quot;, &quot;wedding&quot;, etc.

== Orthography ==

An exact spelling system for Yola has never been codified, beyond general trends listed in Jacob Poole&#x27;s writings. Most of the spellings are meant as comparisons to standard English ones of his day and the pronunciations are largely reconstructed. The following are listed here:
Note that the spellings can be somewhat inconsistent, due to many words attempting to draw comparison to English cognates and variation within the dialect. Not too much of the above, particularly regarding the vowels, is exactly certain.

==Grammar==

===Personal pronouns===
Yola pronouns were similar to Middle English pronouns.

===Articles===
The definite article was at first or , which was later replaced by .

===Verbs ===
Yola verbs had some conservative characteristics. The second and third person plural endings were sometimes or as in Chaucerian English. The past participle retained the Middle English &quot;y&quot; prefix as .

===Nouns===
Some nouns retained the plural of ME &quot;children&quot;, such as &#x27;bees&#x27; and &#x27;trees&#x27;.

==Vocabulary==
The glossary compiled by Jacob Poole provides most of what is known about the Forth and Bargy vocabulary. Poole was a farmer and member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from Growtown in the Parish of Taghmon on the border between the baronies of Bargy and Shelmalier. He collected words and phrases from his tenants and farm labourers between 1800 and his death in 1827.

Although most of its vocabulary is Old English in origin, Yola contains many borrowings from Irish and French.

All the Yola etymons are Middle English unless stated otherwise. Yola words derived from a non-standard Middle English form list the variant first, followed by the variant in parentheses.

===Interrogative words===
===Prepositions===
===Determiners===
===Other words===
===Cardinal numbers===
== Modern South Wexford English ==
Diarmaid Ó Muirithe travelled to South Wexford in 1978 to study the English spoken there. His informants ranged in age between 40 and 90. Among the long list of words still known or in use at that time are the following:
* : &#x27;going on amain&#x27; = getting on well
* : an unfriendly person
* : a little
* : threadbare
* : confusion, in a fash
* : to peep
* : to sunbathe, to relax in front of the fire
* : very, extremely
* : seaweed
Amain is a Norman word which means &#x27;of easy use&#x27;.

The following is a song in Yola with a rough translation into English.
===Address to Lord Lieutenant in 1836===

<text>Esztergom (; ; or ; , known by alternative names) is a city with county rights in northern Hungary, northwest of the capital Budapest. It lies in Komárom-Esztergom County, on the right bank of the river Danube, which forms the border with Slovakia there. Esztergom was the capital of Hungary from the 10th until the mid-13th century when King Béla IV of Hungary moved the royal seat to Buda.

Esztergom is the seat of the &quot;prímás&quot; (see Primate) of the Catholic Church in Hungary, and the former seat of the Constitutional Court of Hungary.
The city has a Christian Museum with the largest ecclesiastical collection in Hungary. Its cathedral, Esztergom Basilica, is the largest church in Hungary. Near the Basilica there is a campus of the Pázmány Péter Catholic University.

==Toponym ==
The Roman town was called &quot;Solva&quot;. The medieval Latin name was &quot;Strigonium&quot;. The first early medieval mention is &quot;ſtrigonensis [strigonensis] comes&quot; (1079–1080).

The first interpretation of the name was suggested by Antonio Bonfini. He tried to explain it from &quot;Istrogranum&quot;, &quot;city at the confluence of &quot;Ister&quot; (the Greek name of the Danube river) and &quot;Gran&quot; (the Latin name of the river Hron)&quot;. This interpretation is still popular. attempted to derive the name from Germanic languages. After the conquest of the country by Charlemagne, the Franks should give the name Osterringun to their easternmost castle; as a comparison, a reference is made to the town of Östringen. Pavel Jozef Šafárik tried to explain the name from Slavic &quot;ostřehu&quot; (). suggested a Slavic personal name &quot;Stigran&quot; without a deeper analysis of its origin.

In 1927, Konrad Schünemann summarized these older views and proposed the origin in a Slavic stem &quot;strěg&quot; (&quot;custodia&quot;, guard). This theory was later extended by Ján Stanislav who also explained the origin of the initial vowel missing in Latin and later Czech sources (&quot;Střehom&quot;). The introduction of a vowel before the initial consonant group is a regular change in the Hungarian language (&quot;Stephan&quot; → &quot;István&quot;, &quot;strecha&quot; → &quot;esztercha&quot;), but the initial &quot;O&quot; in later Slavic forms can be explained by an independent change–an incorrect decomposition of the Slavic prepositional form. Both authors noticed the high number of Slavic placenames in the region (Vyšegrad, Pleš, Kokot, Drug, Komárno, Toplica, etc.) and similar Slavic names in other countries (Strzegom, , Stregowa, etc.). Both authors believed that the stem &quot;strěg&quot; was a part of the Slavic personal name, but Šimon Ondruš suggests a straightforward etymology. The Proto-Slavic – to watch, to guard, present participle &quot;stregom&quot;, &quot;strägom&quot; – a guard post. The later Slavic form was created by an incorrect decomposition as follows: &quot;vъ Strägome&quot; (in Strägom) → &quot;vo Strägome&quot; → &quot;v Osträgome&quot; like Slovak &quot;Bdokovce&quot; → &quot;Obdokovce&quot;, &quot;Psolovce&quot; → &quot;Obsolovce&quot;.

 considered the name to be of uncertain origin, potentially derived also from Slavic (a tanner) or Proto-Bulgaric , – a leather armor. However, the last theory is sharply criticized by Šimon Ondruš as obsolete and unreliable, because of its dependency on later sources, the high number of Slavic names in the region and missing adoption of the word in the Hungarian language.

Other names of the town are Croatian &quot;Ostrogon&quot;, Polish &quot;Ostrzyhom&quot;, Serbian &quot;Ostrogon&quot; and &quot;Estergon&quot; (also Turkish), Slovak &quot;Ostrihom&quot; and Czech &quot;Ostřihom&quot; (the archaic name is &quot;Střehom&quot;). The German name is Gran (), like the German name of river Garam.

Right across the Danube on the Slovak side, there is a populated place of Štúrovo which in Hungarian is known as Párkány. The word Parkan in Belarusian, Polish, and Ukrainian languages is a common word for &quot;fenceline&quot;.

==History==






Esztergom is one of the oldest towns in Hungary. Esztergom, as it existed in the Middle Ages, now rests under today&#x27;s town. The results of the most recent archeological excavations reveal that the Várhegy (Castle Hill) and its vicinity have been inhabited since the end of the Ice Age 20,000 years ago. The first people known by name were the Celts from Western Europe, who settled in the region in about 350 BC. A flourishing Celtic settlement existed on the Varhegy until the region was conquered by Rome. Thereafter it became an important frontier town of Pannonia, known by the name of &quot;Salvio Mansio&quot;, &quot;Salvio&quot;, or Solva. By the seventh century the town was called &quot;Stregom&quot; and later &quot;Gran&quot;, but soon reverted to the former, which evolved into Esztergom by the thirteenth century. The German and Avar archaeological finds found in the area reveal that these people settled there following the period of the migrations that were caused by the fall of the Roman Empire.

At about 500 AD, Slavic peoples immigrated into the Pannonian Basin. In the 9th century, the territory was mostly under Frankish control, and it might have been part of Great Moravia too. In Old Slavonic language, it was called &quot;Strěgom&quot; (&quot;guard&quot;), as it was strategic point of control for the Danube valley.

The Magyars entered the Pannonian Basin in 896 AD and conquered it systematically, succeeding fully in 901. In 960, the ruling prince of the Hungarians, Géza, chose Esztergom as his residence. His son, Vajk, who was later called Saint Stephen of Hungary, was born in his palace built on the Roman castrum on the Várhegy (Castle Hill) around 969–975. In 973, Esztergom served as the starting point of an important historical event: during Easter of that year, Géza sent a committee to the international peace conference of Emperor Otto I in Quedlinburg. He offered peace to the Emperor and asked for missionaries.

The prince&#x27;s residence stood on the northern side of the hill. The center of the hill was occupied by a basilica dedicated to St. Adalbert, who, according to legend, baptised St. Stephen. The Church of St. Adalbert was the seat of the archbishop of Esztergom, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary. By that time, significant numbers of craftsmen and merchants had settled in the city.

Stephen&#x27;s coronation took place in Esztergom on either Christmas Day 1000 or January 1, 1001. From the time of his rule up to the beginning of the 13th century, the only mint for the country operated here. During the same period, the castle of Esztergom (&quot;Estergon Kalesi&quot; in Turkish) was built. It served not only as the royal residence until the Mongol siege of Esztergom in 1241 (during the first Mongol invasion), but also as the center of the Hungarian state, religion, and Esztergom county. The archbishop of Esztergom was the leader of the ten bishoprics founded by Stephen. The archbishop was often in charge of important state functions and had the exclusive right to crown kings.

The settlements of royal servants, merchants and craftsmen at the foot of the Várhegy (Castle Hill) developed into the most significant town during the age of the Árpád dynasty– these being the most important area of the economic life of the country. According to the Frenchman Odo of Deuil, who visited the country in 1147, &quot;the Danube carries the economy and treasures of several countries to Esztergom&quot;.

The town council was made up of the richest citizens of the town (residents of French, Spanish, Dutch, and Italian origin) who dealt with commerce. The coat of arms of Esztergom emerged from their seal in the 13th century. This was the town where foreign monarchs could meet Hungarian kings. For example, Emperor Conrad II met Géza II in this town (1147). Another important meeting took place when the German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa visited Béla III. The historians traveling with them all agree on the richness and significance of Esztergom. Arnold of Lübeck, the historian with Frederick Barbarossa, called Esztergom the capital of Hungarian people (&quot;quae Ungarorum est metropolis&quot;).

In the beginning of the 13th century, Esztergom was the center of the country&#x27;s political and economic life. This is explained by the canon of Nagyvárad, Rogerius of Apulia, who witnessed the first devastation of the country during the Tatar invasion siege of Esztergom and wrote in his Carmen Miserabile (&quot;Sad Song&quot;): &quot;since there was no other town like Esztergom in Hungary, the Tatars (siege of Esztergom) were considering crossing the Danube to pitch a camp there&quot;, which was exactly what happened after the Danube froze. The capital of the Árpád-age was destroyed in a vicious battle. Though, according to the documents that remained intact, some of the residents (those who escaped into the castle) survived and new residents settled in the area and soon started rebuilding the town, it lost its leading role. Béla IV gave the palace and castle to the archbishop, and changed his residence to Buda. Béla IV and his family, however, were buried in the Franciscan church in Esztergom which had been destroyed during the invasion and which had been rebuilt by Béla IV in 1270.

Following these events, the castle was built and decorated by the bishops. The center of the king&#x27;s town, which was surrounded by walls, was still under royal authority. A number of different monasteries did return or settle in the religious center.

Meanwhile, the citizenry had been fighting to maintain and reclaim the rights of towns against the expansion of the church within the royal town. In the chaotic years after the fall of the House of Árpád, Esztergom suffered another calamity: in 1304, the forces of Wenceslaus II, the Czech king occupied and raided the castle. In the years to come, the castle was owned by several individuals: Róbert Károly and then Louis the Great patronized the town. In 1327 Kovácsi, the most influential suburb of the town, lying in the southeast, was united with Esztergom. The former suburb had three churches with mainly blacksmith, goldsmith, and coiner residents.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, Esztergom saw events of great importance and became one of the most influential acropolises of Hungarian culture along with Buda. Their courts, which were similar to the royal courts of Buda and Visegrád, were visited by such kings, scientists, and artists as Louis the Great, Sigismund of Luxembourg, King Matthias Corvinus, Galeotto Marzio, Regiomontanus, the famous astronomer Marcin Bylica and Georg von Peuerbach, Pier Paolo Vergerio and Antonio Bonfini, King Matthias&#x27;s historian, who, in his work praises the constructive work of János Vitéz, King Matthias&#x27;s educator. He had a library and an observatory built next to the cathedral. As Bonfini wrote about his masterpiece, his palace and terraced gardens: &quot;he had a spacious room for knights built in the castle. In front of that, he built a wonderful loggia of red marble. In front of the room, he built the Chapel of Sibyls, whose walls were decorated with paintings of the sybils. On the walls of the knights&#x27; room, not only the likeness of all the kings could be found, but also the Scythian ancestors. He also had a double garden constructed, which was decorated with columns and a corridor above them. Between the two gardens, he built a round tower of red marble with several rooms and balconies. He had Saint Adalbert&#x27;s Basilica covered with glass tiles&quot;. King Matthias&#x27;s widow, Beatrix of Aragon, lived in the castle of Esztergom for ten years (1490–1500).

The time of the next resident, Archbishop Tamás Bakócz (d. 1521) gave the town significant monuments. In 1507 he had Italian architects build the Bakócz chapel, which is the earliest and most significant Renaissance building which has survived in Hungary. The altarpiece of the chapel was carved from white marble by Andrea Ferrucci, a sculptor from Fiesole in 1519.

The Ottoman conquest of Mohács in 1526 brought a decline to the previously flourishing Esztergom as well. In the Battle of Mohács, the archbishop of Esztergom died. In the period between 1526 and 1543, when two rival kings reigned in Hungary, Esztergom was besieged six times. At times it was the forces of Ferdinand I or John Zápolya, at other times the Ottomans attacked. Finally, in 1530, Ferdinand I occupied the castle. He put foreign mercenaries in the castle, and sent the chapter and the bishopric to Nagyszombat and Pozsony (that is why some of the treasury, the archives and the library survived).

In 1543, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent attacked the castle and captured it. The castle then remained under the Ottoman Empire.

Esztergom (as &quot;Estergon&quot;) became the centre of an Ottoman sanjak controlling several counties, and also a significant castle on the northwest border of the Ottoman Empire – the main clashing point to prevent attacks on the mining towns of the highlands, Vienna and Buda. In 1594, during the unsuccessful but devastating siege by the walls of the Víziváros, Bálint Balassa, the first Hungarian poet who gained European significance, died in action. The most devastating siege took place in 1595 when the castle was reclaimed by the troops of Count Karl von Mansfeld and Count Mátyás Cseszneky. The price that had to be paid, however, was high. Most of the buildings in the castle and the town that had been built in the Middle Ages were destroyed during this period, and there were only uninhabitable, smothered ruins to welcome the conquerors.

In 1605 the Ottomans regained control over the castle as well as the whole region again, maintaining their rule until 1683. Though the Ottomans were mainly engaged in building and fortifying the castle, they also built significant new buildings including mosques, minarets and baths. These structures, along with the contemporary buildings, were destroyed in the siege of 1683 resulting in the re-conquest of Esztergom - though some Turkish buildings prevailed up to the beginning of the 18th century. The last time the Ottoman forces attacked Esztergom was in 1685. During the following year Buda was conquered as well. During these battles János Bottyán, captain of the cavalry, later the legendary figure of the Rákóczi war of independence disappeared. All that had been rebuilt at the end of the century was destroyed and burnt down during Ferenc Rákóczi&#x27;s long lasting, but finally successful siege.

The destroyed territory was settled by Hungarian, Slovakian and German settlers. This was when the new national landscape developed. In the area where there had previously been 65 Hungarian villages, only 22 were rebuilt. Though the reconstructed town received its free royal rights, in size and significance it was only a shadow of its former self.

Handcrafts gained strength and in around 1730, there were 17 independent crafts operating in Esztergom. Wine-culture was also of major significance. This was also the period when the Baroque view of the downtown area and the Víziváros (Watertown) were developed. The old town&#x27;s main characteristic is the simplicity and moderateness of its citizen Baroque architecture. The most beautiful buildings can be found around the marketplace (Széchenyi square).

In 1761, the bishopric regained control over the castle, where they started the preliminary processes of the reconstruction of the new religious center: the middle of the Várhegy (Castle Hill), the remains of Saint Stephen and Saint Adalbert churches were carried away to provide room for the new cathedral.

Although the major construction work and the resettlement of the bishopric (1820) played a significant role in the town&#x27;s life, the pace of Esztergom&#x27;s development gradually slowed down, and work on the new Basilica came to a halt.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Esztergom gained significance owing to its cultural and educational institutions as well as to being an administrative capital. The town&#x27;s situation turned worse after the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, after which it became a border town and lost most of its previous territory.

This was also the place where the poet Mihály Babits spent his summers from 1924 to his death in 1941. The poet&#x27;s residence was one of the centers of the country&#x27;s literary life; he had a significant effect on intellectual life in Esztergom.

Esztergom had one of the oldest Jewish communities in Hungary. They had a place of worship here by 1050. King Charles I (Caroberto) gifted a plot to the community for a cemetery in 1326.

According to the 1910 census, 5.1% of the population were Jewish, while the 1941 census found a population of 1510 Jews. The community maintained an elementary school until 1944. Jewish shops were ordered to be closed on April 28, 1944, and a short-lived ghetto was set up on May 11. The former Jewish shops were handed over to non-Jews on June 9. The inmates of the ghetto were sent to Komárom in early June, then deported to Auschwitz on June 16, 1944. Two forced labor units, whose members were mainly Esztergom Jews, were executed &quot;en masse&quot; near Ágfalva, on the Austrian border in January 1945.

Soviet troops captured the town on December 26, 1944, but were pushed back by the Germans on January 6, 1945, who were finally ousted on March 21, 1945.

The Mária Valéria bridge, connecting Esztergom with the city of Štúrovo in Slovakia was rebuilt in 2001 with the support of the European Union. Originally it was inaugurated in 1895, but the retreating German troops destroyed it in 1944. A new thermal and wellness spa opened in November 2005.

==Architecture==

One of the most important events of the 1930s was the exploration and renovation of the remains of the palace of the Árpád period. This again put Esztergom in the center of attention. Following World War II, Esztergom was left behind as one of the most severely devastated towns. However, reconstruction slowly managed to erase the traces of the war, with two of Esztergom&#x27;s most vital characteristics gaining significance: due to its situation it was the cultural center of the area (more than 8,000 students were educated at its elementary, secondary schools and college ). On the other hand, as a result of the local industrial development it has become a vital basis for the Hungarian tool and machinery industry.

This town, with its spectacular scenery and numerous memorials, a witness of the struggles of Hungarian history, is popular mostly with tourists interested in the beauties of the past and art. However, the town seems to regain its role in the country&#x27;s politics, and its buildings and traditions revive.

===The castle and palace===
The winding streets of the town, with its church towers create a historical atmosphere. Below Esztergom Basilica, at the edge of the mountain stands the old walls and bastions – the remains of the castle of Esztergom. The remains of one section of the royal palace and castle that had been built during the Ottoman rule had been buried in the ground up until the 1930s.

Most parts of the palace were explored and restored in the period between 1934 and 1938, but even today there are archeological excavations in progress. Passing through the narrow stairs, alleys, under arches and gates built in Romanesque style, a part of the past seems to come to life. This part of the palace was built in the time of King Béla III. With his wife - the daughter of Louis VII - French architects arrived and constructed the late-Roman and early-Gothic building at the end of the 12th century.

The frescoes of the palace chapel date from the 12th-14th centuries, while on the walls of the mottes, some of the most beautiful paintings of the early Hungarian Renaissance can be admired (15th century). From the terrace of the palace one can admire the landscape of Esztergom. Under the terrace are the houses and churches of the Bishop-town section, or &quot;Víziváros&quot; (Watertown) and the Primate&#x27;s Palace. Opposite the palace is the Saint Thomas hill, and surrounded by the mountains and the Danube. The walls of the castle still stand on the northern part of the Basilica. From the northern one can admire the view of Párkány on the other side of the Danube as well as the Szentgyörgymező, the Danube valley, and the So-called &#x27;Víziváros&#x27; (Watertown) districts.

===Esztergom Basilica===

Those traveling to Esztergom today can admire the most monumental construction of Hungarian Classicism, the Basilica, which silently rules the landscape above the winding Danube, surrounded by mountains.

The building that might be considered the symbol of the town is the largest church in Hungary and was built according to the plans of Pál Kühnel, János Páckh and József Hild from 1822 to 1869. Ferenc Liszt wrote the Mass of Esztergom for this occasion. The classicist church is enormous: the height of the dome is ; it has giant arches and an enormous altar-piece by Michelangelo Grigoletti. On one side, in the Saint Stephen chapel, the glittering relics of Hungarian and other nations&#x27; saints and valuable jewellery can be seen. On the south side, the Bakócz Chapel, the only one that survived the Middle Ages, can be seen. The builders of the Basilica had disassembled this structure into 1600 pieces, and incorporated it into the new church in its original form.

The treasury houses many masterpieces of medieval goldsmith&#x27;s works. The western European masters&#x27; hands are praised by such items as the crown silver cross that has been used since the 13th century, the ornate chalices, Francesco Francia&#x27;s processional cross, the upper part of the well-known &#x27;Matthias-Calvary&#x27; which is decorated in the rare ronde-bosse enamel technique. The Treasury also has a vast collection of traditional Hungarian and European textiles, including chasubles, liturgical vestments and robes.

The sound of the enormous bell hung in the southern tower can be heard from kilometers away. From the top of the large dome, visitors can see a breath-taking view: to the north, east and south the ranges of the Börzsöny, Visegrád, Pilis and Gerecse mountains rule the landscape, while to the west, in the valley of the Danube one can see as far as the Small Plains.

===Viziváros===
The Víziváros (Watertown) section was named after being built on the banks of the Kis- and Nagy Duna (Small and Great Danube). Its fortresses, walls, bastions and Turkish can still be seen by the walk on the banks of the Danube. By the northern end of the wall, on the bank of the Nagy-Duna, an interesting memorial is put, a stone table with Ottoman Turkish writings commemorates Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent&#x27;s victorious siege of 1543. The narrow, winding streets within the walls hide the remains of Turkish mosques and baths.

Along the delightful streets of the Víziváros (Watertown), surrounded by Baroque and Classicist buildings stands the Primate&#x27;s Palace, designed by József Lippert (1880–82). The Keresztény Múzeum (Christian museum), founded by Archbishop János Simor, is located in this building. It houses a rich collection of Hungarian panel pictures and sculpture of the Middle Ages as well as Italian and western-European paintings and handicrafts (13th-18th centuries). This is where one can admire the chapel-like structure of the late Gothic &#x27;Úrkoporsó&#x27; (Lord&#x27;s coffin) from Garamszentbenedek that is decorated by painted wooden sculptures (), the winged altar-piece by Thomas of Coloswar (1427), paintings by Master M.S. (1506), the gothic altars from Upper Historical Hungary (Felvidék), handicrafts of Italian, German and Flemish artists from the 13th–17th centuries, tapestries and ceramics.

The building of the Balassa Bálint Museum that was built in Baroque style on medieval bases and is located in Víziváros (Watertown), served as the first town hall of Esztergom county after the Turks had been driven out of the region.

The parish-church in the centre of the Víziváros (Watertown), which was built by the Jesuits between 1728 and 1738, and the single-towered Franciscan churches are also masterpieces of Baroque architecture.

===Cathedral Library===
The Cathedral Library standing in the southern part of the town, which was built in 1853 according to plans by József Hild is one of the richest religious libraries of Hungary, accommodating approximately 250,000 books, among which several codices and incunabula can be found, such as the Latin explanation of the &#x27;Song of Songs&#x27; from the 12th century, the &#x27;Lövöföldi Corvina&#x27; originating from donations of King Matthias, or the , which includes the Hungarian translation of the Bible from 1516 to 1519. Along with Bakócz and Ulászló graduals, they conserve also the Balassa Bible, in which Balassa&#x27;s uncle, Balassa András wrote down the circumstances of his birth and death.

===Szent Tamás-hegy===
The main sight of the nearby &#x27;Szent Tamás-hegy&#x27; (Saint Thomas Hill - Szenttamás) is the Baroque Calvary, with the Classicist chapel on the top of the hill, which was built to commemorate the heroes who died for Esztergom. The hill was named after a church built by Bishop Lukács Bánffy in memoriam the martyr Saint Thomas Becket, who had been his fellow student at the University of Paris. The church and the small castle which the Turks built there were destroyed a long time ago. On its original spot, the top of the hill, the narrow winding streets and small houses that were built by the masters who were working on the construction of the Basilica at the beginning of the previous century, have an atmosphere that is similar to that of Tabán in Buda. At the foot of the hill are the swimming pool and the Classicist building of the Fürdő Szálló (Bath Hotel). This is where Lajos Kossuth stayed in 1848 on one of his recruiting tours.

On the southern slopes of the hill there is a Mediterranean, winding path with stairs that lead to the Baroque Saint Stephen chapel.

===Széchényi Square and the Town Hall===
The main square of the town is the Széchényi square. Of the several buildings of Baroque, Rococo and Classicist style, there is one that catches everyone&#x27;s eyes: the Town Hall. Originally, it used to be the single-floor curia of Vak Bottyán (János Bottyán, Bottyán the Blind), the Kuruc general (1689). The first floor was constructed on its top in 1729. The house burnt down in the 1750s. It was rebuilt in accordance with the plans of a local architect, Antal Hartmann. Upon its façade there is a red marble carving which presents the coat of arms of Esztergom (a palace within the castle walls, protected by towers, with the Árpáds&#x27; shields below.) On the corner of the building the equestrian statue of Vak Bottyán (created by István Martsa) commemorates the original owner of the house.

The Trinity-statue in the middle of the square was created by György Kiss in 1900. In Bottyán János Street, near the Town Hall, there are well decorated Baroque houses. This is where the Franciscan church is located (built between 1700 and 1755). Opposite this building there is a Baroque palace which used to belong to the Sándor Earl family.

===Other churches===
In the direction of the Kis Duna, the downtown parish-church, built by the architect Ignác Oratsek can be admired. A bit farther is the Classicist Church of Saint Anne. The orthodox church at 60 Kossuth Lajos street was built around 1770 by Serbian settlers in Esztergom.

==Demographics==

===Languages and ethnic groups===

The city and the neighbouring territories became devastated due to the Ottoman wars. Esztergom was repopulated by mostly ethnic Hungarians, some Germans and Slovaks in the late 17th and the early 18th centuries. According to András Vályi, the population of Esztergom was mostly Hungarian in 1796, and the German and Slovak minorities were conversant with the Hungarian language. Elek Fényes described Esztergom as mostly Hungarian by language in 1851.
Based on the 1880 census, the city (with Szentgyörgymező, Szenttamás and Víziváros) had 14,944 inhabitants, of whom there were 13,340 (89.3%) Hungarians, 755 (5.1%) Germans and 321 (2.1%) Slovaks by native language.

According to the 2011 census the total population of Esztergom was 28,926, of whom there were 24,155 (83.5%) Hungarians, 729 (2.5%) Romani, 527 (1.8%) Germans and 242 (0.8%) Slovaks by ethnicity. 13.6% of the total population did not declare their ethnicity. In Hungary people can declare multiple ethnic backgrounds, so other people declared Hungarian and a minority one together.

===Religion===

Historically, Esztergom has been the seat of the Catholic Church in Hungary and the privilege of 1708 banned non-Catholics from the city (excluding the small Serbian Orthodox minority). Thus, the population was almost exclusively Roman Catholic in 1851.

The 1869 census showed 14,512 people (with Szentgyörgymező, Szenttamás and Víziváros), 13,567 (93.5%) Roman Catholic, 718 (4.9%) Jewish, 130 (0.9%) Hungarian Reformed (Calvinist), 68 (0.5%) Lutheran and 27 (0.2%) Eastern Orthodox.

At the 2011 census, there were 13,127 (45.4%) Roman Catholic, 1,647 (5.7%) Hungarian Reformed, 211 (0.7%) Lutheran and 160 (0.6%) Greek Catholic. 3,807 people (13.2%) were irreligious and 418 (1.5%) Atheist, while 9,046 people (31.3%) did not declare their religion.
==Industry==
The Magyar Suzuki Corporation plant opened in 1992, as the European base of the Japanese automotive manufacturer Suzuki. It has a production capacity of 300,000 vehicles per year and it is the biggest employing company in the city, with 2,682 employees (statistical average 2022).

<text>The Mole Show Live in Holland is a live album by the band The Residents, released in 1989. This is the most easily accessible version of the Mole Show and it was presented live, complete with narration by Penn Jillette. There are others (a picture disc release of a show at The Roxy, for instance) but, for sound quality and a good idea of how the presentation went, look no further. Excerpts from this show were also videotaped and released on video in 1984 along with &quot;Whatever Happened to Vileness Fats?&quot;.

<doc id="951548" wikidata="Q11328810" url="?curid=951548" title="Pascack Valley Line">
<text>The Pascack Valley Line is a commuter rail line operated by the Hoboken Division of New Jersey Transit, in the U.S. states of New Jersey and New York. The line runs north from Hoboken Terminal, through Hudson and Bergen counties in New Jersey, and into Rockland County, New York, terminating at Spring Valley. Service within New York is operated under contract with Metro-North Railroad. The line is named for the Pascack Valley region that it passes through in northern Bergen County. The line parallels the Pascack Brook for some distance. The line is colored purple on system maps, and its symbol is a pine tree.

==Description==

The Pascack Valley Line runs between Spring Valley, New York, and Hoboken Terminal. The line is long, of which the northernmost are in New York State. The entire line is owned by NJ Transit, but the Pearl River, Nanuet and Spring Valley stations are leased to Metro-North Railroad. The line is single tracked, but sidings at points along the line, including the Meadowlands, Hackensack and Nanuet, permit bi-directional off-peak service. A siding in Oradell was also planned for increased service and reliability, but the project was halted due to local opposition. Service on this line operates seven days a week.

==History==

The line was originally chartered as the Hackensack and New York Railroad in 1856. It later became the New Jersey and New York Railroad, which was bought by the Erie Railroad in 1896. The New Jersey and New York Railroad continued to exist as an Erie subsidiary until October 17, 1960 merger that created the Erie Lackawanna Railroad.

On April 1, 1976 the Erie Lackawanna was merged with several other railroads to create Conrail. In 1983, after several years under operation by Conrail, operations of the Pascack Valley Line were transferred to NJ Transit Rail Operations.

The line used to continue north of Spring Valley to Haverstraw, New York. This portion of the line has been abandoned and most of the right-of-way has been sold off. Part of the line (between Spring Valley and Nanuet) was once part of the main Erie Railroad line from Piermont, New York to Buffalo, New York. Into the 1930s there had been Erie passenger service from Spring Valley at the end of the Pascack line to Suffern station on the newer Erie Main Line. By 1941, this was reduced to a single weekday trip in each direction.

In August 2020, amidst the financial repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that it would shut down service on the line in Rockland County if federal bailout money were not available.

==September 2016 crash==

On September 29, 2016, Pascack Valley Line Train 1614 crashed into Hoboken Terminal injuring 108 and killing one.

<doc id="951561" wikidata="Q3086752" url="?curid=951561" title="Freak Show/Freak Show Soundtrack">
<text>Freak Show is a studio album by American art rock band The Residents, released in 1990. It marked the beginning of The Residents&#x27; obsession with emerging computer technology in the 1990s, and much of the music was made with various MIDI devices.

The interactive &quot;Freak Show&quot; CD-ROM was released in 1994. A &quot;Freak Show&quot; stage performance by a theater company at the Archa Theater in Prague premiered on November 1, 1995. Kyle Baker worked on a graphic novel, &quot;The Residents: Freak Show&quot;, which was released in 1992 by Dark Horse.

Several of the songs were also performed live during the 1997 25th anniversary concerts at the Fillmore in San Francisco. After the CD-ROM&#x27;s success, the album was re-released as The Freak Show Soundtrack with a different cover. A limited edition, The Freak Show Special Edition, was released in 2002 to mark the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album &quot;relatively accessible&quot; as well as &quot;often unnerving,&quot; writing that &quot;there are more than enough lyrical twists and turns to avoid mere gross-out overkill, and the music shifts textures and tempos ... to follow suit.&quot;

<doc id="951569" wikidata="Q11903425" url="?curid=951569" title="Virulent Newcastle disease">
<text>Virulent Newcastle disease (VND), formerly exotic Newcastle disease, is a contagious viral avian disease affecting many domestic and wild bird species; it is transmissible to humans. Though it can infect humans, most cases are non-symptomatic; rarely it can cause a mild fever and influenza-like symptoms and/or conjunctivitis in humans. Its effects are most notable in domestic poultry due to their high susceptibility and the potential for severe impacts of an epizootic on the poultry industries. It is endemic to many countries. No treatment for VND is known, but the use of prophylactic vaccines and sanitary measures reduces the likelihood of outbreaks.

The disease is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avulavirus. Strains of Newcastle disease virus have been used to treat cancer in humans, since the virus appears to preferentially infect and kill cancerous cells. Strains of Newcastle disease virus have also been used to create viral vector vaccine candidates against Ebola and COVID-19.

==History==

Newcastle disease was first identified in Java, Indonesia, in 1926, and in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 1927. However, it may have been prevalent as early as 1898, when a disease wiped out all the domestic fowl in northwest Scotland.

The policy of slaughter ceased in England and Wales on 31 March 1963, except for the peracute form of Newcastle disease and for fowl plague. In Scotland the slaughter policy continued for all types of fowl pest.

Interest in the use of NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from the ability of NDV to selectively kill human tumour cells with limited toxicity to normal cells.

Since May 2018, California Department of Food and Agriculture staff and the United States Department of Agriculture have been working on eliminating VND in South California and more than 400 birds have been confirmed to have VND. On February 27, 2019, the California state veterinarian, Annette Jones, increased the quarantine area in Southern California and on March 15, 2019, and April 5, 2019, cases of VND in Northern California and Arizona respectively.

==Causal agent==

The causal agent, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is a variant of &quot;avian orthoavulavirus 1&quot;, a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. NDV belongs to the subfamily &quot;Avulavirinae&quot;, which infect birds. Transmission occurs by exposure to faecal and other excretions from infected birds, and through contact with contaminated food, water, equipment, and clothing.

===Strains===
NDV strains can be categorised as velogenic (highly virulent), mesogenic (intermediate virulence), or lentogenic (nonvirulent). Velogenic strains produce severe nervous and respiratory signs, spread rapidly, and cause up to 90% mortality. Mesogenic strains cause coughing, affect egg quality and production, and result in up to 10% mortality. Lentogenic strains produce mild signs with negligible mortality.

== Transmission ==
NDV is spread primarily through direct contact between healthy birds and the bodily discharges of infected birds. The disease is transmitted through infected birds&#x27; droppings and secretions from the nose, mouth, and eyes. NDV spreads rapidly among birds kept in confinement, such as commercially raised chickens.

High concentrations of the NDV are found in birds&#x27; bodily discharges; therefore, the disease can be spread easily by mechanical means. Virus-bearing material can be picked up on shoes and clothing and carried from an infected flock to a healthy one.

NDV can survive for several weeks in a warm and humid environment on birds&#x27; feathers, manure, and other materials. It can survive indefinitely in frozen material. However, the virus is destroyed rapidly by dehydration and by the ultraviolet rays in sunlight.
Smuggled pet birds, especially Amazon parrots from Latin America, pose a great risk of introducing NDV into the US. Amazon parrots are carriers of the disease, but do not show symptoms, and are capable of shedding NDV for more than 400 days.

== Clinical findings ==

=== Clinical signs ===

Signs of infection with NDV vary greatly depending on factors such as the strain of virus and the health, age and species of the host.

The incubation period for the disease ranges from 2 to 15 days. An infected bird may exhibit several signs, including respiratory signs (gasping, coughing), nervous signs (depression, inappetence, muscular tremors, drooping wings, twisting of head and neck, circling, complete paralysis), swelling of the tissues around the eyes and neck, greenish, watery diarrhoea, misshapen, rough- or thin-shelled eggs and reduced egg production.

In acute cases, the death is very sudden, and, in the beginning of the outbreak, the remaining birds do not seem to be sick. In flocks with good immunity, however, the signs (respiratory and digestive) are mild and progressive, and are followed after seven days by nervous symptoms, especially twisted heads.

=== Postmortem lesions ===
Petechiae in the proventriculus and on the submucosae of the gizzard are typical; also, severe enteritis of the duodenum occurs. The lesions are scarce in hyperacute cases (first day of outbreak).

== Diagnosis ==

=== Immunological tests ===
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, and sequence technology tests have been developed.

== Virus isolation ==

=== Samples ===
For routine isolation of NDV from chickens, turkeys, and other birds, samples are obtained by swabbing the trachea and the cloaca. Cotton swabs can be used. The virus can also be isolated from the lungs, brain, spleen, liver, and kidneys.

=== Handling ===
Prior to shipping, samples should be stored at 4 °C (refrigerator). Samples must be shipped in a padded envelope or box. Samples may be sent by regular mail, but overnight is recommended.

== Prevention ==
Any animals showing symptoms of Newcastle disease should be isolated immediately. New birds should also be vaccinated before being introduced to a flock. An inactivated viral vaccine is available, as well as various combination vaccines. A thermotolerant vaccine is available for controlling Newcastle disease in underdeveloped countries. Schiappacasse et al. 2020 demonstrates successful, complete inactivation of the virus in a space using a nonthermal plasma generator.

==History of NDV in cancer research==
Though the oncolytic effect of NDV was already documented in the 1950s, later advances in research into using viruses in cancer therapy came with the advent of reverse genetics technologies. Later on it was Csatary LK and his colleagues to document anti-cancer effects in patients with brain gliomas.

One of the main issues using NDV would be the host/patient immune response against the virus itself, which prior to the time of the reverse genetics technology, decreased the potential applicability of NDV as a cancer treatment.

 there had been several clinical studies into the use of NDV for cancer treatment, but the research quality was low and the outcomes inconclusive.

<doc id="951578" wikidata="Q1594437" url="?curid=951578" title="Nightlife">
<text>Nightlife is a collective term for entertainment that is available and generally more popular from the late evening into the early hours of the morning. It includes pubs, bars, nightclubs, parties, live music, concerts, cabarets, theatre, cinemas, and shows. These venues often require a cover charge for admission. Nightlife entertainment is often more adult-oriented than daytime entertainment. People who prefer to be active during the night-time are called night owls.

==History==
The lack of electric lighting, as well as the needs for agricultural labor, made staying up after dark difficult for most people. Larger ancient cities, such as Rome, had a reputation for danger at night. This changed in 17th and 18th-century Europe (and subsequently spread beyond) due to the development and implementation of artificial lighting: more domestic lights, added street lighting, and adaptation by the royal and upper social classes. The introduction of chocolate, coffee and tea, and cafes that stayed open through dawn, became part of the new culture.

== Sociological research ==

Nightlife has been a vibrant area of research for sociologists. Nightlife establishments including pubs, bars, and nightclubs function as third places, according to Ray Oldenburg in &quot;The Great Good Place&quot;.

Some sociologists have argued that vibrant city nightlife scenes contribute to the development of culture as well as political movements. David Grazian cites as examples the development of beat poetry, musical styles including bebop, urban blues and early rock, and the importance of nightlife for the development of the gay rights movement in the United States kicked off by the riots at the Stonewall Inn nightclub in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, New York City.

There is debate about the degree to which nightlife contributes positively to social capital and the public goods of society. David Grazian points out that nightlife can &quot;replicate the same structures of race, ethnic, and class inequality and exclusion found in the larger society.&quot;

Grazian cites the use of dress codes by some nightlife establishments in the United States—mostly nightclubs—that specifically targets clothing popularized by hip hop culture represents a form of informal discrimination and segregation on racial grounds. He also noted that nightclubs and club culture can create an environment that encourage or tolerate the &quot;harassment and degradation of women,&quot; citing the expectation that both female workers and patrons of bars and nightclubs engage in highly sexualized performances of femininity including dressing in a particularly sexual manner in order to gain entrance to clubs.
== Modernity impact ==
The supervisioned use of lighting in contrast to daylight, is correlated with human control over the use of technology. Research conducted by Euromonitor International indicates a growing demand for unique, immersive nightlife experiences among millennials and zoomers. Moreover, advancements in digital platforms and social media have reshaped how people discover and engage with nightlife, amplifying its influence and reach. As cities continue to embrace innovation and diversity, the nightlife procure remains a dynamic expression of modernity&#x27;s ever-evolving spirit. The evolve in urban landscape reflects in the nightlife customs through the zeitgeists of contemporary society.

== Regulation ==
=== Australia ===
Nightlife venues must be licensed to serve alcohol.

=== United Kingdom ===
Nightlife venues must be licensed to serve alcohol under the Licensing Act 2003 (and the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 in Scotland). Venues with door security (&quot;bouncers&quot;) are also required to ensure that the security staff are licensed by the Security Industry Authority.

Since the introduction of the Licensing Act 2003, pubs and bars have been able to apply to operate until later. For nightclubs, this has become a form of competition as patrons can stay in the same pub or bar rather than move on to a club.

=== United States ===
In the United States, legislation affecting nightlife is handled primarily at state and local levels.

<doc id="951581" wikidata="Q4385693" url="?curid=951581" title="Trial of Michael Jackson">
<text>People v. Jackson (full title: &quot;1133603: The People of the State of California v. Michael Joe Jackson&quot;) was a 2005 criminal trial held in Santa Barbara County Superior Court in Santa Maria, California. The American pop singer Michael Jackson was charged with molesting Gavin Arvizo, who was 13 years old at the time of the alleged abuse, at his Neverland Ranch estate in Los Olivos, California.

Jackson was first accused of child sexual abuse in 1993; he denied the allegations and settled in a civil lawsuit. In 2003, the documentary &quot;Living with Michael Jackson&quot; showed Jackson holding hands with Arvizo and defending his practice of giving his bed to children, triggering an investigation. Jackson was indicted on four counts of molesting a minor, four counts of intoxicating a minor to molest him, one count of attempted child molestation, one count of conspiring to hold Gavin and his family captive, and conspiring to commit extortion and child abduction.

The trial spanned approximately four months, beginning with jury selection that began on January 31, 2005. Gavin and his brother testified that Jackson had given them alcohol, showed them pornography, masturbated before them, and made sexual advances. The defense characterized the witnesses for the prosecution as disgruntled ex-employees or individuals seeking to exploit Jackson for money. Witnesses for the defense included testimony from celebrities including the former child actor Macaulay Culkin and the comedian Chris Tucker. Coverage of the trial was described as a media circus, and many media outlets were quick to portray Jackson as guilty.

Jackson was acquitted on all counts on June 13, 2005. He never returned to Neverland Ranch, and spent the first several months after the trial living abroad in Bahrain and Ireland. In 2013, four years after Jackson&#x27;s death, one of the defense witnesses, Wade Robson, changed his position and filed a lawsuit, saying he had been abused by Jackson.

==Background==

In 1993, Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler. The abuse allegedly took place at Jackson&#x27;s Neverland Ranch home in Santa Barbara, California. In January 1994, Jackson settled the lawsuit made against him for $23 million, with $5 million going to the family&#x27;s lawyers. The settlement was not an admission of guilt; Jackson said he had settled to prevent the lawsuit interfering with his career, which he later regretted. Prosecutors pursued the criminal case and presented the evidence to two separate grand juries, neither of which indicted.

In 2000, the child cancer patient Gavin Arvizo was introduced to Jackson by the businessman and comedian Jamie Masada. Gavin&#x27;s father, David Arvizo, who was separated from Arvizo&#x27;s mother, often asked celebrities for money to support his son&#x27;s cancer treatments. Gavin was receiving chemotherapy and required the removal of his spleen and left kidney. Jackson and Gavin became friends, and Jackson invited Gavin and his family to Neverland Ranch. Gavin thanked Jackson for &quot;helping [him] be happy and beat cancer&quot;. According to Gavin, after a few visits to Neverland, Jackson suddenly stopped calling him; Gavin said he felt abandoned.

In 2002, Jackson invited Gavin, now 12 years old, to be a part of an ITV documentary, &quot;Living with Michael Jackson&quot;. The presenter, Martin Bashir, interviewed Jackson over eight months for the film. Jackson and Gavin were seen holding hands. Bashir asked Jackson about the appropriateness of a grown man having sleepovers and sharing a bed with a young person. Jackson said he allowed guests to sleep in his bed alone while he slept on the floor, and that it was not sexual. He said it was a &quot;beautiful thing&quot;, and that he had shared his bed with many children, including the actors Macaulay and Kieran Culkin. 

The documentary drew controversy and calls for Jackson&#x27;s children to be removed from his custody. Jackson called the documentary deceptive and a &quot;gross distortion of the truth&quot;. Gavin&#x27;s mother, Janet Arvizo, said it misrepresented her son&#x27;s relationship with Jackson; she instructed Theodore Goddard, the London law firm, to file complaints against the Independent Television Commission, which oversees ITV. Bashir defended his interview, saying: &quot;Here&#x27;s an individual who is 44 years old, sleeping in the bed of children who have no biological relationship with him. I did not set out to ensnare him with a child.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s production team recorded a two-hour rebuttal film, &quot;The Michael Jackson Interview: The Footage You Were Never Meant to See&quot;, which was screened by Fox Television. Jackson decided to release the film after feeling betrayed by Bashir. Macaulay Culkin appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; to defend Jackson, saying nothing inappropriate had occurred at Neverland Ranch. He said: &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s bedroom is two stories and has three bathrooms. When I slept in his bedroom, you have to understand the whole scenario. The thing is that, with Michael, he isn&#x27;t very good at explaining himself.&quot;

Gloria Gruber, president of Prevent Child Abuse California, called for authorities to interview the children with whom he had shared his bed, saying: &quot;The fact that he sleeps with children who are unrelated to him is definitely a red flag and concern.&quot; Santa Barbara district attorney Tom Sneddon, who had attempted to bring Jackson to trial over the 1993 allegations, initially said that, under Californian law, sleeping with a child without &quot;affirmative, offensive conduct&quot; was not illegal, and &quot;sleeping in bed with a kid is not a crime that I know of&quot;.

== Investigation and arrest ==

From February 14 to February 27, 2003, a few weeks after the broadcast of the documentary, the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services conducted a preliminary investigation of Jackson and Gavin. In a confidential report based on interviews with the Arvizos, which leaked to the media, child welfare officials stated that they believed that accusations of illicit conduct were unfounded.

In June 2003, Sneddon reopened the investigation. In July and August, he interviewed Gavin along with his father David, mother Janet, and younger brother Star. In November, Gavin told police that Jackson had molested him several times between February 7 and March 10, 2003, when, according to Janet, Jackson had held the family captive at Neverland. This timeline was revised in the grand jury indictment, which stated that the alleged acts of molestation occurred between February 21 and March 12, 2003.

On November 18, 2003, police searched Neverland Ranch with a search warrant. Jackson and his three children were in Las Vegas, where Jackson was shooting a music video for his single &quot;One More Chance&quot;. Jackson was arrested on November 20. He was released an hour later after posting a $3 million bond.

Shortly after the arrest, Jackson issued a statement saying the claims were &quot;predicated on a big lie&quot;. In an interview with the news program &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; Jackson said the police had mistreated him and complained of a dislocated shoulder. He reaffirmed his innocence and said that he was determined not to settle out of court as he had done in 1993. In August 2004, the California attorney general&#x27;s office concluded, after an independent investigation, that Jackson was neither &quot;manhandled&quot; nor mistreated when he was taken into custody.

On December 18, 2003, Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent for the purpose of committing a felony. On January 16, 2004, the day of his arraignment, Jackson climbed on top of his car to dance and wave to fans. On April 21, a grand jury indicted Jackson on several additional related charges, including conspiracy involving child abduction, false imprisonment, and extortion. Jackson pleaded not guilty on April 30. He faced a sentence of up to 18 years in prison if convicted at trial.

==Trial==

The trial began on February 28, 2005 in the courthouse of Santa Maria, Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara County Judge Rodney Melville presided over the trial. Melville, who had a contentious relationship with the news media, banned cameras from the courtroom and put a gag order on both sides. He delayed the three-day jury selection process for a week while Jackson was hospitalized, reportedly with flu.

Sneddon led the prosecution. Jackson&#x27;s legal team attempted to have him and his staff disqualified from the trial, citing bias following his attempts to prosecute Jackson in 1993; Melville dismissed the attempts. The defense was led by the celebrity lawyer Thomas Mesereau.

Melville allowed prosecutors to introduce testimony about past allegations against Jackson, including the 1993 case, to establish whether Jackson had a propensity to commit such crimes. The prosecution hoped to show that Jackson had engaged in a pattern of sexual abuse with boys. They called on witnesses to describe earlier incidents, including Jackson&#x27;s alleged 1993 abuse of Jordan Chandler. The prosecution argued that Jackson used Neverland, his &quot;fantasy hideaway&quot; with candy and theme park attractions, to lure boys and groom them into sex, and flattered their parents with gifts. The prosecution also said that, after &quot;Living With Michael Jackson&quot; aired, Jackson and his entourage had attempted to hold the Arvizo family virtually captive at Neverland and force them to participate in a rebuttal film.

On March 10, as Gavin Arvizo was about to testify, Jackson was absent from court. Judge Melville issued a warrant for his arrest and said Jackson&#x27;s $3 million bond would be forfeited if he did not arrive within an hour. Jackson arrived an hour and ten minutes late and appeared to weep in court. In an interview shortly afterwards, he said he had slipped in the shower and bruised his lung &quot;very badly&quot;. He said the ongoing trial had been the lowest period in his life, and denied rumors about his financial problems, saying they were part of a smear campaign.

=== Witnesses for the prosecution ===

==== Martin Bashir ====
On March 1, the British journalist Martin Bashir, who had interviewed Jackson for &quot;Living with Michael Jackson&quot;, took to the witness stand while prosecutors showed the documentary to jurors. Bashir refused to answer questions from defense attorneys.

==== Jason Francia ====
On April 4, Jason Francia, whose mother worked as a maid at Neverland Ranch, testified that Jackson had abused him on several occasions when he was seven to ten years old. Francia said that &quot;every time I was being tickled there was some sort of exchange of money&quot;, done with the understanding that he would not tell his mother. His mother said she had reached an out-of-court settlement with Jackson, reportedly for $2 million. She sold her stories to the tabloid &quot;National&quot; &quot;Enquirer&quot; and the television show &quot;Hard Copy&quot;.

On cross-examination, Francia acknowledged that in his first 1993 interview he told detectives Jackson had not molested him. He said he had denied being improperly touched by Jackson because he did not want to be embarrassed at school. He said he went into counseling until he was eighteen years old. Mesereau sought to establish that the Francias were goaded into their accusations by overzealous prosecutors and tempted by money offered for media interviews.

==== Neverland Ranch staff ====
In April 2005, Ralph Chacon, a former security guard at Neverland Ranch, testified that he had seen Jackson performing oral sex on Chandler in the early 1990s. Chacon also described seeing Jackson passionately kiss Chandler and place his hand on Chandler&#x27;s crotch. Chacon said that he did not report the incident to police because he thought he would not be believed. A former maid at the ranch, Adrian McManus, testified that she had seen Jackson kissing boys including the actor Macaulay Culkin, and described Jackson touching Culkin&#x27;s leg and rear. She told the court that she had seen Jackson touching Chandler&#x27;s genitals. Culkin, however, had always denied being sexually abused by Jackson.

The defense sought to portray Chacon and McManus as incredible witnesses. According to &quot;The Observer,&quot; each witness had a &quot;horrific story ... Yet, rather than calling the police, each appears to have sold that story to a supermarket tabloid.&quot; McManus had previously denied witnessing misconduct from Jackson in a 1993 court deposition while under oath. In the 2005 trial, she said she had lied during the deposition because she feared that Jackson would report her to her superiors if she told police about the incident. In the 1990s, Chacon and McManus had been part of a lawsuit filed against Jackson for wrongful dismissal. After Jackson counter-sued, their lawsuit was thrown out as fraudulent and malicious. According to testimony, Chacon and McManus had been found guilty of stealing items from Jackson&#x27;s house amounting to more than $50,000 and ordered to pay more than $1 million in legal fees. On cross-examination, the pair affirmed that they had been paid for media interviews. McManus also acknowledged that she and her husband were found to have previously defrauded a relative&#x27;s children and had stolen a sketch by Jackson worth $35,000. Mesereau accused the pair of attempting to &quot;get even&quot; with Jackson for the failed suit and characterized them as money-seekers.

Housekeeper Kiki Fournier testified that the Arvizo children became unruly at Neverland Ranch without authority figures. She said that the Arvizo boys &quot;trashed&quot; their guest rooms, and that at one point Star had pointed a knife at her in Jackson&#x27;s kitchen. She said that although the boys had guest rooms they would often stay with Jackson. However, she said she never saw Jackson giving the boys alcohol and never saw them drunk.

Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant who had served Jackson, testified that she never saw him share his drink with Gavin. She said she had devised the custom of serving Jackson wine in soda cans because Jackson did not like to openly drink alcohol in front of his children. Bell said she had not seen Jackson &quot;cuddling&quot; with Gavin during the flight, but testified that she had seen Jackson put his arm around him while he was listening to music. She said that Gavin was demanding, complained about the food, and was unruly during the flight.

Phillip LeMarque, Jackson&#x27;s cook, said that he entered Jackson&#x27;s room and saw Jackson with his hand in Culkin&#x27;s underpants. LeMarque and his wife, also a Jackson employee, had considered selling the story to a tabloid, but had backed out as the intermediary was &quot;sleazy&quot;. LeMarque said he had decided not to sell because it was &quot;against our principles&quot;.

Jesús Salas, a former house manager at the Neverland Ranch, testified that he often saw Jackson drunk or affected by prescription drugs, and once saw three teenage boys emerging drunk from the wine cellar after having spent time with Jackson. When the prosecution attempted to confirm Jackson had served wine to minors, Salas said that although he brought a bottle of wine to Jackson&#x27;s bedroom, sodas were also ordered for the children. The judge ruled out testimony from a former security guard who alleged that he saw Jackson in his bedroom with a boy.

==== Jordan Chandler ====
Jordan Chandler, the alleged victim in the 1993 child abuse allegations, left the country rather than appear as a witness. He had been legally emancipated from his parents.

Chandler&#x27;s mother, June Chandler, testified that Jordan complained that she would not allow him to spend time in Jackson’s bedroom. This appeared to upset Jackson, who had formed a bond with June and her children. June said Jackson asked her: &quot;You don’t trust me? We’re a family. Why are you doing this?&quot; She responded that Jordan should be allowed to sleep where he wanted, indicating a change of mind. Chandler testified that she had never suspected anything inappropriate between Jackson and Jordan. She told the court that she had not spoken to Jordan in eleven years.

==== Debbie Rowe ====
On April 28, Jackson&#x27;s ex-wife Debbie Rowe was called on the witness stand. The prosecution claimed that Rowe was forced into a scripted videotaped statement made in early 2003 in support of Jackson. They hoped Rowe&#x27;s testimony would support Janet Arvizo&#x27;s claim that they were held captive and forced to make supportive statements about Jackson. Instead, Rowe was supportive of Jackson and said his business associates Marc Schaffel, Dieter Wiesner and Ronald Konitzer were &quot;opportunistic vultures&quot; who wanted to exploit him. The prosecution moved to have Rowe dismissed, saying she was not providing the expected testimony, but her testimony was allowed by the judge.

==== Gavin Arvizo ====
Gavin Arvizo was 15 years old when he testified. He told the court that, after &quot;Living with Michael Jackson&quot; aired, Jackson had begun serving him and his younger brother wine, sometimes concealed in soda cans, showing them pornography and making sexual advances. He said that Jackson had twice manually stimulated him to ejaculation after they had drunk alcohol, and then told him that if men do not masturbate, they &quot;might rape a girl&quot;. Challenged by Mesereau, who said that Gavin had told sheriffs that his grandmother had said this, Gavin said he was not sure what his grandmother had told him. Gavin also testified he had told his school administrator that Jackson had not molested him.

==== Star Arvizo ====
Gavin&#x27;s younger brother, Star, told the court that he had twice seen Jackson molest Gavin. He also said that Jackson had displayed his erection and masturbated in front of them, telling them that &quot;everyone did it&quot;, and encouraged them to try it. Star testified that Jackson had given the boys alcohol, sometimes in soda cans, which Jackson called &quot;Jesus juice&quot;. Star also said Jackson had showed the brothers internet pornography on his computer.

On cross-examination, Mesereau questioned Star about a 1998 case in which his family sued J. C. Penney. The family alleged that Star, his brother and their mother were beaten in a parking lot by security guards after leaving with clothes they had not paid for. Janet Arvizo also claimed to have been sexually assaulted and falsely imprisoned. The family received a settlement of $152,000. In a 2000 sworn statement for the case, Star had said his &quot;mother and father never [fought].&quot; Janet and her children claimed that David Arvizo physically abused them for seventeen years. Star admitted he lied in the statement. The admission was a major victory to the defense. Also, it was stated that the Arvizos had not visited Neverland since March 2003. However, when shown a pornographic magazine dated August 2003, five months after the family stopped visiting Neverland, Star claimed that was one of the magazines Jackson had shown them. Star would later attempt to recant this testimony too.

==== Janet Arvizo ====
The defense sought to portray Janet Arvizo as untrustworthy, with a history of perjury and fraud. She admitted to having lied under oath in an earlier lawsuit. The prosecution planned to have an expert on domestic violence testify that she may have lied because she had been beaten by her ex-husband, but the judge did not allow it, saying it would be irrelevant. The defense also presented evidence of Janet having committed welfare fraud, for which she was later convicted.

In regards to the J.C. Penney case, which eventually settled for $152,000, the defense brought in a welfare worker who stated that Janet had failed to disclose her receipt of the settlement that her family had received days before filling out a welfare application. A paralegal testified that Janet had lied to win that lawsuit, claiming that bruises caused by her then-husband had been caused by J.C. Penney security guards.

Connie Keenan, the editor of the &quot;Mid Valley News&quot;, said she was &quot;duped&quot; by Janet into writing a story about Gavin&#x27;s sickness because the original story did not make enough money. Other witnesses for the defense showed Janet had spent $7,000 shopping and dining out at the same time she alleged Jackson kept her and her family captive. Janet&#x27;s sister-in-law offered to help Arvizo&#x27;s treatment by holding blood donation campaigns. She said Janet swore at her and rejected the offer.

=== Witnesses for the defense ===
According to Jackson&#x27;s defense attorney Susan Yu, over five hundred witnesses were prepared in the case.

==== Macaulay Culkin ====
The former child star Macaulay Culkin testified that he had shared a bed with Jackson on a dozen or more times between the ages of nine and 14, but had never been molested and had never seen Jackson act improperly, contrary to many of the prosecution&#x27;s witness testimonies. He said that his parents had known he was in Jackson&#x27;s bedroom and &quot;never saw it as an issue&quot;. He described shock at hearing allegations that Jackson had molested him, and dismissed them as &quot;absolutely ridiculous&quot;. Culkin said they had bonded over their shared experience of child stardom. Culkin has consistently defended Jackson since, and said in a 2020 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;: &quot;I never saw anything; he never did anything.&quot;

==== Wade Robson ====
Wade Robson testified as Jackson&#x27;s first defense witness that he had slept in Jackson&#x27;s bedroom several times but had never been molested. Robson recalled his first visit at Neverland Ranch in 1989 and had slept in Jackson&#x27;s bedroom on all but three or four of his twenty or so visits. He said they played video games, watched movies, talked and sometimes had pillow fights.

==== Brett Barnes ====
Barnes first met Jackson at the age of five when Jackson went to Australia during one of his tours. He shared a bedroom with Jackson at least ten times but denied any impropriety. Barnes was aware of the prosecutor&#x27;s witness testimonies claiming they had seen Jackson touch him inappropriately. In response, Barnes said, &quot;I&#x27;m very mad about it. It&#x27;s not true and they put my name through the dirt. I&#x27;m really not happy about it.&quot; In 2019, Barnes restated his denial of any molestation.

==== George Lopez ====
George Lopez testified that he had given the Arvizo family money when Gavin was fighting cancer, but came to believe that Gavin&#x27;s father was more interested in money than helping his son. Lopez cut ties with the family after the father became more demanding. Lopez also said that the father had accused him of stealing $300 from Gavin&#x27;s wallet. When the father asked what he was supposed to tell his son, Lopez testified that he responded: &quot;Tell him his father&#x27;s an extortionist.&quot;

==== Jay Leno ====
Jay Leno testified about his relationship with the Arvizo family. Leno made approximately 20 phone calls to sick children each week, and began receiving voicemail messages from Gavin, then a ten-year-old cancer patient, in 2000. Gavin called Leno &quot;his hero&quot;, which Leno felt was unusual as &quot;I&#x27;m not Batman... It sounded suspicious when a young person got overly effusive.&quot; Leno also said he heard another voice in the background of one call; the defense argued that this was Janet telling Gavin what to say.

==== Chris Tucker ====
Chris Tucker said he had felt sorry for the Arvizos, and he had given them money and gifts. He felt the Arvizos expected too much, calling him their &quot;brother&quot; and taking advantage of him. He testified that he had warned Jackson about the family, whom he called &quot;cunning&quot;.

=== 1994 settlement ===
The judge allowed investigation evidence from Jackson&#x27;s previous allegations to be used in the trial, but the 1994 settlement initiated by the Chandlers was deemed &quot;irrelevant and inflammatory&quot;. The prosecution attempted to subpoena evidence from the settlement as an indication of guilt. Mesereau argued that Jackson was not liable for any of the claims compromised by the arrangement, because Jackson&#x27;s insurance company, Transamerica Insurance Group, was responsible for it. The insurance company negotiated the settlement over protests from Jackson and his legal counsel. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing or guilt, otherwise, it would violate the California Insurance Code. The insurance company had &quot;the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements,&quot; a practice established by several precedents in California. Evidence of insurance settlements would deprive Jackson of due process of law, proper cross-examination and violate Evidence Code 352 as he would not be able to verify the agreements made in the settlement. The settlement cannot be used as evidence of guilt in future civil and criminal cases.

The settlement cannot prevent criminal investigation or criminal proceeding, neither can non-disclosure agreements. Bribery to not testify in a trial is a felony, and accepting such bribes is also a felony.

==Verdict==
The jury deliberated for about 32 hours over seven days. On the initial vote, nine jurors voted to acquit Jackson, while three voted guilty. On June 13, 2005, they returned a verdict of not guilty on all charges. Jurors found the prosecution&#x27;s case weak and the timeline of accusations problematic because they had claimed the molestation allegedly occurred after the broadcast of the documentary, when the world&#x27;s attention was on Jackson and Gavin. Jurors also described Janet&#x27;s testimony as weak, and found it strange that she snapped her fingers and addressed them directly. Likewise, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her testimony as &quot;rambling, incoherent and at times combative&quot;. One juror believed that Janet was a scam artist. Another juror remarked that &quot;there wasn&#x27;t a shred of evidence that was able to show us or give us any doubt in voting guilty. It was pretty obvious there was no other way to vote other than not guilty.&quot; 

In a news conference held after the trial, a juror said, &quot;We expected better evidence, something that was a little more convincing. It just wasn&#x27;t there.&quot; Sneddon suggested that Jackson’s celebrity status and the media had influenced the verdict. The jury foreman, a retired high school counselor, said, &quot;We looked at all the evidence and we looked at Michael Jackson and one of the first things we decided was we had to look at him just as another person and not a celebrity.&quot;

==Media coverage==

The trial attracted international media attention, and several commentators described it as a media circus. When news of the raid on Jackson&#x27;s home broke, many channels switched to 24-hour rolling coverage; CBS, NBC, ABC and VH1 produced television specials. The media covered Jackson&#x27;s health, dress and behavior, such as when he hopped on top of a car and waved to fans. The networks E! and Sky TV collaborated to produce re-enactments of highlights from the trial, which were broadcast daily. The re-enactment used look-alike actors, with impersonator Edward Moss portraying Jackson.

In 2010, the British journalist Charles Thomson described the trial as &quot;one of the most shameful episodes in journalistic history&quot;. He said the media coverage was &quot;out of control ... The sheer amount of propaganda, bias, distortion, and misinformation is almost beyond comprehension.&quot; The &quot;Huffington Post&quot; contributor Luka Neskovic wrote that the trial &quot;displayed media at their worst&quot;, with &quot;sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, eccentrics, chaos, and hysteria&quot;. For example, according to Neskovic, when pornography was found in Jackson&#x27;s home, many media outlets misreported it as child pornography. Neskovic observed that the media was more interested in reporting the prosecution than the defense, and that, for example, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; chose not to report two weeks of the defense case.

== Aftermath ==
Following the trial, Mesereau said Jackson would no longer allow people to enter in his room and would no longer &quot;easily allow people to enter his life&quot;, as he had become a target for &quot;people who want to extract money or build careers&quot;. Jackson moved to the Persian Gulf island country of Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. According to Jackson&#x27;s brother Jermaine, unbeknownst to Jackson, the family had intended to send him to Bahrain had he been convicted due to Bahrain not having an extradition treaty with the United States. Jackson then lived in Ireland. He never returned to Neverland Ranch, saying it had been despoiled by police searches. 

The allegations continued to affect Jackson&#x27;s career. Despite selling out a series of concerts in 2009, he was unable to find sponsors or merchandise partners. A judge observed in 2021 that &quot;the fact that he earned not a penny from his image and likeness in 2006, 2007, or 2008 shows the effect those allegations had, and continued to have, until his death&quot;. 

In June 2009, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. After Jackson&#x27;s death in 2009, Bashir told ABC News that he never saw any wrongdoing on Jackson&#x27;s part, and said he felt Jackson&#x27;s life had been &quot;unorthodox&quot; but not criminal. FBI files released after Jackson&#x27;s death noted that there were no outstanding leads or evidence items. In a 2017 episode of the true crime series &quot;The Jury Speaks&quot;, the four featured jurors of the trial said they would still vote to acquit Jackson, citing a lack of evidence. 

=== Further allegations ===

In 2013, the Australian choreographer Wade Robson, who had testified in the trial that Jackson had not molested him, reversed his position. He said Jackson had molested him over seven years when he was a child. In 2014, another man who had spent time with Jackson as a child, James Safechuck, alleged that Jackson had also abused him. In March 2019, a documentary about their allegations, &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;, aired, triggering further examination of Jackson&#x27;s legacy.

<text>Modimolle, also known as Nylstroom, is a town located near the southern edge of the Waterberg Massif in Limpopo province, South Africa. It is a medium-sized town that focuses primarily on agriculture and farming (citrus, grapes and cattle) as well as wildlife and tourism. Nylstroom is also located approximately north of Pretoria, South Africa&#x27;s capital city.

The Waterberg Biosphere spreading north, a UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserve, contains approximately . Waterberg is the first region in the northern part of South Africa to be named as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. The extensive rock formation was shaped by hundreds of millions of years of riverine erosion to yield diverse bluff and butte landform. The ecosystem can be characterised as a dry deciduous forest or Bushveld.

==History==

In the 1860s, a group of Voortrekkers known as the &quot;Jerusalem Trekkers&quot; set off for the Holy Land. After discovering a wide river flowing northwards, they consulted the maps at the back of their Bibles and decided that it was the &quot;Nylrivier&quot; (Nile river). They called the stream Nyl River and settled the town and called it &quot;Nylstroom&quot; in 1866. After discovering what they believed to be a ruined pyramid, they were convinced that they had found the Nile. It was in fact, a natural hillock, known to the locals as &quot;Modimolle&quot;. In March 1866, the district of &quot;Waterberg&quot; was created out of some of the districts of &quot;Rustenburg&quot; and &quot;Zoutpansberg&quot; with a landdrost established in Nylstroom. A Dutch Reformed Church was built in 1889 and is the oldest church in South Africa north of Pretoria. It was also used as a hospital during the Second Boer War. The river is the Nyl River, a tributary of the Mogalakwena River.

The first South African railway line reached Modimolle in 1898, connecting the town to Pretoria. During the Second Boer War, the British government operated a concentration camp in Modimolle, where Boer women and children where interned as part of the Lord Kitchener&#x27;s scorched earth policy. 544 of those interned at the camp died of various causes before it was closed upon the conclusion of the war in 1902. &quot;Strijdom Huis&quot; (Strijdom House) was the primary residence of the 6th Prime Minister of South Africa, JG Strijdom, and is situated in Modimolle.

===Name change===
The South African government officially changed the name of the town to &quot;Modimolle&quot; in 2002. The name comes from the Sotho-Tswana phrase, &quot;Modimo o lle&quot;, meaning &quot;the forefather&#x27;s spirit has eaten&quot;, or &quot;God has eaten&quot;.

Other numerous name changes include the renaming of both a municipal building and the town hall after Oliver Tambo, the library being renamed the &quot;Ruth First Memorial Library&quot;, as well as the renaming of several streets.

==Notable people==

*Christiaan Beyers – Boer general, and Commandant-General of the Union Defence Force
*Carel Boshoff – Professor of theology and Afrikaner white nationalist
*Lucas Malan – Afrikaans academic and poet
*Eugène Marais – Poet, journalist, lawyer, naturalist and author

<text>Our Finest Flowers is an album by American art rock group the Residents, released in 1992. For their 20th anniversary, instead of releasing a greatest hits compilation, they decided to release an album of new songs created by combining various components of different past songs. The Residents borrowed from not only their own past original songs, but some of their known cover songs and songs by frequent collaborators Snakefinger and Renaldo and the Loaf. The liner notes refer to the album as &quot;Celebrating Twenty Long Dreary Years of Obscure Stardom&quot;.

==Liner notes==
The liner notes from the original album explain the album as follows:

:&quot;What&#x27;s a group to do when its twentieth birthday rolls around; when the only comparable lasting musical units are the Grateful Dead or The Rolling Stones, and they both have had members die, for christsake. Some people thought a nice collection of &quot;greatest hits&quot; would be a suitable observance. So The Residents tried to write down their &quot;greatest hits&quot; until suddenly one of the guys got a stomach ache and threw up on the song listing. The guy that made the mess had to wash the list off and in the process pretty well smeared the ink all around the paper. Everybody thought it was funny so they started reading the words, or at least what the words looked like. &quot;Perfect Goat,&quot; one said. &quot;I think we should put that on our album&quot;&quot;
:&quot;They knew the vomit was no accident, it was an omen. They tore the paper into little pieces and dropped them onto the floor. It was still wet. Some of the pieces you couldn&#x27;t read anymore, but they didn&#x27;t seem to care. Somehow, ideas came from those torn slips. And sure enough, &quot;Perfect Goat&quot; did make it on the album, along with fifteen other tracks that Dr. Frankenstein would have surely been proud to have stitched together. Yes, these are new songs. Just like all good pop music, there is something familiar about them, something friendly. But as you listen, never forget that vomit is at their core: twenty long years of painful regurgitation.&quot;

<text>Gingerbread Man is an album by American art rock group The Residents, released in 1995. It was their first foray into computer graphics. Original versions of the CD were &quot;enhanced&quot; with animations that followed the music when played on a computer. The animations served as a basis for the costumes of the characters when a number of the songs were performed in the 25th anniversary shows in 1997. Later the same year regular CDs, with just the music, were released. The inside cover of the album special edition was held together with a branded label of Velcro.

# &quot;The Weaver: The fool and the death-maker die alone&quot;
# &quot;The Dying Oilman: Blinded by the hostages of fortune&quot;
# &quot;The Confused Transsexual: Stamen and pistillate together again&quot;
# &quot;The Sold-Out Artist: Black are the legs inside the white sepulchre&quot;
# &quot;The Ascetic: Shadows doubt the strength of the sun&quot;
# &quot;The Old Soldier: Safety sells, but war always wins&quot;

The game takes place in the titular Midway where the player first takes control of Timmy, an easily amused 10-year-old boy, but is soon able to switch perspective and control to a number of different characters as they navigate through the fair. The goal isn&#x27;t made very clear, as the game is considered first and foremost to be more of an interactive narrative and visual experience, but there are various ways to die during gameplay, and multiple endings can be achieved depending on which characters are left alive at the end of one in-game day.

The character Timmy was later brought back in a series of short videos by the Residents in 2006. In 2012, a novel was published based on the game&#x27;s story, along with a CD of &quot;reconsidered&quot; music from the game&#x27;s soundtrack.

The game was optioned by Ron Howard at Imagine Television for a proposed series to be directed by David Lynch. After two years of meetings with Lynch, the project was dropped because a script was never agreed upon. Had the project moved forward, The Residents would not have been creatively involved as their contract only gave them consulting roles in the pilot.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Bad Day&quot; is entirely mouse-controlled. The game&#x27;s core gameplay mechanic is the possibility to switch control and perspective to most of the game&#x27;s characters, essentially &quot;getting inside their heads.&quot; The player always begins the game in control of Timmy, and characters must be in view before the player has the option to switch over to them. Once the character is in view, the player must simply click on them to switch over. 

The character currently in control of the player will occasionally display random strands of thought on the bottom of the screen, sometimes in reaction to the game&#x27;s events, locations, or other characters, who will often interact with the player as they interact. These thought displays serve only for character exposition, but can sometimes clue the player in on what to do or where to go next. 

Every character in the game (except Jocko) has a life story sequence done by a different visual artist. They aren&#x27;t important to complete the game, again serving only as character exposition. Most of these stories can be accessed by meeting their corresponding character in a specific location, although some stories have further requirements for access. 

Even though there are death scenarios and multiple endings, the game doesn&#x27;t contain any action or puzzle sequences; the player is instead encouraged to simply explore the Midway and listen to the characters&#x27; life stories. However, each playable character does have their own objective, and the game does run on a very arbitrary time limit: occasionally a clock will appear on the top of the screen. When this clock does appear seems to be random, and it only displays what time it is, not that time has passed. Time passes usually when the player enters or exits a building. The game begins at 1:00PM and ends at midnight. If the player has survived by then, the game will trigger one of its ending sequences.

== Characters ==

* Timmy - A 10-year-old boy. The player always begins the game in control of him. He is easily amused and full of wonder, showing great interest in everything. He is immune to most death scenarios in the game as he is &quot;protected by his youth.&quot; Timmy is voiced by Diana Alden.
* Dixie - The new owner and boss of the Midway. She runs the Kill-A-Commie Shooting Gallery where she also takes care of her comatose husband Ike. She dresses like a stereotypical cowgirl because of her dream to become a country &amp; western singer. She tries to keep a positive outlook on life, but is troubled by her husband&#x27;s situation, loneliness, and problems with the IRS. After the IRS Man demands to see the Midway&#x27;s tax records from the past five years, Dixie&#x27;s objective is to find Ike&#x27;s tax documents. Dixie is voiced by Molly Harvey; her life story is illustrated by Ronald M. Davis.
* Ike - The previous owner of the Midway, currently comatose and kept in a private room by his wife Dixie. Most of the game&#x27;s characters assume he died after a mysterious accident. He is a well-known Nazi sympathizer, who served in World War II, and owned a Nazi-themed miniature golf course before meeting and marrying Dixie. He doesn&#x27;t have a life story sequence per se, and due to him being in a coma, the player cannot take control of him. But his brain can still be accessed briefly. Ike is voiced by Ollie Gordon, and his dream sequence is animated by Bill Domonkos.
* Lottie - A freak performer whose special characteristics are her lack of legs (lost in a car accident), and a condition that makes her skin look like tree bark. Due to this condition, she adopts the stage name of &quot;Lottie the Human Log,&quot; and dresses like a tree as she sings a song telling her life story. She is the mother of Ted, and apart from Ike, is the only character in the game the player cannot switch over to. She is also normally never seen outside of her cabin. Lottie is voiced by Molly Harvey; her life story is illustrated by Georganne Deen.
* Ted - Lottie&#x27;s son and assistant, and secretly also a serial killer. He feels it is his duty to kill ugly things, a process which he calls &quot;ugly liberation.&quot; He then collects small pieces of flesh, hair and clothes and turns them into fake butterflies, which he finds beautiful. Unfortunately for the player, he believes most people are ugly as well, and will kill the player if they run into him in certain locations. He kills people by paralyzing them with a poison dart, then gives them a brief monologue before strangling them to death. Timmy is the only playable character Ted is friendly to and won&#x27;t kill, as he sees Timmy&#x27;s innocence as a beautiful thing. He also deeply loves his mother and finds her beautiful due to her persistence and optimism in the face of tragedy. Ted is voiced by Mark Morgan; his life story is illustrated by Dave McKean.
* Dagmar - A stripper who goes by the stage name of &quot;Dagmar the Dog Woman.&quot; Her body is covered in tattoos of dogs, each one representing a different failed relationship with a man. She is usually accompanied by her two Dobermans, Huck and Chuck. She is quite caustic and holds very cynical views on men and love. She dislikes Dixie, and takes a particular liking to the IRS Man. Dagmar is voiced by Sharon Ludtke; her life story is illustrated by Paul Mavrides.
*IRS Man - His real name is unknown; the game&#x27;s credits only refer to him as the IRS Man. He comes to the Midway to investigate a long history of tax evasion on part of its owners. He is extremely patriotic and proud of his job, but is also very dry and anal-retentive, even a bit antisocial. A dog lover, he takes particular interest in Dagmar. He is voiced by &quot;Seymore Hodges&quot; (a pseudonym for the singing Resident); his life story is illustrated by Doug Fraser.
* Otto - He runs the &quot;Oscar The Racing Rat&quot; game with his pet rat Oscar. He had a wife and child who deeply irritated him until he ran away from home, changed his name, and started his Racing Rat game in the Midway. He has a shrill, stuttering voice and a greedy, egotistical personality. With a secret letter from Jocko, he blackmails Dixie to pressure her into making enhancements to his Racing Rat attraction. Otto is voiced by John Sanborn; his life story is illustrated by Peter Kuper.
* Oscar - A rat with a strangely red-colored head, and the star of Otto&#x27;s Racing Rat game. He carries a deadly plague which is spread around the Midway once he bites Otto and runs away, prompting Otto to run around the Midway in panic looking for him. The plague&#x27;s notable symptoms seem to be an extremely high fever, and increased blood pressure causing one&#x27;s face to turn red; death soon follows. While the player can switch over to Oscar, they can&#x27;t assume control of him - he simply runs around the Midway before granting the player access to his life story sequence, illustrated by Richard Sala.
*Jocko - Ike&#x27;s foreman, and Dixie&#x27;s lover. He previously attempted to murder Ike in order to find the gold he supposedly hid somewhere on the Midway, and use the money to quit his job and run away with Dixie (although she had no knowledge of this plan and would not have approved of it). After the plan failed and only resulted in Ike being paralyzed, Jocko ran away. He comes back to the Midway in disguise to look for the gold and retrieve a tape containing footage of his attempted murder. Not much is known about his past, as he has no life story sequence, but it is implied he had a son and probably never met him. He is voiced by &quot;Elmore Madison&quot; (another pseudonym for the singing Resident).

==Music==
In 1996, the Residents released a &quot;soundtrack album&quot; titled &quot;Have a Bad Day&quot; - however, according to the album&#x27;s liner notes, although it does consist mostly of music from the game, the tracks are presented as small suites and sound collages, sometimes with either new or unused material.

Selections of music and visuals from the game would later be presented in a 10-minute video on the Residents&#x27; 2001 DVD &quot;Icky Flix&quot;. These music selections would also be re-recorded and performed on the DVD and its subsequent tour.

==Reception==

The game won the 1995 &#x27;Macrovision International User Conference Award&#x27; in two categories – Best Entertainment Title and Most Innovative Use of Multimedia. Gamespot gave the game 8.1 out of 10 stating “With graphics that perfectly match the story&#x27;s mood, hauntingly upbeat music, and superbly crafted characters, the twisted design team has forged a story that is engrossing and entertaining throughout.“

<text>Morphic is an interface construction environment which uses graphical objects called &quot;Morphs&quot; for simplified GUI-building which allow for flexibility and dynamism. It was originally created for Self, but later, was ported to other programming languages like Squeak, JavaScript, Python, and Objective-C.

==History==
Morphic was originally developed by Randy Smith and John Maloney for the Self programming language.

==Usage==
Morphic is used in Lively Kernel, a web programming environment under MIT License (originally developed by Sun Microsystems) which is written in JavaScript and HTML5 / Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). On a higher abstraction level Morphic is also used in the enterprise performance management toolkit of doCOUNT, based on Ruby on Rails. In order to serve as basis for the Snap! (formerly BYOB), a Morphic environment called Morphic.js was written in JavaScript by Jens Mönig using only the HTML5 Canvas APIs. Morphic is the basis for the standard user interface of Squeak and Pharo Smalltalk.

<text>Yoker () is an area of Glasgow, Scotland, located on the northern bank of the Clyde east of Clydebank, west of the city centre. The name is an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Eochair&quot; meaning a river bank.

From the fourteenth century, the Renfrew Ferry has linked Yoker with Renfrew on the south bank of the river. The shipbuilding industry drove the growth of the district in the 19th century; this has since declined, although the nearby Yarrows shipyard, now owned by BAE Systems, is still in operation. Motor vehicles and tramcars were also manufactured in Yoker, which is now an operations centre for the North Clyde Line, part of Glasgow&#x27;s suburban rail network. 

Yoker railway station has services on the North Clyde and Argyle Lines. Several buses travel along Dumbarton Road, the main thoroughfare between Glasgow and Clydebank which runs parallel to the river. A road bridge at the ferry crossing point was constructed in 2024, providing easier access to the retail and leisure facilities at Braehead.

The comedy series &quot;Limmy&#x27;s Show!&quot; featured a sketch in which perpetually stoned Dee Dee Durie travelled to Yoker on a whim, finding the experience an exciting and terrifying adventure rather than a mundane bus journey. A local café has taken the name &quot;Dee Dee&#x27;s&quot; as a reference to the sketch.

<text>Mathematical models can project how infectious diseases progress to show the likely outcome of an epidemic (including in plants) and help inform public health and plant health interventions. Models use basic assumptions or collected statistics along with mathematics to find parameters for various infectious diseases and use those parameters to calculate the effects of different interventions, like mass vaccination programs. The modelling can help decide which intervention(s) to avoid and which to trial, or can predict future growth patterns, etc.

==History==

The modelling of infectious diseases is a tool that has been used to study the mechanisms by which diseases spread, to predict the future course of an outbreak and to evaluate strategies to control an epidemic.

The first scientist who systematically tried to quantify causes of death was John Graunt in his book &quot;Natural and Political Observations made upon the Bills of Mortality&quot;, in 1662. The bills he studied were listings of numbers and causes of deaths published weekly. Graunt&#x27;s analysis of causes of death is considered the beginning of the &quot;theory of competing risks&quot; which according to Daley and Gani is &quot;a theory that is now well established among modern epidemiologists&quot;.

The earliest account of mathematical modelling of spread of disease was carried out in 1760 by Daniel Bernoulli. Trained as a physician, Bernoulli created a mathematical model to defend the practice of inoculating against smallpox. The calculations from this model showed that universal inoculation against smallpox would increase the life expectancy from 26 years 7 months to 29 years 9 months. Daniel Bernoulli&#x27;s work preceded the modern understanding of germ theory.

In the early 20th century, William Hamer and Ronald Ross applied the law of mass action to explain epidemic behaviour.

The 1920s saw the emergence of compartmental models. The Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model (1927) and the Reed–Frost epidemic model (1928) both describe the relationship between susceptible, infected and immune individuals in a population. The Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model was successful in predicting the behavior of outbreaks very similar to that observed in many recorded epidemics.

Recently, agent-based models (ABMs) have been used in exchange for simpler compartmental models. For example, epidemiological ABMs have been used to inform public health (nonpharmaceutical) interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Epidemiological ABMs, in spite of their complexity and requiring high computational power, have been criticized for simplifying and unrealistic assumptions. Still, they can be useful in informing decisions regarding mitigation and suppression measures in cases when ABMs are accurately calibrated.

==Assumptions==
Models are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based. If a model makes predictions that are out of line with observed results and the mathematics is correct, the initial assumptions must change to make the model useful.
* Rectangular and stationary age distribution, i.e., everybody in the population lives to age &quot;L&quot; and then dies, and for each age (up to &quot;L&quot;) there is the same number of people in the population. This is often well-justified for developed countries where there is a low infant mortality and much of the population lives to the life expectancy.
* Homogeneous mixing of the population, i.e., individuals of the population under scrutiny assort and make contact at random and do not mix mostly in a smaller subgroup. This assumption is rarely justified because social structure is widespread. For example, most people in London only make contact with other Londoners. Further, within London then there are smaller subgroups, such as the Turkish community or teenagers (just to give two examples), who mix with each other more than people outside their group. However, homogeneous mixing is a standard assumption to make the mathematics tractable.

==Types of epidemic models==
===Stochastic===
&quot;Stochastic&quot; means being or having a random variable. A stochastic model is a tool for estimating probability distributions of potential outcomes by allowing for random variation in one or more inputs over time. Stochastic models depend on the chance variations in risk of exposure, disease and other illness dynamics. Statistical agent-level disease dissemination in small or large populations can be determined by stochastic methods.

===Deterministic===
When dealing with large populations, as in the case of tuberculosis, deterministic or compartmental mathematical models are often used. In a deterministic model, individuals in the population are assigned to different subgroups or compartments, each representing a specific stage of the epidemic.

The transition rates from one class to another are mathematically expressed as derivatives, hence the model is formulated using differential equations. While building such models, it must be assumed that the population size in a compartment is differentiable with respect to time and that the epidemic process is deterministic. In other words, the changes in population of a compartment can be calculated using only the history that was used to develop the model.

===Kinetic and mean-field===
Formally, these models belong to the class of deterministic models; however, they incorporate heterogeneous social features into the dynamics, such as individuals&#x27; levels of sociality, opinion, wealth, geographic location, which profoundly influence disease propagation. These models are typically represented by partial differential equations, in contrast to classical models described as systems of ordinary differential equations. Following the derivation principles of kinetic theory, they provide a more rigorous description of epidemic dynamics by starting from agent-based interactions.

==Sub-exponential growth==

A common explanation for the growth of epidemics holds that 1 person infects 2, those 2 infect 4 and so on and so on with the number of infected doubling every generation.
It is analogous to a game of tag where 1 person tags 2, those 2 tag 4 others who&#x27;ve never been tagged and so on. As this game progresses it becomes increasing frenetic as the tagged run past the previously tagged to hunt down those who have never been tagged.
Thus this model of an epidemic leads to a curve that grows exponentially until it crashes to zero as all the population have been infected. i.e. no herd immunity and no peak and gradual decline as seen in reality.

== Epidemic Models on Networks ==
Epidemics can be modeled as diseases spreading over networks of contact between people. Such a network can be represented mathematically with a graph and is called the contact network. Every node in a contact network is a representation of an individual and each link (edge) between a pair of nodes represents the contact between them. Links in the contact networks may be used to transmit the disease between the individuals and each disease has its own dynamics on top of its contact network. The combination of disease dynamics under the influence of interventions, if any, on a contact network may be modeled with another network, known as a transmission network. In a transmission network, all the links are responsible for transmitting the disease. If such a network is a locally tree-like network, meaning that any local neighborhood in such a network takes the form of a tree, then the basic reproduction can be written in terms of the average excess degree of the transmission network such that:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the mean-degree (average degree) of the network and formula_3 is the second moment of the transmission network degree distribution. It is, however, not always straightforward to find the transmission network out of the contact network and the disease dynamics. For example, if a contact network can be approximated with an Erdős–Rényi graph with a Poissonian degree distribution, and the disease spreading parameters are as defined in the example above, such that formula_4 is the transmission rate per person and the disease has a mean infectious period of formula_5, then the basic reproduction number is formula_6 since formula_7 for a Poisson distribution.

== Reproduction number ==
The &quot;basic reproduction number&quot; (denoted by &quot;R&quot;0) is a measure of how transferable a disease is. It is the average number of people that a single infectious person will infect over the course of their infection. This quantity determines whether the infection will increase sub-exponentially, die out, or remain constant: if &quot;R&quot;0 &gt; 1, then each person on average infects more than one other person so the disease will spread; if &quot;R&quot;0 &lt; 1, then each person infects fewer than one person on average so the disease will die out; and if &quot;R&quot;0 = 1, then each person will infect on average exactly one other person, so the disease will become &quot;endemic:&quot; it will move throughout the population but not increase or decrease.

==Endemic steady state==
An infectious disease is said to be endemic when it can be sustained in a population without the need for external inputs. This means that, on average, each infected person is infecting &quot;exactly&quot; one other person (any more and the number of people infected will grow sub-exponentially and there will be an epidemic, any less and the disease will die out). In mathematical terms, that is:

: formula_8

The basic reproduction number (&quot;R&quot;0) of the disease, assuming everyone is susceptible, multiplied by the proportion of the population that is actually susceptible (&quot;S&quot;) must be one (since those who are not susceptible do not feature in our calculations as they cannot contract the disease). Notice that this relation means that for a disease to be in the endemic steady state, the higher the basic reproduction number, the lower the proportion of the population susceptible must be, and vice versa. This expression has limitations concerning the susceptibility proportion, e.g. the &quot;R&quot;0 equals 0.5 implicates S has to be 2, however this proportion exceeds the population size.

Assume the rectangular stationary age distribution and let also the ages of infection have the same distribution for each birth year. Let the average age of infection be &quot;A&quot;, for instance when individuals younger than &quot;A&quot; are susceptible and those older than &quot;A&quot; are immune (or infectious). Then it can be shown by an easy argument that the proportion of the population that is susceptible is given by:

: formula_9

We reiterate that &quot;L&quot; is the age at which in this model every individual is assumed to die. But the mathematical definition of the endemic steady state can be rearranged to give:

: formula_10

Therefore, due to the transitive property:

: formula_11

This provides a simple way to estimate the parameter &quot;R&quot;0 using easily available data.

For a population with an exponential age distribution,

: formula_12

This allows for the basic reproduction number of a disease given &quot;A&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in either type of population distribution.

== Compartmental models in epidemiology ==
 Compartmental models are formulated as Markov chains. A classic compartmental model in epidemiology is the SIR model, which may be used as a simple model for modelling epidemics. Multiple other types of compartmental models are also employed.

=== The SIR model ===
In 1927, W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick created a model in which they considered a fixed population with only three compartments: susceptible, formula_13; infected, formula_14; and recovered, formula_15. The compartments used for this model consist of three classes:
* formula_13 , or those susceptible to the disease of the population.
* formula_14 denotes the individuals of the population who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to those in the susceptible category.
* formula_15 is the compartment used for the individuals of the population who have been infected and then removed from the disease, either due to immunization or due to death. Those in this category are not able to be infected again or to transmit the infection to others.

=== Other compartmental models ===
There are many modifications of the SIR model, including those that include births and deaths, where upon recovery there is no immunity (SIS model), where immunity lasts only for a short period of time (SIRS), where there is a latent period of the disease where the person is not infectious (SEIS and SEIR), and where infants can be born with immunity (MSIR).

==Infectious disease dynamics==

Mathematical models need to integrate the increasing volume of data being generated on host-pathogen interactions. Many theoretical studies of the population dynamics, structure and evolution of infectious diseases of plants and animals, including humans, are concerned with this problem.

Research topics include:
* antigenic shift
* epidemiological networks
* evolution and spread of resistance
* immuno-epidemiology
* intra-host dynamics
* Pandemic
* pathogen population genetics
* persistence of pathogens within hosts
* phylodynamics
* role and identification of infection reservoirs
* role of host genetic factors
* spatial epidemiology
* statistical and mathematical tools and innovations
* Strain (biology) structure and interactions
* transmission, spread and control of infection
* virulence

==Mathematics of mass vaccination==
If the proportion of the population that is immune exceeds the herd immunity level for the disease, then the disease can no longer persist in the population and its transmission dies out. Thus, a disease can be eliminated from a population if enough individuals are immune due to either vaccination or recovery from prior exposure to disease. For example, smallpox eradication, with the last wild case in 1977, and certification of the eradication of indigenous transmission of 2 of the 3 types of wild poliovirus (type 2 in 2015, after the last reported case in 1999, and type 3 in 2019, after the last reported case in 2012).

The herd immunity level will be denoted &quot;q&quot;. Recall that, for a stable state:

:formula_19

In turn,

:formula_20

which is approximately:

:formula_21

&quot;S&quot; will be (1 − &quot;q&quot;), since &quot;q&quot; is the proportion of the population that is immune and &quot;q&quot; + &quot;S&quot; must equal one (since in this simplified model, everyone is either susceptible or immune). Then:

:formula_22

Remember that this is the threshold level. Die out of transmission will only occur if the proportion of immune individuals &quot;exceeds&quot; this level due to a mass vaccination programme.

We have just calculated the critical immunization threshold (denoted &quot;qc&quot;). It is the minimum proportion of the population that must be immunized at birth (or close to birth) in order for the infection to die out in the population.

: formula_23

Because the fraction of the final size of the population &quot;p&quot; that is never infected can be defined as:

:formula_24

Hence,

:formula_25

Solving for formula_26, we obtain:

:formula_27

===When mass vaccination cannot exceed the herd immunity===
If the vaccine used is insufficiently effective or the required coverage cannot be reached, the program may fail to exceed &quot;qc&quot;. Such a program will protect vaccinated individuals from disease, but may change the dynamics of transmission.

Suppose that a proportion of the population &quot;q&quot; (where &quot;q&quot; &lt; &quot;qc&quot;) is immunised at birth against an infection with &quot;R&quot;0 &gt; 1. The vaccination programme changes &quot;R&quot;0 to &quot;Rq&quot; where

: formula_28

This change occurs simply because there are now fewer susceptibles in the population who can be infected. &quot;Rq&quot; is simply &quot;R&quot;0 minus those that would normally be infected but that cannot be now since they are immune.

As a consequence of this lower basic reproduction number, the average age of infection &quot;A&quot; will also change to some new value &quot;Aq&quot; in those who have been left unvaccinated.

Recall the relation that linked &quot;R&quot;0, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. Assuming that life expectancy has not changed, now:

: formula_29
: formula_30

But &quot;R&quot;0 = &quot;L&quot;/&quot;A&quot; so:

: formula_31

Thus, the vaccination program may raise the average age of infection, and unvaccinated individuals will experience a reduced force of infection due to the presence of the vaccinated group. For a disease that leads to greater clinical severity in older populations, the unvaccinated proportion of the population may experience the disease relatively later in life than would occur in the absence of vaccine.

===When mass vaccination exceeds the herd immunity===
If a vaccination program causes the proportion of immune individuals in a population to exceed the critical threshold for a significant length of time, transmission of the infectious disease in that population will stop. If elimination occurs everywhere at the same time, then this can lead to eradication.

; Elimination
: Interruption of endemic transmission of an infectious disease, which occurs if each infected individual infects less than one other, is achieved by maintaining vaccination coverage to keep the proportion of immune individuals above the critical immunization threshold.
; Eradication
: Elimination everywhere at the same time such that the infectious agent dies out (for example, smallpox and rinderpest).

== Reliability ==

Models have the advantage of examining multiple outcomes simultaneously, rather than making a single forecast. Models have shown broad degrees of reliability in past pandemics, such as SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Swine flu, MERS and Ebola.

<doc id="951616" wikidata="Q525813" url="?curid=951616" title="Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford">
<text>Humphrey (VI) de Bohun (c. 1249 – 31 December 1298), 3rd Earl of Hereford and 2nd Earl of Essex, was an English nobleman known primarily for his opposition to King Edward I over the &quot;Confirmatio Cartarum.&quot; He was also an active participant in the Welsh Wars and maintained for several years a private feud with the earl of Gloucester. His father, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, fought on the side of the rebellious barons in the Barons&#x27; War. When Humphrey (V) predeceased his father, Humphrey (VI) became heir to his grandfather, Humphrey (IV). At Humphrey (IV)&#x27;s death in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. He also inherited major possessions in the Welsh Marches from his mother, Eleanor de Braose.

Bohun spent most of his early career reconquering marcher lands captured by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I&#x27;s war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 1282–83 and 1294–95. At the same time he also had private feuds with other marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford&#x27;s final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the &quot;Confirmatio Cartarum&quot;—a confirmation of Magna Carta—and Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.

==Family background and inheritance==
Humphrey (VI) de Bohun was part of a line of Anglo-Norman aristocrats going back to the Norman Conquest, most of whom carried the same name. His grandfather was Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, who had been part of the baronial opposition of Simon de Montfort, but later gone over to the royal side. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, but was restored to favour after the royalist victory at the Battle of Evesham the next year. Humphrey (IV)&#x27;s son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, remained loyal to the baronial side throughout the Barons&#x27; War, and was captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. In October of that year, Humphrey (V) died in captivity at Beeston Castle in Cheshire from injuries he had sustained in the battle.

Humphrey (V) had been excluded from succession as a result of his rebellion, but when Humphrey (IV) died in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. Humphrey (VI) had already served as deputy Constable of England under Humphrey (IV). Humphrey (IV) had reserved the honour of Pleshey for his younger son Henry, but the remainder of his lands went to Humphrey (VI). The inheritance Humphrey (VI) received—in addition to land in Essex and Wiltshire from Humphrey (IV)—also consisted of significant holdings in the Welsh Marches from his mother. His mother Eleanor was a daughter and coheir of William de Braose and his wife Eva Marshal, who in turn was the daughter and co-heir of William Marshal, regent to Henry III.

Since Humphrey (VI) was only sixteen years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death, the Braose lands were taken into the king&#x27;s custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the meanwhile given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade&#x27;s political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.

He granted his brother Sir Gilbert de Bohun all of their mother&#x27;s lands in Ireland and some land in England and Wales.

==Welsh Wars==

Over the next years, much of Hereford&#x27;s focus was on reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, primarily through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his son—now Edward I—was crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused to pay homage to the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford&#x27;s participation in the early days of the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.

In 1282, war with Wales broke out again; this time it would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a full-scale war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted on the use of the feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post-war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 1294–95, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.

==Private war in the Marches==

Parallel with the Welsh Wars, Hereford was also struggling to assert his claims to lands in the Marches against other marcher lords. In 1284 Edward I granted the hundred of Iscennen in Carmarthenshire to John Giffard. Hereford believed the land belonged to him by right of conquest, and started a campaign to win the lands back, but the king took Giffard&#x27;s side. Problems also arose with the earl of Gloucester. As Gloucester&#x27;s former ward, Hereford had to buy back his own right of marriage, but Gloucester claimed he had not received the full sum. There was also remaining resentment on Hereford&#x27;s part for his subordination to Gloucester in the 1282–83 campaign. The conflict came to a head when Gloucester&#x27;s started construction of a castle at Morlais, which Hereford claimed was his land. In 1286, the Crown ordered Gloucester to cease, but to no avail.

It had long been established Marches custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford&#x27;s problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, and now he was facing open conflict with two different enemies. He, therefore, decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford&#x27;s lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offence was not the private warfare in itself, but the fact that the earls had not respected the king&#x27;s injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester&#x27;s liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford&#x27;s of Brecon.

In the end, the fines were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had nevertheless demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marcher lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was, therefore, a good opportunity to assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.

==Opposition to Edward I==
In 1294 the French king declared the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and war broke out between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king&#x27;s subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not in the company of the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.
At the time of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was accompanying two of the king&#x27;s daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reason for the magnates&#x27; defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward&#x27;s continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king&#x27;s abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.

Neither party showed any inclination to back down, and the nation seemed on the brink of another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to settle it. In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king&#x27;s continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king. He agreed to confirm Magna Carta in the so-called &quot;Confirmatio Cartarum&quot; (Confirmation of the Charters). The earls consequently consented to serve with the king in Scotland, and Hereford was in the army that won a decisive victory over the Scots in the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Hereford, not satisfied that the king had upheld the charter, withdrew after the battle, forcing Edward to abandon the campaign.

==Death and family==
In 1275 Bohun married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand de Fiennes, chevalier, seigneur of Fiennes, by his 2nd wife, Isabel (kinswoman of Queen Eleanor of Provence ). She predeceased him, and was buried at Walden Priory in Essex. Hereford himself died at Pleshey Castle on 31 December 1298, and was buried at Walden alongside his wife. They had one son Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, born around 1276. The son was given possession of his father&#x27;s lands and titles on 16 February 1299. The young Humphrey also inherited his father&#x27;s title of Constable of England.

A common theme in Humphrey de Bohun&#x27;s actions was his fierce protection of what he regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, at the height of the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford&#x27;s authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.

<text>Nueva Trova (, &quot;new trova&quot;) is a movement in Cuban music that emerged around 1967-1968 after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, and the consequent political and social changes.

Nueva Trova has its roots in the traditional trova, but differs from it because its content is, in the widest sense, political. It combines traditional folk music idioms with &#x27;progressive&#x27; and often politicized lyrics. It is related to nueva canción in Latin America, especially Chile and Argentina. Some of the Nueva Trova musicians were also influenced by rock and pop of that time. 

Nueva Trova is defined by its connection with the Cuban revolution, and by its lyrics, which tried to escape the banalities of life by concentrating on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar issues. Haydée Santamaría was the creator and sponsor of this movement.

==Influences==
Nueva Trova was one aspect of the Pan-Latin American &quot;new song movement&quot; which tended to use lyrics that were self-consciously literary, formal and schooled. Another influence was that of filín (feeling), a romantic song movement of the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Pablo Milanés, for one, was a filín singer.

At approximately the same time as the rise of Nueva Trova, similar musical genres across the world were increasing in popularity as part of a roots revival; these involved the popularization of traditional music welded with socio-political lyrics. Nueva Trova was most closely influenced by South American (especially Chilean) nueva canción, Spanish Nova Cançó, Bolivian canto nuevo, Portuguese canto livre and nova canção, and Brazilian Tropicalismo. At about the same time, Puerto Ricans like Roy Brown, Andrés Jiménez, Antonio Cabán Vale and the group Haciendo Punto en Otro Son also became popular.

Though inspired by American protest artists like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, Nueva Trova criticized the abuses of the United States government and its allies. Other major influences include The Beatles, Chilean revivalist Violeta Parra, Uruguayan singer-songwriter Daniel Viglietti and the Catalan protest singer Joan Manuel Serrat.

In both Cuba and Puerto Rico, the politicized lyrics of Nueva Trova were very often critical of the United States; Puerto Rican singers were especially critical of Vieques&#x27; continued use as a United States Navy training ground.

Nueva Trova is defined, not only by its connection with Castro&#x27;s revolution, but also by its lyrics. The lyrics try to escape the banalities of life (e.g. love) by concentrating on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar &#x27;serious&#x27; issues. Silvio Rodríguez, Noel Nicola, and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of this style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.

The government gave support to musicians willing to write and sing anti-U.S. and pro-revolution songs. This was an additional incentive in a period when many of the traditional musicians found it difficult or impossible to earn a living. 

In 1967, the &quot;Casa de las Américas&quot; in Havana held a &quot;Festival de la canción de protesta&quot; (protest songs). Tania Castellanos, a filín singer and author, wrote &quot;¡Por Ángela!&quot; in support of Angela Davis. César Portillo de la Luz wrote &quot;Oh, valeroso Viet Nam&quot;.

Although Nueva Trova expressed the socio-economic issues of Cuba, later on some musicians chose to express these issues through Rap Cubano which they viewed as more pure and more to the street.

== Decline ==
Nueva Trova had its heyday in the 1970s, but was already declining before the fall of the Soviet Union. Examples of non-political styles in the Nueva Trova movement can be found, such as Liuba María Hevia, whose lyrics are focused on more traditional subjects such as love and solitude, though like others in the movement deploying a highly poetical style. On the other side of the spectrum, Carlos Varela is famous in Cuba for his open criticism of some aspects of Castro&#x27;s revolution.

Nueva Trova was dealt a blow by the fall of the Soviet Union. It became less popular inside Cuba and also externally, in vivid contrast to the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings, highlighting the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. Nevertheless Nueva Trova songs and albums of high musical and lyrical quality, such as Carlos Puebla&#x27;s &quot;Hasta siempre&quot;, remain popular.

<text>William &quot;Bill&quot; Franklin Porter III (March 24, 1926 – March 10, 2000) was an American track and field athlete, gold medal winner of the 110-meter hurdles at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Born in Jackson, Michigan, Porter attended the Jackson High School, but did not compete in any sport there. He took up hurdle running while attending The Hill School in Pennsylvania. He then enrolled to the Western Michigan University, and later transferred to the Northwestern University, where he captained the athletics team.

Porter won his only AAU Championship title in 1948 in 110 m hurdles and thus qualified for the Olympic Games. The best American hurdler at the time was Harrison Dillard. He beat Porter to the second place at the 1947 and 1948 NCAA Championships, but fell ill at the 1948 Olympic trials and 
did not qualify. At the Olympics three other Americans: Porter, Clyde Scott and Craig Dixon were headlong over the rest of the field in the Olympic final. From the start to finish they ran almost neck to neck, with the others some five yards behind. In the finish, Porter gained a clear win, setting his personal best and a new Olympic record.

Porter married shortly before the 1948 Olympics, and retired from competitions soon after that. He later worked for the Northwestern Alumni Association Board and after that opened a medical supply agency in California.

<doc id="951649" wikidata="Q1973013" url="?curid=951649" title="Scopitone">
<text>Scopitone is a type of jukebox featuring a 16 mm film component. Scopitone films were a forerunner of music videos. The 1959 Italian Cinebox/Colorama and Color-Sonics were competing, lesser-known technologies of the time one year before the Scopitone in France.

Based on Soundies technology developed during World War II, color 16 mm film shorts with a magnetic soundtrack were designed to be shown in a specially designed jukebox. The difference between the Panoram and the Scopitone jukebox was that with Panoram the 16mm films were black and white with optical sound and there was no selection among the 8 short films in the jukebox, whereas Scopitone featured color (in the US produced films Technicolor), with Hi-Fi magnetic soundtracks, with selection available between all 36 Scopitone films in the Scopitone Jukebox. Scopitone films, like Soundies, featured recordings that performers lip synced to, with at least one exception; Billy Lee Riley was recorded live performing the song &quot;High Heel Sneakers&quot; in his Scopitone. 

Between 1940 and 1946, three-minute musical films called Soundies (produced in New York City, Chicago and Hollywood) were displayed on a Panoram, the first coin-operated film jukebox or &quot;machine music&quot;. These were set up in nightclubs, bars, restaurants and amusement centers.

After 2005, the word &#x27;Scopitone&#x27; was dedicated as a name for type of music video which is highlighted on musicians, playback artists, and composers on screen. Composer and conductor James Horner first used the Scopitone name for his video as a remembrance of the Scopitone jukebox.

==History==

The first Scopitones were made in France by a company called Cameca on Blvd Saint Denis in Courbevoie, among them Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Le poinçonneur des Lilas&quot; (filmed in 1958 in the Porte des Lilas Métro station), Johnny Hallyday&#x27;s &quot;Noir c&#x27;est noir&quot; a French version of Los Bravos&#x27; &quot;Black Is Black&quot;) and the &quot;Hully Gully&quot; showing a dance around a swimming pool.

Scopitones spread to West Germany, where the Kessler Sisters burst out of twin steamer trunks to sing &quot;Quando Quando&quot; on the dim screen that surmounted the jukebox. Scopitone went on to appear in bars in England, including a coffee bar in Swanage where &quot;Telstar&quot; was a favourite. By 1964, approximately 500 machines were installed in the United States, most of which were deliberately targeted at cocktail lounges and adult establishments, in part to avoid competition with the jukebox industry for the teen audience. By 1966, reportedly 800 machines were installed in bars and nightclubs in the US, at a cost of $3500 apiece. This, in turn, required production of new Scopitone films for the American audience, many of which were produced on contract with Debbie Reynolds&#x27;s production company.

Several well-known acts of the 1960s appear in Scopitone films, ranging from the earlier part of the decade The Exciters (&quot;Tell Him&quot;) and Neil Sedaka (&quot;Calendar Girl&quot;) to Bobby Vee (&quot;The Night Has a Thousand Eyes&quot; and &quot;Baby Face&quot;) and later 1960s acts such as Gary Lewis (&quot;Little Miss Go-Go&quot;), Jody Miller (&quot;The Race Is On&quot; and her biggest hit &quot;Queen of the House&quot;) and Procol Harum (&quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;). In one Scopitone recording, Dionne Warwick lay on a white shag rug with an offstage fan urging her to sing &quot;Walk on By&quot;. Another had Nancy Sinatra and a troupe of go-go girls shimmy to &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;. Inspired by burlesque, blonde bombshell Joi Lansing performed &quot;Web of Love&quot; and &quot;The Silencer&quot;, and Julie London sang &quot;Daddy&quot; against a backdrop of strippers. Mary &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Phelps of Dick and Dee Dee recalled in 2006 being asked to record a Scopitone for one of their more obscure records and not their biggest hit; when she saw the finished product, she was appalled by its disjointed appearance. The artifice of such scenes led Susan Sontag to identify Scopitone films as &quot;part of the canon of Camp&quot; in her 1964 essay &quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp&#x27;&quot;.

The medium&#x27;s focus on adult audiences, and the resulting avoidance of or inability to lure the superstar American or British Invasion acts of the era, was a factor in its demise; for example, when The Beatles decided to enter the music video business in 1965, they opted to bypass the Scopitone and distribute their promotional films via television. Other factors included the declining taste and poor quality of the productions (particularly those made in the United States), changing taste toward psychedelic rock and a late 1960s sting that revealed that the Scopitone business had deep ties to the Sicilian Mafia.

Even though the popularity of the Scopitone had faded away by the end of the 1960s,the same concept was still in limited use throughout the 1970s by acts such as the Carpenters and ABBA, both of whose early productions were shot on 16mm film before transitioning to videotape. Toward the late 1960s, films produced for the rival Color-Sonic video jukebox were adapted to the Scopitone. The last official film for a Scopitone was made at the end of 1978. 

In 1990, a selection of Scopitones was screened at the Jewel Box theater in Seattle by Dennis Nyback.

In 2006, French singer Mareva Galanter released several videos which mimic the Scopitone style. Galenta&#x27;s album &quot;Ukuyéyé&quot; features several songs in the French Yé-yé style. She also recently hosted a weekly French television program called &quot;Do you do you Scopitone&quot; on the Paris Première channel.

As of 2012, one of the few Scopitones not in a museum or private collection in the United States is at Third Man Records in Nashville, Tennessee. Many Scopitone films have been released on DVD or made available on the internet.

The Swiss technology museum Enter has one Scopitone on display.

<doc id="951653" wikidata="Q4811649" url="?curid=951653" title="Astronomical Society of Southern Africa">
<text>The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa (ASSA), formed in 1922, is a widespread body consisting of both amateur and professional astronomers. There are eight autonomous centres throughout Southern Africa.

==History==
The Cape Astronomical Association was established in 1912, shortly after the 1910 appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet. Sydney Samuel Hough, HM Astronomer at the Cape, was chosen President. In 1918, the Johannesburg Astronomical Association was created, with RTA Innes, Union Astronomer, as President. In 1922 it was decided to merge the two Associations to form the Astronomical Society of South Africa after an invitation from the Cape Association. In 1956 the name was amended to become the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa.

==Membership and publications==
Membership is open to all interested persons. The Society publishes the on-line peer-reviewed journal &quot;Monthly Notes of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa&quot; (&quot;MNASSA&quot;). In addition to &quot;MNASSA&quot;, the annual handbook &quot;Sky Guide Africa South&quot; (&quot;SkyGuide&quot;) is distributed to members and is available for the public.

==Some notable former members==
* John Caister Bennett served as president of the society for some time from 1969. Bennet discovered comet C/1969 (&quot;Comet Bennett&quot;) and main-belt asteroid 4093 Bennett is also named after him.
* Alexander F. I. Forbes discovered comet 37P/Forbes.
* Robert T. A. Innes, discoverer of the nearest star, Proxima Cen 
* John Francis Skjellerup was one of the founding members of the society. A number of comets carry his name, including 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup and Comet Skjellerup-Maristany. A comet discovery by Skjellerup was one of the main reasons for the formation of the Cape Astronomical Association in 1912.
*Jan Christian Smuts, South African statesman, World War II leader and author of the preamble to the United Nations charter was an ordinary fee-paying member.

==Gill Medal==

The Gill Medal is awarded by the Council of the Society for services to astronomy with special consideration to services in southern Africa. It was established in 1955 April and was first awarded in 1956 to Harold Knox Shaw.
The Medal commemorates Sir David Gill, HM Astronomer at the Cape (1879–1907), renowned for his numerous researches, especially in positional astronomy and geodesy, and for his part in consolidating astronomical science in Southern Africa.

The medal has been awarded to:
*H. Knox-Shaw (1956)
*W.P. Hirst (1957)
*J. Jackson (1958)
*W.H. van den Bos (1960)
*A.W.J. Cousins (1963)
*R.H. Stoy (1965)
*W.S. Finsen (1967)
*J.C. Bennett (1970) (see Comet Bennett)
*A.D. Thackeray (1976)
*C. Papadopoulos(1981)
*M.W. Feast(1983)
*M.D. Overbeek (1984)
*D.S. Evans (1988)
*B. Warner (1992)
*G. Nicolson (1997)
*I.S. Glass (1999)
*L.A.G. Monard (2004)
*L. Cross (2010)
*D. O&#x27;Donoghue (2011)

==Activities==

Various sections exist within the Society to co-ordinate the activities of special interest groups, including the running of observational programs. They consist of the Comets and Meteor Section, Dark Sky, Deep-Sky, Education &amp; Public Communication, Double Stars, Historical, Occultations, Solar and Variable Stars. A national Symposium, organised by one of the Centres, is held every second year. Scopex, a large public outreach event, is held every year under the auspices of the Johannesburg Centre.

==Autonomous centres==

The autonomous local centres of ASSA hold regular meetings where visitors are welcomed. Centres are situated in Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Hermanus, the Garden Route, Midlands, Johannesburg and Pretoria.

<doc id="951655" wikidata="Q724688" url="?curid=951655" title="Widowers' Houses">
<text>Widowers&#x27; Houses (1892) was the first play by George Bernard Shaw to be staged. It premièred on 9 December 1892 at the Royalty Theatre, under the auspices of the Independent Theatre Society — a subscription club, formed to escape the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office censorship.

==Characters==
*Harry Trench
*William de Burgh Cokane
*Mr. Sartorius
*Lickcheese
*Waiter
*Porter
*Blanche
*The Parlor Maid

==Plot==

The play comprises three acts:

In &quot;Act I&quot; a poor but aristocratic young doctor named Harry Trench and his friend William Cokane are holidaying at Remagen on the Rhine. They encounter fellow travellers Mr Sartorius, a self-made businessman, and his daughter Blanche. Harry and Blanche fall in love and become engaged.

&quot;Act II&quot; opens with everyone back at home in London. Sartorius, in talking to Mr Lickcheese, whom he employs as a rent-collector, reveals himself to be a slum landlord. He dismisses Lickcheese for dealing too leniently with tenants. Trench and Cokane arrive to visit, but when Trench discovers that Sartorius makes his money by renting slum housing to the poor, he is disgusted and refuses to allow Blanche to accept money from her father after they are married, insisting that they must live instead on Harry&#x27;s small income. Following a bitter argument, they break up. Sartorius reveals that Trench&#x27;s income depends on interest from mortgaged tenements, and is therefore as &quot;dirty&quot; as his own; but the lovers do not reconcile. Blanche utterly rejects Harry because of her wounded feelings.

In &quot;Act III&quot;, Trench, Cokane and Lickcheese return to Sartorius&#x27; house to plan a shady business venture. Trench, disillusioned and coarsened by knowing his income is tainted by its source, no longer takes the moral high ground. In the final scene, notable for its erotic tension, Harry and Blanche reunite.

==Creation and publication==
The play had originally been written in 1885 as a collaboration with William Archer; but the two fell out and this first attempt was abandoned. Shaw reorganised his fragments, and added a third act for the production, at the invitation of Jakub Grein.

The name of the play comes from the Bible. Bernard Shaw wrote 17.11.1905 his first German translator Siegfried Trebitsch: &quot;Get a Bible and look at Ev. Matthae XXIII, 14. &quot;Weh euch, die Schriftgelehrte und Pharisäer, ihr Heuchler, die ihr der Witwen Hauser presset…&quot; [Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye devour widows’houses…] The play should be called „Witwen Hauser&quot; or „Weh euch, ihr Heuchler&quot;, or something else out of the Bible. &quot;

This is one of three plays Shaw published as &quot;Plays Unpleasant&quot; in 1898. They were termed &quot;unpleasant&quot; because they were intended, not to entertain their audiences – as traditional Victorian theatre was expected to – but to raise awareness of social problems and to censure exploitation of the labouring class by the unproductive rich. The other plays in the group are &quot;The Philanderer&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;.

==Production history==
The play was first performed at the Royalty Theatre by the Independent Theatre Society on 9 December 1892. The lead role was taken by W. J. Robertson.

The play was performed in March 1907 in New York at the Herald Square Theatre.

It was performed at the Shaw Festival in 2003.

On 3 July 2011, a radio adaptation directed by Martin Jarvis was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 starring Ian McKellen as Sartorius, Charles Dance as William Cokane, Honeysuckle Weeks as Blanche, Dan Stevens as Harry Trench and Tim Pigott-Smith as Lickcheese.

It was performed in New York City at Theatre Row in March 2016 in a production with The Actors Company Theater and Gingold Theatrical Group. The production was directed by David Staller.

<doc id="951662" wikidata="Q331556" url="?curid=951662" title="Bosaso">
<text>Bosaso (, ), historically known as Bender Qassim is a city in the northeastern Bari province (&quot;gobol&quot;) of Somalia. It is the seat of the Bosaso District. Located on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden, the municipality serves as the region&#x27;s commercial capital and is a major seaport within the regional state of Puntland.

Bosaso had an estimated population of around 170,000 residents in 2013. More recent reports put the figure as high as 170,000. The city has a diverse economy centred on education, government, banking, tourism, aviation, food, clothes, logistics, steel, energy, health care, hospitality, retail and technology. The area&#x27;s many colleges and universities make it a regional hub of higher education, including law, medicine, engineering, business and entrepreneurship.

==History==

The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; indicates that Ancient Greek merchants sailed to Bosaso, providing notes about the strategic and geographical location of the current Bosaso area, which was known as Mosylon in ancient times. About hours&#x27; walk from Bet Qasim, we came to Bander Kasin (also called by the Arabs: the native name is Bosaso), which was built about sixty years ago. The Kaptallah was considered as first settlers. 
For centuries the city was among the areas ruled by Dishiishe clan. later forming a part of Italian Somaliland. The town would eventually be administered through the official Bari region in the post-independence period.

Bosaso&#x27;s population is estimated at 700,000 residents. It is the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargeisa. While Bosaso is a melting pot, with residents hailing from all the major clans of Somalia, most of its population is from the Harti confederation of Darod sub-clans.

Bosaso was previously known as Bandar Qasim, a name derived from a local trader of the same name who is said to have first settled in the area during the 14th century. It is believed that Qasim&#x27;s favourite camel was called Boosaas, from which derived the current name of the town. The town was thus first called Bandar Qassim after its founder (&quot;Qasim&#x27;s town&quot;), then later dubbed Bosaso after its founder&#x27;s trusted camel. Historically, Bosaso has been a Harti stronghold, and evolved as a coastal town.

Near Bosaso, at the end of the Baalade valley, lies a earthwork. Local tradition recounts that the massive embankment marks the grave of a community matriarch. It is the largest such structure in the wider Horn region.

==Geography==

===Location and habitat===
Bosaso is situated in northeastern Somalia, on the Gulf of Aden coast. Nearby settlements include to the east Rehiss (), to the northeast Marero (), to the west Baalade (), to the southwest Laas Geel (), to the south Lasgoriga (), and to the southeast El Dhurre (). The largest cities in the country most proximate to Bosaso are Erigavo (), Burao (), and Berbera (). Shimbiris, the highest peak in Somalia, is located some to the southwest in the Cal Madow mountain range.

In June 2014, the Puntland government launched a new tree-planting campaign in the state, with the regional Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism slated to plant 25,000 trees by the end of the year. Bosaso is among the seven cities and towns earmarked for the reforestation initiative, which also include Garowe, Qardho, Dhahar, Buuhoodle, Baran and Galkayo. The campaign is part of a broader partnership between the Puntland authorities and EU to set up various environmental protection measures in the region, with the aim of promoting reforestation and afforestation.

===Climate===
Bosaso has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). It has a mean annual relative humidity of around 60%. The average daily mean temperature year-round is , with an average annual high of and an average annual low of . Average low temperatures are coolest during the winter months of December to February, when thermometer readings typically level out at . The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average high temperatures later peak during the summer months of June to August, when they consistently exceed . Come September, cooler weather starts to set in again. Rainfall reaches a high over this period, with an average precipitation of in November. Total rainfall year-round is around .

==Demographics==

Bosaso&#x27;s total population is estimated at around 164,906 residents (2005 est.).

Furthermore, Bosaso is a major port for boats carrying emigrants from within the country as well as adjacent territories across the Gulf of Aden to settle (sometimes illegally) in the Persian Gulf states.

While Bosaso today is a melting pot, with residents hailing from many different parts of Somalia, most of the city&#x27;s population is from Dishiishe, Majeerteen, Warsangeli and other Harti groups of Darod. The city is also home to newly arrived IDPs.

Bosaso city affairs are managed by the Bosaso Municipality, its leadership is appointed by members of the area&#x27;s 29 District Councilors. The municipal authority is currently led by Mayor Abdisalam Bashiir Abdisalam who succeeded Yasin Mire Mohamud who himself succeeded Hassan Abdallah Hassan in office.

Each of the city&#x27;s various districts also has its own municipal sub-authorities, complete with a mayor and civil servants.

==Economy==
Bosaso is a city that is experiencing rapid growth. Prior to the Somali civil war, it had a population of under 50,000 inhabitants. Since the conflict, Somalis belonging to the Harti Darod sub-clans began migrating back to their ancestral areas of Puntland. As a consequence of these migrations, Bosaso&#x27;s population and the local housing industry have grown tremendously.
In December 2011, a new commercial market opened in Bosaso&#x27;s northern Dayaha (&quot;Star&quot;) neighborhood, near the port. Approximately in size, it was designed to ensure easy vehicle access. The market is the result of careful planning between Puntland government officials and civil society representatives. In September 2013, Puntland Minister of Fisheries Mohamed Farah Adan also announced that the Ministry in conjunction with the FAO would open a new fish market in the city, complete with modern refrigerators.

Bosaso is home to Golis Telecom Somalia, the largest telecommunications operator in northeastern Somalia. Founded in 2002 with the objective of supplying the country with GSM mobile services, fixed line and internet services, it has an extensive network that covers all of the nation&#x27;s major cities and more than 40 districts in both Puntland and Somaliland. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Golis offers one of the cheapest international calling rates on the planet, at US$0.2 less than anywhere else in the world. In addition, Netco has its headquarters in the city. Other telecommunication firms serving the region include Telcom and NationLink.

In September 2013, Puntland Deputy Minister of Environment Burhan Elmi Hirsi also announced a plan by the Puntland government to establish a gas manufacturing plant in Bosaso. The new project is part of a broader campaign by the Puntland environmental authorities to avert deforestation and promote alternative sources of fuel.
The Hafun Fishing Company was established in 1992 in Bosaso. It was named after the northeastern port town of Hafun, where HFC also has an office. The firm exports a wide range of fish products, which it mainly sends to partners in the Middle East. The company is exploring additional global markets for its fish goods. It also maintains commercial interests in Puntland&#x27;s housing market, which are represented by the firm&#x27;s growing local real estate sales and development division.

Additionally, the Bosaso Tannery is based in the city. A ten-year-old manufacturing, distributing, wholesale and import/export company, it processes wet salted, dry salted, wet blue, limed, pickled, and air/frame dried sheep and goat hides and skin. Principle wet blue exports are to Turkey, Pakistan, India and China. Raw camel hides and sheep and goat skin are also exported to the United Arab Emirates.

Commercial banks serving Bosaso include Amal Bank and Salaam Bank. Salaam Bank provides personal banking and corporate banking services. Its Islamic banking services and facilities include Mudarabah, Murabaha, Musharakah and Istisnaa. Additionally, the bank offers electronic banking, SMS banking, mobile banking and internet debit. In August 2011, the bank also launched an independent (Kaaftoon) service partnering with Golis Telecom Somalia.

==Transportation==

Bosaso is traversed by a north–south highway. It connects major cities in the northern part of the country, such as Galkayo and Garowe, with towns in the south. In June 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority (PHA) launched an upgrade and repair project on the large thoroughfare between Bosaso and Garowe. The transportation body also began rehabilitation work in October 2012 on the central artery linking the city with Qardho. Additionally, plans are in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main highway. In June 2014, Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali along with Bosaso Mayor Hassan Abdallah Hassan and other state officials also inaugurated a new paved road in the city. The construction project leads to the Bosaso seaport, and was completed in conjunction with UNHABITAT. According to Ali, his administration plans to invest at least 23 million Euros in contributions from international partners in similar road infrastructure development initiatives.

The city has a major seaport, the Port of Bosaso. It was constructed during the mid-1980s by the Siad Barre administration for annual livestock shipments to the Middle East. In January 2012, a renovation project was launched, with KMC contracted to upgrade the Bosaso Port&#x27;s harbor. The initiative&#x27;s first phase saw the clean-up of unwanted materials from the dockyard and was completed within the month. The second phase involves the reconstruction of the port&#x27;s adjoining seabed, with the objective of accommodating larger ships.

Besides its busy seaport, Bosaso has a major airport, the Bender Qassim International Airport. In 2008, the Puntland government signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Dubai&#x27;s Lootah Group, a regional industrial group operating in the Middle East and Africa. According to the agreement, the first phase of the investment is worth Dhs170m ($46.28m) and will see a set of new companies established to operate, manage and build Bosaso&#x27;s free trade zone and sea and airport facilities. The Bosaso Airport Company is slated to develop the airport complex to meet international standards, including a new runway, main and auxiliary buildings, taxi and apron areas, and security perimeters. In December 2014, the foundation stone for a new runway was also laid at the airport. The China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation is now slated to upgrade the airport&#x27;s existing gravel runway, pave it with asphalt, and convert it from in accordance with the code 4C operations clause.

==Education==

Bosaso has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 74 primary schools in the Bosaso District. Among these are the Iftin School, Alfurqan, Umul-Qura and Garisa. Secondary schools in the area include Hamdan, Shafi&#x27;i, Ughaz Yasin, Najah, Bosaso and Haji Yasin.

Tertiary education is provided by Bosaso College (BC), as well as the Puntland Nursing Institute (PNI). East Africa University (EAU) also has a Bosaso branch, one of its seven campuses in Puntland. Additionally, the Sam Greathouse School of Modern Technology (SG-SMT) has been working with the local government to construct a large scale dial-up network linking Bosaso to other northern Somali cities, including Berbera and Las Anod.

<text>David Kandel (1520–1592) was a Renaissance artist and one of the pioneers of botanical and natural history illustration. Very little is known of his personal life. 

==Biography==
He was probably born in Strasbourg, in 1520. He married in 1554 and 33 years later, in 1587, was recorded as &quot;owner of a house&quot;. He died in 1592. His works and woodcuts are diverse in subject, from botanical illustrations to biblical events.

The &quot;Kreuterbuch&quot; (or “The Book of the Herbs”), by Hieronymus Bock, used woodcuts of a quality far ahead of the time. Commissioned by Bock, Kandel contributed some 550 woodcuts to the second edition published in 1546. 

The woodcut “Rhinoceros”, for the work &quot;Cosmographia&quot; (or “Cosmography”) by Sebastian Munster, is based on the Dürer sketch.

<doc id="951664" wikidata="Q866345" url="?curid=951664" title="Grand Bahama">
<text>Grand Bahama is the northernmost of the islands of The Bahamas. It is the third largest island in The Bahamas island chain of approximately 700 islands and 2,400 cays. The island is roughly in area and approximately long west to east and at its widest point north to south. Its westernmost town, West End, is located east of Palm Beach, Florida. Administratively, the island consists of the Freeport Bonded Area and the districts of East Grand Bahama and West Grand Bahama. Nearly half of the homes on the island were damaged or destroyed in early September 2019 by Hurricane Dorian.

== Climate ==
Grand Bahama Island has a tropical monsoon climate, consisting of a hot, rainy season from May through October, and a warm, dry season from November through April.

In Freeport, the summer high temperatures average , and low temperatures average . During the winter, the average high temperature is , and the average low is . The hurricane season lasts from June through November, but the risk of hurricanes is highest during the months of August, September, and October.

==History==

===Early Spanish contact===
The Indigenous Lucayan people&#x27;s name for the island was &quot;&quot; (&#x27;large upper middle island&#x27;). Grand Bahama&#x27;s existence for almost two centuries was largely governed by the nature of the treacherous coral reefs surrounding the island, which repelled its Spanish claimants (who largely left it alone apart from infrequent en route stops by ships for provisions) while attracting pirates, who would lure ships onto the reefs where they would run aground and be plundered. The Spaniards took little interest in the island after enslaving the native Lucayan inhabitants.

===British rule===
In 1670, Charles II of England issued a land patent, granting The Bahamas to the eight Lords Proprietors of the Carolinas. By 1828, Grand Bahama remained almost unpopulated.

A brief smuggling boom occurred during the years of prohibition in the United States, when West End, Grand Bahama, and Bimini served as waystations for illicit imports of liquor to the U.S.
The first major resort and the first commercial airport on Grand Bahama was developed at West End in the late 1940s by the British Butlin&#x27;s firm, which constructed a 1000-guest resort from scratch, including building West End Airport. Butlin&#x27;s ran the partially-completed facility for a single season (1950) before running out of money. A small part of the resort re-opened in the 1955 and more fundamental redevelopment occurred in 1960. West End Airport remained the main commercial airport for Grand Bahama until overshadowed by the newer airport at Freeport in the 1960s.

The major settlement that developed on the island was Freeport-Lucaya, but other hamlets and settlements emerged, including Russell Town, Williams Town, Smith&#x27;s Point, Mather Town, Pinder&#x27;s Point, Lewis Yard, Hunter&#x27;s, and Mack Town.

===Hawksbill Creek Agreement era===

By the mid-20th century, Grand Bahama&#x27;s population numbered around 500 and the island was one of the least developed of the islands of The Bahamas. However it finally gained a stable source of income when in 1955 a Virginian financier named Wallace Groves began redevelopment with the Bahamian government to build the city of Freeport under the Hawksbill Creek Agreement and create the Grand Bahama Port Authority. Soon after, the ambitious Edward St. George, with the financial help of Sir Jack Hayward, took the company to new frontiers. Seeing the success of Cuba as a tourist destination for wealthy Americans, St. George was eager to develop Grand Bahama in a similar vein. The city grew rapidly as St. George added a harbour, an airport soon after the city was founded, and the tourist center of Port Lucaya in 1962. Grand Bahama became the second most populous island in The Bahamas (over 50,000 in 2004).

===Hurricane Dorian effects===

On September 1, 2019, Hurricane Dorian struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane and caused catastrophic destruction.

==Economy==

Exports and imports are essential to the economy of The Bahamas. The country is the 137th largest exporter and 117th largest importer in the world. Its major trading partners include the United States, France, and Finland. Top exports include passenger cargo ships, special purpose ships, and refined petroleum. Freeport, a city in Grand Bahama, has some industries that directly contribute to The Bahamas&#x27; exports. These major industries are pharmaceutical plants, the Fragrance of The Bahamas perfume factory, an oil transshipment company, and an immunology research center. Agriculture and fisheries are also economically important. Bahamian farms produce crops, poultry, livestock, and dairy. On commercial farms in Grand Bahama, vegetables and citrus fruits are produced and exported to other countries. From Bahamian fisheries, crayfish and conch are the top exports.

Even more than the production of goods, tourism is the mainstay of Grand Bahama&#x27;s economy. The resort area at Port Lucaya and visits by cruise ships provide the bulk of this activity. Grand Bahama&#x27;s tourism sector is directly supported by some of its industry: the BORCO oil bunkering facility owned by Buckeye, the South Riding Point oil storage and transhipment terminal owned by Statoil, and a transshipment/container port partly owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa and the Grand Bahama Port Authority. There are also quarrying operations and a large shipyard on the island.

Grand Bahama has two airports, Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport and West End Airport in West End. Grand Bahama International Airport is the larger of the two, and West End Airport is open sporadically for private aircraft only.

== Administrative regions ==

Grand Bahama is divided into three districts and seven town areas for administrative purposes. Each district is run by a chief councilor, and each town area or township is run by a chairperson. As of 1996 Grand Bahama has three districts:

*East Grand Bahama
*West Grand Bahama
*The City of Freeport

Elections are held every 5 years in The Bahamas. The two principal parties are the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement.. Grand Bahama also is a part of the islands outside of New Providence and operate under Local Government; this allows for a greater allowance for people to have a more direct rule. The intention of Local government is to not have direct connections to any political party.

==Main settlements==

*Freeport is the main city of Grand Bahama. It holds the commercial ship harbour and the main airport.
*Lucaya is a tourist destination on the island, with beaches and hotels.
*West End is the capital of Grand Bahama. It first achieved notoriety as a rum-running port during the Prohibition.
:In the 1950s, West End became home to the Jack Tar marina and club. However, over the years the marina fell into disrepair, and the whole city of West End was of little economic import to Grand Bahama. In 2001, the resort was reopened as &quot;Old Bahama Bay Resort &amp; Yacht Harbour&quot;.
*Eight Mile Rock stretches out over eight miles of rocky shore, hence its name. It is home to Bahamian NBA and WNBA players, Buddy Hield and Jonquel Jones.
*McLean&#x27;s Town is the easternmost settlement of Grand Bahama. It is within a 30-minute ferry ride of the northernmost settlement, the neighboring island of Abaco.
== Flora and fauna ==
Grand Bahama Island is populated with a variety of plants, birds, mammals and fish.

The Bahamas is home to many different species of bats, including the buffy flower bat, whose hair is white and brown. As the name suggests, it has a flowery nose that helps pollinate flowers and is usually found in dark caves or abandoned homes.

The Bahama woodstar is a non-migratory hummingbird found in brushy habitats, including forest and undergrowth, areas of low-growing, and scrubby vegetation.

The Bahama swallow is a medium-sized bird native to The Bahamas. This endangered bird breeds in the islands&#x27; pine woodland, but is threatened due to human development. This swallow has a green head and back, blue wings with a black tail, and a white belly and chin.

The tiger shark is a species that gets its name from the vertical stripes that line its body. They are often found near canals, harbours and shallow reefs of Grand Bahama Island.

The yellow elder is a shrub native to The Bahamas. It is densely branched with bright green leaves and yellow flowers that usually attract butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.

The casuarina is an invasive species to The Bahamas. It is a flowering shrub or tree with fine leaves that can grow to a height of 65 feet. The casuarina is common along the islands&#x27; shorelines, due to its salt-tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils.

<doc id="951665" wikidata="Q193733" url="?curid=951665" title="Beslan school siege">
<text>The Beslan school siege, also referred to as the Beslan school hostage crisis or the Beslan massacre, was an Islamic terrorist attack that started on 1 September 2004. It lasted three days, and involved the imprisonment of more than 1,100 people as hostages, including 777 children, ending with the deaths of 334 people, 186 of them children, as well as 31 of the attackers. It is considered the deadliest school shooting in history.

The crisis began when a group of armed terrorists occupied School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia (an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of Russia), on 1 September 2004. The hostage-takers were members of the Riyad-us Saliheen, sent by the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded Russia withdraw from and recognize the independence of Chechnya. On the third day of the standoff, Russian security forces stormed the building.

The event had security and political repercussions in Russia, leading to a series of federal government reforms consolidating power in the Kremlin and strengthening the powers of the President of Russia. Criticisms of the Russian government&#x27;s management of the crisis have persisted, including allegations of disinformation and censorship in news media as well as questions about journalistic freedom, negotiations with the terrorists, allocation of responsibility for the eventual outcome and the use of excessive force.

==Background==
School No. 1 was one of seven schools in Beslan, a town of about 35,000 people in the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania in Russia&#x27;s Caucasus. The school, located next to the district police station, housed approximately 60 teachers and more than 800 students. Its gymnasium, where most of the hostages were held for 52 hours, was a recent addition, measuring wide and long. There were reports that men disguised as repairmen had smuggled weapons and explosives into the school during July 2004, a fact that the authorities later denied; however, several witnesses have since testified they were forced to help their captors remove the weapons from caches hidden in the school. There were also claims that a &quot;sniper&#x27;s nest&quot; on the sports-hall roof had been set up in advance.

==Course of the crisis==
===Day one===
The attack on the school took place on 1 September, the traditional start of the Russian school year, referred to as &quot;First Bell&quot; or Knowledge Day. On this day, children, accompanied by their parents and other relatives, attend ceremonies hosted by their school. Because of the Knowledge Day festivities, the number of people in the schools was considerably higher than normal. Early in the morning, a group of several dozen heavily armed Islamic nationalist guerrillas left a forest encampment located in the vicinity of the village of Psedakh in the neighbouring Republic of Ingushetia, east of North Ossetia and west of war-torn Chechnya. The terrorists wore green military camouflage and black balaclava masks, and in some cases were also wearing explosive belts and explosive underwear. On the way to Beslan, on a country road near the North Ossetian village of Khurikau, they captured an Ingush police officer, Major Sultan Gurazhev. Gurazhev was left in a vehicle after the terrorists had reached Beslan and then ran toward the schoolyard and went to the district police department to inform them of the situation, adding that his duty handgun and badge had been taken.

At 09:11 local time, the terrorists arrived at Beslan in a GAZelle police van and a GAZ-66 military truck. Many witnesses and independent experts claim that there were two groups of attackers, and that the first group was already at the school when the second group arrived by truck. At first, some at the school mistook the militants for Russian special forces practicing a security drill. However, the attackers soon began shooting in the air and forcing everyone from the school grounds into the building. During the initial chaos, up to 50 people managed to flee and alert authorities about the situation. A number of people also managed to hide in the boiler room. After an exchange of gunfire against the police and an armed local civilian, in which reportedly one attacker was killed and two were wounded, the militants seized the school building. Reports of the death toll from this shootout ranged from two to eight people, while more than a dozen people were injured.

The attackers took approximately 1,100 hostages. The number of hostages was initially downplayed by the government to the 200–400 range, and then for an unknown reason announced to be exactly 354. In 2005, the government&#x27;s total was put at 1,128. The militants herded their captives into the school&#x27;s gym and confiscated all of their mobile phones under threat of death. They ordered the hostages to speak in Russian and only when first spoken to. When a father named Ruslan Betrozov stood to calm people and repeated the rules in the local language of Ossetic, a gunman approached him, asked Betrozov if he was done, and then shot him in the head. Another father named Vadim Bolloyev, who refused to kneel, was also shot by a captor and then bled to death. Their bodies were dragged from the sports hall, leaving a trail of blood later visible in the video made by the terrorists.

After gathering the hostages in the gym, the attackers singled out 15–20 adults who they thought were the strongest among the male teachers, school employees and fathers, and took them into a corridor next to the cafeteria on the second floor, where an explosive belt on one of the female bombers detonated, killing another female bomber (it was also claimed the second woman died from a bullet wound) and several of the selected hostages, as well as mortally injuring one male terrorist. The surviving hostages from this group were then ordered to lie down and were shot with an automatic rifle by another gunman; all but one of them were killed. Karen Mdinaradze, the FC Alania team cameraman, survived the explosion as well as the shooting; when discovered to be still alive, he was allowed to return to the sports hall, where he lost consciousness. The militants then forced other hostages to throw the bodies out of the building and to wash the blood off the floor. One of these hostages, Aslan Kudzayev, escaped by jumping out of the window; the authorities briefly detained him as a suspected terrorist.

====Beginning of the siege====
A security cordon was soon established around the school, consisting of the Russian police (&quot;militsiya&quot;), Internal Troops, Russian Army forces, Spetsnaz (including the elite &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Vympel&quot; units of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)), and the OMON special units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). A line of three apartment buildings facing the school gym was evacuated and taken over by the special forces. The perimeter that they made was within of the school, inside the range of the militants&#x27; grenade launchers. No firefighting equipment was in position and, despite the previous experiences of the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis, there were few ambulances ready. The chaos was worsened by the presence of Ossetian volunteer militiamen (&quot;opolchentsy&quot;) and armed civilians among the crowds who had gathered at the scene, altogether totaling perhaps as many as 5,000.

The attackers mined the gym and the rest of the building with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and surrounded it with tripwires. In a further bid to deter rescue attempts, they threatened to kill 50 hostages for every one of their own members killed by the police, and to kill 20 hostages for every gunman injured. They also threatened to blow up the school if government forces attacked. To avoid being overwhelmed by a gas attack as were their comrades in the 2002 Moscow hostage crisis, insurgents quickly smashed the school&#x27;s windows. The captors prevented hostages from eating and drinking (calling this a &quot;hunger strike&quot;) until North Ossetia&#x27;s president Alexander Dzasokhov would arrive to negotiate with them. However, the FSB set up its own crisis headquarters from which Dzasokhov was excluded, and threatened to arrest him if he tried to go to the school.

The Russian government announced that it would not use force to rescue the hostages, and negotiations toward a peaceful resolution took place on the first and second days, at first led by Leonid Roshal, a pediatrician whom the hostage-takers had reportedly requested by name. Roshal had helped negotiate the release of children in the 2002 Moscow siege, but had also given advice to the Russian security services as they prepared to storm the theatre, for which he received the Hero of Russia award; however, a witness statement indicated that the Russian negotiators confused Roshal with Vladimir Rushailo, a Russian security official. According to State Duma member Yuri Savelyev&#x27;s report, the official (&quot;civilian&quot;) headquarters sought a peaceful resolution while the secret (&quot;heavy&quot;) headquarters set up by the FSB was preparing the assault. Savelyev wrote that, in many ways, the &quot;heavies&quot; restricted the actions of the &quot;civilians&quot;, in particular in their attempts to negotiate with the militants.

At Russia&#x27;s request, a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council was convened on the evening of 1 September 2004, at which the council members demanded &quot;the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages of the terrorist attack.&quot; U.S. president George W. Bush made a statement offering &quot;support in any form&quot; to Russia.

===Day two===
On 2 September 2004, negotiations between Roshal and the militants proved unsuccessful, and they refused to allow food, water or medicine to be taken in for the hostages or for the dead bodies to be removed from the front of the school. At noon, FSB First Deputy Director Colonel General Vladimir Pronichev showed Dzasokhov a decree signed by prime minister Mikhail Fradkov appointing the North Ossetian FSB chief, Major General Valery Andreyev, as head of the operational headquarters. However, in April 2005 a &quot;Moscow News&quot; journalist received photocopies of the interview protocols of Dzasokhov and Andreyev by investigators, revealing that two headquarters had been formed in Beslan: a formal one, upon which was laid all responsibility, and a secret one (&quot;heavies&quot;), which made the real decisions, and at which Andreyev had never been in charge.

The Russian government downplayed the numbers, repeatedly stating there were only 354 hostages; this reportedly angered the hostage-takers, who further mistreated their captives. Several officials also said there appeared to be only 15 to 20 militants in the school. The crisis was met with a near-total silence from President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the rest of Russia&#x27;s political leaders. Only on the second day did Putin make his first public comment on the siege during a meeting in Moscow with King Abdullah II of Jordan: &quot;Our main task, of course, is to save the lives and health of those who became hostages. All actions by our forces involved in rescuing the hostages will be dedicated exclusively to this task.&quot; It was the only public statement by Putin about the crisis until one day after it ended. In protest, several people at the scene raised signs reading: &quot;Putin! Release our children! Meet their demands!&quot; and &quot;Putin! There are at least 800 hostages!&quot; The locals also said that they would not allow any storming or &quot;poisoning of their children&quot;, an allusion to the Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent.

In the afternoon, the gunmen allowed former president of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev to enter the school building and agreed to personally release to him 11 nursing women and all 15 babies. The women&#x27;s older children were left behind and one mother refused to leave, so Aushev carried out her youngest child instead. The terrorists gave Aushev a videotape made in the school and a note with demands from their purported leader, Shamil Basayev, who was not present in Beslan. The existence of the note was kept secret by Russian authorities, while the tape was declared as being empty (which was later proved incorrect). It was falsely announced that the militants had made no demands. In the note, Basayev demanded recognition of a &quot;formal independence for Chechnya&quot; in the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. He also said that although the Chechen separatists &quot;had played no part&quot; in the Russian apartment bombings of 1999, they would now publicly take responsibility for them if needed. Some Russian officials and state-controlled media later criticised Aushev for entering the school, accusing him of colluding with the terrorists.

The lack of food and water took a toll upon the young children, many of whom were forced to stand for long periods in the hot, tightly packed gym. Many children disrobed because of the sweltering heat in the gymnasium, which led to false rumors of sexual impropriety. Many children fainted, and parents feared that these children would die. Some hostages drank their own urine. Occasionally, the militants (many of whom took off their masks) took out some of the unconscious children and poured water on their heads before returning them to the sports hall. Later in the day, some adults also started to faint from fatigue and thirst. Because of the conditions in the gym, when the explosion and gun battle began on the third day, many of the surviving children were so fatigued that they were barely able to flee from the carnage.

Around 15:30, two grenades were detonated by the militants against security forces outside the school approximately ten minutes apart, setting a police car on fire and injuring one officer, but Russian forces did not return fire. As the day and night wore on, the combination of stress and sleep deprivation—and possibly drug withdrawal—made the hostage-takers increasingly hysterical and unpredictable. The crying of the children irritated them, and on several occasions crying children and their mothers were threatened that they would be shot if the crying did not cease. Russian authorities claimed that the terrorists had listened to German heavy metal group Rammstein on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves &quot;edgy and fired up&quot;. Rammstein had previously come under fire following the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, and again in 2007 after the Jokela High School shooting.

Overnight, a police officer was injured by shots fired from the school. Talks were broken off, resuming the next day.

===Day three===
Early on the third day, Ruslan Aushev, Alexander Dzasokhov, Taymuraz Mamsurov (North Ossetia&#x27;s parliament chairman) and First Deputy Chairman Izrail Totoonti together made contact with the president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Aslan Maskhadov. Totoonti said that both Maskhadov and his Western-based emissary Akhmed Zakayev declared that they were ready to fly to Beslan to negotiate with the militants, which was later confirmed by Zakayev. Totoonti said that Maskhadov&#x27;s sole demand was his unhindered passage to the school; however, the assault began one hour after the agreement for his arrival was made. He also mentioned that, for three days, journalists from Al Jazeera television offered to participate in the negotiations and enter the school, even as hostages, but were told &quot;their services were not needed by anyone.&quot;

Russian presidential advisor, former police general and ethnic Chechen Aslambek Aslakhanov was also said to be close to a breakthrough in the secret negotiations. By the time that he left Moscow on the second day, Aslakhanov had accumulated the names of more than 700 well-known Russian figures who were volunteering to enter the school as hostages in exchange for the release of the children. Aslakhanov said that the hostage-takers agreed to allow him to enter the school the next day at 15:00. However, the storming had begun two hours before.

====The first explosions and the fire in the gymnasium====

Around 13:00 on 3 September, the militants allowed four Ministry of Emergency Situations medical workers in two ambulances to remove 20 bodies from the school grounds, and to bring the corpse of the killed terrorist to the school. However, at 13:03, when the paramedics approached the school, an explosion in the gymnasium was heard. The terrorists then opened fire on the paramedics, killing two. The other two took cover behind their vehicle.

The second explosion, described as &quot;strange-sounding&quot;, was heard 22 seconds later. At 13:05, a fire started on the roof of the gymnasium, and soon the burning rafters and parts of the roof fell onto the hostages below, many of whom were injured but still alive. Eventually, the entire roof collapsed, filling the room with fire. The flames reportedly killed some 160 people, more than half of the total hostage fatalities.

There are several conflicting opinions regarding the source and nature of the explosions:

* According to the December 2005 report by Stanislav Kesayev, deputy speaker of the North Ossetian parliament, some witnesses said that a federal-forces sniper had shot a militant whose foot was on a dead man&#x27;s switch detonator, triggering the first blast. The captured terrorist Nur-Pashi Kulayev has testified to this, while a local policewoman and hostage named Fatima Dudiyeva said that she was shot in the hand &quot;from outside&quot; just before the explosion and that there were three blasts: two small explosions at 13:03 followed by a larger one at 13:29.
* According to the State Duma member Yuri Savelyev, a weapons and explosives expert, the exchange of gunfire did not begin with explosions inside the school building, but with two shots fired from outside the school and most of the homemade explosive devices installed by the terrorists did not explode at all. He said that the first shot was most likely fired from an RPO-A &quot;Shmel&quot; infantry rocket on the roof of the nearby five-story building at No. 37, School Lane, and aimed at the gymnasium&#x27;s attic, while the second was fired from an RPG-27 grenade launcher located at No. 41 on the same street, and destroyed part of the gym wall. Empty shells and launchers were found on the roofs of these houses, and alternative weapons mentioned in the report were RPG-26 or RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenades. Savelyev, a dissenting member of the federal commission headed by Aleksandr Torshin (see below), said that these explosions killed many of the hostages and that dozens more died in the resulting fire. Yuri Ivanov, another parliamentary investigator, further contended that the grenades were fired on the direct orders of President Putin. Several witnesses testified during the trial of Kulayev that the initial explosions were caused by projectiles fired from outside.
* In the final report, Aleksandr Torshin, head of the Russian parliamentary commission that concluded its work in December 2006, said that the militants had started the battle by intentionally detonating bombs among the hostages, to the surprise of Russian negotiators and commanders. This statement went beyond previous government accounts that mentioned that the bombs had exploded in an unexplained accident. Torshin&#x27;s 2006 report said that the taking of hostages was planned as a suicide attack from the beginning and that no storming of the building was prepared in advance. According to testimonies by Nur-Pashi Kulayev and several former hostages and negotiators, the militants (including their leaders) blamed the government for the ensuing explosions.

====Storming by Russian forces====
Part of the sports hall wall was demolished by the explosions, allowing some hostages to escape. The militants opened fire, and the military returned fire. A number of people were killed in the crossfire. Russian officials say that militants shot hostages as they ran and that the military fired back. The government asserted that once the shooting started, troops had no choice but to storm the building. However, some accounts by the town&#x27;s residents have contradicted this official version of events.

Police lieutenant colonel Elbrus Nogayev, whose wife and daughter died in the school, said, &quot;I heard a command saying, &#x27;Stop shooting! Stop shooting!&#x27; while other troops&#x27; radios said, &#x27;Attack!&#x27;&quot; As the fighting began, oil-company president and negotiator Mikhail Gutseriyev, an ethnic Ingush, phoned the hostage-takers and heard &quot;You tricked us!&quot; in response. Five hours later, Gutseriyev and his interlocutor reportedly had their last conversation, during which the man said, &quot;The blame is yours and the Kremlin&#x27;s.&quot;

According to Torshin, the order to start the operation was given by the head of the North Ossetian FSB, Valery Andreyev. However, statements by both Andreyev and Dzasokhov indicated that it was FSB deputy directors Vladimir Pronichev and Vladimir Anisimov who were actually in charge of the Beslan operation. General Andreyev also told North Ossetia&#x27;s Supreme Court that the decision to use heavy weapons during the assault was made by the head of the FSB&#x27;s Special Operations Center, Colonel General Aleksandr Tikhonov.

A chaotic battle broke out as the special forces fought to enter the school. The forces included the assault groups of the FSB and the associated troops of the Russian Army and the Russian Interior Ministry, supported by a number of T-72 tanks from Russia&#x27;s 58th Army (commandeered by Tikhonov from the military on 2 September), BTR-80 wheeled armoured personnel carriers and armed helicopters, including at least one Mi-24 attack helicopter. Many local civilians also joined the battle, having brought their own weapons, and at least one of the armed volunteers is known to have been killed. Alleged crime figure Aslan Gagiyev claimed to be among them. At the same time, regular conscripted soldiers reportedly fled the scene as the fighting began. Civilian witnesses claimed that the local police also panicked, sometimes firing in the wrong direction.

At least three, but as many as nine, powerful Shmel rockets were fired at the school from the special forces&#x27; positions (three or nine empty disposable tubes were later found on the rooftops of nearby apartment blocks). The use of the Shmel rockets, classified in Russia as flamethrowers and in the West as thermobaric weapons, was initially denied, but later admitted by the government. A report by an aide to the military prosecutor of the North Ossetian garrison stated that RPG-26 rocket-propelled grenades were used as well. The terrorists also used grenade launchers, firing at the Russian positions in the apartment buildings.

According to a military prosecutor, a BTR armoured vehicle drove close to the school and opened fire from its 14.5×114mm KPV heavy machine gun at the windows on the second floor. Eyewitnesses (among them Totoonti and Kesayev) and journalists saw two T-72 tanks advance on the school that afternoon, at least one of which fired its 125 mm main gun several times. Later during the trial, tank commander Viktor Kindeyev testified he provided tank to officer of FSB and around 21:00 tank fired &quot;one blank shot and six antipersonnel-high explosive shells&quot; on orders from the FSB. The use of tanks and armoured personnel carriers was eventually admitted to by Lieutenant General Viktor Sobolev, commander of the 58th Army. Another witness cited in the Kesayev report claims that he had jumped onto the turret of a tank in an attempt to prevent it from firing on the school. Scores of hostages were moved by the militants from the burning sports hall into other parts of the school, in particular the cafeteria, where they were forced to stand at windows as human shields. Many of them were shot by troops outside, according to the survivors (including Kudzeyeva, Kusrayeva and Naldikoyeva). Savelyev estimated that 106 to 110 hostages died after having been moved to the cafeteria.

By 15:00, two hours after the assault began, Russian troops claimed control of most of the school. However, fighting was still continuing on the grounds as evening fell, including resistance from a group of militants holding out in the school&#x27;s basement. During the battle, a group of some 13 militants broke through the military cordon and took refuge nearby. Several of them were believed to have entered a local two-story building, which was destroyed by tanks and flamethrowers around 21:00, according to the Ossetian committee&#x27;s findings (Kesayev Report). Another group of militants appeared to head back over the railway, chased by helicopters into the town.

Firefighters, who were called by Andreyev two hours after the fire had started, were not prepared to battle the blaze that raged in the gymnasium. One fire truck crew arrived after two hours on their own initiative, but with only of water, and were unable to connect to the nearby hydrants. The first water truck came at 15:28, nearly two and a half hours after the start of the fire; the second fire engine arrived at 15:43. Few ambulances were available to transport the hundreds of injured victims, who were mostly driven to the hospital in private cars. One suspected militant was reportedly lynched on the scene by a mob of civilians. An unarmed militant was captured alive by the OMON troops while trying to hide under a truck (he was later identified as Nur-Pashi Kulayev). Some of the dead insurgents appeared to have been mutilated by the commandos.

Sporadic explosions and gunfire continued during the night despite reports that all resistance by militants had been suppressed, until some 12 hours after the first explosions. Early the next day, Putin ordered the borders of North Ossetia closed while some of the terrorists were apparently still being pursued.

==Aftermath==
After the conclusion of the crisis, many of the injured died before patients were sent to better-equipped facilities in Vladikavkaz, as the only hospital in Beslan was unprepared to deal with the casualties. There was an inadequate supply of hospital beds, medication and neurosurgery equipment. Relatives were not allowed to visit hospitals where the wounded were treated, and doctors were not allowed to use their mobile phones.

The day after the storming, bulldozers gathered the debris of the building, including the body parts of the victims, and removed it to a garbage dump. The first of the many funerals was conducted on 4 September, the day after the final assault, with more following soon after, including a mass burial of 120 people. The local cemetery was too small and had to be expanded to an adjacent plot of land to accommodate the dead. Three days after the siege, 180 people were still missing. Many survivors remained severely traumatised and at least one female former hostage committed suicide after returning home, shortly after identifying the body of her child.

In his only visit to Beslan, Putin appeared during a hurried trip to the Beslan hospital in the early hours of 4 September to see several of the wounded victims. He was later criticised for not meeting the families of victims. After returning to Moscow, he ordered a two-day period of national mourning on 6 and 7 September. In his televised speech, Putin said: &quot;We showed ourselves to be weak. And the weak get beaten.&quot; On the second day of mourning, an estimated 135,000 people joined a government-organised rally against terrorism in Red Square in Moscow. In Saint Petersburg an estimated 40,000 people gathered in Palace Square.

Increased security measures were introduced to Russian cities after the crisis. More than 10,000 people without proper documents were detained by Moscow police in a &quot;terrorist hunt&quot;. Colonel Magomed Tolboyev, a cosmonaut and Hero of the Russian Federation, was attacked and brutally beaten by a Moscow police patrol because of his Chechen-sounding name. The Russian public appeared to generally support increased security measures; a 16 September 2004 Levada-Center opinion poll found 58% of Russians supporting stricter counterterrorism laws and the death penalty for terrorism, while 33% would support banning all Chechens from entering Russian cities.

===Long-term effects===
In the wake of Beslan, the government proceeded to toughen laws on terrorism and expand the powers of law-enforcement agencies.

In addition, Putin signed a law that replaced the direct election of the heads of the federal subjects of Russia with a system in which they are proposed by the president of Russia and approved or disapproved by the elected legislative bodies of the federal subjects. The election system for the Russian parliament was also repeatedly amended, eliminating the election of State Duma members by single-mandate districts. The Kremlin consolidated its control over the Russian media and increasingly attacked non-governmental organisations (especially those foreign-founded).

The raid on Beslan had more to do with the Ingush involved than with the Chechens, but it was highly symbolic for both regions. The Ossetes and Ingush have a conflict over ownership of the Prigorodny District that was inflamed by the 1944 Stalinist purges and the 1992–1993 ethnic cleansing of Ingush by Ossetes, with assistance from the Russian military. At the time of the raid, more than 40,000 Ingush refugees lived in tent camps in Ingushetia and Chechnya. The Beslan school itself had been used against the Ingush: in 1992, the gym was used as a pen to round up Ingush during the ethnic cleansing by the Ossetes. For the Chechens, the motive was revenge for the destruction of their homes and families; Beslan was one of the sites from which federal air raids were launched into Chechnya.

Upon learning that many children were killed by a terrorist group that included Chechens, many Chechens felt shame. A spokesman for Chechen independence cause stated: &quot;A bigger blow could not have been dealt on us ... People around the world will think that Chechens are beasts and monsters if they could attack children.&quot;

==Casualties==
By 7 September 2004, Russian officials stated that 334 people had died, including 156 children; at that point, 200 people remained missing or unidentified. The Torshin Report stated that ultimately no bodies remained unidentified. Locals stated that more than 200 of those killed were found with burns, and 100 or more of them were burned alive. In 2005, two hostages died from injuries sustained in the incident, as did a hostage in August 2006. A 33-year-old librarian, Yelena Avdonina, succumbed to a hematoma on 8 December 2006. At that time &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the death toll was 334, excluding terrorists. The city of Beslan states a death toll of 335 on its website. The death toll includes 186 children.

Russia&#x27;s Minister of Health and Social Reform Mikhail Zurabov said that the total number injured in the crisis exceeded 1,200. The exact number of people who received ambulatory assistance immediately after the crisis is not known, but is estimated to be around 700 (753 according to the U.N.). Moscow-based military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer concluded on 7 September 2004 that 90% of the surviving hostages had sustained injuries. At least 437 people, including 221 children, were hospitalised; 197 children were taken to the Children&#x27;s Republican Clinical Hospital in the North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz, and 30 were in cardiopulmonary resuscitation units in critical condition. Another 150 people were transferred to the Vladikavkaz Emergency Hospital. Sixty-two people, including 12 children, were treated in two local hospitals in Beslan, while six children with severe injuries were flown to Moscow for specialist treatment. The majority of the children were treated for burns, gunshot injuries, shrapnel wounds and mutilation caused by explosions. Some had limbs amputated and eyes removed, and many children were permanently disabled. One month after the attack, 240 people (160 of them children) were still being treated in hospitals in Vladikavkaz and Beslan. Surviving children and parents have received psychological treatment at Vladikavkaz Rehabilitation Centre.

One of the hostages, a physical education teacher called Yanis Kanidis (a Caucasus Greek, originally from Georgia) who was killed in the siege, saved the lives of many children. One of the new schools built in Beslan was subsequently named in his honour.

The operation also became the bloodiest in the history of the Russian anti-terrorist special forces. Ten members of the special forces died (7 Vympel and 3 Alpha members). A commando called Vyacheslav Bocharov was believed to have been killed, but proved to be seriously wounded in the face but alive when he regained consciousness and managed to write down his name.

The fatalities included all three commanders of the assault groups: Colonel Oleg Ilyin and Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Razumovsky of Vympel, and Major Alexander Perov of Alpha. At least 30 commandos suffered serious wounds.
==Identity of hostage-takers, motives, and responsibility==
===Responsibility===
Initially, the identity and origin of the attackers was unclear. It was widely assumed from Day Two that they were separatists from nearby Chechnya, though Putin&#x27;s Chechen aide Aslambek Aslakhanov denied it, saying &quot;they were not Chechens. When I started talking with them in Chechen, they had answered: &#x27;We do not understand; speak Russian. Freed hostages said that the hostage-takers spoke Russian with accents typical of Caucasians.

Though Putin had rarely hesitated to blame Chechen separatists for past acts of terrorism, he avoided linking the attack with the Second Chechen War. Instead, he blamed the crisis on the &quot;direct intervention of international terrorism&quot;, ignoring the nationalist roots of the crisis. Russian government sources initially claimed that nine of the militants in Beslan were Arabs and one was a black African (called &quot;a negro&quot; by Andreyev), though only two Arabs were later identified. Independent analysts such as Moscow political commentator Andrei Piontkovsky said that Putin tried to minimise the number and scale of Chechen terrorist attacks rather than exaggerate them as he had done in the past. Putin appeared to connect the events to the U.S.-led War on Terror, but at the same time accused the West of indulging terrorists.

On 17 September 2004, Chechen terrorist leader Shamil Basayev, operating autonomously from the rest of the North Caucasian terrorist movement, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the Beslan school siege, boasting that the siege only cost 8,000 euros. The event was strikingly similar to the Chechen raid on Budyonnovsk in 1995 and the Moscow theatre hostage crisis of 2002, incidents in which hundreds of Russian civilians were held hostage by Chechen terrorists led by Basayev. Basayev said that his Riyad-us Saliheen &quot;brigade of martyrs&quot; had carried out the attack and also claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist bombings in Russia in the weeks before the Beslan crisis. He said that he had originally planned to seize at least one school in either Moscow or Saint Petersburg, but lack of funds forced him to pick North Ossetia, &quot;the Russian garrison in the North Caucasus.&quot; Basayev blamed the Russian authorities for &quot;a terrible tragedy&quot; in Beslan. Basayev claimed that he had miscalculated the Kremlin&#x27;s determination to end the crisis by all means possible. He said he was &quot;cruelly mistaken&quot; and that he was &quot;not delighted by what happened there&quot;, but also added to be &quot;planning more Beslan-type operations in the future because we are forced to do so.&quot; However, it was the last major act of terrorism in Russia until 2009, as Basayev was soon persuaded to give up indiscriminate attacks by new Chechen leader Abdul-Halim Sadulayev, who made Basayev his second-in-command but banned hostage-taking, kidnapping for ransom and operations specifically targeting civilians.

Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov denied that his forces were involved in the siege, calling it &quot;a blasphemy&quot; for which &quot;there is no justification&quot;. Maskhadov described the perpetrators of Beslan as &quot;Madmen&quot; driven out of their senses by Russian acts of brutality. He condemned the action and all attacks against civilians via a statement issued by his envoy Akhmed Zakayev in London, blaming it on what he called a radical local group, and he agreed to the North Ossetian proposition to act as a negotiator. Later, he also called on western governments to initiate peace talks between Russia and Chechnya and added to &quot;categorically refute all accusations by the Russian government that President Maskhadov had any involvement in the Beslan event.&quot; Putin responded that he would not negotiate with &quot;child-killers&quot;, comparing the calls for negotiations with the appeasement of Hitler, and put a $10 million bounty on Maskhadov (the same amount as for Basayev). Maskhadov was killed by Russian commandos in Chechnya on 8 March 2005 and buried at an undisclosed location.

Shortly after the crisis, official Russian sources stated that the attackers were part of a supposed international group led by Basayev that included a number of Arabs with connections to al-Qaeda, and claimed that they had picked up phone calls in Arabic from the Beslan school to Saudi Arabia and another undisclosed Middle Eastern country.

Two British-Algerians, Osman Larussi and Yacine Benalia, were initially named as having actively participated in the attack. Another UK citizen called Kamel Rabat Bouralha, arrested while trying to leave Russia immediately following the attack, was suspected to be a key organiser. All three were linked to the Finsbury Park Mosque of North London. Allegations of al-Qaeda involvement were not repeated by the Russian government. Larussi and Benalia are not named in the Torshin Report and were never identified by Russian authorities as suspects in the Beslan attack.

The following people were named by the Russian government as planners and financiers of the attack:
* Shamil Basayev – Chechen terrorist leader who took ultimate responsibility for the attack. He died in Ingushetia in July 2006 in disputed circumstances.
* Kamel Rabat Bouralha – British-Algerian suspected of organizing the attack who was reportedly detained in Chechnya in September 2004.
* Abu Omar al-Saif – Saudi national and accused financer, killed in Dagestan in December 2005.
* Abu Zaid Al-Kuwaiti – Kuwaiti and accused organiser who died in Ingushetia in February 2005.

In November 2004, 28-year-old Akhmed Merzhoyev and 16-year-old Marina Korigova of Sagopshi, Ingushetia were arrested by Russian authorities in connection with the Beslan attack. Merzhoyev was charged with providing food and equipment to the terrorists, and Korigova was charged with having possession of a phone that Tsechoyev had phoned multiple times. Korigova was released when her defence attorney showed that she was given the phone by an acquaintance after the crisis.

===Motives and demands===
Russian negotiators say that the Beslan militants never explicitly stated their demands, although they did have notes handwritten by one of the hostages on a school notebook, in which they spelled out demands of full Russian troop withdrawal from Chechnya and recognition of Chechen independence.

The hostage-takers were reported to have made the following demands on 1 September 11:00–11:30 in a letter sent along with a hostage ER doctor:
* Recognition of the independence of Chechnya at the U.N. and withdrawal of Russian troops.
* Presence of the following people at the school: Aleksander Dzasokhov (president of North Ossetia), Murat Zyazikov (president of Ingushetia), Ruslan Aushev (former president of Ingushetia) and Leonid Roshal (a paediatrician). Alternatively, instead of Roshal and Aushev, the hostage-takers might have named Vladimir Rushailo and Alu Alkhanov (pro-Moscow president of Chechnya).

Dzasokhov and Zyazikov did not come to Beslan; Dzasokhov later claimed that he was forcibly stopped by &quot;a very high-ranking general from the Interior Ministry [who] said, &#x27;I have received orders to arrest you if you try to go&#x27;.&quot; The stated reason why Zyazikov did not arrive was that he had been &quot;sick&quot;. Aushev, Zyazikov&#x27;s predecessor at the post of Ingushetia&#x27;s president, who was forced to resign by Putin in 2002, entered the school and secured the release of 26 hostages.

Aslakhanov said that the hostage-takers also demanded the release of some 28 to 30 suspects detained in the crackdown following the terrorist raids in Ingushetia earlier in June.

Later, Basayev said the terrorists also demanded a letter of resignation from President Putin.

===Hostage-takers===
According to the official version of events, 32 militants participated directly in the seizure, one of whom was taken alive while the rest were killed on the spot. The number and identity of hostage-takers remains a controversial topic, fuelled by the often-contradictory government statements and official documents. The 3–4 September government statements said that a total of 26–27 militants were killed during the siege. At least four militants, including two women, died prior to the Russian storming of the school.

Many of the surviving hostages and eyewitnesses claim there were many more captors, some of whom may have escaped. It was also initially claimed that three terrorists were captured alive, including their leader Vladimir Khodov and a female militant. Witness testimonies during the Kulayev trial reported the presence of a number of apparently Slavic-, unaccented Russian- and &quot;perfect&quot; Ossetian-speaking individuals among the militants who were not seen among the bodies of those killed by Russian security forces. The unknown men (and a woman, according to one testimony) included a man with a red beard who was reportedly issuing orders to the kidnappers&#x27; leaders, and whom the hostages were forbidden to look at. He was possibly the militant known only as &quot;Fantomas&quot;, an ethnic Russian who served as a bodyguard to Shamil Basayev.

* The Kesayev Report (2005) estimated that about 50 terrorist fighters took part in the siege, based on witness accounts and the number of weapons left at the scene.
* The Savelyev Report (September 2006) said that there were between 58 and 76 militants, of which many managed to escape by slipping past the cordon around the school.
* The Torshin Report (December 2006) determined that 34 militants were involved, of whom 32 entered the school and 31 died there, and said that two accomplices remain at large (one of whom is Yunus Matsiyev, a bodyguard of Basayev).

According to Basayev (who called the attack &quot;Nord-West&quot; in allusion to Nord-Ost), &quot;Thirty-three mujahideen took part in Nord-West. Two of them were women. We prepared four [women] but I sent two of them to Moscow on August 24. They then boarded the two airplanes that blew up. In the group there were 12 Chechen men, two Chechen women, nine Ingush, three Russians, two Arabs, two Ossetians, one Tartar, one Kabardinian and one Guran &quot;

Basayev further said an FSB agent (Khodov) had been sent undercover to the terrorists to persuade them to carry out an attack on a target in North Ossetia&#x27;s capital, Vladikavkaz, and that the group was allowed to enter the region with ease because the FSB planned to capture them at their destination in Vladikavkaz. He also claimed that an unnamed hostage-taker had survived the siege and managed to escape.

====Identities====
On 6 September 2004, the names and identities of seven of the assailants became known, after forensic work over the weekend and interviews with surviving hostages and a captured assailant. The forensic tests also established that 21 of the hostage-takers took heroin, methamphetamine as well as morphine in a normally lethal amount; the investigation cited the use of drugs as a reason for the militants&#x27; ability to continue fighting despite being badly wounded and presumably in great pain. In November 2004, Russian officials announced that 27 of the 32 hostage-takers had been identified. However, in September 2005, the lead prosecutor against Nur-Pashi Kulayev stated that only 22 of the 32 bodies of the captors had been identified, leading to further confusion over which identities have been confirmed.

Most of the suspects, aged 20–35, were identified as Ingush or residents of Ingushetia (some of them Chechen refugees). At least five of the suspected hostage-takers were declared dead by Russian authorities before the seizure, while eight were known to have been previously arrested and then released, in some cases shortly before the Beslan attack.

; Male

The male hostage-takers were tentatively identified by the Russian government as:

* Ruslan Tagirovich Khuchbarov (32), nicknamed &quot;Polkovnik&quot; (Russian for &quot;Colonel&quot;) – An ethnic Ingush and native of Galashki, Ingushetia. Reputed group leader, disputed identity, possibly escaped and at large. Basayev identified him as &quot;Col. Orstkhoyev&quot;. Reportedly referred to by the other militants also as &quot;Ali&quot;, he led the negotiations on behalf of the hostage-takers. Initially reported to be Ali Taziyev, an Ingush policeman-turned-terrorist who was declared legally dead in 2000; but this was later refuted by the Russian prosecutors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beslan: Russia’s 9/11&quot;&gt;Beslan: Russia’s 9/11?, Peace in the Caucasus&lt;/ref&gt; During the negotiations, &quot;Ali&quot; had claimed his family was killed by the Russians in Chechnya. Investigators thought him to be Akhmed Yevloyev (&quot;Magas&quot;), an Ingush terrorist leader also known as Ali Taziyev, but those reports were also declared incorrect later. &quot;Magas&quot; was captured by the FSB in 2010.
* Vladimir Anatolievich Khodov (28), nicknamed &quot;Abdullah&quot; – An ethnic Ossetian-Ukrainian from the village of Elkhotovo in Kirovsky District of North Ossetia, Khodov was a former pupil of the Beslan SNO and one of the reputed leaders of the hostage-takers. Some of the survivors described him as the most frightening and aggressive of all the militants. Khodov converted to Islam while in prison for rape. He was officially wanted for a series of bomb attacks in Vladikavkaz, yet he lived openly in his hometown for over a month before the attack. Basayev claimed that Khodov was an FSB double agent code-named &quot;Putnik&quot; (&quot;Traveller&quot;), sent to infiltrate the terrorist movement.
* Iznaur Kodzoyev – An Ingush from Kantyshevo, Ingushetia, and father of five children. His cousin claimed he saw him in their home village on the second day of the siege. In August 2005 the Russian forces in Ingushetia killed a man identified as Iznaur Kodzoyev, who they said was one of hostage-takers, despite the fact that his body was identified among these killed in Beslan. Kodzoyev had been also previously announced by the Russians to be killed months before the Beslan crisis.
* Khizir-Ali Akhmedov (30) – Native of Bilto-Yurt, Chechnya.

==Official investigations and trials==
===Kulayev&#x27;s interrogation and trial===
The captured suspect, 24-year-old Nur-Pashi Kulayev, born in Chechnya, was identified by former hostages as one of the hostage-takers. The state-controlled Channel One showed fragments of Kulayev&#x27;s interrogation in which he said his group was led by a Chechnya-born man nicknamed &quot;Polkovnik&quot; and by the North Ossetia native Vladimir Khodov. According to Kulayev, &quot;Polkovnik&quot; shot another militant and detonated two female suicide bombers because they objected to capturing children.

In May 2005, Kulayev was a defendant in a court in the Republic of North Ossetia. He was charged with murder, terrorism, kidnapping, and other crimes and pleaded guilty on seven of the counts; many former hostages denounced the trial as a &quot;smoke screen&quot; and &quot;farce&quot;. Some of the relatives of the victims, who used the trial in their attempts to accuse the authorities, even called for a pardon for Kulayev so he could speak freely about what happened. The director of the FSB, Nikolai Patrushev, was summoned to give evidence, but he did not attend the trial. Ten days later, on 26 May 2006, Nur-Pashi Kulayev was sentenced to life imprisonment. Kulayev later disappeared in the Russian prison system. Following questions about whether Kulayev had been killed or died in prison, Russian government officials said in 2007 that he was alive and awaiting the start of his sentence.

===Investigation by federal prosecutors===
Family members of the victims of the attacks have accused the security forces of incompetence, and have demanded that authorities be held accountable. Putin personally promised to the Mothers of Beslan group to hold an &quot;objective investigation&quot;. On 26 December 2005, Russian prosecutors investigating the siege on the school declared that authorities had made no mistakes whatsoever.

===Torshin&#x27;s parliamentary commission===
At a press conference with foreign journalists on 6 September 2004, Vladimir Putin rejected the prospect of an open public inquiry, but cautiously agreed with an idea of a parliamentary investigation led by the State Duma, dominated by the pro-Kremlin parties.

In November 2004, the Interfax news agency reported Aleksandr Torshin, head of the parliamentary commission, as saying that there was evidence of involvement by &quot;a foreign intelligence agency&quot; (he declined to say which). On 22 December 2006, the Russian parliamentary commission ended their investigation into the incident. Their report concluded that the number of gunmen who stormed the school was 32 and laid much of the blame on the North Ossetian police, stating that there was a severe shortcoming in security measures, but also criticizing authorities for under-reporting the number of hostages involved. In addition, the commission said the attack on the school was premeditated by Chechen terrorist leadership, including the moderate leader Aslan Maskhadov. In another controversial move, the commission claimed that the shoot-out that ended the siege was instigated by the hostage-takers, not security forces. About the &quot;grounded&quot; decision to use flamethrowers, Torshin said that &quot;international law does not prohibit using them against terrorists.&quot; Ella Kesayeva, an activist who leads a Beslan support group, suggested that the report was meant as a signal that Putin and his circle were no longer interested in having a discussion about the crisis.

On 28 August 2006, Duma member Yuri Savelyev, a member of the federal parliamentary inquiry panel, publicised his own report which he said proves that Russian forces deliberately stormed the school using maximum force. According to Savelyev, a weapons and explosives expert, special forces fired rocket-propelled grenades without warning as a prelude to an armed assault, ignoring apparently ongoing negotiations. In February 2007, two members of the commission (Savelyev and Yuri Ivanov) denounced the investigation as a cover-up, and the Kremlin&#x27;s official version of events as fabricated. They refused to approve the Torshin&#x27;s report.

===Trials of the local police officials===
Three local policemen of the Pravoberezhny District ROVD (district militsiya unit) were the only officials put on trial over the massacre. They were charged with negligence in failing to stop gunmen seizing the school. On 30 May 2007, the Pravoberezhny Court&#x27;s judge granted an amnesty to them. In response, a group of dozens of local women rioted and ransacked the courtroom by smashing windows, overturning furniture, and tearing down a Russian flag. Victims&#x27; groups said the trial had been a whitewash designed to protect their superiors from blame. The victims of the siege said they would appeal against the court judgement.

In June 2007, a court in Kabardino-Balkaria charged two Malgobeksky District ROVD police officials, Mukhazhir Yevloyev and Akhmed Kotiyev, with negligence, accusing them of failing to prevent the attackers from setting up their training and staging camp in Ingushetia. The two pleaded innocent, and were acquitted in October 2007. The verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ingushetia in March 2008. The victims said they would appeal the decision to the European Court for Human Rights.

==Criticism of the Russian government==
===Allegations of incompetence and rights violations===
The handling of the siege by Vladimir Putin&#x27;s administration was criticised by a number of observers and grassroots organisations, amongst them Mothers of Beslan and Voice of Beslan. Soon after the crisis, the independent MP Vladimir Ryzhkov blamed &quot;the top leadership&quot; of Russia. Initially, the European Union also criticised the response.

Critics, including Beslan residents who survived the attack and relatives of the victims, focused on allegations that the storming of the school was ruthless. They cite the use of heavy weapons, such as tanks and Shmel rocket flamethrowers. Their usage was officially confirmed. The Shmel is a type of thermobaric weapon, described by a source associated with the US military as &quot;just about the most vicious weapon you can imagine – igniting the air, sucking the oxygen out of an enclosed area and creating a massive pressure wave crushing anything unfortunate enough to have lived through the conflagration.&quot; Pavel Felgenhauer has gone further and accused the government of also firing rockets from an Mi-24 attack helicopter, a claim that the authorities deny. Some human rights activists claim that at least 80% of the hostages were killed by indiscriminate Russian fire. According to Felgenhauer, &quot;It was not a hostage rescue operation ... but an army operation aimed at wiping out the terrorists.&quot; David Satter of the Hudson Institute said the incident &quot;presents a chilling portrait of the Russian leadership and its total disregard for human life&quot;.

The provincial government and police were criticised by the locals for having allowed the attack to take place, especially since police roadblocks on the way to Beslan were removed shortly before the attack. Many blamed rampant corruption that allowed the attackers to bribe their way through the checkpoints; in fact, this was even what they had openly boasted to their hostages. Others say the militants took the back roads used by smugglers in collusion with the police. Yulia Latynina alleged that Major Gurazhev was captured after he approached the militants&#x27; truck to demand a bribe for what he thought was an oil-smuggling operation. It was also alleged the federal police knew of the time and place of the planned attack; according to internal police documents obtained by &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, the Moscow MVD knew about the hostage taking four hours in advance, having learned this from a militant captured in Chechnya. According to Basayev, the road to Beslan was cleared of roadblocks because the FSB planned to ambush the group later, believing the terrorists&#x27; aim was to seize the parliament of North Ossetia in Vladikavkaz.

Critics also charged that the authorities did not organise the siege properly, including failing to keep the scene secure from entry by civilians, while the emergency services were not prepared during the 52 hours of the crisis. The Russian government has been also heavily criticised by many of the local people who, days and even months after the siege, did not know whether their children were alive or dead, as the hospitals were isolated from the outside world. Two months after the crisis, human remains and identity documents were found by a local driver, Muran Katsanov, in the garbage landfill at the outskirts of Beslan; the discovery prompted further outrage.

In addition, there were serious accusations that federal officials had not earnestly tried to negotiate with the hostage-takers (including the alleged threat from Moscow to arrest President Dzasokhov if he came to negotiate) and deliberately provided incorrect and inconsistent reports of the situation to the media.

====Independent reports====
The report by Yuri Savelyev, a dissenting parliamentary investigator and one of Russia&#x27;s leading rocket scientists, placed the responsibility for the final massacre on actions of the Russian forces and the highest-placed officials in the federal government. Savelyev&#x27;s 2006 report, devoting 280 pages to determining responsibility for the initial blast, concludes that the authorities decided to storm the school building, but wanted to create the impression they were acting in response to actions taken by the terrorists. Savelyev, the only expert on the physics of combustion on the commission, accused Torshin of &quot;deliberate falsification&quot;.

A separate public inquiry by the North Ossetian parliament (headed by Kesayev) concluded on 29 November 2005 that both local and federal law enforcement mishandled the situation.

====European Court complaint====
On 26 June 2007, 89 relatives of victims lodged a joint complaint against Russia with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The applicants say their rights were violated both during the hostage-taking and the trials that followed. The case was brought by over 400 Russians.

In an April 2017 judgement that supported the prosecutors, the court deemed that Russia&#x27;s failure to act on &quot;sufficient&quot; evidence about a likely attack on a North Ossetia school had violated the &quot;Right to Life&quot; guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. The court stated the error was made worse by the Russian use of &quot;indiscriminate force&quot;. Result were published in April 2017, and found that Russian actions in using tank cannons, flame-throwers and grenade launchers &quot;contributed to the casualties among the hostages&quot;, and had &quot;not been compatible with the requirement under Article 2 that lethal force be used &quot;no more than [is] absolutely necessary&quot;. The report also said that &quot;The authorities had been in possession of sufficiently specific information of a planned terrorist attack in the area, linked to an educational institution&quot;, &quot;nevertheless, not enough had been done to disrupt the terrorists meeting and preparing&quot;, or to warn schools or the public.

The ECHR court in Strasbourg ordered Russia to pay €2.9 million in damages and €88,000 in legal costs. The Court&#x27;s findings were rejected by the Russian Government. Although obligated to accept the ruling because it is a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Kremlin called the ruling &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot;. The Russian government challenged it in a higher chamber: it argued that several of the court&#x27;s conclusions were &quot;not backed up&quot;, but ultimately agreed to the ruling after the complaints were rejected by the Strasbourg-based court.

===Alleged threats, disinformation and suppression of information===
====Russian television reporting and false information====
In opposition to the coverage on foreign television news channels (such as CNN and the BBC), the crisis was not broadcast live by the three major state-owned Russian television networks. The two main state-owned broadcasters, Channel One and Rossiya, did not interrupt their regular programming following the school seizure. After explosions and gunfire started on the third day, NTV Russia shifted away from the scenes of mayhem to broadcast a World War II soap opera. According to the &quot;Ekho Moskvy&quot; (&quot;Echo of Moscow&quot;) radio station, 92% of the people polled said that Russian TV channels concealed parts of information.

Russian state-controlled television only reported official information about the number of hostages during the course of the crisis. The figure of 354 people was persistently given, initially reported by Lev Dzugayev (the press secretary of Dzasokhov) and Valery Andreyev (the chief of the republican FSB). It was later claimed that Dzugayev only disseminated information given to him by &quot;Russian presidential staff who were located in Beslan from 1 September&quot;. Torshin laid the blame squarely at Andreyev, for whom he reserved special scorn.

The deliberately false figure had grave consequences for the treatment of the hostages by their angered captors (the hostage-takers were reported saying, &quot;Maybe we should kill enough of you to get down to that number&quot;) and contributed to the declaration of a &quot;hunger strike&quot;. One inquiry has suggested that it may have prompted the militants to kill the group of male hostages shot on the first day. The government disinformation also sparked incidents of violence by the local residents, aware of the real numbers, against the members of Russian and foreign media.

On 8 September 2004, several leading Russian and international human-rights organisations – including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Memorial, and Moscow Helsinki Group – issued a joint statement in which they pointed out the responsibility that Russian authorities bore in disseminating false information:

We are also seriously concerned with the fact that authorities concealed the true scale of the crisis by, &quot;inter alia&quot;, misinforming Russian society about the number of hostages. We call on Russian authorities to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the circumstances of the Beslan events which should include an examination of how authorities informed the whole society and the families of the hostages. We call on making the results of such an investigation public.&quot;

The Moscow daily tabloid &quot;Moskovskij Komsomolets&quot; ran a rubric headlined &quot;Chronicle of Lies&quot;, detailing various initial reports put out by government officials about the hostage taking, which later turned out to be false.

====Incidents involving Russian and foreign journalists====
The late &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who had negotiated during the 2002 Moscow siege, was twice prevented by the authorities from boarding a flight. When she eventually succeeded, she fell into a coma after being poisoned aboard an aeroplane bound for Rostov-on-Don.

According to the report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), several correspondents were detained or otherwise harassed after arriving in Beslan (including Russians Anna Gorbatova and Oksana Semyonova from &quot;Novye Izvestia&quot;, Madina Shavlokhova from &quot;Moskovskij Komsomolets&quot;, Elena Milashina from &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, and Simon Ostrovskiy from &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;). Several foreign journalists were also briefly detained, including a group of journalists from the Polish &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, French &quot;Libération&quot;, and British &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Many foreign journalists were exposed to pressure from the security forces and materials were confiscated from TV crews ZDF and ARD (Germany), AP Television News (US), and Rustavi 2 (Georgia). The crew of Rustavi 2 was arrested; the Georgian Minister of Health said that the correspondent Nana Lezhava, who had been kept for five days in the Russian pre-trial detention centers, had been poisoned with dangerous psychotropic drugs (like Politkovskaya, Lezhava had passed out after being given a cup of tea). The crew from another Georgian TV channel, Mze, was expelled from Beslan.

Raf Shakirov, chief editor of the Russia&#x27;s leading newspaper, &quot;Izvestia&quot;, was forced to resign after criticism by the major shareholders of both style and content of the issue of 4 September 2004. In contrast to the less emotional coverage by other Russian newspapers, &quot;Izvestia&quot; had featured large pictures of dead or injured hostages. It also expressed doubts about the government&#x27;s version of events.

====Secret video materials====
The video tape made by the hostage-takers and given to Ruslan Aushev on the second day was declared by the officials as being &quot;blank&quot;. Aushev himself did not watch the tape before he handed it to government agents. A fragment of tape shot by the hostage-takers was shown on Russian NTV television several days after the crisis. Another fragment of a tape shot by the hostage-takers was acquired by media and publicised in January 2005.

In July 2007, the Mothers of Beslan asked the FSB to declassify video and audio archives on Beslan, saying there should be no secrets in the investigation. They did not receive any official answer to this request. However, the Mothers received an anonymous video, which they disclosed saying it might prove that the Russian security forces started the massacre by firing rocket-propelled grenades on the besieged building. The film had been kept secret by the authorities for nearly three years before being officially released by the Mothers on 4 September 2007. The graphic film apparently shows the prosecutors and military experts surveying the unexploded shrapnel-based bombs of the militants and structural damage in the school in Beslan shortly after the massacre. Footage shows a large hole in the wall of the sports hall, with a man saying, &quot;The hole in the wall is not from this [kind of] explosion. Apparently someone fired [there]&quot;, adding that many victims bear no sign of shrapnel wounds. In another scene filmed next morning, a uniformed investigator points out that most of the IEDs in the school actually did not go off, and then points out a hole in the floor which he calls a &quot;puncture of an explosive character&quot;.

===Government response===
In general, the criticism was rejected by the Russian government. President Vladimir Putin specifically dismissed the foreign criticism as Cold War mentality and said that the West wants to &quot;pull the strings so that Russia won&#x27;t raise its head.&quot;

The Russian government defended the use of tanks and other heavy weaponry, arguing that it was used only after surviving hostages escaped from the school. However, this contradicts the eyewitness accounts, including by the reporters and former hostages. According to the survivors and other witnesses, many hostages were seriously wounded and could not possibly escape by themselves, while others were kept by the terrorists as human shields and moved through the building.

Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia Nikolai Shepel, acting as deputy prosecutor at the trial of the sole surviving attacker, found no fault with the security forces in handling the siege, &quot;According to the conclusions of the investigation, the expert commission did not find any violations that could be responsible for the harmful consequences.&quot; Shepel acknowledged that commandos fired flamethrowers, but said this could not have sparked the fire that caused most of the deaths; he also said that the troops did not use napalm during the attack.

To address doubts, in 2005 Putin launched a Duma parliamentary investigation led by Aleksandr Torshin, resulting in the report which criticised the federal government only indirectly and instead put blame for &quot;a whole number of blunders and shortcomings&quot; on local authorities. The findings of the federal and the North Ossetian commissions differed widely in many main aspects.

In 2005, previously unreleased documents by the national commission in Moscow were made available to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. According to the paper, &quot;instead of calling for self-criticism in the wake of the disaster, the commission recommended the Russian government to crack down harder.&quot;

====Dismissals and trials====
Three local top officials resigned in the aftermath of the tragedy:
* North Ossetian Interior Minister Kazbek Dzantiyev resigned shortly after the crisis, saying that after what happened in Beslan, he &quot;[didn&#x27;t] have the right to occupy this post as an officer and a man.&quot;
* Valery Andreyev, the chief of the Ossetia&#x27;s FSB, also submitted his resignation soon after. However, he was later elevated to the prestigious position of Deputy Rector of FSB Academy.
* Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, resigned his post on 31 May 2005, after a series of demonstrations against him in Beslan and public pressure from Mothers of Beslan on Putin to have him dismissed.

Five Ossetian and Ingush police officers were tried in the local courts; all of them were subsequently amnestied or acquitted in 2007. As of December 2009, none of the Russian federal officials suffered consequences in connection with the Beslan events.

==Other incidents and controversies==
===Escalation of the Ingush-Ossetian hostility===
Nur-Pashi Kulayev, the sole survivor of the 32 attackers, claimed that attacking a school and targeting mothers and young children was not merely coincidental, but was deliberately designed for maximum outrage with the purpose of igniting a wider war in the Caucasus. According to Kulayev, the attackers hoped that the mostly Orthodox Ossetians would attack their mostly Muslim Ingush and Chechen neighbours to seek revenge, encouraging ethnic and religious hatred and strife throughout the North Caucasus. North Ossetia and Ingushetia had previously been involved in a brief but bloody conflict in 1992 over disputed land in the North Ossetian Prigorodny District, leaving up to 1,000 dead and some 40,000 to 60,000 displaced persons, mostly Ingush. Indeed, shortly after the Beslan massacre, 3,000 people demonstrated in Vladikavkaz calling for revenge against the ethnic Ingush.

The expected backlash against neighbouring nations failed to materialise on a massive scale. In one noted incident, a group of ethnic Ossetian soldiers led by a Russian officer detained two Chechen Spetsnaz soldiers and executed one of them. In July 2007, the office of the presidential envoy for the Southern Federal District Dmitry Kozak announced that a North Ossetian armed group engaged in abductions as retaliation for the Beslan school hostage-taking. FSB Lieutenant Colonel Alikhan Kalimatov, sent from Moscow to investigate these cases, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in September 2007.

===Grabovoy affair and the charges against Beslan activists===
In September 2005, the self-proclaimed faith healer and miracle-maker Grigory Grabovoy claimed he could resurrect the murdered children. Grabovoy was arrested and indicted of fraud in April 2006, amidst the accusations that he was being used by the government as a tool to discredit the Mothers of Beslan group.

In January 2008, the Voice of Beslan group, which in the previous year had been court-ordered to disband, was charged by Russian prosecutors with &quot;extremism&quot; for their appeals in 2005 to the European Parliament to help establish an international investigation. This was soon followed with other charges, some of them relating to the 2007 court incident. As of February 2008, the group was charged in total of four different criminal cases.

==Memorial==
Russian Patriarch Alexius II&#x27;s plans to build an Orthodox church as part of the Beslan monument caused a serious conflict between the Orthodox Church and the leadership of the Russian Muslims in 2007. Beslan victims organisations also spoke against the project, and many in Beslan want the ruins of the school to be preserved, opposing the government plan to demolish them.

==International response==
The attack at Beslan was met with international abhorrence and universal condemnation. Countries and charities around the world donated to funds set up to assist the families and children that were involved in the Beslan crisis.

At the end of 2004, the International Foundation For Terror Act Victims had raised over $1.2 million with a goal of $10 million. The Israeli government offered help in rehabilitating freed hostages, and during Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov&#x27;s visit to China in November 2005, the Chinese Health Ministry announced that they were sending doctors to Beslan, and offered free medical care to any of the victims who still needed treatment. The then mayor of Croatia&#x27;s capital Zagreb, Vlasta Pavić, offered free vacations to the Adriatic Sea to the Beslan children.

On 1 September 2005, UNICEF marked the first anniversary of the Beslan school tragedy by calling on all adults to shield children from war and conflict.

Maria Sharapova and many other female Russian tennis players wore black ribbons during the 2004 US Open in memory of the tragedy.

In August 2005, two new schools were built in Beslan, paid for by the Moscow government.

<text>Vladimir Vladimirovich Pozner (; born 1 April 1934) is a French-born Russian-American journalist and presenter.

He is best known in the West for his television appearances representing and explaining the views of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He was memorable as a spokesman for the Soviets, in part because he grew up in the United States and speaks fluent English, Russian, and French. Pozner later described his role as propaganda.

After the Cold War, Pozner moved to the United States to work with Phil Donahue, before returning to Moscow to continue working as a television journalist. From 2008 until 2022, he hosted the eponymous show &quot;Pozner&quot; on Russia&#x27;s Channel One where he interviewed public figures.

==Early life and education==
Vladimir Pozner was born in Paris on 1 April 1934, to a Russian Jewish father, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Pozner, and a French Catholic mother, Géraldine Lutten. The couple separated shortly after his birth. When Vladimir was 3 months old, he and his mother moved to New York City, where Géraldine&#x27;s mother and younger sister lived. In the spring of 1939 Pozner&#x27;s parents reunited and the family returned to Paris, France.

After the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of France the Pozners fled Paris in the fall of 1940, traveling via Marseille in the Free Zone, Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon, before sailing back to the US. The escape was partially financed by a Jewish family whose adult daughter traveled with the Pozners disguised as Vladimir&#x27;s nanny.

Back in New York, Vladimir attended Caroline Pratt&#x27;s City and Country School and later Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. Robert Hollander, an elementary school friend of Pozner, remembered him most vividly for &quot;his capacities for, one, having extraordinarily attractive fantasies and, two, for getting the rest of us to believe them.&quot;

In 1946, with the advent of what later came to be called McCarthyism, Pozner senior began to have serious problems with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, because of his pro-Soviet views and alleged cooperation with the Soviet intelligence services. The documents that conclusively proved the secret service connections of his father were published in 1996 in the United States, as part of the Venona project files&quot;.&quot;

As a result, the Pozners intended to return to France, but Pozner senior was refused a French visa after being denounced to the French Foreign Ministry as a &quot;subversive element&quot; and a spy. The family moved in 1948 to the Soviet sector of Berlin, where Pozner senior was offered a position with SovExportFilm, an international distributor of Soviet films. At one time Pozner junior claimed to have stayed behind in New York, attending Columbia College between 1950 and December 1953; however, there appears to be no record of him at Columbia. Currently he tells of attending a Russian military-style high school in Berlin run by the Soviet Military Administration during that time.

In 1952, the Pozner family moved to Moscow. In 1953 the younger Pozner enrolled at Moscow State University, Faculty of Biology and Soil Science, majoring in human physiology. He graduated in 1958.

==Career==
Pozner began his career as a &quot;journalist&quot; – unwittingly, by his own account – in a disinformation department of the KGB. In 1961 he was offered the position of senior editor with the English-language &quot;Soviet Life&quot; magazine. In 1967 he transferred to a sister publication, &quot;Sputnik&quot;, leaving it in February 1970 to take up a post with the State Television and Radio Committee, where he became a chief commentator and host of the propaganda radio program the &quot;Voice of Moscow&quot; on the North American service of Radio Moscow.

Beginning in the early 1970s, and until the early 1990s, Pozner was a regular guest on Ray Briem&#x27;s talk show on KABC in Los Angeles. During the 1980s, he was a favourite guest on Ted Koppel&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;. Pozner was the host of &quot;Moscow Meridian&quot;, an English-language current affairs program focusing on the Soviet Union; the show was produced by Gosteleradio, the Soviet State Committee for Television and Radio and broadcast on the Satellite Program Network. He also often appeared on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;.

In his Western media appearances Pozner was a charismatic and articulate apologist for some of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most controversial foreign and domestic policy decisions. He would frequently draw parallels and point out similarities between Soviet and Western policies as well as candidly admitting the existence of certain problems in the USSR. However, while stopping short of unequivocal endorsement and support, he nevertheless rationalized, among other events, the arrest and exiling of Andrei Sakharov, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, in his 1990 autobiography &quot;Parting with Illusions&quot;. Later, he wrote that some of the positions he had taken were wrong and immoral. In a 2005 interview with NPR&#x27;s &quot;On the Media&quot;, Pozner spoke openly about his role as a Soviet spokesman, stating bluntly, &quot;What I was doing was propaganda.&quot; Comparing his former role to that of Karen Hughes, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs under George W. Bush, he commented that, &quot;You know, as someone who&#x27;s gone through this and someone who regrets having done what he&#x27;s done, and who spent many, many years of his life, and I think probably the best years of my life, doing something that was wrong, I say it just isn&#x27;t worth it&quot;.

Despite his frequent appearances in the North American media and his near-celebrity status there as the principal spokesman for the Soviet Union, Pozner remained virtually unknown at home. This changed in the mid-1980s, when Pozner co-hosted several bilateral, televised discussions (or &quot;spacebridges&quot;) between audiences in the Soviet Union and the US, carried via satellite. These were initially produced with Helene Keyssar at the University of California, San Diego. They included &quot;Moscow Calling San Diego: Children and Film&quot; (with Mike Cole), &quot;Remembering War&quot; (May 7, 1985, with Fred Starr). Later programs included &quot;Citizens Summit I - Leningrad/Seattle&quot; (December 29, 1985) and &quot;Citizens Summit II: Women to Women - Leningrad/Boston&quot; (May 20, 1986) - both with Phil Donahue. The programs marked a dramatic turning point in Pozner&#x27;s career, garnering him instant renown and wide popularity and acclaim from domestic audiences in the USSR. Pozner also introduced Russian rock band Autograph for Live Aid. He was promoted to the position of &quot;political observer of Central Television&quot;, the highest journalistic rank at Gosteleradio, and started to work on programs that were broadcast domestically. However, in 1991 Pozner was asked to resign after being quoted voicing his support for Boris Yeltsin over Mikhail Gorbachev.

Later that year, Pozner received an offer to work with Phil Donahue and moved to the United States. From 1991 to 1994 they co-hosted &quot;Pozner/Donahue&quot;, a weekly, issues-oriented roundtable program, which was aired both on CNBC and in syndication. While living in New York, Pozner regularly commuted to Moscow to tape his programs that aired in Russia.

Pozner returned to Moscow in 1997, continuing his work as an independent television journalist. Later that year, he founded the School for Television Excellence («Школа телевизионного мастерства») in Moscow to educate and promote young journalists.

From its foundation in 1994 until 2008 Pozner was president of the Russian Television Academy, which annually awards the prestigious TEFI trophy. Pozner also worked for the Institute for US and Canadian Studies, a Soviet think tank.

Since 2004, Pozner and his brother Pavel have owned a French brasserie in Moscow, Жеральдин (Chez Géraldine), named after their mother.

==Shows==
For many years during the Cold War, Pozner delivered the nightly &quot;Radio Moscow News and Commentary&quot; program on the North America Service with his signature greeting, &quot;Thank you and good evening&quot;. Pozner was the host of several shows on Russian TV, among them the US-Soviet space bridges, &quot;Mi&quot; (translated &quot;Us&quot;), &quot;Vremya i Mi&quot; (&quot;The Time and Us&quot;), &quot;Voskresnyi Vecher s Vladimirom Poznerom&quot; (&quot;Sunday Night with Vladimir Pozner&quot;), &quot;Chelovek v maske&quot; (&quot;A Man in the Mask&quot;), &quot;Vremena&quot; (&quot;Times&quot;). Most of these followed a talk show format, with varying numbers of guests and varying degree and manner of audience participation.

Since 2004 Pozner has been contributing his time as the host of &quot;Vremya Zhit&#x27; !&quot; (&quot;A time to live!&quot;), a series of talk shows about the problem of HIV/AIDS. The programs are produced and broadcast by regional television stations and focus on addressing the local challenges that exist in different parts of Russia.

In the documentary film &quot;Lugovoy, pervy podozrevaemy&quot; (&quot;Lugovoy, the first suspected&quot;) about Andrey Lugovoy, suspected of being the killer of Aleksandr Litvinenko, Pozner makes important statements, such as his claim that KGB agents were taken for heroes in the Soviet Union, like James Bond in the UK.

In 2008 Pozner, together with Ivan Urgant and Brian Kahn, released &quot;Odnoetazhnaya Amerika&quot; (&quot;One-Storied America&quot;), a 16-episode travel documentary based on the 1937 book &quot;Little Golden America&quot; by Ilya Ilf and Yevgenyi Petrov. Pozner and Urgant also collaborated on a number of subsequent projects: &quot;Tour de France&quot;, &quot;Their Italy&quot;, &quot;German Conundrum&quot;, &quot;England Generally and Particularly&quot;, and &quot;Jewish Happiness&quot;, broadcast in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 respectively.

In 2008 Pozner launched the eponymous show &quot;Pozner&quot; on Russia&#x27;s Channel One, in which he interviews public figures – politicians, artists, scientists, musicians, actors, directors, sportsmen, doctors, magnates, and so on – at the rate of one interview per episode. Pozner has a lively and unconstrained style of hosting and he often fires cutting off-the-cuff remarks at his guests. He frequently comments, too, on how the political or economic decision at issue in any of his shows could affect the common people of Russia.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the show stopped airing. The last broadcast was on 21 February 2022, and Pozner declined to explain why the show stopped appearing on television. However, in March 2022, he revealed in his website that Channel One had suspended the program to make room for covering the &quot;special military operation&quot;.

==Personal life==
In his final year at Moscow University (1958) Pozner married Valentina Chemberdzhi, a fellow student in the Department of Philology. Two years later they had a daughter, Yekaterina. Since 1990 Yekaterina has lived in Berlin, where she is a professional pianist and composer, working as Katia Tchemberdji. Pozner and his first wife divorced in 1968.

Around the time of his divorce, Pozner met Yekaterina Orlova, who would become his second wife, while they were both working for the Novosti Press Agency&#x27;s &quot;Sputnik&quot; magazine. They remained married for 35 years. Orlova, an experienced journalist in her own right, was a co-founder of the Pozner School for Television Excellence. Since 2005 Pozner has been linked with Nadezhda Solovyova, а leading Russian show business impresario.

Pozner holds three citizenships: French - by birth, Russian (initially, Soviet) - presumably by descent and US - obtained in the early 1990s by naturalization. In 1968, while attempting to renounce his French nationality so that he could visit France without fear of prosecution for failure to serve in the Algerian War, he was formally notified by the Soviet Foreign Ministry that his Soviet passport, initially granted to him in 1950, at 16, had been issued in error, and that he was not in fact a citizen of the USSR. Much to Pozner&#x27;s amusement this also technically invalidated, among other things, his membership in the CPSU, his marriage and divorce, his residency permit (&quot;propiska&quot;), and his rank of lieutenant in the reserves.

Pozner is a fan of tennis and baseball. In 1992, he co-founded The Moscow Dummies (Московские Чайники, lit. the Moscow Teapots, see &quot;chainik&quot; for the term), an amateur baseball team. He is a cigar aficionado. He also collects turtle figurines and fountain pens. He enjoys playing charades.

==Views==
Pozner is an atheist.

He advocates the right to euthanasia, advocates the legalization of same-sex marriage, and supports the idea of combating drug trafficking and crime among drug addicts by legalizing the sale of drugs.

He credits the expansion of NATO since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the post-cold war strategy, and the subsequent lack of attention to specific Russian diplomatic overtures for the creation of Vladimir Putin.

==Controversies==
In April 2021, Pozner was forced to cut his birthday celebration short and flee Georgia after his hotel was blockaded by protesters calling him a &quot;Kremlin propagandist&quot;. Protesters pelted Pozner&#x27;s entourage with eggs and were angry with his past statements, where in 2010, Pozner blamed Georgia for the situation that led to the Russo-Georgian War and said: &quot;Georgia lost [Abkhazia] forever&quot; and that it &quot;will never be Georgia&#x27;s territory again.&quot; The visit was permitted by the Georgian government, and Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili defended his government&#x27;s decision to permit the visit, saying that Pozner had a negative test for COVID-19 on entry which was valid and that he did not appear to break any local laws aimed at opposing the Russian military occupation of the breakaway regions. Garibashvili blamed the National Movement and its supporters for the incident, calling the protests &quot;actions that violated civilized norms and Georgian standards&quot;.

<doc id="951668" wikidata="Q2744274" url="?curid=951668" title="Bobby Capó">
<text>Félix Manuel &quot;Bobby&quot; Rodríguez Capó (January 1, 1922 – December 18, 1989) was a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter. He usually combined ballads with classical music and was deeply involved in Puerto Rican folk elements and even Andalusian music, as to produce many memorable Latino pop songs which featured elaborate, dramatic lyrics.

==Early life==
Félix Manuel Rodríguez Capó was born in the barrio of Pedro García in Coamo, Puerto Rico to Celso Quiterio Rodríguez Rivera, a salesman, and Arsenia Capó Canevaro, a housekeeper. He adopted &quot;Bobby&quot; as his first name and, as Rodríguez is a common Hispanic surname, he reportedly opted to use his mother&#x27;s less common one, Capó, instead.

==Career==
Capó moved to New York City early in the 1940s. Initially, he replaced Pedro Ortiz Dávila, &quot;Davilita&quot;, in a quartet, the Cuarteto Victoria of Rafael Hernández Marín. He then joined Xavier Cugat&#x27;s orchestra.

Apart from his work as a singer, he was also a television host, as well as technical and musical director, and prolific songwriter. He wrote songs for many of his contemporaries. Many of these became hits in Puerto Rico, and occasionally in the rest of Latin America. One of his self-penned songs was &quot;El Negro Bembón&quot;, a hit for Cortijo y su Combo in the mid-1950s. The song, with local circumstances and character name changed, became &quot;El Gitano Antón&quot;, a huge hit for Catalan rumba singer Peret in Spain around the mid-1960s. Bobby Capó wrote the score and songs for the movie &quot;MARUJA&quot; that was filmed at the end of the 1950s in Puerto Rico.

Capó&#x27;s &quot;Sin Fe&quot; (&quot;Without Faith&quot;), sometimes known as &quot;Poquita Fe&quot; (&quot;Little Faith&quot;), became a proper hit in Puerto Rico when recorded by Felipe Rodríguez in the mid-1950s, and a huge international hit for José Feliciano in the mid-1960s. Capó&#x27;s composition describing his homesickness for Puerto Rico, &quot;Soñando con Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Dreaming of Puerto Rico&quot;), is revered as an anthem by Puerto Ricans residing abroad. Another of his songs, &quot;De Las Montañas Venimos&quot;, is a Christmas standard in Puerto Rico.

His best-known song is &quot;Piel Canela&quot; (whose title literally translates to &quot;Cinnamon Skin&quot;). He wrote and recorded an English-language version, &quot;You, Too&quot;, which he most notably recorded in Havana at the request of Rogelio Martínez of Sonora Matancera, who asked him to sing pieces of his recently composed songs with his band. Josephine Baker recorded a version in French. The song became the main theme for a Mexican movie of the same name in the late 1950s. So was &quot;Luna de Miel en Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rican Honeymoon&quot;), a latter-day chachachá which was the theme for an eponymous movie, co-produced by Mexicans and Puerto Ricans in the early 1960s.

In the early 1970s, Bobby Capó worked for the Puerto Rican government as the Ambassador of the Puerto Rican Consulate Embassy located on Park Avenue and 23rd Street in New York City. In later years, Bobby Capó later worked for the Department of Labor&#x27;s Division of Migration.

==Personal life==
In 1944, he married Mercedes Ramos, and after their divorce, in 1948 Capó married Irma Nydia Vázquez, his second wife and the first Miss Puerto Rico to participate in the Miss America pageant and the daughter of a wealthy Puerto Rican industrialist. The marriage was frowned upon by her family, and he wrote: &quot;El Bardo&quot; (&quot;The Bard&quot;) inspired by this issue. &quot;El Bardo&quot; tells of a pauper who died heartbroken after his wealthy love prospect marries another man, and finishes up with her (also heartbroken) reaction to his death. The song was a huge hit for Felipe Rodríguez in the early 1950s and has been covered by many others. 
Capo had six children: Félix Manuel Rodríguez (musician Bobby Capo Jr, father of Pedro Capó), Irma &quot;Mimi&quot; Rodríguez López, Soraya Rodríguez, Waldo Rodríguez, Jacqueline Rodríguez (also a singer) and Zahera Rodríguez.

==Death==

<doc id="951671" wikidata="Q1753071" url="?curid=951671" title="Maracatu">
<text>The term maracatu denotes any of several performance genres found in Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil. Main types of maracatu include &quot;maracatu nação&quot; (nation-style maracatu) and &quot;maracatu rural&quot; (rural-style maracatu).

==Maracatu Nação==

Maracatu nação (also known as &quot;maracatu de baque virado&quot;: &quot;maracatu of the turned-around beat&quot;), the most well-known of the maracatu genres, is an Afro-Brazilian performance genre practiced in the state of Pernambuco, mainly in the cities of Recife and Olinda. The term, often shortened simply to &quot;nação&quot; (&quot;nation&quot;, pl. &quot;nações&quot;), refers not only to the performance but to the performing groups themselves.

&quot;Maracatu nação&quot;’s origins lie in the investiture ceremonies of the &quot;Reis do Congo&quot; (Kings of Congo), who were enslaved people who were granted leadership roles within the enslaved community by the Portuguese administration. When slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888, the institution of the Kings of Congo ceased to exist. Nonetheless, &quot;nações&quot; continued to choose symbolic leaders and evoke coronation ceremonies for those leaders. Although a &quot;maracatu&quot; performance is secular, traditional &quot;nações&quot; are grouped around Candomblé or Jurema (Afro-Brazilian religions) &quot;terreiros&quot; (bases), and the principles of Candomblé infuse their activities.

Traditional &quot;nações&quot; perform by parading with a drumming group of 80–100, a singer and chorus, and a coterie of dancers and stock characters including a king and a queen. Dancers and stock characters dress and behave to imitate the Portuguese royal court of the Baroque period.

The performance also enacts pre-colonial African traditions, like parading the &quot;calunga&quot;, a doll representing tribal deities that is kept throughout the year in a special place in the nação&#x27;s headquarters. The &quot;calungas&quot;, usually female, are traditionally made of either wax and wood or of cloth. They may have clothing made for them in a similar Baroque style to the costumes worn by the other members of the royal court. The &quot;calunga&quot; is sacred, and carrying this spiritual figurehead of the group is a great responsibility for the female &quot;Dama de Paço&quot; (Lady-in-Waiting) of the cortège.

The musical ensemble consists of &quot;alfaia&quot; (a large wooden rope-tuned drum), &quot;gonguê&quot; (a metal cowbell), &quot;tarol&quot; (a shallow snare drum), &quot;caixa-de-guerra&quot; (or &quot;war-snare&quot;), &quot;abê&quot; (a gourd shaker enveloped in a net of beads), and &quot;mineiro&quot; (a metal cylindrical shaker filled with metal shot or small dried seeds). The song form is call and response between a solo singer and (usually) a female chorus.

Today there are around 20 &quot;nações&quot; operating in the cities of Recife and Olinda. Although several have an unbroken line of activity going back to the 19th century, most have been set up in recent decades. Well-known &quot;nações&quot; include Estrela Brilhante, Leão Coroado, and Porto Rico. Each year they perform during the Carnival period in Recife and Olinda. Maracatu Nação Pernambuco, while not a traditional &quot;maracatu&quot;, was primarily responsible for introducing the genre to overseas audiences in the 1990s.

The genre has inspired the establishment of performing groups in a number of cities outside Brazil, including Lisbon, Toronto, Quebec City, New York City, Austin, Washington, D.C., Cologne, Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, Lyon, Stockholm, London, Edinburgh, Brighton, Madison, Oakland, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, Manchester, Bristol, Oxford, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Madrid.

==Maracatu Rural==

Maracatu Rural, rooted in the Pernambucan interior, is also known as &quot;maracatu de baque solto&quot;, &quot;maracatu de orquesta&quot;, and &quot;maracatu de trombone&quot;. Although it shares its name with the &quot;maracatu nação&quot; found in that state&#x27;s cities, it is substantially different in terms of narrative, practice, and instrumentation. It evolved in the early 20th century as a fusion of pre-existing forms of Carnival revelry. It is considered to be Afro-indigenous in origin. Its members, typically sugarcane workers, are involved in the native-influenced &quot;Catimbó&quot; religion. &quot;Maracatu rural&quot; has a high participation rate with dozens of groups in operation.

==Maracatu cearense==

Maracatu cearense is Fortaleza&#x27;s variant of &quot;maracatu nação&quot;. Brought to Fortaleza, Ceará, in 1936, &quot;maracatu cearense&quot; has since been cultivated as the city&#x27;s most distinctive Carnival performance tradition, owing in part to its use of blackface makeup to enact Afro-Brazilian characters and male-to-female transvestitism of the important female personages, particularly the queen. Its rhythms are described locally as &quot;cadenciado&quot;, &quot;cadenced,&quot; which amounts to a less syncopated, steadier 2/4 meter and a slower tempo than is found in the &quot;maracatu nação&quot; of Pernambuco, sometimes as slow as 45 beats per minute. In recent decades groups have tended to divide into those that retain the slow tempo (to express the misery of slavery) and those that speed up their tempos (to express the exuberance of Carnival), and there is some dispute over which style most authentically expresses the tradition in Ceará. Standard instrumentation is also distinctive. Instead of &quot;alfaia&quot; drums, the &quot;cearense&quot; tradition uses &quot;surdo&quot; or &quot;bombo&quot; drums; like Pernambuco, it uses the &quot;&quot;, or snare drum. Instead of the &quot;gonguê&quot;, large single-head bell, &quot;maracatu cearense&quot; uses the &quot;ferro&quot;, a heavy iron-slab triangle, to keep its steady duple rhythm. Individual groups often add to or slightly modify this setup to create their own distinct sound.

Every year, different &quot;maracatu cearense&quot; nations parade in Fortaleza&#x27;s traditional municipal Carnival competition, normally taking place at Domingos Olímpio Avenue. The oldest nation, &quot;Az de Ouro&quot; (Golden Ace), founded in 1936, is still in operation. Other nations include &quot;Vozes d&#x27;África&quot; (Voices of Africa), &quot;Nação Fortaleza&quot;, &quot;Rei de Paus&quot;, &quot;Nação Iracema&quot;, and &quot;Maracatu Solar&quot;.

The use of blackface in &quot;maracatu cearense&quot; reportedly stems from Fortaleza&#x27;s mostly white and &quot;caboclo&quot; demographic, and its small black population (4.4%) (IGBE 2008), which effects a situation where mostly white and brown people end up performing a traditionally black expression of Brazilian Carnival. Blackface in this context is intended to pay homage to the African slaves&#x27; contribution to Brazilian civilization and is not viewed as a racist expression (compared, for instance, to the blackface minstrelsy of the United States, which parodied black speech and character). In fact, some &quot;maracatu cearense&quot; nations are actively involved in racial equality and black consciousness initiatives in Ceará. Among these is Nação Iracema, founded in 2002 by Lúcia Simão and William Augusto Pereira, heads of the first black family in Fortaleza to direct a maracatu nation (current ). Lúcia Simão also founded Ceará&#x27;s first black consciousness movement in the early 1980s. This consciousness of racial equality operates through &quot;maracatu cearense&quot; performance in part as the continuation of Ceará&#x27;s historical identity as the first region in Brazil to abolish slavery, in May 1884 (the rest of the nation followed suit in 1888).

Contrary to the claims of most &quot;maracatu cearense&quot; participants, at least one Brazilian scholar sees the development of the tradition in Fortaleza to be intimately tied to a subtle racist discourse in Ceará that has mythologized itself as a non-black region of Brazil (thus, the justification for blackface), perpetuating Brazil&#x27;s longstanding racist ideology of skin whitening.

<text>Bruce Anthony Reid (born 14 March 1963) is a former Australian international cricketer. A tall left-arm fast-medium bowler, Reid also played domestically for his home state Western Australia. He was a part of the Australian team that won their first world title during the 1987 Cricket World Cup, and is the first Australian to take a hat-trick in the ODI format of the game.

==Playing career==
Reid played for Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield from 1984–85 to 1995–96.

===International career===

Reid represented Australia in Test cricket between December 1985 and December 1992 and in One Day Internationals between January 1986 and March 1992. He played 27 Test matches for Australia taking 113 Test wickets at an average of 24.63 runs per wicket. He also played 61 ODIs, taking 63 wickets.

Reid bowled left-arm fast-medium and had natural swing and an awkward angle of delivery. He achieved steepling bounce from his great height and was very accurate. Reid made his debut against India in January 1986. He was a mainstay of the Australian bowling attack from that time on. However, during Australia&#x27;s tour of Pakistan in 1988 he suffered a back injury. Thereafter, Reid was frequently injured and was rarely fully fit, which limited his international career. In the 1990–91 Ashes series against England he took 27 wickets at an average of 16.00 in the first four Tests and won the award for player of the series, despite missing the last Test due to injury.

==Post-playing career==
Since retirement as a player, Reid has developed a career as a bowling coach, and worked with teams around the world including the India cricket team (during the 2003–04 tour of Australia), the Zimbabwe national team and Hampshire County Cricket Club. He has also mentored Australian fast bowlers, including Nathan Bracken.

==Personal life==
Reid was born in Osborne Park, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. He was a cousin of New Zealand batsman John Reid. At tall, Reid is same height as former West Indian fast bowler Joel Garner. Until the appearance of tall Pakistani left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Irfan in 2010, Reid and Garner were the tallest players ever to have played international cricket.

<text>Galkayo (, , Italian: &quot;Gallacaio also known as Rocca Littorio&quot;) is the third-largest city in Somalia which serves as the capital of the north-central Mudug region. 

Geographically, Galkayo is divided into four main quarters: Garsoor, Horumar, Israac, and Wadajir. Puntland controls the majority of Galkayo with Horumar, Israac and Garsoor under the state’s administration. Galkayo serves as the capital of the Galkayo District. The city has grown considerably in recent times and serves as a commercial hub connecting southern Somalia with the northern parts of the country.

==History==
At its founding, the city was primarily inhabited by pastoralists, who sporadically fought in clan groups over resources like water and grazing land. In particular, the Darod, dominant in the north of the city, and the Hawiye, dominant in the south of the city, fought over the city due to their long-standing rivalry.

Galkayo was formally established in the late 19th century by Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Hobyo Sultanate. Kenadid, as part of an ongoing power struggle with his rivals in the Majeerteen Sultanate, signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Italy to become a protectorate, thereby passing the city into nominal Italian control. Under Italian rule, the city&#x27;s communities were split along the &quot;Tomaselli Line&quot; to prevent further conflict between the Darod and the Hawiye.

After World War II, Italian Somaliland became the Trust Territory of Somalia under the guidance of the United Nations. At this time, the city saw significant unity among rival groups due to growing Somali nationalism, spurred by the growing influence of the Somali Youth League, a Somali nationalist political party. Following the independence of Somalia in 1960, Galkayo was made the center of Galkayo District and the capital of Mudug region.

The city fell back into conflict during the rule of Siad Barre, who actively took advantage of class differences within the city to exercise his power. In particular, Barre, a member of a Darod subclan, backed the Darod people in their struggle over the city. On 12 November 1989, a group of Hawiye officers mutinied against Barre&#x27;s regime for this clan favoritism. This mutiny was put down a day later by a militia led by Maslah Mohammed Barre, Siad Barre&#x27;s son. Hawiye villages around Galkayo were punished in response to the mutiny by Barre&#x27;s militia, furthering the divide between them and the Darod, and leading to a subsequent mutiny in Mogadishu on 5 December 1989.

During the Somali Civil War, the Hawiye rebel organization United Somali Congress attacked Darod elements in Galkayo, starting a major clan war surrounding the city and Mudug region as a whole. The fighting clans drew administrative borders through the city, splitting it between the Darod-controlled Puntland and the Hawiye-controlled Galmudug, strengthening the divide between them. As the fighting of the Somali Civil War became more violent, the United Nations intervened with United Nations Operation in Somalia II, and negotiated peace within the Mudug region and the withdrawal of militant fighters from Galkayo.

In June 1993, in order to end the fighting in Galkayo, it was decided to relocate the militias that were in conflict in the city to Wargalo, Buryaqab (Harfo) and Galdogob, which are 70 kilometers away.

Conflicts between Puntland and Galmudug authorities continued to erupt over the status of Galkayo. In November 2015, anger over the construction of a road in Puntland caused a skirmish which left 20 dead, 120 injured, and 90,000 displaced. Another conflict arose in October 2016 over construction rights in a disputed area of the city, which saw a ceasefire agreement meant to allow free transport of goods and people between the two administrations and establish a joint police force to protect the entire city.

==Geography==
===Location===
Galkayo is situated in north-central Somalia, in the heart of the Mudug region. Nearby settlements include to the east Godad (7.1 nm), to the northeast Bali busle (16.2 nm), to the north Halobooqad (4.4 nm), to the northwest Beyra (12.8 nm), to the west Xera Jaale-bayra (23.8 nm), to the southwest Saaxo (30 nm), to the south Laascadale (10.2 nm), and to the southeast Arfuda (13.0 nm). The largest cities in the country most proximate to Galkayo are Hobyo (217 km), Garowe (219 km) and Qardho (358 km). Shimbiris, the highest peak in Somalia, is located some 432 km to the north in the Cal Madow mountain range.

===Climate===
Galkayo has a hot arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;).

==Administration==

Galkayo is situated in the north-central part of Somalia, and is one of the most developed towns in the region. The city is divided into four main districts called Garsoor, Horumar, Israac, and Wadajir respectively. The Puntland Administration fully controls Garsoor, Israac, and Horumar (The neutral areas are sited by the Old Galkayo market and the loose boundary.

Although relatively stable compared to southern Somalia, sporadic targeted assassination attempts by Al-Shabaab militants against Puntland public officials led to a police crackdown and comprehensive administrative reform in 2010 and 2011. The Puntland and Galmudug administrations subsequently signed an accord in Garowe in February 2011, officially agreeing to cooperate on security, economic and social matters so as to strengthen inter-regional relations.

==Services==

A lively trading city, Galkayo is a center for local business. Hotels, guest houses, restaurants, supermarkets and newly erected office blocks earmarked for the government and NGOs line the streets, juxtaposed by the tall minarets of masjids. The city also offers numerous social services such as hospitals, petrol stops and police stations, with the former Somali Army barracks kept in good condition and renovated.

Moreover, Galkayo is a hub of calligraphic art, serving as a training ground of sorts for local visual artists. Elaborate murals and phrases in Arabic and English adorn the walls of the city&#x27;s many office and shop buildings.

==Demographics==
In 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organization noted that population estimates for Galkayo ranged from 75,000 to 315,000, with a United Nations Development Programme estimate for 2005 being 105,000. The International Crisis Group gives a figure of 137,000 for 2015.

The Puntland area of the city is composed predominately of the Omar Mahamud and Reer Mahamud sub-clans of the Majerteen, followed by the Mumin Aden and Fiqi Ismael sub-clans of the Leelkase, as well as Arab Salah and Surre clans.

The neighborhood of Wadajir in the southern area of the city, is mainly inhabited by the Sa&#x27;ad sub-division of the Habar Gidir.

==Education==

Galkayo has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 40 primary schools in the Galkayo District. Among these are the Axmed Guray school in Israac, named after Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (Ahmed Gurey); Al-Qudus in Horumar; and Barkhadle in Garsoor, built in honour of the 13th century scholar and saint Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn (Aw Barkhadle). Puntland secondary schools in the area include Haji Ali Bihi, Cumar Samatar Secondary School (CSSS), Yasin Nor Hassan and Galkayo High. In addition, several new schools were opened in 2012.

Institutions of higher learning with a presence in the city include the Puntland State University, Puntland University of Science and Technology, Galkayo University, and Mudug University. East Africa University (EAU) also has a Galkayo branch, one of its seven campuses in Puntland. Additionally, the public Galkayo Vocational Training Centre and the privately owned Mudug Vocational Training Center provide technical training.

==Sports==
Galkayo is home to Awale Stadium, a sporting facility that is named in memory of Mohammed Awale Liban, a Somali nationalist who designed the flag of Somalia in 1954. The stadium hosts many local football clubs, including FC YAMAYS, RPS FC, Dowladda Hoose FC, Comced FC, Homboboro FC, Telecom FC and Galcom FC.
In addition, the city also has another stadium Abdullahi Issa stadium in the South, named after Abdullahi Issa, the Prime Minister of Italian Somalia during the trusteeship period, serving from February 29, 1956, to July 1, 1960. Various courts built specifically for basketball and volleyball also exist in the city.

==Transportation==
Air transportation in Galacyo is served by the Abdullahi Yusuf Airport, operated by Puntland and Oshaco International Airport operated by Galmudug. Unlike Abdullahi Yusuf Airport, Oshaco International Airport does not have IATA and ICAO airport codes as it is not recognized by any international entity.
In September 2013, the Somali federal government signed an official cooperation agreement with its Chinese counterpart in Mogadishu as part of a five-year national recovery plan. The pact will see the Chinese authorities reconstruct several major infrastructural landmarks in the Somali capital and elsewhere, as well as the road linking Galkayo with Burao.

==Media==
Various media organizations are based in Galkayo. These include Radio Daljir, Radio Galmudug and Radio Codka-Mudug. Radio Gaalkacyo, formerly known as Radio Free Somalia, also broadcasts from the city.

<doc id="951680" wikidata="Q2276754" url="?curid=951680" title="Kermit Love">
<text>Kermit Ernest Hollingshead Love (August 7, 1916 – June 21, 2008) was an American puppet maker, puppeteer, costume designer, and actor in children&#x27;s television and on Broadway. He was best known as a designer and builder with the Muppets, in particular those on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

==Early life==
Love was born in Spring Lake, New Jersey on August 7, 1916, to Ernest and Alice Love. He was raised by his grandmother and great-grandmother following his mother&#x27;s death when he was three years old.

==Career==
===Theater===
Love began his theatrical career working as a marionette maker for a federal Works Progress Administration theater in Newark, New Jersey in 1935. He was also a costume designer for Broadway and other stage productions as in the 1930s, including the Mercury Theatre troupe with Orson Welles. Love also appeared on stage in a bit part as a student for the 1937 play &quot;Naught Naught 00&quot;.

Love worked with many of the great figures of mid-century Broadway and American ballet. He was the costumer for the Agnes de Mille ballet &quot;Rodeo&quot; (1942), for the Kurt Weill musical &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (1943), and for Merce Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;The Wind Remains&quot; (1943) and Jerome Robbins&#x27;s ballet &quot;Fancy Free&quot; (1944). For George Balanchine he designed, amongst other items, a marionette giant for &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1965).

===Jim Henson and the Muppets===
During the early 1960s, Love first crossed paths with Jim Henson through Don Sahlin, who urged him to meet with Henson. The three first collaborated on the La Choy Dragon for advertising the chow mein brand, which was a precursor to Big Bird. Love&#x27;s theatrical background had given him particular skill at handling full body-puppets and tailoring them to allow freedom for the performer&#x27;s movements. From this, Love went on to build Oscar the Grouch and then Big Bird after a drawing was designed by Henson (though Sahlin had carved the first head). Love talked about how he designed Big Bird to subtly shed feathers in the course of normal movement, &quot;Not unlike a tree shedding leaves in the Fall.&quot; He believed this made Big Bird appear more natural to young viewers. Love co-designed Cookie Monster and he designed Mr. Snuffleupagus. He accompanied the Big Bird costume (Love preferred calling it a &quot;puppet&quot;) when it traveled overseas for appearances.

Despite popular rumor, Love was not the namesake of Kermit the Frog; the character was created and named in 1955, before Henson met Love in the 1960s.

Though he also worked on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was Love&#x27;s domain, along with Caroly Wilcox, as one of the key supervisors. He portrayed Willy, the hot dog vendor, on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He puppeteered on the special &quot;Julie on Sesame Street&quot;. For the feature film &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot;, he served as special Muppet consultant, and appeared in many background scenes as Willy. He co-designed many of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; puppets for the early international productions. For the special &quot;The Great Santa Claus Switch&quot;, he contributed to the giant Thig.

In his memoir &quot;The Wit and Wisdom of Big Bird&quot;, Caroll Spinney speaks affectionately of Love and his importance to the show, though noting an occasional cantankerous side.

===Beyond &quot;Sesame Street&quot;===
In addition to his work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Love remained busy as freelancer, creating and building puppets for the non-Henson puppet series &quot;The Great Space Coaster&quot;.

One of his specials was watched by a young Kevin Clash, whose parents contacted Love and told him about their son. Love worked as a mentor to Clash and introduced him to Jim Henson, and helped Clash get jobs on children&#x27;s shows &quot;The Great Space Coaster&quot; and &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. After both shows were canceled, Clash moved on to &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Other works included building the Snuggle Bear puppet for the Snuggle fabric softener advertisements.

Love appeared as Santa Claus on the cover of &quot;New York&quot; magazine in December 1982, 1984, and 1985.

Going into semi-retirement in the 1990s, Love remained active, building many full-body puppets for the Joffrey Ballet&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; performances, such as designing the mice and the -tall Mother Ginger puppet, an association that continued to 2004. In 1993, he directed the &quot;Whirligig&quot; pilot for PBS at The Studios at Las Colinas, Irving, Texas. In 2001, he designed Aza, the bird-like mascot for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

==Personal life and death==
Although he was American, Love often spoke with an English, and sometimes French, accent. He resided in Stanfordville, New York.

Love died on June 21, 2008, of congestive heart failure and pneumonia in Poughkeepsie, New York. He was survived by Christopher Lyall, his partner of 50 years.

<doc id="951688" wikidata="Q7356892" url="?curid=951688" title="Rodney Croome">
<text>Rodney Peter Croome AM is an Australian LGBT rights activist and academic. He worked on the campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in Tasmania, was a founder of Australian Marriage Equality, and currently serves as the spokesperson for the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group and a spokesperson for LGBT advocacy group Just.Equal.

==Early life==
Croome grew up on a dairy farm in Tasmania&#x27;s North West and studied European History at the University of Tasmania, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1988.

==Activism==
===Tasmania===
Croome was the founding president and long-term board member of the Tasmanian LGBT support organisation, &#x27;Working It Out&#x27; as well as serving on various other similar organisations and had been in a leading role in the establishing challenging-homophobia education in Tasmanian state schools and in the Tasmanian Police, as well as the instituting of anti-discrimination laws in Tasmania. He also fronted the successful campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in Tasmania, which until 1 May 1997 was a criminal offence punishable by up to 25 years in jail. That campaign saw Tasmanian activists take their case to the United Nations (&quot;Toonen v Australia&quot;), the Federal Government and the High Court. In 1997 in the case of &quot;Croome v Tasmania&quot;, Croome applied to the High Court of Australia for a ruling as to whether the Tasmanian laws were inconsistent with the federal &quot;Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994&quot;. The Tasmanian Government repealed the relevant Criminal Code provisions after failing in its attempts to have the matter struck out. In 2009, Croome was named one of the 25 most influential gay Australians by readers of the website samesame.com.au.

Croome called for reviews of blood donors processes, saying the screening process of blood donors did not question heterosexuals on their safe sex practices, but singled out gay and bisexual men as high risk: &quot;It&#x27;s really time for the Red Cross to change its policy and focus on whether donors have safe or unsafe sex rather than the gender of the person they have sex with.&quot;

===Same-sex marriage===
Croome was one of the first advocates in Australia to raise the issue of same-sex marriage circa 2004, at a time when it wasn&#x27;t a popular topic of discussion both within the LGBTI community and more broadly. Despite opposition to the idea of marriage equality, Croome would commit the next 13 years of his life fighting for marriage equality for all Australians.

In 2010, Croome co-authored a book presenting the cases for and against marriage equality, entitled &quot;WHY vs WHY: Gay Marriage&quot; (Pantera Press).

In 2012, Croome became the fifth National Director of Australian Marriage Equality. On 8 May 2013 Croome debated Patrick Langrell on Same Sex Marriage at the University of New South Wales. In September 2013 Rodney Croome wrote to the group Community Action Against Homophobia CAAH expressing his concerns in regards to the radical campaigning methods they use in same-sex marriage campaigns saying, &quot;It is a double standard to demand respect for same-sex relationships without showing the same respect in return&quot;. Croome supports Australia&#x27;s trans and intersex communities in their quest for marriage equality saying, &quot;the marriage equality campaign must be inclusive of all loving committed couples regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status&quot;.

In 2015, Croome released his latest book, &quot;From This Day Forward: Marriage Equality in Australia&quot; (Walleah Press).

In 2015, Tasmanian Archbishop Julius Porteous distributed a political booklet titled, &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with Marriage&quot; that advised parents to lobby MPs against same-sex marriage. Croome encouraged parents to submit complaints to the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, stating “I urge everyone who finds it offensive and inappropriate, including teachers, parents and students, to complain to the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, Robin Banks”. The ABC &quot;Media Watch&quot; program reported that Croome, along with Christine Forster, had been interviewed 32 times on the subject of same-sex marriage, in the first 12 days of August 2015.

==Career==
Croome has been the editor of the Tasmanian literary journal, &#x27;Island&#x27;, a research consultant for the Port Arthur Management Authority and the Australian National University-based Freilich Foundation, and an Honorary lecturer Sociology at the University of Tasmania.

==Awards==
Croome was made the inaugural recipient of the Tasmanian Humanitarian of the Year Award and awarded the Chris Carter Memorial Award for contributions to the gay and lesbian community by the Australian Democrats in 1991. In 1994, he was shortlisted for Australian of the Year. In January 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;service and extensive contribution to gay and lesbian law reform&quot; and in June 2003 he was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for &quot;service to the community as a human rights advocate, particularly through promoting tolerance and understanding of the human rights of gay and lesbian people&quot;. Croome was named Tasmanian Australian of the Year for 2015, and consequently was a finalist for 2015 Australian of the Year.

<text>Thomas Munkelt (born 3 August 1952) is a retired East German athlete, winner of 110 m hurdles at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

Born in Zedtlitz, Bezirk Leipzig, East Germany, Thomas Munkelt was a classic high hurdler who dominated European hurdling in the 1970s and early 1980s. Munkelt was the first athlete to break the 7.50 seconds barrier in the 60m hurdles, when he ran a 7.48 seconds World Record in Budapest in 1983.

Munkelt came into the international athletics scene in 1975 when he won his first of nine East German national championship title and European Cup in 110 m hurdles. Although he finished disappointing fifth at the 1976 Summer Olympics, he won both World Cup and European Cup in 1977. The first international championships medal came, when Munkelt finished first at the 1978 European Championships.

Munkelt&#x27;s career highlight came at the Moscow Olympics, where he beat second placed Alejandro Casañas from Cuba by 0.01 seconds. He also was a member of fifth placed 4 × 100 m relay team. He defended his title successfully at the 1982 European Championships and won silver as a member of a 4x100 relay team. He won again the European Cup in the next year, but finished only fifth at the first World Championships.

After hearing the East German government&#x27;s decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics, Munkelt decided to retire from athletics.

His personal best was 13.37 seconds, achieved in August 1977 in Helsinki. This ranks him seventh among German 110 m hurdlers, behind Florian Schwarthoff, Mike Fenner, Eric Kaiser, Falk Balzer, Thomas Blaschek and Sven Göhler.

<doc id="951693" wikidata="Q4587500" url="?curid=951693" title="Buckskin (horse)">
<text>Buckskin is a colour of horse (sometimes misunderstood as a breed). Buckskins coloring is a hair coat color referring to a color that resembles certain shades of tanned deerskin. Similar colors in some breeds of dogs are also called buckskin. The horse has a tan or gold colored coat with black points (mane, tail, and lower legs). Buckskin occurs as a result of the cream dilution gene acting on a bay horse. Therefore, a buckskin has the Extension, or &quot;black base coat&quot; (E) gene, the agouti gene (A) gene (see bay for more on the agouti gene), which restricts the black base coat to the points, and one copy of the cream gene (CCr), which lightens the red/brown color of the bay coat to a tan/gold.

Buckskins should not be confused with dun-colored horses, which have the dun dilution gene, not the cream gene. Duns always have primitive markings (shoulder blade stripes, dorsal stripe, zebra stripes on legs, webbing). However, it is possible for a horse to carry both dilution genes; these are called &quot;buckskin duns&quot; or sometimes &quot;dunskins.&quot; Also, bay horses without any dun gene may have a faint dorsal stripe, which sometimes is darkened in a buckskin without a dun gene being present. Additional primitive striping beyond just a dorsal stripe is a sure sign of the dun gene.

A buckskin horse can occur in any number of different breeds. At least one parent must carry the cream gene, and not all breeds do. Since 1963, the American Buckskin Registry Association (ABRA) has been keeping track of horses with this coat color, and although Buckskin is sometimes classified as a color breed, due to its genetic makeup that depends on having one, not two copies of the dilution allele, coat color cannot ever be a consistent true-breeding trait.

<text>Bernard Wrigley (born 25 February 1948 in Bolton, Lancashire, England) is an English singer, actor and comedian. He is sometimes known by the nickname &quot;The Bolton Bullfrog&quot;.

Wrigley&#x27;s career as a singer and storyteller began in the late 1960s, when a love of folk music led him to perform in folk clubs. Since then he has released over sixteen albums of traditional and original songs, stories and monologues. His main instruments are the guitar and concertina.

He began acting around the same time and has made many appearances on stage, most famously in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; alongside Mike Harding at Bolton&#x27;s Octagon Theatre, and Jim Cartwright&#x27;s &quot;Road&quot; at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester.

Wrigley has made many appearances in British TV programmes in a career spanning over five decades, including &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; (where he was Dodgy Eric, who sold club owner Brian Potter a &quot;Das Boot&quot; fruit machine, a bucking bronco and an obscene bouncy castle), &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (as eccentric rocket inventor Barry Clegg) and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (most recently as the Rev. Marvin Winstanley, the shady &#x27;internet priest&#x27; whom Roy and Hayley approached to arrange their wedding - Wrigley&#x27;s sixth character in the soap). His other credits include &quot;Wood and Walters&quot;, &quot;Home and Away&quot;, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, &quot;Cold Feet&quot;, &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;dinnerladies&quot;, &quot;Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings&quot;, &quot;Shameless&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; &quot;In with the Flynns&quot; and Fat Friends. He also appeared as a union official in &quot;Brassed Off&quot; and as a school teacher in &quot;Rita, Sue and Bob Too&quot;. In 1978 he was a night school teacher in Alan Bennett&#x27;s play, &quot;Me! I&#x27;m Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot;.

On BBC Radio 4 he has acted in plays lasting from 15 to 90 minutes. BBC Radio Lancashire has broadcast many of his pre-recorded series, such as &quot;Wrigley&#x27;s Ramblings&quot; and &quot;Home Brewed&quot;, and his readings of many stories written by Tommy Thompson.

As a writer he has released various combinations of his songs and monologues. In 2006, he produced a book of silly one-verse poems &quot;Shorts For All Occasions&quot;, which was followed in 2008 by &quot;The Longs &amp; The Shorts Of It&quot;.

<text>Eleuthera () refers both to a single island in the archipelagic state of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and to its associated group of smaller islands. Eleuthera forms a part of the Great Bahama Bank. The island of Eleuthera incorporates the smaller Harbour Island. &quot;Eleuthera&quot; derives from the feminine form of the Greek adjective (&quot;eleútheros&quot;), meaning &quot;free&quot;. Known in the 17th century as Cigateo, it lies 80 km (50 miles) east of Nassau. It is long and thin—180 km (110 miles) long and in places little more than 1.6 km (1.0 mile) wide. At its narrowest point, the Glass Window Bridge, which has been called the narrowest place on earth, Eleuthera stands 30 feet wide. Its eastern side faces the Atlantic Ocean and its western side faces the Great Bahama Bank. The topography of the island varies from wide rolling pink sand beaches to large outcrops of ancient coral reefs and the highest elevation point is 200 feet (61 m). The population is approximately 11,000 and the principal economy of the island is tourism.

== Geography and wildlife ==
The name Eleuthera refers both to the single Bahamian island and its associated chain of small islands, which include Harbour Island, Windermere Island, Man Island, and Current Island. Eleuthera forms part of the Great Bahama Bank on its western edge and its eastern coastline faces the Atlantic Ocean. The main island lies 80 km (50 miles) east of Nassau. It is a long and thin island; 180 km (110 miles) long and little more than 1.6 km (1.0 mile) wide at its narrowest. The island has an estimated area of 457.4 square-kilometers, and presents 336 km (210 miles) of coastline.

The topography of the island varies, including wide rolling pink sand beaches, large outcrops of ancient coral reefs, caves, and other geological features. The island features, among other flora and fauna, 13 catalogued species of native amphibian and reptile species, three of which were listed as endangered in 2000. The main island is home to a 25-acre nature preserve; the Leon Levy Native Plant Reserve, which includes an environmental education centre. The waters around Eleuthera contain an abundance of sharks and rays, which is attributed by the local Cape Eleuthera Institute to the banning of long-line fishing in local waters.

== History ==

The possible first settlers of the island were the original population of Taino, or Arawaks. An intact wooden &quot;duho&quot; or ritual seat that was made by the Taino people was found on the island of Eleuthera in the nineteenth century and is now in the collections of the British Museum. The island in its early history was known as &quot;Cigateo&quot; (or &quot;Ciguateo&quot;), meaning &quot;distant rocky land&quot;, but this name changed following subsequent European settlement.
The island is believed to have been largely unoccupied at the time of the arrival of the first significant number of British settlers, with Puritan colonists (who had come together the previous year in London) arriving in 1648 from Bermuda. These settlers, known as the &quot;Eleutherian Adventurers&quot;, under Captain William Sayle gave the island its current name which derives from the feminine form of the Greek adjective , &quot;eleutheros&quot;, meaning &quot;free&quot;. The difficulties of settlement ultimately left only a few of the settlers on the island, thwarting their aim of creating the first European &quot;democracy&quot; in the Western Hemisphere (almost 130 years prior to the American Revolution).

The island was stated to have been agriculturally prosperous in the period from 1950 to 1980. This included a large crop of pineapples for export. When the Bahamas became independent from Britain in 1973, new ownership laws changed the nature of the island economy. Since then the island has become a popular tourist destination.

In 1992 the island was severely damaged by the category 5 Hurricane Andrew; massive wind speeds hit the island and an 18-foot tidal surge inundated the coastal area. Relief efforts helped mitigate some of the damage, including several relief tasks that were carried out by HMS &quot;Cardiff&quot; as the vessel was operating in the area.

In early March 2019, Disney Cruise Line purchased the Lighthouse Point property on the island of Eleuthera and agreed to a development plan for the area with the Bahamian government. Disney spent between $250 million and $400 million on developing the 700-acre property and donated 190 acres – including the southernmost tip – to the government for a national park. The property is expected to be open for visitors on June 6, 2024.

== Demography ==

In 2000, the official census by the Government of the Bahamas recorded a population of 7,999 persons on the island. In 2010, the official census recorded the population as 8,202 spread across 2,718 separate households. At the 2010 census, the population density of the island was 57.6 persons per square mile. As of 2017, the population of the islands was said to be approximately 11,000.

== Economy and settlements ==

Settlements on the island include (north to south) the Bluff, Upper and Lower Bogue, Current, Gregory Town, Alice Town, James Cistern, Governor&#x27;s Harbour, North and South Palmetto Point, Savannah Sound, Winding Bay, Tarpum Bay, Rock Sound, Greencastle, Deep Creek, Delancy Town, Waterford, Wemyss Bight, John Millars, Millar&#x27;s and Bannerman Town.

The largest of the settlements are Governor&#x27;s Harbour (the administrative capital), Rock Sound, Tarpum Bay, Harbour Island with its unusual pink sandy beaches and Spanish Wells. The largest settlements in terms of population in Eleuthera are Dunmore Town, Spanish Wells and Rock Sound.

There is an annual Pineapple Festival in Gregory Town. Eleuthera is a destination for those interested in Bahamian history and nature, and neighbouring Harbour Island and Spanish Wells offer further tourism experiences. Natural attractions include the Glass Window Bridge, Hatchet Bay caves, and Surfer&#x27;s Beach in the north, and Ocean Hole and Lighthouse Beach at the south end. Preacher&#x27;s Cave on the north end was home to the Eleutherian Adventurers in the mid-17th century, and recent excavations have uncovered Arawak remains at the site. As of 2000, per capita GDP for the island was: $5756 Bahamian, with a chief human economic activity being tourism, and 6% of the population being involved in fishing, agriculture, or mining.

== Education ==
There are 12 primary schools (grades 1–6) on Eleuthera; Deep Creek Primary, Emma E. Cooper Primary, Governor&#x27;s Harbour Primary, Green Castle Primary, Gregory Town Primary, James Cistern Primary, Current Island Primary, North Eleuthera Primary, P.A. Gibson Primary, Rock Sound Primary, Tarpum Bay Primary, and Wemyss Bight Primary schools.

There are three public high schools (grades 7–12) on Eleuthera: North Eleuthera High in Lower Bogue, Central Eleuthera High in North Palmetto Point, and Preston Albury High in Rock Sound.

The Island School is a private secondary school in Eleuthera. The Deep Creek Middle School is an independent school on Eleuthera for grades seven to nine. The Cape Eleuthera Institute is a research and summer education institute on the main island. The Haynes Public library is located in Governors Harbour in a historical building constructed in 1897; it is the oldest Government Complex on the island.

== Transport ==

The island is reached by sea and by air links from the rest of The Bahamas. Three airports serve the island. North Eleuthera Airport, with a runway on the north part of the island and located inland. Governor&#x27;s Harbour Airport is located in the middle of the main island and has services to Nassau. Rock Sound Airport is an airport in the South Eleuthera district of the Bahamas. Its name comes from the former district of Rock Sound.

The main island has one principal road, the Queens Highway, which runs the length of the island. The road runs for a total length of . In 2009, US$13 million was given by the Bahamas government for roadworks of .

Ports and marinas open for traffic on Eleuthera include Governor&#x27;s Harbour, Current Island, Harbour Island &amp; North Eleuthera, Rock Sound, and Spanish Wells. In 2011 several improvements were carried out to the docks at Current Island to improve access for vehicular traffic, including replacement of the wooden jetty.

In 2021, the Minister of Works Desmond Bannister announced plans for a $30 million upgrade for the Glass Window Bridge. The new bridge will be constructed 18 m (60 feet) west of the existing bridge.

== U.S. military bases ==
=== NAVFAC Eleuthera ===
The United States Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Eleuthera, Bahamas was a shore terminus and processing facility for the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) operated by the U.S. Navy to detect submarines. In 1951 a six-element test array had been placed offshore to demonstrate the system&#x27;s capability to detect submarines. After successful tests with a U.S. submarine, a functional forty-element array was installed in 1952 as one of a total of nine Atlantic systems ordered. Though it was the first array to be installed, it was last to get the operational shore terminal under Navy command when NAVFAC Eleuthera was commissioned on 1 September 1957. The facility had a complement of 150 officers and enlisted men, a resident Western Electric engineer, some nineteen Pan-American Airway and RCA contractors, and 45 Bahamian employees who supported the facility. NAVFAC Eleuthera was decommissioned on 31 March 1980 after 23 years of service. It was located near Governor&#x27;s Harbour Airport. The first U.S. Navy women to be assigned to a SOSUS facility were the eleven assigned to NAVFAC Eleuthera in 1972. Seventeen years earlier the Canadian contingent of the joint U.S./Canadian Forces SOSUS facility, Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Shelburne, included five women of the Women&#x27;s Royal Canadian Naval Service.

Adjacent to the NAVFAC was the original site of the first experimental array and electronics, operated by two Western Electric engineers and a few military personnel, which continued in service as an avenue for experiments.

=== Eleuthera AAFB ===
The U.S. Air Force Eastern Test Range (ETR) Range Tracking Station No. 4 was sited at Eleuthera AAFB (ELU AUXILIARY AIR FORCE BASE), supported by contractor employees of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and Pan American Airways (PAA) in the 1960s and 1970s. This was used by the MISTRAM system.

== In popular culture ==
The island inspired a song named &quot;Eleutheria&quot; (freedom) by Lenny Kravitz in 1993. Kravitz is a resident of the island and has stated many of his songs were written while on the island. In an October 2020 interview from the island where he had been since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, he discussed the impact of the pandemic on the island and some of the crops he grows.

<doc id="951710" wikidata="Q5254438" url="?curid=951710" title="Woodlands, Singapore">
<text>Woodlands is a planning area and residential town located in the North Region of Singapore. As of 2019, the town has a population of 254,733. Located approximately north of the central business district (CBD), it is the densest planning area and the regional centre for the northern parts of the country. 

The Woodlands planning area borders Sembawang to the east, Mandai to the south and Sungei Kadut to the west. It has nine subzones; Greenwood Park, Midview, North Coast, Senoko West, Woodgrove, Woodlands East, Woodlands Regional Centre, Woodlands South and Woodlands West. 

Woodlands New Town is situated within the Woodlands planning area, which was developed during the 1980s as part of Singapore&#x27;s plan to decentralise the city centre and create self-contained residential areas throughout the country. 

Woodlands also serves as one of the two international land border connections on the Singaporean side between Singapore and Malaysia at Woodlands Checkpoint, which leads to the Johor–Singapore Causeway. The other connection is the Tuas Second Link at Tuas. 

==History==

===British administration===
The area consisting of modern-day Woodlands Town first witnessed the opening of the Johor-Singapore Causeway in 1923. Early Woodlands consisted of villages where residents made their living mostly as small-time shopkeepers and vegetable farmers in the Marsiling area, while rubber plantations and poultry farms dot the landscape at where modern-day Admiralty is located.

===Post-independence===

The first HDB flats were built from 1972 in the northern part of Marsiling, and the Woodlands Bus Interchange located at Woodlands Centre Road was built in 1980.

Prior to 1988, Woodlands was divided into Bukit Panjang SMC and Sembawang SMC, before it was merged in 1991 into Sembawang GRC due to growing development.

The development of Woodlands began in 1981. This comprises the building of HDB flats in the Neighbourhood 1, which was completed in 1985; well after the Marsiling Estate. The Neighbourhood 8 was completed in 1987, together with the Neighbourhood 3 in 1989. Because of the saturation of HDB flats, the numbering system added &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27;. Blocks 6xx in Admiralty were completed in 1996, together with the 7xx in 1997. Expansion into Innova began in 1998 and was completed in 2002, which consists of block 5xx. Expansion into the Woodlands East began in 1999 and completed in 2004.

The Jalan Ulu Sembawang is a rural road that cut across parts of the Woodlands New Town and the Sembawang Airbase. Starting from June 1992, the Jalan Ulu Sembawang is being cleared because of the extension of Woodlands New Town, Gambas Avenue, Sembawang Airbase and the Seletar Expressway. The village was cleared by 1996 and it was being converted into a military training ground.

==Neighbourhood layout==
There are three constituencies in the town, and nine neighbourhoods (N1 to N9) within the Woodlands vicinity made up primarily of Woodlands, Marsiling, Woodgrove and Admiralty. Woodlands Square serves as the town centre while adjacent neighbourhood centres also offer a variety of commercial activities. Integrated development plans including Kampung Admiralty (Admiralty Village) were officially launched in April 2014.

Of all the estates, Woodgrove is the smallest in size, located towards the southwest end of the town. Woodgrove houses most of the private housing in Woodlands, consisting of high-rise condominiums and landed properties. Woodgrove lies in between the estates of Marsiling and Woodlands.

Marsiling, Woodlands, Woodgrove and Admiralty all together form Woodlands New Town.

==Facilities==

Woodlands is diverse during the day and well lit at night. Shops, eateries, and commercial zones are evenly spread through the town, with bus and transit routes operating past midnight.

Divisions within estates are being rapidly modernised and modelled for Singapore&#x27;s standards; playgrounds, communal gardens, sheltered pavements, multi-level parking lots, barbecue-pits, recreational facilities (such as tennis courts) and trees are found nearly everywhere.

===Parks===
With the modernising process outpacing the preservation of its past, Marsiling Park (formerly Woodlands Town Garden) keeps a clear and simple agenda, to bring greenery in the right ambience with the mixture of the local ethnicities. The theme of the park revolves around the Malay and Chinese cultures, and winding through the park is Sungei Mandai Kechil, the river that extends into a lake within the park. Marsiling Park is located near to the Woodlands Checkpoint, in the Marsiling estate.

To the east of this area, bordering the polytechnic is Admiralty Park, a 27-hectare national park much of which is covered in mangrove. The most recent riverine park which opened in phases is the Woodlands Waterfront Park. It has engaged a lot of residents, especially those staying in northern Singapore. It is also linked to Admiralty Park and a 25 km Northern Explorer Park Connector Network.

Mandai Tekong Park, located at Woodlands Avenue 5, is a lawned park among residential areas consisting of a fenced off court for ball games &amp; benches with a running track.

Vista Park is located at Woodlands Drive 16 among residential areas. It is a park situated at a walking distance to Vista Point and consists of playgrounds and running tracks for recreational purposes.

===Malls===
Causeway Point, one of the largest shopping malls in Singapore, houses 250 shops and various outlets, including a cinema and two food courts. There used to be a John Little department store within the mall but it closed in 2010.

Woodlands Regional Library, the largest neighbourhood library in Singapore at the time of its launch, is operated by the National Library Board. The four-storey public library within the Woodlands Civic Centre caters to all ages and is organised according to themes of general, reference, teens, and children.

Woodlands Civic Centre is a designated centre of education, public services, and other forms of assistance for residents. The centre houses the Woodlands Regional Library, several banks, CPF Woodlands Branch, a post office, numerous merchandise and educational institutions, and restaurants.

Woods Square is a mixed use integrated commercial development with retail, F&amp;B, and a childcare centre.

===Recreation===
Sports are an emerging emphasis in the Singaporean society. Recreational facilities can be easily located around the estates and especially in parks: The Woodlands Stadium and Woodlands Swimming Complex are common places for sports enthusiasts.

Experimental styles of architecture have found their way into Woodlands, making the town a place of wonder and colour, with much integration with recreation. From the early practical designs to its modern-day luxurious manifestation, housing apartment blocks are no longer as plain as they sound; with the garnish of parks, communal gardens and décors, these blocks are pieces of art and style themselves. The centrepiece of the town, Woodlands Square, attracts a constant flow of travellers and shoppers daily. 

==Education==
, this area has a total of 12 primary schools, 10 secondary schools and a polytechnic, namely Republic Polytechnic. Educational institutions are evenly distributed throughout the estate. From newly founded schools to well-established ones, Woodlands has several top educational institutions in the northern region. Innova Junior College, located in Woodlands, merged with Yishun Junior College in 2019.

==Accessibility==

===Road===
Being located immediately across from Johor Bahru, Woodlands is highly accessible, connected by major roads and expressways. The Causeway connects to the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) at Woodlands Checkpoint to allow easy access to Woodlands and other parts of Singapore.

Land transportation in Woodlands is relatively efficient, contrasting by the amount of well-maintained roads, a common sight in Singapore. Twelve avenues support and help circulate all of the traffic of the town, especially notable ones such as Avenue 2, Avenue 3 and Avenue 12, which are connected to the expressways.

Woodlands Avenue 2 is a shorter route from the town centre and older estates to the Seletar Expressway. To connect the Woodlands Avenue 2 into the Seletar Expressway, part of the road was being built since 1998.

Woodlands Avenue 3 connects Marsiling from the exit of BKE to Woodlands Centre Road, which leads to Woodlands Checkpoint. The rest of it maintains a similar route of the MRT line, which connects to Woodlands Square.

As the avenue ends at the entrance of the slope of Woodlands Square (the road that circulates Woodlands Square), another end starts at Woodlands Avenue 7, which connects Woodlands to Admiralty, also along the route of the MRT line, ending at Gambas Avenue.

Woodlands Avenue 12 forms the southeastern border of the town, connecting the upcoming Woodlands Health Campus, office buildings as well as the neighbouring town of Sembawang to the Seletar Expressway.

&quot;Divisions&quot; within estates are further connected and regulated by two- or single lane roads called &quot;streets,&quot; which are distinguished by a suffix of double-digit numbers, such as Woodlands Street 82 and Woodlands Street 83. This was a common practice before the late &#x27;90s. &quot;Drives&quot; are two- or single lane roads built for newer divisions within an estate, similar to that of the streets.

&quot;Links&quot; and &quot;Crescents&quot; are often three-, two-, or single-lane roads that convey commuters from the main road to another main road, such as the Woodlands Link, which connects Woodlands Avenue 9 to the main roads in the Woodlands Industrial Park. &quot;Crescents&quot; connect main roads to streets or drives.

===Rail===

Residents of Woodlands are currently serviced by five Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations across two MRT lines intersecting each other, the North-South Line and Thomson-East Coast Line:

* Marsiling (in the West)
* Woodlands North (in the North)
* Woodlands (at the town centre)
* Woodlands South (in the South)
* Admiralty (in the East)

The travelling time from Woodlands MRT station to City Hall MRT station in the central business district is approximately 40 minutes.

Woodlands Train Checkpoint is linked by a shuttle train to Johor Bahru Sentral station in Malaysia across the causeway. It is planned to be replaced by a rapid transit link, the Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System, which will have its Singapore terminus at Woodlands North MRT station, improving access between Johor Bahru and Singapore.

=== Bus ===
Under the government&#x27;s plans to develop a new town centre in the geographical centre of Woodlands, the town&#x27;s bus interchange was relocated from the previous Woodlands Town Centre to the current town centre at Woodlands Square in 1996. This bus interchange, the Woodlands Regional Bus Interchange, was the first underground bus interchange in Singapore, having been built under the Woodlands MRT station. It was built this way to maximise space.

In 2016, Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange was opened to facilitate renovation work at the former bus interchange, which included connecting it to the Thomson-East Coast Line. All bus services relocated to the temporary interchange. The former bus interchange, which is now known as the Woodlands Integrated Transport Hub, had reopened on 13 June 2021 as the 11th integrated transport hub in Singapore.

==Politics==
Woodlands was under jurisdiction for two constituencies in the northern area as of the 2020 elections, namely Sembawang GRC and Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, both of which were controlled by the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party. In early days, Woodlands was mostly covered under a single constituency of Sembawang (and in 1988, as a GRC) and parts of Bukit Panjang SMC prior to the 1991 elections. Woodlands and Sembawang has since expanded into divisions for Marsiling and Woodlands in 2001, followed by Admiralty in 2006, and Woodgrove in 2011. In 2015, both Marsiling and Woodgrove were later hived out from Sembawang GRC into the new Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC due to the population growth from the neighbouring Yew Tee from the Chua Chu Kang GRC.

==Future plans==
According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority and its Master Plan for the North Region, the Woodlands Regional Centre is set to become the &quot;Northern Gateway&quot; of Singapore. Featuring some 700,000 m2 of new commercial space and more than 100 hectares of land that will be developed, the growth of the Woodlands Regional Centre will anchor the development of the North Coast Innovation Corridor. More commercial and shopping options will progressively be made available in the Woodlands Central, with a future pedestrian mall running through the heart of the district. As a significant employment cluster, the Woodlands North Coast will bring jobs and commercial opportunities closer to home for residents of the North Region. A new waterfront park will be built to connect the two districts of Woodlands Central and Woodlands North Coast. More park connectors and cycling paths will be built to connect to the 150 km Round Island Route and Rail Corridor.

<text>Georges Valois (; born Alfred-Georges Gressent; 7 October 1878 – February 1945) was a French journalist and national syndicalist politician. He was a member of the French Resistance and died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.

==Life and career==
Born in a working-class and peasant family in Paris, Georges Valois went to Singapore at the age of 17, returning to Paris in 1898. In his early years, he was an anarcho-syndicalist. He found work as a secretary at &quot;L&#x27;Humanité Nouvelle&quot; where he met Georges Sorel. Later, after a stay in Imperial Russia (1903), he worked as secretary at Armand Colin publishing house.

After having written his first book, &quot;L&#x27;Homme Qui Vient&quot; (The Coming Man), he met the nationalist and monarchist writer Charles Maurras and became a member of his &quot;Action Française&quot;, where he continued to follow the workers&#x27; movement. As his employment would have been compromised by an involvement in the far-right monarchist league, he took the pseudonym of Georges Valois.

In 1911, he created the &quot;Cercle Proudhon&quot;, a national syndicalist group, and took direction of the publishing house of the &quot;Action française&quot;, the &quot;Nouvelle librairie nationale&quot;, in 1912. The &quot;Cercle&quot; mixed Sorel&#x27;s influence with the &quot;integralism&quot; favoured by Charles Maurras and was overtly anti-Semitic. According to the historian Zeev Sternhell, that ideology was the prefiguration of Italian fascism.

In 1925, Valois founded the weekly &quot;Le Nouveau Siècle&quot; (The New Century), which was seen by Maurras as a potential rival. As a result, he lost his job at &quot;La Nouvelle librairie nationale&quot;. The rupture with Maurras became even more serious after his creation the same year of the &quot;Faisceau&quot; league.

His long-term collaborator Jacques Arthuys was one of the leaders of the new league. It was assisted by major entrepreneurs in their fight against the agitation of the French Communist Party (PCF). After some initial success (it was joined by such extremist figures as Hubert Lagardelle and Marcel Bucard), it disappeared in 1928, when Valois had already been excluded from the party. The middle class may have withdrawn its support because of its lack of confidence in fascism as a plausible solution for France or because it considered, following a trend established by the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1926 excommunicated the &quot;Action française&quot;), that the best solution was to infiltrate the Third Republic&#x27;s institutions.

Valois lost financial support, the &quot;Faisceau&quot; was dissolved, he founded the Republican Syndicalist Party (PRS). Jacques Arthuys was also a leader of the party. During the second Cartel des gauches (Left-wing Coalition), the party published the &quot;Cahiers bleus&quot; (1928–1932), which hosted essays by widely-different personalities, including Marcel Déat (a future neo-socialist who had been excluded from the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) who would later be a collaborationist), Bertrand de Jouvenel (co-founder of the Mont Pelerin Society, a liberal organisation that still exists), Pierre Mendès France (one of the young guards, or &quot;jeunes loups&quot;, of the Radical-Socialist Party who would become French Prime Minister during the Fourth Republic), and Edouard Berth.

After the 6 February 1934 crisis, Valois founded &quot;Le Nouvel Age&quot; (&quot;The New Era&quot;), which he presented as a left-wing review, along with the &quot;Cahiers bleus&quot;. However, &quot;Le Nouvel Age&quot; promoted a post-capitalist economy using a corporatist economy. In 1935, he attempted to join the SFIO, but was turned down although he was backed by Marceau Pivert.

Valois took part in the French Resistance during Vichy France. During World War II, he moved near Lyon, where he launched a cultural co-operative project. 

Valois was finally arrested by the Nazis on 18 May 1944, and died in February 1945 of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.

== Biography ==
Russell Noftsker was born February 1942 and graduated high school in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Noftsker earned a degree in engineering from New Mexico State University and was hired in 1965 by Marvin Minsky as the administrator of the Project MAC AI Group, later to become the AI Lab, replacing Dan Edwards, who had recently left that post.

=== Lisp machines and Symbolics ===
Noftsker left the Lab in 1973, but would later return to the Lab. Noftsker and Greenblatt working together with the team of Lisp Machine developers to commercialize the technology. Differences over business strategy and direction split the group from Greenblatt in February 1979. A year later Noftsker and the rest of that group formed Symbolics Inc. with Robert Adams taking on the role of president and chairman.

Noftsker and the then CEO Brian Sear were forced out of Symbolics completely by the board in early 1988 after an internal battle over lowering prices. Noftsker had already been forced to resign as president for 2 months in April 1984 by the board and again in late 1986, retained as chairman &amp; CEO the first time then as Chairman the second.

In 1995 at the invitation of Symbolics customer, Steve Gander of Princeton Capital, Noftsker joined a group which bought the assets of Symbolics out of bankruptcy.

<text>Robert Carl Takac Jr. (born September 30, 1964) is an American rock bassist and vocalist. Takac is one of the founding members of the Goo Goo Dolls, along with John Rzeznik.

==Background==
Takac was born in Buffalo, New York and grew up in the Buffalo suburb of West Seneca with his parents and younger sister. One of his grandparents was Hungarian, which is reflected by his name (originally written: Takács, which is Hungarian for &#x27;weaver&#x27;). He graduated from West Seneca East Senior High School in 1982. He graduated from Medaille College with a Communication degree, with an emphasis on Radio Broadcasting. In his college years, he played in several bands and interned and worked at a local Buffalo radio station.

In 2008, Takac was named to the Medaille College Board of Trustees.

==Music career==
Takac began his musical career as a member of the rock band Monarch, prior to joining the Beaumonts, which broke up in 1985. He met guitarist John Rzeznik through the Beaumonts and together they found a drummer, George Tutuska and started a band that they named the &quot;Sex Maggots&quot;, with Takac as the lead singer and bassist. In 1986, they changed their name to the more promotable &quot;Goo Goo Dolls&quot;, and after three albums moved Rzeznik to the majority of lead vocals. In late 1994, Takac and Rzeznik fired Tutuska and in early 1995 hired Mike Malinin as a replacement. Later that year they received their first commercial success with the single &quot;Name&quot;. The 1998 follow-up &quot;Iris&quot; reached number one on several charts, including the Hot 100 Airplay. Goo Goo Dolls have been releasing music and touring continuously since.

In 2009, the band recorded &quot;Something for the Rest of Us&quot; in Buffalo, New York, at their studio Inner Machine Studios. That year, Takac opened the studio to the public as GCR Audio.

==Side projects==
In 2003, Takac joined with Brian Schulmeister to form the dance music collective Amungus. That same year, Takac started his own record label, Good Charamel Records, in Buffalo, New York. With an initial focus on local acts, the first three bands signed to the label were Klear, The Juliet Dagger, and Last Conservative. Today the label primarily releases J-Rock music in North America by female-fronted bands such as Shonen Knife, Tsushimamire, LazyGunsBrisky, Pinky Doodle Poodle and MOLICE.

In 2004, Takac founded the Music is Art Festival, a not-for-profit organization, and operates as their president. MiA seeks to explore and reshape music&#x27;s cultural, social, and educational impact on the community. Active throughout the year, MiA is supported by a multitude of programs, concerts, and events, ranging from collecting and donating instruments to local schools, mental health awareness tours, music industry education, among others.

==Equipment==
Takac primarily plays Yamaha BB-series bass guitars, but he has also played Fender and Zon bass guitars.

<text>A cryptanalytic computer is a computer designed to be used for cryptanalysis, which nowadays involves massive statistical analysis and multiple trial decryptions that since before World War II are possible only with automated equipment. Polish cryptanalysts designed and built automated aids in their work on Enigma traffic. Arguably, the first modern computer (digital, electronic, and somewhat programmable) was built for cryptanalytic work at Bletchley Park (the Colossus) during the war. More modern computers were important after World War II, and some machines (like the Cray-1) are reported to have had machine instructions hardwired in at the request of NSA.

Computers continue to be important in cryptanalysis well into the 21st century. NSA, in fact, is said to have the largest number of installed computers on the planet. Whether this is true in an age of Google computer farms and such is doubtful but remains publicly unknown.

<text>Picture Page is a British television non-fiction programme, broadcast by the BBC Television Service from their studios at Alexandra Palace from 1936 to 1939, and again after the service&#x27;s hiatus during the Second World War from 1946 until 1952. It was the first British television series to become a long-term and regular popular success. The series proved to be very popular with viewers. A BBC survey in 1939 showed the series to be second in popularity behind plays.

==Format==

The programme had a magazine format with two hour-long editions broadcast each week including a range of interviews with well-known personalities, features about a range of topics and coverage of public events. The main presenter during the pre-war era was Canadian actress Joan Miller who played the role of a &quot;switchboard operator&quot; similar to that of a telephone exchange, &quot;connecting&quot; the viewers to the particular guests and items being featured that week. Miller was nicknamed &quot;The Switchboard Girl&quot; in the popular press and became one of the first television celebrities. She would be assisted by Leslie Mitchell and Jasmine Bligh, two of the BBC&#x27;s three continuity announcers (the other being Elizabeth Cowell).

&quot;Picture Page&quot; celebrated its 200th edition on 15 December 1938 with a &quot;huge birthday cake&quot;. At that time the show had welcomed &quot;1,450 items in which have taken part over 1,500 men, 660 women, the ghost of Alexandra Palace and a large number of animals of all kinds, including goats, snakes, lions and mice.&quot;

After the reinstatement of the programme during 1946, Joan Gilbert assumed presenting duties until 1952. Mary Malcolm presented some shows in 1949 and 1950.

==Preservation==

&quot;Picture Page&quot; was produced live by the BBC from their Alexandra Palace television studio for the entirety of its run. The first episode was actually broadcast on 8 October 1936, some three and a half weeks before the official opening of the service on 2 November, as part of the ongoing test transmissions during the prelude to the initiation date. Until 1949 the series was not recorded and thus none of the pre-1949 programmes exist anymore. Four shows from 1951 have survived in the form of telerecordings.

==Theme tune==
The theme tune &quot;Shopping Centre&quot; was composed by Philip Green.

<doc id="951727" wikidata="Q198526" url="?curid=951727" title="D-dimer">
<text>D-dimer (or D dimer) is a dimer that is a fibrin degradation product (FDP), a small protein fragment present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. It is so named because it contains two D fragments of the fibrin protein joined by a cross-link, hence forming a protein dimer.

D-dimer concentration may be determined by a blood test to help diagnose thrombosis. Since its introduction in the 1990s, it has become an important test performed in people with suspected thrombotic disorders, such as venous thromboembolism. While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not exclude other potential causes. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low.

D-dimer levels are used as a predictive biomarker for the blood disorder disseminated intravascular coagulation and in the coagulation disorders associated with COVID-19 infection. A four-fold increase in the protein is an indicator of poor prognosis in people hospitalized with COVID-19.

==Principles==

Coagulation, the formation of a blood clot or thrombus, occurs when the proteins of the coagulation cascade are activated, either by contact with a damaged blood vessel wall and exposure to collagen in the tissue space (intrinsic pathway) or by activation of factor VII by tissue activating factors (extrinsic pathway). Both pathways lead to the generation of thrombin, an enzyme that turns the soluble blood protein fibrinogen into fibrin, which aggregates into protofibrils. Another thrombin-generated enzyme, factor XIII, then crosslinks the fibrin protofibrils at the D fragment site, leading to the formation of an insoluble gel that serves as a scaffold for blood clot formation.

The circulating enzyme plasmin, the main enzyme of fibrinolysis, cleaves the fibrin gel in a number of places. The resultant fragments, &quot;high molecular weight polymers&quot;, are digested several times more by plasmin to lead to intermediate and then to small polymers (fibrin degradation products or FDPs). The cross-link between two D fragments remains intact, however, and these are exposed on the surface when the fibrin fragments are sufficiently digested. The structure of D-dimer is either a 180 kDa or 195 kDa molecule of two D domains, or a 340 kDa molecule of two D domains and one E domain of the original fibrinogen molecule. The half-life of D-dimer in blood is approximately 6 to 8 hours.

D-dimers are not normally present in human blood plasma, except when the coagulation system has been activated, for instance, because of the presence of thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation. The D-dimer assay depends on the binding of a monoclonal antibody to a particular epitope on the D-dimer fragment. Several detection kits are commercially available; all of them rely on a different monoclonal antibody against D-dimer. For some of these, the area of the D-dimer to which the antibody binds is known. The binding of the antibody is then measured quantitatively by one of various laboratory methods.

==Indications==
D-dimer testing is of clinical use when there is a suspicion of deep venous thrombosis (DVTl), pulmonary embolism (PE) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

For DVT and PE, there are possible various scoring systems that are used to determine the &quot;a priori&quot; clinical probability of these diseases; the best-known is the Wells score.
* For a high score, or pretest probability, a D-dimer will make little difference and anticoagulant therapy will be initiated regardless of test results, and additional testing for DVT or pulmonary embolism may be performed.
* For a moderate or low score, or pretest probability:
** A negative D-dimer test will virtually rule out thromboembolism: the degree to which the D-dimer reduces the probability of thrombotic disease is dependent on the test properties of the specific test used in the clinical setting: most available D-dimer tests with a negative result will reduce the probability of thromboembolic disease to less than 1% if the pretest probability is less than 15-20%. Chest computed tomography (CT angiography) should not be used to evaluate pulmonary embolism for persons with negative results of a D-dimer assay. A low pretest probability is also valuable in ruling out PE.
** If the D-dimer reads high, then further testing (ultrasound of the leg veins or lung scintigraphy or CT scanning) is required to confirm the presence of thrombus. Anticoagulant therapy may be started at this point or withheld until further tests confirm the diagnosis, depending on the clinical situation.

In some hospitals, they are measured by laboratories after a form is completed showing the probability score and only if the probability score is low or intermediate. This reduces the need for unnecessary tests in those who are high-probability. Performing the D-dimer test first can avoid a significant proportion of imaging tests and is less invasive. Since the D-dimer can exclude the need for imaging, specialty professional organizations recommend that physicians use D-dimer testing as an initial diagnostic.

==Interpretation==

===Reference ranges===
The following are reference ranges for D-dimer:
D-dimer increases with age. It has therefore been suggested to use a cutoff equal to patient’s age in years × 10 μg/L (or x 0.056 nmol/L) for patients aged over 50 years for the suspicion of venous thromboembolism (VTE), as it decreases the false positive rate without substantially increasing the false negative rate.

An alternative measurement of D-dimer is in fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU). The molecular weight of the fibrinogen molecule is about twice the size of the D-dimer molecule, and therefore 1.0 mcg/mL FEU is equivalent to 0.5 mcg/mL of d-dimer.

===Thrombotic disease===
Various kits have a 93 to 95% sensitivity (true positive rate). For hospitalized patients, one study found the specificity to be about 50% (related to false positive rate) in the diagnosis of thrombotic disease.
* False positive readings can be due to various causes: liver disease, high rheumatoid factor, inflammation, malignancy, trauma, pregnancy, recent surgery as well as advanced age.
* False negative readings can occur if the sample is taken either too early after thrombus formation or if testing is delayed for several days. Additionally, the presence of anti-coagulation can render the test negative because it prevents thrombus extension. The anti-coagulation medications dabigatran and rivaroxaban decrease D-dimer levels but do not interfere with the D-dimer assay.
* False values may be obtained if the specimen collection tube is not sufficiently filled (false low value if underfilled and false high value if overfilled). This is due to the dilutional effect of the anticoagulant (the blood must be collected in a 9:1 blood to anticoagulant ratio).
* Likelihood ratios are derived from sensitivity and specificity to adjust pretest probability.

In interpretation of the D-dimer, for patients over age 50, a value of (patient&#x27;s age) × 10 μg/L may be abnormal.

==History==
D-dimer was originally identified, described and named in the 1970s (Fibrinolysis, Dr P J Gaffney) and found its diagnostic application in the 1990s.

<doc id="951728" wikidata="Q1914835" url="?curid=951728" title="Kindersley">
<text>Kindersley is a town surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Kindersley No. 290 in west-central Saskatchewan, Canada. It is located along Highway 7, a primary highway linking Calgary, Alberta and Saskatoon, at its junction with Highway 21. With a population of 4,567 in 2021, it is an established industrial base for the resource-rich west-central region of the province and a service centre to the oil and gas industry and agriculture production.

== History ==
Kindersley was incorporated in 1910, and named after Sir Robert Kindersley, Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (1915–25) and a major shareholder in the Canadian Northern Railway, which was nationalized and amalgamated into Canadian National Railways in 1918. Canadian Northern had made Kindersley a divisional point on its line between Saskatoon and Calgary. In 2016, having sustained a population of more than 5,000 for several years (meeting the provincial criteria), the town of Kindersley applied to the province of Saskatchewan for city status. Although official census information from 2011 indicated an official population below 5,000, the town disputed the accuracy of those numbers. As of 2022, city status has yet to be granted, and as noted below the official federal census for 2021 shows its population still below the 5,000 threshold.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kindersley had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Climate==

Kindersley experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). Winters are long, cold and dry, while summers are short and warm. Precipitation is low, with an annual average of 325 mm, and is heavily concentrated in the warmer months.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Kindersley was on 5 July 1937. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 30 January 1969.

The record one-day rainfall is 77.2 mm (3 inches) on July 6, 1991. The record one-day snowfall is 21 cm (8.3 inches) on December 27, 1990.

== Economy ==

The Bakken shale oil and gas play, driven by hydraulic fracturing technologies, has contributed to Kindersley&#x27;s economy since 2009. Kindersley sells its treated municipal wastewater to a local oilfield service company to use in hydraulic fracturing.

== Kindersley Regional Park ==
Kindersley Regional Park (), founded in 1968, is located on the south side of Kindersley at Motherwell Reservoir. Amenities at the park include a campground, golf course, hiking trails, ball diamonds, fishing, and a picnic area. Non-motorised boats are permitted on the reservoir. The campground has 45 campsites with 30 amp service and six sites with 15 amps for tenting. The golf course is a 9-hole, grass greens course. It is a par 36 with a total of 3,127 yards.

==Events==

Annual events in Kindersley include the Indoor Rodeo and Trade Show in June and the four-day Goose Festival in September, among numerous sports and cultural activities throughout the rest of the year. Kindersley was chosen as the launch site for the da Vinci Project, Canada&#x27;s entry to win the Ansari X Prize. The flight was scheduled for October 2004, but circumstances related to the project prevented the flight from taking place. Kindersley celebrated its 100th birthday in 2010.

==Education==

Kindersley has three schools, all operating within the Sun West School Division. Westberry is an elementary school, Elizabeth is a middle school and the Kindersley Composite School is 9-12. There is also a regional college at the Great Plains Regional College location.

==Sports==
Kindersley is home to a full-service 9-hole golf course; two world class, fully irrigated baseball diamonds; a 3/8 mile dirt oval speedway, and the West Central Events Centre (WCEC), with two ice surfaces and a curling rink. The WCEC is home to the local SJHL Klippers hockey team. Part of the WCEC, an older arena called Exhibition Stadium, was destroyed by fire on January 8, 2010.

Kindersley has also hosted many sporting events including the 1984 World Youth Baseball Championships, 1990 Men&#x27;s Provincial Curling Championship, 1994 Saskatchewan Winter Games, 1997 Canadian Mixed Curling Championships, 2001 Men&#x27;s Provincial Curling Championships, 2007 Provincial Mixed Curling Championships, 2008 Junior Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Provincial Curling Championships, 2009 and 2010 Baseball Canada Cup and the 2010 Provincial Scotties Tournament of Hearts (the tournament was moved to Eston because of the fire on January 8, 2010).

<text>Kootenay—Columbia is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997.

Under the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution the riding will be renamed Columbia—Kootenay—Southern Rockies.

==Geography==
Consisting of:

*(a) the Regional District of East Kootenay;
*(b) that part of the Regional District of Central Kootenay comprising:
** the villages of Kaslo and Salmo;
** the Town of Creston;
** the City of Nelson;
** subdivisions A, B, C, D, E, F and G;
** Creston Indian Reserve No. 1;
*(c) that part of the Columbia-Shuswap Regional District comprising:
** the City of Revelstoke;
** the Town of Golden;
** subdivisions A and B; and
*(d) Tobacco Plains Indian Reserve No. 2.
The riding borders the US states of Idaho, Montana and Washington, more than any other Canadian riding.

==History==
This district was created in 1996 from parts of Kootenay East and Kootenay West—Revelstoke ridings.

It was amended in 2003 to include a small part of Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Kootenay—Columbia should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined Kootenay—Columbia gains the communities of Nelson, Salmo and Kaslo and their respective surrounding areas from the current electoral district of British Columbia Southern Interior, while losing Nakusp and area to the new district of South Okanagan—West Kootenay and Needles and area to the new district of North Okanagan—Shuswap. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.

==Demographics==
==Members of Parliament==
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:




===Current member of Parliament===

Its member of Parliament (MP) is Rob Morrison, first elected in 2019 as a Conservative candidate.

<doc id="951744" wikidata="Q1050154" url="?curid=951744" title="Cat Island, The Bahamas">
<text>Cat Island is located in The Bahamas, and is one of its districts. Cat Island also has the nation&#x27;s highest point, Mount Alvernia (formerly known as Como Hill). It rises to and is topped by a monastery called &quot;The Hermitage&quot;. This assembly of buildings was erected by the Franciscan &quot;Brother Jerome&quot; (John Hawes).

==History==
The indigenous Lucayan people called the island &quot;Guanima&quot;, meaning &quot;middle waters land&quot;. The first white settlers were Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution, who arrived in 1783. The island may have been named after Arthur Catt, a pirate, or may be a reference to its one-time large population of feral cats.

Historically, the island gained wealth from cotton plantations, but slash and burn farming is now the main way of life for Cat Islanders. An economic crop is &quot;Croton eluteria&quot; (called also cascarilla) bark, which is gathered and shipped to Italy where it becomes a main ingredient in medicines, scents and Campari.

Until written accounts were found, Cat Island was thought to be Guanahani or San Salvador, the first island Christopher Columbus arrived at in the Americas.

==Demographics==
The population of Cat Island is 1,522 (2010 census). The main settlements are Dumfries, New Bight, Arthur&#x27;s Town (capital settlement and childhood home of Sidney Poitier), Orange Creek, and Port Howe.

Cat Island, Tea Bay is also the birthplace of Bahamian musician Tony McKay, better known as Exuma, and MMA fighter Dada 5000.

New Bight Airport and Arthur&#x27;s Town Airport serve the island.

==Landmarks and attractions==

At the top of Como Hill is Mt. Alvernia Hermitage on Mount Alvernia, the highest point in The Bahamas. This small stone monastery built by hand by the architect hermit, Father Jerome, is at the peak and accessible by a trek up a steep rocky incline.

Just south of the Hermitage are the ruins of Armbrister Plantation.

Armbrister Creek flows into a clear lake called &quot;Boiling Point&quot; or &quot;Boiling Hole&quot; whose tidal conditions cause bubbles and burps, the conditions which lead to folklore of a sea monster below its surface. Rays and baby sharks can be found in the lake. In addition, numerous birds can be found nesting along its mangrove fringe.

Located in Bain Town is another lake. This wide deep lake called Mermaid Hole is said in local folklore to be home to a mermaid that lives amongst the 4 bed holes within that lead to caverns and passageways.

One of the major attractions in Cat Island Bahamas is the Big Blue Hole near Orange Creek at Dickies Road. The hole is very deep and it has a strong undercurrents flowing into the sea. Many objects such as dead farm animals tossed into the lake ended up reaching the ocean through its caverns. Local folklore says that a monster lived in Big Blue Hole that devours horses. This folklore is said to still scare local fisherman from venturing too far into this freshwater lake.

Dickie&#x27;s Road goes east to Griffin Bat Cave, once a hideout for slaves.

Sitting atop a ridge alongside the road in the settlement of Old Bight is St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, built by Father Jerome, with frescos, engravings and sculptures.

In the Port Howe area of Cat Island, are the ruins of an 18th-century plantation at Deveaux House mansion. It was given to Colonel Andrew Deveaux in 1783 for protecting Nassau from Spanish invasion and occupation.

In Knowles, there is a museum called the Columbus World Centre Museum. In South Bight there is the childhood home of Sir Sidney Poitier, Academy Award winner.

<text>Eduardo María González-Pondal Abente (February 8, 1835 – March 8, 1917) was a Galician (Spain) poet, who wrote in both Galician and Spanish.
==Background==
Of Hidalgo origin, Pondal was the youngest of a family of seven. From 1844 onwards he studied Latin in a school in Vilela de Nemiña which belonged to his cleric relative, Cristobal Lago. In 1848, he moved to Santiago de Compostela to study Philosophy and, afterwards, Medicine at University.

As a student, he was a regular at Liceo de Santo Agostiño, a place where literary debates took place. There, he was discovered as a poet during the banquet of Conxo. It was a banquet organized by liberal students in 1856 to honor &quot;the third state&quot;, and where students rubbed shoulders with laborers. The toasts are retrospectively considered to have an important political meaning.

In 1860, Pondal completed his studies and began working as a doctor for the Spanish Army at Ferrol. He also published A Campana de Anllóns, his first poem in the Galician language.

In 1861, he opted for an official job working for the Crown. He got the job in Asturias, but he left it, and his career as a doctor.

He would soon retire and come back to the house of his family, where he lived with regular trips to Santiago de Compostela and A Coruña (Corunna), where he visited a library called A Cova Céltica, debating with Martínez Salazar, Manuel Murguía, Florencio Vaamonde, Martelo Paumán, Urbano Lugris and others. Through Murguía, Pondal would get to know James Macpherson&#x27;s poetry, and decided to become the &quot;bardo&quot; (bard) of the Galician nation, becoming the guide and interpreter of the route it would follow.

He published&quot; Rumores de los pinos&quot; in 1877, a compilation of 21 poems in Galician and Spanish, which would become the basis for &quot;Queixumes dos pinos&quot; (1886). One of the poems in Galician, &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;The Pines&quot;) would become the lyrics for the Galician national anthem, with music by Pascual Veiga.

Pondal considered himself a &quot;poet of freedom&quot;, wanting to raise his people. He imagined a past of freedom and independence, which he tried to recover with his poetry, renewing History. Galician-Celtic mythology was almost completely lost in those days, so Pondal had to guess and re-invent it, based on Ossian&#x27;s poetry, quotations from the &quot;Leabhar Gabala&quot; and Murguia&#x27;s analysis. Pondal created a fragmentary mythology, using as his archetypes o Heroe (the hero) and o Bardo (the bard). He invented historic characters, like Ourens (trying to create a hero whose name would become the basis for the city of Ourense). Due to the poetic nature of his epic, Pondal&#x27;s mythology would never become as complete or exhaustive as J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s.

Pondal tried to restore the Galician language in a time in which it lacked social status. Nature and women are the keys of his production. From a linguistic perspective, Pondal tried to mix the populist style of the Galician of his time, with different scholarly terms in the lexicon and syntax.

He tried to write a long epic poem, &quot;Os Eoas&quot;, based on the discovery of the Americas, but he was never satisfied with his work and only published a first draft in 1858.

Pondal died in La Luguesa hotel in A Coruña on 8 March 1917. He was buried in San Amaro cemetery.

Galician Literature Day () was dedicated to Pondal in its third year, 1965.

<text>Bidirectional texture function (BTF) is a 6-dimensional function depending on planar texture coordinates (x,y) as well as on view and illumination spherical angles. In practice this function is obtained as a set of several thousand color images of material sample taken during different camera and light positions.

The BTF is a representation of the appearance of texture as a function of viewing and illumination direction. It is an image-based representation, since the geometry of the surface is unknown and not measured. BTF is typically captured by imaging the surface at a sampling of the hemisphere of possible viewing and illumination directions. BTF measurements are collections of images. The term BTF was first introduced in and similar terms have since been introduced including BSSRDF and SBRDF (spatial BRDF). SBRDF has a very similar definition to BTF, i.e. BTF is also a spatially varying BRDF.

To cope with a massive BTF data with high redundancy, many compression methods were proposed.

Application of the BTF is in photorealistic material rendering of objects in virtual reality systems and for visual scene analysis, e.g., recognition of complex real-world materials using bidirectional feature histograms or 3D textons.

Biomedical and biometric applications of the BTF include recognition of skin texture.

<doc id="951765" wikidata="Q6782348" url="?curid=951765" title="Masahiko Nomi">
<text>Masahiko Nomi (能見 正比古 &quot;Nomi Masahiko&quot;, July 18, 1925 – October 30, 1981) was a Japanese journalist who advocated Takeji Furukawa&#x27;s idea of an influence of blood type on personality. He was also known as a sumo essayist.

==History==
Nomi was born in Kanazawa, Ishikawa in 1925. He graduated from the engineering faculty of University of Tokyo, and after the graduation he enrolled to the law faculty of the same university. During this time he started his career as a writer.

His first book on the subject, &quot;Ketsueki-gata de Wakaru Aisho&quot; (&quot;Understanding Affinity by Blood Type&quot;) became a best seller in 1971. He wrote more than ten popular books. After his death in 1981, his son, Toshitaka Nomi (October 19, 1948 – September 27, 2006) inherited the study. He established the Human Science ABO Center in 2004.

==Blood Type Humanics==

===History=== 
Blood-type research carried out during the 1920s and &#x27;30s in Germany, ostensibly focused on how to recognise blood of non-Aryan origins during the newly emerging medical procedure of blood transfusions, resurfaced in &quot;Age of Aquarius&quot;-era Japan. Removing the ethno-racial aspect, Nomi focused instead on the idea that blood types are linked to specific character types and behaviour patterns, then went on to write a book around what he termed Blood Type Humanics (血液型人間学). The book was hugely popular in Japan with the core idea of &quot;blood type = personality type&quot; becoming firmly embedded in Japanese popular culture and the cultures of other East Asian countries. While seeming quaint and harmless, cases of Japanese workers finding themselves on the receiving end of workplace issues arising from being of the &quot;wrong&quot; blood type is common enough for the phrase &quot;bura hara&quot; (&quot;ブラハラ&quot;), an abbreviation of &quot;blood harassment&quot;, to have been coined.

===Overview===
A humorous simile of foods was introduced to help people get an image easily. He compared the human being as vegetables. In this way, there are a lot of kinds of vegetables, therefore there are various kinds of personalities for the same blood type. Type O people are fresh vegetables. Personalities of type O appears most, because fresh vegetables are not processed therefore variety is the richest among four blood types.
Type A people are pickles. Properties of original vegetables remain even if fresh vegetables are processed to pickles. However, common properties of pickles do not change even if properties of fresh vegetables are controlled to a certain degree by processing.

Type B people are boiled (and seasoned) vegetables. As well as type A, common properties of boiled vegetables comes out. In addition, variety of personality decreases like type A to some extent compared to fresh vegetables. Type AB people are &quot;boiled pickles&quot;—called &quot;fukujinzuke (福神漬)&quot; in Japan. Of course, variety of personality is the poorest among four blood types.

Therefore, he often said that blood type can explain only &quot;a quarter&quot; of human personality. Personality comes from both nature (blood type) and nurture. As each vegetable has its own nature, half-and-half each makes a quarter.

<text>Arno Peters (22 May 1916 – 2 December 2002) was a German historian who developed the Peters world map, based on the Gall–Peters projection.

==Biography==

Peters was born in Berlin. In childhood he lived in Berlin, Germany, with his brother, Werner and his parents Lucy and Bruno. The family often entertained foreign guests, and he was exposed to social activism because of his parents&#x27; role in the labor union movement. His father was briefly incarcerated by the Nazi regime toward the end of World War II. Peters competed as both a cyclist and a swimmer in high school, receiving titles in both.

Peters began his career in Hollywood in the late 1930s, studying American filmmaking. Returning to Germany after studying film in Hollywood, Peters was able to improve the German production process, and in 1940 he released a film of his own, &quot;Immer Nur Du&quot;, a modern musical. At the age of 25 he was the youngest German filmmaker of the time.

After attaining his doctorate from the Friedrich-Wilhelm University in history of art and journalism in 1945, Peters began his academic research of synchronoptic world history. This topic was introduced to him during college and formed a large part of his dissertation, titled &quot;Film as a Means of Public Leadership&quot;. Though Peters discussed his world map as early as 1967, he did not start promoting it until a press conference in Bonn in May 1973.

In 1974 Peters founded the Institute for Universal History in Bremen, Germany, where he served as director. He was awarded an honorary professorship by the University of Bremen and worked in Bremen until his death on 2 December 2002. Peters is buried in a cemetery in the city, and his black marble gravestone is a plinth with a globe on top.

==Work==
Spurred by his interest in political propaganda, he spent much of his academic life studying synchronoptic world history, which focuses on all areas of the world equally. Out of these studies came his &quot;synchronoptic world history&quot; timeline, devoting the same space to all areas and times of the world simultaneously, spanning 1000 BC to 1952 AD, based on the theory that viewing all civilizations and countries concurrently shows relationships and influences that might not otherwise be obvious. Published in 1952, it presaged his world map. In these activities Peters developed a belief in the Eurocentric bias of most maps. Since he could not find a map that satisfied him, Peters developed one himself. In 1974 he announced the Peters world map, claiming it was the most accurate representation of the world. The map engendered controversy. The map projection Peters claimed to have developed had been presented more than a century earlier by the Reverend James Gall, and, despite Peters&#x27;s claims, the projection was not the first or only equal-area projection. Many other of his claims were disputed or debunked. Despite criticism, over 80 million of Peters&#x27;s maps have been distributed worldwide. In 1989 Peters published &quot;The Peters Atlas of the World&quot;, which at the time was the only atlas that represented all areas on about the same scale.

<text>Breogán (also spelt Breoghan, Bregon or Breachdan) is a character in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, a medieval Christian history of Ireland and the Irish (or Gaels). He is supposedly the son of Brath, and is described as an ancestor of the Gaels. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; purports to be an account of how the Gaels descend from Adam through the sons of Noah and how they came to Ireland.

It tells us that they spent 440 years wandering the Earth and underwent a series of trials and tribulations. Eventually, they sail to Iberia and conquer it. There, one of their leaders, Breogán, founds a city called Brigantia and builds a great tower. From the top of the tower, his son Íth glimpses Ireland. The Gaels, including some of Breogán&#x27;s sons, sail to Ireland from Brigantia and agree to divide it between them and the Tuatha Dé Danann, the Irish pagan gods, who take the Otherworld. Brigantia probably refers to A Coruña in present-day Galicia and Breogán&#x27;s tower is probably based on the Tower of Hercules (which was built at A Coruña by the Romans) or the Tower of Babel. The idea that the Irish Gaels came from Hispania may be based on the similarity of the names &quot;Iberia&quot; and &quot;Hibernia&quot; and the names &quot;Galicia&quot; and &quot;Gael&quot;. Medieval pseudo-historians made similar claims about other nations based on their names. A similar story about a monk who voyaged to a marvelous island he saw from the top of the tower of Brigantia was written in the first years of the eleventh century in Galicia. The story, preserved in two 14th-century manuscripts, is known as &quot;Trezenzonii de Solistitionis Insula Magna&quot; (&quot;Trezenzonius&#x27; Great Island of the Solstice&quot;). His son was Bile, who was in turn the father of Milesius (also called &quot;Míl Espáine&quot;, soldier of Hispania or Spain), said to be the ancestor of the Irish people. Although this is generally regarded as myth, the conquering of Ireland by people coming from the Iberian peninsula in prehistoric times fits in with a genetic study conducted in 2006 at Oxford University, which concluded that the majority of people in the British Isles are actually descended from neolithic farmers coming from the coastal north regions of Spain.

The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; was a hugely popular and influential work. Galicia itself is sometimes described poetically as the &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Nation&quot; of Breogán (in Galician, the &quot;fogar&quot; or &quot;nazón de Breogán&quot;). The land is so described in the anthem of Galicia, &quot;Os Pinos&quot;.
A large statue of Breogán stands near the Tower of Hercules in Coruña. The professional basketball club of the Galician city of Lugo is called CB Breogán in its honor. In the Spanish capital Madrid, there is a park called Parque de Breogán, named after this legendary figure.

==Sons==
Breogán had nine other sons besides Bile father of Milesius. Of these, Íoth came to Ireland first and was murdered by the sons of Cermait, prompting his family to arrive for revenge. Íoth&#x27;s son Lughaidh is commemorated in the placename Corca Luighe, and Íoth&#x27;s brothers in other placenames: Breogha, Cuailgne, Muirtheimhne, and Cualu in the territories of their descendant peoples; Fuad, Bladh, and Eibhle in mountains (Sliabh Fuaid in the Fews, Slieve Bloom, and Slieve Felim respectively) and Nár in &quot;Ros Náir&quot; in Slieve Bloom and &quot;Cathair Náir&quot; in Slieve Mish. Through Bile, Breogán is the 46th great-grandfather of Conn Cétchathach and thus the ancestor of the Connachta if the legends are to be believed.

<text>The Octagon Theatre is a producing theatre located in Bolton, Greater Manchester, England.

==Programme==
The Octagon produces eight or nine professional theatre productions each year in its Main Auditorium. Productions come from a wide range of types and genres, including classic drama, contemporary plays, comedies and musicals.

In recent years, the Octagon has specialized in producing great American drama, including works by Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams.

The Octagon also runs its Bolton season, which runs alongside the season of plays in the Main Auditorium, with events investigating or complementing the main season. This ranges from professional practical workshops to full-day Investigate Days with casts and creative teams.

The Octagon also plays host to touring shows, including touring theatre, children&#x27;s plays, and stand-up comedy.

==Performance spaces==
The Octagon has two performance spaces:
* The Main Auditorium, a flexible performance space which can present work in three configurations (in-the-round, thrust, and end-stage) and has a capacity of 300 to 400. Over the course of the season, the Octagon often presents work in all of these configurations. The Main Auditorium has a hexagonal shape, but was named the Octagon Theatre because there was an existing Hexagon Theatre in Reading. Confusingly, the Johnson Hall, in Yeovil, changed its name to the Octagon Theatre as well. The theatre&#x27;s logo, originally an octagon, has been replaced with a circle, to represent a theatre being in-the-round. 
* The Bill Naughton Studio Theatre, a studio theatre with a capacity of 100. This smaller space provides a venue for new and adventurous theatre, educational, and youth performances.

==History==
The Octagon Theatre was opened on 27 November 1967 by Princess Margaret. The town council and the theatre management were officially advised that the Royal party would need no &#x27;comfort facility&#x27;, they installed a lavish loo with gold-plated fittings. Having only ever been used officially by the plumbers who needed to test it, it was completely stripped out and turned into an office space after the official opening . 
The first theatre production was &quot;Annie and Fanny&quot; by local playwright Bill Naughton.

The building was designed by Geoffrey H. Brooks, Bolton&#x27;s Director of Architecture, and was constructed for £95,000 using money raised by public donation. It was the first professional theatre to be built in North West England following World War II. The building is hexagon in shape but was named The Octagon Theatre to avoid confusion with an existing Hexagon Theatre.
In 1987 the building was extended to add a studio theatre, originally called the Octopus Studio. In 1994 this space was enlarged and renamed The Bill Naughton Theatre, in honour of Naughton.

In the late eighties Farnworth born playwright Jim Cartwright was the Octagon&#x27;s writer in residence. His plays &quot;Two&quot; and &quot;Bed&quot; were premiered at the theatre.

In 1998 the Octagon was refurbished using funds from an Arts Council Lottery award. This improved the theatre&#x27;s seating systems and disability access, and allowed the construction of a new room for business hospitality, and a more spacious bar.

In 1999 a financial crisis threatened to force the Octagon to cease producing its own plays and become a receiving house for touring shows. Local people founded the Support Campaign for the Octagon Theatre, and under the slogan &quot;Keep theatre made in Bolton&quot; collected 12,000 signatures and organised several support events, including a protest march through the town centre and two benefit concerts. Financial commitments were obtained from funders and business sponsors, and the Octagon&#x27;s status as a producing theatre was secured.

In 2016, the then-Artistic Director, David Thacker, revived Jim Cartwright&#x27;s &quot;Two&quot; at the theatre, before staging Cartwright’s new follow-up, &quot;Two 2&quot;.

In 2017 The Octagon celebrated its 50th Birthday, with a 50th anniversary season and birthday party. The 50th anniversary season included classic productions such as Jane Eyre (18 January-10 February 2018) and a Christmas Carol (17 November 2017- 13 January 2018).

In 2018 the Octagon closed its doors until 2020 for a major refurbishment. Performances still continued off site around various Bolton venues. The first performance off the Octagon&#x27;s premises was the comedy Summer Holiday (31 May- 23 June 2018), which took place on the buses throughout Bolton.

The Octagon reopened in May 2021 following a major redevelopment, funded by Bolton Council and Arts Council England.

<text>Rollmops () are pickled herring fillets, rolled into a cylindrical shape, often around a savoury filling.

==Presentation==

The filling usually consists of onion and sliced pickled gherkin. Rollmops are often skewered with a cocktail skewer.

Rollmops are usually bought ready-to-eat, in jars or tubs. The brine additionally consists of water, white vinegar, and salt; it may also contain sugar or other sweetening agents, onion rings, peppercorns and mustard seeds. Rollmops can be eaten cold, without unrolling, or on bread. After the jar has been opened, they will usually keep for two to three weeks if kept cool or refrigerated. Rollmops are sometimes served with Labskaus.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;rollmops&quot; is German in origin, derived from the words &quot;rollen&quot; (to roll) and &quot;Mops&quot; meaning pug or &quot;fat young boy&quot;. The form &quot;Rollmops&quot; () is singular, and the plural is &quot;Rollmöpse&quot; ().

In English, the term &quot;rollmops&quot; is often treated as the plural of the singular &quot;rollmop&quot;. There is also a theory that the term &quot;roll-&#x27;em-ups&quot; became &quot;rollmops.&quot; The form &quot;rollmop herrings&quot; is also attested.

==Origins==
Pickled herring has been a staple in Northern Europe since medieval times, being a way to store and transport fish, especially necessary in meatless periods like Lent. The herring would be prepared, then packed in barrels for storage or transportation.

Rollmops grew popular throughout Germany during the Biedermeier period of the early 19th century and were known as a particular specialty of Berlin, like the similar pickled herring dish &quot;Bismarckhering&quot;. A crucial factor in their popularity was the development of the long-range railway network, which allowed the transport of herring from the North and Baltic seas to the interior. The fish was pickled to preserve it and transported in wooden barrels. In pubs in Old Berlin, it was common to have high-rising glass display cases known as &quot;Hungerturm&quot; (meaning &quot;hunger tower&quot;) on the bar to present ready-to-eat dishes like lard bread, salt eggs, meatballs, &quot;mettwurst&quot;, and of course rollmops. Nowadays rollmops are commonly served as part of the German &quot;Katerfrühstück&quot; (hangover breakfast) which is believed to restore some electrolytes.

==Distribution==
Rollmops are eaten in Europe and South America, as well as in areas of the United States and Canada. It is also a sought-after delicacy in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town and the greater Western Cape Province. In Czechia and Slovakia rollmops (&quot;zavináč&quot;) are so well known that they gave rise to the name for the @ sign.

<text>Väsen is a Swedish folk music band from Uppsala, founded in 1989, consisting of Olov Johansson (nyckelharpa) and Mikael Marin (viola). Previous members include André Ferrari (percussion) and founding member Roger Tallroth (guitar), the latter of whom announced his departure from the band in 2020 to focus on new projects. they have released 20 albums, featured on others, and have toured every year also outside of Europe. Since 2002, however, performances outside Sweden have tended to not include André Ferrari, owing to his reluctance to tour internationally and the economic advantage of a trio. Since then, Väsen has released eight albums (&quot;Trio&quot;, &quot;Keyed Up&quot;, &quot;Live in Japan&quot;, &quot;Väsen Street&quot;, &quot;Mindset&quot;, &quot;Live på Gamla Bion&quot;, &quot;Brewed&quot;, &amp; &quot;Rule of 3&quot;) in this “strings-only” format.

The band played on Nordman&#x27;s debut album in 1994. On the Finnish group JPP&#x27;s album &quot;String Tease&quot;, they were guest artists on two of the tracks.

<text>Adrián Zsolt Annus (born 28 June 1973 in Szeged) is a Hungarian hammer thrower, who was stripped of his gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens for a doping violation in a highly publicized scandal. The disqualification received heightened attention, as it came on the heels of several drug scandals at the Athens Games and came as Annus&#x27; teammate, discus thrower Róbert Fazekas was also stripped of his Olympic title for a doping violation. The incident also received attention, as Annus refused for several months to return his gold medal, relenting only after the International Olympic Committee put pressure on the Hungarian Olympic Committee and threatened sanctions.

==Career==
Annus grew up in Gyula and moved to Szombathely in 1989. His first coach was Géza Annus, but joined Haladás VSE, the Szombathely sports club after his move. At Haladás Gyula Simon coached him, before Pál Németh took over. His first significant result came in 1992, when he finished eleventh in the discus throw at the World Junior Championship in Seoul.

In 1998, Adrián Annus finished eighth in the hammer at the European Championships in Budapest. This strong showing made Annus a potential contender for a medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, but he was initially left out of the team due to stiff competition for a spot on the team. He eventually received a spot on the team due to an injury, but was not in top form to be a real contender and finished seventeenth.

Following the 2000 Olympics, Annus broke with his coach, Pál Németh, and joined József Vida.

2002 and 2003 were among his best years. In 2002 he won the European Championship and in 2003 he took silver at the World Championship. He also won the 2003 World Athletic Final. This achievement earned him the title 2003 Hungarian Sportsman of the Year.

== Drug scandal==
In 2004, Annus was favored to win in Athens, but was stripped of his medal just a few days after winning, losing the gold medal to Koji Murofushi. The International Olympic Committee concluded, that his urine samples—taken before and after competition—showed evidence of belonging to different people, therefore indicating tampering. The IOC also attempted to test Annus shortly after his competition in Athens, but Annus refused the test, which by itself warranted his disqualification.

The IOC never officially concluded how it was possible for Annus to provide samples that belonged to different people, but track and field insiders said he likely used a device, which included a container for urine and a fake penis and emptied the container into the testing bottle when required to provide a sample.

Following a rejected appeal and a hearing by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Annus was banned for two years. Following the ban, Annus began training and started competing in 2007.

<doc id="951804" wikidata="Q418459" url="?curid=951804" title="Bilobalide">
<text>Bilobalide is a biologically active terpenic trilactone present in &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;.

==Chemistry==
Bilobalide is a main constituent of the terpenoids found in Ginkgo leaves. It also exists in minor amounts in the roots. It is a sesquiterpenoid, i.e. it has a 15-carbon skeleton. Its exact synthesis pathway from farnesyl pyrophosphate is still unknown.

==Biosynthesis==
Bilobalide and ginkgolide have similar biosynthetic pathways. Bilobalide is formed by partially degraded ginkgolide. Bilobalide is derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is formed by addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to an isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) unit to form a C15 sesquiterpene. Such formation went through the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate MEP pathway. In order to generate bilobalide, C20 ginkgolide 13 must form first. To transform from GGPP to abietenyl cation 5, a single bifunctional enzyme abietadiene synthase E1 is required. However, due to the complexity of ginkgolide structures for rearrangement, ring cleavage, and formation of lactone rings, diterpene 8 is used to explain instead. Levopimaradiene 6 and abietatriene 7 are precursors for ginkgolide and bilobalide formation. The unusual tert-butyl substituent is formed from A ring cleavage in 9. Bilobalide 13 then formed in loss of carbons through degradation from ginkgolide 12, and lactones are formed from residual carboxyl and alcohol functions. The end product of bilobalide contains sesquiterpenes and three lactones units.

==Pharmacology==
Bilobalide is important for producing several of the effects of &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; extracts, and it has neuroprotective effects, as well as inducing the liver enzymes CYP3A1 and CYP1A2, which may be partially responsible for interactions between ginkgo and other herbal medicines or pharmaceutical drugs. Bilobalide has recently been found to be a negative allosteric modulator at the GABAA and GABAA-rho receptors. Of GABAA, it may possibly be selective for the subunits predominantly implicated in cognitive and memory functioning such as α1.

<doc id="951813" wikidata="Q276399" url="?curid=951813" title="José Antonio Reyes">
<text>José Antonio Reyes Calderón (; 1 September 1983 – 1 June 2019) was a Spanish professional footballer who played mainly as a left winger and also as a forward.

He made his debut for Sevilla aged 16 and signed for English club Arsenal in January 2004, winning the Premier League and FA Cup in his spell in London. He returned to Spain in September 2006, on loan with Real Madrid, where he won La Liga. He then moved to Atlético Madrid, and won the Europa League twice. He also had a short loan spell in Portugal with Benfica, before re-joining Sevilla late in his career and winning the Europa League another three times, reaching a record individual total of five. He later had spells with Espanyol, Córdoba, Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard and Extremadura.

Reyes earned 21 caps for Spain, and played at the 2006 World Cup. He died in June 2019 at the age of 35 in a car crash.

==Club career==
===Sevilla===
Born in Utrera, Province of Seville to Romani parents, Reyes joined the youth ranks of local Sevilla at the age of ten, and went on to represent the club at all youth levels.

Reyes finally signed a full contract in 1999, making his first-team debut during the 1999–2000 season at the age of 16, against Real Zaragoza. He was later called up to Spain&#x27;s squad for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship, where he scored one goal in the group stage.

With the Andalusians now in Segunda División, Reyes added another appearance. After they were promoted, he established his reputation as a versatile attacking unit in the following years, his 21 La Liga goals over four seasons leading to other teams taking notice.

===Arsenal===
Despite Sevilla manager Joaquín Caparrós&#x27;s wishes to retain him, Reyes signed with English side Arsenal during the January transfer window of the 2003–04 campaign. A £10.5 million transfer fee was negotiated with bonuses, depending on the success of Arsenal, which eventually rose to £17 million.

He made his debut on 1 February 2004 in a 2–1 win over Manchester City, and two days later he scored an own goal against Middlesbrough in the Football League Cup. Later that month, he netted twice against Chelsea to knock them out of the FA Cup; he also scored against the latter opponent in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League, and his goals in the penultimate two games helped Arsenal accomplish their unbeaten season in the Premier League.

Hat-tricks in friendlies during summer 2004 showed Reyes&#x27; improvement, and he was a prominent influence on his team&#x27;s impressive start to 2004–05, in which he managed to score in each of the first six matches. He was named as the Premier League Player of the Month for August 2004; however, he struggled midway through the season and performed inconsistently overall.

In early 2005, Reyes was reported to be homesick while at Arsenal, even though his parents, Mari and Francisco, as well as brother Jesús lived with him in England. During a prank call perpetrated by Cadena COPE in February 2005, a prankster claiming to be Emilio Butragueño, director of football of Real Madrid, speaking on behalf of the president, reportedly called the player&#x27;s agent and spoke to him about a possible transfer deal. In the ensuing conversation, the latter allegedly declared that life in London was far from what he had envisioned and he would welcome a move back to his country; he also supposedly said that he wanted out of the club as there were &quot;bad people&quot; at Arsenal.

On 21 May 2005, Reyes became only the second player in history (after Kevin Moran) to be sent off in an FA Cup final, when he was dismissed for a second yellow card shortly before the end of extra time against Manchester United, though his team still went on to win the game in a penalty shootout. He temporarily ended speculation about a move away from Highbury in July, when he signed a new six-year contract and declared that he was &quot;looking forward to having many more successful years at the club.&quot;

Reyes featured heavily in the Gunners&#x27; 2005–06 Champions League run, against, among others, Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, coming on as a substitute in the final against Barcelona, which Arsenal lost 2–1. However, in August 2006, he expressed a desire not to play in the club&#x27;s Champions League qualifying match against Dinamo Zagreb – to do so would render him &#x27;cup-tied&#x27; and complicate a move to Real Madrid; manager Arsène Wenger left him out of the side, thus fuelling speculation that a transfer was soon to be agreed.

===Loan to Real Madrid===
Reyes was linked to Real Madrid along with Arsenal teammate Cesc Fàbregas in the summer of 2006, when presidential candidate Arturo Baldasano claimed he would sign both if elected. After making two official statements on Arsenal&#x27;s website denying media reports of being unhappy, alleged quotes from Reyes in the Spanish press contradicted his denials. This tested the patience of Wenger, who reacted angrily to Real Madrid&#x27;s attempts to unsettle his player, suggesting that it was not the first time that club had used the media and agents in Spain as a destabilising tactic; shortly before the closure of the transfer window, the teams agreed to exchange him for Brazilian international Júlio Baptista, each on a season-long loan deal.

Reyes scored his first goal for Real on 17 September 2006, with a free kick against Real Sociedad, in a 2–0 home win. On the final day of the season, the focus was on soon-to-be-departed David Beckham and Roberto Carlos, but Reyes, brought from the bench for injured Beckham, netted twice as Real came from behind to beat Mallorca and claim yet another league title.

Real Madrid appointed former Getafe coach Bernd Schuster on 8 July 2007, increasing the chances that Reyes would sign a permanent deal and stay in Spain.

===Atlético Madrid===

Reports surfacing on 29 July 2007 indicated that cross-town rivals Atlético Madrid were on the verge of landing Reyes. Later that day, Wenger confirmed that the player&#x27;s departure was imminent, and that a more specific announcement would be made shortly. The following day, he passed his medical and penned a four-year deal reportedly worth €12 million, scoring and assisting once on his debut for a 3–1 defeat of Lazio in the annual Amsterdam Tournament (while at Arsenal, he was named the tournament&#x27;s MVP in its 2004 edition); his first campaign with the &quot;Colchoneros&quot; was disastrous, as he was often kept out of the side by Maxi Rodríguez and Simão Sabrosa and failed to score a single goal in 26 league appearances.

On 7 August 2008, Benfica announced the signing of Reyes on a one-year loan – the Portuguese also bought 25% of his playing rights for a fee of €2.65 million, and ensured a buying option of the remainder 75% for an undisclosed fee. His first goal for the Lisbon club was scored against city rivals Sporting CP, on 27 September: after an understanding between Reyes and Pablo Aimar and a pass from the same, he scored in fashion. Later in the same week he found the net again, against Napoli, helping to a 2–0 home victory in the first round of the UEFA Cup.

Reyes&#x27; return to Atlético proved to be much more successful, as he re-united with Quique Sánchez Flores, his manager at Benfica from the previous season. He scored his first official goal in Spain in more than two years on 9 January 2010, with a long-range effort at Real Valladolid, in a 4–0 win– by then, he had beaten the competition of Maxi and started in the wings alongside Simão. On 14 February 2010 he put in a Player of the match performance in Atlético&#x27;s 2–1 victory against Barcelona, setting up the opening goal for Diego Forlán in the eventual champions&#x27; only league defeat of the season. Four days later, in the Europa League 1–1 home draw with Galatasaray, he scored a stunning free kick from the right wing on the 22nd minute, after he was brought down just outside the box (3–2 aggregate win). On 28 March, he curled in a left-footed shot from the right wing just inside the box, opening the score in the Madrid derby against his former team in an eventual 3–2 loss.

On 27 August 2010, Reyes opened the 2–0 win over Inter Milan in the UEFA Super Cup after a one-two combination with Argentine Sergio Agüero. His first league goal of the campaign came in a 4–1 defeat at Hércules on 10 January 2011, which inspired an impressive run of scoring form, with goals in successive home games in February/March, against Valencia, former club Sevilla and Villarreal.

Reyes took up more responsibility for 2011–12, and established himself as one of the team&#x27;s most important players. On 28 July 2011, he scored twice for Atlético in a 2–1 Europa League win against Strømsgodset. A week later, in the second leg, he was again on the scoresheet and also got an assist for Adrián López in a 2–0 away victory; he struggled to find the consistency he had under Flores and, following a fallout with new coach Gregorio Manzano after being substituted in a 3–0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao, his playing time became more and more limited.

===Return to Sevilla===

On 5 January 2012, Sevilla confirmed the signing of Reyes, who agreed to a contract until June 2015. He played his first game three days later, starting in a 2–1 away loss against Rayo Vallecano, and scored his only goal of the season on 5 May, in a 5–2 win in the reverse fixture. His first goals of the following campaign came on 18 November 2012, through a first-half brace in a 5–2 Seville derby rout of Real Betis – the opening goal came after eleven seconds.

Reyes scored two goals in 12 Europa League matches as Sevilla won the tournament in 2013–14, including one in the second leg of their last-16 win over city rivals Betis. On 27 May 2015, in the final of the following season&#x27;s tournament, reportedly his final game for the club, he captained and assisted Carlos Bacca&#x27;s first of two goals as the team came from behind to defeat Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk 3–2 in Warsaw. However, he remained, starting as skipper in the ensuing Super Cup against Barcelona in Tbilisi and scoring once his side came from 4–1 down to take the game to extra time, but lose nonetheless.

Reyes netted twice as Sevilla advanced to the final of the Copa del Rey, including once in a 4–0 home win over Betis for the round of 16. He missed the final weeks of competition after undergoing surgery to his appendix, and on 1 June 2016 it was announced the 32-year-old would be released upon the expiration of his contract.

===Espanyol===
On 28 June 2016, Reyes joined Espanyol on a two-year deal, reuniting with Flores. He made his debut on 20 August, featuring 21 minutes in a 4–6 loss away to his previous team on the opening day of the season.

Reyes scored his first goal for the &quot;Pericos&quot; on 29 November 2016 in another cameo from the bench, to assure a 1–1 draw at Alcorcón in the first leg of the domestic cup&#x27;s last-32 stage. On 21 January 2017, this time as a starter, he opened his league account in a 3–1 win over Granada at the RCDE Stadium.

In June 2017, Reyes left the club at the expiry of his contract.

===Later career===
On 30 January 2018, 34-year-old Reyes signed for second division side Córdoba. Four months later, he joined Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard from the China League One on a free transfer.

Reyes returned to Spain and its second tier in January 2019, rejoining former Sevilla teammate Diego Capel at Extremadura and agreeing to a five-month deal.

==International career==
Reyes won his first full cap for Spain on 6 September 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute during a 3–0 friendly win against Portugal in Guimarães. On 11 October, again coming from the bench, this time for Vicente, he scored twice in the final three minutes of a 4–0 victory in Armenia for the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifiers, but was left out of Iñaki Sáez&#x27;s final squad.

Two years later, Reyes was picked for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but only took part in one match – the 1–0 group stage win over Saudi Arabia, with Spain already qualified in first place. He was again overlooked for the victorious Euro 2008 tournament, as manager Luis Aragonés preferred the likes of David Silva and Santi Cazorla on the wings.

Reyes also appeared once for the Andalusia regional team.

==Personal life and death==
Reyes married Noelia López in June 2017. Together, they had two daughters, Noelia and Triana.

Reyes also had a son, José Antonio Jr., from a previous relationship. His son signed for Real Madrid in June 2019, aged 11.

On 1 June 2019, Reyes died at the age of 35 following a car accident while travelling between Utrera and Seville with his cousins, Jonathan Reyes, who also died, and Juan Manuel Calderón, who was taken to a hospital in serious condition. According to the police, the car had been traveling between 111 km/h (69 mph) and 130 km/h (81 mph) and potentially suffered a steering or tyre failure. This report disputed the earlier claims that the car was speeding at 220 km/h (135 mph).

Many footballers and his former clubs offered their condolences to Reyes&#x27; family, and a moment of silence was observed at the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final, played in Madrid later that day. His funeral took place on 3 June in his hometown of Utrera, and his last team Extremadura retired his shirt number 19 shortly after; in February 2020 this number was erroneously given to Chinese new signing Gao Leilei, with the error being later rectified.

<text>OMON is a system of military special police units within the Armed Forces of Russia. It previously operated within the structures of the Soviet and Russian Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD). Originating as the special forces unit of the Soviet Militsiya in 1988, it has played major roles in several armed conflicts during and following the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union.

OMON is much larger and better known than SOBR, another special-police branch of the National Guard of Russia. In modern contexts, OMON serves as a riot police group, or as a gendarmerie-like paramilitary force. OMON units also exist in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and other post-Soviet states. However, some post-Soviet units have changed names and acronyms. Russian-speakers commonly refer to OMON officers as omonovtsy (; singular: omonovyets – ).

On 5 April 2016 OMON became part of the newly-established National Guard of Russia, ending its years as part of the MVD.
The MVD continues to operate the Police of Russia.

==History==
Special purpose militia units were formed on May 5, 1919 in the Russian state in the structure of the &quot;white&quot; (Siberian) militia. Alexander Kolchak emphasized that

These militia units operated where open war gave way to partisan war. The detachment consisted of four foot and one horse platoons. The staff included 285 people. In those days, there was no such thing as a &quot;omonovets&quot; therefore these units were called &quot;guards&quot;.

Soviet OMON originated in 1979, when the first Soviet police tactical unit was founded in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow to ensure that there were no terrorist incidents like the Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics. Subsequently, the unit was to be utilized in emergencies such as high-risk arrests, hostage crises and acts of terror.
The current OMON system is the successor of that group and was founded on 3 October 1988 in Moscow and was called the Militsiya Squad of Special Assignment. Special police detachments were often manned by former soldiers of the Soviet Army and veterans of the Soviet–Afghan War. OMON units were used as riot police to control and stop demonstrations and hooliganism, as well as to respond to emergency situations involving violent crime. The units later took on a wider range of police duties, including cordon and street patrol actions, and even paramilitary and military-style operations.

Following Russia&#x27;s 2011 police reform, Russian OMON units were to be renamed Distinctive Purpose Teams (KON), while OMSN (SOBR) would become Special Purpose Teams (KSN). It was announced that Special Purpose Centers for Rapid Deployment forces would also be created in Russian regions, to include regional OMON and OMSN units. In essence, all police spetsnaz (special designation) units were brought together under the joint command of the Interior Ministry — the Center for Operational Spetsnaz and Aviation Forces of MVD (Центр специального назначения сил оперативного реагирования и авиации МВД России).

In January 2012, Russia&#x27;s OMON was renamed from &quot;otryad militsii osobogo naznacheniya&quot;, (Special Purpose Militia Unit) to &quot;otryad mobilniy osobogo naznacheniya&quot; (Special Purpose Mobile Unit), keeping the acronym.
===Soviet OMON activities===

*On 20 January 1991, Soviet-loyalist Riga OMON attacked Latvia&#x27;s Interior Ministry, killing six people during the January 1991 events which was not confirmed by an internal investigation, in a failed pro-Moscow coup attempt following the Latvian SSR&#x27;s declaration of independence. Seven OMON officers were subsequently found guilty by the Riga District Court and were sentenced in absentia. Part of the Riga OMON troops remained loyal to the USSR and their oath of allegiance. The unit was evacuated from Riga to Tyumen in Russia by air force together with all ammunition, vehicles and firearms, and incorporated with local Tyumen OMON.
*A series of attacks on border outposts of the newly independent Republic of Lithuania took place during the period of January to July 1991. These resulted in several summary execution-style deaths of unarmed customs officers and other people (including former members of Vilnius OMON), which were attributed to Riga OMON. Some sources say that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had lost control of the unit during that period. For years, Lithuania has continued to demand that the persons suspected in these incidents should be tried in Lithuania; one suspect was arrested in Latvia in November 2008.
*The April–May 1991 Operation Ring by the Azerbaijan SSR OMON and the Soviet Army against the Armenian irregular units in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, resulted in forty deaths of mostly Armenian civilians, and the forced displacement of nearly 10,000 ethnic Armenians. In later attacks, several more Armenian civilians were killed; others suffered abuse which included instances of rape. In continuing fighting in this area, fourteen Azerbaijani OMON members and one Armenian paramilitary fighter were reported killed in September 1991.
*Violent and often armed clashes occurred between the Georgian SSR&#x27;s OMON and opponents of the first Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia prior to the Georgian Civil War of 1991–1993. Eleven combatants on both sides, including Georgian OMON members and regular militsiya officers, were reported killed in skirmishes during September and October 1991. There were also allegations of OMON firing at unarmed protesters.

===Post-Soviet OMON activities===
* Prior to the creation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the bulk of the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, on the Azeri side, was conducted by the post-Soviet OMON units and irregular forces. This included the defence of the village of Khojaly by a group of Azeri OMON troops and armed volunteers against the Armenian and Russian Army forces prior to, and during, the Khojaly massacre on 25 February 1992; most of the group involved died along with several hundred other Azeris, mostly civilians.
* South Ossetian ad hoc OMON, organized by a group of Tskhinvali internal affairs division militsiya officers, was reportedly the most combat-ready force on the separatist side at the outset of the South Ossetia War in April 1992.
* In Tajikistan, the civil war began after local OMON began defecting to anti-Nabiyev protesters in May 1992. The country&#x27;s minority Pamiri people largely backed the United Tajik Opposition, and for that reason were targeted for massacres by pro-government forces during the bloody first phase of the war in 1992–1993. A significant portion of the Tajikistan MVD&#x27;s command structure and its OMON consisted mainly of Pamiris who were then either killed or forced to flee to Gorno-Badakhshan.
* North Ossetia&#x27;s OMON participated in the short but vicious 1992 East Prigorodny Conflict in Russia. They killed or &#x27;disappeared&#x27; hundreds of local indigenous Ingush people. Ossetian OMON reportedly massacred residents of Ingush villages that had first been shelled by Russian federal army tanks that were officially in to the region for &#x27;peacekeeping&#x27; purposes.
* Following the War of Transnistria in 1992, several high-ranking former OMON and KGB officers assumed senior posts in Moldova&#x27;s pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria. Former Riga OMON Major Vladimir Antyufeyev, who had led the attacks against Latvian authorities in 1991 and was put on the Interpol wanted list, renamed himself &quot;General Vadim Shevtsov&quot; and became Transnistria&#x27;s minister of state security and intelligence. He is also alleged to have overseen the self-declared republic&#x27;s organized criminal smuggling rackets. In 2012, the KGB of Transnistria announced it has &quot;launched a criminal investigation into Vladimir Antyufeev who is suspected of misuse of state powers.&quot;
* Moscow OMON, and units brought from other cities, clashed with anti-Yeltsin demonstrators during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis and reportedly beat some members of the Supreme Soviet of Russia (Russian parliament at the time).

* OMON have broken up several opposition rallies, including the Dissenters&#x27; Marches since 2006, sparking reports of police brutality, including excessive use of force and arbitrary detention of participants. In 2007, the brutal actions of OMON against peaceful protesters and arrests of opposition figures were harshly criticised by the European Union institutions and governments. Moscow OMON also made international news when it prevented gay rights activists (including the European Parliament members) from marching after the Mayor of Moscow Yury Luzhkov did not allow a planned parade to take place in 2007.
* On 24 March 2006, Belarusian OMON stormed the opposition&#x27;s tent camp at Minsk&#x27;s October Square without provocation, violently ending the peaceful Jeans Revolution against the regime of Alexander Lukashenko. Thousands of people were beaten and hundreds detained, including the opposition&#x27;s presidential candidate Alaksandr Kazulin, as a result of the attack.
* In February 2008, Tajik OMON commander Oleg Zakharchenko was killed in a shootout with an anti-organized crime police unit composed of former opposition fighters, under disputed circumstances, in Gharm. In 2009, the former Interior Minister of Tajikistan, Mahmadnazar Salihov, allegedly committed suicide to avoid being arrested in connection with the case; Salihov&#x27;s family claimed he was murdered in a political purge.
* South Ossetian separatist OMON took part in the fighting against the Georgian Armed Forces in August, during the 2008 South Ossetia war and were accused of &quot;special cruelty&quot; against civilians in the overrun ethnic Georgian villages. Subsequently, South Ossetian OMON fighters were absorbed into Russian regular forces in the area as contract soldiers and continued to be deployed in the highly disputed Akhalgori zone.
* Gulmurod Khalimov, the Russian-U.S. trained OMON chief in Tajikistan since 2012, disappeared in 2015. He had defected to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria, and threatened to attack American cities. He was declared wanted for treason by Tajik government.

===Conflict in Chechnya===
The force was active in the First Chechen War of 1994–1996 in which OMON was often used in various security and light infantry roles, notably for the notorious &quot;cleansing&quot; (&quot;zachistka&quot;) operations. Prior to the war, there was also an OMON formation belonging to the Interior Ministry (MVD) of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Chechnya&#x27;s separatist government. The independent Chechnya had an OMON battalion prior to the war, but it was not battle trained, and did not play any significant role as an organized force before disintegrating. During the armed conflict, almost every Russian city would be regularly sending &quot;militsiya&quot; groups, often OMON members, for tours of usually three or four months. The pro-Moscow administration of the Chechen Republic also formed its own OMON detachments. In February 1996, a group of thirty-seven Russian OMON officers from Novosibirsk surrendered to Chechen militants of Salman Raduyev and Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov during the Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye hostage crisis.

OMON took part in the Second Chechen War as well. OMON forces sustained severe losses in the conflict, including from the March 2000 ambush which killed scores of servicemen from Berezniki and Perm (including nine captured and executed), the July 2000 suicide bombing which killed at least twenty-five Russians at Argun base of OMON from Chelyabinsk, and the April 2002 mine attack which left twenty-one Chechen OMON troops dead in central Grozny. Control and discipline continued to be questionable in Chechnya, where OMON members were known to have engaged in, or fallen victim to, several deadly incidents of friendly fire and fratricide. In perhaps the bloodiest of such incidents, at least twenty-four were killed when OMON from Podolsk attacked a column of OMON from Sergiyev Posad in Grozny on 2 March 2000. Among other incidents, several Chechen OMON servicemen were abducted and executed in Grozny by Russian military servicemen in November 2000, members of Chechen OMON engaged in a shootout with the Ingush police on the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia resulting in eight fatalities in September 2006, and Ramzan Kadyrov-controlled local OMON clashed with a group of rival Chechens belonging to the Kakiyev&#x27;s Spetsnaz GRU military unit in Grozny, resulting in at least five being killed in 2007.

OMON was often accused of severe human rights abuses during the course of the conflict, including abducting, torturing, raping and killing civilians. By 2000, the bulk of such crimes, as recorded by international organisations in Chechnya, appeared to have been committed either by or with the participation of OMON. Moscow region OMON took part in the April 1995 rampage in the village of Samashki, where up to 300 civilians were reportedly killed during a large-scale brutal &quot;cleansing&quot; operation by federal MVD forces. In December 1999, a group of unidentified OMON members manning a roadblock checkpoint shot dead around forty refugees fleeing the siege of Grozny. OMON from Saint Petersburg are believed to have been behind the February 2000 Novye Aldi massacre in which at least sixty civilians were robbed and then killed by Russian forces entering Grozny after the fall of the city; one officer, Sergei Babin, was to be prosecuted in relation to the case in 2005 but he vanished. In April 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found Russia guilty of the forced disappearance of Shakhid Baysayev, a Chechen man who had gone missing after being detained in a March 2000 security sweep by Russian OMON in Grozny. In 2007, Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug OMON officer Sergei Lapin was sentenced for the kidnapping and torture of a Chechen man in Grozny in 2001, with the Grozny court criticising the conduct of OMON serving in Chechnya in broader terms. In an event related to the conflict in Chechnya, several OMON officers were also accused of starting the May 2007 wave of ethnic violence in Stavropol by assisting in the racially motivated murder of a local Chechen man.
===Persecution of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
In 2021 OMON officers tortured Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Irkutsk in an attempt to make them inform about other members.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===

Some OMON units participated in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine where they were intended to disperse riots and control civil unrest after Kyiv would be captured. The failure to capture Kyiv resulted in some SOBR missions becoming redundant, they also ended up engaging in military combat and some of its personnel being killed in action or captured by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

A group of OMON officers are suing for unlawful dismissal after being sacked for refusing to fight in Ukraine. On 28 September 2022, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and National Police of Ukraine published CCTV footage showing OMON and Rosgvardiya personnel shooting at civilians during the battle of Hostomel.

==Russia==
In Russia, there is an OMON unit in every oblast, as well as in many major cities. Since 2016, the OMON units report directly to the National Guard Forces Command as part of its regional district commands, and they are expected to be deployed in support of the police forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Information from different sources suggested that there were between 10,500 and 15,000 OMON members stationed at population centers and transportation hubs around the country during the 1990s. The number officially rose to about 20,000 nationwide by 2007; the biggest OMON unit in Russia, Moscow OMON, numbers over 2,000 members. Most OMON officers retire at the age of approximately forty-five. They were also sometimes not paid for their service. In 2001, for example, some fifty OMON members from Moscow filed a lawsuit claiming they had not been paid for one month of combat operations in Chechnya. The use of OMON members in high-risk situations, especially in Chechnya and elsewhere in the North Caucasus, often causes the group to lose members in combat.

===Moscow Zubr===

The Zubr Special Purpose Police Detachment (; is Russian for Bison, particularly the European bison) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia was created in February 2006 on the basis of the OMON GUVD in the Moscow Region that existed since 1988. It is based in Shchelkovo-7 near Moscow. Zubr was made up of officers drawn from the OMON riot police near Moscow and numbered about 430 people. Zubr is equipped with armored personnel carriers, Tigrs and other special equipment, and includes snipers and dog handlers.

===Equipment===
OMON groups use a wide range of firearms, including AK-74 assault rifle, AKS-74U carbine assault rifle, 9A-91 compact assault rifle, and PP-19 Bizon submachine gun, and the Makarov pistol, Stechkin automatic pistol and the MP-443 Grach or GSh-18 are assigned as sidearms. OMON units may use other weaponry, typically used by Russian light infantry during special operations and in war zones, such as: the PK machine gun, the GP-25 underbarrel grenade launcher for assault rifle or the GM-94 pump-action grenade launcher, RPG series rocket-proppelled grenade launchers, and the Dragunov and Vintorez designated marksman rifles. The kind of issued protective gear is shared with regular National Guard units. The Bagariy body armor is a common sight replacing the older Kora-Kulon while the ZSH 1–2 is the main issued helmet with the older Kolpak being used only on riot duty. They are sometimes called &quot;OMON soldiers&quot;.
As riot police, OMON often uses special equipment termed riot gear to help protect themselves and attack others. Riot gear typically includes personal armor, batons, riot and tactical shields, and riot helmets. OMON also deploys specialized less-than-lethal weapons, such as water cannon, pepper spray, tear gas, sponge grenades, pistols, rifles, and shotguns which fire rubber bullets, bean bag rounds, stun grenades, and Long Range Acoustic Devices.

===Transport===
OMON vehicles include specially-equipped vans, buses and trucks of various types (often armored and sometimes equipped with mounted machine guns), as well as a limited number of armored personnel carriers such as GAZ Tigr, BTR-60, BTR-70 and BTR-80.

===Uniforms===
OMON&#x27;s headgear remains their signature black beret (they are thus sometimes called &quot;Black Berets&quot;), which they share with the Naval Infantry.

OMON, as part of the RosGvard, is transitioning to the Russian version of the ATACS LE (blue/grey) but units are still seen wearing the traditional Noch-91 uniform in all-black, and blue or gray Tigerstripe camouflage, a not uncommon sight has been a variety of Russian Army and Russian Internal Troops uniforms, often with (black) balaclava masks and/or helmets.

<text>Memorial Gymnasium is a multi-purpose facility located in Nashville, Tennessee. Usually called Memorial Gym or simply Memorial, the building is located on the western side of the Vanderbilt University campus. It was built in 1952 and currently has a seating capacity of 14,326. It serves as home court for the school&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball programs, and will also serve as the home of Vanderbilt&#x27;s upcoming women&#x27;s volleyball program, scheduled to begin play in 2025.

==Construction and unusual design==
Memorial Gymnasium was built in the early 1950s, designed by Edwin A. Keeble. It was dedicated as the campus memorial to students and alumni killed in World War II; a plaque commemorating these people is displayed in the lobby. At the time of its construction, there was a serious discussion within the Vanderbilt community about whether the school should de-emphasize intercollegiate athletics. As a compromise, the gymnasium was built to hold only about 8,000 seats, and it would be readily adaptable to other uses.

The gymnasium floor was built up above its surroundings, more in the nature of a stage. The areas out of bounds along the sidelines were very wide, in contrast with the small facility which it replaced, where the walls were right along the sidelines and players could scrape their shoulders bringing the ball up the court. This necessitated the placement of the benches at each end of the court, which was not highly unusual at the time. In addition, each goal was originally anchored by two far-reaching beams attached to support columns, with extra support coming from cables stretching all the way to the gym&#x27;s ceiling. (In the case of a backboard shatter or beam fracture, replacing the old goals would be highly difficult, compared to the usual goal setup at most venues.) The main gym, unlike the practice gyms, does not have air conditioning. Until a 2017 renovation, the shot clocks were positioned below the backboard on the player&#x27;s right. A new conventional Spalding backstop, with a Daktronics shot clock above the center of the goal, was installed for the 2017–18 season.

Memorial Gym is well known for its unusual design. The end-of-the-floor bench location is now unique in major college basketball, and said to give Vanderbilt a home court advantage, since no other facility in which opponents play is arranged in such a way. The interior walls were unpainted cinder blocks prior to a major renovation in the early 2000s. The middle of the three decks has a low ceiling; when the house lights are turned off during game play gives the distinct impression of watching a Cinemascope movie of basketball.

For many years opposing coaches complained they had to coach their team from the baseline, making it very tough to communicate from the other end of the floor. This was due to the placement of the team benches on the baselines. However, beginning in the 2015–16 season, coaches were given typical coaching boxes that ran up the sideline, as in every other college gym. Now, even though their teams are still on the baseline, the coaches have the ability to roam the sideline up to the end of a regulation NCAA coaching box.

==History==
As Southeastern Conference basketball grew in popularity and Vanderbilt established itself as a basketball power, the seating capacity proved inadequate. The gymnasium had been designed in a way which made it readily expandable, and by the mid-1960s it seated 11,103. A conference championship run in 1966 led to even more demand for seats, and by the end of the decade the facility seated 15,581. It usually sold out, especially for conference games, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s Vanderbilt was consistently in the top ten for attendance in all of college basketball, a remarkable achievement for a middle-sized private institution. The arena hosted the SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1984 and 1991.

In the early 1990s the building served as the host site for a &quot;Battle of the Boulevard&quot; rivalry game between Lipscomb and Belmont, two other Nashville institutions with a long history of quality basketball. The game was moved to Memorial when it became apparent that demand for tickets would greatly outstrip their availability at Belmont&#x27;s former home court, tiny Striplin Gymnasium. However, even event organizers themselves were shocked when the doubleheader between the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s teams sold Memorial out by the halftime of the women&#x27;s game. This event still (as of 2019) holds the all-time attendance record for an NAIA basketball game.

In 1967, two events lent this landmark a deeper social-historical significance. On April 7 and 8, 1967, as part of Vanderbilt’s annual student-organized Impact Symposium series, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke at Memorial Gym on “The Future of Integration,” U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond on “Conservative Individualism,” poet Allen Ginsberg on “The Individual in American Society,” and Stokely Carmichael on “The Individual and Black Power.” The other socially momentous event occurred in Fall of 1967 when Vanderbilt&#x27;s Perry Wallace broke the Southeastern Conference (SEC) racial barrier as the first African-American athlete.

==Host for post-season college basketball==

Memorial Gym has hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship on four occasions (1973 regionals, 1982/1989/1993 first- and second-round games). It has also served as home to the 1984 and 1991 SEC Men&#x27;s Basketball tournaments. In the 1984 tournament, Charles Barkley&#x27;s &quot;sitting at midcourt&quot; episode occurred after his Auburn Tigers were beaten in the tournament championship by the Kentucky Wildcats. In 1991, Alabama won the championship 88–69 over Tennessee.

It has served as an NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament host site 12 times (first- and/or second-round games in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2001, 2002, 2006, and 2012, plus regionals in 1998).

Then-Florida State coach Pat Kennedy complained about the arrangement after his team lost a first-round NCAA Tournament game there.

The NCAA has used the newer Bridgestone Arena, a larger arena with a modern configuration in downtown Nashville, for first- and second-round men&#x27;s tournament games on four more recent occasions (2000, 2003, 2005, 2012) instead of Memorial Gym.

==Renovations and recent history==
In recent years the facility has been modernized; the addition of a press box, suites, and other amenities have reduced the seating capacity somewhat. The facility is favored by many basketball purists as an example of a facility designed primarily for that sport—although it also at times housed other facilities for the Vanderbilt athletic operation, such as a swimming pool—and has been called the &quot;Fenway Park of College Basketball.&quot;

Memorial Gym was the site of the Jeff Lacy versus Jermain Taylor WBC super middleweight elimination bout on November 15, 2008, the first time that the gym had hosted a major professional boxing event. The undercard of this fight also saw future WBC Heavyweight World Champion Deontay Wilder make his professional debut.

<text>Hillhead (, ) is an area of Glasgow, Scotland. Situated north of Kelvingrove Park and to the south of the River Kelvin, Hillhead is at the heart of Glasgow&#x27;s fashionable West End, with Byres Road forming the western border of the area, the other boundaries being Dumbarton Road to the south and the River Kelvin to the east and north.

==History==
Hillhead was an independent police burgh from 1869, but as Glasgow grew during the nineteenth century it was first swallowed up physically by the growing city, and then administratively in 1891.

==Landmarks==
The University of Glasgow is located in the area, having moved from its original site on the High Street to its current Gilmorehill location in 1870. Consequently a great number of students live in the area. Many academics from the University live in the area along with BBC Scotland employees, actors, broadcasters, writers and many students from various universities and teaching hospitals, creating an economically and culturally diverse community.

Other features of Hillhead include Ashton Lane, Western Baths, Hillhead High School, Glasgow Academy (a private school), and the Kelvinbridge, which straddles the River Kelvin which used to form an eastern boundary between Hillhead and Glasgow, until Hillhead&#x27;s incorporation into the city.

==Transport==
The area is served by Hillhead subway station and Kelvinbridge subway station on the Glasgow Subway system. The two stops on either side of those are Kelvinhall in Partick, and St George&#x27;s Cross in Woodlands.

==Churches==
The neoclassical colonnaded Wellington Church is located on University Avenue, directly opposite the University. The church is a Category A listed building.

==Archives==
The archives about Hillhead are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow (GUAS).
