<text>Arthur Henry Adams (6 June 1872 – 4 March 1936) was a journalist and author. He started his career in New Zealand, though he spent most of it in Australia, and for a short time lived in China and London.

==Biography==

Arthur Adams was born in Lawrence, New Zealand, and educated at the University of Otago, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and began studying law. He then abandoned law to become a journalist in Wellington, where he began contributing poetry to &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, a Sydney periodical. He moved to Sydney in 1898, and took up a position as private secretary and literary advisor to J.C. Williamson, a noted theatrical manager.

In 1900 Adams travelled to China to cover the Boxer Rebellion as a journalist for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and several New Zealand papers. He would later return to New Zealand before moving to London in 1902, where he published several works including &quot;The Nazarene&quot; (1902) and &quot;London Streets&quot;, a collection of poems (1906). Adams returned to Australia in 1906, he took over from A. G. Stephens as editor of the &quot;Bulletin&#x27;s&quot; Red Page until 1909.

In addition to his poetry, Adams wrote both plays and novels. His most successful play was &quot;Mrs. Pretty and the Premier&quot;, which was produced in 1914 by the Melbourne Repertory Theatre.

Adams died on 4 March 1936 in Sydney. He had married Lily Paton in 1908. She and two daughters and a son survived him.

<text>Jesse Benjamin Stoner Jr. (April 13, 1924 – April 23, 2005) was an American lawyer, white supremacist, neo-Nazi, segregationist politician, and domestic terrorist who perpetrated the 1958 bombing of the Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. He was not convicted for the bombing of the church until 1980.

He was a founder and the long-time chairman of the National States&#x27; Rights Party; he published its newsletter, &quot;The Thunderbolt&quot;. Stoner campaigned for several political offices as a Southern Democrat in order to promote his white supremacist agenda.

==Early life==
Jesse Benjamin Stoner Jr was born in LaFayette, Georgia. His family ran a sight-seeing company on Lookout Mountain, as well as in nearby Chattanooga. At age two, he contracted childhood polio, which impaired one of his legs and resulted in a lifelong limp. His father Jesse Benjamin Stoner Sr., died when he was five; his mother Minnie died when he was 17.

==Career==
Stoner admired segregationist politician Theodore G. Bilbo. He became active in white supremacist groups and traveled to Washington, D.C. to support Bilbo. 

Stoner rechartered a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in Chattanooga in 1942, when he was 18 years old. Stoner once said that &quot;being a Jew [should] be a crime punishable by death.&quot; He ran the National States&#x27; Rights Party, founded by Edward Reed Fields, an associate of Stoner&#x27;s.

Stoner received a law degree from Atlanta Law School in 1952. He served as the attorney for James Earl Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King Jr. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) suspected that Stoner was also involved in the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., as well as bombings of several synagogues and black churches during the 1950s and 1960s, such as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama.

He lived at 591 Cherokee Street in &quot;Old&quot; Marietta, Georgia.

As a &quot;roving white supremacist&quot;, Stoner, along with Connie Lynch, was present in Bogalusa, Louisiana in 1965. He performed the same road show to inflame white mobs as he had done in St. Augustine, Florida during the summer of 1964.

Stoner ran for governor of Georgia in 1970. During the campaign, in which he called himself the &quot;candidate of love&quot;, he described Adolf Hitler as &quot;too moderate&quot;; described black people as an extension of the ape family; and said that Jews are &quot;vipers of Hell.&quot; The primary was won by Jimmy Carter, a civil rights movement supporter, and future president. 

Stoner ran for the United States Senate in 1972, finishing fifth in the Democratic Party primary with just over 40,000 votes. The nomination and the election were both won by Sam Nunn.

During Stoner&#x27;s Senate campaign, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that television stations had to play his offensive, racist ads because of the fairness doctrine. 

Stoner continued his losing campaigns, running for lieutenant governor in 1974, and again for a seat in the US Senate in 1980. His best showing was 73,000 votes (10%) in his campaign for lieutenant governor in 1974, when he sought to succeed Lester G. Maddox in Georgia&#x27;s second- highest constitutional office. That year, Maddox lost the gubernatorial nomination to former legislator George D. Busbee.

In 1978, Stoner ran in the Democratic gubernatorial primary and polled 37,654 votes (5.4%).

==Bethel Baptist Church bombing==

Stoner was a suspect in the 1958 bombing of the Bethel Baptist Church, but he was not indicted for it until 1977. In 1980, a mostly white jury found him guilty and sentenced him to ten years in prison. 

Prosecutors suspected that Stoner perpetrated as many as a dozen other bombings attributed to the &quot;Confederate Underground&quot;; these included the attempted bombing of Temple Beth-El in Charlotte, North Carolina (1957); and the bombings or attempted bombing of Temple Emanuel in Gastonia, North Carolina (1958), the Nashville, Tennessee Jewish Community Center (1958), Temple Beth El in Miami, Florida (1958), the Jacksonville Jewish Center and a black elementary school (1958), Temple Beth-El in Birmingham, Alabama (1958), and The Temple in Atlanta (1958), and Congregation Anshai Emeth in Peoria, Illinois (1958). He was not prosecuted for any of those cases.

After being convicted for the Birmingham bombing, Stoner appealed his conviction for three years. When his appeals ran out, he lived in hiding as a fugitive for four months. In 1984, he was permanently removed from the roster of lawyers who may appear before the United States Supreme Court. 

Stoner was released from prison for good behavior in 1986, having served years of his 10-year sentence. In 1990, Stoner ran for lieutenant governor again.

==Later life==
After his release from prison and until his death at the age of 81, Stoner lived at a nursing home in northwest Georgia, still defending his segregationist views. In one of his last interviews he stated, &quot;A person isn&#x27;t supposed to apologize for being right.&quot; His left side was partially paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Stoner is buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

<doc id="958752" wikidata="Q424178" url="?curid=958752" title="Lipid raft">
<text>The plasma membranes of cells contain combinations of glycosphingolipids, cholesterol and protein receptors organized in glycolipoprotein lipid microdomains termed lipid rafts. Their existence in cellular membranes remains controversial. Indeed, Kervin and Overduin imply that lipid rafts are misconstrued protein islands, which they propose form through a proteolipid code. Nonetheless, it has been proposed that they are specialized membrane microdomains which compartmentalize cellular processes by serving as organising centers for the assembly of signaling molecules, allowing a closer interaction of protein receptors and their effectors to promote kinetically favorable interactions necessary for the signal transduction. Lipid rafts influence membrane fluidity and membrane protein trafficking, thereby regulating neurotransmission and receptor trafficking. Lipid rafts are more ordered and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer, but float freely within the membrane bilayer. Although more common in the cell membrane, lipid rafts have also been reported in other parts of the cell, such as the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes.

== Properties ==

One key difference between lipid rafts and the plasma membranes from which they are derived is lipid composition. Research has shown that lipid rafts contain 3 to 5-fold the amount of cholesterol found in the surrounding bilayer. Also, lipid rafts are enriched in sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin, which is typically elevated by 50% compared to the plasma membrane. To offset the elevated sphingolipid levels, phosphatidylcholine levels are decreased which results in similar choline-containing lipid levels between the rafts and the surrounding plasma membrane. Cholesterol interacts preferentially, although not exclusively, with sphingolipids due to their structure and the saturation of the hydrocarbon chains. Although not all of the phospholipids within the raft are fully saturated, the hydrophobic chains of the lipids contained in the rafts are more saturated and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer. Cholesterol is the dynamic &quot;glue&quot; that holds the raft together. Due to the rigid nature of the sterol group, cholesterol partitions preferentially into the lipid rafts where acyl chains of the lipids tend to be more rigid and in a less fluid state. One important property of membrane lipids is their amphipathic character. Amphipathic lipids have a polar, hydrophilic head group and a non-polar, hydrophobic region. The figure to the right shows the inverted cone-like shape of sphingomyelin and the cone-like shape of cholesterol based on the area of space occupied by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Cholesterol can pack in between the lipids in rafts, serving as a molecular spacer and filling any voids between associated sphingolipids.

Rietveld &amp; Simons related lipid rafts in model membranes to the immiscibility of ordered (Lo phase) and disordered (Ld or Lα phase) liquid phases. The cause of this immiscibility is uncertain, but the immiscibility is thought to minimize the free energy between the two phases. Studies have shown there is a difference in thickness of the lipid rafts and the surrounding membrane which results in hydrophobic mismatch at the boundary between the two phases. This phase height mismatch has been shown to increase line tension which may lead to the formation of larger and more circular raft platforms to minimize the energetic cost of maintaining the rafts as a separate phase. Other spontaneous events, such as curvature of the membrane and fusing of small rafts into larger rafts, can also minimize line tension.

By one early definition of lipid rafts, lipid rafts differ from the rest of the plasma membrane. In fact, researchers have hypothesized that the lipid rafts can be extracted from a plasma membrane. The extraction would take advantage of lipid raft resistance to non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-100 or Brij-98 at low temperatures (e.g., 4 °C). When such a detergent is added to cells, the fluid membrane will dissolve while the lipid rafts may remain intact and could be extracted.

Because of their composition and detergent resistance, lipid rafts are also called detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membrane (GEM) complexes or DIGs or Detergent Resistant Membranes (DRMs). However the validity of the detergent resistance methodology of membranes has recently been called into question due to ambiguities in the lipids and proteins recovered and the observation that they can also cause solid areas to form where there were none previously.

== Function ==
Mediation of substrate presentation. Lipid rafts localize palmitoylated proteins away from the disordered region of the plasma membrane. Disruption of palmitate mediated localization then allows for exposure of a protein to its binding partner or substrate in the disordered region, an activation mechanism termed substrate presentation. For example, a protein is often palmitoylated and binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2). PIP2 is polyunsaturated and does not reside in lipid rafts. When the levels of PIP2 increase in the plasma membrane, the protein trafficks to PIP2 clusters where it can be activated directly by PIP2 (or another molecule that associates with PIP2).

It is probable that other functions exist.

== History ==

Until 1982, it was widely accepted that phospholipids and membrane proteins were randomly distributed in cell membranes, according to the Singer-Nicolson fluid mosaic model, published in 1972. However, membrane microdomains were postulated in the 1970s using biophysical approaches by Stier &amp; Sackmann and Klausner &amp; Karnovsky. These microdomains were attributed to the physical properties and organization of lipid mixtures by Stier &amp; Sackmann and Israelachvili et al.

In 1974, the effects of temperature on membrane behavior had led to the proposal of &quot;clusters of lipids&quot; in membranes and by 1975, data suggested that these clusters could be &quot;quasicrystalline&quot; regions within the more freely dispersed liquid crystalline lipid molecule. In 1978, X-Ray diffraction studies led to further development of the &quot;cluster&quot; idea defining the microdomains as &quot;lipids in a more ordered state&quot;.

Karnovsky and co-workers formalized the concept of lipid domains in membranes in 1982. Karnovsky&#x27;s studies showed heterogeneity in the lifetime decay of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, which indicated that there were multiple phases in the lipid environment of the membrane. One type of microdomain is constituted by cholesterol and sphingolipids. They form because of the segregation of these lipids into a separate phase, demonstrated by Biltonen and Thompson and their coworkers. These microdomains (‘rafts’) were shown to exist also in cell membranes. Later, Kai Simons at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Germany and Gerrit van Meer from the University of Utrecht, Netherlands refocused interest on these membrane microdomains, enriched with lipids and cholesterol, glycolipids, and sphingolipids, present in cell membranes. Subsequently, they called these microdomains, lipid &quot;rafts&quot;. The original concept of rafts was used as an explanation for the transport of cholesterol from the trans Golgi network to the plasma membrane. The idea was more formally developed in 1997 by Simons and Ikonen.

At the 2006 Keystone Symposium of Lipid Rafts and Cell Function, lipid rafts were defined as &quot;small (10-200nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein interactions&quot; In recent years, lipid raft studies have tried to address many of the key issues that cause controversy in this field, including the size and lifetime of rafts.

Other questions yet to be answered include: 
*What are the effects of membrane protein levels?
*What is the physiological function of lipid rafts?
*What effect does flux of membrane lipids have on raft formation?
*What effect do diet and drugs have on lipid rafts?
*What effect do proteins located at raft boundaries have on lipid rafts?

==Common types==
Two types of lipid rafts have been proposed: planar lipid rafts (also referred to as non-caveolar, or glycolipid, rafts) and caveolae. Planar rafts are defined as being continuous with the plane of the plasma membrane (not invaginated) and by their lack of distinguishing morphological features. Caveolae, on the other hand, are flask shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that contain caveolin proteins and are the most readily-observed structures in lipid rafts. Caveolins are widely expressed in the brain, micro-vessels of the nervous system, endothelial cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia and hippocampal neurons. Planar rafts contain flotillin proteins and are found in neurons where caveolae are absent. Both types have similar lipid composition (enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids). Flotillin and caveolins can recruit signaling molecules into lipid rafts, thus playing an important role in neurotransmitter signal transduction. It has been proposed that these microdomains spatially organize signaling molecules to promote kinetically favorable interactions which are necessary for signal transduction. Conversely, these microdomains can also separate signaling molecules, inhibiting interactions and dampening signaling responses.

== Role in signal transduction ==
The specificity and fidelity of signal transduction are essential for cells to respond efficiently to changes in their environment. This is achieved in part by the differential localization of proteins that participate in signalling pathways. In the plasma membrane, one approach of compartmentalization utilizes lipid rafts.

One reasonable way to consider lipid rafts is that small rafts can form concentrating platforms after ligand binding activation for individual receptors. Lipid rafts have been found by researchers to be involved in many signal transduction processes, such as Immunoglobulin E signalling, T cell antigen receptor signalling, B cell antigen receptor signalling, EGF receptor signalling, insulin receptor signalling and so on. In order to illustrate these principles, detailed examples of signalling pathways that involve lipid rafts are described below.

=== Epidermal growth factor signaling ===
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds to EGF receptor, also known as HER-1 or ErbB1, to initiate transmembrane signaling. Lipid rafts have been suggested to play a bipartite role in this process. Certain aspects of lipid rafts inhibit EGF receptor function:
* the ganglioside component of lipid rafts was shown to inhibit receptor activation
* the membrane dipole potential, which was shown to be higher in lipid rafts than in the rest of the membrane, was demonstrated to inhibit EGF binding to its receptor
* EGF binding was shown to be inhibited by non-caveolar lipid rafts due to a decrease in the number of receptors available for ligand binding
* EGF and ErbB2 (HER-2) were shown to migrate out of lipid rafts or caveolae during or after activation
* disruption of lipid rafts was shown to induce ligand-independent activation of EGF receptor
At the same time lipid rafts seem to be necessary for or potentiate transmembrane signaling:
* sequestration of ErbB2 from lipid rafts have been shown to inhibit EGF-induced signaling
* the membrane dipole potential, which is higher in lipid rafts than in the rest of the membrane, potentiates EGF-induced signaling
* EGF was shown to bring about coalescence of individual lipid rafts, similar to what has been suggested to play a role in the activation of the T-cell receptor
* localization of EGF receptor to lipid rafts induces resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors

=== Immunoglobulin E signaling ===
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) signaling is the first convincingly demonstrated signaling process which involves lipid rafts. Evidence for this fact includes decreased solubility of Fc-epsilon receptors (FcεR) in Triton X-100 from steady state to crosslinking state, formation of patches large enough to be visualized by fluorescence microscopy from gangliosides and GPI-anchored proteins, abolition of IgE signaling by surface cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and so on.

This signaling pathway can be described as follows: IgE first binds to Fc-epsilon receptors (FcεR) residing in the plasma membrane of mast cells and basophils through its Fc segment. FcεR is a tetramer consist of one α, one β and two γ chains. It is monomeric and binds one IgE molecule. The α chain binds IgE and the other three chains contain immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM). Then oligomeric antigens bind to receptor-bound IgE to crosslink two or more of these receptors. This crosslinking then recruits doubly acylated non-receptor Src-like tyrosine kinase Lyn to phosphorylate ITAMs. After that, Syk family tyrosine kinases bind these phosphotyrosine residues of ITAMs to initiate the signaling cascade. Syk can, in turn, activate other proteins such as LAT. Through crosslinking, LAT can recruit other proteins into the raft and further amplify the signal.

=== T-cell antigen receptor signaling ===
T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a molecule found on the surface of T lymphocytes (T cells). It is composed of αβ-heterodimers, CD3 (γδε) complex and ξ-homodimer. The α- and β- subunits contain extracellular binding sites for peptides that are presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II proteins on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). The CD3 and ξ- subunits contain cytoplasmic ITAM motifs. 
During the signaling process, MHCs binding to TCRs brings two or more receptors together. This crosslinking, similar to IgE signaling, then recruits doubly acylated non-receptor Src-like tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate ITAM tyrosine residues. In addition to recruiting Lyn, TCR signaling also recruits Fyn.

Following this procedure, ZAP-70 (which is also different with IgE signalling) binds to phosphorylated ITAMs, which leads to its own activation and LAT activation. LAT activation is the source of signal amplification. Another difference between IgE and T cell antigen receptor signalling is that Lck activation by TCR could result in more severe raft clustering thus more signal amplification. One possible mechanism of down-regulating this signaling involves the binding of cytosolic kinase Csk to the raft associated protein CBP. Csk may then suppress the Src-family kinases through phosphorylation.

=== B-cell antigen receptor signaling ===
B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a complex between a membrane bound Ig (mIg) molecule and a disulfide-linked Igα- Igβ heterodimer of two polypeptides. Igα and Igβ each contains an amino acid motif, called ITAM, whose sequence is D/ExxYxxL/Ix7YxxL/I.

The process of B cell antigen receptor signalling is similar to Immunoglobulin E signalling and T-cell antigen receptor signalling. It is commonly believed that other than BCR, lipid rafts play an important role in many of the cell surface events involved in B cell activation. Their functions include signaling by BCR, modulation of that signaling by co-receptors, signaling by CD40, endocytosis of antigen bound to the BCR and its routing to late endosomes to facilitate loading of antigen-derived peptides onto class II MHC molecules, routing of those peptide/MHC-II complexes to the cell surface, and their participation in antigen presentation to T cells.

== As platforms for virus entry ==
Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, have to involve specific interaction of virus and cellular receptor expressed at the plasma membrane in order to enter cells. Accumulated evidence supports that viruses enter cells via penetration of specific membrane microdomains, including lipid rafts.

=== Nonenveloped virus ===
The best studied models of lipid rafts-related nonenveloped viral entry are simian virus 40 (SV40, Papovaviridae) and echovirus type 1 (EV1, Picornaviridae).

SV40 utilizes two different receptors to bind onto cell surface: ganglioside GM1 located in lipid rafts and major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecule. Binding of SV40 with MHC class I molecules triggers receptor clustering and redistribution. SV40 may recruit more caveolae from the cytoplasm or even new caveolae formed at the site of entry. A cascade of virus-induced signaling events triggered by attachment results in caveolae-mediated endocytosis in about 20 min. In some cell types the virus can enter the caveosomes directly from lipid rafts in non-coated vesicles.

EV1 uses α2β1-integrin as cellular receptor. Multiple integrin heterodimers can bind to the adjacent sites of the virus capsid. Similar to SV40, attachment and binding with cells triggers clustering and relocation of integrin molecules from lipid rafts to the caveolae-like structures. Depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts inhibits EV1 infection.

There are also viruses that use the non-caveolar raft-mediated endocytosis, such as Echovirus 11 (EV11, picornavirus). However, detailed mechanisms still need to be further characterized.

=== Enveloped virus ===
Influenza viruses bind to the cellular receptor sialic acid, which links to glycoconjugate on the cell surface, to initiate endocytosis. After transportation into late endosomes, low-pH-dependent conformation changes of HA induces fusion, and viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) are released by proton influx of viral ion channel M2 proteins that requires binding with cholesterol. Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SIN) require cholesterol and sphingolipids in target membrane lipid rafts for envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion and entry. Human T-lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-1) enter cells via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1). Ebola virus and Marburg virus use folate receptor-α (FRα), which is a GPI-anchored protein, as a cellular receptor. Hepatitis B virus recognizes human complement receptor type 2 (CR2, or known as CD21). Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) binds to human CD46 on host cell surface. All these viral receptors are located in lipid rafts or would be relocated into lipid rafts after infection.

Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as a sexually-transmitted animal virus, must first penetrate a barrier of epithelial cells, who don&#x27;t express CD4 and chemokine receptors, to establish a productive infection. An alternative receptor for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein on epithelial cells is glycosphingolipid galactosyl-ceramide (GalCer), which enriches at lipid raft.

===SARS-Cov-2===
The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 was shown to enter through endocytosis using lipid rafts. The omicron variant predominantly enters through endocytosis, presumably through lipid rafts. Hydroxychloroquine blocks the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking ACE2 association with enodocytic lipids.

== Visualization ==

One of the primary reasons for the controversy over lipid rafts has stemmed from the challenges of studying lipid rafts in living cells, which are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Lipid rafts are small microdomains ranging from 10 to 200 nm in size. Due to their size being below the classical diffraction limit of a light microscope, lipid rafts have proved difficult to visualize directly. Currently synthetic membranes are studied; however, there are many drawbacks to using these membranes. First, synthetic membranes have a lower concentration of proteins compared to biomembranes. Also, it is difficult to model membrane-cytoskeletal interactions which are present in biomembranes. Other pitfalls include lack of natural asymmetry and inability to study the membranes in non-equilibrium conditions. Despite this, fluorescence microscopy is used extensively in the field. For example, fluorophores conjugated to cholera-toxin B-subunit, which binds to the raft constituent ganglioside GM1 is used extensively. Also used are lipophilic membrane dyes which either partition between rafts and the bulk membrane, or change their fluorescent properties in response to membrane phase. Laurdan is one of the prime examples of such a dye. Rafts may also be labeled by genetic expression of fluorescent fusion proteins such as Lck-GFP.

Manipulation of cholesterol is one of the most widely used techniques for studying lipid rafts. Sequestration (using filipin, nystatin or amphotericin), depletion and removal (using methyl-B-cyclodextrin) and inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are ways cholesterol are manipulated in lipid raft studies. These studies allow for the observations of effects on neurotransmitter signaling upon reduction of cholesterol levels.

Sharma and colleagues used combination of high resolution imaging and mathematical modeling to provide the view that raft proteins are organized into high density nanoclusters with radii ranging over 5–20 nm. Using measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the same probes (homo-FRET or fluorescence anisotropy), Sharma and colleagues reported that a fraction (20–40%) of GPI-anchored proteins are organized into high density clusters of 4–5 nm radius, each consisting of a few molecules and different GPI-anchored proteins.
To combat the problems of small size and dynamic nature, single particle and molecule tracking using cooled, sensitive CCD cameras and total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy is coming to prominence. This allows information of the diffusivity of particles in the membrane to be extracted as well as revealing membrane corrals, barriers and sites of confinement.

Other optical techniques are also used: Fluorescence Correlation and Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) can be used to gain information of fluorophore mobility in the membrane, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) can detect when fluorophores are in close proximity and optical tweezer techniques can give information on membrane viscosity.

Not only optical techniques, but also scanning probe techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) or Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) can be used to detect the topological and mechanical properties of synthetic lipids or native cell membranes isolated by cell unroofing.

Also used are dual polarisation interferometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) although fluorescence microscopy remains the dominant technique. In the future it is hoped that super-resolution microscopy such as Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) or various forms of structured illumination microscopy may overcome the problems imposed by the diffraction limit.

Other techniques used in the analysis of lipid rafts include ELISA, western blotting, and FACS.

== Controversy ==

The role of rafts in cellular signaling, trafficking, and structure has yet to be determined despite many experiments involving several different methods, and their very existence is controversial despite all the above.

Arguments against the existence of lipid rafts include the following:

* First, a line tension should exist between the Lα and Lo phases. This line has been seen in model membranes, but has not been readily observed in cell systems.
* Second, there is no consensus on lipid raft size, which has been reported anywhere between 1 and 1,000 nanometers.
* Third, the time scale of lipid raft existence is unknown. If lipid rafts exist, they may only occur on a time scale that is irrelevant to biological processes.
* Fourth, the entire membrane may exist in the Lo phase.

A first rebuttal to this point suggests that the Lo phase of the rafts is more tightly packed due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding exhibited between sphingolipids and cholesterol that is not seen elsewhere.

A second argument questions the effectiveness of the experimental design when disrupting lipid rafts. Pike and Miller discuss potential pitfalls of using cholesterol depletion to determine lipid raft function. They noted that most researchers were using acute methods of cholesterol depletion, which disrupt the rafts, but also disrupt another lipid known as PI(4,5)P2. PI(4,5)P2 plays a large role in regulating the cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton, and disrupting PI(4,5)P2 causes many of the same results as this type of cholesterol depletion, including lateral diffusion of the proteins in the membrane. Because the methods disrupt both rafts and PI(4,5)P2, Kwik et al. concluded that loss of a particular cellular function after cholesterol depletion cannot necessarily be attributed solely to lipid raft disruption, as other processes independent of rafts may also be affected. Finally, while lipid rafts are believed to be connected in some way to proteins, Edidin argues that proteins attract the lipids in the raft by interactions of proteins with the acyl chains on the lipids, and not the other way around.

<text>William John McKeag, (17 March 1928 – 23 August 2007) was a Manitoba politician and office-holder. He served as the province&#x27;s 17th Lieutenant Governor between 1970 and 1976.

McKeag was born in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He served as general manager of Security Storage Limited (a family business) from 1952 until his appointment in 1970. He also established the McKeag-Harris Reality and Development company in 1960.

In 1958, McKeag ran for the Manitoba legislature as a Liberal-Progressive candidate in the upscale Winnipeg riding of River Heights. This was the year in which Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives ended forty-three years of Liberal and Progressive rule, and McKeag was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate W.B. Scarth.

From 1966 to 1969, McKeag was a councilor in the town of Tuxedo, prior to its merger with Winnipeg. He was also chairman of the Greater Winnipeg Election Committee from 1968 to 1970.

McKeag, at the age of 42, was the youngest lieutenant governor in Manitoba&#x27;s history when he was appointed by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau in 1970. However, the office of lieutenant governor is a ceremonial post, and he had almost no practical influence over the government of Edward Schreyer.

McKeag was appointed Honorary Colonel of The Fort Garry Horse on 26 June 1973 and held the appointment until 22 January 2000.

McKeag was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1996, and the Order of Manitoba in 2000.

McKeag died on 23 August 2007 at the age of 79. He was survived by his wife, Dawn, who is the daughter of former Premier Douglas Campbell as well as three daughters and one son.

<text>The Primitives are an English indie pop band from Coventry, best known for their 1988 international hit single &quot;Crash&quot;. Formed in 1984, disbanded in 1992 and reformed in 2009, the band&#x27;s two constant members throughout their recording career have been vocalist Tracy Tracy and guitarist Paul &quot;PJ&quot; Court. Drummer Tig Williams has been a constant member since 1987. Often described as an indie pop or indie rock band, the Primitives&#x27; musical style can also be seen as straddling power pop, new wave and post-punk.

== Early career and mainstream success (1986–1994) ==
The Primitives were formed in the summer of 1984 by PJ Court (born Paul Jonathan Court) (vocals, guitar), Steve Dullaghan (born Stephen Anthony Dullaghan, ex–Nocturnal Babies) (bass guitar), Peter Tweedie (drums) and Keiron McDermott, ex-Nocturnal Babies (vocals). Vocalist McDermott was later replaced by Tracy Tracy (born Tracy Louise Cattell). Tig Williams replaced Pete Tweedie on drums in October 1987.

McDermott left the band claiming that he could not work with new manager Wayne Morris, and so reformed the Nocturnal Babies. Needing a singer for an upcoming gig, Court wrote on a piece of scrap paper &quot;male singer wanted&quot; and posted it at the Coventry library. Tracy responded that afternoon.

The band were part of the indie music scene of the mid-1980s, alongside bands like the Soup Dragons and the Wedding Present. Their major rivals within the &#x27;blonde pop&#x27; scene were Transvision Vamp and the Darling Buds. They received valuable publicity when the Smiths&#x27; lead vocalist Morrissey was photographed wearing a Primitives T-shirt.

The band&#x27;s early singles were released on their own Lazy Records imprint. In late 1987, they signed the label over to RCA, which released the band&#x27;s material from then until their split.

&quot;Lovely&quot; (1988), the band&#x27;s debut studio album, reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart, and produced two top 40 hit singles: &quot;Crash&quot; (UK No. 5, US Modern Rock No. 3) and &quot;Out of Reach&quot; (UK No. 25). &quot;Crash&quot;, and the band were described in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;the perfect band who have made the perfect single&quot;.

&quot;Way Behind Me&quot; was released as a single soon after, and was included on later versions of the debut album, as well as on the follow-up studio album &quot;Pure&quot;. 1988 was the band&#x27;s peak year; in addition to the hit album and singles, the band undertook a sell-out tour of the UK, ending in two nights in May at London&#x27;s Town &amp; Country Club.

The studio album &quot;Pure&quot; (1989) was preceded by three singles: &quot;Way Behind Me&quot; (UK No. 36, US Modern Rock No. 8), &quot;Sick of It&quot; (UK No. 24, US Modern Rock No. 9) and &quot;Secrets&quot;, (UK No. 49, US Modern Rock No. 12).

In 1990, the band co-headlined a tour of the US with the Sugarcubes as well as a short tour of Japan. They split in 1992 following the commercial failure of their third studio album &quot;Galore&quot; (1992). Their song &quot;Crash&quot; was featured on the soundtrack album for the Peter Farrelly film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; in 1994.

== Reformation (2009–present) ==
Steve Dullaghan died in Coventry on 4 February 2009, following which, after nearly 18 years of dormancy, the Primitives re-formed, with new bassist Raphael Moore. Their first live shows were in Coventry and at the Buffalo Bar in London in October 2009. In early 2010, the Primitives toured the UK and performed a single US concert at The Bell House in New York City. The Primitives supported the Wedding Present at Koko in Camden, London on 13 December 2010 as part of that band&#x27;s &quot;Bizarro&quot; album 21st anniversary tour.

The Primitives returned to the studio with original producer Paul Sampson, recording the EP &quot;Never Kill a Secret&quot;, featuring two original songs — the title track and &quot;Rattle My Cage&quot; — and two cover versions of lesser-known female-fronted songs — &quot;Need All the Help I Can Get&quot; (written by Lee Hazlewood and originally recorded by Suzi Jane Hokom in 1966) and &quot;Breakaway&quot; (originally recorded by Toni Basil in 1966). The EP was released on 7 March 2011. The album &quot;Echoes and Rhymes&quot; followed in 2012, featuring 14 further recordings of lesser-known female-fronted songs. The Japanese edition of &quot;Echoes and Rhymes&quot; features three additional bonus tracks, two of which are remix versions of &quot;Need All the Help I Can Get&quot; and &quot;Breakaway&quot;. The third bonus track &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Want&quot;, also featured on the digital EP &quot;Turn Off the Moon&quot;.

Their original track &quot;You Trashed My Christmas&quot; is featured on the Elefant Records compilation album &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Elefant Records&quot;. An accompanying video for the track was released. In March 2013, the compilation album &quot;Everything&#x27;s Shining Bright – The Lazy Recordings 1985 – 1987&quot; was issued. The compilation featured all of the Lazy releases; unreleased, different versions of songs that were on &quot;Lovely&quot;; some 1985 demos; and the 1987 ICA show, with Morrissey introducing the band on stage.

The single &quot;Lose the Reason&quot; was released on 18 February 2013 through Elefant Records. &quot;Spin-O-Rama&quot;, the group&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released on Elefant on 13 October 2014, and it was preceded by the release of the title track as a 7&quot; and download single.

In April 2017, the four-song collection &quot;New Thrills&quot; was released. The first 1,000 copies were personally autographed by band members. Included with the album was a code and instructions for digital download of the tracks:
# &quot;I&#x27;ll Trust the Wind&quot;
# &quot;Squeak &#x27;N&#x27; Squawk&quot;
# &quot;Oh Honey Sweet&quot; 
# &quot;Same Stuff&quot;

The group toured California in June 2017, playing in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. In April 2019, The Primitives visited Tokyo.

<text>Jadrolinija is a Croatian shipping company. It is a state-owned company and its main mission is connecting Croatian islands to the mainland by operating regular passenger and cargo transport services. The company mainly operates car ferries on domestic routes along the Croatian coast, as well as international routes across the Adriatic Sea to Italy (to ports at Ancona and Bari).

Jadrolinija currently operates a fleet of 54 vessel: it has several large car ferries; &quot;Zadar&quot;, &quot;Dalmacija&quot; &quot;Marko Polo&quot; which are used on international routes mostly to Bari and Ancona in Italy. There are also 38 smaller ferries used for local passenger service, 12 catamarans and four smaller conventional ships. The fleet&#x27;s total carrying capacity is 4,084 vehicles and 29,902 passengers.

Jadrolinija was founded in Rijeka on 20 January 1947 as a continuation of various smaller shipping companies which had operated along the Croatian coast since 1872. In 2023, its ships carried 12,411,217 passengers and 3,579,647 vehicles.

== Projects ==
In January 2022, Minister Oleg Butković announced the procurement of six new ships, three passenger ships, two of which are hybrid-powered up to 45 meters in length and three catamarans. It is expected that two will be built in 2023. One of the ships should replace the MS Postira.

In November 2022, Jadrolinija announced a tender for the sale of MF Dubrovnik at a price of 2.85 million euros. The competition lasts until March 2023. The ship was eventually sold to the Greek company A-Ships.

In December 2022, Jadrolinija announced a tender for the purchase of a used ferry, between 100-110 m long, 17-19 m wide and 2.9 m draft, with a passenger capacity of at least 500 in winter and 700 in summer. The tender was canceled in May 2023, but was announced again in June 2023. At the opening of bids, only one bid worth 7.695 million euros was received, from Livadas Shipping Co. from Greece. On 13 July Jadrolinija accepted the offer and bought ship even after media writing about the unsuitability of the ship for navigation in the Adriatic. The ship was renamed as MF Sveti Duje after the Saint Domnius.

In January 2023, a tender was announced for the procurement of three new electrically powered passenger ships. The ships should sail in the Dubrovnik area, on the line to the Elafites, in the Šibenik area, where they will maintain a connection with Prvić, Zlarin and other islands, and in the Lošinj archipelago, if necessary, use them on other lines as well. The approximate length of the ships should be about 45 to 50 meters, with a transport capacity of about 390 passengers. The planned value of each of the ships, according to unofficial announcements, is around EUR 15 million, with co-financing by EU funds in the amount of 65 percent of their total value. These ships should be built by the end of 2026 at the latest, and by then HEP, together with the competent port authorities, should provide adequate connections for charging their batteries in the ports where they will dock. This year, Jadrolinija intends to start the construction of a new ferry for the Zadar water area. The tender was eventually annulled as none of the contestants met the conditions, which led to publication of new tender for which the application deadline is 1 August. Second tender led to choosing Kraljevica Shipyard as builder with a full arrangement to be concluded and ships to be built until the end of 2026.

In April 2023, a tender was announced for the purchase of two catamarans, for which Jadrolinija is ready to pay up to 14 million euros without VAT. The condition for these ships is that they must be up to 5 years old, up to 40 meters long and up to 12 meters wide, each with a capacity of at least 300 passengers, and intended for international routes on the Adriatic Sea. Offers for these fast passenger ships are accepted until May 3rd 2023. On 15 July 2023 Jadrolinija presented HSC Danica and HSC Kata as new catamarans bought from TP line for 13.4 million euros without VAT.

In August 2023, the state shipowner announced a public procurement worth 18.3 million euros, according to which the ships must not be older than two years. The technical specifications, among other things, foresee a length of 40 meters, a width of 12 meters, a minimum speed of 27 knots and a capacity of a minimum of 300 passengers, and the material of manufacture must be aluminum. The ships must be delivered no later than the last day of June 2024, and the offer deadline is September 26, 2023.

On 20 February 2024, Jadrolinija put MS Unije (ex Panagia Εvaggelistria) in service on line Mali Lošinj – Unije – Vele Srakane – Susak. The ship was bought for 2 million euros in April 2023 from Star Gem Maritime Company located in Greece.

<text>Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Zappia (; born 13 June 1952) is an Australian politician and former powerlifting champion. He has been an Australian Labor Party member for the House of Representatives seat of Makin in South Australia since the 2007 election.

==Early life==
Born in Platì, Italy, as a child Zappia moved with his family to Pooraka, where he attended primary school and Enfield High School. From 1969 he worked for ANZ Bank. From 1976 to 1980, Zappia was employed as a research officer to Senator Jim Cavanagh. Zappia was Mayor of the City of Salisbury from 1997 to 2007 and a Councillor from 1977.

Zappia has run three fitness centres. Zappia has also won ten National Championships in powerlifting.

==Parliament==

From Makin&#x27;s creation ahead of the 1984 election, the seat was always marginal and held by the party of government, often typical of mortgage belt seats. However, Zappia defeated Liberal candidate Bob Day at the 2007 election with a 57.7 percent two-party vote from an 8.6-point two-party swing as Labor won government, the largest two-party vote and swing of any party in Makin&#x27;s history at the time, and was also the first time a Makin candidate won a majority of the primary vote. At the 2010 election, Zappia technically made it a safe Labor seat with a 62.2 percent two-party vote, again becoming the largest of any party in Makin&#x27;s history. Zappia held the seat at the 2013 election with a reduced 55.1 percent two-party vote even as Labor lost government, albeit still the largest two-party vote, aside from 2010 and 2007, of any party in Makin&#x27;s history. No longer a bellwether for the first time, Zappia became the first opposition member in the seat&#x27;s history.

In September 2023, Zappia joined a cross-party delegation of Australian MPs to Washington, D.C., to lobby the U.S. Department of Justice to abandon its attempts to extradite Australian publisher Julian Assange from the United Kingdom. The other members were Alex Antic, Barnaby Joyce, Monique Ryan, David Shoebridge, and Peter Whish-Wilson.

==Personal life==
Zappia lives in Pooraka with his wife Vicki and has three children.

<doc id="958806" wikidata="Q447026" url="?curid=958806" title="Augusto Monterroso">
<text>Augusto Monterroso Bonilla (December 21, 1921 – February 8, 2003) was a Honduran writer who adopted Guatemalan nationality, known for the ironical and humorous style of his short stories. He is considered an important figure in the Latin American &quot;Boom&quot; generation, and received several awards, including the Prince of Asturias Award in Literature (2000), Miguel Ángel Asturias National Prize in Literature (1997), and Juan Rulfo Award (1996).
Monterroso was a member of the Honduran Academy of Language.
==Life==

Monterroso was born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, to a Honduran mother and Guatemalan father. In 1936 his family settled definitively in Guatemala City, where he would remain until early adulthood. Here he published his first short stories and began his clandestine work against the dictatorship of Jorge Ubico. To this end he founded the newspaper &quot;El Espectador&quot; with a group of other writers.

He was detained and exiled to Mexico City in 1944 for his opposition to the dictatorial regime. Shortly after his arrival in Mexico, the revolutionary government of Jacobo Arbenz triumphed in Guatemala, and Monterroso was assigned to a minor post in the Guatemalan embassy in Mexico. In 1953 he moved briefly to Bolivia upon being named Guatemalan consul in La Paz. He relocated to Santiago de Chile in 1954, when Arbenz&#x27;s government was toppled with help and intervention of the United States of America.

In 1956 he returned definitively to Mexico City, where he would occupy various academic and editorial posts and continue his work as a writer for the rest of his life.

In 1988, Augusto Monterroso received the highest honor the Mexican government can bestow on foreign dignitaries, the Águila Azteca. He was also awarded the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award, in 2000. In 1997, Monterroso was awarded the Guatemala National Prize in Literature for his body of work.

He died of heart failure at the age of 81 on February 8th, 2003, in Mexico City.

==Work==
Although Monterroso limited himself almost exclusively to the short story form, he is widely considered a central figure in the Latin American Boom, a movement centered on the work of a group of young Latin American novelists. He is recognized alongside such canonical authors as Julio Cortázar, Carlos Fuentes, Juan Rulfo and Gabriel García Márquez.

Save for &quot;Lo demás es silencio&quot; (&quot;The Rest is Silence&quot;), his foray into the form of the novel, Monterroso only published short pieces. He worked throughout his career to perfect the short story form, often delving into analogous genres (most famously the fable) for stylistic and thematic inspiration. Even &quot;Lo demás es silencio&quot;, however, largely eschews the traditional novelistic form, opting instead for the loose aggregation of various apocryphal short texts (newspaper clippings, testimonials, diary entries, poems) to sketch the &quot;biography&quot; of its fictional main character.

Monterroso also was known for popularizing short stories and was the author of what is often credited to be one of the world&#x27;s shortest stories, &quot;El Dinosaurio&quot; (&quot;The Dinosaur&quot;), published in &quot;Obras completas (Y otros cuentos)&quot;. The story reads, in its entirety:

: &quot;Cuando despertó, el dinosaurio todavía estaba allí.&quot;
: (&quot;When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.&quot;)

Carlos Fuentes wrote of Monterroso (referring specifically to &quot;The Black Sheep and Other Fables&quot;): &quot;Imagine Borges&#x27; fantastical bestiary having tea with Alice. Imagine Jonathan Swift and James Thurber exchanging notes. Imagine a frog from Calaveras County who has seriously read Mark Twain. Meet Monterroso.&quot;

<text>Pearl Kathryne McGonigal (born June 10, 1929) is a retired Manitoba politician and office-holder. She was a prominent Winnipeg-area municipal politician from 1969 to 1981, and served as the province&#x27;s 19th Lieutenant Governor from October 23, 1981 to December 11, 1986. She was the first woman to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and only the second woman to serve as a viceroy in Canadian history, after Pauline McGibbon of Ontario.

McGonigal was born in Melville, Saskatchewan. Before entering politics, she spent nine years in the banking sector and seven as a merchandising representative.

McGonigal was elected to the city council of St. James-Assiniboia in 1969, two years before its amalgamation with Winnipeg. Following amalgamation, she served on the Greater City Council from 1971 to 1981, and was the city&#x27;s Deputy Mayor from 1979 to 1981. Throughout her time on council, she was a member of the Independent Citizens&#x27; Election Committee, an unofficial alliance of right-wing and pro-development interest groups in the city (McGonigal&#x27;s husband was a prominent Winnipeg-area developer).

McGonigal was appointed Lt. Governor of Manitoba by Governor General Edward Schreyer, on the advice of Pierre Trudeau, in 1981. The office was essentially a ceremonial post by this time, and McGonigal had little if any practical influence over the government of Howard Pawley during her time in office. She was notable, however, as the first woman in Manitoba (and only the second in Canada) to hold such a position.

McGonigal has also worked as the Manitoba chair of the Council for Canadian Unity. She was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1994 and the Order of Manitoba in 2000. In 2003, she received the President&#x27;s Award from the Winnipeg Press Club. She is a gourmet cook that has written regular columns on the subject in Winnipeg&#x27;s daily and community newspapers.

Also during the early 2000s, McGonigal served as Chairman of the Canadian Forces Liaison Council in Manitoba, which regularly lobbies public bodies and private businesses to grant time off to military reservists for training purposes.

<text>Pop Up Video is a VH1 television show that shows music videos annotated via &quot;pop-up&quot; bubbles — officially called &quot;info nuggets&quot; — containing trivia and witticisms relating to the video in question. The show was created by Woody Thompson and Tad Low and premiered October 27, 1996. For a time, it was the highest-rated program on VH1, though &quot;Behind the Music&quot; overtook it by 1998. It was originally produced by Spin the Bottle Inc., and later by Eyeboogie Inc. during its original run.

In October 2011, &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; was revived by VH1, featuring new videos with new trivia and commentary. The revived production was continued by Eyeboogie Inc.

The show&#x27;s pioneering use of pop-up bubbles to provide additional information about what is happening onscreen has seen many imitators and parodies, as well as some official licensed spinoffs, including &quot;Pop Up Video UK&quot;.

==Format==
Most episodes of &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; play four or five music videos each, selected to include new, older, &quot;classic&quot;, and &quot;campy&quot; videos. The bubbles that pop up in each video generally appear about every 10–15 seconds; their content is divided between information about the recording artist featured, the production of the video, and random facts inspired by the theme or content of the video. One of the show&#x27;s staff writers is assigned to each video. Production costs for each episode total about $30,000.

The &quot;random&quot; information presented in bubbles frequently included statistics and demographics, medical, scientific, and historical trivia, definitions, and lists of a wide range of subjects. Gary Burns, in the &quot;Journal of Popular Film and Television&quot;, also notes as a recurring theme &quot;the producers&#x27; attempt to turn practically every popped-up video into a dirty joke.&quot;

Often the film crew for the video in question would be interviewed in the research process; everyone from the director to make-up artists, choreographers, models, and extras might be used as sources. In addition, the producers solicited information by means of a phone line (displayed during the closing credits) and web site page. General facts are double- or triple-sourced, according to the producers.

==History==
Thompson and Low previously worked together on Brandon Tartikoff&#x27;s late night talk show &quot;Last Call&quot;, before it was cancelled in 1994. They spent the next two years making pitches of ideas for television shows to various networks; in late 1995, the original iteration of the show concept, titled &quot;Pop Up Videos&quot;, was sent to VH1 executives, alongside a number of other concepts making use of aspects of songs or music videos. The pilot episode cost $3000 to produce; the first video to be played on the show was Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Missing You&quot;.

1997 saw &quot;Pop Up Video&quot;&#x27;s profile expand as popular news publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; all produced articles about the show.

In 2000, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that Low was no longer involved with the production of the show.

==Specials and other versions==
Special episodes of &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; aired throughout the series&#x27; run. Many focused on specific artists, including VH1 staples Madonna, Culture Club, U2, Prince, and Elton John. Others ran on different themes, such as &quot;Women First,&quot; &quot;Road Trip,&quot; &quot;Movies,&quot; and &quot;Duets&quot;. There were also several holiday specials, including Halloween and several Christmas episodes. Some theme episodes broke with the show&#x27;s format by including a montage of clips from many videos.

During a week of 1980s-themed programming on VH1 in March 1998, &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; became &quot;Pop Up &#x27;80s&quot;. These episodes featured additional clips of 1980s news events and pop culture tidbits between music videos.

The 1996 &quot;VH1 Fashion Awards,&quot; &quot;Divas Live,&quot; &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; (aired in syndication), several episodes of &quot;the Brady Bunch&quot; (aired on Nick at Nite in 2001, effectively named &quot;Pop Up Brady&quot;), ABC&#x27;s Original TGIF 1998 and 1999 line-up&#x27;s season premieres and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; (December 2000) also got the &quot;Pop Up&quot; treatment. Other proposals, such as a &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; edition of the entirety of &quot;Grease&quot; during its 1998 theatrical re-release, were never realized. It was also used in a second version of the remake of the original 1974 Meow Mix commercial in 2002, which lacks the lyrics.

A United Kingdom-specific version entitled &quot;Pop Up Video UK&quot;, aired on Channel 4, and still occasionally airs on VH1 UK and Europe. This version featured music videos by British artists such as Robbie Williams, Spice Girls, and Elvis Costello.

In January 2000, the spinoff program &quot;Pop Up Quiz&quot; debuted on VH1. Utilizing the same format as &quot;Pop Up Video&quot;, the show presented trivia questions inspired by the content of each music video shown; for example, the game &quot;Phil in the blank&quot; was played over the video for &quot;Sussudio&quot; by Phil Collins. Launched at a time when the &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; brand had become a &quot;veritable franchise&quot;, the show was called a &quot;weak spin-off&quot; among several &quot;duds&quot; launched by the network at the time.

The 25th anniversary DVD release of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; features a &quot;Pop Up&quot; video clip of one of the film&#x27;s musical numbers, &quot;Hot Patootie – Bless My Soul&quot;, as an extra on the second disc.

MSG Network currently airs a show called &quot;TXT MSG&quot;, which gives the &quot;pop up&quot; treatment to classic sporting events from MSG&#x27;s library. This is an official Spin the Bottle production, and Low is credited as an executive producer.

==Controversy==
Artists such as Billy Joel, Jakob Dylan of The Wallflowers, and The Police, as well as others such as director Mark Pellington and Sony Music Entertainment president Tommy Mottola complained about what they perceived as harsh treatment on the show and the videos in which they were featured were pulled. The show&#x27;s creators called these the &quot;Pops They Stopped.&quot; In contrast, some artists, including Joan Osborne and Paula Abdul, made appearances on the show to provide further information on their popped videos.

==Reception and commentary==
&quot;Pop Up Video&quot; is most frequently compared to the contemporaneous television programs &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot; and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, which were known for their on-screen commentary ridiculing, respectively, music videos and films. As these shows were described as &quot;TV-for-people-who-are-sick-of-TV&quot;, &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; has been called &quot;a show for people who hate videos&quot;.

==Reboot==
VH1 ordered 60 new half-hour episodes of &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; that started airing on October 3, 2011. In addition to the traditional music video format, five of the most popular episodes from season one of &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; were given the pop-up treatment in spring of 2012. A second season aired starting on August 6, 2012. The series was not renewed for a third season.

==Derivatives and parodies==
Early on, the show&#x27;s popularity led to several copycats, most notably on an episode of the ABC television series &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; (September 19, 1997) and a series of Bell Atlantic commercials. Spin The Bottle, the creators of &quot;Pop Up Video&quot;, publicly derided these &quot;Pop Up&quot; imitators on its website. Some series, such as &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;, &quot;High School Musical&quot; (and its sequels), &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Cake Boss&quot; and &quot;Kate Plus 8&quot; also featured special or repeat episodes that employed pop-up facts.

The History Channel series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; and its spinoff, &quot;Cajun Pawn Stars&quot;, also employ the use of pop-up style notes when explaining the item being sold or pawned.

At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; ran a series of &quot;Pop-Off Video&quot; takeoffs which mocked the artists, their fashions, their songs, and their music videos.

The North American anime distributor A.D. Vision (ADV Films) incorporated a feature on some of its DVD releases called &quot;AD Vid-Notes,&quot; which provided trivia and cultural notes in pop-up bubbles when the feature was turned on. ADV-released shows incorporating the feature included &quot;Excel Saga&quot; and &quot;Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi&quot;.

A similar show is aired on the Argentine TV channel I.Sat. It is called &quot;Video Maní&quot; (peanut video), because the pop-ups are a 3-D rotating peanut. It features a series of true/false questions on things regarding the theme of the video, and after a few seconds it shows &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. As I.Sat is a movie channel, the videos are used as fill between movies.

Disney Channel occasionally uses &quot;Pop-Up&quot; styled videos during special airings of DCOMs, such as &quot;High School Musical 2&quot; and &quot;Jump In!&quot;. These are referred to as the &quot;What&#x27;s What Edition&quot;.

The 2000 parody slasher Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th preceded the reveal with two protagonists being chased by the killer while a Pop-Up Video parody played to a cover of Pretty in Pink (song).

In 2001, Nick at Nite created &quot;Pop-Up Brady&quot;, which took select episodes of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and added pop-up trivia notes collected by Woody Thompson from interviews with cast members. The NickMom series &quot;What Was Carol Brady Thinking?&quot; featured a &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot;-style format to show satirical thoughts of how Carol Brady regarded scenes during episodes of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;; this was a non-Spin the Bottle production and had no involvement from anyone with the &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; series, including Florence Henderson.

In 2006, NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt Jr. hosted &quot;Back in the Day with Dale Jr.&quot; which highlighted racing from the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s with a &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot; style format.

At the end of the 2007 romantic comedy &quot;Music and Lyrics&quot;, the love story of characters Alex Fletcher and Sophie Fisher is epilogued in &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot; style, over the video for Alex and his old band&#x27;s first hit, PoP! Goes My Heart&quot;.

In 2010, Nicktoons released a &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot; style format for all 61 episodes of &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;Avatar Extras&quot;.

In 2014, HGTV released &quot;House Hunters Pop&#x27;d&quot; featuring families looking to purchase a home while trivia questions and facts pop up on the screen.

<text>USS &quot;Sturgeon&quot; (SSN-637), was the lead ship of her class of nuclear-powered attack submarines. She was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Sturgeon&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division, of General Dynamics Corporation, in Groton, Connecticut, on 30 November 1961, and her keel was laid down there on 10 August 1963. She was launched on 26 February 1966, sponsored by Louella Carver, the wife of United States Senator Everett Dirksen, of Illinois, and commissioned on 3 March 1967.

==Service history==

===1968–1970===

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; spent a month conducting refresher training and then began her shakedown cruise on 3 April 1967, down the United States East Coast and to Puerto Rico. She returned to Groton, for repairs, alterations, maintenance, and training until 18 September 1967, when she departed on extended operations. She returned to port on 2 October 1967, and was transferred to Submarine Development Group 2. On 22 January 1968, she began a five-week antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercise to evaluate the relative effectiveness of and attack submarines.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; began a three-month post-shakedown period of alterations and repairs on 3 March 1968. When the shipyard work was completed in June 1968, she participated in the search for the missing attack submarine in the vicinity of the Azores. She spent July and August 1968, preparing for overseas deployment, then was deployed from September to early November 1968. She participated in tests and evaluation of a new sonar detection device from December 1968 to February 1969. She visited the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in March 1969, and then held an intensive training period for her crew before deploying from May to July 1969. In April 1969, she was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for outstanding service during a period in 1968.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; participated in fleet submarine exercises in August and September 1969, and in a project for the Chief of Naval Operations from 29 September to 31 October 1969. She was awarded a second Meritorious Unit Commendation, in December 1969, for her service during a period earlier in 1969. After training and preparation for another period at sea, she deployed from 29 January to 8 April 1970. In May and June 1970, she aided in evaluating aircraft antisubmarine warfare tactics and equipment. She spent the period from 1 July to 26 July 1970, in a submarine exercise, and from 15 August to 1 September 1970, in sound trials. On 5 October 1970, she began an overhaul at Groton, which lasted until 5 October 1971. While in the shipyard in December 1970, &quot;Sturgeon&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service during a period earlier that year.

===1971–1994===

When &quot;Sturgeon&quot; completed her overhaul in October 1971, she was transferred to Submarine Squadron 10, based at New London, Connecticut. She held refresher training and completed a shakedown cruise from 6 October to 15 December 1971. The period from 16 December 1971 through 16 January 1972, was a leave and upkeep period. She then participated in two ASW exercises before returning to Groton, for repairs and alterations, from 6 March to 27 May 1972. She conducted sea trials until 15 July 1972, at which time she began a test on sonar systems which lasted until mid-December 1972.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; spent the period from 1 January to 2 April 1973, conducting local operations in the area around Narragansett Bay. On 3 April 1973, she departed for the Fleet Weapons Range in the Caribbean. On 21 May 1973, she ran aground near St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, while making . She sustained damage to her bow and was forced to return to Groton, on 4 June 1973, to repair the damage.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; returned to sea for local operations from 17 July to 1 October 1973, when she entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, at Kittery, Maine, to effect bow repairs. She remained in the shipyard until 22 April 1974. After sea trials, she returned to her home port, New London, for a ten-day upkeep period. She operated from New London, until 13 August 1974, when she departed for Norfolk, Virginia, to join other fleet units participating in Atlantic Readiness Exercise 1-75. She then returned to New London, to hold local training exercises in preparation for an overseas movement.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; stood out to sea on 29 November 1974, en route to the Mediterranean, and a scheduled six-month deployment there with the United States Sixth Fleet. She arrived in the Mediterranean, on 9 December 1974.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; performed ICEX &#x27;89 in the late winter and early spring of 1989, surfacing through the ice in the Arctic Circle.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; was undergoing a refit in Charleston Naval Shipyard when Hurricane Hugo struck Charleston, South Carolina, on 21 September 1989, and was unable to leave the port during the storm.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; was decommissioned on 1 August 1994, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, at Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 11 December 1995.

==Commemoration==
On 15 September 1995, at the Naval Undersea Museum, in Keyport, Washington, a ceremony commemorated the transfer of &quot;Sturgeon&quot;″s sail from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The sail is now located in the museum&#x27;s parking lot. The control center is now on display at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut.

<text>Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture is a 2002 book by Susan Hopkins. It is a cultural analysis of the contemporary archetype of the girl hero in popular culture.

Hopkins argues for a link between the 1990s British band Spice Girls, their vision of girl power, and the creation of a new kind of &quot;girl hero&quot;. Hopkins also explores the roles of figures such as supermodels, magical girls, Carmen Sandiego, Britney Spears, Lara Croft, Xena, Dana Scully, the Charlie&#x27;s Angels (the 2000s version), Sabrina Spellman, Mulan, and Buffy Summers.

She also draws comparisons between these images and earlier ones, such as Emma Peel of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, the 1970s television show &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, Madonna and the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; TV show of the 1970s, pointing out the relative independence of this archetype from male and parental support.

<text>Heinz G. Konsalik, pseudonym of Heinz Günther (28 May 1921 – 2 October 1999) was a German novelist. Konsalik was his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

During the Second World War he was a war correspondent, which provided many experiences for his novels.

Many of his books deal with war and showed the German human side of things as experienced by their soldiers and families at home, for instance &quot;Das geschenkte Gesicht&quot; (&quot;Mask My Agony / The Changed Face&quot;) which deals with a German soldier&#x27;s recovery after his sledge ran over an anti-personnel mine and destroyed his face, and how this affected his relationship with his wife at home. It places no judgment on the German position in the war and simply deals with human beings in often desperate situations, doing what they were forced to do under German military law. &quot;Der Arzt von Stalingrad&quot; (&quot;The Naked Earth / The Doctor of Stalingrad&quot;) made him famous and was adapted as a movie in 1958. Some 83 million copies sold of his 155 novels made him the most popular German novelist of the postwar era and many of his novels were translated and sold through book clubs. He is buried in Cologne.

==Life and work in the Nazi era==
At the age of 16, Günther wrote feature articles for Cologne newspapers. In 1938 he published what he considered his “first usable poem.” On 31 August 1939 he completed the heroic tragedy &quot;Der Geuse&quot; (“The Beggar”) as a senior secondary student. He then joined the Hitler Youth, Area 11, Middle Rhine Valley. In December 1939 he started working for the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police. His next drama, which he completed in March 1940, was called &quot;Gutenberg&quot;. In the same year Günther sought membership in the Nazi writer&#x27;s union, the Reich Chamber of Writers (&quot;Reichsschrifttumskammer&quot;) but was initially rejected due to the limited scope of his literary work. Later, however, having met the requirements, he received the chamber membership required for regular publication of literary works.

After graduating from the Humboldt-Gymnasium in Cologne, which required membership in the Nazi party and the teaching of its discredited but then pervasive racial theories, he studied medicine and later switched to theatre studies, literary history and German literature. During World War II he became a war correspondent in France and later came to the Eastern Front as a soldier, where he suffered a serious arm wound at Smolensk in the Soviet Union. He was later to describe his wartime experiences in Russia as a “monstrous school.”

<text>CFCF-DT (channel 12) is an English-language television station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. It is owned and operated by network parent Bell Media alongside Noovo flagship CFJP-DT (channel 35). The two stations share studios at the Bell Media building (formerly the Montréal Téléport), at the intersection of Avenue Papineau and Boulevard René-Lévesque Est in downtown Montreal; CFCF-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Royal.

==History==

===Canadian Marconi Company (1961–1972)===
CFCF-TV was founded by the Canadian Marconi Company, owner of CFCF radio (600 AM, later CINW on 940 AM before its closure in 2010; and 106.5 FM, now CKBE-FM at 92.5), after several failed attempts to gain a licence, beginning in 1938, and then each year after World War II. In 1960, it finally gained a licence, and began broadcasting on January 20, 1961 at 5:45 p.m. It was the second privately owned English language station in Quebec; CKMI-TV in Quebec City had signed on four years earlier in March 1957.
The station was originally located above the Avon Theatre. The first night on-air was fraught with problems. A power failure interrupted the opening ceremony, and later on, police raided the downstairs ballroom, with sirens blazing and a number of arrests made. The station&#x27;s newscast, &quot;Pulse News&quot;, faced a few problems because of the noise from the ballroom. CFCF-AM-FM-TV moved into their own facilities at 405 Ogilvy Avenue in Montreal&#x27;s Park Extension neighbourhood on May 19.

Channel 12 joined CTV as a charter affiliate on October 1, 1961. However, despite its status as CTV&#x27;s second-largest affiliate, its relationship with CTV was somewhat acrimonious over the years. Canadian Marconi, as would channel 12&#x27;s numerous owners over the years, felt CTV&#x27;s flagship station, CFTO-TV in Toronto, had too much influence over the network.

===Multiple Access (1972–1979)===
In 1968, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) required that all broadcasting outlets be 80% Canadian owned. Canadian Marconi was a subsidiary of the UK-based General Electric Company plc, and was forced to put its entire broadcasting division—CFCF-TV, CFCF (AM), CFQR-FM and CFCX—on the market. A deal to sell the stations to Ernie Bushnell, owner of CJOH-TV in Ottawa, collapsed in the spring of 1971 when Bushnell was unable to secure the necessary financing. Later in 1971, Canadian Marconi agreed to sell the stations to computer and telecommunications company Multiple Access Ltd., owned by the Bronfman family. In so doing, Canadian Marconi earned a handsome return on its original investment in CFCF, which long claimed to be the oldest radio station in Canada.

Multiple Access bought the stations after the CRTC refused to approve purchase offers by Baton Broadcasting, owner of CFTO (other CTV partners opposed the sale, and Baton was not interested in buying the radio stations without channel 12 being included in the purchase), and by CHUM Limited (because of indecision over which radio stations would be sold to meet radio ownership limits in Montreal). Multiple Access also was co-owner of CITY-TV in Toronto (with CHUM) during this time (both Baton and CHUM-CITY, minus CHUM&#x27;s television stations, became CTVglobemedia, which was later in turn became Bell Media, the current owner of CTV and CFCF).

===CFCF Inc. (1979–1992)===
In 1979, Multiple Access sold the stations and its production company, Champlain Productions, to CFCF Inc., headed by Jean Pouliot. This came after a deal by Baton (this time a willing partner) to purchase Multiple Access&#x27; Montreal broadcasting operations fell through. CHUM successfully purchased Multiple Access&#x27; Toronto operations (its share of CITY-TV). Later on, the station began broadcasting a 24-hour schedule full of classic television shows and movies during the late night hours, because of the popularity of VHS and Betamax VCRs by that time. As of the present day, the station now airs mostly infomercials in late night.

CFCF Inc., expanded to include the assets of CF Cable TV, which was acquired by Pouliot in 1982, and went public in 1985. In 1986, CFCF gained a sister station: CFJP-TV, the flagship station of Pouliot&#x27;s new French language network, Television Quatre-Saisons (TQS); now known as Noovo. TQS spent most of its early years in serious financial difficulty; the revenues from channel 12 were all that kept it afloat. Two years later, the radio stations were sold to Mount-Royal Broadcasting, and moved out of the CFCF building a year later. 1986 also saw CFCF become the home base for a Canadian game show: &quot;The New Chain Reaction&quot; was taped there, as was the French counterpart, &quot;Action Réaction&quot;. &quot;Chain&quot; was initially hosted by Canadian musician Blake Emmons, but he quit after only a few weeks. Producer Bob Stewart then brought in Geoff Edwards to replace him; in turn, CFCF staff announcer Rod Charlebois was then given an on-air role, to satisfy CanCon requirements. This version ran until 1991 on Global in Canada and in America on the USA Network.

===Canwest Global and Videotron (1992–1997)===
Financial relief came to the company in the 1990s with an investment from Canwest Global Communications. In return, CFCF did not stand in the way of Canwest&#x27;s plans to apply for a Global repeater station in Montreal. However, Canwest Global changed its mind, citing tax problems. It did, however, allow CFCF to carry some Global programs; it was already airing some programming from Citytv. This would not be the end of Global&#x27;s influence at the station.

In 1997, TVA sold controlling interest in CKMI to Canwest. The two companies announced plans to turn CKMI into a Global station, along with a CKMI repeater in Montreal and a large studio complex in Montreal. Pouliot was scared by the prospect of new competition and decided to get out. He initially planned to sell CFCF to Vidéotron. However, Vidéotron also owned TVA, which retained a 49 percent stake in CKMI. This would have resulted in one company having a significant stake in all of the private stations in Montreal – CFCF, CKMI, CFJP and TVA flagship CFTM-TV.

Vidéotron knew that the CRTC would never approve such an arrangement, so it sold CFCF to Western International Communications (WIC), who also owned CHAN-TV and CHEK-TV in British Columbia, CHCH-TV in Ontario and several stations in Alberta. Over the next few years, CFCF cut back its carriage of CTV programming to little more than the base schedule of 40 hours per week. This was due to longstanding tensions between WIC and CTV (stemming from similar issues to those raised by CFCF, in that they felt CFTO and Baton had too much influence over the network); the station filled out the rest of their schedule with WIC&#x27;s own library of programming. This didn&#x27;t pose a problem at first, since Ottawa&#x27;s CJOH was available on cable in Montreal for most of the 1980s and 1990s; CJOH operates a repeater in Cornwall, Ontario whose footprint reaches Montreal. Meanwhile, TQS was sold to Quebecor, and later to Cogeco and Bell Globemedia (which later became CTVglobemedia and is now known as Bell Media).

Before 1997, when CHCH and CITY launched rebroadcast transmitters in the Ottawa region, local cable companies there carried CFCF as well. Because CHCH and CFCF were sharing some programs, CFCF was removed from these systems, except for Rogers Cable. Also around this time, CJOH was dropped from Montreal cable systems after its owner, Baton, bought controlling interest in CTV.

===CTV (2001–present)===

Canwest bought WIC&#x27;s television assets in 2000. However, the CRTC did not allow Canwest to twinstick CFCF with CKMI. The commission believed that the Montreal region&#x27;s anglophone population was too small to allow a twinstick of the city&#x27;s private anglophone stations. It did, however, allow Canwest to keep CJNT-TV, a multicultural station WIC had bought a year earlier. CFCF was placed under trusteeship, and had to be sold in short order. In 2001, amid all these wranglings over ownership, Bell Globemedia, owner of CTV, bought the station. After 40 years of being master of its own house to a large degree, CFCF lost much of that independence and maneuverability through the CTV/Bell Globemedia deal.

With the opening of the Fall 2001 television season, CFCF officially adopted the full CTV schedule. The newscast dropped its longtime &quot;Pulse&quot; title in favour of the generic &quot;CFCF News&quot;. However, the &quot;Pulse&quot; brand was so firmly established that viewers still continued to called the newscasts by that title for several years. The station also adopted a new golden call letter logo similar to all other CTV owned stations, as well as similar promo and newscast graphics.

In 2003, CFCF left its location on Ogilvy Avenue it had occupied since 1961 and moved to a studio on Papineau Avenue in the eastern part of downtown, and the master control operations were moved to 9 Channel Nine Court in Toronto, the home of CTV flagship CFTO. By this situation, CFCF overtook Vancouver&#x27;s CIVT-TV to become the largest market with a CTV O&amp;O station whose studios were located in a downtown area (Toronto&#x27;s CFTO-TV/DT had operated in the same 9 Channel Nine Court studios since its inception). The area has now become Montreal&#x27;s main media district. In addition to sister Bell Media properties Noovo and RDS, which are located in the same building as CFCF, the studio facilities of CBC/Radio-Canada, TVA, Télé-Québec, MétéoMédia and Bell Media&#x27;s radio stations are all within several blocks. 

On October 3, 2005, the station dropped the use of its call letters on-air, instead branding as simply &quot;CTV&quot;, with the newscast becoming &quot;CTV News&quot;. This type of rebranding was instituted at all affiliates across the country to provide a common brand for the entire network.

By 2005, Bell Globemedia was considered to be a non-core asset by parent company Bell Canada Enterprises and was sold to a group of investors, which included the Thomson family. The Bell Globemedia group (made up of the entire CTV network, as well as &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper and a variety of other channels and media assets) was renamed CTVglobemedia in late 2006. In April 2011, BCE re-acquired full ownership of CTVglobemedia and changed the new division&#x27;s name to Bell Media. The new media giant also acquired CHUM Limited&#x27;s holdings in 2006, including the A-Channel stations, MuchMusic and a variety of other specialty channels. But the CHUM deal also raised serious questions about the high degree of media concentration in Canada. This new conglomerate owned more than one television station in several Canadian markets—increasing the worry about job losses and cutbacks.

In 2009, CFCF discontinued the &quot;Telethon of Stars&quot; that aired during the first weekend of December, consecutively, for 32 years from 1977 to 2009; the removal of the telethon from the station was due to budget cuts made by CTV as a result of the economic crisis. In December 2010, the &quot;Telethon of Stars&quot; could only be seen through the Internet (via an 8-hour webcast), with no television equivalent broadcast. It was dropped entirely shortly thereafter.

On August 5, 2009, CTV camera operator, 44-year-old Hugh Haugland was killed after a helicopter crash near Mont-Laurier about from Montreal, Haugland was shooting footage of the destruction left behind by a tornado that touched down in the area on August 4, 2009. Haugland was the son of Canadian journalist and retired former television news anchor for CFCF-TV in Montreal, Bill Haugland. The other person killed in the crash was Roger Belanger, a veteran pilot and local businessman who was in his 60s.

On August 16, 2024, a water main break on René Lévesque Boulevard caused the flooding and evacuation of CFCF&#x27;s main studio and newsroom, as well as the closure of those facilities for eventual restoration. The flood destroyed several pieces of equipment stored in the station&#x27;s basement, including satellite trucks and field equipment. Newscast production was temporarily moved to the offices of corporate parent BCE Inc. on nearby Nuns&#x27; Island.

==Programming==
CFCF airs the standard CTV schedule in pattern with CFTO; its only major difference had previously been the scheduling of certain syndicated programs in CTV&#x27;s afternoon lineup to allow for simsubs with Burlington, Vermont–Plattsburgh, New York stations on cable (particularly &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, which aired at 5 p.m. instead of 3 p.m. to simsub WVNY), but this was rendered moot when the shows were replaced by library sitcom reruns on the national schedule upon their conclusions.

In the past, some children&#x27;s programming was preempted due to provincial regulations on advertising; the station now carries CTV&#x27;s few remaining children&#x27;s programs with public service announcements during ad breaks. As well, CFCF did not carry either &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; or &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; when these were part of the standard CTV schedule; both were picked up by the CBC nationally in the fall of 2008, only for them to be discarded in the fall of 2011.

CFCF has always been the highest-rated television station for Anglophone Quebecers. As well, a significant number of bilingual Francophones also watch CFCF—for both programming and news—although CFTM, CFJP and CBFT-DT (Radio-Canada) are the obvious market leaders for Quebec&#x27;s French community.

==News operation==
CFCF-DT presently dedicates 13 hours of air-time for locally produced newscasts each week (with 2 hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station&#x27;s studios in Downtown Montreal also house the CTV News network division&#x27;s Montreal news bureau.

Since 1986, one of CFCF&#x27;s lead evening anchors has been Mutsumi Takahashi. Matt Grillo temporarily fills the spot of lead anchor of the weekend edition and Maya Johnson anchors the 5 and 11:30 p.m. bulletins. One of its most famous anchors, Bill Haugland, is now retired; his last newscast aired on November 30, 2006. Haugland worked at CFCF for more than 40 years. He covered major stories in the 1960s and 1970s before becoming the lead anchor at CFCF in the late-1970s. Haugland was an institution and in a special &quot;Farewell to Bill&quot; show broadcast on his final day, he was heralded by colleagues, viewers and former prime ministers alike. In December 2006, Haugland was replaced on an interim basis by Brian Britt, another CFCF veteran newscaster, until he too retired on July 24, 2008. Todd van der Heyden took over from Britt as co-anchor up until the end of 2011. Currently, Mutsumi Takahashi is the station&#x27;s sole anchor for 6 p.m. evening broadcasts, as Bell Media eliminated the co-anchor position due to cost-cutting measures.

Until March 10, 2009, CFCF aired a weekday morning newscast at 6 a.m. called &quot;First News&quot;, which pre-empted the first half hour of &quot;Canada AM&quot;; anchored by Herb Luft, it was cancelled in favor of an early start time for &quot;Canada AM&quot;, which was then seen in its entirety starting at 6 a.m. Morning news briefs seen during &quot;Canada AM&quot; were also cancelled. Luft would continue his role as reporter for the station, until retiring in June 2010. These cancellations were part of continuing cutbacks made by CTV due to the economic crisis.

On May 11, 2011, it was announced that longtime 11:30 p.m. news anchor Debra Arbec had left the station to become the main anchor at CBC O&amp;O CBMT-DT. Various other anchors filled in the void for the remainder of May and then June 2011. CTV reporter/former CJAD and CJFM news announcer Catherine Sherriffs became Arbec&#x27;s permanent replacement on July 4, 2011.

On December 2, 2011, Todd van der Heyden announced he would step down at the end of the month to become an anchor at CTV News Channel in Toronto. Beginning in 2012, weekend anchor Paul Karwatsky was appointed as interim anchor to replace Van der Heyden while a permanent anchor was found. During the evening, on January 18, 2012, it was made official that Karwatsky would occupy the permanent co-anchor position.

On July 29, 2014, several layoffs were announced by CTV Montreal&#x27;s general manager. Among them was Catherine Sherriffs, who at the time was on maternity leave, and was told her job anchoring the 11:30 p.m. newscast was no more. Instead, Paul Karwatsky, already co-anchoring the 6 p.m. and occasionally the 11:30 p.m. news, took over as anchor for the 11:30 p.m. spot permanently.

On June 20, 2017, local sportscast programming was cancelled, resulting in the immediate layoff of the entire sports department, which included long-time anchor Randy Tieman, reporter Brian Wilde and weekend anchor Sean Coleman (a dedicated sports department had been part of CFCF-12 since its inception, and once even included noted and retired hockey broadcaster Dick Irvin; for 30 years, between 1961 and 1991, Irvin had been a longtime veteran sports director and anchor at the station).

On November 14, 2017, long-time executive producer Barry Wilson, best known for his Postscript editorial, was laid off as part of Bell Media&#x27;s ongoing cost-cutting measures.

In December 2018, long-time weekend anchor Tarah Schwartz left CTV.

In January 2020, news reporter and weekend anchor Annie DeMelt left CTV to join the MUHC Communications team.

On September 4, 2020, news anchor Paul Karwatsky left CTV, with Caroline Van Vlaardingen filling the spot on an interim basis. It was announced on November 9 that Maya Johnson would take over as anchor for the 5 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. news.

On February 1, 2021, as part of Bell Media&#x27;s ongoing cost-cutting, it announced the elimination of its Quebec City reporter position.

On June 2, 2022, long-time news director Jed Kahane was laid off as part of Bell Media&#x27;s ongoing cost-cutting measures.

On September 29, 2023, long-time news reporter Cindy Sherwin left CTV.

On November 13, 2023, Bell Media cut local 5 p.m. news broadcasts down to just 30 minutes, replacing the latter half with a &quot;CTV National News&quot; feed from 5:30 to 5:59 p.m.

On November 26, 2023, weekend news anchor Amanda Kline left CTV, with initially Caroline Van Vlaardingen, then Matt Grillo, filling the spot on an interim basis.

On February 8, 2024, as part of Bell Media&#x27;s largest cost-cutting in nearly 30 years, the station cancelled its local noon and holiday newscasts. Additionally, reporter Vanessa Lee, long time production assistant and movie reviewer Mosé Persico (of nearly 40 years), weather presenter Lise McAuley (of nearly 25 years) and assignment editor Derek Conlon (of nearly 20 years) were laid off.

On May 30, 2024, long-time weather specialist Lori Graham (of over 25 years) left CTV.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
The station began providing a high definition feed to Videotron and Bell Fibe on December 1, 2009, and in September 2010 respectively. Its digital signal signed on over-the-air on temporary pre-transition UHF channel 51 on January 28, 2011.

On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, the station relocated its digital signal from channel 51 to VHF channel 12. The shutdown of its analog signal and temporary digital transmitter occurred just after its 11:30 p.m. newscast that evening.

<doc id="958850" wikidata="Q703018" url="?curid=958850" title="Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar">
<text>[[Sayyid]] Barghash bin Said al-Busaidi (1836 – 26 March 1888) (), an Afro-Omani Sultan and the son of Said bin Sultan, was the second Sultan of Zanzibar. He ruled Zanzibar from 7 October 1870 to 26 March 1888.

==Life and reign==
Barghash was born around 1836–1838 to Omani sultan, Said bin Sultan and an Ethiopian concubine. He was described as having sharp and charming character. He succeeded his elder half-brother Majid in 1871, having openly and adamantly contested his rule, and at one point was arrested for treason and exiled to India and Bombay. 

Upon becoming sultan his reign became successful and is credited with building much of the infrastructure of Stone Town, including piped water, public baths, a police force, roads, parks, hospitals and large administrative buildings such as the (Bait el-Ajaib) House of Wonders. He was perhaps the last Sultan to maintain a measure of true independence from European control. He consulted with European &quot;advisors&quot; who had immense influence, but he was still the central figure they wrestled to control. He crossed wits with diplomats from Britain, America, Germany, France and Portugal and was often able to play one country off against another. It was his son, Khalid bin Barghash, who while vying for the succession, was the loser in the Shortest War. 
In 1859 a dispute broke out between the brothers Sayyid Majid, the second Sultan of Zanzibar, and Barghash. Their sister Sayyida Salme bint Said (later Emily Ruete) acted (at the age of fifteen) as secretary of Barghash&#x27;s party. However, with the help of an English gunboat the insurrection of Barghash was soon brought to an end, and Barghash was sent into exile in Bombay for two years.

After the death of Majid, Barghash became Sultan. Ruote wrote in 1886:

According to Ruete, Barghash did not release Khalifah before one of their sisters prepared to set out for a pilgrimage for Mecca, and &quot;he did not want to bring down upon himself a curse pronounced in the Holy City of the Prophet. But his sister did not pardon him before he had set free the innocent Chalîfe.&quot;

Sayyid Barghash had a treaty with the British to help stop the Zanzibar slave trade, but he was not always scrupulous in his commitment. In the late-1860s, he was suspected of taking money from the slave traders to allow them to continue the practice, and he maintained this double deal for some years; HMS &quot;Daphne&quot; liberated 2000 slaves in the Indian Ocean over many years, mainly near Zanzibar.

In June 1873 John Kirk was acting British Consul and received simultaneous and contradictory instructions from London, one to issue an ultimatum to the Sultan under threat of blockade that the slave trade must be unequivocally stopped and the slave market closed, and the other not to actually enforce a blockade which might be taken as an act of war pushing Zanzibar towards French protection. Kirk only showed the first instruction to Barghash, who capitulated within two weeks signing a further treaty with Britain prohibiting slave trade in his kingdom, and immediately closing the great slave market.

Towards the end of his reign Barghash had to witness the disintegration of his inherited empire. In 1884 the German adventurer Carl Peters made African chiefs on the Tanganyika mainland sign documents which declared their areas to be under German &quot;protection&quot;. In February 1885 these acquisitions were ratified by the German Government through an imperial letter of protection. Few weeks later in April 1885, the German Dehnhardt brothers concluded a contract with the Sultan of Witu (former ruler of Pate) on the Kenya Coast near Lamu which was also put under official German protection. Bargash tried to send troops against the Witu ruler who in his view anyhow was supposed to be his subject when the appearance of a German fleet forced him to accept the German intrusion.

The British-German agreement of 29 October 1886 acknowledged the Sultan&#x27;s rule over a 10-mile-strip along the coast from Portuguese Mozambique up to the Tana River and some towns on the Southeast African coast. This agreement, however, was only short-lived as it cut the German areas of influence off the sea.

Bargash did not live to see the 1888 agreement come into force which signed off the coastal strip of later Tanganyika to the Germans resulting in the uprising of the Sultans&#x27; subjects against the Germans and its subsequent repression.

In 1896, Bargash&#x27;s son Khalid proclaimed himself sultan but was deposed after rejecting a British ultimatum which led to the 40 minute Anglo-Zanzibar War.

<doc id="958851" wikidata="Q7057868" url="?curid=958851" title="Northeast Corridor Line">
<text>The Northeast Corridor Line is a commuter rail service operated by NJ Transit between the Trenton Transit Center and New York Penn Station on Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor in the United States. The service is the successor to Pennsylvania Railroad commuter trains between Trenton and New York, and is NJ Transit&#x27;s busiest commuter rail service. After arrival at New York Penn Station, some trains load passengers and return to New Jersey, while others continue east to Sunnyside Yard for storage. Most servicing is done at the Morrisville Yard, at the west end of the line. 

The Northeast Corridor Line is colored red on NJ Transit system maps and its symbol is the New Jersey State House. The Princeton Branch is a shuttle service connecting to the line. Connecting SEPTA Trenton Line service between Philadelphia and Trenton is listed in the timetable.

== History ==
===19th century===

Service on what is now the Northeast Corridor dates to the 1830s, with trains originating and terminating at the PRR&#x27;s terminal at Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey, which was the terminus of the PRR&#x27;s network for most of the 19th century.

In December 1855, work to extend the line&#x27;s second track from Elizabethtown to Rahway was completed, eliminating the need for trains to meet in single-track territory. The New Jersey Railroad Board approved a contract for the rails for the second track between New Brunswick and Rahway to Cooper &amp; Hewitt on February 5, 1859. The completion of the second track was authorized by the Board on April 23, 1859. 

In May 1859, the New Jersey Railroad began work on the project. The second track was completed in November, completing the second track from New Brunswick to Jersey City.

In June 1873, the PRR began grading the right-of-way to widen the line from two to four tracks between Rahway and Elizabeth. In September 1873, the two additional tracks were completed between Scott Street in Rahway and Linden, and grading for the third track between Elizabeth and Waverly was underway.

In March 1882, the PRR completed the four tracking of the line between Houtenville and South Elizabeth with the completion of a four-track bridge over the Rahway River in Rahway. On April 1, 1882, Uniontown station was renamed Iselin. On November 5, 1882, the new PX interlocking tower was placed into service at Perth Amboy Junction in Rahway. 

In 1885, with the exception of through the cities of Trenton, New Brunswick, Elizabeth, and Newark, the line was completely four tracked between Trenton and Jersey City.

===20th century===
Penn Station opened in 1910, but was originally designed for long distance passenger trains. As a result, steam-hauled commuter traffic continued to use the older Jersey City station.

On May 10, 1914, the new DX tower at Rahway was placed into service. Newly elevated tracks 3 and 4 were completed that year between Colonia and North Rahway. In addition, a new station was built at Linden. 

The new northbound tracks at Linden opened on July 9, 1914. In 1915, the six tracking of the line between South Elizabeth and Colonia was completed, including grade separation work in Rahway and Linden. On July 11, 1915, the westbound platforms at Rahway and the flying junction with the Perth Amboy Branch were completed. The new Rahway station was completed on December 1, 1915.

On September 25, 1929, the PRR Board authorized the extension of the line&#x27;s fifth and sixth tracks between &quot;LANE&quot; and &quot;ELMORA&quot; interlockings. The Board authorized the widening of the line&#x27;s right-of-way between Elizabeth and Trenton on October 9, 1929. 

On November 1, 1929, the PRR announced it would build a new $1.75 million station at Trenton. This plan was abandoned in the Spring as a result of the Great Depression.

On April 15, 1930, the section of eastbound track 1 between Colonia station and St. George Street in Rahway was relocated to ground level. The jump over track completed in 1914 and 1915 was abandoned. On July 3, 1930, the PRR notified officials in Elizabeth that it would abandon plans to widen the line to six tracks between &quot;LANE&quot; and &quot;ELMORA&quot; as acquiring the condemnation award for the 30-foot wide strips was $290,828, when the railroad had estimated the cost would be $56,000. On September 10, 1930, the tracks on the line between &quot;UNION&quot; in Rahway and Colonia were realigned to eliminate a curve.

After overhead catenary lines were built between Trenton and Penn Station, it was possible to run trains of electric multiple units direct to Manhattan. Accordingly, the PRR began running commuter trains from Trenton to Penn Station in 1933.

The three westernmost tracks at the new Pennsylvania Station in Newark opened for operation on March 24, 1935. An old swing bridge was replaced by a new three-track lift Dock Bridge. In addition, &quot;DOCK&quot; tower, located at the east end of the station, was put into service.

The PRR Board authorized the construction of a new waiting room and concrete platform at Rahway on June 26, 1940.

The weekday schedule in September 1951 had six trains a day from New York City to Trenton, seven from New York City to New Brunswick, two from Jersey City to Trenton and six from Jersey City to New Brunswick. That includes just the trains that terminated at Trenton or New Brunswick; many more trains from New York City to Philadelphia and beyond carried passengers to some suburban stations.

By the 1960s, the financial situation of the Pennsylvania Railroad began deteriorating. With the railroad unable to sustain the money losing commuter operation, let alone invest in improved physical plant and rolling stock, the New Jersey Department of Transportation became involved with maintaining the service. 

In 1968, NJDOT funded construction of the new Metropark station. The following year, in 1969, they funded 35 new stainless steel &quot;Jersey Arrow&quot; MU cars. 

After 1968, the service was taken over by the merged Penn Central railroad and following the Penn Central&#x27;s bankruptcy the commuter service was taken over by Conrail in 1976. Conrail continued to operate the line under contract to NJDOT. The state continued to fund replacement of the aging pre-war MU equipment with the Arrow II and Arrow III orders. Finally in 1983, NJ Transit, which already operated nearly all bus service in New Jersey, took over all of Conrail&#x27;s commuter lines, including the Northeast Corridor Line.

===Clockers===
&quot;Clocker&quot; trains were started by the Pennsylvania Railroad between Philadelphia and New York City; until the 1950s, weekday trains departed New York City and Philadelphia on the hour through the day, giving rise to the Clocker name. After the Amtrak takeover of the Northeast Corridor the no-longer-hourly &quot;Clocker&quot; service was targeted at commuters making local stops bypassed by the high speed Metroliner and individually named trains. 

During the 1990s, NJ Transit contracted with Amtrak to accept monthly NJ Transit passholders on the Clocker trains. Soon the Clockers were primarily used by NJ Transit commuters with only a handful of riders taking the trains to or from Philadelphia; the Clockers were much faster (and more comfortable) than a typical NJ Transit train, but slower and more crowded than a typical Amtrak train causing the former&#x27;s riders to prefer the trains and the latter&#x27;s riders to avoid them.

With most Clocker riders using NJ Transit tickets, NJ Transit supplied new ALP-46 locomotives to haul the trains&#x27; Amfleet coaches; Amtrak soon discontinued the Clocker service altogether and sold the capacity slots to NJ Transit for new Trenton express trains. The Clocker last ran on October 28, 2005, and thereafter NJ Transit began several extra Trenton-New York express trips.

== Service ==
During the peak period, stations between North Elizabeth and Rahway are mostly covered by North Jersey Coast Line trains. Stations between Rahway and New Brunswick are served by Jersey Avenue Locals, which originate and terminate at Jersey Avenue station in New Brunswick, while Trenton Express trains make their first or last stop at Princeton Junction or New Brunswick. A few all-stops locals operate sporadically on weekdays as well and all day on weekends. Jersey Avenue Locals make local stops between Rahway and Elizabeth outside peak periods. North Elizabeth station is skipped by most NEC Line trains and trains cannot stop at Jersey Ave eastbound.

The line&#x27;s route is part of the middle leg of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. All eleven of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor services run along this line. New York Penn, Newark Penn, and Trenton have long been among Amtrak&#x27;s busiest stations; connections to Amtrak are also available at Newark International Liberty Airport, Metropark, New Brunswick, and Princeton Junction. With fast and frequent Amtrak and NJ Transit service, the Trenton to New York City portion of the Northeast Corridor is one of the busiest rail lines in North America.

== Ridership ==
With high levels of service and a route through one of the most densely populated areas of the United States, the Northeast Corridor Line is New Jersey Transit&#x27;s busiest rail line. On an average weekday in 2012, the Northeast Corridor Line handled 117,400 boardings. The line also contains all of New Jersey Transit&#x27;s busiest non-terminal stations: Metropark with 7,447 boardings; Princeton Junction with 6,816; Trenton with 4,638; and New Brunswick with 4,976 weekday boardings.

== Rolling stock ==

All service on the Northeast Corridor Line is electric via overhead lines and uses either Budd/GE Arrow III multiple unit cars during rush hours and normally one to two sets on the weekends, and push-pull locomotive trains hauled by ALP-46, an electric or ALP-45DP dual-mode locomotive, at all times. These trains are made up of Comet series cars or Bombardier Transportation MultiLevels.

== Line improvements ==
The modern era of commuter operations began in 1983 when New Jersey Transit Rail Operations took over the service from Conrail. Since that time, numerous changes to the line intended to improve New Jersey Transit service have been made. These include the following.

=== Morrisville Yard ===
The Morrisville Yard is used for train layups. In 2007 NJT opened a new 19-track yard on the site of the former Pennsylvania Railroad freight classification yard across the Delaware River in Morrisville, Pennsylvania. The new yard replaced the haphazard collection of storage tracks around the Trenton Station complex. This not only increased the absolute number of trains that could be stored at the end of the line, but also reduced the number of relay movements needed to position trains in at the correct platform at Trenton. Capacity was also increased by trains no longer having to cross all four mainline tracks to access their storage tracks as the new Morrisville yard is accessed by a flying junction.

===Trenton Transit Center===
The Trenton Transit Center is the beginning of the New Jersey Transit portion of the Northeast Corridor line and the terminus of SEPTA&#x27;s Trenton Line service. The Trenton station is also a major stop for Amtrak trains, serving 2 Acelas, most Northeast Regional trains, most &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains, and nearly all medium and long distance trains running along the Northeast Corridor.

In 2004 the River Line light rail Trenton station opened across the street, creating a rail link between the Northeast Corridor Line and Camden and the riverfront communities of Burlington County that did not require crossing the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. In 2008 the station was formally renamed the Trenton Transit Center as the station was overhauled, including the complete replacement of the station headhouse and concourse structure which had last been rebuilt during the 1960s. The new station has more space for vendors and passengers.

=== Hamilton station ===

Hamilton Station in Hamilton Township opened in 1999, costing $30 million (1992 USD). With almost direct access to Interstate 295, park and ride capacity was large with 1,556 spaces available at the station&#x27;s opening. Due to the popularity of the station with commuters arriving via Interstate from points south in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, a parking deck was added in 2007 with 2,066 more spaces for a total of 3,622. The station has sculptures and designs from the Grounds for Sculpture, a sculpture park in Hamilton.

Hamilton Station did much to alleviate the increasingly desperate parking situations in Trenton and Princeton Junction. Trenton&#x27;s downtown station is hard to reach and has little space for parking; Princeton Junction has no direct access to a major highway and its vast parking lot had long since reached capacity. The Hamilton Station was built for New York area commuters traveling increasing distances to work. Its direct freeway access and ample parking proved a hit with riders and it is one of the busiest stations on the New Jersey Transit system. The conversion of the nearby American Standard factory into transit oriented development led to further ridership gains. A new NJ Transit bus garage was also built within the station complex replacing an older garage formerly used by NJ Transit, and Mercer Metro within the City of Trenton.

=== Metropark station ===

The Metropark rail station project was initiated by NJDOT in 1968 as part of a plan to accommodate businesses and commuters that were fleeing the old urban cores. The station opened in 1971 next to the Garden State Parkway for easy access by automobile; nearby stations at Iselin and Colonia closed soon after. The new station was also designed with the new Metroliner Service in mind with high level platforms and a large business park to make the new station a destination in itself. To allow Metroliners and other express trains to stop at Metropark new crossovers were installed in the 1980s on either side of the station to allow trains on the inner express tracks to pull over and stop at the two side platforms.

=== Newark Airport station ===

Newark Liberty International Airport Station was built in conjunction with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the owner of Newark Liberty International Airport. This station allows passengers to connect with AirTrain Newark, the airport&#x27;s monorail. The station opened in late 2001 and was part of a larger project to increase capacity south of Newark Penn Station. Along with the station&#x27;s two island platforms, two tracks were added for a mile east and west of the station, bringing the number of tracks on this section of the corridor to 6. This allows some NJT express and Amtrak trains to pass local trains. The station was deliberately built as a train/monorail transfer station, as there is no direct pedestrian access, bus service, parking facility, or drop-off area. While the Port Authority has studied plans to extend PATH to Newark Airport station, these plans were put on hold in 2023.

=== Kearny and Waterfront Connections ===
The Waterfront Connection opened in 1991, allowing eastward trains from the ex-PRR Northeast Corridor to connect to ex-DL&amp;W Morris and Essex Lines to Hoboken Terminal. No NEC trains serve Hoboken Terminal as of January 2010 (in the 1990s there was one Hoboken-Trenton train a day) but a few North Jersey Coast Line trains run across the connection during weekday peak hours, allowing NEC passengers to transfer. At other times, passengers must transfer using PATH.

The Kearny Connection opened in 1996, allowing the opposite connection, eastward from ex-DL&amp;W to ex-PRR, and many Morristown Line trains now use it to reach New York Penn Station.

=== Secaucus Junction ===

Opened in 2003, Secaucus Junction was built as a major transfer hub for the New Jersey Transit system. Built where the Corridor crosses over the Main/Bergen/Port Jervis lines, the station allows passengers on Hoboken-bound trains to switch to trains to New York Penn Station, and vice versa. The station also allows for transfers to the Meadowlands Rail Line for service to MetLife Stadium.

== Planned improvements ==
=== North Brunswick station ===
A new station along the NEC at North Brunswick was approved by New Jersey Transit Rail Operations in 2013. In 2017, the New Jersey Legislature allocated $50 million for the project through the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund, letting the project move forward. In 2019, the Middlesex County Improvement Authority was tasked with management of the project, a first between NJT and a county. In October 2020, the project&#x27;s initial funding was approved. In October 2021, a contract with WSP USA was executed for design and engineering of the station, with it proceeding a month later. In January 2022, a consensus regarding location and design was reached. By the end of 2022, 10% of the conceptual design was approved by NJT. In February 2023, renderings and the plans for the station were revealed, and the bid for construction is set to go out by the end of 2025.

=== Mid-line loop ===
NJT currently originates trains to New York during peak hours from the Jersey Avenue station in New Brunswick. As of 2013, the agency planned to build a flying junction and balloon loop called the Mid-Line Loop south of a new station south of Jersey Avenue in North Brunswick, allowing trains to turn around, enter and leave the Northeast Corridor without crossing over tracks.

=== County Yard &quot;train haven&quot; ===
In January 2014, NJT awarded a $7.64-million design and engineering contract to develop a &quot;train haven&quot; and re-inspection facility where equipment could be stored during serious storms at an expanded and reconfigured County Yard in New Brunswick following severe flooding after Hurricane Sandy, which demonstrated the vulnerability of the agency&#x27;s facilities to flooding.

<doc id="958854" wikidata="Q924354" url="?curid=958854" title="Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar">
<text>Sayyid Khalifa I bin Said al-Busaidi, GCMG, (or Chalîfe) (c. 1852 – 13 February 1890) () was the third Sultan of Zanzibar. He ruled Zanzibar from 26 March 1888 to 13 February 1890 and was succeeded by his brother, Ali bin Said.

==Life==
In 1870 his elder brother and predecessor Barghash bin Said had him imprisoned for the (alleged) entanglement in a coup attempt. According to their sister Emily Ruete, Barghash did not release Khalifah before one of their sisters prepared to set out for a pilgrimage for Mecca, and &quot;he did not want to bring down upon himself a curse pronounced in the Holy City of the Prophet. But his sister did not pardon him before he had set free the innocent Chalîfe.&quot;

Emily Ruete wrote in 1886:

According to Ruete, Barghash continued to spy on Khalifah and his friends. She notes one instance where Barghash apparently willfully ruined a wealthy chief and friend of Khalifah, so that Khalifah would be deprived of support from rich chiefs. He became Sultan upon the sudden death of his brother during the protracted negotiations with the German East Africa Company. Unlike his brother, he gave in to lease the Tanganyika coast of mainland East Africa to the Germans, which immediately led to the Abushiri Revolt.

Sayyid Khalifa I was appointed an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George on 18 December 1889.

<text>Anthony John Attwood (born 9 February 1952) is a British psychologist notable for his work on Asperger syndrome. He resides in Queensland, Australia, where he is an associate professor at Griffith University.

==Education==
He received an honours degree in psychology from the University of Hull, an M.A. in clinical psychology from the University of Surrey and a Ph.D. from University College London supervised by Uta Frith.

==Research and career==
His books include &quot;Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals&quot;, which has been translated into 20 languages and provides information on diagnosis, problems of social relations, sensory issues, motor control and other typical issues which face people with Asperger&#x27;s and their support networks. His other books include &quot;The Complete Guide to Aspergers Syndrome, Exploring Feelings for Young Children with High-Functioning Autism or Aspergers Disorder&quot;, and &quot;From Like to Love for Young People with Aspergers Syndrome (Autism Spectrum Disorder): Learning How to Express and Enjoy Affection with Family and Friends&quot;.

Attwood has a clinical practice at his diagnostic and treatment clinic for children and adults with Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome, in Brisbane, begun in 1992.

It took Attwood thirty years to notice that his own son, Will Attwood, was autistic, when rewatching childhood videos of him. Will had become addicted to drugs as a teenager and young adult and was jailed several times. He later wrote a book on his experience, &quot;Asperger’s Syndrome and Jail&quot;.

<doc id="958868" wikidata="Q456759" url="?curid=958868" title="Penny Wong">
<text>Penelope Ying-Yen Wong (born 5 November 1968) is an Australian politician who is serving as the minister for Foreign Affairs and leader of the Government in the Senate in the Albanese government since 2022. A member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), she has been a senator for South Australia since 2002. Wong previously served as minister for Climate Change and minister for Finance and Deregulation during the governments of Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard from 2007 until 2013.

Born in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia to a Chinese-Malaysian father from the town of Sandakan and an English-Australian mother from Adelaide, Wong was educated at Scotch College prior to attending the University of Adelaide, graduating with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. She then worked as a lawyer and political advisor. Wong entered politics by winning a Senate seat in the 2001 election.

Following Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2007 election, she was appointed Australia&#x27;s first-ever Minister for Climate Change, going on to represent the country at the landmark 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Following the 2010 election, Wong was moved to become Minister for Finance and Deregulation, and in June 2013, she was elected by her colleagues to become Leader of the Government in the Senate. Following Labor&#x27;s defeat in the 2013 election, Wong held several roles in the shadow cabinets of both Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese, serving as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate throughout. Upon Labor&#x27;s victory at the 2022 election, Wong was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, and resumed her role as Leader of the Government in the Senate.

In 2008, she became the first Asian-Australian in an Australian Cabinet. She was also the first female openly LGBTI Australian federal parliamentarian, and was an instrumental figure in the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia in 2017, reversing her previous endorsement of Labor Party policy that had opposed it. On 6 March 2024, Wong became longest-serving female cabinet minister in the history of the Australian Parliament. Several surveys have consistently found Wong to be the most trusted politician in Australia.

== Early life and education ==
Penelope Ying-Yen Wong was born on 5 November 1968 in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah, which had become part of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. Her parents were Jane (née Chapman) (died 2024), an English Australian whose forebears first reached South Australia on &quot;Cygnet&quot; in 1836, and Francis Wong (1941–2023), a Chinese-Malaysian architect-cum-town-planner of mixed Cantonese and Hakka descent who hailed from Sandakan, the former capital and second-largest city or town located in the state&#x27;s east coast. Penny Wong&#x27;s parents had met in the early 1960s, when Francis Wong was studying architecture at the University of Adelaide under the Colombo Plan. Wong grew up speaking Bahasa Malaysia (particularly the Sabahan dialect), Chinese (her native vernacular dialects of Cantonese and Hakka) in addition to English which was her first or home language spoken to her mixed-race parents. At five years old, she began attending the Kinabalu International School. After her parents separated, she moved to Adelaide, South Australia, at the age of eight with her mother and younger brother.

After starting at Coromandel Valley Primary School, Wong gained a scholarship to Scotch College, Adelaide, where she studied chemistry, physics and mathematics. During her time at Scotch College, Wong toured New Caledonia as part of her French-language studies, performed in school productions of plays such as &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;, and co-captained the hockey team. 

She was accepted into the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery at the University of Adelaide, but after spending a year on exchange in Brazil, found she had an aversion to blood. She then studied and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and a Bachelor of Laws with Honours at the University of Adelaide in 1993, followed by a Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice at the University of South Australia.

===Student politics and activism===
Through her friendship with David Penberthy, who had also been on exchange in Latin America, Wong joined the Socialist Workers Party-sponsored Committee in Solidarity with Central America and the Caribbean (CISCAC) while at university in 1987, but was not an active member. Wong&#x27;s connections with CISCAC brought her in contact with a broader group of left-wing activists who opposed the Hawke Labor government&#x27;s planned changes to university fees. In a July 1988 election, Wong won a position on the board of the Adelaide University Union as part of the newly formed Progressive Education Team. One month later, while protesting outside a state Labor Party convention at the Adelaide Trades Hall, Wong had a conversation with Young Labor member Lois Boswell, who told her that &quot;if you wanted to really make a difference, you had to be inside the room having that battle.&quot; Wong joined the Labor Party that day; she credits her decision to her conversation with Boswell, and the Liberal-National Coalition&#x27;s new &quot;One Australia&quot; policy opposing multiculturalism and Asian immigration.

Wong became involved with the leadership of the Adelaide University Labor Club, and has been a delegate to the South Australian Labor Party State Convention every year since 1989 (with the exception of 1995). 

She also worked part-time for the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), and won a position on the National Executive of the National Union of Students. A number of her contemporaries at university went on to become Australian politicians, including former senator for South Australia, Natasha Stott Despoja; former Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill; and health minister Mark Butler.

== Professional career==
After graduation, Wong continued her association with the CFMEU as an industrial officer. She was admitted to the South Australian Bar in 1993. During 1995 and 1996, Wong acted as an advisor to the CFMEU and to the newly elected New South Wales state government, specializing in the area of forest policy in the middle of the fierce 1990s environmental battles over logging in NSW.

On returning to Adelaide, Wong began practising law, working as a solicitor at the firm Duncan and Hannon (1996–1999). From 1999 to 2002, she worked as a legal officer with the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union. During this time she also won a position on the ALP&#x27;s state executive.

During her legal career (1996–2002), Wong appeared as counsel in eleven published decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, 15 published decisions of the South Australian Industrial Relations Court, eight published decisions of the South Australian Industrial Relations Commission, three published decisions of the South Australian Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal and ten published decisions of the South Australian Workers Compensation Tribunal.

==Political career==

=== Election to the Senate ===

Wong ran for pre-selection for the Senate in 2001, and was selected for the top position on the Labor Party&#x27;s South Australian ticket. She was elected at the 2001 election, her term commencing on 1 July 2002. Wong is a member of Labor Left, and is a member of EMILY&#x27;s List Australia, the support network for Labor women, and sat on a number of Senate committees, primarily those related to economics.

In June 2005, Wong was appointed Shadow Minister for Employment and Workforce Participation, and Shadow Minister for Corporate Governance and Responsibility. Following the reshuffle in December 2006, she became responsible for the portfolios of Public Administration and Accountability, Corporate Governance and Responsibility, and Workforce Participation.

===First Rudd government (2007–2013)===
In December 2007, in the wake of the Labor Party victory in the 2007 election, Wong was appointed to the Cabinet of Australia in the first Rudd government as the Minister for Climate Change, the first person to hold this role in an Australian Cabinet. She accompanied then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to Bali for the international climate change talks. Wong led final negotiations as Chair of the United Nations Working Group in the closing days of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2007, shortly after her appointment as minister.

===Gillard and Second Rudd governments (2010–2013)===
Shortly after the commencement of the Gillard government in June 2010, Julia Gillard promoted Wong to succeed Lindsay Tanner as Minister for Finance and Deregulation. At this time, Wong said she agreed with the Labor Party policy on marriage because there was a, &quot;cultural, religious and historical view of marriage being between a man and a woman&quot;.

In February 2013, Wong was elected as the ALP&#x27;s deputy Senate leader following the resignation of Chris Evans, thus becoming Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. Wong retained the position of Minister for Finance after Kevin Rudd&#x27;s successful leadership spill in June 2013. Following Stephen Conroy&#x27;s resignation and the beginning of the second Rudd government, she also became the Leader of the Government in the Senate. She was the first woman to be elected as ALP Senate leader, and the first woman to serve as Leader of the Government in the Senate. Wong held these roles until Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 2013 federal election.

===Opposition (2013–2022)===
Following Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 2013 Australian federal election, Wong was elected Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She was also appointed Labor&#x27;s foreign affairs spokesperson. In this role, she helped negotiate Australia&#x27;s interests in the Trans-Pacific Partnership which was ratified in late 2018. In March 2019, Wong was named the 2018 McKinnon Political Leader of the Year.

Following the 2019 Labor leadership contest, Wong retained her positions as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new cabinet of Anthony Albanese. At this point she was named part of Albanese&#x27;s four-person ALP leadership team, along with Richard Marles and Kristina Keneally.

===Albanese Government (2022–present)===
With Labor winning government in the 2022 Australian federal election, Wong became Minister for Foreign Affairs. She was sworn in on 23 May 2022, only two days after the election and before final results were known, in order to attend a pre-scheduled meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with newly elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Wong is the first Asian Australian and the first openly LGBTI person to hold the office of Australian Foreign Minister. Within a few days of being sworn into office, Wong visited several Pacific countries to emphasise the new government&#x27;s approach to climate change and relations with nations in the region, including Fiji (where she addressed the Pacific Islands Forum), Samoa and Tonga.

On 16 June 2022, Wong visited New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta to reaffirm bilateral relations and cooperation in the areas of climate change, indigenous and Indo-Pacific issues. Wong also stated that her government would consider New Zealand&#x27;s concerns about Australia&#x27;s Section 501 deportation policy, which had strained relations between the two countries.
During a 2023 Senate estimates hearing, Wong was asked about the presence of nuclear weapons aboard nuclear-capable B-52s and B2 Spirits U.S. bombers, which operate regularly out of northern Australia. When U.S. bombers visit Australia, the U.S. government does not tell the Australian government whether the aircraft are carrying nuclear weapons. Wong said the Australian Government &quot;understand[s] and respect[s] the longstanding U.S. policy of neither confirming or denying&quot;. She also said the government wanted a greater U.S. military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Wong sought to improve the relationship between Australia and China, which deteriorated after the previous Australian government under Scott Morrison wanted to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and condemned China&#x27;s mistreatment of ethnic Uyghurs.

Wong has expressed support for Israel during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. But, in August 2024, she was among world leaders who condemned Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich&#x27;s statement around &#x27;starving&#x27; Palestinians in Gaza until hostages are returned.

Wong paused funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in February 2024 after Israel alleged that 12 of the UNRWA&#x27;s 13,000 staff were either involved in the attacks by Hamas on 7 October or had links to Hamas. She said she was waiting for Israel to provide evidence for the allegations and said that the UNRWA was the only organisation providing substantive support to the occupied Palestinian territories. A report by Channel 4 in the UK said that a dossier provided by Israel to the United Nations contained no evidence to support its allegations; at the same time Wong said that Israel&#x27;s allegations were serious, noting that UNRWA itself had stated that an investigation was warranted.

On 6 March 2024 Wong became longest-serving female cabinet minister in the history of the Australian Parliament, setting a new record as she served her 2,769th day in cabinet and exceeding the number of days served by former Liberal senator Amanda Vanstone.

== Public image ==
Wong has been described by her biographer as &quot;principled, intellectual, private, restrained and sane&quot;. In 2022, Reuters described her as a &quot;high profile&quot; figure with &quot;a reputation for plain language and maintaining composure during heated debates.&quot; 

Several studies and surveys have consistently found Wong to be the most trusted politician in Australia among respondents. Wong has been consistently named as Australia&#x27;s most trusted politician through studies and opinion polling. Polling conducted by The Australia Institute in 2019 found that Wong was the most trusted federal legislator, though then-Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern topped the poll altogether. Studies taken in March 2022 and December 2023 by Roy Morgan Research found Wong to be Australia&#x27;s most trusted politician. Wong was deemed the most effective minister in the Albanese government in a survey of &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; readers in 2022 and 2023. Opinion polling undertaken by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; in December 2023 also found Wong to be the most liked politician in the country.

== Personal life ==
Wong is a practising Christian just like her late father, Francis and late paternal grandmother, Lai Fung Shim, for she is a congregant of the Pilgrim Uniting Church in Adelaide. She has said &quot;I do not ever remember having the sense that I denied the existence of God.&quot; Others in her wider family from Sabah are Buddhist, but she also has Christian relatives on her paternal family. She held Malaysian citizenship before renouncing it in 2001.

Wong is a lesbian and came out publicly a month after she assumed her Senate seat in 2002. In 2010, Wong was selected by readers of Samesame website as one of the 25 most influential lesbian Australians.

Wong&#x27;s wife, Sophie Allouache, is a public servant and former University of Adelaide Students&#x27; Association president. In December 2011, Allouache gave birth to their first child, after announcing the IVF-assisted pregnancy. Allouache gave birth to their second daughter in 2015. Wong and Allouache married in 2024.

Wong received media attention in June 2022, on a visit to Indonesia, for making a speech in fluent Indonesian; it is unclear whether she learned Indonesian separately, or was relying on the similarities between Indonesian and Malay, which she learned as a child in Malaysia.

<doc id="958872" wikidata="Q5540690" url="?curid=958872" title="George Holmes (historian)">
<text>George Arthur Holmes, FBA (born 22 April 1927 in Aberystwyth–died 29 January 2009) was Chichele Professor of Medieval History at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, 1989-94.

==Family, early life, and education==
Holmes was born at Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire, Wales, son of English watchmaker John Holmes and Welsh mother Margaret (née Thomas). John Holmes had moved from London to Wales to marry Margaret, whom he met on a cycling holiday.

Holmes was educated at Ardwyn County School and University College, Aberystwyth. He went on to Cambridge University for graduate study under M. M. Postan. In 1953, he married Anne Klein, a scholar of 19th century French literary culture. The couple had two sons and two daughters.

==Academic career==
In 1951, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge elected Holmes to a research fellowship. After having a year abroad at the University of Göttingen, in 1952-53, he moved to Oxford in 1954, where he became Tutor in Modern History at St Catherine&#x27;s Society. When the University granted that Society full collegiate status, he became one of the founding Fellows of St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford at its foundation in 1962. In 1967-68, Holmes spent a year at Princeton University. At St Catherine&#x27;s, he played an important role in establishing the academic credentials of the College, serving in a variety of College positions including vice-master in 1969-1971.

From 1974 to 1980, he edited the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;. Elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1985, he also served for many years as Delegate to Oxford University Press.

In 1993, the British Academy awarded Holmes its Serena Medal for Italian studies.

<doc id="958883" wikidata="Q2660870" url="?curid=958883" title="Head shaving">
<text>Head shaving is a form of body modification which involves shaving the hair from a person&#x27;s head. People throughout history have shaved all or part of their heads for diverse reasons including aesthetics, convenience, culture, fashion, practicality, punishment, a rite of passage, religion, or style.

==Early history==
The earliest historical records describing head shaving are from ancient Mediterranean cultures such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The Egyptian priest class ritualistically removed all hair from head to toe by plucking it.

==Religious significance==

Many Buddhists and Vaisnavas, especially Hare Krishnas, shave their heads. Some Hindu and most Buddhist monks and nuns shave their heads upon entering their order, and Buddhist monks and nuns in Korea have their heads shaved every 15 days. Muslim men have the choice of shaving their heads after performing the Umrah and Hajj, following the tradition of committing to Allah, but are not required to keep it permanently shaved.

==As a symbol of subordination==
===Enslaved peoples===

In many cultures throughout history, cutting or shaving the hair on men has been seen as a sign of subordination. In ancient Greece and much of Babylon, long hair was a symbol of economic and social power, while a shaved head was the sign of a slave. This was a way of the slave-owner establishing the slave&#x27;s body as their property by literally removing a part of their personhood and individuality.

===Military===

The practice of shaving heads has been widely used in the military. Although sometimes explained as being for hygiene reasons, the image of strict and disciplined conformity is also accepted as a factor. Upon the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II, some Allied soldiers shaved their heads to deny any Nazis the opportunity to grab it during hand-to-hand combat. For the new military recruit, it can be a rite of passage, and variations of it have become a badge of honor.

===Prison and punishment===
Prisoners commonly have their heads shaven to prevent the spread of lice, but it may also be used as a demeaning measure. Having the head shaved can be a punishment prescribed in law. Nazis punished people accused of racial mixing by parading them through the streets with shaved heads and placards around their necks detailing their acts.

During and after World War II, thousands of French women had their heads shaved in front of cheering crowds as punishment for either collaborating with the Nazis or having sexual relationships with Nazi soldiers during the war. Some Finnish women also had their heads shaved for allegedly having relationships with Soviet prisoners of war during the war.

==Practicality==
===Sport===

Competitive swimmers, sprinters, and joggers sometimes seek to gain an advantage by completely removing all hair from their entire body to reduce drag while competing.

===Baldness===
People experiencing hair loss may shave their heads in order to look more presentable, for convenience, or to adhere to a certain style or fashion movement. Those with alopecia areata or androgenetic alopecia often choose to shave their heads, which has rapidly become a common choice since the 1990s.

===Fictional===
In modern fiction, shaved heads are often associated with characters who display a stern and disciplined or hardcore attitude. Examples include characters played by Yul Brynner, Vin Diesel, Samuel L. Jackson, Telly Savalas, Sigourney Weaver, and Bruce Willis, as well as characters such as Agent 47 (whose physical appearance was based on his actor, the aforementioned David Bateson), Mr. Clean, Kratos, Saitama, and Walter White. Baldness is sometimes an important part of these characters&#x27; biographies; for example, Saitama wanted to be a superhero and lost all of his hair in exchange for receiving superpowers. Shaved heads are also often associated with villains in fiction, such as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Colonel Kurtz, Lex Luthor, Thanos, Bullseye, portrayed by Colin Farrell, and Alex Macqueen&#x27;s version of the Master. A notable exception is Daddy Warbucks.

A goatee, usually of the Van Dyke variety, is often worn to complement the look or add sophistication; this look was popularized in the 1990s by professional wrestler &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin. For most of the crime drama series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) wore a Van Dyke with a shaved head.

In futuristic settings, shaved heads are often associated with bland uniformity, especially in sterile settings such as&quot; V for Vendetta&quot; and &quot;THX 1138&quot;. In the 1927 sci-fi film &quot;Metropolis&quot;, hundreds of extras had their heads shaved to represent the oppressed masses of a future dystopia.

It is less common for female characters to have shaved heads, though some actresses have shaved their heads or used bald caps for roles.

==Modern subcultures==
===Skinheads===
In the 1960s, some British working-class youths developed the skinhead subculture, whose members were distinguished by short cropped hair (although they did not shave their heads down to the scalp at the time). This look was partly influenced by the Jamaican rude boy style. It was not until the skinhead revival in the late 1970s—with the appearance of punk-influenced Oi! skinheads—that many skinheads started shaving their hair right down to the scalp. Head shaving has also appeared in other youth-oriented subcultures such as the hardcore, black metal, metalcore, nu metal, hip hop, techno, and neo-nazi scenes.

===Sexuality and gender===
A sexual fetish involving head shaving is called Haircut Fetishism. While a shaved head on a man is often seen as a sign of authority and virility, a shaved head on a woman typically connotes androgyny, especially when combined with traditionally feminine signifiers. Drag queens have sometimes adopted shaved heads to express a genderqueer image. In the BDSM community, shaving a submissive or slave&#x27;s head is often used to demonstrate powerlessness or submission to the will of a dominant.

==Fundraising and support==
===Cancer===

Baldness is perhaps the most famous side effect of the chemotherapy treatment for cancer, and some people shave their heads before undergoing such treatment or after the hair loss starts to become apparent; some people chose to shave their heads in solidarity with cancer sufferers, especially as part of a fundraising effort.

===Covhead-19 Challenge===
During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many countries imposed strict lockdown procedures and actively encouraged members of the public to self-isolate. Many people, particularly men, began to shave their heads during lockdown due to boredom and/or being unable to have their hair cut as barbershops were forced to stay closed. In the UK, a fundraising effort began to support its National Health Service, which suffered from the enormous pressure of the pandemic. The effort was started on Just Giving with a goal of £100,000; it encouraged people to shave their heads whilst also donating money to the NHS and was dubbed the &quot;Covhead-19 Challenge&quot;. Various celebrities also took part.

<text>Lifestyle drug is an imprecise term commonly applied to medications which treat non–life-threatening and non-painful conditions such as baldness, wrinkles, erectile dysfunction, or acne, which the speaker perceives as either not medical problems at all or as minor medical conditions relative to others. It is sometimes intended as a pejorative, bearing the implication that the scarce medical research resources allocated to develop such drugs were spent frivolously when they could have been better spent researching cures for more serious medical conditions. Proponents, however, point out that improving the patient&#x27;s subjective quality of life has always been a primary concern of medicine, and argue that these drugs are doing just that. It finds broad use in both media and scholarly journals.

==Concept and impact on society==
There is direct impact of lifestyle drugs on society, particularly in the developing world. Implications associated with labeling of indications and products sales of these lifestyle drugs may be varied. Drugs can, over time, switch from &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; to &#x27;mainstream&#x27; use.

==Bioethics and medical policy debate==
Though no precise widely accepted definition or criteria are associated with the term, there is much debate within the fields of pharmacology and bioethics around the propriety of developing such drugs, particularly after the commercial debut of Viagra.

The German government&#x27;s health insurance scheme has denied insurance coverage for some &quot;Lifestyle-Medikament&quot; (&quot;lifestyle drugs&quot;) which they deem spurious.

Critics of pharmaceutical firms claim that pharmaceutical firms actively medicalize; that is, they invent novel disorders and diseases which were not recognized as such before their &quot;cures&quot; could be profitably marketed, in effect pathologizing what were widely regarded as normal conditions of human existence. The consequences are said to include generally greater worries about health, misallocation of limited medical research resources to comparatively minor conditions while many serious diseases remain uncured, and needless health care expenditure. This medicalization of some element of human condition has significance, in principle, as a matter for political discourse or dialogue in civil society concerning values or morals.

Social critics also question the propriety of devoting huge research budgets towards creating these drugs when far more dangerous diseases like cancer and AIDS remain uncured. It is sometimes claimed that lifestyle drugs amount to little more than medically sanctioned recreational drug use.

== Examples of lifestyle drugs ==

* Modafinil (when used off-label or for shift-work); Modafinil is indicated for the treatment shift-work sleep disorder, sometimes dubbed a lifestyle condition. In this aspect, modafinil is already recognized as a lifestyle drug by the FDA. Modafinil&#x27;s off-label use for increasing productivity is another example of its use as a lifestyle drug. Modafinil has been used to support lifestyles requiring long and irregular working hours (such as in shift-work), frequent memory recall throughout the day (amongst students and academics), and unfatigued decision making capabilities (such as amongst U.S. air force pilots, where modafinil is an approved &quot;go pill&quot;). Compared to other productivity drugs, users of modafinil for this purpose more often report possessing prescriptions for modafinil.
* Finasteride (when used to treat balding); The use of DHT blocking medications like finasteride for the treatment of balding without the intent to treat dangerous pathologies can be considered lifestyle-enhancing use of the medication. 
* Minoxidil; The use of minoxidil and other topical vasodilating medications for the treatment of balding without the intent to treat dangerous pathologies can be considered lifestyle-enhancing use of the medication.

<text>As a discipline, cultural analysis is based on using qualitative research methods of the arts, humanities, social sciences, in particular ethnography and anthropology, to collect data on cultural phenomena and to interpret cultural representations and practices; in an effort to gain new knowledge or understanding through analysis of that data and cultural processes. This is particularly useful for understanding and mapping trends, influences, effects, and affects within cultures.

==Themes==
There are four themes to sociological cultural analysis:

* Adaptation and change: this refers to how well a certain culture adapts to its surroundings by being used and developed. Some examples of this are foods, tools, home, surroundings, art, etc. that show how the given culture adapted. Also, this aspect aims to show how the given culture makes the environment more accommodating.

* How culture is used to survive; how the given culture helps its members survive the environment.

* Holism and specificity: the ability to put the observations into a single collection, and presenting it in a coherent manner.

* Expressions: this focuses on studying the expressions and performance of everyday culture.

==Cultural analysis in the humanities==
This developed at the intersection of cultural studies, history, comparative literature, art history, fine art, philosophy, literary theory, theology, anthropology, economy. It developed an interdisciplinary approach to the study of texts, images, films, and all related cultural practices. It offers an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of cultural representations and practices.

Cultural analysis is also a method for rethinking our relation to history because it makes visible the position of researcher, writer or student. The social and cultural present from which we look at past cultural practices—history— shapes the interpretations that are made of the past, while cultural analysis also reveals how the past shapes the present through the role of cultural memory for instance. Cultural analysis understands culture, therefore, as a constantly changing set of practices that are in dialogue with the past as it has been registered through texts, images, buildings, documents, stories, myths.

In addition to having a relation to disciplines also interested in cultures as what people do and say, believe and think, such as ethnography and anthropology, cultural analysis as a practice in the humanities considers the texts and images, the codes and behaviours, the beliefs and imaginings that you might study in literature, philosophy, art history. But cultural analysis does not confine the meanings to the disciplinary methods. It allows and requires dialogue across many ways of understanding what people have done and what people are doing through acts, discourses, practices, statements. Cultural analysis crosses the boundaries between disciplines but also between formal and informal cultural activities.

The major purpose of cultural analysis is to develop analytical tools for reading and understanding a wide range of cultural practices and forms, past and present.

<doc id="958916" wikidata="Q327149" url="?curid=958916" title="Dytiscidae">
<text>The Dytiscidae – based on the Greek &quot;dytikos&quot; (δυτικός), &quot;able to dive&quot; – are the predaceous diving beetles, a family of water beetles. They occur in virtually any freshwater habitat around the world, but a few species live among leaf litter. The adults of most are between long, though much variation is seen between species. The European &quot;Dytiscus latissimus&quot; and Brazilian &quot;Megadytes ducalis&quot; are the largest, reaching up to respectively. In contrast, the smallest is likely the Australian &quot;Limbodessus atypicali&quot; of subterranean waters, which only is about long. Most are dark brown, blackish, or dark olive in color with golden highlights in some subfamilies. The larvae are commonly known as water tigers due to their voracious appetite. They have short, but sharp mandibles and immediately upon biting, they deliver digestive enzymes into prey to suck their liquefied remains. The family includes more than 4,000 described species in numerous genera.

== Shape and morphology ==
Like most other water beetles, adult Dytiscidae have an oval habitus, often tapering toward the head with the pronotum widest at the base. Generally, it is smooth, flattened, and solid. The head, thorax, and abdomen are all streamlined; that is, they are integrated into a single, overall cohesive oval, as opposed to the three visibly articulate sections of some Carabidae like &quot;Brachinus&quot;. The elytra are so prominent that they conceal the abdominal sclerites.

Diving beetles across subfamilies have a set of six abdominal segments, or ventrites, visible on the belly. They are lined up roughly perpendicularly to the sagittal plane, one after the other. The segments can occupy much of the abdomen’s ventral side, from the anterior to the posterior. All the visible segments have different lengths in alignment with the oval shape’s curvature. Also an identifying feature of the belly is the prosternal process. It usually projects back to the mesocoxae in a spear shape. The tarsi have a tarsal formula of 5-5-5 and either one or two claws. Species with two claws have their mesoscutellum large and exposed. The claws are not toothed and can either be equal or unequal in size. The fore and middle tarsi have four segments, with the fourth sometimes very small and concealed between the third segment’s lobes. Generally, the legs’ front tibiae lack spines.

Unlike Noteridae and most Hydrophilidae, the dorsal surface is not more strongly convex than the ventral. Dytiscidae also differ from Noteridae in their mandibles, since they lack enlarged portions there of the molars. The antennae are glabrous and number up to 11 depending on the species. Dytiscid antennae are threadlike, generally longer than the head’s width, and look like their palps except longer, whereas hydrophilid and gyrinid antennae are clubbed. Their eyes are flat rather than protruding out, and, unlike Gyrinidae, are not divided. Unlike Carabidae, they do not have a transverse suture on their metasternum. They also lack the keel-like feature between the legs of many hydrophilids. All known diving beetles except ones in the genus Celina have the scutellum concealed, with only a minuscule part seen from the surface. This does not mean that the scutellum is invisible as in Noteridae.

Sex-wise, males have suction cup-like palettes on their legs to help them keep grip of females during copulation, and, in many species, females have furrows on their elytra and variously the pronotum and base of the head. In males, these parts are smooth. The furrows of the female make the elytral structure uneven, interfering with the male’s grip. They weaken it likely with the aim of increasing the female’s control over mating. Females are more selective when it comes to mating, seen in both sexually antagonistic morphology and behaviors. One behavior is a technique to break the male’s grip; when approached by males, some make fast and erratic swimming movements.

=== Size ===
The length of adults averages at 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4–1.0 in), and the elongate larvae range from 1 to 5 cm (0.39 to 1.97 in). The largest known adults are of the species &quot;Megadytes ducalis&quot;, at up to 4.75 cm (1.9 in), and &quot;Dytiscus latissimus&quot;, at up to 4.5 (1.8 in). At about 0.9 mm (0.035 in), meanwhile, &quot;Limbodessus atypicali&quot; is likely the smallest.

=== Color ===
Most are dark brown, blackish, or dark olive in color with golden highlights in some subfamilies.

== Swimming and water navigation ==
Diving beetles’ shape is optimized to ease navigation through water by reducing drag and improving stability while swimming. No segment moves or bends off balance due to being integrated with the others. This reduces form drag in two ways. One, it minimizes frontal resistance, which can upturn a swimmer with an uneven position. Two, it minimizes eddies, or waves, from eddy resistance that excessive, especially jerky, movement can incur. As they swim, diving beetles further streamline their bodies by tucking their four former legs into well-fitting grooves.

Like other water beetles, adult Dytiscidae get their oxygen while swimming by storing air in a space between their elytra and abdomen. At the same time, they can also diffuse dissolved oxygen from the water. The former ability keeps Dytiscidae alive underwater for about 30 minutes, whereas the two combined can give them around 24–36 hours’ worth of oxygen in one go. Some Dytiscidae have an additional way: using their elytra as a respiratory organ. One of them, &quot;Deronectes aubei&quot;, has been recorded to survive 6 weeks without atmospheric oxygen. &quot;Deronectes aubei&quot; and other smaller Hydroporinae have specialized setae on the elytra, pronotum, and ventral side that act as tracheal gills. The setae form a layer that keeps out water and traps air. Another feature acting as a gill in diving beetles is a small air bubble pressed out from the subelytral cavity and held by the hydrofuge hairs at the tip of the abdomen. The bubble shrinks over time, requiring the beetles to surface periodically due to gas exchange decreasing. This behavior of alternating between the surface and high depths is why they are known as diving beetles. Since larvae lack ventral gills, larvae instead have a siphon at the tip of the abdomen that they draw in air with.

Their two hind legs are much larger and wider than the other two pairs of legs so that they can use them as oars or paddles and move faster. The setae on the legs are there to help them change direction quickly while swimming. They can swim both forwards and in reverse effectively without needing to rotate. Unlike Hydrophilidae, their hind legs move in synchrony while swimming, namely during the forward and backward motions. The legs move asymmetrically while turning, in opposing directions, to steer the beetle sideways. Unlike other aquatic animals such as turtles, jellyfish, fish, and frogs, they both can stay in one direction while retreating and have a lower turning radius when they do turn. These strengths are a testament to their superior flexibility.

Diving beetles’ swimming process as a whole cycles between two actions: the power stroke and the recovery stroke. The power stroke’s function is to increase propulsion by means of maximizing the beetle’s cross-sectional area, which involves stretching the tibiae and tarsi and spreading out the setae. Because of the thrust that the hind legs give, the speed of each cycle peaks then, during a period of about 60% of the stroke. In the recovery stroke, the beetle then reduces the water resistance by rotating its tarsi 90° and folding the setae. Each cycle lasts for about 272 milliseconds, and the power stroke takes up about 47% of it. Most of the acceleration happens in the first 50 milliseconds. Likely for the purpose of escaping from predators, the acceleration is especially high when swimming backwards, with the increase in speed recorded to be from 0 to 27.3 cm/s. In 25 milliseconds, the average acceleration is 9.8 m/s2, whereas the average of the whole first 50 milliseconds of each forward swimming cycle is about 1.68 m/s2. The speed of the forward swimming cycle is on average about 8.74 cm/s, maximum 12.9 cm/s, and minimum 5.69 cm/s. The angular velocity of the turning cycle is on average about 8.3 rad/s, maximum 12.9 rad/s, and minimum 0.83 rad/s.

An ability specific to the smaller of the diving beetles is to rapidly blast ingested water out from the rectum. This is a solution to water surface tension impeding them from leaving the water to fly up away from it. On top of that, the rectal ampulla serves as a hydrostatic organ to regulate underwater buoyancy. To decrease buoyancy, diving beetles ingest water. To increase it, they expel water from their rectum like they do against surface tension.

== Chemical senses ==
The chemical senses of diving beetles, smell and taste, are strong. These senses provide for their need to identify potential food. Their taste receptors are concentrated on the maxillary and labial palpi, and they can detect sweet, sour, salty, and bitter chemicals. Then, the antennal surface is where the receptors for smell occupy. For males, this surface doubles as a way to locate female conspecifics ready to mate. Females have the ability to secrete olfactory pheromones attracting males within an area of 20–30 cm. This form of sexual signaling has been speculatively connected with the expanded antennomeres seen in the males of many groups in Dytiscidae.

Diving beetles are attracted to alarm pheromones emitted by fish that they eat as prey. In this way, the pheromones work against the fish as kairomones.

== Defense ==
From their pygidial gland, medium and large-sized species can secrete two types of substances: one a fluid and the other a paste-like solid. Oftentimes they go above water to groom themselves with their secretions, especially the paste, and distribute them on their body surfaces. They are an antimicrobial safeguard, protecting against bacteria and ciliates. Underwater, diving beetles apply them to sensitive body parts like spiraculi and subelytral tergal respiratory surfaces to protect them from water. Chemically, the secretion-grooming paste consists of benzoic acid, a glycoprotein, and some phenols, particularly methyl p-hydroxybenzoate and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Until the secretions are released, they stay in a reservoir within the pygidial gland. The reservoirs are covered with muscle layers so that the muscles can move them out when it is time. In conjunction with the pygidial glands are the prothoracic glands, another source of defensive secretions. The prothoracic glands’ reservoirs are not covered with muscle layers unlike the pygidial glands’. Instead, diving beetles use internal turgor pressure and contract their tergo-sternal muscles.  Once the secretions leave the reservoirs, they are discharged by way of one muscle that has its origin on the cervical membrane. Besides managing surface tension and buoyancy, the rectal ampulla is also a source of defense. When disturbed, diving beetle have the option to release odorous food residues from there to deter any organisms. Chemical defenses combat not only against parasites, but also predators. Steroids in the secretions can force a predator such as fish to regurgitate the beetle. A kind especially prevalent in diving beetles is pregnanes, such as 11-deoxycorticosterone. Experiments have shown pregnanes to possibly deter fish, protecting diving beetles from predation. Diving beetles are known to be the only family in the whole animal kingdom to produce certain kinds of steroids. For this reason, they are an important source for pharmaceutical R&amp;D. Chemicals in diving beetle secretions can also anesthetize or even kill predators. Other chemicals produced include a variety of aromatic esters, acids, and aldehydes.

Small species do not have chemical defenses, so instead opt to avoid danger by reducing their activity underwater or dispersing themselves when in groups. Diving beetles can also defend themselves by playing dead (thanatosis). Species hide, escape, and bite, as well. Larger species such as Cybistrinae and Dytiscinae kick with their hind legs.

== Habitat ==
Diving beetles are the most diverse beetles in the aquatic environment and can be found in almost every kind of freshwater habitat, from small rock pools to big lakes. Some dytiscid species are also found in brackish water. Diving beetles live in water bodies in various landscapes, including agricultural and urban landscapes. Some species, such as &quot;Agabus uliginosus&quot; and &quot;Acilius canaliculatus&quot;, are found to be relatively tolerant to recent urbanization. One of the most important limiting factors for diving beetle occurrence is the presence of fish, which predate on the beetles (mostly on larvae), compete for food, and change the structure of the habitat. The presence or absence of fish can also affect habitat use and habitat selection of dytiscids. Some species, such as &quot;Oreodytes sanmarkii&quot;, occur in exposed areas of waters, whereas many diving beetles species prefer habitats with aquatic plants, especially plants with complex structures, such as sedges and bulrush. Like other insects, their presence can be a good indicator of water quality. Oftentimes, surface color is a determiner of a diving beetle’s water environment. Having bright colors with markings is tied to clear waters with mineral substrates, and being melanin-high or green to habitats to dark substrates or dense vegetation. Some diving beetles live in areas in seasonal droughts. In these cases, they respond by either entering a terrestrial diapause or burrow into the stream substratum often down to 70–90 cm. The burrowing solution is likely the reason for their high survival rates following droughts. In addition, they can likely estivate over summertime dry spells.

A special stygobitic variety of dytiscids only live underground. Namely, these habitats are pitch-dark wells, boreholes, and caves. Most of them are in the subfamily Hydroporinae, however &quot;Exocelina abdita&quot; and &quot;Copelatus cessaina&quot; have been discovered as among the exceptions. Select Hydroporinae species live in terrestrial habitats, such as dry forest floor depressions, at least in the adult stage. Stygobitic species are prevalent in Western Australia because of the groundwater coming from its large network of paleodrainages. There, the beetles have been recorded to live in groundwater estuaries of salt lakes and shallow calcretes. Some species in &quot;Africophilus&quot;, &quot;Agabus&quot;, &quot;Fontidessus&quot;, &quot;Hydroporus&quot;, &quot;Hydrotrupes&quot;, and &quot;Platynectes&quot; are specialized for living in hygropetic habitats. Some, such as &quot;Hydroporus sardomontanus&quot;, are semi-hygropetric. Another less common environment type is interstitial or semi-subterranean habitats, such as gravel banks along rivers. Examples of interstitial species include &quot;Exocelina saltusholmesensis&quot;, &quot;Agabus paludosus&quot;, and &quot;Hydroporus bithynicus&quot;. Some of the stygobitic, interstitial, and terrestrial dytiscids have depigmentation and reduced or, in stygobitic species, none at all. Terrestrial species tend to also be smaller and have no setae on the mid and hind legs due to not swimming. Stygobitic species have fused elytra and an absence of wings. Interstitial species can have long sensory setae and reduced wings.

On land, the gait of many adult diving beetles appears awkward or clumsy due to their enlarged hind legs.

When they need to colonize a new habitat for mating or better conditions, they fly and look for light reflections from the water surface. In urban areas, diving beetles’ attraction to lights draws them erroneously to artificial lights and glossy surfaces on cars, etc.

== Diet ==
Similar to their wide range of habitats, Dytiscidae can be massive generalists diet-wise. Predaceous diving beetles’ diet can include both invertebrates and vertebrates. The larvae, especially, take on animals with the same or bigger size, such as fish and tadpoles. Adults readily eat both living animals and carrion, making them scavengers and water cleaners. In addition, diving beetles practice cannibalism, both within their species and outside it. Since they can feed on mosquito larvae, they have a potential role in biological control of mosquito populations similar to Hydrophilidae.

Larvae in many species do not eat prey through their mouth opening unlike larvae in other species and adults because it is closed. Instead they liquefy their food through their pincers and digestive protease enzymes and use a cibarial-pharyngeal sucking pump to ingest it. Meanwhile, adults bite and swallow whole small sections of their prey at a time.

== Larvae and development ==

When still in larval form, the beetles vary in size from about . The larval bodies are shaped like crescents, with the tail long and covered with thin hairs. Six legs protrude from along the thorax, which also sports the same thin hairs. The head is flat and square, with a pair of long, large, and pincer-like mandibles. It looks like a capsule due to its sclerotization. Larvae’s eyes are stemmata rather than compound eyes like the adults. During the first instar, larvae have two egg bursters on either side of the frontoclypeus. They use these to break out of their egg.

Along with the mandibles, the mouthpiece is also made up of a maxilla and a labium. The maxilla is further made up of a cardo, stipes, a palp of three palpomeres, and a palpiform galea. The labium has a postmentum on the base, prementum on the apex, and, attached to the prementum via a small palpiger, a pair of labial palps.

The dorsal surface is usually distinctly sclerotized, like the head, but not the ventral surface. There, sclerotized plates only appear sometimes on the most posterior segments, while the rest of the surface is mostly membranous. Sclerites’ pigmentation makes them often stand out from the rest of the body. The thorax has three segments, the pro-, meso-, and metathorax, whereas the subcylindrical abdomen has eight visible segments. Each of the thorax’s segments have a pair of articulated legs, a large tergite and, in most specimens, a pair of smaller laterotergites associated with each leg attachment. On the abdomen, the first 1-7 are relatively uniform in appearance while segment 8 is modified for respiration in varying ways. This last segment ends in a pair of urogomphi.

Some larvae are heavier than water, while others are buoyant and have to push to stay submerged underwater. The heavier larvae mostly move through creeping and burrowing and reach the surface by climbing or swimming.

When hunting, they cling to grasses or pieces of wood along the bottom, and hold perfectly still until prey passes by, then they lunge, trapping their prey between their front legs and biting down with their pincers. The larvae are also known to partially consume prey and discard the carcass if another potential prey swims nearby. Their usual prey includes tadpoles and glassworms, among other smaller water-dwelling creatures. As the larvae mature, they crawl from the water on the sturdy legs, and bury themselves in the mud for pupation. After about a week, or longer in some species, they emerge from the mud as adults. Adult diving beetles have been found to oviposit their eggs within frog spawn in highly ephemeral habitats, with their eggs hatching within 24 hours after the frogs and the larvae voraciously predating on the recently hatched tadpoles. Before pupating, larvae molt usually three times, correlating to their number of instars. If a flood occurs during pupation, there is a risk of drowning. Others deposit eggs in moist soil or debris by the shore, plant surfaces, or slits that they make in aquatic plant stems beneath the water. In the latter case, larvae in the first instar are usually attached to a plant and independent of surface air. For them, the plant serves as their substrate. The ability of adults to cut into plants with their ovipositor is unique to the genera &quot;Agabus&quot;, &quot;Coptotomus&quot;, &quot;Cybister&quot;, &quot;Dytiscus&quot;, &quot;Hydaticus&quot;, &quot;Ilybius&quot;, &quot;Laccophilus&quot;, and &quot;Thermonectus&quot;. This method could be superior to depositing the eggs in soil because plants typically stay moist much longer than surface soil does. In other cases, larvae diffuse oxygen throughout their body surface when underwater. The second and third instars take in surface air through a siphon at the abdomen’s tip.

Only one generation of diving beetles tends to be born every year (univoltine). Species of diving beetles can live up to around five or several years in total. Mating season for most species spans 2 to 3 months, most often within the time of spring and autumn, since adult diving beetles in many species overwinter. In habitats where the water bed stays unfrozen, they hibernate in plant material and sediments at the bottom. Different species can also overwinter as eggs and larvae.

==Uses==

=== Edibility ===
Adult Dytiscidae, particularly of the genus &quot;Cybister&quot;, are edible. Remnants of &quot;C. explanatus&quot; were found in prehistoric human coprolites in a Nevada cave, likely sourced from the Humboldt Sink. In Mexico, &quot;C. explanatus&quot; is eaten roasted and salted to accompany tacos. In Japan, &quot;C. japonicus&quot; has been used as food in certain regions such as Nagano prefecture. In the Guangdong Province of China, the latter species, as well as &quot;C. bengalensis&quot;, &quot;C. guerini&quot;, &quot;C. limbatus&quot;, &quot;C. sugillatus&quot;, &quot;C. tripunctatus&quot;, and probably also the well-known great diving beetle (&quot;D. marginalis&quot;) are bred for human consumption, though as they are cumbersome to raise due to their carnivorous habit and have a fairly bland (though apparently not offensive) taste and little meat, this is decreasing. Dytiscidae are reportedly also eaten in Taiwan, Thailand, and New Guinea.

=== As pets ===
Diving beetles can be kept in a water tank as pets.

==Diving beetle conservation==
The greatest threat to diving beetles is the degradation and disappearance of their habitats due to anthropogenic activities. For example, urbanisation has led to the decreasing quantity and quality of dytiscid habitats, which consequentially has increased the distance between habitats.; thus, dytiscids may be exposed to high predation risks during dispersal. Urbanisation has complex effects on the inter- and intraspecific variation in dytiscid traits. Some flight-related traits of &quot;Acilius canaliculatus&quot; and &quot;Hydaticus seminiger&quot;, such as body length and hindwing traits, were found to change along the urban gradient at different scales, whereas the traits of &quot;Ilybius ater&quot; exhibited no change. Brownification, which refers to the change in surface water colour towards yellow–brown hues caused by recent climate change and land-use change, can also drive changes in dytiscid communities. As some species, such as &quot;Dytiscus marginalis&quot;, are tolerant to brown water, whereas some species, &quot;Hyphydrus ovatus&quot;, tend to occur in clear water, brownification may threaten dytiscid species that are intolerant to highly coloured waters. Drainage can have adverse effects on their populations. For example, species such as &quot;Rhantus bistriatus&quot; and &quot;Graphoderus bilineatus&quot; went extinct in Britain likely because of the drainage of the Whittlesea Mere. Drainage affects dytiscids mostly due to disturbing their breeding cycles, as demonstrated through how dytiscid populations dramatically increased in East Asian paddy fields. Their flourishing started after rice producers switched from the conventional method of draining the land midseason while it is flooded, to no-till.

Dytiscid adults are eaten by many birds, mammals, reptiles, and other vertebrate predators, despite their arsenal of chemical defenses. But by far the most important predator of diving beetles are fish, which limit the occurrence of most diving beetle species to fishless ponds, or to margins of aquatic habitats. Although the larvae of a few dytiscid species may become apex predators in small ponds, their presence is also often incompatible with fish. Therefore, the main focus of water beetle conservation is the protection of natural, fish-less habitats.
In the European Union, two species of diving beetles are protected by the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, and thus serve as umbrella species for the protection of natural aquatic habitats: &quot;Dytiscus latissimus&quot; and &quot;Graphoderus bilineatus&quot;.

==Cultural significance==
The diving beetle plays a role in a Cherokee creation story. According to the narrative, upon finding nowhere to rest in the &quot;liquid chaos&quot; the beetle brought up soft mud from the bottom. This mud then spread out to form all of the land on Earth.

==Ethnobiology==
Adult Dytiscidae, as well as Gyrinidae, are collected by young girls in East Africa. It is believed that inducing the beetles to bite the nipples will stimulate breast growth. The effect of that habit has not been tested, but it is notable that the pygidial and prothoracic defense glands of diving beetles contain many types of bioactive steroids. The steroids that are operative include estrone, estradiol and testosterone. In Uganda, girls do not use Dytiscidae, but only the smaller Gyrinidae, since it is believed that the Gyrinidae are the females and the Dytiscidae are the males of the same species. Beetles in these two families are known as “yewha inat” (mother of water; Amharic የውሃ እናት) in Tanzania and rural regions of Ethiopia. For the opposite effect, young boys in Tanzania’s Njombe Region use the same technique. They do so to mitigate the breast growth that can temporarily arise during the period of puberty before testosterone levels go up. Meanwhile, in other areas of East Africa such as Zimbabwe, diving beetles are an aid for boys learning to whistle. In this case, the beetle bites the tongue.

==Parasites==
Dytiscidae are parasitised by various mites. Those in genera &quot;Dytiscacarus&quot; and &quot;Eylais&quot; live beneath the elytra of their hosts, those in genus &quot;Acherontacarus&quot; attach to the mesosternal regions and those in genus &quot;Hydrachna&quot; attach to various locations. These mites are parasitic as larvae with the exception of &quot;Dytiscacarus&quot;, which are parasitic for their entire life cycle.

<text>Tall Tale (also known as Tall Tale: The Unbelievable Adventures of Pecos Bill) is a 1995 American Western adventure fantasy film directed by Jeremiah Chechik, written by Steven L. Bloom and Robert Rodat, produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Caravan Pictures and starring Scott Glenn, Oliver Platt, Nick Stahl, Stephen Lang, Roger Aaron Brown, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, and Patrick Swayze. It tells the story of a young farm boy who receives aid from tall tale figures in saving his town from a greedy developer.

Though shooting of the film was completed in 1993, it did not get a theatrical release until March 1995. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office failure, grossing only $8.2 million on an estimated $32 million budget.

==Plot==
In 1905, Daniel Hackett, a young farm boy from the western town of Paradise Valley, is unhappy with his life and dreams of life in New York City. His father Jonas likes to tell Daniel tall tales about Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan and John Henry, which Daniel has heard many times, leading him to doubt their existence.

Meanwhile, Paradise Valley is being coveted by a greedy developer, J.P. Stiles. Stiles attempts to convince Jonas and the other farmers to sell their land to him with Jonas&#x27; farm lying in the center of where he wants to develop. However, when Jonas refuses to hand up his deed, Stiles hunts him down and shoots him, but not before Jonas hands the deed off to Daniel for safe keeping.

With Jonas in critical condition and unable to farm, his land is put at risk. Upset, Daniel runs out to hide in his father&#x27;s boat and cries himself to sleep. The ropes holding the boat come undone and Daniel drifts downstream.

When Daniel awakes, he discovers that the boat had washed up in the deserts of Texas. After a brief encounter with some thieves, Daniel is rescued by legendary cowboy Pecos Bill. The duo later team up with lumberjack Paul Bunyan, and strong African-American ex-slave John Henry. Each of these heroes hooks up with Daniel. He even uses Babe the Blue Ox to free them after they were arrested for causing a bar fight by Pecos&#x27; ex-girlfriend Calamity Jane. Afterwards, the heroes soon become involved in an increasingly bitter and boisterous fight against Stiles&#x27; men as Stiles plans to buy up land threaten the very strength of the folk heroes and the well-being of the common people.

When Stiles catches up with to Daniel with his men having subdued Pecos, Paul, and John, he entices Daniel to give up the deed by filling him with doubts about the heroes. Daniel then sees a vision of the Paradise Valley inhabitants being forced to help with Stiles&#x27; development. Just then, Daniel wakes up in the boat realizing it was just a dream with the ropes having not come undone. He ventures towards Stiles&#x27; train who was about to head out into the lands.

Daniel confronts Stiles, the railroad magnate, and Stiles&#x27; henchmen as they attempt to run him over, until John arrives and holds the train. Stiles orders his men to kill them, but Pecos arrives and shoots off their trigger fingers, and the townsfolk join in to help, while Paul, who went inside while nobody noticed, cuts down the mine poles. Daniel then finishes off the last pole, killing Stiles and his men in the resulting cave-in and the crowd cheers for him.

Daniel then returns to the farm and admits to his recuperated dad that the stories were true and their land is important. Paul, Babe, John, his mule Cold Molasses, and Pecos show up to say goodbye to Daniel. As Paul and John disappear with their animals, Pecos leaves his horse Widow-Maker to Daniel and twirls his lasso at a twister for his departure as Jonas witnesses it.

==Cast==
==Production==
Caravan Pictures optioned the spec script for &quot;Tall Tale&quot; by the two writers Steven L. Bloom and Robert Rodat for $200,000 with a reported purchase price of $650,000-$750,000 in March 1993. Producer Joe Roth then offered the script to director Jeremiah S. Chechik who accepted as he was intrigued by the underlying themes of &quot;the end&quot; of the Old West with the advent of industrialization, and likened the film to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in how it played to adults as well as children.

In August 1993, Patrick Swayze and Scott Glenn both joined the film.

Principal photography began on September 12, 1993. Filming locations included the California sites of Disney Ranch and Melody Ranch in Santa Clarita, Fillmore, and Barstow, as well as Vasquez Rocks State Park near Agua Dulce. Other locations included Roaring Fork Valley in Colorado, Utah&#x27;s Monument Valley and San Juan River, and Lake Powell and Glen Canyon in Arizona. Filming was completed two months later on December 16.

==Release==
===Marketing===
A promotional tie-in for the film was arranged with Subway.

===Box office===
&quot;Tall Tale&quot; was released in theaters on March 24, 1995. The film flopped domestically and worldwide, and did not make back its $32,000,000 budget. It made $3,046,181 in its opening weekend in the United States, ranking fifth at the US box office, behind other openers &quot;Major Payne&quot; and &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;. It eventually grossed $8,247,627 in the United States and Canada. The film had more success in the home video market.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Tall Tale&quot; has a 48% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.9/10 based on 21 reviews. The critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Tall Tale&quot; draws on American folk legends for a family-friendly adventure with disappointingly little appeal&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Ed Hulse of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B+, writing: &quot;The exquisitely photographed landscapes pull you out of your living room and into the grandeur of the West&quot;. Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a 3 out of 4 stars and described it as &quot;a warm-blooded, high-spirited family adventure film&quot;.

Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; also gave a positive review, stating the &quot;pic is impressively larger than life, both in physical scale and heroic action. And while the pacing could be brisker during its slightly flabby midsection, it works its way up to a dandy crowd-pleasing climax&quot;. Leydon praised Swayze&#x27;s performance as Pecos Bill and said Glenn &quot;makes a splendidly wicked villain&quot;. Leydon also admitted the film might have a hard time finding an audience because kids may not be as familiar with the stories of Pecos Bill, John Henry, and Paul Bunyan.

In a negative review, Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Mickey&#x27;s minions herein transform three of America&#x27;s rootin&#x27;est, tootin&#x27;est frontier superheroes into politically and ecologically corrected pablum-spewing icons for our time. Aimed at kids more attuned to the niceties of the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, this action adventure portrays the first of the forest-levelers, Paul Bunyan (Oliver Platt), as a benign Brobdingnagian tree-hugger&quot;.

== Home media ==
Disney released &quot;Tall Tale&quot; on VHS on August 15, 1995 from Walt Disney Home Video. It is also released DVD on August 26, 2008. It is also included on Disney&#x27;s streaming service, Disney+.

<doc id="958928" wikidata="Q1606461" url="?curid=958928" title="Henry B. González">
<text>Henry Barbosa González (born Enrique Barbosa González; May 3, 1916 – November 28, 2000) was an American Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Texas, who represented Texas&#x27;s 20th congressional district from 1961 to 1999. He is the longest serving Hispanic in Congress and a founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

==Early life==

González was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Mexican-born parents Genoveva (née Barbosa) and Leonides Gonzalez (from Mapimí, Durango), who had immigrated during the Mexican Revolution. After he received an associate&#x27;s degree from San Antonio College, he earned his undergraduate credentials from the University of Texas at Austin. Later, he received a Juris Doctor from St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law, also in San Antonio. Upon graduation, he became a probation officer, and was quickly promoted to the chief office of Bexar County, Texas. In 1945, he quit after a judge refused to allow him to add an African-American probation officer to his staff. In 1950, he was scoutmaster of Troop 90 in San Antonio, of which his son was a member.

==Career in local and state politics==
González served on the San Antonio City Council from 1953 to 1956. As a city councilmember, González helped desegregate swimming pools and other public accommodations in San Antonio.

In 1956, he defeated Republican candidate Jesse Oppenheimer for a seat in the Texas Senate. In 1960, he defeated another Republican, Ika &quot;Ike&quot; Simpson Kampmann, Jr. (1918-2006), to hold his state Senate seat. He remained in the Senate until 1961 and set the filibuster record in the chamber at the time by speaking for thirty-six straight hours against a set of bills on segregation. Most of the bills were abandoned (eight out of ten).

He ran for governor in 1958 and finished second in the Democratic primary (the real contest for governor in what was then a solidly Democratic state) to Price Daniel. In May 1961, González ran in the special election for the Senate seat that Lyndon B. Johnson vacated to become U.S. Vice President. He finished in sixth place in part because he split the liberal and Hispanic vote with Maury Maverick, Jr., of San Antonio.

==House of Representatives==

In September 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Rep. Paul J. Kilday of Texas&#x27;s 20th congressional district to the Court of Military Appeals. González entered the special election for the San Antonio-based district in November 1961 and defeated a strong Republican candidate, attorney John W. Goode, whom former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower flew to San Antonio to endorse. Mexican film star Cantinflas appeared with Vice President Johnson at shopping centers and supermarkets in San Antonio to support González, who would never face another contest nearly that close. He was unopposed for a full term in 1962 and was reelected seventeen times thereafter. He never faced truly serious or well-funded opposition, having been unopposed in 1970, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1982, and 1984. In fact, the 20th district was (and remains) so heavily Democratic that González faced Republican opposition only five times and handily prevailed whenever challenged.

González became known for his staunchly liberal views. In 1963, Republican U.S. Representative Ed Foreman called González a &quot;communist&quot; and a &quot;pinko&quot; and González confronted him. González was again referred to as a &quot;communist&quot; in 1986 by a man at Earl Abel&#x27;s restaurant, a popular San Antonio eatery. The 70-year-old representative responded by punching him in the face. González was acquitted of assault for this incident when the restaurant patron dropped the charge.

Unlike many southern politicians at the time, González vocally supported civil rights proposals. He voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

González was in President Kennedy&#x27;s fateful motorcade through Dallas on November 22, 1963. He recalled rolling down the window as his car neared the Texas School Book Depository, then hearing three distinct shots during the assassination. González&#x27;s car proceeded to Parkland Memorial Hospital where, upon seeing a blood-soaked bouquet of roses in the rear of the presidential limousine, he initially believed Jackie Kennedy had been shot. There, he saw Lyndon Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, Mrs. Kennedy, and President Kennedy&#x27;s sheet covered body. González helped place Kennedy&#x27;s casket in the hearse that transported Kennedy to Air Force One.

Reported to be unsettled by the effect that the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. had on the nation, González pushed in 1975 for a House committee study. In 1976, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was created to investigate the deaths of President Kennedy and King, and González succeeded Thomas N. Downing as its chairman in January 1977. After a power struggle with the HSCA&#x27;s counsel, he resigned as the committee&#x27;s chairman that same year. Shortly before González chaired the HSCA, Robert P. Gemberling, head of the FBI&#x27;s investigation of the Kennedy assassination for thirteen years after the release of the Warren Commission&#x27;s report, said González, as well as Downing, had &quot;preconceived conspiracy theories&quot;. According to a 1992 report, González did not rule out the possibility of shots other than the three he heard were fired from a silencer.

Following the United States invasion of Grenada in 1983, González suggested the impeachment of President Ronald Reagan, and he introduced articles of impeachment related to the Iran–Contra scandal and sent them to the House Judiciary Committee in 1987. No further action was taken on said articles. González later called for the impeachment of President George H. W. Bush for not obtaining Congressional approval before the 1991 Gulf War. Early in the presidency of Bill Clinton, González also blocked hearings into the Whitewater controversy until finally agreeing to hold hearings in 1994. González was an outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve System, and proposed an audit and introduced bills to impeach Paul Volcker and other Governors of the Federal Reserve.

==Retirement==

In 1997, González fell ill and was unable to return to the House for over a year. Finally, he decided not to run for a 19th full term in 1998. He died in a San Antonio hospital on November 28, 2000.

He had long groomed his son, Charlie, to succeed him. Charlie Gonzalez won easily in 1998 and served through January 2013; between them, father and son served 52 consecutive years in Congress.

==Legacy==

<doc id="958941" wikidata="Q7965004" url="?curid=958941" title="Walter Greenwood">
<text>Walter Greenwood (17 December 1903 – 13 September 1974) was an English novelist, best known for the socially influential novel &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; (1933).

== Early life ==
Greenwood was born at 56 Ellor Street, his father&#x27;s house and hairdresser&#x27;s shop in &quot;Hanky Park&quot;, Pendleton, Salford, Lancashire. His father, Tom, died when he was nine years old, and his mother, Elizabeth Matilda, provided for him by working as a waitress. Greenwood&#x27;s parents belonged to the radical working classes; his mother came from a family with a strong tradition of socialism and union membership, and she inherited her father’s book-case complete with its socialist book collection.

Greenwood was educated at the local council school and left at the age of 13. While the normal school leaving age at the time was 14, he was able to leave a year early after taking the Board of Education Labour Exam, which was only &#x27;open to fatherless boys&#x27; so that they could go to work to help support their family. His first job was as a pawnbroker&#x27;s clerk. A succession of low paid jobs followed, while he continued to educate himself at the Salford Public Library. During periods of unemployment Greenwood worked for the local Labour Party, briefly becoming a councillor, and began to write short stories, after no longer qualifying for the dole, exhausting his entitlement under the rules of the time. In October 1929, after being owed three months wages from his last job as a typist, he took home the office typewriter in lieu of his wages, and began to write the stories of the people of Hanky Park, to earn a living.

==&quot;Love on the Dole&quot;==

While unemployed, during 1932, Greenwood wrote his first novel, &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;, about the destructive social effects of poverty in his home town. After several rejections, it was published during 1933. It was a critical and commercial success, and a great influence on the British public&#x27;s opinion of unemployment. The novel even prompted parliament to investigate, resulting in reforms. 
In 1935, Greenwood collaborated with Ronald Gow on a stage adaptation of the novel. The critic of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote: Being conceived in suffering and written in blood, it profoundly moves its audience in January 1935 ... it has the supreme virtue in a piece of this kind of saying what it has to say in plain narrative, stripped of oration.
The play had successful runs in both Britain and the United States, which meant that Greenwood would not have to worry about employment again.

A film adaptation was proposed in 1936, but the British Board of Film censors made strong objections to the possibility of a film about industrial unrest which might be socially divisive. In 1940, however, when unemployment could be presented as a thing of the past, a film adaptation was permitted. The film, which toned down some of the novel&#x27;s social commentary, was directed by John Baxter, and featured Deborah Kerr. It was successful with the critics and at the box office.

==Greenpark Productions==

During the Second World War, Greenwood served with the Royal Army Service Corps. Just before the war, in 1938, he had set up Greenpark Productions Ltd, a documentary film production company that made government information films for the Ministry of Information (which became the Central Office of Information from 1946). Originally based in Polperro, Cornwall, the company relocated to London in 1939. After the war it expanded into making upmarket corporate films. Amongst its roster of directors were Ken Annakin, Ralph Keene and Humphrey Swingler, brother of the poet Randall Swingler. Greenpark Productions was a founding member of the Film Producers Guild, which set new standards for UK documentary film production. The company, together with its film archive, was acquired in 1977 by firm producer David Morphet.

== Personal life and death ==
In the 1930s, Greenwood was engaged to Alice Myles, a Salford girl, and stayed in Salford for a while, where he served as a city councillor, but soon relocated to London. He abandoned his fiancée, who sued him successfully for breach of promise.

Greenwood stood twice as a Labour Party candidate for Salford City Council; he won on his second attempt, in November 1934, securing a seat in the St. Matthias&#x27;s Ward. Greenwood won with 1,848 votes, a majority of 750 over the sitting independent councillor, A.C. Dixon, and the Communist candidate, R Davies, polled only 81 votes. Greenwood&#x27;s experience of being a Labour councillor was the inspiration for his book, &quot;His Worship the Mayor&quot;.

During 1937 he married Pearl Alice Osgood, an American actress and dancer; they divorced in 1944. Greenwood later described them as having been a pair of &#x27;erupting volcanoes&#x27;. He retired to Douglas, Isle of Man, in the 1950s, and died there on 13 September 1974, aged 70.

Greenwood&#x27;s manuscripts and letters are archived in the University of Salford&#x27;s Walter Greenwood Collection.

<doc id="958942" wikidata="Q8044505" url="?curid=958942" title="Xinbeitou branch line">
<text>The Taipei Metro Xinbeitou branch line (formerly transliterated as Hsin Peitou branch line until 2003) is an elevated, light rail branch line of the Tamsui–Xinyi line. It first opened for service on 28 March 1997. The line is long and consists of two stations.

== History ==
=== Heavy rail line ===
The Xinbeitou branch line traces back to a heavy rail line built by the Japan&#x27;s rule over Taiwan. A spur from the pre-metro Tamsui line, the line&#x27;s name was transliterated as the &quot;Shinhokutō Line&quot; in Japanese and &quot;Hsin Peitou Line&quot; in Chinese. Completed on 1 April 1916, the line was built specifically to transport visitors from the city to the newly-developed &quot;onsen&quot; facilities around Xinbeitou. The line was closed at the end of 1944 during World War II. After a change in power to the Kuomintang, the Xinbeitou branch line was reopened to passengers in 1946.

The line was served by single-car DR2100–DR2400 series diesel carriages that made round trips between Beitou and Xinbeitou stations. As Taipei&#x27;s population grew, the branch transitioned from a touristic line to a commuter line, and was heavily used before its closure in 1988 for the reconstruction of the Beitou line into a rapid transit line (Tamsui–Xinyi line). Before the line&#x27;s closure, the line was served by twenty-nine round trip services per day; each trip took around 90 seconds and cost . The daily ridership was around 22,000 passengers.

=== Metro line ===
Originally, the Xinbeitou branch line was to close permanently after the Tamsui line was converted into a rapid transit line. Xinbeitou residents successfully petitioned to the government for a branch line, arguing that it was an important transportation link for commuters. The branch line&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony was held on 30 December 1988, and on 28 March 1997, the new rapid transit line re-opened for service as part of the Taipei Metro. According to the original design, trains leaving downtown Taipei would terminate at either Xinbeitou or station. Before the line&#x27;s opening, Taipei Metro decided against this plan due to insufficient rolling stock.

=== Noise complaints ===
Since the line&#x27;s opening, residents along the line have complained about noise from the trains due to the sharp curvature of the tracks and its close distance to apartment buildings on the sides. Rail grinding and the installation of noise barriers did not alleviate the noise by much. Shortly after opening, the train&#x27;s frequency was reduced, the operating hours were shortened to 7 am and 9 pm, and the number of cars on each train was reduced from six to three.

On 14 September 2007, Taipei Metro extended its operating hours to between 6 am and midnight. It was hoped that if the noise standards were deemed to be at an acceptable level that the current Orange line trains on the Red line could operate on the Xinbeitou Line instead. Trains operate at a maximum headway of one per 7–8 minutes during peak hours.

It has been reported that the line is operating at a loss. A proposal was put forth in 2005 that a low-speed maglev train similar to the Linimo in Japan would solve the problem of noise pollution, but its feasibility on operating costs became a subject of ridicule.

In July 2019, the soundproofing walls on the line were updated as part of newly-introduced through-operations to central Taipei.

== Rolling stock ==

A modified C301 (trainset 013/014) originally operated on the line in a 3-car formation, making it unique on the system. From 2007 onwards, the train was replaced by a purpose-built C371 of a similar length.

<text>Elektronika, also spelt Electronika and Electronica (, &quot;Electronics&quot;), is the brand name used for many different electronic products built by factories belonging to the Soviet Ministry of Electronic Industry, including calculators, electronic watches, portable games, and radios. Many Elektronika designs were the result of efforts by Soviet engineers, who were working for the Soviet military–industrial complex but were challenged with producing consumer goods that were in great shortage in the Soviet Union. The brand is still in use in Belarus.

== Calculators ==
Most notable is a line of calculators, which started production in 1968. The Elektronika calculators were produced in a variety of sizes and function sets, ranging from large, bulky four-function calculators to smaller models designed for use in schools operating on a special, safer 42V standard (like the MK-SCH-2). As time progressed, Elektronika calculators were produced that supported more advanced calculations, with some of the most recent models even offering full programmability and functionality similar to today&#x27;s American-designed graphing calculators.

The Elektronika brand is now used by Novosibirsk RPN programmable calculators Elektronika MK-152 (:ru:Электроника МК-152) and Elektronika MK-161 (:ru:Электроника МК-161).

== Computers ==
The following Elektronika computers used a Soviet Intel-compatible CPU:
* MS 1502, MS 1504 – XT clone
* KR-series (01/02/03/04) – mass production of popular Russian 8-bit homebrew RK-86 (:ru:Радио 86РК).

The following Elektronika computers used a Soviet CPU, compatible with PDP-11:
* Elektronika 60
* UKNC
* DVK – clone of SM EVM, stripped for mass production to satisfy general scientific and R&amp;D needs.
* BK-0010 and BK-0011M – stripped and low-cost version of DVK, targeted at teenagers and home users.

== Electronic games &amp; toys ==
Most Elektronika-branded electronic toys were Nintendo Game &amp; Watch clones. These used the KB1013VK1-2 microprocessor, a Soviet clone of the Sharp SM-5A used in Game &amp; Watch consoles.

The vast majority of the Elektronika electronic toys had model names that start with IM (ИМ &quot;Игра Микропроцессорная&quot;, a Russian acronym for &quot;&quot;microprocessor based game&quot;).

Some model names for Elektronika branded clones start with IE (ИЭ &quot;Игра Электронная&quot;, a Russian acronym for &quot;electronic game&quot;&quot;).

The Elektronika electronic toys that had model names beginning with MG were manufactured by Angstrem and were designed for export with English packaging and inserts.

The known models include:
* IM-01 Chess computer (1986) – designed and manufactured by Svetlana.
* IM-01T Chess computer (1992) – improved version of the IM-01, designed and manufactured by Svetlana.
* IM-02 Well, Just You Wait! (1984) – Nintendo EG-26 &quot;Egg&quot;, a variation of &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; without the Disney license.

<text>The Mil Mi-2 (NATO reporting name [[Hoplite]]) is a small, three rotor blade Soviet-designed multi-purpose helicopter developed by the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant, designed in the early 1960s and produced exclusively by WSK &quot;PZL-Świdnik&quot; in Poland. Nearly 5,500 were made by the time production stopped in 1999, and it remains in service globally.

==Design and development==

The Mi-2 was produced exclusively in Poland, in the WSK PZL-Świdnik factory in Świdnik.

The first production helicopter in the Soviet Union was the Mil Mi-1, modelled along the lines of the S-51 and Bristol Sycamore and flown by Mikhail Mil&#x27;s bureau in September 1948. During the 1950s it became evident, and confirmed by American and French development, that helicopters could be greatly improved with turbine engines. S. P. Isotov developed the GTD-350 engine and Mil used two of these in the far superior Mi-2.

The twin shaft-turbine engines used in the Mi-2 develop 40% more power than the Mi-1&#x27;s piston engines, for barely half the engine weight, with the result that the payload was more than doubled. The Mi-2 fuselage was extensively altered from its predecessor, with the engines mounted overhead. However, the external dimensions remained similar.

The Mil-built prototype first flew in the Soviet Union on 22 September 1961, after the initial development the project was transferred to Poland in 1964. The first Świdnik-built example flew on 4 November 1965; this was the only Soviet-designed helicopter to be built solely outside the Soviet Union. PZL-Świdnik produced a total of 5,497 helicopters, about a third for military users. The factory also developed fiberglass rotor blades, and developed the wide-body Mi-2M seating 10 passengers instead of eight. Most typical role-change kits include four stretchers for air ambulance usage, or aerospraying or cropdusting applications.

In Poland, several specialized military variants were also developed in early 1970s for support or training roles, with 23 mm autocannon, machine guns and/or two 57 mm rocket pods, four 9K11 Malyutka anti-tank missiles or Strela-2 AA missiles.

==Operational history==

The Mi-2 was first introduced into the Soviet Air Force in 1965. The Mi-2 is used by mainly former Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries, although it was also purchased by the armed forces of Mexico and Myanmar.

Most of the armed Mi-2 variants were used by Poland. Some were also used by the former East Germany (with 7.62 mm machine gun and 57 mm unguided rocket armament only).

North Korea still maintains a large active fleet of Mi-2s.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces were recorded capturing three Mi-2 helicopters in Kherson International Airport.

The helicopter is also used to spray agricultural chemicals by private owners in Ukraine. Two people were killed in a crash in 2021 near Zaive, in the region of Mykolaiv. Another two people died in a crash of Kharkiv Air Force University (203rd Training Aviation Brigade) Mi-2 crash on 1.9.2024. 

On 26 October 2024, a medical Mi-2 helicopter crashed in Kirov region in Russia, killing all four aboard, including a pilot, a doctor, and two paramedics.

<text>Thomas Saltus Lubbock (November 29, 1817 – January 9, 1862) was a figure in Texas and the Confederacy. Born in South Carolina, he relocated to Texas and became a Texas Ranger, fighting in the Texas Revolution. Lubbock later served as a lieutenant in the failed Texan Santa Fe Expedition. During the Civil War, he rose to the rank of colonel in the Confederate Army and commanded Terry&#x27;s Texas Rangers for a brief period before his death in 1862. Lubbock County, Texas, and the city of Lubbock are named in his honor.

==Biography==
Lubbock was born in Charleston, South Carolina, son of Henry Thomas William Lubbock and Susan Ann (née Saltus). His brother was Governor of Texas Francis R. Lubbock. In 1835, he moved to Louisiana and worked as a cotton factor in New Orleans. When the Texas Revolution started, he marched to Nacogdoches, Texas, with Capt. William G. Cooke&#x27;s company and participated in the siege of San Antonio de Bexar. Thereafter, he took employment on a steamboat on the upper Brazos River.

After working for a time with Samuel May Williams and Thomas F. McKinney, Lubbock joined the Texan Santa Fe Expedition as a lieutenant of one of the military companies. His men and he were captured in New Mexico and confined in Santiago Convent, Mexico City. Lubbock escaped by jumping from the convent&#x27;s balcony and made his way back to Texas. After Adrián Woll seized San Antonio in 1842, Lubbock was elected first lieutenant of Gardiner N. O. Smith&#x27;s company, and due to Smith&#x27;s illness, marched at the head of the company to Bexar to join in driving the Mexicans back across the Rio Grande. Lubbock and his men were among the Texans who followed Alexander Somervell back to Texas on December 19, 1842, after declining to join William S. Fisher on the Mier Expedition.

Lubbock was a strong secessionist, characterized as a &quot;very worthy and zealous&quot; Knight of the Golden Circle. At the beginning of the American Civil War, he accompanied Benjamin Franklin Terry, John A. Wharton, Thomas J. Goree, and James Longstreet (who was to become the commander of I Corps of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia) from Galveston, Texas, to Richmond, Virginia.

At the Confederate capital on June 22 or June 23, 1861, Terry and he, seconded by Senator Louis T. Wigfall, Thomas Neville Waul, Wharton, and Longstreet, petitioned Confederate President Jefferson Davis for &quot;authority to raise a company or battalion of guerrillas.&quot; &quot;I must have your men,&quot; Davis reportedly replied.

While in Virginia, Lubbock, Terry, and some 15 other Texans organized themselves into an independent band of rangers to scout for the Confederate Army. Early in July, Lubbock and Terry, at the head of a company of Virginia cavalry, charged a Union camp, captured two of the enemy, wounded a third, and captured a horse and a Sharps rifle. Only then did they realize that they were alone and that the Virginians had not followed them in their rash attack.

Lubbock was still a civilian in Virginia at the time of the battle of First Bull Run; he &quot;exposed his life in bearing messages during the contest.&quot; With Terry, who had also served as a volunteer aide on the battlefield, Lubbock was authorized to raise a regiment of cavalry to serve in the Confederate States Army. The two men returned to Texas and recruited the Eighth Texas Cavalry, more commonly known as &quot;Terry&#x27;s Texas Rangers&quot;. Terry served as the regimental colonel and Lubbock as lieutenant colonel. In poor health, Lubbock left the regiment at Nashville, Tennessee, and never returned to it.

==Personal life==
Lubbock was married on December 14, 1843, to Sara Anna Smith.

==Death and legacy==
Colonel Terry was killed at the Battle of Rowlett&#x27;s Station (also known as the Battle of Woodsonville), in Kentucky on December 17, 1861. On January 8, 1862, Lubbock, then sick in bed in a Bowling Green hospital with typhoid fever, was promoted to colonel and advanced to command of the regiment. He died the next day. Thomas Saltus Lubbock is buried in Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas). The city of Lubbock located in western Texas, and the county of which it is the seat, are named after Tom S. Lubbock. Terry County Texas is named after Terry&#x27;s Texas Rangers.

<text>Restitution and unjust enrichment is the field of law relating to gains-based recovery. In contrast with damages (the law of compensation), restitution is a claim or remedy requiring a defendant to give up benefits wrongfully obtained. Liability for restitution is primarily governed by the &quot;principle of unjust enrichment&quot;: A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution.

This principle derives from late Roman law, as stated in the Latin maxim attributed to Sextus Pomponius, &quot;Jure naturae aequum est neminem cum alterius detrimentum et injuria fieri locupletiorem&quot; (&quot;By natural law it is just that no one should be enriched by another&#x27;s loss or injury&quot;). In civil law systems, it is also referred to as enrichment without cause or unjustified enrichment.

In pre-modern English common law, restitutionary claims were often brought in an action for &quot;assumpsit&quot; and later in a claim for money had and received. The seminal case giving a general theory for when restitution would be available is Lord Mansfield&#x27;s decision in &quot;Moses v Macferlan&quot; (1760), which imported into the common law notions of conscience from English chancery. Blackstone&#x27;s Commentaries also endorsed this approach, citing &quot;Moses&quot;.

Where an individual is unjustly enriched, modern common law imposes an obligation upon the recipient to make restitution, subject to defences such as change of position and the protection of bona fide purchasers from contrary equitable title. Liability for an unjust enrichment arises irrespective of wrongdoing on the part of the recipient, though it may affect available remedies. And restitution can also be ordered for wrongs (also called &quot;waiver of tort&quot; because election of remedies historically occurred when first filing a suit). This may be treated as a distinct basis for restitution, or it may be treated as a subset of unjust enrichment.

Unjust enrichment is not to be confused with illicit enrichment, which is a legal concept referring to the enjoyment of an amount of wealth by a person that is not justified by reference to their lawful income.

==History==

=== Roman law ===
In civil law systems, unjust enrichment is often referred to as &quot;unjustified&quot; enrichment. Its historical foundation of enrichment without cause can be traced back to the Corpus Iuris Civilis. While the concept of enrichment without cause was unknown in classical Roman law, Roman legal compilers eventually enunciated the principle of unjustified enrichment based on two actions of the classical Roman period—the &quot;condictio&quot; and the &quot;actio de in rem verso&quot;.

The &quot;condictio&quot; authorized recovery by the plaintiff of a certain object or money in the hands of the defendant. The defendant was considered a borrower who was charged with returning the object or money. For the &quot;actio de in rem verso&quot;, the plaintiff bore the burden of specifying the cause for his demand, namely, demanding the restitution of assets that had exited the plaintiff&#x27;s patrimony and entered the defendant’s patrimony through the acts of the defendant’s servants.

The coherent concept of unjustified enrichment then appeared in the Justinian Code, based on Roman pragmatism with equitable considerations and moral principles of Greek philosophy. In the Justinian Code, &quot;condictiones&quot; were grouped into categories, such as when the plaintiff had given a thing or money:

# in contemplation of a future result that did not follow;
# for a reason disapproved by law or repugnant to public policy;
# by mistake because payment was not actually due; or
# without a good reason for the transaction.

Further, the &quot;actio de in rem verso&quot; gradually expanded to cover instances in which third parties were enriched at the expense of the impoverished obligee, and &quot;unjustified enrichment&quot; was recognized as a source of obligations under the heading of &quot;quasi-contract&quot;.

=== Civil law ===

For the School of Salamanca members, like Tomás de Mercado, the prohibition of unjustified enrichment finds directly his source in natural law, which doesn&#x27;t allow a privileged party, and in the principle of commutative justice. Thus it manages apply to the entire law on propriety and contract. It had, for example, a strong influence on the reflexions regarding contracts of prostitution.

The interpretations of Roman law principles on unjustified enrichment, by the French jurist Jean Domat and the German jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny, formed the respective origins of the modern French and German law on unjustified enrichment. Domat developed the French unjustified enrichment principles based on the &quot;actio de in rem verso&quot;, as well as a modified version of the Roman concept of &quot;causa&quot; (cause), which renders contracts actionable even when they are not normally recognized under Roman law. In contrast, the concept of unjustified enrichment is considerably broader and more frequently invoked in Germany and Greece to address issues of restitution as well as restoration for failed juridical acts. Equitable tracing is a particularly well suited remedial tool.

=== Common law ===

&quot;See also&quot;: English unjust enrichment law

In systems of law derived from the English common law, the historical core of the law of unjust enrichment lies in quasi-contract. These were common law (as distinct from equitable) claims giving rise to a personal liability to pay the money value of a benefit received from another. Legal scholars from Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard at the turn of the 20th century began to rationalise these disparate actions into a coherent body of law. The principle said to underlie these actions was eventually recognized as unjust enrichment. Subsequent scholarship has sought to expand the explanatory power of the principle of unjust enrichment and it is now often said (albeit not without controversy) to encompass both common law and equitable claims.

==Framework==

Cases of unjust (or unjustified) enrichment can be examined in the following way:

* Was the defendant &quot;enriched&quot;?
* Was the enrichment &quot;at the expense of the claimant&quot;?
* Was the enrichment &quot;unjust&quot;?
* Does the defendant have a &quot;defense&quot;?
* What &quot;remedies&quot; are available to the claimant?
These questions are a familiar part of the modern English law of unjust enrichment, having been popularised by the writing of Professor Peter Birks and expressly endorsed by English courts. The framework provides a useful taxonomical function in Australian law, though, the concept of unjust enrichment has been subject to inconsistent treatment by Australian courts, as discussed below. Stated at this level of abstraction, the framework is a useful grounding for comparative study between common law and civil law jurisdictions.

===The meaning of &quot;unjust&quot;: unjust factors vs. absence of basis===

Generally speaking, the mere receipt of a benefit from another is unobjectionable and does not attract legal consequences. The exception is where such receipt is &quot;unjust&quot; or &quot;unjustified&quot;. Both civil and common law legal systems have bodies of law providing remedies to reverse such enrichment.

A conceptual split, albeit one not necessarily coextensive with the common law - civil distinction, is between systems based on an &quot;unjust factor&quot; approach and systems based on an &quot;absence of basis&quot; approach.
* Common law systems such as those of England, Australia, Canada and the United States typically adopt the &quot;unjust factor&quot; approach. In this analysis, the claimant must point to a positive reason why the defendant&#x27;s enrichment is unjust. Examples of &quot;unjust factors&quot; that ground a claim for restitution include: mistakes of fact or law; total failure of consideration, duress, undue influence, and the &quot;Woolwich&quot; ground.
* Civil law systems such as those of France and Germany typically adopt an &quot;absence of basis&quot; approach. On this analysis, the defendant is obliged to make restitution if there is no &quot;basis&quot; for his receipt: for example, because the contract under which the defendant received the benefit was void &quot;ab initio&quot;. Some common law systems have shown signs of a possible shift towards this approach. 
In most cases, the conceptual approach does not affect the outcome of a case. For example, suppose that A makes an oral contract with B under which A will pay $100 for certain services to be provided by B. Further suppose that A pays the money but B discovers that, pursuant to legislation, contracts for such services are void unless in writing. B refuses to perform. Can A recover his payment? On both approaches, B is unjustly enriched at A&#x27;s expense. On the &quot;absence of basis&quot; approach, B&#x27;s enrichment has no legitimate explanatory basis because the contract was void. On the &quot;unjust factor&quot; approach, there has been a total failure of considerationthat is, A has received no part of the bargained-for counter-performance; restitution follows automatically from the fact of invalidity.

===Remedies for unjust enrichment: personal and proprietary restitution===

The remedy for unjust enrichment is restitution: the restoration of what was conferred to the claimant. In short, the correcting of the injustice that occurred when the claimant suffered a subtraction of wealth and the defendant received a corresponding benefit. Restitution can take the form of a personal or a proprietary remedy.

Where a personal remedy is awarded, the defendant is ordered to pay the money value of the benefit received. This personal money award is the typical form of restitution ordered.

Where a proprietary remedy is awarded, the court recognises (or declares) that the defendant has a beneficial or security interest in specific property of the defendant. Whether proprietary remedies can be awarded depends on the jurisdiction in question. 
* In English law, the orthodox view is that unjust enrichment generally triggers personal, rather than proprietary remedies. This is because the law of quasi-contract only generate personal money awards: either a liquidated debt (as in actions for money had and received or money paid) or a sum assessed by a civil jury or the court itself (as in quantum meruit or quantum valebat). Scholars seeking to expand the explanatory power of unjust enrichment have argued that other areas of the law such as subrogation and claims to traceable substitutes form part of the law of unjust enrichment. This view has been accepted, though its implications remain unclear. 
* In Australian law, actions derived from the common money counts continue to generate only personal remedies. The doctrinal basis of subrogation is not unsettled: it has nothing to do with unjust enrichment. Claims to traceable substitutes are a part of the law of property, not unjust enrichment.

== Restitution for wrongs ==
Imagine that A commits a wrong against B and B sues in respect of that wrong. A will certainly be liable to pay compensation to B. If B seeks compensation then the court award will be measured by reference to the loss that B has suffered as a result of A&#x27;s wrongful act. However, in certain circumstances it will be open to B to seek restitution rather than compensation. It will be in B&#x27;s interest to do so if the profit that A made by his wrongful act is greater than the loss suffered by B. Or in some circumstances, the lost good &quot;G&quot; carries more value to B than the actual cost of &quot;G&quot;. For example, suppose B possesses a rare book from the 14th century (G), which cost only Rs 10 in that period. A has illegally stolen G (from B) and has destroyed it. Currently very few samples of G exist in the world, yet since its demand is not much, G still costs Rs 10. Since very few samples exist in the world, it is near impossible to find a person from whom G could be bought. In such a circumstance, B is entitled to get Rs 10 from A under the law of torts. However, B might prefer to apply law of restitution instead (waiver of torts), and claim that he needs a copy of G rather than Rs 10.

Whether or not a claimant can seek restitution for a wrong depends to a large extent on the particular wrong in question. For example, in English law, restitution for breach of fiduciary duty is widely available but restitution for breach of contract is fairly exceptional. The wrong could be of any one of the following types:

* A statutory tort
* A common law tort
* An equitable wrong 
* A breach of contract
* Criminal offences

Note that 15 are all &quot;causative events&quot; (see above). The law responds to each of them by imposing an obligation to pay compensatory damages. Restitution for wrongs is the subject which deals with the issue of when exactly the law also responds by imposing an obligation to make restitution.

;Example
In &quot;Attorney General v Blake&quot;, an English court found itself faced with the following claim. The defendant had made a profit somewhere in the region of £60,000 as a direct result of breaching his contract with the claimant. The claimant was undoubtedly entitled to claim compensatory damages but had suffered little or no identifiable loss. It therefore decided to seek restitution for the wrong of breach of contract. The claimant won the case and the defendant was ordered to pay over his profits to the claimant. However, the court was careful to point out that the normal legal response to a breach of contract is to award compensation. An order to make restitution was said to be available only in exceptional circumstances.

==National systems==
=== Australia ===
Whether there is a distinct body of law in Australia known as the law of unjust enrichment is a highly controversial question. In &quot;Pavey &amp; Mathews v Paul&quot; (1987) 162 CLR 221 the concept of unjust enrichment was expressly endorsed by the High Court of Australia. This was subsequently followed in numerous first instance and appellate decisions, as well as by the High Court itself.

Considerable skepticism about the utility of the concept of unjust enrichment has been expressed in recent years. The equitable basis for the action for money had and received has instead been emphasised and in &quot;Australian Financial v Hills&quot; [2014 HCA 14] the plurality held that the concept of unjust enrichment was effectively &#x27;inconsistent&#x27; with the law of restitution as it had developed in Australia. It is worth noting that the analytic framework had been expressly endorsed by the High Court just two years before in &quot;Equuscorp v Haxton&quot; [2012 HCA 7]. For the moment, the concept of unjust enrichment appears to serve only a taxonomical function.

===Belgium===
The reception of unjust enrichment into Belgian law has been upheld multiple times by the Court of Cassation, which has ruled that unjust enrichment is a general principle of law. The Court has stated that the legal basis for unjust enrichment is equity (&quot;ius aequum&quot;).

According to the Court, five elements constitute unjust enrichment:
#an enrichment;
#an impoverishment;
#a connection between the enrichment and the impoverishment;
#an absence of a basis (&quot;sine causa&quot;) of the enrichment;
#a person alleging unjust enrichment may not simultaneously do so for benevolent intervention (&quot;negotiorum gestio&quot;) or undue payment (&quot;solutio indebiti&quot;).

===Canada===
The doctrine of unjust enrichment was definitively established as a fully fledged course of action in Canada in Pettkus v. Becker, 1980 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1980 2 SCR 834] 

To establish unjust enrichment, the Plaintiff needs to show: (i) enrichment; (ii) deprivation; (iii) causal connection between enrichment and deprivation; and (iv) absence of juristic justification for the enrichment.

The concept of deprivation and enrichment are extremely broad. Deprivation refers to any loss of money or money&#x27;s worth in the form of contribution while A is enriched if B contributes to the acquisition of assets in A&#x27;s name. The causal connection between enrichment and deprivation must be &quot;substantial and direct&quot;. The absence of juristic reason is satisfied if a Plaintiff establishes a reason why the benefit ought not be retained, or if the Defendant demonstrates a convincing argument in favour of retention of the property. Remedy for unjust enrichment is frequently an imposition of constructive trust over the property unjustly retained.

===United Kingdom===

The law of unjust enrichment in England rapidly developed during the second half of the 20th century. It has been heavily influenced by the writings of jurists from Oxford and Cambridge. England adopts the &quot;unjust factor&quot; approach.

In Scotland, the law developed in a piecemeal fashion through the twentieth century, culminating in three pivotal cases in the late 1990s. The most crucial of these was &quot;Shilliday v Smith&quot;, in which Lord Roger essentially laid the bedrock for what is now considered modern Scots unjustified enrichment law, bringing together the fragmented law into one framework, drawing from the principles of Roman Law upon which Scots Law as a whole is based (note the term &quot;unjustified&quot; is preferred to &quot;unjust&quot; in Scotland). Unjustified enrichment is more established as a fundamental part of the Scots law of obligations than unjust enrichment is in English law.

=== United States ===

The &quot;Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment&quot; (2011) (“R3RUE”) states that unjust enrichment is a body of legal obligations under the common law and equity – but separate from tort and contract law – that is available to take away an enrichment that lacks an adequate legal basis. A claim of restitution for unjust enrichment “results from a transaction that the law treats as ineffective to work a conclusive alteration in ownership rights.”

The Third Restatement and its predecessor, the &quot;Restatement on Restitution&quot; (1937), advocate for treating restitution as a unified and cohesive body of law, rather than a muddled variety of miscellaneous legal and equitable claims, remedies, and doctrines such as quantum meruit, quantum valebant, account of profits, quasi-contract, constructive trust, money had and received, and so forth.

Because the common law is mostly governed by state law, especially after &quot;Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins&quot; (1938), restitution is mostly determined by the law of each state and territory. However, it can also be a remedy under federal law. Also in 1938, the enactment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure merged procedures for law and equity and replaced the common-law forms of action with a single civil action. This has, to some extent, blurred differences between legal and equitable restitution, and obscured awareness of legal restitution&#x27;s origin in the action of assumpsit.

==== Federal case law ====

One early case in the Supreme Court, &quot;Bingham v. Cabot&quot; (1795), was a suit at law for money had and received, quantum meruit, and quantum valebant (three &quot;common counts&quot; for legal restitution). (The decision focused on other questions, including whether the case should have been brought in admiralty and whether in deciding a writ of error the court could take notice of certain facts.)

In &quot;Bright v. Boyd&quot;, 4 F. Cas. 127, 132-34 (C.C.D. Maine 1841), Justice Joseph Story, a prominent early American jurist (and author of influential treatises on equity), held that recovery was available in equity for mistaken improvements to land (i.e., when the person improving the land later learns that he did not own the land), citing the Latin maxim against enrichment at another&#x27;s detriment.

Federal patent and copyright law has long allowed recovery for either damages or profits. In &quot;Livingston v. Woodworth&quot;, 56 U.S. 546 (1854), the Supreme Court held that a patent-owner could sue in equity for an infringer’s profits, saying that the ill-gotten profits belonged “&quot;ex aequo et bono&quot;” to the owner of the patent. Later, recovery for either damages or profits was codified in statute. The Supreme Court identified recovery of profits under the Copyright Act as a form of equitable relief for “unjust enrichment” in &quot;Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.&quot; (1940).

In &quot;Trustees v. Greenough&quot; 105 U.S. 527 (1881), the Supreme Court held that, in a representative suit in equity (later known as a class action), a representative plaintiff who recovers a &quot;common fund&quot; for the benefit of all represented plaintiffs (absent class members) may recover attorney fees from the fund, preventing enrichment of the absent plaintiffs at the expense of the representative plaintiff. This is an exception to the &quot;American rule&quot; that litigants must pay their own attorney fees (absent statutory exceptions). In &quot;Central Railroad &amp; Banking Co. of Georgia v. Pettus&quot; (1885), the court held that the representative plaintiff could not, however, recover a salary for the time spent litigating. 

Restitution is available in equity to recover money previously paid to satisfy a court judgment that is later reversed, as the Supreme Court held in &quot;Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida&quot;, 295 U.S. 301 (1935). However, the Court therefore noted that equitable defenses are available where it would not be fair to require the money to be returned.

In &quot;Mobil Oil Exploration &amp; Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United States&quot;, 530 US 604 (2000), the Supreme Court ruled that, in a contract with the United States (one of few areas where federal contract law applies), repudiation is grounds for restitution, even if the contract was repudiated by a statute. (Congress had blocked Mobil&#x27;s offshore oil lease, so the United States had to return the money paid for the lease.)

In &quot;Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company v. Knudson&quot;, 534 U.S. 204 (2002), the Supreme Court noted that legal restitution and equitable restitution are not historically identical, and so it held that legal restitution is not covered by a provision of ERISA authorizing only equitable relief.

In &quot;Kansas v. Nebraska&quot;, 574 U.S. 445 (2015), the Supreme Court ordered restitution by Nebraska as an equitable remedy for breach of an interstate water-sharing agreement with Kansas. The majority cited the Third Restatement to support the availability of restitution for “opportunistic breach” of contract.

In &quot;Liu v. Securities and Exchange Commission&quot; (2020), the Supreme Court held that restitution (usually called “disgorgement” in U.S. securities law) is available for violations of federal securities law because the SEC is authorized to seek “equitable relief” under 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(5).

In &quot;AMG Capital Management, LLC v. FTC&quot; (2021), the Supreme Court held that statutory authority for the Federal Trade Commission to sue for an “injunction” does not authorize suit for restitution. The court unanimously held that the statutory language refers to prospective equitable relief, and does not include retrospective monetary relief.

In &quot;Pearson v. Target Corp.&quot;, 968 F.3d 827 (7th Cir. 2020), the Seventh Circuit held that equitable restitution is available for a practice known as &quot;objector blackmail,&quot; where objectors to a class action settlement drop their objections on behalf of the class in return for a private payment in excess of the rest of the class.

In &quot;Williams Electronics Games, Inc. v. Garrity&quot;, 366 F.3d 569 (7th Cir. 2004), Judge Richard Posner held that restitution for wrongs is generally &quot;available in any intentional-tort case in which the tortfeasor has made a profit that exceeds the victim&#x27;s damages.&quot; (The Third Restatement puts further qualifications, including that restitution for wrongs is not available where an injunction to prevent the tort would have been inequitable.)

<text>The first USS &quot;Israel&quot; (DD-98) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and the years following.

==Namesake==
Joseph Israel was born c. 1780. He entered the Navy as Midshipman on 15 January 1801. He served on during the Quasi-War with France and on , and during the First Barbary War. Midshipman Israel was killed 4 September 1804 when ketch exploded in the harbor of Tripoli during the night effort to destroy the enemy shipping led by Lieutenant Richard Somers.

A monument to the memory of Israel and his fellow officers and men stands on the grounds of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Israel was reported to be of the Jewish faith, although &quot;there was no evidence that Israel is a Jew or of Jewish ancestry.&quot;

==History==
&quot;Israel&quot; was launched on 22 June 1918 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts, sponsored by Miss Dorothy Brown. The destroyer was commissioned on 13 September 1918.

Following shakedown out of Boston, &quot;Israel&quot; rendezvoused with the battleship at Newport, Rhode Island on 24 September 1918, and performed escort duty on the East Coast as a unit of the Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. She departed New York on 13 October with a convoy, and arrived at Gibraltar on 6 November, via the Azores and Port Leixoes, Portugal. Having escorted the Brazilian Detachment to Gibraltar Harbour on 9 November, &quot;Israel&quot; arrived at Venice on 18 November and joined the Eastern Mediterranean Forces. On 1 April 1919, she was in Spalato, now Split, with and . She operated out of Venice and Split as a station ship transporting supplies and personnel until 12 July 1919 when she departed Villefranche, France, via Gibraltar and the Azores, arriving at Boston on 24 July.

While undergoing at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, &quot;Israel&quot; was fitted out as a light minelayer and her classification changed 17 July 1920 to DM-3.

Sailing from Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 4 March 1921, &quot;Israel&quot; cruised along the East Coast until 5 July when she joined Mine Squadron 1, Atlantic Fleet, at Gloucester, Massachusetts. During the remainder of the year she engaged in mining practice and exercises on the East Coast; and from January to April 1922, participated in fleet exercises based at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Culebra, Puerto Rico.

&quot;Israel&quot; arrived in Philadelphia 15 May 1922 and decommissioned there 7 July. Remaining inactive during the following years, she was reduced to a hulk in 1936 in accordance with the London Treaty. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 25 January 1937, and she was sold to the Union Shipbuilding Company, Baltimore, Maryland for scrap on 18 April 1939.

<doc id="958974" wikidata="Q1424754" url="?curid=958974" title="Henry Bonilla">
<text>Henry Bonilla (born January 2, 1954) is an American politician and former congressman who represented Texas&#x27;s 23rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He was defeated in his bid for re-election by Ciro Rodriguez, a former Democratic member of Congress, in a special election runoff held on December 12, 2006. His term expired January 3, 2007 when the 110th Congress officially began.

==Roots in San Antonio==
Bonilla was born in San Antonio, the son of Anita Arellano and Enrique A. Bonilla. When he was young he joined a TRIO Educational Talent Search program, which provides academic support and college awareness activities to students. He graduated from South San Antonio High School in 1972 and received his Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1976. Before entering politics, he was a television news executive at San Antonio&#x27;s CBS affiliate, KENS-TV. His former wife, Deborah Knapp (born December 1, 1954), continues as an anchor at the station. He has since married the former Sheryl White Shelby (born 1959).

==Congressional career==
In March 1992, Bonilla won the 23rd district&#x27;s Republican nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives (map). The 23rd had been a Democratic district since its creation in 1967, but Bonilla charged four-term incumbent Albert G. Bustamante with neglecting his constituents&#x27; needs, being involved in the House banking scandal by writing 30 &quot;cheques calientes&quot; in the House Bank, and taking excessive and questionable junkets abroad.

Bonilla was inadvertently assisted by the state legislature, which left a heavily Republican area of western San Antonio in the 23rd while carving the new 28th District out of much of the 23rd&#x27;s territory. Despite being outspent by $758,453 to $594,032 and being in a district that Bill Clinton carried the same year, Bonilla won by a huge 21-point margin, 59 to 38 percent, the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent that year.

In March 1999, Governor George W. Bush named Bonilla as the only Texan on his presidential exploratory committee. Bonilla often represented Bush on national news programs and as a surrogate speaker. Although the 23rd had a slight Democratic lean, Bonilla developed a very conservative voting record. Largely because of his popularity in San Antonio, he did not face a credible challenge until 2002, when Democrat Henry Cuellar, a former Texas secretary of state, came within two points of unseating him.

Bonilla announced that he would probably run in 2006 for the United States Senate seat held by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison if she ran for governor in 2006 against the incumbent Republican Rick Perry. However, Hutchison decided to run for another term in the Senate.

==American Dream PAC==
When Bonilla took charge in 1999 of an independent political fund called American Dream PAC, he made clear that its mission was to &quot;give significant, direct financial assistance to first-rate minority GOP candidates&quot;. However, between 1999 and the end of 2003, only $48,750 (or 8.9 percent) of the $547,000 the PAC has received, has gone to minority office-seekers, while more than $100,000 has been routed to Republican Party organizations or causes.

Bonilla defends his PAC&#x27;s record of assisting minority candidates, saying, &quot;We did the best we could.&quot; In all, 27 minority office-seekers, predominantly Hispanic-American, received money, mostly small donations. But Bonilla said it was sometimes difficult to find &quot;good, solid minority candidates to expend the funds on&quot;. In July 2003, the treasurer of the PAC pleaded guilty to embezzling $119,021 between 1999 and 2003 and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. The thefts were not discovered until almost four years after they began. &quot;It was a black mark on my judgment&quot;, Bonilla said in a 2004 interview.

==2003 redistricting==
Bonilla was priming for a rematch against Cuellar in 2004, but in 2003, a controversial mid-decade redistricting by the Texas legislature, the results of efforts by U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, moved most of Laredo, which had been one of the cores of the 23rd since its formation, to the 28th district. In its place, Bonilla received several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs that had previously been in the nearby 21st district, all but assuring him of a seventh term. Meanwhile, Cuellar entered and won the 2004 primary against the 28th district incumbent Democrat Ciro Rodriguez and then went on to win the general election.

Bonilla contributed money from his American Dream PAC to the redistricting effort.

Soon after the 2004 elections, Bonilla was criticized when he proposed a procedural rule change that would permit House leaders to retain their leadership positions despite having been indicted by a state grand jury.

The proposal would have allowed Tom DeLay to remain as Majority Leader despite having been indicted by the Travis County district attorney&#x27;s office for possible campaign finance violations. Many constituents believed that Bonilla was blatantly repaying a political favor to DeLay for having favorably redrawn the 23rd District.

On June 29, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Anthony Kennedy taking the lead, ruled in &quot;League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry&quot; that Bonilla&#x27;s district violated the Civil Rights Act, although the justices upheld most of the 2003 redistricting. The Court declared that the Texas legislature violated the rights of Latino voters when it cut most of Laredo out of the 23rd. Although the reconfigured 23rd was still 55 percent Latino, only 46 percent of the district&#x27;s voting-age population was Latino.

The justices held that as a result, the new district didn&#x27;t have enough Latinos to pass muster under the Voting Rights Act. Since the legislature hadn&#x27;t created an acceptable majority-Latino district (its intended replacement, the Austin-to-McAllen 25th district, was not considered compact enough), the reconfigured 23rd had to be struck down as well. Because of the size of the 23rd, the ruling effectively forced the redrawing of nearly every district from El Paso to San Antonio. Precedent dictated that a new map had to be issued before the November elections.

The court issued the new lines on August 7. It moved all of Laredo out of the 23rd and into the 28th, but nevertheless made the district much friendlier to Democrats by boosting its Latino population to 65 percent. In particular, Bonilla lost many of the strongly Republican areas he had inherited in the 2003 redistricting. At the same time, he picked up much of heavily Democratic south San Antonio.

Bonilla had grown up in this area, which had been part of the 23rd from 1967 to 1993. The court ordered an all-party primary on Election Day, with a December runoff if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote. The new map included Rodriguez&#x27; home and much of his former base, and he announced that he would run against Bonilla in November. Federal Election Commission records show Bonilla paid the Los Angeles-based law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins $100,000 in 2006, from his campaign funds, to argue that the district boundaries were constitutional. In February, the firm filed an &quot;amicus&quot; brief before the Supreme Court in support of the redistricting plan.

==Defeat in 2006==
On November 7, Bonilla faced six Democrats, including Ciro Rodriguez and Vietnam War veteran Rick Bolanos in the all-candidate special election required by the court decision on redistricting (see above). The ballot also included one independent. Bolanos had won the Democratic primary earlier in the year.

In the first special election, Bonilla won 48 percent of the vote to Rodriguez&#x27;s 20 percent. Since no one gained a majority, there was a runoff between the two former colleagues. Rodriguez won the runoff with 54% of the vote to Bonilla&#x27;s 46%. Bonilla was the first Republican incumbent in Texas to be unseated by a Democrat in 10 years, since Nick Lampson&#x27;s defeat of Steve Stockman in a 1996 runoff election. Lampson was also returned to Congress in 2006 after being defeated for reelection in 2004, like Rodriguez in another district. Bonilla said in interviews the night of his defeat that his loss was in part a result of the changed districting. He ran controversial commercials that claimed that Rodriguez took funds from terrorists, which media outlets called &quot;bold claims&quot;. He later apologized to the press for any of those who took offense, but stood by his statement.

However, a large number of Hispanics and Latinos, who predominantly reside in District 23, had expressed disdain for Bonilla by stating that he had fallen out of touch with the needs and concerns of minorities. His reputation even earned him the nickname &quot;Henry Vanilla&quot;, as some Hispanics claimed that Bonilla no longer could relate to his culture. In a year of war, illegal immigration issues, and a proposed border fence, Latinos left the Republicans side in droves.

==Failed nomination as ambassador==
After his term in Congress expired, Bonilla was nominated to be Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the Organization of American States, with the rank of Ambassador.

After two months with no action by the Senate, Bonilla asked U.S. President George W. Bush to withdraw his nomination. Following the withdrawal of his ambassador nomination, Bonilla joined the Washington-based firm The Normandy Group.

==Consideration for Trump Cabinet==
In December 2016, Bonilla and two other Texas Republicans, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and Miller&#x27;s predecessor in that office, Susan Combs, were interviewed for the position of United States Secretary of Agriculture in the first Trump administration.

<doc id="958980" wikidata="Q1361399" url="?curid=958980" title="Car tailfin">
<text>The tailfin era of automobile styling encompassed the 1950s and 1960s, peaking between 1955 and 1961. It was a style that spread worldwide, as car designers picked up styling trends from the US automobile industry, where it was regarded as the &quot;golden age&quot; of American auto design and American exceptionalism.

General Motors design chief Harley Earl is often credited for the automobile tailfin, introducing small fins on the 1948 Cadillac, but according to many sources the actual inventor/designer of the tailfin for the 1948 Cadillac was Franklin Quick Hershey, who at the time the 1948 Cadillac was being designed was chief of the GM Special Car Design Studio. It was Hershey who, after seeing an early production model of a P-38 at Selfridge Air Base, thought the twin rudders of the airplane would make a sleek design addition to the rear of future modern automobiles. Tailfins took particular hold on the automotive buying public&#x27;s imagination as a result of Chrysler designer Virgil Exner’s Forward Look, which subsequently resulted in manufacturers scrambling to install larger and larger tailfins onto new models. As jet-powered aircraft, rockets, and space flight gained public recognition through the Space Race, the automotive tailfin assemblies (including tail lights) were designed to resemble more and more the tailfin and engine sections of contemporary jet fighters and space rockets.

Plymouth claimed that the tailfins were not fins, but &quot;stabilizers&quot; to place the &quot;center of pressure&quot; as far to the rear as possible and thus &quot;reduce by 20% the needs for steering correction in a cross wind&quot;, while Mercedes-Benz called its own tailfins , sight lines that ostensibly aided in backing up.

==Background==
Automobile engineer Paul Jaray added a center fin to his prototype designs in the 1920s for aerodynamic stability. Influenced by his patents some car producers made streamlined prototypes with one center positioned tailfin. For example, the Audi F5 Stromliner prototype, Kdf-Wagen prototype, Tatra T77 production car or Fiat Padovan prototype.
Some sub-models of the 1937 Cadillac Fleetwood, which predates the P-38, also contained hints of tailfins via projecting tail-light &quot;paddles&quot;, although it is unclear if this influenced later fin designs. The 1941 Cadillac Series 63 4-Door Sedan also had a form of jutting tail-lights, although milder than the 1937 Fleetwood. Even though the 1948 model was the first conscious effort at fins, the earlier partial occurrences may have made the concept more acceptable to consumers and designers. (World War II produced a gap of Cadillac model production between the early 1940s and late 1940s as factories turned to military goods production, interrupting the development of the fin concept.)

==Tailfin era==
The Cadillac 1948 fin styling proved popular, and its use spread to other models in the General Motors family of brands. Soon it was adopted by other manufacturers, with top Chrysler stylist Virgil Exner in particular taking the tailfin look on board. As confidence grew in the styling trend, the fins grew larger and bolder.

The most extreme tailfins appeared in the late 1950s, such as on the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado and the 1959 Imperial Crown sedan. The 1959 Cadillac fins looked like jet airplane vertical stabilizers with sharp points and twin bullet-shaped taillights. Many of automotive press and much of the public were getting weary of the exaggerated tailfins, and the manufacturers were ready to phase them out because they added cost and complexity to design and manufacturing. Tailfins descended throughout the early 1960s, even adopting a downward slope on the 1965 Cadillacs. Mostly they disappeared and were replaced with a new style of taillight, called lobster-claw taillights, although in instances a sharp-edged quarter panel meeting a downward sloping trunk created the illusion of fins. Vestigial tailfins, however, remained on American cars into the 1990s, at least as far as the 1999 Cadillac Deville.

Mercedes-Benz introduced a modest tailfin on its 1959 W111 series of sedans, which gained the nickname &quot;Fintails&quot;. In company terminology, they were , sight lines that aid backing up. In 1997, Lancia introduced the Lancia Kappa Coupé with similar rear &quot;sight line&quot; augmentation.

==Safety issues==


Tailfins have been criticized as a safety concern, even as a parked vehicle. In &quot;Kahn v. Chrysler&quot; (1963), a seven-year-old child on a bicycle collided with a fin and sustained a head injury. A case of the same era, &quot;Hatch v. Ford&quot; (1958), is also prominent in the study of personal injury from parked vehicles. In both of these cases, children were injured by sharp protrusions on parked cars. The plaintiffs lost in both cases. In &quot;Kahn&quot;, the court found that Chrysler was not responsible for anticipating &quot;all the possible ways in which a person may injure himself by falling against an automobile.&quot; In &quot;Hatch&quot;, the plaintiff attempted to rely on a law governing the size and protrusion of radiator caps and grills, which the court said did not apply to tailfins.

==Subtle reintroduction into car styling ==
In 1999 Cadillac launched the Cadillac Evoq concept to lead the marque&#x27;s new design language, known as &quot;Art and Science&quot;. Recent Cadillacs have continued the tradition of the brand&#x27;s signature vertical taillamp tailfins. Cadillac&#x27;s designers call the current Cadillacs&#x27;s styling evocative of tailfins. In 2010, the Cadillac SRX styling incorporated the trademark vertical taillights sculpted into tiny tailfins projecting from the rear. This was also done with the Cadillac XTS, which launched in 2012, and with many other models in later years.

The 2000-2005 Buick LeSabre&#x27;s rear styling included subtle delta fins as a homage to the early LeSabres.

In 2009 Trabant introduced the Nt concept with distinct tail fins projecting from the rear similar to the earlier models made the Trabant company.

The Chrysler 300 from 2011 to the present has subtle, but noticeable tailfins.

Though not officially mentioned by the manufacturer, reviews from the media compared the sharp angles of the fourth generation Toyota Prius tail-lights similar to tailfins. This is better seen when the tail-lights are lit.

<doc id="958982" wikidata="Q4697650" url="?curid=958982" title="AirCare">
<text>AirCare was an initiative started in 1992 to improve air quality in British Columbia, Canada through the systematic testing of road vehicles in order to reduce their emissions. Light-duty vehicles were suggested to be the biggest contributors to air pollutants that form smog and a small percentage of vehicles were contributing a large percentage of the pollutants. AirCare ran for 22 years and was cancelled on December 31, 2014. AirCare was cancelled due to the fact that new vehicles were continuously becoming more eco-friendly, and the percentage of old cars on the road was decreasing.

==History==
The AirCare emissions program was started in order to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles. Many car models had to pass yearly or biyearly AirCare inspections. The aim was to prevent old cars with high emissions from driving on the road without necessary repairs, thus protecting the air quality and lowering British Columbia&#x27;s carbon footprint. AirCare was not considered a for-profit program, and charged just enough to cover its costs. For example, in 2013 AirCare was charging $45 per test, but at the start of 2014 demand and therefore cost for the AirCare emissions test dropped to $36. In 2014, the price continued to drop $2 a month, and by December 2014, as the program was about to be cancelled, the price had dropped to $14.

===Start of program===

The AirCare emissions program was first started in 1992. The aim of this program was to actively monitor all vehicle emissions, and prevent cars with high levels of emissions from driving on the road. This was meant to decrease emissions and allow BC residents to breathe cleaner air. When AirCare was originally passed, all cars manufactured in 1991 or prior had to undergo AirCare evaluation and obtain a passing result yearly. Cars made in 1992 or later had to undergo inspection and obtain a passing result every two years. In order to check if a vehicle needed inspection, any vehicle owner could consult their Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) notice to renew document which would have contained the new AirCare &quot;pass&quot; date required to renew a vehicle owner&#x27;s insurance.

===AirCare testing===
Each vehicle type and model year tested for AirCare had its own pass/fail criteria that were dependent on the emissions standards at the time said vehicle was built. AirCare tested for levels of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and diesel particulates. Certain vehicles that were considered light-duty were exempt from AirCare. Such vehicles included:
* vehicle models newer than 2006
* vehicles with vintage or collector plates
* motorcycles, snowmobiles, amphibious vehicles and ATVs
* farm fleet and agricultural vehicles
* motor homes with a net vehicles weight over 3500 kg
* electric vehicles

===Testing sites===
Testing sites were provided by Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) and other insurance offices, as well as private licensed mechanics and auto-shops. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) goal was to make testing sites accessible to all residents, and many Greater Vancouver areas had their own testing sites. A few testing sites are listed below in order to illustrate AirCare testing site accessibility:
* Abbotsford: 3380 McCallum Road
* Chilliwack: 45730 Airport Road
* Coquitlam: 1316 United Blvd.
* Langley: 5958 205A Street
*Maple Ridge: 11469 Kingston Street
* North Vancouver: 1333 Mckeen Ave.
* Richmond: 11115 Silversmith Place
*Surrey: 7910 130th Street
* Vancouver East: 3608 Charles Street
* Vancouver South: 728 E. Kent Avenue South 

==Effectiveness of the program==
AirCare was effective in preventing high emission vehicles from being legally allowed to drive, and thus reduced vehicle emissions. During the 22 years that the program was in operation, program officials concluded that the program reduced annual emissions by an average of 6,500 tonnes a year. However, AirCare failure rate has been gradually dropping. In 2007, 14% of vehicles that were tested failed AirCare. In 2014, this number dropped to less than 8%. The combination of the reduced emissions of newer cars, and the modifications made to many older cars due to AirCare combined to reduce harmful vehicle emissions.

The AirCare program was estimated to have reduced air emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles by 24% or 85 tones per year.

==Cancellation==

The AirCare program lost its necessity as emission levels in newer cars fell and the number of older vehicles in use decreased. Criticism of the program as an unnecessary &quot;tax-grab&quot; did exist, even though no tax dollars were actually sent into the program. Other factors in the decision of its closure include the rising cost of staff and equipment, resulting in higher costs for ICBC programs. In its lifespan, AirCare did see the number of cars failing its test drop overall.

===Impact on drivers===

Waiving the necessity of AirCare to purchase car insurance has made the latter more affordable since the program&#x27;s cancellation. The reaction regarding AirCare&#x27;s end was mixed. The view of the people who were against the cancellation was that AirCare was essential for older vehicles on the road, and that it should have expanded to safety issues, beyond just an emission program. On the other hand, others were pleased because they could buy cars without having to get a permit first.

Commercial trucks that were not tested in the past are now under tests since they mostly run on diesel, which emits more pollution than regular gas.

==Other initiatives==

The British Columbia&#x27;s innovative Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program (BC SCRAP-IT) is a program that offers distinct incentive which helps reduce high levels of emission and supports alternative forms of transportation: public transit, membership in ride-share or care-share programs (car pool), and/or purchase of a bicycle.

Ever since the cancellation of AirCare, the government of British Columbia has been working on ways to make heavy-duty vehicles cleaner. They have come up with nine ways. First, the government retrofitted their heavy-duty vehicles and actively promote and use of biodiesel. Second, older models of transit buses were also retrofitted. The transit buses can run up to 30 years of service, even though new and better models come out it was wise to clean the older models so they can be reused. Third, the ministry of education invested $10 million to buy new cleaner school buses. Fourth, the government plans to expand the Aircare to more regions of the provinces for heavy-duty vehicles. Fifth, the government gave out incentives to have big diesels stop idling. Typical inner-city tracker trailers tend to sit idling for 1,800 hours a year, which is equivalent to approximately 75 days of wasting fuel, costing money and burning fuel into the atmosphere. So the government has been working to set up electric charge systems to stop the trailers from running on fuel. Sixth, the government will invest in green vehicle fleets. Green Fleets B.C. (GFBC) will be an important factor on the latest green technologies for private and public sectors. Such as the taxis, emergency vehicles, delivery vans and commercial fleet trucks. GFBC also forms part of the government&#x27;s climate change strategy, which includes the reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 33% by 2020. Seventh, they will use biodiesel in government diesel vehicles. Biodiesel is reusable fuel that is made from fats and oils of animals and plants. It is often mixed with diesel fuel and can be used in any time that the diesel fuel can be used. Eighth, B.C. government will buy green. British Columbia&#x27;s government is highly green friendly and is working to incorporate their strategies into buildings, vehicle fleets and the purchase or lease of other goods and services. Finally, the BC government is in Support with Greener ports and marine vessels. Vancouver&#x27;s ports play a crucial role in the British Columbia&#x27;s economy. As the ports in Vancouver&#x27; are an important asset to the government, the government will work in partnership with the ports and related organizations to test new ways to reduce emissions from port operations.

Government representatives have stated that they will pass: &quot;A new greenhouse gas reduction regulation that offers incentives to utility companies for natural gas transportation fleets - including buses, trucks or ferries, as well as the creation and operation of compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas fuelling stations.&quot;

A $2 million government investment to help the businesses exchange their heavy-duty diesel truck and equipment into more fuel efficient machines was set up as a low-interest loan program, which saved money and helped reduce carbon emissions. This plan is estimated to reduce 13,400 tones of emissions over the first three years. The long-term goal for this $17 million plan is to make cleaner energy vehicles, building, charging stations and BC SCRAP-IT society.

<doc id="958984" wikidata="Q4756821" url="?curid=958984" title="Andrew Doria (1775 brig)">
<text>Andrew Doria was a brig purchased by the Continental Congress in November 1775. She is most famous for her participation in the Battle of Nassau—the first amphibious engagement by the Continental Navy and the Continental Marines—and for being the first United States vessel to receive a salute from a foreign power.

==Purchase==
On 13 October 1775, the Continental Congress authorized the purchase of the merchant brig &quot;Defiance&quot;. The ship was acquired in mid-November and moored in Wharton and Humphreys shipyard in Philadelphia where she was converted into a warship by Joshua Humphreys (hull strengthening), John Barry (re-rigging), and John Falconer (ordnance and provisioning) at a cost of £296.4s.6d. She was named &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria. Under the command of Captain Nicholas Biddle, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; departed Philadelphia on 4 January 1776, as a warship in Esek Hopkins&#x27; small fleet of five newly fitted warships (&quot;Alfred&quot;, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot;, &quot;Columbus&quot;, and &quot;Providence&quot;), bound for the Chesapeake Bay. Between 11 and 17 February, the fleet was joined by the small sloop &quot;Fly&quot;, the sloop &quot;Hornet&quot;, and the schooner &quot;Wasp&quot;.

==Battle of Nassau==

On 17 February 1776, Hopkins decided to take advantage of the discretion offered him and skip his missions in the Chesapeake Bay and along the coasts of the Carolinas. Instead, he took the fleet to the Bahamas for a raid on the island of New Providence to seize a large supply of gunpowder reportedly stored in the two forts that protected Nassau. On 1 March, the fleet reached the coast of Abaco Island where the ship &quot;Alfred&quot; captured two small sloops and Hopkins obtained intelligence from the prisoners that New Providence lay undefended. Hopkins planned to take Nassau by frontal assault, slipping his landing party of 270 sailors and marines into the harbor hidden on board the captured sloops. It was hoped that the American troops would not be detected until the landing and assault on Fort Nassau began. Success in this endeavor would enable the fleet to enter the harbor while the fort&#x27;s guns, then in American hands, held the town at bay.

The marines and sailors embarked on the two captured sloops on the evening of 2 March and headed for New Providence, hoping to arrive at daybreak. While following the sloops, the fleet attempted to remain out of sight until the landing party had secured the fort. &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;—popularly referred to as the &quot;Black Brig&quot;—outdistanced her consorts and found it necessary to lay-to until the other American warships caught up. As the troop-carrying sloops headed into the harbor, Fort Nassau&#x27;s guns opened fire. The shot fell short but demonstrated that the American fleet had been detected and that its intentions had been surmised. Hopkins recalled his ships.

After conferring with his officers, Hopkins decided to land his troops two miles (3 km) down the coast from Fort Montagu, which protected the eastern approaches to Nassau. The marines and sailors went ashore on 3 March and marched to Fort Montagu whose garrison surrendered without offering any real resistance. On 4 March, the Americans took Fort Nassau and town of Nassau. The fleet remained for almost two weeks, dismantling the guns of the forts and loading the captured materiel. During this stay, large numbers of the crew of each ship were stricken by a virulent fever. This complicated an already serious health problem caused by an outbreak of smallpox on all of the ships except for &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; whose crew had been protected by inoculation due to the far-sighted insistence of Nicholas Biddle. As a result of the crew&#x27;s immunization, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; was selected to serve as a hospital ship for the fleet and continued in this role for the remainder of the expedition. On 16 March, Hopkin&#x27;s fleet departed Nassau and headed north.

==Battle of Block Island==

Shortly after midnight on 6 April 1776, a lookout on &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; sighted two vessels to the southeast. Biddle passed word of the discovery to Hopkins who ordered the fleet to head for the strangers. The larger of the unidentified ships headed toward the Americans and before long she was within hailing distance and identified herself as &quot;... his majesty&#x27;s ship of war &quot;Glasgow&quot;...&quot; A broadside from &quot;Cabot&quot; into the British frigate opened a fierce fight in which the American ships were unable to fight as a squadron. In attempting to avoid a salvo from &quot;Glasgow&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot; crossed &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;&#x27;s bow, forcing Biddle&#x27;s brig onto a port tack which avoided collision but took her away from the action. Meanwhile, &quot;Alfred&quot; and &quot;Columbus&quot;, Hopkins&#x27; largest warships, took on &quot;Glasgow&quot; but received worse punishment than they inflicted.

As the crew of &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; worked the ship into position to reenter the engagement and opened fire, &quot;Glasgow&quot;&#x27;s captain realized he was overmatched and decided to stand off to the northward. &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;, followed at a distance by her consorts, gave chase and kept up a running fight with her bow chasers until recalled by Hopkins, lest &quot;Glasgow&quot; lead his fleet to a Royal Navy squadron then operating in Rhode Island waters. When the American fleet had reformed, it retired to New London, Connecticut, where it arrived on the morning of 8 April.

==Change of command==
From 9 April to 17 September 1776, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; patrolled the Atlantic coast from Connecticut to Bermuda, capturing a number of British and Loyalist ships. On 11 July she captured ship &quot;Nathaniel &amp; Elizabeth&quot;. Capt. Biddle anchored his brig at Chester, Pennsylvania, on the evening of 17 September, ending his last cruise on the warship, as he had been selected to command &quot;Randolph&quot;, one of the four new frigates being built at Philadelphia for the Continental Navy. Capt. Isaiah Robinson took command of &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;.

==First salute==
Robinson sailed &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; down the Delaware River on 17 October 1776, for a voyage to the West Indies to obtain a cargo of munitions and military supplies at the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius. When the brig reached the island on 16 November, she fired a 13-gun salute and received a reply from Fort Oranje—the first salute to an American flag on board an American warship in a foreign port. &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; also carried a copy of the Declaration of Independence to the island. The so-called &quot;first salute&quot; was widely reported in the United States at the time, and later provided the title for Barbara Tuchman&#x27;s 1988 book, &quot;The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution&quot;.

On her way back to the Delaware River, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; encountered the sloop HMS &quot;Racehorse&quot;, of 10 guns, and under the command of Commander James Jones. A two-hour single-ship action ensued before &quot;Racehorse&quot; struck. &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; had lost four men killed and eight wounded; casualties on &quot;Racehorse&quot; apparently were higher. &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; encountered a British snow and assigned Joshua Barney to return the ship to Philadelphia, but was captured with a fouled rudder off Chincoteage by . The captain released Barney on pardon in Charleston to return to Philadelphia on foot over 19 days. &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; returned to Philadelphia where the Continental Navy acquired &quot;Racehorse&quot;, which it renamed &quot;Surprise&quot;.

==Scuttling==
&quot;Andrew Doria&quot; was stationed in the Delaware River through the spring and summer of 1777. After Vice Admiral Lord Howe brought his British fleet into the river in September 1777, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; was part of the forces charged with defending Philadelphia. Following the British occupation of Fort Mifflin on 16 November, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;, with the remaining ships of the Continental Navy, sought shelter under the guns of Fort Mercer, at Red Bank, New Jersey. With the evacuation of Fort Mercer on 20 November, Robinson gave orders the next day for the ships to be burned to prevent capture. This was done shortly thereafter.

==Replica==
The not-for-profit organization Andrew Doria – The First Salute, Inc., is raising funds to build a working replica of &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;. On 18 May 2009, the city council of Havre de Grace, Maryland, agreed to lease land to the organization for the construction of a shipyard which will be located near the Susquehanna Museum at the Lockhouse on the banks of the Susquehanna River.

<text>Santo André (, &quot;Saint Andrew&quot;) is a Brazilian municipality located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. It is part of a group of municipalities known as the ABC Region. According to the most recent census in 2022, the population is estimated at 748,919 in an area of 175.8 km². or about 43,441 Acres of landmass.

It is the 15th most developed Brazilian city, and the eighth most developed city in the State of São Paulo, according to the UN. The city is also known to be the fifth best city in the country to raise children on the grounds of public and private education and health care.

==History==
The first settlement named Santo André in the region where the modern city stands was founded by João Ramalho in 1553, with the name of Santo André da Borda do Campo. However, this first village was short lived, as in 1560, the then governor-general of the State of Brazil, Mem de Sá, ordered the transfer of inhabitants to the proximities of the Jesuit college of São Paulo, which was deemed to be in a more secure position.

A town with the name of Santo André would only emerge again in the 1938, when the headquarters of the then municipality of São Bernardo was transferred to the proximities of the then-district of Santo André, near a train station founded in 1867 by means of the São Paulo Railway Company. The town experienced rapid growth beginning in the 1930s.
Industries include chemical engineering, textiles, oil, metal products, metallurgy and printed matter. Despite being an industrial city, more than 60% of Santo André&#x27;s total area are protected by environmental water laws, mainly in the district of Paranapiacaba.

In 1954, it became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santo André.

In 2002, the city rose to national prominence with the assassination of serving mayor Celso Daniel, whose murder remains unsolved.

<doc id="958988" wikidata="Q3404929" url="?curid=958988" title="History of astrology">
<text>Astrological belief in relation between celestial observations and terrestrial events have influenced various aspects of human history, including world-views, language and many elements of culture. It has been argued that astrology began as a study as soon as human beings made conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles.

Early evidence of such practices appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that the lunar cycle was being noted as early as 25,000 years ago; the first step towards recording the Moon&#x27;s influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organizing a communal calendar. With the Neolithic Revolution new needs were also being met by the increasing knowledge of constellations, whose appearances in the night-time sky change with the seasons, thus allowing the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, widespread civilisations had developed sophisticated understanding of celestial cycles, and are believed to have consciously oriented their temples to create alignment with the heliacal risings of the stars.

There is scattered evidence to suggest that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made during this period, particularly in Mesopotamia. Two, from the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa (compiled in Babylon round 1700 BC) are reported to have been made during the reign of king Sargon of Akkad (2334–2279 BC). Another, showing an early use of electional astrology, is ascribed to the reign of the Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash (c. 2144–2124 BC). However, there is controversy over whether they were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is attributed to records that emerge from the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950–1651 BC).

Among West Eurasian peoples, the earliest evidence for astrology dates from the 3rd millennium BC, with roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Until the 17th century, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition, and it helped drive the development of astronomy. It was commonly accepted in political and cultural circles, and some of its concepts were used in other traditional studies, such as alchemy, meteorology and medicine. By the end of the 17th century, emerging scientific concepts in astronomy, such as heliocentrism, undermined the theoretical basis of astrology, which subsequently lost its academic standing and became regarded as a pseudoscience. Empirical scientific investigation has shown that predictions based on these systems are not accurate.

In the 20th century, astrology gained broader consumer popularity through the influence of regular mass media products, such as newspaper horoscopes.

==Babylonian astrology==

Babylonian astrology is the earliest recorded organized system of astrology, arising in the 2nd millennium BC. There is speculation that astrology of some form appeared in the Sumerian period in the 3rd millennium BC, but the isolated references to ancient celestial omens dated to this period are not considered sufficient evidence to demonstrate an integrated theory of astrology. The history of scholarly celestial divination is therefore generally reported to begin with late Old Babylonian texts (), continuing through the Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian periods ().

By the 16th century BC the extensive employment of omen-based astrology can be evidenced in the compilation of a comprehensive reference work known as &quot;Enuma Anu Enlil&quot;. Its contents consisted of 70 cuneiform tablets comprising 7,000 celestial omens. Texts from this time also refer to an oral tradition – the origin and content of which can only be speculated upon. At this time Babylonian astrology was solely mundane, concerned with the prediction of weather and political matters, and prior to the 7th century BC the practitioners&#x27; understanding of astronomy was fairly rudimentary. Astrological symbols likely represented seasonal tasks, and were used as a yearly almanac of listed activities to remind a community to do things appropriate to the season or weather (such as symbols representing times for harvesting, gathering shell-fish, fishing by net or line, sowing crops, collecting or managing water reserves, hunting, and seasonal tasks critical in ensuring the survival of children and young animals for the larger group). By the 4th century, their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy, at which point extensive ephemerides began to appear.

Babylonian astrology developed within the context of divination. A collection of 32 tablets with inscribed liver models, dating from about 1875 BC, are the oldest known detailed texts of Babylonian divination, and these demonstrate the same interpretational format as that employed in celestial omen analysis. Blemishes and marks found on the liver of the sacrificial animal were interpreted as symbolic signs which presented messages from the gods to the king.

The gods were also believed to present themselves in the celestial images of the planets or stars with whom they were associated. Evil celestial omens attached to any particular planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented. Such indications were met with attempts to appease the god and find manageable ways by which the god&#x27;s expression could be realised without significant harm to the king and his nation. An astronomical report to the king Esarhaddon concerning a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute kings, or substitute events, combined an unquestioning belief in magic and omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must have some kind of correlate within the natural world: 

Ulla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book &quot;Mesopotamian Astrology&quot;, argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its heavy reliance on magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of revenge, and so &quot;shares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations&quot;. Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries, cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation. Mundane astrology is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology. It was only with the gradual emergence of horoscopic astrology, from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of natal astrology.

==Hellenistic Egypt==

In 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, historian Tamsyn Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the Egyptian zodiac, which shared two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the Dendera Zodiac (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion&#x27;s Claws).

After the occupation by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, Egypt came under Hellenistic rule and influence. The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the Ptolemaic scholars of Alexandria were prolific writers. It was in Ptolemaic Alexandria that Babylonian astrology was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of Decanic astrology to create Horoscopic astrology. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary exaltations, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. Along with this it incorporated the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and four elements.

The decans were a system of time measurement according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into &#x27;hours&#x27;. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over the course of the year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis. The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the Dendera Zodiac.

Particularly important in the development of horoscopic astrology was the Greco-Roman astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria during Roman Egypt. Ptolemy&#x27;s work the &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot; laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition, and as a source of later reference is said to have &quot;enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more&quot;. It was one of the first astrological texts to be circulated in Medieval Europe after being translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Tivoli (Tiburtinus) in Spain, 1138.

According to Firmicus Maternus (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named Nechepso and his priest Petosiris. The Hermetic texts were also put together during this period and Clement of Alexandria, writing in the Roman era, demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites:
This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for the king&#x27;s life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.

==Greece and Rome==
The conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to the cultures and cosmological ideas of Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Greek overtook cuneiform script as the international language of intellectual communication and part of this process was the transmission of astrology from cuneiform to Greek. Sometime around 280 BC, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of Kos in order to teach astrology and Babylonian culture to the Greeks. With this, what historian Nicholas Campion calls, &quot;the innovative energy&quot; in astrology moved west to the Hellenistic world of Greece and Egypt.
According to Campion, the astrology that arrived from the Eastern World was marked by its complexity, with different forms of astrology emerging. By the 1st century BC two varieties of astrology were in existence, one that required the reading of horoscopes in order to establish precise details about the past, present and future; the other being theurgic (literally meaning &#x27;god-work&#x27;), which emphasised the soul&#x27;s ascent to the stars. While they were not mutually exclusive, the former sought information about the life, while the latter was concerned with personal transformation, where astrology served as a form of dialogue with the Divine.

As with much else, Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to Rome. However, our earliest references to demonstrate its arrival in Rome reveal its initial influence upon the lower orders of society, and display concern about uncritical recourse to the ideas of Babylonian &#x27;star-gazers&#x27;. Among the Greeks and Romans, Babylonia (also known as Chaldea) became so identified with astrology that &#x27;Chaldean wisdom&#x27; came to be a common synonym for divination using planets and stars.

The first definite reference to astrology comes from the work of the orator Cato, who in 160 BC composed a treatise warning farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans. The 2nd-century Roman poet Juvenal, in his satirical attack on the habits of Roman women, also complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, despite their lowly social status, saying &quot;Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from Hammon&#x27;s fountain, ... nowadays no astrologer has credit unless he has been imprisoned in some distant camp, with chains clanking on either arm&quot;.

One of the first astrologers to bring Hermetic astrology to Rome was Thrasyllus, who, in the first century AD, acted as the astrologer for the emperor Tiberius. Tiberius was the first emperor reported to have had a court astrologer, although his predecessor Augustus had also used astrology to help legitimise his Imperial rights. In the second century AD, the astrologer Claudius Ptolemy was so obsessed with getting horoscopes accurate that he began the first attempt to make an accurate world map (maps before this were more relativistic or allegorical) so that he could chart the relationship between the person&#x27;s birthplace and the heavenly bodies. While doing so, he coined the term &quot;geography&quot;.

Even though some use of astrology by the emperors appears to have happened, there was also a prohibition on astrology to a certain extent as well. In the 1st century AD, Publius Rufus Anteius was accused of the crime of funding the banished astrologer Pammenes, and requesting his own horoscope and that of then emperor Nero. For this crime, Nero forced Anteius to commit suicide. At this time, astrology was likely to result in charges of magic and treason.

Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De divinatione&quot; (44 BC), which rejects astrology and other allegedly divinatory techniques, is a fruitful historical source for the conception of scientificity in Roman classical Antiquity. The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus compiled the ancient arguments against astrology in his book &quot;Against the Astrologers.&quot;

==Islamic world==
Astrology was taken up enthusiastically by Islamic scholars following the collapse of Alexandria to the Arabs in the 7th century, and the founding of the Abbasid empire in the 8th century. The second Abbasid caliph, Al Mansur (754–775) founded the city of Baghdad to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as &quot;Bayt al-Hikma&quot; &#x27;Storehouse of Wisdom&#x27;, which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic translations of Hellenistic astrological texts. The early translators included Mashallah, who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad, and Sahl ibn Bishr (a.k.a. &quot;Zael&quot;), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as Guido Bonatti in the 13th century, and William Lilly in the 17th century. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the Latin translations of the 12th century.

In the 9th century, Persian astrologer Albumasar was thought to be one of the greatest astrologer at that time. His practical manuals for training astrologers profoundly influenced Muslim intellectual history and, through translations, that of western Europe and Byzantium In the 10th century. Albumasar&#x27;s &quot;Introductorium in Astronomiam&quot; was one of the most important sources for the recovery of Aristotle for medieval European scholars. Another was the Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and geographer Al Khwarizmi. The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the star names that are commonly known today, such as Aldebaran, Altair, Betelgeuse, Rigel and Vega retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic lots to the extent that they became historically known as Arabic parts, for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas they are clearly known to have been an important feature of Hellenistic astrology.

During the advance of Islamic science some of the practices of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were conjectural rather than empirical, and conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars through the suggestion that the Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance. Such refutations mainly concerned &#x27;judicial branches&#x27; (such as horary astrology), rather than the more &#x27;natural branches&#x27; such as medical and meteorological astrology, these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time.

For example, Avicenna&#x27;s &#x27;Refutation against astrology&#x27; &quot;Resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm&quot;, argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God&#x27;s absolute power over creation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the capability of determining the exact influence of the stars. In essence, Avicenna did not refute the essential dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.

==Medieval and Renaissance Europe==


While astrology in the East flourished following the break up of the Roman world, with Indian, Persian and Islamic influences coming together and undergoing intellectual review through an active investment in translation projects, Western astrology in the same period had become &quot;fragmented and unsophisticated ... partly due to the loss of Greek scientific astronomy and partly due to condemnations by the Church.&quot;
Translations of Arabic works into Latin started to make their way to Spain by the late 10th century, and in the 12th century the transmission of astrological works from Arabia to Europe &quot;acquired great impetus&quot;.

By the 13th century astrology had become a part of everyday medical practice in Europe. Doctors combined Galenic medicine (inherited from the Greek physiologist Galen - AD 129–216) with studies of the stars. By the end of the 1500s, physicians across Europe were required by law to calculate the position of the Moon before carrying out complicated medical procedures, such as surgery or bleeding.
Influential works of the 13th century include those of the British monk Johannes de Sacrobosco ( 1195–1256) and the Italian astrologer Guido Bonatti from Forlì (Italy). Bonatti served the communal governments of Florence, Siena and Forlì and acted as advisor to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. His astrological text-book &quot;Liber Astronomiae&quot; (&#x27;Book of Astronomy&#x27;), written around 1277, was reputed to be &quot;the most important astrological work produced in Latin in the 13th century&quot;. Dante Alighieri immortalised Bonatti in his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (early 14th century) by placing him in the eighth Circle of Hell, a place where those who would divine the future are forced to have their heads turned around (to look backwards instead of forwards).
In medieval Europe, a university education was divided into seven distinct areas, each represented by a particular planet and known as the seven liberal arts. Dante attributed these arts to the planets. As the arts were seen as operating in ascending order, so were the planets in decreasing order of planetary speed: grammar was assigned to the Moon, the quickest moving celestial body, dialectic was assigned to Mercury, rhetoric to Venus, music to the Sun, arithmetic to Mars, geometry to Jupiter and astrology/astronomy to the slowest moving body, Saturn.

Medieval writers used astrological symbolism in their literary themes. For example, Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; builds varied references to planetary associations within his described architecture of Hell, Purgatory and Paradise, (such as the seven layers of Purgatory&#x27;s mountain purging the seven cardinal sins that correspond to astrology&#x27;s seven classical planets). Similar astrological allegories and planetary themes are pursued through the works of Geoffrey Chaucer.

Chaucer&#x27;s astrological passages are particularly frequent and knowledge of astrological basics is often assumed through his work. He knew enough of his period&#x27;s astrology and astronomy to write a &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot; for his son. He pinpoints the early spring season of the Canterbury Tales in the opening verses of the prologue by noting that the Sun &quot;hath in the Ram his halfe cours yronne&quot;. He makes the Wife of Bath refer to &quot;sturdy hardiness&quot; as an attribute of Mars, and associates Mercury with &quot;clerkes&quot;. In the early modern period, astrological references are also to be found in the works of William Shakespeare and John Milton.

One of the earliest English astrologers to leave details of his practice was Richard Trewythian (b. 1393). His notebook demonstrates that he had a wide range of clients, from all walks of life, and indicates that engagement with astrology in 15th-century England was not confined to those within learned, theological or political circles.

During the Renaissance, court astrologers would complement their use of horoscopes with astronomical observations and discoveries. Many individuals now credited with having overturned the old astrological order, such as Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler, were themselves practicing astrologers.

At the end of the Renaissance the confidence placed in astrology diminished, with the breakdown of Aristotelian Physics and rejection of the distinction between the celestial and sublunar realms, which had historically acted as the foundation of astrological theory. Keith Thomas writes that although heliocentrism is consistent with astrology theory, 16th and 17th century astronomical advances meant that &quot;the world could no longer be envisaged as a compact inter-locking organism; it was now a mechanism of infinite dimensions, from which the hierarchical subordination of earth to heaven had irrefutably disappeared&quot;. Initially, amongst the astronomers of the time, &quot;scarcely anyone attempted a serious refutation in the light of the new principles&quot; and in fact astronomers &quot;were reluctant to give up the emotional satisfaction provided by a coherent and interrelated universe&quot;. By the 18th century the intellectual investment which had previously maintained astrology&#x27;s standing was largely abandoned. Historian of science Ann Geneva writes:
==India==
The earliest recorded use of astrology in India is recorded during the Vedic period. Astrology, or &quot;jyotiṣa&quot; is listed as a Vedanga, or branch of the Vedas of the Vedic religion. The only work of this class to have survived is the &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot;, which contains rules for tracking the motions of the sun and the moon in the context of a five-year intercalation cycle. The date of this work is uncertain, as its late style of language and composition, consistent with the last centuries BC, albeit pre-Mauryan, conflicts with some internal evidence of a much earlier date in the 2nd millennium BC. Indian astronomy and astrology developed together. The earliest treatise on Jyotisha, the Bhrigu Samhita, was compiled by the sage Bhrigu during the Vedic era. The sage Bhirgu is also called the &#x27;Father of Hindu Astrology&#x27;, and is one of the venerated Saptarishi or seven Vedic sages. The Saptarishis are also symbolized by the seven main stars in the Ursa Major constellation.

The documented history of Jyotisha in the subsequent newer sense of modern horoscopic astrology is associated with the interaction of Indian and Hellenistic cultures through the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek Kingdoms. The oldest surviving treatises, such as the Yavanajataka or the Brihat-Samhita, date to the early centuries AD. The oldest astrological treatise in Sanskrit is the &quot;Yavanajataka&quot; (&quot;Sayings of the Greeks&quot;), a versification by Sphujidhvaja in 269/270 AD of a now lost translation of a Greek treatise by Yavanesvara during the 2nd century AD under the patronage of the Indo-Scythian king Rudradaman I of the Western Satraps.

Written on pages of tree bark, the Samhita (Compilation) is said to contain five million horoscopes comprising all who have lived in the past or will live in the future. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy are from the 5th century AD, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of Aryabhata in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; and the lost &quot;Arya-siddhānta&quot;, there is the &quot;Pancha-Siddhāntika&quot; of Varahamihira.

==China==
The Chinese astrological system is based on native astronomy and calendars, and its significant development is tied to that of native astronomy, which came to flourish during the Han dynasty (2nd century BC – 2nd century AD).

Chinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy (theory of three harmonies: heaven, earth and water) and uses the principles of yin and yang, and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the &quot;wu xing&quot; teachings, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, the lunisolar calendar (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day and &quot;shichen&quot; (時辰).

Astrology was traditionally regarded highly in China, and Confucius is said to have treated astrology with respect saying: &quot;Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly&quot;. The 60-year cycle combining the five elements with the twelve animal signs of the zodiac has been documented in China since at least the time of the Shang (Shing or Yin) dynasty (c. 1766 BC – c. 1050 BC). Oracle bones have been found dating from that period with the date according to the 60-year cycle inscribed on them, along with the name of the diviner and the topic being divined. Astrologer Tsou Yen lived around 300 BC, and wrote: &quot;When some new dynasty is going to arise, heaven exhibits auspicious signs for the people&quot;.

There is debate as to whether the Babylonian astrology influenced early development of Chinese astrology. Later in the 6th century, the translation of the &quot;Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra&quot; brought the Babylonian system to China. Though it did not displace Chinese astrology, it was referenced in several poems.

==Mesoamerica==

The calendars of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. The earliest calendars were employed by peoples such as the Zapotecs and Olmecs, and later by such peoples as the Maya, Mixtec and Aztecs. Although the Mesoamerican calendar did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements to it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood.

The distinctive Mayan calendar used two main systems, one plotting the solar year of 360 days, which governed the planting of crops and other domestic matters; the other called the Tzolkin of 260 days, which governed ritual use. Each was linked to an elaborate astrological system to cover every facet of life. On the fifth day after the birth of a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim. A 584-day Venus cycle was also maintained, which tracked the appearance and conjunctions of Venus. Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose. There is evidence that the Maya also tracked the movements of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, and possessed a zodiac of some kind. The Mayan name for the constellation Scorpio was also &#x27;scorpion&#x27;, while the name of the constellation Gemini was &#x27;peccary&#x27;. There is some evidence for other constellations being named after various beasts. The most famous Mayan astrological observatory still intact is the Caracol observatory in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in modern-day Mexico.

The Aztec calendar shares the same basic structure as the Mayan calendar, with two main cycles of 360 days and 260 days. The 260-day calendar was called Tonalpohualli and was used primarily for divinatory purposes. Like the Mayan calendar, these two cycles formed a 52-year &#x27;century&#x27;, sometimes called the Calendar Round.

<text>Messier 15 or M15 (also designated NGC 7078 and sometimes known as the Great Pegasus Cluster) is a globular cluster in the constellation Pegasus. It was discovered by Jean-Dominique Maraldi in 1746 and included in Charles Messier&#x27;s catalogue of comet-like objects in 1764. At an estimated billion years old, it is one of the oldest known globular clusters.

==Characteristics==
M 15 is about 35,700 light-years from Earth, and 175 light-years in diameter. It has an absolute magnitude of −9.2, which translates to a total luminosity of 360,000 times that of the Sun. Messier 15 is one of the most densely packed globulars known in the Milky Way galaxy. Its core has undergone a contraction known as &quot;core collapse&quot; and it has a central density cusp with an enormous number of stars surrounding what may be a central black hole.

Home to over 100,000 stars,the cluster is notable for containing a large number of variable stars (112) and pulsars (8), including one double neutron star system, M15-C. It also contains Pease 1, the first planetary nebula discovered within a globular cluster in 1928. Just three others have been found in globular clusters since then.

==Amateur astronomy==
At magnitude 6.2, M15 approaches naked eye visibility under good conditions and can be observed with binoculars or a small telescope, appearing as a fuzzy star. Telescopes with a larger aperture (at least 6 in. (150 mm)) will start to reveal individual stars, the brightest of which are of magnitude +12.6. The cluster appears 18 arc minutes in size (three tenths of a degree across). M15 is around 4° WNW of the brightest star of Pegasus, Epsilon Pegasi.

==X-ray sources==
Earth-orbiting satellites Uhuru and Chandra X-ray Observatory have detected two bright X-ray sources in this cluster: Messier 15 X-1 (4U 2129+12) and Messier 15 X-2. The former appears to be the first astronomical X-ray source detected in Pegasus.

<text>The Dresden Green Diamond, also known as the Dresden Green, is a natural green diamond which originated in the mines of India.
The Dresden Green is a rare Type IIa, with a clarity of VS1 and is said to be potentially internally flawless, if slightly recut.

It is named after Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony, where it has been on display for most of the last two centuries, latterly in the New Green Vault at Dresden Castle. After World War II, it was relocated to Moscow for a decade before being returned to Dresden. In November 2019, it was sent on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, so it was not taken in the jewel theft of 25 November.

== History ==

The Dresden Green Diamond has a historical record dating back to 1722, when a London news-sheet carried an article about it in its 25 October-27th edition. It was acquired by Augustus III of Poland from a Dutch merchant in 1742 at the Leipzig Fair. In 1768, the diamond was incorporated into an extremely valuable hat ornament, surrounded by two large and 411 medium-sized and small diamonds. This is the setting that the Dresden Green still appears in today.

In 2000, American jewelry firm Harry Winston arranged to display the Dresden Green at the New York flagship store and then at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC, United States, where it was displayed in the Harry Winston pavilion next to the largest blue diamond in the world, the Hope Diamond.

In 2019, the Dresden Green Diamond narrowly escaped being stolen in the Dresden Green Vault burglary, due to it being loaned to New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art at the time.

== Color ==

The stone&#x27;s unique apple green color is due to natural exposure to radioactive materials, as the irradiation of diamonds can produce changes in color. The Dresden Green Diamond has been used to compare natural versus lab-produced green diamonds — it is hoped that it can be used to devise a test to differentiate between naturally green diamonds, which are quite rare, and lab-produced ones.

== In popular culture ==
The plot of Nicolas Freeling&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;The Dresden Green&quot; concerns an imaginary theft of the Dresden Green diamond and attempts to recover it.

<doc id="959007" wikidata="Q84150" url="?curid=959007" title="Hermann Broch">
<text>Hermann Broch (; 1 November 1886 – 30 May 1951) was an Austrian writer, best known for two major works of modernist fiction: &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; (&quot;Die Schlafwandler,&quot; 1930–32) and &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot; (&quot;Der Tod des Vergil,&quot; 1945).

==Life==
Broch was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, to a prosperous Jewish family and worked for some time in his family&#x27;s factory, though he maintained his literary interests privately. As the oldest son, he was expected to take over his father’s textile factory in Teesdorf; therefore, he attended a technical college for textile manufacture and a spinning and weaving college.

In 1909 he converted to Roman Catholicism and married Franziska von Rothermann, the daughter of a knighted manufacturer. The following year, their son Hermann Friedrich Maria was born. His marriage ended in divorce in 1923. In 1927 he sold the textile factory and decided to study mathematics, philosophy and psychology at the University of Vienna. He embarked on a full-time literary career around the age of 40. At the age of 45, his first major literary work, the trilogy &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot;, was published by Daniel Brody for the Rhein Verlag in Munich in three volumes from 1930 to 1932.

He was acquainted with many of the writers, intellectuals, and artists of his time, including Robert Musil, Rainer Maria Rilke, Elias Canetti, Leo Perutz, Franz Blei and writer and former nude model Ea von Allesch. 

After the annexation of Austria by the Nazis on 12 March 1938, Broch was arrested in the small Alpine town of Bad Aussee for possession of a socialist magazine and detained in the district jail from the 13th to the 31st of March. Shortly thereafter, a movement organized by friends – including James Joyce, Thornton Wilder, and his translators Edwin and Willa Muir – managed to help him emigrate; first to Britain and then to the United States, where he published his novel &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot; and his collection of short stories &quot;The Guiltless&quot;. While in exile, he also continued to write on politics and work on mass psychology, similar to Elias Canetti and Hannah Arendt. His essay on mass behaviour remained unfinished. Broch&#x27;s work on mass psychology was intended to form part of more ambitious project to defend democracy, human rights, and human dignity as irreducible ethical absolutes in a postreligious age. 

From the 15th of August to the 15th of September 1939, Hermann Broch lived at the Albert Einstein House at 112 Mercer Street Princeton, New Jersey when the Einsteins were on vacation. From 1942 to 1948 Broch lived in an attic apartment in Eric and Lili Kahler&#x27;s house at One Evelyn Place in Princeton, New Jersey. Broch died in 1951 in New Haven, Connecticut. He is buried in Killingworth, Connecticut, in the cemetery on Roast Meat Hill Road. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950.

==Work==
Broch&#x27;s first major literary work was the trilogy &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; (&quot;Die Schlafwandler&quot;), published in three volumes from 1930 to 1932. Broch centers the essay &quot;Zerfall der Werte&quot; (&quot;The Disintegration of Values&quot;) in the final novel, providing an overarching theory of the trilogy&#x27;s form and approach to contemporary culture. The trilogy has been praised by Milan Kundera, whose writing has been greatly influenced by Broch.

One of his foremost works, &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot; (&quot;Der Tod des Vergil&quot;) was first published in June 1945 in both its English translation and original German. Having begun the text as a short radio lecture in 1937, Broch expanded and redeveloped the text over the next eight years of his life, which witnessed a short incarceration in an Austrian prison after the Austrian Anschluss, his flight to Scotland via England, and his eventual exile in the United States. This extensive, difficult novel interweaves reality, hallucination, poetry and prose, and reenacts the last 18 hours of the Roman poet Virgil&#x27;s life in the port of Brundisium (Brindisi). Here, shocked by the balefulness (&quot;Unheil&quot;) of the society he glorifies in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the feverish Virgil resolves to burn his epic, but is thwarted by his close friend and emperor Augustus before he succumbs to his fatal ailment. The final chapter exhibits the final hallucinations of the poet, where Virgil voyages to a distant land at which he witnesses roughly the biblical creation story in reverse.

Broch&#x27;s last work to be published before his death was &quot;The Guiltless&quot; (&quot;Die Schuldlosen&quot;, 1950), a collection of stories. An incomplete novel was posthumously published in German as: &quot;Der Versucher&quot; in 1953, &quot;Demeter&quot; in 1967, &quot;Bergroman&quot; in 1969, and &quot;Die Verzauberung&quot; in 1976. The first manuscript was translated into English as &quot;The Spell&quot; by Broch&#x27;s son, H.F. Broch de Rothermann and published in 1987.

Broch demonstrates mastery of a wide range of styles, from the gentle parody of Theodor Fontane in the first volume of &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; through the essayistic segments of the third volume to the phantasmagoria in verse form of &quot;The Death of Virgil.&quot;

<text>The Gibson EDS-1275 is a double neck Gibson electric guitar introduced in 1958 and still in production. Popularized and raised to iconic status by musicians such as John McLaughlin and Jimmy Page, it was called &quot;the coolest guitar in rock&quot;.

==History==

Gibson&#x27;s first doubleneck guitars were produced from 1958 to 1961 with a hollow body and two 6-string necks, one being a short-scale neck tuned to a higher octave; from 1962 to 1967 it had a solid body. A model with a 4-string bass and a 6-string guitar neck was called the EBS-1250; it had a built-in fuzztone and was produced from 1962 to 1968 and again from 1977 to 1978.

In 1963, the solid-body EDS-1275 was designed, resembling the SG model; this version of the doubleneck was available until 1968. The guitar was available in jet black, cherry, sunburst, and white.

In 1974, Gibson started making the guitar again, in a number of additional colors, with production lasting until 1998. Since then, alpine white and heritage cherry versions were made by Gibson USA in Nashville, Tennessee, until 2003, in the Nashville Custom Shop from 2004 to 2005, and in the Memphis, Tennessee, Custom Shop beginning in 2006.

==Notable EDS-1275 users==

The EDS-1275, while never selling in great quantities, was used by a number of notable musicians. Chicago bluesman Earl Hooker is seen holding one on the cover of the 1969 albums &quot;Two Bugs and a Roach&quot; and &quot;The Moon is Rising&quot;, and Elvis Presley sports a cherry doubleneck in the 1966 movie &quot;Spinout&quot;.

===John McLaughlin===

In the early 1970s, jazz-rock musician John McLaughlin played an EDS-1275 in his first years with the Mahavishnu Orchestra.

===Charlie Whitney===

Another guitar player who was known for playing the EDS-1275 was Charlie Whitney, the principal guitarist for the British underground band Family. Clips of Whitney performing with his EDS-1275 are readily available on YouTube from Family appearances on &quot;Beat-Club&quot; and &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test.&quot;
===Jimmy Page===
The EDS-1275 was mostly popularized by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, most notably during live performances of &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; The doubleneck eliminated the need to switch guitars mid-song: at the beginning of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, he used the bottom 6-string neck for the intro and first verse, then switched to the top 12-string neck, then to the 6-string neck for the extended guitar solo, and back to the 12-string for the final chorus.

By the time Page desired an EDS-1275, they were no longer in production so he ordered a custom-made cherry 6/12. Page&#x27;s influence was such that after him other guitarists picked up the EDS-1275, including Alex Lifeson of Rush, who used it to play the song &quot;Xanadu&quot; live. Eddie Van Halen also had one in his collection which he used live and in the studio on the track &quot;Secrets&quot; from Van Halen&#x27;s &#x27;Diver Down&#x27; LP. Tommy Shaw of Styx had a custom double neck which had two 12 string necks which he used live with Styx on the band&#x27;s live performances from 1977 to 1983 on &quot;Fooling Yourself&quot; (live versions from 1977 and 1978), &quot;Suite Madame Blue&quot; (up to the end of the synthesizer solo where he would switch to his Les Paul or Explorer or Ibanez guitar) and &quot;Queen Of Spades&quot; (for the intro and outro).

=== Don Felder ===
Don Felder&#x27;s white EDS-1275 was most famously used for playing &quot;Hotel California&quot; live with the Eagles and now (via Gibson Custom Shop replicas) in solo shows. It can be seen in any number of clips from the mid to late 1970s. Felder customized his EDS-1275 by removing one of the pots (bridge pickup tone control), and replacing it with a second output. This allowed for the signal to be sent to two separate amplifiers: for &quot;Hotel California&quot;, an Echoplex and a Leslie for the swirling tones (played on the 12 string neck capo at the seven fret), and then later through his standard guitar amp (a Blackface Deluxe Reverb or Tweed Deluxe) using the six string neck for the duet/harmony guitar solo shared with Joe Walsh. Felder&#x27;s original EDS-1275 is on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.

==Models==
===Current model===

, the guitar is offered only through the Gibson Custom Shop as a special order model. It features two volume and two tone control knobs, a three-way pickup-selector switch, and a three-way neck-selector switch. It has vintage tulip tuners, pearloid split parallelogram inlays, black pickguards and pickup rings, twenty frets per neck (bound with single-ply white binding), and 490 Alnico (R) and 498 Alnico (T) humbucking pickups. The Custom Shop also makes a Don Felder &quot;Hotel California&quot; signature model. New Gibson EDS-1275 and Epiphone G-1275 models feature longer 12-string headstocks than the original EDS-1275 and the &quot;Hotel California&quot; EDS-1275.

===Signature models===
Gibson released a Jimmy Page Signature EDS-1275 model in 2007; a total of 250 were made. Page kept serial number one for himself. Serial numbers 2 through 26 of these were played and signed by Page; number 11 was donated for auction to benefit a charitable cause.

In 2019, Gibson announced a black model for Slash.

==Similar models==
===Epiphone===

Epiphone (a Gibson subsidiary) makes a version of the classic doubleneck, marketing it as the G-1275.

===Ibanez===
Japanese guitar manufacturer Ibanez produced a model inspired by the Gibson, called the Double Axe, from 1974 to 1976. They were available as a 6/12, a 4/6, and a 6/6 configuration, in cherry and walnut finishes.

===Harley Benton===
German guitar manufacturer Harley Benton, which is the in-house brand for Thomann Music Store produces the &#x27;DC-Custom 612 Cherry&#x27; doubleneck at an affordable price point. It features 6/12 configuration with 22 fret necks.

<text>Young Timothy Hutchinson (born August 11, 1949) is an American politician, lobbyist, and former United States senator from the state of Arkansas. A Republican, he was the first Republican U.S. senator to represent Arkansas since the reconstruction era.

==Personal life==
Hutchinson was born in Bentonville in northwestern Arkansas, the son of John Malcolm Hutchinson, Sr. (1907–1991) and Coral Virginia (Mount) Hutchinson (1912–1998). He was raised on the family farm in nearby Gravette. He graduated with a B.A. from Bob Jones University and received an M.A. in political science from the University of Arkansas (1990).

He currently is a lobbyist and is a resident of Alexandria, Virginia. He is married to Randi Fredholm Hutchinson, an attorney in Washington, D.C. He was the first Republican to have been elected to the U.S. Senate in Arkansas since 1879.

==Early political career==
Hutchinson served in the Arkansas House of Representatives representing part of Fort Smith from 1985 to 1992. In 1992, he ran for the Republican nomination in after the popular 26-year incumbent John Paul Hammerschmidt announced his retirement. He defeated a fellow Republican state lawmaker Richard L. Barclay of Rogers, for the Republican nomination. He faced Democrat John VanWinkle, an attorney from Fayetteville, in the general election, and won by only 7,500 votes—a margin of five percent. He owed his victory to a 10,000-vote margin in his native Benton County. It was the second-closest margin in the 3rd, one of the most Republican districts in the South, which Hammerschmidt had represented since January 1967. The only closer race was in 1974, when Bill Clinton came within 6,300 votes of ousting Hammerschmidt. Clinton narrowly carried the 3rd in his successful run for president, a presumed factor in the closeness of the 1992 congressional race.

The district reverted to form in 1994, and Hutchinson was reelected with 63 percent of the vote.

==United States Senator==

===1996 election===
Hutchinson ran for the Senate seat being vacated by popular Democrat David Pryor in 1996. Initially, the leading Republican candidate was Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee. When Democratic Governor Jim Guy Tucker resigned after being convicted of mail fraud, however, Huckabee assumed the governorship and dropped out of the Senate race; Hutchinson entered soon after and captured the Republican nomination. He would face state Attorney General Winston Bryant in the general election. Even though native son Bill Clinton carried the state by a 17-point margin over Bob Dole in the presidential race, Hutchinson defeated Bryant 53–47% in the Senate election, largely by running up the votes in his congressional district. He became the first Republican Senator from Arkansas since Reconstruction, and the first to be popularly elected.

===Tenure===
Hutchinson opposes abortion, supports tax cuts, supports de-regulation of the economy, supports the death penalty and a Constitutional amendment banning flag burning, opposes same-sex marriage, and opposes expanding hate crimes legislation. In 1998, Hutchinson joined two other Republican Senators, Bob Smith of New Hampshire and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, in opposing President Bill Clinton&#x27;s nomination of James Hormel, an openly gay man, as United States Ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel was later confirmed as ambassador in a recess appointment.

He served on the Armed Services Committee, Aging Committee, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee. He was one of 16 co-sponsors of the Iraq Resolution (S.J.RES.46).

Senator Hutchinson honored the Little Rock Nine in the award ceremony for their Congressional Medals of Honor.

===2002 election===
Hutchinson faced Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor, David Pryor&#x27;s son, in his 2002 re-election campaign. During his term as U.S. Senator, Hutchinson had divorced his wife of almost three decades, Donna, a former Arkansas state representative, and married an aide in 2000. Hutchinson denied any impropriety, and Pryor refused to make the matter an issue in the campaign, but the well-publicized divorce substantially hurt his popularity. Pryor was also helped by the presence of his still popular father in a campaign commercial. Hutchinson lost to Pryor by eight points, making him the only Republican incumbent to be defeated that year.

==Post-political career==
Hutchinson joined the Washington, D.C.–based law firm of Dickstein Shapiro in January 2003 as a senior adviser. As of March 2016, Hutchinson serves as a senior director at the Washington, D.C. office of Greenberg Traurig.

==Family==
Hutchinson married his second wife, Randi Fredholm Hutchinson, a former senior member of staff, in 2000. He and his first wife, Donna Hutchinson, divorced in 1999 after 29 years. They have three sons: Jeremy Hutchinson, a former state representative; Timothy Chad Hutchinson, also a former state legislator; and Joshua Luke Hutchinson. On January 8, 2021, a lobbying report shows that Hutchinson paid The Tolman Group $10,000 to lobby for a pardon from Donald Trump for Jeremy, who had been convicted of bribery and tax fraud; however, President Trump did not pardon him.

Hutchinson&#x27;s brother is former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who succeeded him as member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, the former undersecretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial nominee in 2006, the same year that Donna Hutchinson was elected to the state House.

Tim and Asa Hutchinson are the brothers-in-law of Arkansas State Senator Kim Hendren, who married their sister, Marylea, in 1958. Hendren was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in the 2010 election. On May 18, he lost the primary to Congressman John Boozman, who would be elected later that year. Kim Hendren&#x27;s son, Jim Hendren, was elected in 2012 to the District 2 seat from Benton County in the Arkansas State Senate.

<text>Anticon (often styled as anticon.) was an independent record label based in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1998 by seven musicians and manager Baillie Parker. It was collectively owned among six musicians, co-founder Parker, and manager Shaun Koplow. The original musicians signed to Anticon were once referred to as the Anticon collective. Following the death of one of its founding members in 2018, the label dissolved.

==History==
The label&#x27;s roster of artists has been described as &quot;the hip-hop equivalent of post-rock&quot; and &quot;avant-garde hip-hop&quot;. Releases feature material created by its members, affiliates, and extended musical family. Although Anticon cohered originally within alternative hip hop circles, Anticon&#x27;s founders have become only tangentially related to hip hop, and the label has begun releasing music in the indie rock and electronica genres. Artists signed to Anticon are based in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

The artists within the collective have been known to perform and release music in solo and group form. Artists on the label are known for frequent collaboration, both within and outside of their own collective. However, the Anticon collective has over time evolved into a group of separate artists who, despite sharing a similar progressive and often challenging indie quality, explore different styles of music including electronica and rock. Many of the artists on Anticon are signed to multiple labels, and some have their own small, independent labels through which they have self-released material.

Anticon has also organized art exhibitions featuring visual art by several of the artists on the label.

On February 9, 2010, co-founder Sole (Tim Holland) left Anticon exclaiming that it is time to try to push forward and find new opportunities. He leaves citing business and ideological differences while maintaining his love for the artists on Anticon. He said, &quot;There are no ill feelings between myself and members of anticon. I will continue to work with many of the artists and will always love them as brothers and consider them allies.&quot; He officially renounced his 1/8 of ownership and formal affiliations.

On March 30, 2018, founding member Alias died of a heart attack at age 41. In November 2018, the label released a posthumous album from Alias that had been completed with label-mate Doseone prior to his death. The label had been quiet since then, and former co-founder Sole confirmed in July 2021 that the label had &quot;dissolved&quot; sometime after Alias&#x27;s death.

<text>The Omega Nebula is an H II region in the constellation Sagittarius. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745. Charles Messier catalogued it in 1764. It is by some of the richest starfields of the Milky Way, figuring in the northern two-thirds of Sagittarius. This feature is also known as the Swan Nebula, Checkmark Nebula, Lobster Nebula, and the Horseshoe Nebula, and catalogued as Messier 17 or M17 or NGC 6618.

== Characteristics ==
The Omega Nebula is between 5,000 and 6,000 light-years from Earth and it spans some 15 light-years in diameter. The cloud of interstellar matter of which this nebula is a part is roughly 40 light-years in diameter and has a mass of 30,000 solar masses. The total mass of the Omega Nebula is an estimated 800 solar masses.

It is considered one of the brightest and most massive star-forming regions of our galaxy. Its local geometry is similar to the Orion Nebula except that it is viewed edge-on rather than face-on.

The open cluster NGC 6618 lies embedded in the nebulosity and causes the gases of the nebula to shine due to radiation from these hot, young stars; however, the actual number of stars in the nebula is much higher – up to 800, 100 of spectral type earlier than B9, and 9 of spectral type O, plus over a thousand stars in formation on its outer regions. It is also one of the youngest clusters known, with an age of just 1 million years.

The luminous blue variable HD 168607, in the south-east part of the nebula, is generally assumed to be associated with it; its close neighbor, the blue hypergiant HD 168625, may be too.

The Swan portion of M17, the Omega Nebula in the Sagittarius nebulosity is said to resemble a barber&#x27;s pole.

== Early research ==
The first attempt to accurately draw the nebula (as part of a series of sketches of nebulae) was made by John Herschel in 1833, and published in 1836. He described the nebula as such:

A second, more detailed sketch was made during his visit to South Africa in 1837. The nebula was also studied by Johann von Lamont and separately by an undergraduate at Yale College, Mr Mason, starting from around 1836. When Herschel published his 1837 sketch in 1847, he wrote:
Sketches were also made by William Lassell in 1862 using his four-foot telescope at Malta, and by M. Trouvelot from Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Edward Singleton Holden in 1875 using the twenty-six inch Clark refractor at the United States Naval Observatory.

== Observations by SOFIA ==

In January 2020, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) provided new insights into the Omega Nebula. SOFIA&#x27;s composite image revealed that blue areas (20 microns) near the center indicate gas heated by massive stars, while green areas (37 microns) trace dust warmed by massive stars and newborn stars. Nine previously unseen protostars were discovered primarily in the southern regions. Red areas near the edges represent cold dust detected by the Herschel Space Telescope (70 microns), and the white star field was observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope (3.6 microns). These observations suggest that parts of the nebula formed separately, contributing to its distinctive swan-like shape.

<text>Janine Shepherd, is an Australian author, aerobatics pilot and former cross-country skier. Shepherd&#x27;s career as an athlete ended when she sustained life-threatening injuries when hit by a truck during a training bike ride, while in contention to win Australia&#x27;s first ever medal at the Winter Olympics. She survived and her story later became the focus of national attention, as well as a popular telemovie.

==Biography==
Shepherd had been an athletics champion as a child, and settled on cross-country skiing. After achieving success on the World circuit, she was given the offer of training with the Canadian team in the leadup to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. In 1986, Shepherd was cycling through the Blue Mountains in New South Wales as part of her training regime, when she was hit by a vehicle, suffering massive injuries. She suffered a broken neck and back, lost five litres of blood, had severe lacerations to her abdominal area. Her right leg was ripped open, her collarbone and five ribs were fractured, and she suffered serious internal injuries, but she survived. She was told that she would be reliant on a wheelchair for the rest of her life, and would never bear children.

Over the next few years, Shepherd recovered. While still remaining a partial paraplegic, she was ultimately able to walk again, and has three children. She gained her pilots license within a year of the accident, and went on to gain a commercial pilot&#x27;s licence, then an instructor&#x27;s license, eventually becoming a trained aerobatics flying instructor. She also became the first female director of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

Shepherd has written six books about her experiences. The first, &quot;Never Tell Me Never&quot; was made into a successful telemovie, with Shepherd being played by Claudia Karvan. She also has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Human Movement/Education.

Shepherd was a torchbearer at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. Shepherd took up dressage in an attempt to represent Australia at the 2004 Summer Paralympics.

Shepherd is an ambassador for Spinal Cure Australia, and was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2001 for her service to the community, her inspiration and her work in raising awareness of spinal cord research.

 In 1998, Shepherd was also awarded the title of an Outstanding Young Persons of the World, one of ten young people recognised annually by the Junior Chamber International. Shepherd is currently completing a PhD at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. Her research is in the area of resilience, disability and positive psychology.

<text>Clouddead (styled as cLOUDDEAD) was an American experimental hip hop group, consisting of Doseone (Adam Drucker), Why? (Yoni Wolf) and Odd Nosdam (David Madson).

The group&#x27;s name came from a nonsensical knock-knock joke Drucker&#x27;s sister told him when she was five years old.

==Style==
Clouddead&#x27;s sound is notoriously hard to define, and although it is undoubtedly grounded in &quot;traditional&quot; hip-hop, influences as varied as ambient, electronica, psychedelic music, and indie rock can be heard.

==History==
Clouddead&#x27;s first six 10-inch singles were compiled as a self-titled album, &quot;Clouddead&quot;, in 2001.

Printed on the sleeve of the single &quot;Dead Dogs Two&quot; is &quot;this is cLOUDDEAD number 9 of ten,&quot; indicating that as of &quot;Ten&quot; (2004), Clouddead have finished making music as a group.

<text>Lewis Gilbert (6 March 1920 – 23 February 2018) was an English film director, producer and screenwriter who directed more than 40 films during six decades; among them such varied titles as &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956), &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; (1960), &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983) and &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989), as well as three James Bond films: &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) and &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979).

==Early life==
Lewis Gilbert was born as Louis Laurie Isaacs in Clapton, London, to a second-generation family of music hall performers, and spent his early years travelling with his parents, Ada (Griver), who was of Jewish descent, and George Gilbert, and watching the shows from the wings. He first performed on stage at the age of five, when asked to drive a trick car around the stage. This pleased the audience, so this became the finale of his parents&#x27; act. When travelling on trains, his parents frequently hid him in the luggage rack, to avoid paying a fare for him. His father contracted tuberculosis as a young man and died aged 34, when Gilbert was seven.

Gilbert was a child actor in the 1920s and 1930s, but soon after the death of his father, his mother was unable to financially support him, while she was a film extra, and this led to Gilbert being taken in by his aunt Daisy Gilbert, with frequent visits from his mother.

Daisy Gilbert was a known Vaudeville performer in the duo &quot;The Dancing Gilbert Sisters&quot;, who performed at venues such as the Hackney Empire, and Tivoli in Australia. And it was Daisy Gilbert&#x27;s husband Harry Rosen, who was a known retailer at the time, who helped Gilbert financially when he wanted to become a film director in the early stages of his career.

During this time Gilbert had many difficulties with his formal education, but In 1933, at the age of 13, he had a role in Victor Hanbury and John Stafford&#x27;s &quot;Dick Turpin&quot;, and at age 17 a small uncredited role in &quot;The Divorce of Lady X&quot; (1938) opposite Laurence Olivier.

It was Daisy Gilbert, who helped him to get the role in &quot;The Divorce of Lady X,&quot; with the intention that Gilbert would be credited for it.

Later Alexander Korda offered to send him to RADA, but Gilbert chose to study direction instead, assisting Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939).

When the Second World War started, he joined the Royal Air Force&#x27;s film unit, where he worked on various documentary films. He was eventually seconded to the First Motion Picture Unit of the U.S. Army Air Forces, where his commanding officer was William Keighley, an American film director, who allowed Gilbert to take on much of his film-making work.

==Directorial career==
After the war, he continued to write and direct documentary shorts for Gaumont British, before entering low budget feature film production. Gilbert made his name as a director in the 1950s and 1960s with a series of successful films, often working as the film&#x27;s writer and producer as well. These films were often based on true stories from the Second World War. Examples include &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956) (based on the life of air ace Douglas Bader), &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot; (1958) (the story of SOE agent Violette Szabo) and &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; (1960).

===&quot;Alfie&quot;===
Gilbert directed &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966) starring Michael Caine. Gilbert&#x27;s wife Hylda discovered the play by Bill Naughton when she visited the hair salon and sat next to an actress who was in a production. Upon seeing the play, Hylda urged Gilbert to make it into a film. Gilbert used the technique of having the lead character speak directly to the viewer, a technique he later also used in &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989). Gilbert said &quot;Alfie&quot; was only made because the low budget was &quot;the sort of money Paramount executives normally spend on cigar bills&quot;. The film won the Jury Special Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Gilbert was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Director.

In 1967, Gilbert was chosen to direct Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical version of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, but he was already contracted to another project and had to pull out; he recommended Carol Reed, who took over. &quot;It was the lowest point in my life,&quot; said Gilbert. &quot;I&#x27;d developed &quot;Oliver!&quot; with Lionel Bart. I had to do &quot;The Adventurers&quot; instead... While doing this film, I signed to do &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Because of their financial problems, Paramount could only find $2m to make it. I said it needed $7m&quot;. So, instead, Gilbert made &quot;Friends&quot; (1971 movie).

===James Bond===
Although known for character dramas, Gilbert directed three of the James Bond films. After some reluctance, he was persuaded by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli to direct &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967). He turned down the opportunity to direct &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. Gilbert returned to the series in the 1970s to make &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) and &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979). After the high production costs of &quot;Moonraker&quot; and the financial failure of Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, United Artists was unable to afford to hire him to direct the next Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

===Later career===
In the 1980s, he returned to more small-scale dramas with film versions of Willy Russell&#x27;s plays &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983) and &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989). Gilbert also directed the film &quot;Stepping Out&quot; (1991).

Gilbert was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1997 Birthday Honours for services to the film industry. In 2001, Gilbert was made a Fellow of the British Film Institute, the highest accolade in the British film industry.

In June 2010, he appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. In it, he said that his 1970 film &quot;The Adventurers&quot; was a disaster, and that he should never have made it. On working with Orson Welles on &quot;Ferry to Hong Kong&quot;, he said that it was: &quot;dreadful, it was my nightmare film. It was a dreadful film, and everything was wrong with it; principally him [Welles].&quot; He also said that his biggest mistake was failing to direct the film version of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;. Its composer Lionel Bart had assured Gilbert that nobody else would do the film, but Gilbert was contractually committed to Paramount to make a film (that he has since refused to name), which caused him to withdraw from the project.

==Personal life==
Gilbert was married to Hylda Tafler for 53 years, until her death in June 2005. They had a son, Stephen, and raised another, John, hers from a prior relationship.

&quot;All My Flashbacks: The Autobiography of Lewis Gilbert, Sixty Years a Film Director&quot; was published by Reynolds &amp; Hearn in 2010.

Gilbert died at home in Monaco on 23 February 2018, 11 days shy of his 98th birthday.

<text>D&#x27;Hoffryn is a fictional character on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, played by Andy Umberger. He is a powerful entity high in the demonic hierarchy. He is the master of the vengeance demons, a cabal which includes humans who are &quot;elevated&quot; to demonic status and endowed with mystical powers enabling them to invoke revenge at the behest of mortals who believe they have been wronged. D&#x27;Hoffryn rules over a hell dimension known as Arashmahaar.

D&#x27;Hoffryn also appears in the comic books during the ninth season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and acts as the main antagonist of the tenth season.

==Character History==
===Television===
During the Dark Ages in Sweden a young woman named Aud comes to the attention of D&#x27;Hoffryn. Aud has recently used magic to turn her cheating boyfriend into a troll. (The character Aud is recognizable as Anya; her name is pronounced &quot;odd&quot;—this is a play on the fact that people are always telling Anya she is odd.) Impressed by her imaginative revenge, D&#x27;Hoffryn offers her a position as a vengeance demon, and she becomes &quot;Anyanka,&quot; an avenger of scorned women. When Anyanka, under the guise of Anya, is robbed of her powers by Giles while attempting to exact vengeance on behalf of Cordelia, D&#x27;Hoffryn refuses to help her, leaving Anya stuck in a teenage body. In season 4, D&#x27;Hoffryn attempts to convince Willow to become a vengeance demon after Oz leaves her and a spell she casts goes awry, resulting in a series of disasters for her friends which D&#x27;Hoffryn assumes she has done on purpose. She declines, but D&#x27;Hoffryn leaves his talisman (a tool to summon him) in case she changes her mind.

In season 6, D&#x27;Hoffryn is a guest at the failed wedding of Anya and Xander. After Xander leaves Anya at the altar, D&#x27;Hoffryn reinstates her powers and the grief-stricken Anya once again becomes a vengeance demon.

Anya&#x27;s second stint as a vengeance demon in season 7 proves short-lived, and after wreaking a terrible vengeance on several college males using a spider-like Grimslaw demon, Buffy confronts and fights her. Willow uses the talisman D&#x27;Hoffryn had given her to summon him, asking him to help put a stop to the fighting. D&#x27;Hoffryn asks Anya what she wants, and she says that she wants to reverse the vengeance she had done. D&#x27;Hoffryn grants her wish, telling her that it&#x27;ll require the sacrifice of a vengeance demon&#x27;s body and soul. Believing she is about to die, Anya is resigned to her fate only to watch helplessly as D&#x27;Hoffryn summons her friend Halfrek - another vengeance demon whose specialty is granting the wishes of unhappy children - and incinerates her instead. D&#x27;Hoffryn then leaves, disgusted with Anya. Episodes later, D&#x27;Hoffryn sends at least two demons to kill Anya, but they are both thwarted.

===Literature===
D&#x27;Hoffryn returns in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot; as a member of Illyria&#x27;s magic council bent on protecting whatever remains of magic following the destruction of the Seed of Wonder last season.

D&#x27;Hoffryn returns in &quot;Season Ten&quot; as the season&#x27;s Big Bad. He starts working alongside the Scoobies to help facilitate the new rules of magic only to double-cross them in favour of keeping the Slayer Handbook for himself. Empowered by the Slayer Handbook, D&#x27;Hoffryn annihilates the demon lords opposing Buffy in addition to other members of the magic council, removing his rivals for conquest of the world. He is assisted by the resurrected Anya and Jonathan Levinson which he transformed into a Vengeance demon before leading an attack on the Scooby Gang. However, Anya betrays D&#x27;Hoffryn to save Xander, and is then killed by D&#x27;Hoffryn, at which point Jonathan and the other vengeance demons abandon him to be slain by Buffy.

<text>Taipei Main Station () is a major metro and railway station in the capital Taipei, Taiwan. It is served by Taipei Metro, the Taiwan High Speed Rail, and Taiwan Railway. It is also connected through underground passageways to the terminal station of Taoyuan Airport MRT and the Taipei Bus Station. It is the busiest station in Taiwan.

==Station overview==

The central building of Taipei Main Station is a rectangular building in Zhongzheng District with six stories above ground and four stories below ground. The building is long and wide. The first floor has a large ticketing hall with a skylight and three ground-level exits in each cardinal direction, the second is occupied by restaurants managed by the Breeze group, and all floors above are office spaces. At the B1 level, there are turnstiles for the TR and THSR platforms, along with a myriad of underground passageways for Taipei Bus Station, the Taoyuan Metro station, and Beimen metro station.

==HSR services==
HSR services 1xx, (1)2xx, (1)3xx, (1)5xx, (1)6xx, and (8)8xx call at this station. The first two southbound trains in the day are 803 (stops at all stations) at 06:26 and 203 (Taipei-Banqiao-Taichung-Chiayi-Tainan-Zuoying) at 06:30. Service 203 is the only train of the day that departs from Taipei Station, and does not depart from Nangang station like most southbound trains do. Although Service 203 departs four minutes later after Service 803, passengers traveling to major cities such as Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung will save more time taking Train No. 203, while Train No. 803 would be more suitable for traveling to nearby cities such as Taoyuan or Hsinchu.

==History==
The first rail station in Taipei was completed in Twatutia in 1891, during Qing rule, when the railway to Keelung was opened for service. Initially, a temporary station was built while a permanent station was constructed in 1897, during Japanese rule (1895–1945). In 1901, the station was located to the east of its current location. It was rebuilt in 1940 to accommodate growing passenger traffic.

To alleviate traffic congestion caused by railroad crossings in downtown Taipei, an underground railway tunnel between Huashan and Wanhua was built along with the present station building as part of the Taipei Railway Underground Project. When the underground system was completed on 2 September 1989, railway service was moved to the newly completed building (completed on 5 September 1989) and the old building as well as a temporary station were demolished.

The current station was further expanded with the opening of the Taipei Metro. The metro station is connected to the basement of the railway station and opened to passenger traffic in 1997 to the Tamsui–Xinyi line. It became a massive transfer hub with the opening of the Bannan Line in 1999. Extensive underground malls now exist at the front and back of the station, which emulate those found in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. The station also became a terminus for Taiwan High Speed Rail trains when the network began service in 2007.

===Ongoing developments===
Taipei station and the area surrounding it have been undergoing renovation since 2005. Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki was chosen to design two skyscrapers that will surround the railroad station. Maki will also oversee the renovation of Taipei station. The height of the taller tower will be 76 stories, whereas the shorter tower will be 56 stories. The two skyscrapers will be constructed on empty parcels found adjacent to Taipei station, above the Taoyuan Airport MRT station.

The station interior underwent renovation work from February to October 2011. Basement restrooms were renovated, the basement and first floor preparations for additional Breeze Plaza retail space began, the large ticket office in the first floor lobby was removed, and additional retail space was allocated. In addition, the flooring on the first floor was completely replaced, fire and evacuation regulations were improved, and solar panels will be installed on the station roof.

<text>Stöð 2 (literally Station 2) is an Icelandic subscription television channel, owned and operated by Sýn. Founded in 1986, it was the first privately owned television station in Iceland following the lifting of the state monopoly on television broadcasting. Sister channels under the Stöð 2 name include Stöð 2 Sport and Stöð 2 Bíó. Stöð 2 is the second-oldest private television station in the Nordic countries, after MTV3 in Finland.

==History==
===New media laws of 1986===
During the big BSRB strike in the fall of 1984, almost all of RÚV&#x27;s activities shut down and several illegal radio stations sprung up. As a result, consideration was given to revising the broadcasting laws during the tenure of Minister of Education Ragnhildar Helgadóttir. A new law, which allowed private radio and television stations, was approved by Alþingi on June 13, 1985, and came into effect at the beginning of 1986. Until that time, there had been two radio stations and one television station operating in Iceland, Rás 1 and Rás 2 and Ríkissjónvarpið.

===Start of Stöð 2===
Stöð 2 went on the air on October 9 that same year as a subscription station with a scrambled program where the subscriber had to buy a code number and enter a video code to unscramble the broadcast. Television presenter Jón Óttar and Vala Matt were prominent on the screen during the first days of the station. The line-up was made up of imported entertainment, dramatized Icelandic entertainment and news. It was difficult to get investors to participate in the activity to begin with. At the beginning of 1987, there were about five thousand subscribers, but by the end of the year there had been almost thirty thousand. At the same time, the number of employees increased and the station began to compete with RÚV for programmers and reporters, which was considered unheard of.

===Unification of the brand===
Many sister stations were operated under the same company, but in 2008 they were all united under the name of Stöð 2, thus the sports station Sýn became Stöð 2 Sport. Sirkus became Stöð 2 Extra and Fjölvarpið became Stöð 2 Fjölvarp, on the other hand, Stöð 2 Bíó kept its name.

<doc id="959066" wikidata="Q1377699" url="?curid=959066" title="Tsukuba Express">
<text>The , or TX, is a Japanese railway line operated by the third-sector company Metropolitan Intercity Railway Company, which links Akihabara Station in Chiyoda, Tokyo and Tsukuba Station in Tsukuba, Ibaraki. The route was inaugurated on 24 August 2005.

==History==

The was founded on 15 March 1991 to construct the Tsukuba Express, which was then provisionally called the . The new line was planned to relieve crowding on the Jōban Line operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), which had reached the limit of its capacity. However, with the economic downturn in Japan, the goal shifted to development along the line. This was facilitated by the enactment of the Special Measures Law in September 1989 which allowed the expedition of large housing projects as well as the expansion and construction of new and existing railway lines.

During the early stages of construction, the construction company (Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency, or JRTT) as well as associated keiretsu and associates in the public sector purchased land situated on the alignment of the route. Eventually, all the lots would be joined continuously, completed or not, and their ownership transferred to the eventual railway operator, MIRC. Construction of all stations were centered around the theme of universal design.

Also, the initial plan called for a line from Tokyo Station to Moriya, but expenses forced the planners to start the line at Akihabara instead of Tokyo Station, and pressure from the government of Ibaraki Prefecture resulted in moving the extension from Moriya to Tsukuba into Phase I of the construction.

The original schedule called for the line to begin operating in 2000, but delays in construction pushed the opening date to summer 2005. The line eventually opened on 24 August 2005.

From the start of the revised timetable on 15 October 2012, new services were introduced in the morning (inbound services) and evening (outbound services) peak periods.

=== Future plans ===
In September 2013, a number of municipalities along the Tsukuba Express line in Ibaraki Prefecture submitted a proposal to complete the extension of the line to Tokyo Station at the same time as a new airport-to-airport line proposed as part of infrastructure improvements for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

On 31 March 2023, four proposals for possible northern extensions were submitted to Ibaraki Prefecture governor Kazuhiko Ōigawa. The proposals included plans to extend the line to either:

* Tsuchiura Station on the Joban Line
* Ibaraki Airport
* Mito (via Ishioka Station) on the Joban Line
* Mount Tsukuba

According to the proposals, the plan for the extension to Tsuchiura Station produced the most favourable cost-benefit analysis.

==Driving==
The Tsukuba Express is operated as a one-man (conductorless) train. The driver opens and closes the doors manually, but operation of the train is done automatically. The line has a top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). The Rapid service reduced the time required for the trip from Akihabara to Tsukuba from the previous 1 hour 30 minutes (by the Jōban Line, arriving in Tsuchiura, about from Tsukuba) or 70 minutes (by bus, under optimal traffic conditions) to 45 minutes. From Tokyo, the trip takes 50–55 minutes. The line features no level crossings.

==Electrification and rolling stock==
To prevent interference with the geomagnetic measurements of the Japan Meteorological Agency at its laboratory in Ishioka, the portion of the line from Moriya to Tsukuba operates on alternating current. As a result, three train models are used on the line; TX-1000 series DC-only trains, which can operate only between Akihabara and Moriya, TX-2000 series and TX-3000 series dual-voltage AC/DC trains, both of which can operate over the entire line.

Volume production of the line&#x27;s initial rolling stock began in January 2004, following the completion in March 2003 of two (TX-1000 and TX-2000 series) six-car trains for trial operation and training. The full fleet of 84 TX-1000s (14 six-car trains) and 96 TX-2000s (16 six-car trains) was delivered by January 2005. New TX-3000 series trains built by Hitachi Rail entered service on 14 March 2020.

==Operation==
Metropolitan Intercity Railway Company offers four types of train services on the Tsukuba Express:
* : 
* : 

===Station list===
Trains stop at stations marked &quot;●&quot; and skip stations marked &quot;|&quot;. 

During the morning rush hour on weekdays, Semi Rapid trains bound for Akihabara make an additional stop at Rokuchō (marked &quot;▲&quot;).

<doc id="959072" wikidata="Q449104" url="?curid=959072" title="Lee Tamahori">
<text>Warren Lee Tamahori (; born 17 June 1950) is a New Zealand film director. His feature directorial debut, &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; (1994), was a widespread critical and commercial success, and is considered one of the greatest New Zealand films ever made. Subsequently, he has directed a variety of works both in his native country and in Hollywood, including the survival drama &quot;The Edge&quot; (1997), the Alex Cross thriller &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; (2001), the James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), the political biopic &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Double&quot; (2011), and the period drama &quot;Mahana&quot; (2016).

Tamahori won the New Zealand Film Award for Best Director for &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, with a second nomination for &quot;Mahana&quot;.

==Early life==
Tamahori was born in Wellington, New Zealand. He is of Māori ancestry on his father&#x27;s side and British on his mother&#x27;s. He grew up in Tawa, a northern suburb of Wellington. Educated at Tawa School and Tawa College, he began his career as a commercial artist and photographer.

==Career==
=== Early work ===
Tamahori moved into the film industry the late 1970s, getting the door working for nothing, then working as a boom operator for Television New Zealand, and on the feature films &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot;, &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, and &quot;Race for the Yankee Zephyr&quot;. 

In the early 1980s &quot;Pork Pie&quot; director Geoff Murphy promoted Tamahori to become an assistant director on &quot;Utu&quot;, and he subsequently worked as first assistant director on &quot;The Silent One&quot;, Murphy&#x27;s &quot;The Quiet Earth&quot;, &quot;Came a Hot Friday &quot;and &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence&quot;. In 1986 Tamahori co-founded production company Flying Fish, which specialised in making commercials. Tamahori made his name with a series of high-profile television commercials, including one awarded &#x27;Commercial of the Decade&#x27;.

===Feature films===
Tamahori had directed a number of shorter dramas for television before he made his feature film debut in 1994 with &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, a gritty depiction of a violent Māori family. The film had problems finding funding, but it went on to break box office records in New Zealand. Overseas it sold to many countries and won rave reviews from &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;The Melbourne Age&quot;, with &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;Première&quot; naming it one of the ten best films of the year.

Tamahori moved to Hollywood and directed the period crime drama &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot; (1996), although this was not received well critically or commercially. This was followed by the successful wilderness film &quot;The Edge&quot; (1997), which starred Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin and &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), the twentieth and most successful James Bond film made up until that point. He also directed an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and the thriller &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; (2001).

Tamahori&#x27;s next film was the sequel to &quot;XXX&quot; (2002), titled &quot;&quot; (2005), starring Ice Cube and Willem Dafoe; he replaced the original film&#x27;s director, Rob Cohen. In 2007 he directed &quot;Next&quot;, a science fiction action film based on &quot;The Golden Man&quot;, a short story by Philip K. Dick. The film starred Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore and Jessica Biel. The drama &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Double&quot; starring Dominic Cooper was released in 2011, a dramatisation of Latif Yahia&#x27;s claims that he was forced to become body double to Uday Hussein, son of Saddam.

In 2012 Tamahori was attached to the action epic &quot;Emperor&quot;, about a young woman seeking revenge for the execution of her father by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Adrien Brody was cast in 2014 as the Emperor opposite Sophie Cookson as the young woman, also cast in 2014. The film is unfinished and its release has been by legal challenges.

In 2015, Tamahori directed &quot;Mahana&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Patriarch&quot;), his first feature made in New Zealand since &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;. The rural-set drama was based on the novel &quot;Bulibasha&quot; by Witi Ihimaera, and starred Temuera Morrison, whom he had earlier directed in &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;. The movie was released in New Zealand in March 2016, after debuting at the Berlin Film Festival.

In 2022, Tamahori directed the historical drama &quot;The Convert,&quot; starring Guy Pearce and Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne.

==Personal life==
Tamahori has been married twice and has two sons, one from each marriage.

=== Legal issues ===
In January 2006, Tamahori was arrested on Santa Monica Boulevard when, according to Los Angeles police, he entered an undercover policeman&#x27;s car while wearing a woman&#x27;s dress and offered to perform a sex act in exchange for money. In February 2006, he pleaded no contest in a Los Angeles court to a charge of criminal trespass in return for prosecutors dropping charges of prostitution and loitering. He was placed on 36 months&#x27; probation and ordered to perform 15 days of community service.

<doc id="959075" wikidata="Q2555845" url="?curid=959075" title="Steam Detectives">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kia Asamiya. The manga was originally serialized in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot; and later moved to &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; at the magazines start. It was later adapted into a 26-episode anime television series which ran from October 1998 to March 1999 on TV Tokyo. In North America, the anime is licensed by ADV Films and the manga by Viz Media.

==Plot==
Steam City is a place where the only fuel source is coal, and the only means to produce energy is the steam engine. As the only source of energy, the steam engine has been the focus of technological advancement to the point where it can be substituted for any other form of power in modern technology. These same advancements also have given rise to Megamatons, large steam-powered robots. With the air of Steam City thick with fog and white smoke, thieves and criminals flourish with Megamatons as a common tool in their nefarious plans. It is here that the reader and/or viewer finds Narutaki, a young detective fighting for the peace of the city.

==Characters==
:
:Son of the greatest detective in Steam City, Narutaki takes up the mantle after his parents&#x27; death. He is considered by some a child genius, but an annoyance by others. He is compassionate, and sometimes naive in his attitude towards both his citizen charges and the villains he pursues. Narutaki loves Steam City and vows to protect it from danger. His investigation style is similar to Sherlock Holmes. He uses a multi-purpose gun and various tools to aid his investigations. Despite his young age, he drinks tea and has an eye for pretty ladies. He also has a passion for toy models, and is described as &quot;precocious&quot; by Ling Ling.
:
:Ling Ling is the youngest daughter of Dr. Hsu and the writer Feifer. A young nurse who owns the Megamaton, Goriki. She and Goriki become assistants of Narutaki after being tricked into helping Night Phantom. Much of her past is a mystery. She helps Narutaki in his investigations and looks after his health. Ling Ling is sensitive and caring to others but she can rise to the occasion. Her overly sentimental nature does put her in danger when she throws herself into things. She volunteers at the local hospitals since they are often understaffed. It is hinted in the manga that she may have feelings for Narutaki.
:
:The Narutaki family butler and mechanic, he is the primary caretaker of Narutaki. Kawakubo also repairs Goriki. Kawakubo was the butler for Narutaki&#x27;s father and is familiar with the older cases. He assists Narutaki in his lab work and research. He also manages Narutaki&#x27;s affairs and looks after the house and its occupants.
:
:The last Megamaton built by Dr. Hsu, Goriki means &quot;great strength&quot;. According to the last wishes of the doctor, Dr. Hsu&#x27;s brain is implanted inside Goriki&#x27;s body. Unlike most Megamatons, Goriki does not need to be remote controlled. He provides the brunt of Narutaki Detective Agency&#x27;s strength. He is capable of understanding speech and appears to respond to Ling Ling&#x27;s emotions. Goriki is always ready to battle despite the reluctance of Ling Ling.
:
:His true identity is Dr. Hart, a rival scientist of Dr. Hsu. He considers Dr. Hsu his enemy, and wishes to prove himself as the best. The pair disagreed on how Megamaton technology should be used. He often attacks Steam City with advanced Megamatons. He aims to rule the world with the aid of his Megamatons.
:
:A detective with the Steam City Police Department, he is a good detective but can be a little over the top. He resents Narutaki&#x27;s involvement in the cases. He is also very open about his love for Ling Ling, which is not returned.
:
:Chief Inspector Yagami is Narutaki’s most trusted friend in the police force. He is not afraid of asking help from Narutaki, he also provides Narutaki with information pertaining to cases. He likes to think things through when solving a case.
:
:&quot;Phantom Knight&quot; in the manga. A mysterious villain who has a past and a grudge with Narutaki and Narutaki&#x27;s father. His father, the previous Phantom Knight, killed Narutaki&#x27;s parents. He hates Steam City and vows to destroy it so he can avenge his father. Unlike most villains, he often creates elaborate plans to trick and kill Narutaki. His design and personality draw parallels to Batman.
:
:A female thief who loves precious gems and jewellery. She often uses trickery and illusion to steal her prizes. She is very adept at disguising herself, which is a useful skill used for cat burglary. She also dislikes being called &#x27;old&#x27;.
:
:A mechanic otaku, he steals items that are mechanical in nature. He is obsessed with Goriki and comes across more as comic relief or as a sweet loser rather than a true villain. He wears a metal mask with only his left eye exposed and has an army of mechanical henchmen who don’t always follow orders.
:
:A criminal mastermind whose intelligence is equal to Narutaki, he often sets up cat-and-mouse games against the young detective and the Steam City police. Le Bled steals priceless and rare items in the belief that he is the only one to appreciate them. It is later revealed that he suffers from an incurable terminal illness and steals to live life to the fullest. Although he is a thief, he has a sense of honor. Le Bled bears a scar from a confrontation with Narutaki. He resides in a castle far away from Steam City and seems to be quite rich.
:
:Ling Ling&#x27;s older sister, she is the partner and lover of Le Bled. Unlike Ling Ling, she seems to have a disdain for helping the sick. She wears black as a sign of mourning for the patients that she has killed to end their suffering. Lang Lang looks after Le Bled and helps in his thefts. She worries that Le Bled is pushing himself too far and cares for him to the best of her ability. She inherited the design for Dr. Hsu’s last Megamaton Hiroh, which she had built for Le Bled.

===Minor characters===
; and 
:Crimson Scorpion&#x27;s henchmen, they are more cautious than their boss but follow her orders without question.
:A police officer who transferred from Electrical City so she could meet Narutaki. She is tall and good looking.
:
:A scientist in energy technology, he repairs and maintains Goriki at his factory.
:
:Narutaki&#x27;s father, and the previous owner of Narutaki Detective Agency. He is Narutaki&#x27;s role model and was considered the best detective in Steam City. He and his wife lost their lives during an encounter with the original Night Phantom.
; and 
:Two criminals from Techland that sometimes appear in Steam City to steal blueprints of new technologies to advance Techland&#x27;s own power. Their well thought-out plans are generally ruined either by Narutaki or at times by their own carelessness.
:A giant hamster that Ling Ling brought home one day. It understands human speech and is adept at overpowering humans.

<text>The first and original incarnation of Walt Disney Television was an American production company and the original/former television production division of the Walt Disney Company, which was active from 1983 to 2003.

Productions from this division were broadcast mostly on Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD and ABC. Majority of productions from this division are a plethora of animated series and a notable live-action series named &quot;Smart Guy&quot;, the latter which ran for three seasons on The WB from 1997 to 1999.

In 2003, its animation division, then known as Walt Disney Television Animation (currently just Disney Television Animation) spun-out as its own subsidiary within the larger Disney conglomerate, with an acquired production company, It&#x27;s a Laugh Productions, taking over its operations for live-action productions. Walt Disney Television itself was absorbed into the first incarnation of Touchstone Television, which changed names to ABC Studios in 2007, ABC Signature Studios in 2013 and currently ABC Signature since 2020. Following the completed acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019, Disney returned to using this name for its combined television segment for 2 years before they subtly changed name to Disney General Entertainment Content, with Disney Television Studios established on May 15, 2019.

==Background==
While initially not interest in television back in the 1930s, Walt Disney changed his mind seeing television at least as a promotional tool. Most studios were generating revenue by selling off their permanent television rights to their films made before 1948, while Disney held on to the company&#x27;s film rights. Thus Walt Disney Productions was the first of the film industry, which saw television as an adversary, to enter the television production field. Walt Disney Productions did an hour-long special on Christmas Day 1950 for NBC then in 1951 for CBS. The specials used Disney film clips, short films and promoted the upcoming &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; theatrical film. Both specials had excellent ratings. The networks pursued Disney to do a full series for them. Disney used this interest in a series to request funding for Disneyland, with the newly merged American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres taking the deal for the airing of the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Disneyland&quot; anthology series in American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The &quot;Operation Undersea&quot; episode of the series garnered Disney its first Emmy Award. The series quickly became ABC&#x27;s first series to hit the top 20 in ratings.

Disney&#x27;s entry into television impacted the television industry as the Disney anthology show marked a move from live to filmed delivery of television shows. Filming made it possible for higher production value. Also, a couple of the major film studios copied the show&#x27;s format with &quot;MGM Parade&quot; and &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot;. Both shows did not last.

With the series&#x27; &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; episodes generating high sale of merchandise, Disney Productions produced &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, the first youth audience television program and a daily afternoon show. In 1957, Disney was producing the series &quot;Zorro&quot;. It lasted until 1959. In 1961, Disney severed its terms with ABC and moved its weekly program to NBC, where it stayed for nearly 20 years until 1981. For years, its anthology series was Disney&#x27;s lone program on network television. In 1972, it collaborated with the NBC owned-and-operated stations group to launch &quot;The Mouse Factory&quot;. It didn&#x27;t last long, and it was canned in 1973.

In 1975, Disney launched a partnership with SFM Media Service Corporation to distribute &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; onto syndication starting in 1975, leading up to new episodes in 1977.

In 1980, Disney severed its exclusive deal with NBC, and jumped into line as a production company for television programs. The following year, it signed a production agreement with CBS to bring anthology series to the network, and the addition of producing new original programs. Disney had broken its 23-year streak of producing anthology series only in order to produce its first TV show since &quot;Zorro&#x27;&quot;s cancellation in 1982, &quot;Herbie the Love Bug&quot;, which only lasted one season on CBS. This was followed by three short-lived sitcoms produced &quot;Gun Shy&quot;, &quot;Small &amp; Frye&quot; and &quot;Zorro and Son&quot;, which also aired on CBS, but never lasted long, which led to the demise of the anthology series in 1983.

==History==
Walt Disney Television was formed in 1983, as the Walt Disney Pictures Television Division, the name was later shortened to Walt Disney Television in 1988. Until 1983, Disney shows were aired under the banner of the parent company, then named Walt Disney Productions. Disney made its firsts in 1985, which are &quot;Wildside&quot;, which is produced under the Touchstone Films label (later Touchstone Television, ABC Studios, and ABC Signature), and two animated cartoons &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; on CBS and &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; on NBC.

In August 1994, with the departure of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, its filmed entertainment business was split into two, with Walt Disney Pictures continuing with motion pictures and the newly created Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications for television under Joe Roth and Richard Frank respectively.

At the time when Disney merged with Capital Cities/ABC, Disney Television was a part of Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications (WDTT). With the retirement of WDTT president Dennis Hightower in April 1996 and ongoing post-merger reorganization, Walt Disney Television (along with its Animation unit) was transferred back to The Walt Disney Studios.

The Walt Disney Television group, upon the departure of its president Dean Valentine in September 1997, was split into two units: Walt Disney Television (WDT) and Walt Disney Network Television (WDNT), reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth. WDT would be headed by Charles Hirschhorn as president and consisted of Disney Telefilms for ABC, the-direct-to video-unit, and Walt Disney Television Animation. WDNT would handle primetime programming, headed by David Neuman as president. Neuman was also named president of Touchstone Television. In March 1998, WDNT was placed under Buena Vista TV Productions, a newly formed group under chairman Lloyd Braun, along with Touchstone Television. in June 1998, Neuman left as did his top two executives due to this reorganization.

In late 1999, Walt Disney Television Studios (also called Buena Vista Television Group or Buena Vista Television Productions), were transferred from the Disney Studios to the ABC Television Network to merge with ABC&#x27;s primetime division, ABC Entertainment, forming the ABC Entertainment Television Group. Walt Disney Television Studios was later merged into Touchstone Television (became ABC Studios, now known as ABC Signature) in 2000, while its name continued to be used on new cartoons from Walt Disney Television Animation (now Disney Television Animation, which is now a unit of Disney Channels Worldwide) until 2003, when Disney later merged the television production company with the television animation division and Touchstone Television (now ABC Signature)

==Disney Telefilms==
Disney Telefilms (DTF), or Walt Disney Telefilms, was a TV film production company and a division of Walt Disney Television. The division provided movies for &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

===History===
With the purchase of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Disney CEO Michael Eisner wanted to relaunch &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; on ABC in 1996 with a movie franchise. Walt Disney Telefilms was formed to produce films for the anthology TV series by 1995. Leah Keith was transferred from Walt Disney Pictures that year to the telefilms division.

Hollywood Pictures executive vice president Charles Hirschhorn oversaw Walt Disney Telefilms as president in June 1996, reporting to Dean Valentine, president of Walt Disney Television and Walt Disney Television Animation, for the Telefilms unit. Mike Karz, a former vice president of Mandeville Films, signed a first look deal with the company through his shingle, Karz Entertainment, based at Walt Disney Studios in May 1997. On September 28, 1997, the division launched the anthology show. The division produced 17 films in nine months while it only expected to provide 16 movies. On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms&#x27; first production, &quot;Toothless&quot;, debuted on &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

The Walt Disney Television group, upon the departure of Dean Valentine in September 1997, was split into two units: Walt Disney Television (WDT) and Walt Disney Network Television (WDNT). WDT would be headed by Hirschhorn as president and consisted of Disney Telefilms and Walt Disney Television Animation, including Disney MovieToons/Disney Video Premiere. Leah Keith and Peter Green were promoted to production vice presidents for the division in March 1998.

<text>Dadaocheng is an area in Datong District, Taipei, Taiwan. It was also known as Twatutia (a transliteration of the Taiwanese Hokkien &quot;Tuā-tiū-tiânn&quot;), Daitōtei during Japanese rule, and Tataocheng (Mandarin) during the Kuomintang era.

Dadaocheng was an important trading port in the 19th century, and is still a major historical tourist attraction and shopping area. The district is known for the local Taiwanese cuisine, the Chien-Cheng Circle, and also being the center of the February 28 Incident.

==History==
When the export of tea became important in northern Taiwan in the mid-19th century, many businessmen appeared at Twatutia. The first shop opened in 1851, belonging to Lin Lan-tian (林藍田), a native of Keelung. Lin opened three shops that he later called &quot;Lim Ek-sun&quot; (林益順). Foreigners entered the trade in 1867 and five British firms had been established at Twatutia by 1872.

In 1853, many people moved into the area from Bangka following a serious conflict.

The first rail station in Taipei was completed in Twatutia in October 1891, when the railway to Keelung was opened for service. The branch line from Taihoku (Taipei) to Tamsui was completed in June 1901, and (大稻埕車站) opened as part of the then TRA Tamsui Line. However, it was closed to passenger service in 1916 and continued to operate as a freight-only station until its eventual closure in 1937.

In the early 20th century, Daitotei was considered a part of the Taihoku area outside of the city proper, and was where European settlers lived. It stretched northward along the Tamsui River, which flows down to the port, a distance of about . Daitotei was the second most populous city in Taiwan (second to Tainan and followed by &quot;Banka&quot;) with a population of thirty to forty thousand. In 1920, it became part of the newly incorporated Taihoku City under Taihoku Prefecture.

Daitotei was the location for one of the first movie theaters built for the Taiwanese audience during Japanese rule. The interior structure of Eraku-za imitated the Imperial Theater in Tokyo and included a café, a gymnasium and dressing rooms. Also, during the Japanese rule it was used as one of the sites for The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule.

The most famous street in Dadaocheng was named Dihua Street after World War II and is the oldest street in Taipei. There are many stores selling dried goods and snacks, especially before the Lunar New Year. Taipei Xia-Hai City God Temple (大稻埕霞海城隍廟) is also on Dihua Street. There is a festival to celebrate the birthday of Xiahai Cheng Huang (City God) on the 13th day of the 5th lunar month every year.

<text>Walt Disney Records is an American record label owned by the Disney Music Group. The label releases soundtrack albums from the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s motion picture studios, television shows, theme parks and traditional studio albums produced by its roster of pop, teen pop and country artists.

The music label was founded on February 4, 1956 as Disneyland Records. Before that time, Disney recordings were licensed to a variety of other labels such as RCA, Decca, Capitol, ABC-Paramount, and United Artists. It was Disney Legend Jimmy Johnson who convinced Walt Disney’s brother Roy O. Disney that Disney, at time known as &quot;Walt Disney Productions&quot; should form their own record label. It adopted its current name in 1988 and is currently distributed by Universal Music Group for physical releases outside of North America and digital releases globally.

== History ==
Disneyland Records was predicated by non-soundtrack audio material based on Davy Crockett miniseries from the Disneyland anthology television series, along with the song, &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett,&quot; both featuring series star Fess Parker. These were licensed to Columbia Records, but the smaller Cadence Records label released the more successful &quot;Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot; sung by Bill Hayes faster, and this was the record that topped the charts instead. The following year, Disney saw profits for Mickey Mouse Club records in the millions being shared with Golden Records and ABC Records, finally convincing Roy to allow Johnson to start the in-house Disneyland Records.

=== Disneyland Records ===

The label was founded as Disneyland Records on February 4, 1956, with Jimmy Johnson as president, serving as the record unit of Walt Disney Productions. Johnson brought in musician Tutti Camarata to head the Artists and Repertoire department of this new enterprise. One ten-inch LP with the &quot;Disneyland&quot; imprint had been released a few months earlier, a musical version of &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot;, but it was distributed by the Charles Hansen music publishing company. The first album produced, marketed and distributed by the label was &quot;Walt Disney Takes You to Disneyland&quot;, the only album Walt had ever recorded especially for his own record company. Also in the first year, seven Disney animated movie soundtracks were issued by the label.

Disneyland Records issued Parker&#x27;s &quot;Wringle Wrangle&quot; single from the &quot;Westward Ho the Wagons!&quot; film within a year of starting operations; the single became a hit. This led the company to start recording music from outside the films. However, what ever was released by the company the industry categorized as children. Pricing was directed towards an adult audience, which was more than standard children fare. The only outside success was Camarata’s album &quot;Tutti&#x27;s Trumpets&quot;. Thus in 1959, the Disneyland label became the soundtrack and children&#x27;s label and Buena Vista label for the occasional pop song record.

Camarata established the label&#x27;s initial forays into long-form musical albums, which included jazz interpretations of Disney standards from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella&quot;, as well as original musical concept albums, and he expanded the format of soundtracks by including selections from the score as well as the songs. Tutti&#x27;s connections within the music industry also brought to the label the likes of Mary Martin, Louis Armstrong, Louis Prima and Phil Harris. After popular Mouseketeer, Annette Funicello, sang a song called &quot;How Will I Know My Love&quot; on the Mickey Mouse Club TV series, fans contacted the studio for the record, which became a minor hit. This prompted Camarata, Johnson and Walt Disney to encourage Annette&#x27;s career as the label&#x27;s first artist in residence. In 1959, the Buena Vista Records label was formed for Funicello&#x27;s select recordings, soundtrack albums and other contemporary audiophile music.

While looking for the right material for Annette, Tutti and his team discovered the songwriting duo of Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman after hearing one of their songs on the radio. The two were brought to the Disney studio in Burbank where they eventually became the first staff songwriters for the company.With the participation of the Sherman brothers and two technicians at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, Camarata developed his renowned &quot;Annette Sound,&quot; a specific type of double/reverb recording to strengthen Annette&#x27;s voice that became an industry standard. The Shermans penned not only a good deal of Annette&#x27;s songs, but were also responsible for most of the iconic Disney songs of the 1960s and beyond – “It&#x27;s a Small World” and “The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room” for the theme parks, as well as the songs from &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;.

In 1960, Camarata left the staff but under Roy O. Disney&#x27;s suggestion, established his own full-service recording studio where most of Disney and Buena Vista&#x27;s records were recorded, mixed, engineered, cut and mastered, the Los Angeles landmark, Sunset Sound. In effect he was associated with Disney until the early seventies. Disneyland Records started its read-along series in 1965 with singer/actor Robie Lester appearing on more titles than any other in the history of the label.

=== Disneyland/Vista Records ===

In 1971, Disneyland Records was renamed Disneyland/Vista Records. Also, &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot; was still in their line. Disneyland/Vista worked with Rankin/Bass to release six recordings tied to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; 1977 animated film. Rankin/Bass also had Disneyland/Vista release soundtracks for two of their earlier holiday specials, &quot;Frosty&#x27;s Winter Wonderland&quot; and &quot;’Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;.

The company was so successful with its &quot;Mickey Mouse Disco&quot; album that Disneyland looked to expand again into pop music by October 1980. Its success also lead to the issuance of animated theatrical shorts based on songs from the album. Two such original productions were &quot;That Waddlin&#x27; Crazy Guy&quot; and &quot;Pardners&quot; featuring the comedy singing team of Willio and Phillio (Will Ryan and Phil Baron).

=== Disneyland/Vista Records and Tapes ===

In 1985, the label was renamed Disneyland/Vista Records and Tapes.

Around 1987, the label began releasing their albums on CD. Some of the first albums that the label released on CD were The Disney Collection series.

=== Walt Disney Records ===
In 1988, Disneyland/Vista Records and Tapes was renamed Disney Records then Walt Disney Records.

Around 1990, Walt Disney Records signed several youth targeted acts like Parachute Express and Norman Foote. Disney let these acts go after several years as their mandate was changed to support the animated features, produce book and tape packages and compilations to take advantage of the catalog.

In May 2000, Walt Disney Records signed the label&#x27;s first teen singer, Myra; her first single with the label, &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;, was released on May 23, 2000 as part of the &quot;La Vida Mickey&quot; album.

On June 24, 2014, Walt Disney Records launched a series entitled &quot;The Legacy Collection.&quot; The series includes original soundtracks, as well as unreleased music, and composer and producer liner notes. As of 2022, the collection includes 16 albums ranging between various anniversaries of various Disney films and Disneyland.

With Disney&#x27;s purchase of Lucasfilm on December 21, 2012, Walt Disney Records became the official record label for the studio and all &quot;Star Wars&quot;-related soundtracks, beginning with &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; soundtrack on December 18, 2015. In January 2017, Disney acquired the distribution rights to the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; music catalog from Sony Classical; the soundtrack albums from the first six films were then released by Walt Disney Records in digital formats the same day. Disney reissued the digitally remastered original &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtrack albums in physical formats on May 4, 2018.

In 2024, Disney acquired the distribution rights to the first four &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; soundtrack albums from Concord Records; the soundtracks were then reissued by Walt Disney Records later that year. That same year, Walt Disney Records released &quot;A Whole New Sound&quot;, an album of pop-punk cover versions of classic songs from Disney films. The first single from the album, a cover of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; by Simple Plan, was released on July 12, 2024.

<doc id="959129" wikidata="Q3442939" url="?curid=959129" title="USS Decatur (DD-5)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Decatur&quot; was a in the United States Navy. She was named in honor of Stephen Decatur.

==Construction==
&quot;Decatur&quot; was launched on 26 September 1900 by William R. Trigg Company, Richmond, Virginia; sponsored by Miss M. D. Mayo, great-grandniece of Commodore Decatur; and commissioned on 19 May 1902.

==Pre-World War I==

&quot;Decatur&quot; was designated lead vessel of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla with which she conducted drills and maneuvers along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Caribbean until December 1903, when the flotilla departed Norfolk for the Asiatic Station, sailing by way of the Suez Canal.

Arriving at Cavite, Philippines, on 14 April 1904, &quot;Decatur&quot; exercised along the China coast and cruised in Philippine waters until placed in reserve at Cavite on 5 December 1905. For the next three years, she made infrequent cruises, including one to the southern Philippines in January–February 1908 and Saigon in May 1908.

&quot;Decatur&quot; ran aground on a sand bar in the Philippines on 7 July 1908 while under the command of Ensign Chester W. Nimitz. The ship was pulled free the next day, and Nimitz was court-martialed, found guilty of neglect of duty, and issued a letter of reprimand.

Placed out of commission on 18 February 1909, &quot;Decatur&quot; was placed in commission in reserve on 22 April 1910 and in full commission on 22 December. She resumed operations with the Torpedo Flotilla, cruising in the southern Philippines and between ports of China and Japan until on 1 August 1917, when she departed for the Mediterranean.

==World War I==

Assigned to US Patrol Squadrons, &quot;Decatur&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 20 October for patrol and convoy duty in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean until on 8 December 1918. &quot;Decatur&quot; arrived at Philadelphia on 6 February 1919 and was decommissioned there on 20 June. She was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company on 3 January 1920.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Lieutenant Lloyd Horwitz Chandler (19 May 1902 – 22 April 1904) (Later Rear Admiral)
* Lieutenant Dudley Wright Knox (22 April 1904 – 24 March 1906) (Later Commodore)
* Ensign Chester William Nimitz (1 July 1908 – 29 July 1908) (Later Fleet admiral and Chief of Naval Operations) – &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier named for him

<text>The Chancellor of Florence held the most important position in the bureaucracy of the Florentine Republic. Though the chancellor was not officially a member of the Republic&#x27;s elected political government, unlike the gonfaloniere or the nine members of the signoria, the role was roughly equivalent to the head of the civil service in some countries today, and its holder could still wield considerable political influence. Holders included some of the most famous scholars, political thinkers and humanists of the Renaissance.

<doc id="959136" wikidata="Q1322345" url="?curid=959136" title="Tommy F. Robinson">
<text>Tommy Franklin Robinson (March 7, 1942 – July 10, 2024) was an American businessman, lobbyist, and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1985 to 1991. He was a member of the Republican Party. Before he was elected to Congress, Robinson was the sheriff of Pulaski County.

==Early life and education==
Tommy Franklin Robinson was born in Little Rock, Arkansas and graduated from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. He served in the United States Navy from 1959 to 1963.

==Law enforcement career==
Robinson had a career in law enforcement, in which he reached the position of sheriff of Pulaski County. He previously served as a North Little Rock city patrolman, Arkansas state trooper, director of campus police at the University of Arkansas, and the police chief in Jacksonville, Arkansas. In 1979, he was appointed by Governor Bill Clinton as director of the short-lived Department of Public Safety, which was abolished in 1981 by Clinton&#x27;s successor, Republican Frank D. White. Robinson was elected sheriff of Pulaski County in 1980, having defeated the incumbent Ken Best in the Democratic primary. He was re-elected in 1982.

Robinson&#x27;s tenure was one of non-stop controversies. In early 1981, in order to relieve jail overcrowding he ordered a group of state prisoners being held at the Pulaski County Jail to be taken to the state prison at Pine Bluff. Robinson left the prisoners chained to the (front gate of the prison) when the warden refused to accept them.

The 1982 murder of Little Rock socialite Alice McArthur resulted in Robinson conducting a sensational investigation of her husband, attorney William McArthur. Robinson spent time in jail in 1983 on a federal contempt of court citation for having refused to allow the federally appointed jail master, Kenneth Basinger, to enter the jail. In response, the federal judge overseeing the case, George Howard Jr., an African-American, was described publicly by Robinson as &quot;a token judge&quot;.

When his request for more money for his office was denied, he arrested County Judge Bill Beaumont and Comptroller Jo Growcock on charges of obstructing governmental operations. He released Beaumont and Growcock only when threatened with another contempt of court citation. As a result of the constant conflict, Beaumont declined to seek another term in office in 1982.

A well-publicized raid on a &quot;toga party&quot; led by Central Arkansas Socials led to multiple lawsuits and the labeling of Robinson and his deputies as the &quot;Keyhole Kops&quot;. Governor Frank White referred to Robinson as &quot;Captain Hotdog&quot;. Robinson&#x27;s profanity-laced tirades at press conferences were common. In response to the high armed robbery rate in the county, Robinson initiated a program of placing hidden deputies in random convenience stores armed with shotguns; the result was a 96 percent drop in armed robberies during his tenure.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
Robinson was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1984 as a Democrat. He led a five-man field in the Democratic primary that included Secretary of State Paul Riviere, State Senator Stanley Russ of Conway, investment banker and former Senate aide Thedford Collins, and conservative former U.S. Representative Dale Alford. He bested Riviere in the runoff, and defeated Judy Petty, a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a former aide to the late Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, and independent Jim Taylor, a liberal Democrat horrified by the more conservative Robinson. Petty ran as a Ronald Reagan Republican but lost to Robinson even though Reagan won her district. In the three-way race, Robinson polled 103,165 votes (47%) to Petty&#x27;s 90,841 votes (41%), while the under-financed Taylor received 25,073 votes (11%). Robinson financed his race on almost $900,000 in unsecured bank loans, making his the most expensive congressional race in state history up to that time.

While in Congress, Robinson was often at odds with the Democratic leadership of Tip O&#x27;Neill and Jim Wright, and identified closely with the Boll Weevil faction. On July 28, 1989, Robinson left the Democratic Party and joined the GOP, claiming that the Democratic Party had become too liberal. He ran for governor of Arkansas in 1990 but lost in the primary election to businessman Sheffield Nelson, also a former Democrat. Nelson was in turn defeated by Bill Clinton. Robinson&#x27;s House seat was assumed in 1991 by the Democrat Ray Thornton, a former congressman and a former Arkansas Attorney General. Thornton defeated the Republican candidate, Jim Keet, then a freshman state representative and restaurateur from Little Rock. In 2010, Keet was the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial nominee against Mike Beebe.

In 1992, during the House banking scandal, Robinson, then an ex-representative, was found to have bounced 996 checks from the U.S. House bank, some of which were more than 16 months overdue. Robinson ran again for the U.S. House in 2002 after a twelve-year absence in a district in the northeastern part of the state, but lost to the Democratic incumbent, Marion Berry. In his later years, he farmed milo in Monroe County, owned a political consulting firm, and owned a liquor store. His farm, Ag_Pro Farms, was forced into bankruptcy in 2011. Governor Mike Huckabee later appointed Robinson to the Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, and he served a term as Chair of the Pardons and Parole Board.

== Death ==
Robinson died at a hospital in Forrest City, Arkansas, on July 10, 2024, at the age of 82.

<doc id="959142" wikidata="Q3344917" url="?curid=959142" title="Pedro Flores (composer)">
<text>Pedro Flores born (March 9, 1894 – July 14, 1979) was one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s best known composers of ballads and boleros.

==Early years ==
Flores (birth name: Pedro Juan Flores Córdova) was one of twelve children born into a poor family in the town of Naguabo, Puerto Rico. Flores&#x27; father died when he was only nine years old, which meant he had to do work from a young age. When Flores was sixteen years old, he took a special course at the University of Puerto Rico (Universidad de Puerto Rico) and received his teaching certificate. Flores then taught for five years, and worked for one year at a sugar mill on the island of Vieques. In 1918, he served in a clerical position in the United States Army, and was honorably discharged when he was twenty-four years old.

==Trío Borinquen==
In 1926, Flores went to New York City without having any formal musical education. There, he joined another Puerto Rican composer, Rafael Hernández, in his &quot;Trío Borinquen&quot;. Even though Flores and Hernández became very good friends, they also became competitors as composers. When Flores wrote &quot;Sin Bandera,&quot; Hernández rushed to write &quot;Preciosa&quot;.

In 1930, Flores formed his own trio called &quot;Trío Galón.” The group’s music differed from “Trío Borinquen,” with the use of faster beats. When Flores began to have problems with the music publishing company, he made the decision to leave the trio. Flores eventually returned to New York where he reconstituted his former trio. Some of the singers of this new trio were Myrta Silva, Daniel Santos and Pedro Ortiz Dávila, known as &quot;Davilita&quot;.

==Musical compositions==
Flores composed various different works, including: &quot;Obsesión&quot;, &quot;Amor Perdido&quot; (Lost Love), &quot;Bajo un Palmar&quot; (Under A Palm Tree), &quot;Borracho no Vale&quot; (which may translate to Drunk Doesn&#x27;t Count or Doesn&#x27;t Count If You&#x27;re Drunk), &quot;Linda&quot;, &quot;Sin Bandera&quot; (Without a Flag), &quot;Despedida&quot; (Farewell), and &quot;Perdón&quot; (I&#x27;m Sorry). Well known performers such as Beny More, Los Panchos, Celia Cruz, and María Luisa Landín collaborated with Flores in portraying his works. A 1996 television special honoring his work features versions by many Puerto Rican and international artists as well, such as Ednita Nazario, Marc Anthony, Yolandita Monge and Shakira.

===Selected discography===
* &quot;Despedida&quot;, single Nelson Navarro 1967

==Later years==
Pedro Flores died in San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 14, 1979, and is buried in Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery located in Old San Juan.

<text>Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Blumenthal ( ; born February 13, 1946) is an American lawyer and politician who is the senior United States senator from Connecticut, a seat he has held since 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he is one of the wealthiest members of the Senate, with a net worth over $100 million. He was Attorney General of Connecticut from 1991 to 2011.

Blumenthal graduated from Harvard University, where he was chair of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, then studied for a year at Trinity College, Cambridge, before attending Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. From 1970 to 1976, Blumenthal served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, attaining the rank of sergeant. After law school, Blumenthal passed the bar and served as administrative assistant and law clerk for several Washington, D.C. figures. From 1977 to 1981, he was United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut. In the early 1980s he worked in private law practice, including as volunteer counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Blumenthal served one term in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1985 to 1987; in 1986 he was elected to the Connecticut Senate and began service in 1987. He was elected Attorney General of Connecticut in 1990 and served for 20 years. During this period political observers speculated about him as a contender for governor of Connecticut, but he never pursued the office. Blumenthal announced his 2010 run for the U.S. Senate after incumbent Senator Chris Dodd announced his retirement. He faced Linda McMahon, a professional wrestling magnate, in the 2010 election, winning with 55% of the vote. He was sworn in on January 5, 2011. After Joe Lieberman retired in 2013, Blumenthal became Connecticut&#x27;s senior senator. He was reelected in 2016 with 63.2% of the vote, becoming the first person to receive more than a million votes in a statewide election in Connecticut, and reelected again in 2022.
==Early life and education==
Blumenthal was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jane (&quot;née&quot; Rosenstock) and Martin Blumenthal. At age 17, Martin Blumenthal immigrated to the United States from Frankfurt, Germany; Jane was raised in Omaha, Nebraska, graduated from Radcliffe College, and became a social worker. Martin Blumenthal had a career in financial services and became president of a commodities trading firm. Jane&#x27;s father, Fred &quot;Fritz&quot; Rosenstock, raised cattle, and as youths Blumenthal and his brother often visited their grandfather&#x27;s farm. Blumenthal&#x27;s brother David Blumenthal is a doctor and health care policy expert who became president of the Commonwealth Fund.

Blumenthal attended Riverdale Country School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He then attended Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1967 with an A.B. degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in government and membership in Phi Beta Kappa. As an undergraduate, he was editorial chairman of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. Blumenthal was a summer intern reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in the London Bureau. He was selected for a Fiske Fellowship, which allowed him to study at the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Trinity College in England for one year after graduation from Harvard.

In 1973, Blumenthal received his J.D. degree from Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. At Yale, he was classmates with future president Bill Clinton and future Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. One of his co-editors of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; was future United States Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. He was also a classmate of future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and radio host Michael Medved.

==Military service and controversy==

Blumenthal received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, first educational deferments, then deferments based on his occupation. In April 1970, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, which, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;virtually guaranteed that he would not be sent to Vietnam&quot;. He served in units stationed in Washington, D.C., and Connecticut from 1970 to 1976, attaining the rank of sergeant. During his 2010 Senate campaign, news report videos that showed Blumenthal claiming he had served in Vietnam created a controversy. He denied having intentionally misled voters, but acknowledged having occasionally &quot;misspoken&quot; about his service record. He later apologized to voters for remarks about his military service that he said had not been &quot;clear or precise&quot;.

==Early political career==
Blumenthal served as administrative assistant to Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, as aide to Daniel P. Moynihan when Moynihan was Assistant to President Richard Nixon, and as a law clerk to Judge Jon O. Newman, U.S. District Court of the District of Connecticut, and to Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun.

Before becoming attorney general, Blumenthal was a partner in the law firm of Cummings &amp; Lockwood, and subsequently in the law firm of Silver, Golub &amp; Sandak. In December 1982, while still at Cummings &amp; Lockwood, he created and chaired the Citizens Crime Commission of Connecticut, a private, nonprofit organization. From 1981 to 1986, he was a volunteer counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

At age 31, Blumenthal was appointed United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, serving from 1977 to 1981. As the chief federal prosecutor of that state, he successfully prosecuted many major cases involving drug traffickers, organized crime, white collar criminals, civil rights violators, consumer fraud, and environmental pollution.

In 1982, he married Cynthia Allison Malkin. She is the daughter of real estate investor Peter L. Malkin. Her maternal grandfather was lawyer and philanthropist Lawrence Wien.

In 1984, when he was 38, Blumenthal was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives, representing the 145th district. In 1987, he won a special election to fill a vacancy in the 27th district of the Connecticut Senate, at age 41. Blumenthal resided in Stamford, Connecticut.

In the 1980s, Blumenthal testified in the state legislature in favor of abolishing Connecticut&#x27;s death penalty statute. He did so after representing Joseph Green Brown, a Florida death row inmate who was found to have been wrongly convicted. Blumenthal succeeded in staving off Brown&#x27;s execution just 15 hours before it was scheduled to take place, and gained a new trial for Brown.

==Attorney General of Connecticut==
Blumenthal was elected the 23rd attorney general of Connecticut in 1990 and reelected in 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006. On October 10, 2002, he was awarded the Raymond E. Baldwin Award for Public Service by the Quinnipiac University School of Law.

=== Tenure ===

====Pequot land annexation bid====
In May 1995, Blumenthal and the state of Connecticut filed lawsuits challenging a decision by the Department of the Interior to approve a bid by the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot for annexation of 165 acres of land in the towns of Ledyard, North Stonington and Preston. The Pequot were attempting to have the land placed in a federal trust, a legal designation to provide them with land for their sovereign control, as long years of colonization had left them landless. Blumenthal argued that the Interior Department&#x27;s decision in support of this action was &quot;fatally, legally flawed, and unfair&quot; and that &quot;it would unfairly remove land from the tax rolls of the surrounding towns and bar local control over how the land is used, while imposing [a] tremendous burden.&quot; The tribe announced the withdrawal of the land annexation petition in February 2002.

====Interstate air pollution====
In 1997, Blumenthal and Governor John G. Rowland petitioned the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address interstate air pollution problems created from Midwest and southeastern sources. The petition was filed in accordance with Section 126 of the Clean Air Act, which allows a state to request pollution reductions from out-of-state sources that contribute significantly to its air quality problems.

In 2003, Blumenthal and the attorneys general of eight other states (New York, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont) filed a federal lawsuit against the Bush administration for &quot;endangering air quality by gutting a critical component of the federal Clean Air Act.&quot; The suit alleged that changes in the act would have exempted thousands of industrial air pollution sources from the act&#x27;s New Source Review provision and that the new rules and regulations would lead to an increase in air pollution.

====Tobacco====
While attorney general, Blumenthal was one of the leaders of a 46-state lawsuit against the tobacco industry, which alleged that the companies involved had deceived the public about the dangers of smoking. He argued that the state of Connecticut should be reimbursed for Medicaid expenses related to smoking. In 1998, the tobacco companies reached a $246 billion national settlement, giving the 46 states involved 25 years of reimbursement payments. Connecticut&#x27;s share of the settlement was estimated at $3.6 billion.

In December 2007, Blumenthal filed suit against RJ Reynolds, alleging that a 2007 Camel advertising spread in &quot;Rolling Stone magazine&quot; used cartoons in violation of the master tobacco settlement, which prohibited the use of cartoons in cigarette advertising because they entice children and teenagers to smoke. The company paid the state of Connecticut $150,000 to settle the suit and agreed to end the advertising campaign.

====Microsoft lawsuit====
In May 1998, Blumenthal and the attorneys general of 19 other states and the District of Columbia filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing it of abusing its monopoly power to stifle competition. The suit, which centered on Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 98 operating system and its contractual restrictions imposed on personal computer manufacturers to tie the operating system to its Internet Explorer browser, was eventually merged with a federal case brought by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Janet Reno.

A 2000 landmark federal court decision ruled that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws, and the court ordered that the company be broken up. In 2001, the federal appeals court agreed, but rather than break up the company, it sent the case to a new judge to hold hearings and determine appropriate remedies. Remedies were later proposed by Blumenthal and eight other attorneys general; these included requiring that Microsoft license an unbundled version of Windows in which middleware and operating system code were not commingled.

In 2001, the Bush administration&#x27;s DOJ settled with Microsoft in an agreement criticized by many states and other industry experts as insufficient. In November 2002, a federal court ruling imposed those same remedies. In August 2007, Blumenthal and five other states and the District of Columbia filed a report alleging that the federal settlement with Microsoft and court-imposed Microsoft remedies had failed to adequately reduce Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly.

====Stanley Works====
On May 10, 2002, Blumenthal and Connecticut State Treasurer Denise L. Nappier helped to stop the hostile takeover of New Britain-based Stanley Works, a major Connecticut employer, by filing a lawsuit alleging that the move to reincorporate in Bermuda based on a shareholder&#x27;s vote of May 9 was &quot;rife with voting irregularities.&quot; The agreement to temporarily halt the move was signed by New Britain Superior Court Judge Marshall Berger. On June 3 Blumenthal referred the matter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for further investigation and on June 25 he testified before the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means that &quot;Longtime American corporations with operations in other countries can dodge tens of millions of dollars in federal taxes by the device of reincorporating in another country&quot; by &quot;simply [filing] incorporation papers in a country with friendly tax laws, open a post-office box and hold an annual meeting there&quot; and that Stanley Works, along with &quot;Cooper Industries, Seagate Technologies, Ingersoll-Rand and PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, to name but a few, have also become pseudo-foreign corporations for the sole purpose of saving tax dollars.&quot; Blumenthal said, &quot;Corporations proposing to reincorporate to Bermuda, such as Stanley, often tell shareholders that there is no material difference in the law&quot;, but said that this was not the case and was misleading to their shareholders. In order to rectify this situation he championed the Corporate Patriot Enforcement Act to close tax loopholes.

====Tomasso Group and Rowland corruption====
Blumenthal was involved in a series of lawsuits against associates of Connecticut governor Rowland and the various entities of the Tomasso Group over Tomasso&#x27;s bribing of state officials, including Rowland, in exchange for the awarding of lucrative state contracts. Blumenthal subpoenaed Tomasso Brothers Inc.; Tomasso Brothers Construction Co.; TBI Construction Co. LLC; Tunxis Plantation Country Club; Tunxis Management Co.; Tunxis Management Co. II; and Tenergy Water LLC (all part of the Tomasso Group). Lawyers for the Tomasso Group argued that the attorney general had no special power to look into the operations of private firms under whistleblower law as no actual whistleblowers had come forward and all incriminating testimony was in related federal cases. Connecticut law requires the attorney general to both be the attorney for the state and investigate the state government&#x27;s misdeeds, and the rules governing the office did not adequately address this inherent conflict of interest. The state&#x27;s case against the Tomasso Group failed but federal investigations ended in prison sentences for the Group&#x27;s president, for Rowland, and for a number of his associates. The Tomasso Group stopped bidding on state contracts to avoid a substantial legal challenge from Blumenthal under newly written compliance statutes.

====Charter schools lawsuit====
In September 1999, Blumenthal announced a lawsuit against Robin Barnes, the president and treasurer of New Haven-based charter school the Village Academy, for serious financial mismanagement of the state-subsidized charitable organization. Citing common law, the suit sought to recover money misspent and serious damages resulting from Barnes&#x27;s alleged breach of duty.

In a Connecticut Supreme Court decision, &quot;Blumenthal v. Barnes&quot; (2002), a unanimous court determined that the state attorney general could act using only the powers specifically authorized by the state legislature, and that since the attorney general&#x27;s jurisdiction is defined by statute rather than common law, Blumenthal lacked the authority to cite common law as the basis for filing suit against Barnes. Despite this ruling, Blumenthal announced that he intended to pursue a separate 2000 lawsuit against the school&#x27;s trustees filed on behalf of the State Department of Education.

====Regional transmission organization====
In 2003 Blumenthal, former Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly, Rhode Island Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch, and consumer advocates from Connecticut, Maine, and New Hampshire opposed &quot;the formation of a regional transmission organization (RTO) that would merge three Northeast and mid-Atlantic power operators, called Independent Service Operators (ISOs), into a single super-regional RTO.&quot; In a press release, he said, &quot;This fatally flawed RTO proposal will raise rates, reduce accountability and reward market manipulation. It will increase the power and profits of transmission operators with an immediate $40 million price tag for consumers.&quot; The opposition was due to a report authored by Synapse Energy Economics, Inc. , a Cambridge-based energy consulting firm, that alleged that consumers would be worse off under the merger.

====Gina Kolb lawsuit====
In 2004, Blumenthal sued Computer Plus Center of East Hartford and its owner, Gina Kolb, on behalf of the state. It was alleged that CPC overcharged $50 per computer, $500,000 in total, on a three-year, $17.2 million contract to supply computers to the state. Blumenthal sued for $1.75 million. Kolb was arrested in 2004 and charged with first-degree larceny. Kolb later countersued, claiming the state had grossly abused its power. Kolb was initially awarded $18.3 million in damages, but Blumenthal appealed the decision and the damages initially awarded were reduced to $1.83 million. Superior Court judge Barry Stevens described the jury&#x27;s initial award of $18.3 million as a &quot;shocking injustice&quot; and said it was &quot;influenced by partiality or mistake.&quot;

====Big East and ACC====
Blumenthal played a pivotal role in the expansion of the Atlantic Coast Conference and the departures of Boston College, Miami, and Virginia Tech from the Big East. He led efforts by the Big East football schools (Virginia Tech, Rutgers, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia) in legal proceedings against the Atlantic Coast Conference, the University of Miami and Boston College, accusing them of improper disclosure of confidential information and of conspiring to dismantle the Big East. According to Blumenthal, the case was pursued because &quot;the future of the Big East Conference was at risk—the stakes huge for both state taxpayers and the university&#x27;s good name.&quot; The suits cost the schools involved $2.2 million in the first four months of litigation. The lawsuit against the ACC was initially dismissed on jurisdictional grounds but was subsequently refiled. A declaratory judgment by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts exonerated Boston College in the matter. Virginia Tech accepted an invitation from the ACC and withdrew from the suit to remove itself from the awkward position of suing its new conference. An out-of-court $5 million settlement was eventually reached, which included a $1 million exit fee that Boston College was required to pay the Big East under the league&#x27;s constitution.

Some have speculated that the lawsuit was one of the biggest reasons that the University of Connecticut was not sought after by the ACC during its 2011 additions of then-Big East members Syracuse and Pittsburgh. From 2013 to 2020 UConn was a member of the less lucrative American Athletic Conference, the successor to the original Big East, before rejoining the Big East in 2020.

====Interstate 84====
On October 2, 2006, Blumenthal launched an investigation of a botched reconstruction project of Interstate 84 in Waterbury and Cheshire. The original contractor for the job, L.G. DeFelice, went out of business and it was later revealed that hundreds of storm drains had been improperly installed. Blumenthal subsequently announced lawsuits against L.G. DeFelice and the Maguire Group, the engineering firm that inspected the project. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty, the insurer behind the performance bond for the I-84 construction, agreed to pay $17.5 million to settle the claims. Under the agreement, the state of Connecticut retained the right to sue L.G. DeFelice for additional funds. In 2009, the bonding company agreed to pay an additional $4.6 million settlement, bringing the total award to $22.1 million ($30,000 more than the repair costs).

====Lyme disease guidelines investigation====
In November 2006, Blumenthal tried, as Paul A. Offit described it, &quot;to legislate a disease, Chronic Lyme, into existence&quot;. He launched an antitrust investigation into the Infectious Diseases Society of America&#x27;s (IDSA&#x27;s) 2006 guidelines regarding the treatment of Lyme disease. Responding to concerns from chronic Lyme disease advocacy groups, Blumenthal claimed the IDSA guidelines would &quot;severely constrict choices and legitimate diagnosis and treatment options for patients.&quot; The medical validity of the IDSA guidelines was not challenged, and a journalist writing in &quot;Nature Medicine&quot; suggested some IDSA members may not have disclosed potential conflicts of interest, while a &quot;Forbes&quot; piece described Blumenthal&#x27;s investigation as &quot;intimidation&quot; of scientists by an elected official with close ties to Lyme advocacy groups. The &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; described the decision as an example of the &quot;politicization of health policy&quot; that went against the weight of scientific evidence and may have a chilling effect on future decisions by medical associations. In 2008, Blumenthal ended the investigation after the IDSA agreed to conduct a review of the guidelines. In 2010, an eight-member independent review panel unanimously agreed that the original 2006 guideline recommendations were &quot;medically and scientifically justified&quot; in the light of the evidence. The committee did not change any of the earlier recommendations but did alter some of the language in an executive summary of the findings. Blumenthal said he would review the final report.

====MySpace/Facebook====
In March 2006, Blumenthal noted that more than seven incidents of sexual assault in Connecticut had been linked directly to MySpace contacts. Earlier that year, Blumenthal and attorneys general in at least five other states were involved in discussions with MySpace that resulted in the implementation of technological changes aimed at protecting children from pornography and child predators on the company&#x27;s website. At Blumenthal&#x27;s urging, MySpace installed a link to free blocking software (&quot;K9 Web Protection&quot;), but in May 2006, Blumenthal announced that the site had failed to make the program easy to find and that it was not clearly labeled. He also urged MySpace to take further steps to safeguard children, including purging deep links to pornography and inappropriate material, tougher age verification, and banning users under 16.

Blumenthal was co-chair, along with North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, of the State Attorney General Task Force on Social Networking. In 2008, the attorneys general commissioned the Internet Safety Technical Task Force report, which researched &quot;ways to help squash the onslaught of sexual predators targeting younger social-networking clients&quot;.

Blumenthal&#x27;s office subpoenaed MySpace for information about the number of registered sex offenders on its site. In 2009, MySpace revealed that over a two-year span it had roughly 90,000 members who were registered sex offenders (nearly double what MySpace officials had originally estimated one year earlier). Blumenthal accused MySpace of having &quot;monstrously inadequate counter-measures&quot; to prevent sex offenders from creating MySpace profiles.

Blumenthal and Cooper secured agreements from MySpace and Facebook to make their sites safer. Both implemented dozens of safeguards, including finding better ways to verify users&#x27; ages, banning convicted sex offenders, and limiting the ability of older users to search for members under 18.

In 2024, Blumenthal helped lead the Kids Online Safety Act to address depression, sexual exploitation, bullying, harassment, and other harms children experience online.

====Craigslist====
In March 2008, Blumenthal issued a letter to Craigslist attorneys demanding that the website cease allowing postings for erotic services, which he claimed promoted prostitution, and accused the site of &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; to the problem. He worked with Craigslist and a group of 40 attorneys general to create new measures on the site designed to thwart ads for prostitution and other illegal sexual activities. In April 2009, Craigslist came under the scrutiny of law enforcement agencies following the arrest of Philip Markoff (the &quot;Craigslist Killer&quot;), suspected of killing a 25-year-old masseuse he met through Craigslist at a Boston hotel. Blumenthal subsequently called for a series of specific measures to fight prostitution and pornography on Craigslist—including steep financial penalties for rule breaking, and incentives for reporting wrongdoing. He said, &quot;Craigslist has the means—and moral obligation—to stop the pimping and prostituting in plain sight.&quot;

Leading a coalition of 39 states, in May 2010 Blumenthal subpoenaed Craigslist as part of an investigation into whether the site was taking sufficient action to curb prostitution ads and whether it was profiting from them. He said that prostitution ads remained on the site despite previous assurances that they would be removed. The subpoena sought documents related to Craigslist&#x27;s processes for reviewing potentially objectionable ads, as well as documents detailing the revenue gained from ads sold to Craigslist&#x27;s erotic services and adult services categories. In August 2010, Blumenthal called on Craigslist to shut the section down permanently and take steps to eradicate prostitution ads from other parts of the site. He also called on Congress to alter a landmark communications law (the Communications Decency Act) that Craigslist has cited in defense of the ads.

Following continued pressure, Craigslist removed the adult services sections from its U.S. sites in September 2010 and from its international sites in December 2010. Blumenthal called the decision a victory against sexual exploitation of women and children, and against human trafficking connected to prostitution.

Blumenthal and other state attorneys general reached a settlement with Craigslist on the issue; the settlement called for the company to charge people via credit card for any ads that were suggestive in nature so the person could be tracked down if they were determined to be offering prostitution. But Blumenthal remarked that after the settlement, the ads continued to flourish using code words.

====Terrorist surveillance program====
In October 2007, Blumenthal and the attorneys general of four other states lobbied Congress to reject proposals to provide immunity from litigation to telecommunications firms that cooperated with the federal government&#x27;s terrorist surveillance program following the September 11 attacks. In 2008 Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law a new terrorist surveillance bill including the telecom immunity provisions Blumenthal opposed.

====Countrywide Financial====
In August 2008, Blumenthal announced that Connecticut had joined California, Illinois and Florida in suing subprime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial (now owned by Bank of America) for fraudulent business practices. The suit alleged that Countrywide pushed consumers into &quot;deceptive, unaffordable loans and workouts, and charged homeowners in default unjustified and excessive legal fees.&quot; According to Blumenthal, &quot;Countrywide conned customers into loans that were clearly unaffordable and unsustainable, turning the American Dream of homeownership into a nightmare&quot; and when consumers defaulted, &quot;the company bullied them into workouts doomed to fail.&quot; He also claimed that Countrywide &quot;crammed unconscionable legal fees into renegotiated loans, digging consumers deeper into debt&quot; and &quot;broke promises that homeowners could refinance, condemning them to hopelessly unaffordable loans.&quot; The lawsuit demanded that Countrywide make restitution to affected borrowers, give up improper gains and rescind, reform or modify all mortgages that broke state laws. It is also sought civil fines of up to $100,000 per violation of state banking laws, and up to $5,000 per violation of state consumer protection laws.

In October 2008, Bank of America initially agreed to settle the states&#x27; suits for $8.4 billion, and in February 2010, Countrywide mailed payments of $3,452.54 to 370 Connecticut residents. The settlement forced Bank of America to establish a $150 million fund to help repay borrowers whose homes had been foreclosed upon, $1.3 million of which went to Connecticut.

Blumenthal commented in defense of U.S. senator and Senate Banking Committee chair Christopher Dodd, who had been harshly criticized for accepting a VIP loan from Countrywide, &quot;there&#x27;s no evidence of wrongdoing on [Mr. Dodd&#x27;s] part any more than victims who were misled or deceived by Countrywide.&quot; In August 2010, Dodd was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee, which found &quot;no credible evidence&quot; that he knowingly tried to use his status as a U.S. senator to receive loan terms not available to the public.

====Global warming====
Blumenthal has been a vocal advocate of the scientific consensus on climate change, that human activity is responsible for rising global temperatures and that prompt action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be taken. He has urged the Environmental Protection Agency to declare carbon dioxide a dangerous air pollutant. &quot;I urge the new Obama EPA to declare carbon dioxide a danger to human health and welfare so we can at last begin addressing the potentially disastrous threat global warming poses to health, the environment and our economy. We must make up for lost time before it&#x27;s too late to curb dangerous warming threatening to devastate the planet and human society.&quot; He has brought suit against a number of electric utilities in the Midwest, arguing that coal-burning power plants are generating excess emissions. In 2009, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to allow Blumenthal&#x27;s lawsuit to proceed. Blumenthal has said, &quot;no reputable climate scientist disputes the reality of global warming. It is fact, plain and simple. Dithering will be disastrous.&quot;

==Prospect of gubernatorial candidacy==
Blumenthal was often considered a top prospect for the Democratic nominee for governor of Connecticut, but never ran for the office.

On March 18, 2007, &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; columnist Kevin Rennie reported that Blumenthal had become seriously interested in running for governor in 2010. On February 2, 2009, Blumenthal announced he would forgo a gubernatorial run and seek reelection that year as attorney general.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

==== 2010 ====
After Chris Dodd announced on January 6, 2010, that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his term, Blumenthal told the Associated Press that he would run in the election for Dodd&#x27;s seat in November 2010. Later that day, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden called Blumenthal to express their best wishes.

The same day, Public Policy Polling released a poll they took on the two preceding evenings, including races where Blumenthal was paired against each of the three most-mentioned Republicans contending for their party&#x27;s nomination for the seat. He led by at least 30% in each hypothetical race: against Rob Simmons (59%–28%), against Linda McMahon (60%–28%), and against Peter Schiff (63%–23%), with a 4.3% margin of error cited. Rasmussen Reports also polled after Blumenthal announced his candidacy and found a somewhat more competitive race, but with Blumenthal holding a strong lead.

A February poll by Rasmussen found that Blumenthal held leads of 19 against Simmons and 20 against McMahon, and that Republicans had made up little ground since the initial Rasmussen poll after Blumenthal announced. On May 21, Blumenthal received the Democratic nomination by acclamation.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Blumenthal misspoke on at least one occasion by saying he&#x27;d served with the military &quot;in Vietnam&quot;. Video emerged of him speaking to a group of veterans and supporters in March 2008 in Norwalk, saying, in reference to supporting troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, &quot;We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.&quot; There were also other occasions where he accurately described his military service. At a 2008 ceremony in Shelton, Connecticut, he said, &quot;I served during the Vietnam era... I remember the taunts, the insults, sometimes even physical abuse.&quot;

Blumenthal&#x27;s commanding officer in 1974 and 1975, Larry Baldino of Woodbridge, addressed the controversy in a letter to the editor in the &quot;New Haven Register&quot;. Baldino wrote that the misleading statement was too &quot;petty&quot; to be the basis for supporting or not supporting Blumenthal. Baldino further called Blumenthal &quot;good-natured&quot; and &quot;one of the best Marines with whom I ever worked&quot;.

Days after the nomination, Quinnipiac University Polling Institute polling indicated that Blumenthal held a 25-point lead over McMahon. The Cook Political Report changed its assessment of the race to &quot;Leans Democratic&quot;, making Blumenthal the favored candidate over McMahon.

Blumenthal won the November 2 election, defeating McMahon 55% to 43%.

====2016====

August Wolf, a bond salesman and former Olympian, was the only declared Republican candidate running against Blumenthal in the 2016 Senate election.

In August 2015, economist Larry Kudlow threatened to run against Blumenthal if Blumenthal voted in favor of the Iran Nuclear Deal.

According to a pair of Quinnipiac polls on October 15, 2015, Blumenthal had a 34-point lead over Kudlow and a 35-point lead over Wolf.

Blumenthal was reelected with 63% of the vote against Republican state representative Dan Carter, becoming the first person in Connecticut&#x27;s history to receive over a million votes in a single election.

====2022====

In November 2020, Blumenthal announced that he would seek reelection in 2022. In the general election, he defeated Leora Levy, who defeated former Connecticut House Minority Leader Themis Klarides in the Republican primary.

===Tenure===
Blumenthal was sworn into the 112th United States Congress on January 5, 2011. He announced plans to return to Connecticut every weekend to join a &quot;listening tour&quot; of his home state.
In March 2012, Blumenthal and New York senator Chuck Schumer gained national attention after they called upon Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to investigate practices by employers to require Facebook passwords for employee applicants and workers.

Blumenthal worked with Senator Mark Kirk to eliminate pensions for members of Congress who are convicted of felonies while serving in office.

In &quot;Blumenthal v. Trump&quot;, Blumenthal and Representative John Conyers Jr. led a group of 196 congressmen in filing a federal lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the emoluments clause of the US Constitution.

In the wake of the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, Blumenthal blamed Trump, saying that Trump &quot;incited, instigated and supported&quot; the attack. He called for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Blumenthal also requested an investigation into the lack of response from law enforcement and the military.

In December 2021, Blumenthal gave a speech honoring three local labor activists at an awards ceremony in New Haven that was hosted by the Connecticut People&#x27;s World Committee, an affiliate of the Connecticut Communist Party. After criticism from national Republican politicians and conservative media outlets, Blumenthal said that he is &quot;a strong supporter and believer in American capitalism&quot; and would not have attended had he known of the group&#x27;s Communist ties.

==Political positions==
The American Conservative Union gave him a 3% lifetime conservative rating in 2019.

=== Abortion ===
Blumenthal is pro-choice. He supports efforts to make it a crime for demonstrators to block access to health clinics. He opposed efforts by Walmart to ban the sale of emergency contraception and supports requirements that pharmacies fill birth control prescriptions. He supports federal funding for family planning clinics. After &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was overturned in June 2022, Blumenthal said the decision &quot;strips women of the freedom to make their own health care decisions &amp; puts that power in the hands of the government.&quot;

===Animal welfare===
In 2024, Blumenthal and U.S. representatives Earl Blumenauer and Brian Fitzpatrick introduced the Captive Primate Safety Act, which would prohibit private ownership of chimpanzees and other primates as pets. The legislation was endorsed by animal rights and animal welfare groups and law enforcement associations.

=== Foreign relations ===

==== China ====
In April 2018, Blumenthal stated his support for &quot;strong efforts to crack down on intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices by China or any other nation&quot;, but said that Trump was implementing &quot;trade policy by tweet, reaction based on impulse and rash rhetoric that can only escalate tensions with all economic powers and lead to a trade war&quot; and that U.S. actions through trade without a strategy or an endgame seemed &quot;highly dangerous&quot; to the American economy.

In June 2018, Blumenthal cosponsored a bipartisan bill that would reinstate penalties on ZTE for export control violations in addition to barring American government agencies from either purchasing or leasing equipment or services from ZTE or Huawei. The bill was offered as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for 2019 and was in direct contrast to the Trump administration&#x27;s announced intent to ease sanctions on ZTE.

In August 2018, Blumenthal and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang region. They wrote, &quot;The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in &#x27;political reeducation&#x27; centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.&quot;

In May 2019, Blumenthal was a cosponsor of the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act, a bipartisan bill reintroduced by Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin that was intended to disrupt China&#x27;s consolidation or expansion of its claims of jurisdiction over both the sea and air space in disputed zones in the South China Sea.

In July 2019, Blumenthal was a cosponsor of the Defending America&#x27;s 5G Future Act, a bill that would prevent Huawei from being removed from the &quot;entity list&quot; of the Commerce Department without an act of Congress and authorize Congress to block administration waivers for U.S. companies to do business with Huawei. The bill would also codify Trump&#x27;s executive order from the previous May that empowered his administration to block foreign tech companies deemed a national security threat from conducting business in the United States.

==== Middle East ====

In March 2017, Blumenthal co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In March 2019, Blumenthal was one of nine Democratic senators to sign a letter to Salman of Saudi Arabia requesting the release of human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair and writer Raif Badawi, women&#x27;s rights activists Loujain al-Hathloul and Samar Badawi, and Dr. Walid Fitaih. The senators wrote, &quot;Not only have reputable international organizations detailed the arbitrary detention of peaceful activists and dissidents without trial for long periods, but the systematic discrimination against women, religious minorities and mistreatment of migrant workers and others has also been well-documented.&quot;

In October 2022, Saudi Arabia, with Russia, announced a cut of 2 million barrels a day of oil production at the OPEC+ meeting. Blumenthal accused Saudi Arabia of undermining U.S. efforts and helping to boost 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In an opinion piece, he and Ro Khanna proposed to promptly pause the massive transfer of American warfare technology to Saudi Arabia and take a tougher stance against the kingdom.

=== Government shutdown ===
In March 2019, Blumenthal and 38 other senators signed a letter to the Appropriations Committee opining that contractor workers and by extension their families &quot;should not be penalized for a government shutdown that they did nothing to cause&quot; while noting that there were bills in both chambers of Congress that would provide back pay to compensate contractor employees for lost wages, urging the Appropriations Committee &quot;to include back pay for contractor employees in a supplemental appropriations bill for FY2019 or as part of the regular appropriations process for FY2020.&quot;

===Gun control===

Blumenthal supports gun control. He supports a national assault weapons ban and introduced such a ban in 2017 and 2023. As of 2010, Blumenthal had a &quot;F&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund for his pro-gun-control voting record.

In response to the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Blumenthal gave his support for improved access to mental health resources and universal background checks.

In January 2016, Blumenthal was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Thad Cochran and Barbara Mikulski requesting that the Labor, Health and Education subcommittee hold a hearing on whether to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund a study of gun violence and &quot;the annual appropriations rider that some have interpreted as preventing it&quot; with taxpayer dollars. The senators noted their support for taking steps &quot;to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public-health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.&quot;

In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, Blumenthal said, &quot;The Senate&#x27;s inaction on commonsense gun violence prevention makes it complicit in this public health crisis. Prayers and platitudes are insufficient. The American public is beseeching us to act on commonsense, sensible gun violence prevention measures, and we must heed that call.&quot;

In October 2016, Blumenthal participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster, speaking in support of the Feinstein Amendment, which would have banned people known to be or suspected of being terrorists from buying guns. That same year, he stated his support for efforts to require toy or fake firearms to have orange parts so they could more easily be distinguished from real guns.

In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Blumenthal declared in an interview with Judy Woodruff, &quot;we must break the grip of the NRA&quot;. He continued, &quot;we can at least save lives. Would it have prevented the Las Vegas atrocity, that unspeakable tragedy? We will never know. But it might have, and we can definitely prevent such mass shootings by adopting these kinds of commonsense measures.&quot;

In 2018, Blumenthal was a cosponsor of the NICS Denial Notification Act, legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.

In January 2019, Blumenthal was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill&#x27;s background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one&#x27;s immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.

In June 2019, Blumenthal was one of four senators to cosponsor the Help Empower Americans to Respond (HEAR) Act, legislation that would ban suppressors being imported, sold, made, sent elsewhere or possessed and grant a silencer buyback program as well as include certain exceptions for current and former law enforcement personnel and others. The bill was intended to respond to the Virginia Beach shooting, where the perpetrator used a .45-caliber handgun with multiple extended magazines and a suppressor.

=== Health care ===
In February 2019, Blumenthal and 22 other Democratic senators introduced the State Public Option Act, a bill that would authorize states to form a Medicaid buy-in program for all residents and thereby grant all denizens of the state the ability to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan if they wished. Brian Schatz, a bill cosponsor, said the legislation would &quot;unlock each state&#x27;s Medicaid program to anyone who wants it, giving people a high-quality, low-cost public health insurance option&quot;, and that its goal was &quot;to make sure that every single American has comprehensive health care coverage.&quot;

In June 2019, Blumenthal was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Territories Health Equity Act of 2019, legislation that would remove the cap on annual federal Medicaid funding and increase federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures of territories along with more funds being provided for prescription drug coverage to low-income seniors in an attempt to equalize funding for American territories Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands with that of U.S. states.

In June 2019, Blumenthal and 14 other senators introduced the Affordable Medications Act, legislation intended to promote transparency by mandating that pharmaceutical companies disclose the amount of money going to research and development, marketing and executives&#x27; salaries. The bill also abolished the restriction that stopped the federal Medicare program from using its buying power to negotiate lower drug prices for beneficiaries and hinder drug company monopoly practices used to keep prices high and disable less expensive generics entering the market.

In August 2019, Blumenthal was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences in the event that the &quot;Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act&quot; (ACA) lawsuit prevailed in courts, claiming that an overhaul of the present health care system would form &quot;an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets&quot;. That same month, Blumenthal, three other Senate Democrats, and Bernie Sanders signed a letter to acting FDA commissioner Ned Sharpless in response to Novartis falsifying data as part of an attempt to gain the FDA&#x27;s approval for its new gene therapy Zolgensma, writing that it was &quot;unconscionable that a drug company would provide manipulated data to federal regulators in order to rush its product to market, reap federal perks, and charge the highest amount in American history for its medication.&quot;

=== Immigration ===
In August 2018, Blumenthal was one of 17 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Kamala Harris to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying &quot;trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.&quot;

In April 2019, Blumenthal was one of six Democratic senators to sign a letter to acting defense secretary Patrick M. Shanahan expressing concern over memos by Marine Corps general Robert Neller in which Neller critiqued deployments to the southern border and funding transfers under Trump&#x27;s national emergency declaration as having posed an &quot;unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency&quot; and noted that other military officials had recently stated that troop deployment did not affect readiness. The senators requested Shanahan explain the inconsistencies and that he provide both &quot;a staff-level briefing on this matter within seven days&quot; and an explanation of how he would address Neller&#x27;s concerns.

In June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department&#x27;s confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Blumenthal and 11 other senators introduced The Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to an applicant&#x27;s immigration status.

In June 2019, Blumenthal and six other Democratic senators led by Brian Schatz sent letters to the Government Accountability Office along with the suspension and debarment official and inspector general at the US Department of Health and Human Services citing recent reports that showed &quot;significant evidence that some federal contractors and grantees have not provided adequate accommodations for children in line with legal and contractual requirements&quot; and urging government officials to determine whether federal contractors and grantees were in violation of contractual obligations or federal regulations and should thus face financial consequences.

In July 2019, following reports that the Trump administration intended to end protections of spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Blumenthal was one of 22 senators to sign a letter led by Tammy Duckworth arguing that the program allowed service members the ability &quot;to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away&quot; and that the program&#x27;s termination would cause personal hardship for service members in combat.

In July 2019, Blumenthal and 15 other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor before engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations except in special circumstances and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to annually report enforcement actions in those locations.

=== LGBT rights ===
In September 2014, Blumenthal was one of 69 members of the US House and Senate to sign a letter to then-FDA commissioner Sylvia Burwell requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding 5 years.

In June 2019, Blumenthal was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to United States secretary of state Mike Pompeo requesting an explanation of a State Department decision not to issue an official statement that year commemorating Pride Month or the annual cable outlining activities for embassies commemorating Pride Month. They also asked why the LGBTI special envoy position had remained vacant and asserted that &quot;preventing the official flying of rainbow flags and limiting public messages celebrating Pride Month signals to the international community that the United States is abandoning the advancement of LGBTI rights as a foreign policy priority.&quot;

In 2022, Blumenthal voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation intended to codify same-sex marriage rights into federal law.

=== Special Counsel investigation ===
In March 2019, after Attorney General William Barr released a summary of the Mueller report, Blumenthal said the issue was about &quot;obstruction of justice, no exoneration there, and the judgment by William Barr may have been completely improper&quot; and that he did not &quot;deeply respect and trust the Barr summary, which was designed to frame the message before the information was available.&quot; After the Justice Department publicly released the redacted version of the report the following month, Blumenthal said, &quot;What&#x27;s demonstrated in powerful and compelling detail in this report is nothing less than a national scandal. This report is far from the end of the inquiry that this country needs and deserves. It is the beginning of another chapter.&quot;

In April 2019, Blumenthal was one of 12 Democratic senators to sign a letter led by Mazie Hirono that questioned Barr&#x27;s decision to offer &quot;his own conclusion that the President&#x27;s conduct did not amount to obstruction of justice&quot; and called for both the Justice Department&#x27;s inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility to launch an investigation into whether Barr&#x27;s summary of the Mueller report and his April 18 news conference were misleading.

===2024 New Jersey drone sightings===
In 2024, Blumenthal said suspicious drones found flying over areas in the New Jersey and North Atlantic region should be shot down if necessary and that &quot;We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they&#x27;re flying over airports or military bases&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On June 27, 1982, Blumenthal married Cynthia Malkin. They were engaged during her senior year at Harvard and married the following year. She is the daughter of Peter L. Malkin and maternal granddaughter of Lawrence Wien. They have four children. Their son Matt Blumenthal was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives from the 147th district in 2018.
Blumenthal&#x27;s wealth exceeds $100 million, making him one of the Senate&#x27;s richest members. His family&#x27;s net worth derives largely from his wife; the Malkins are influential real estate developers and property managers with holdings including an ownership stake in the Empire State Building. His brother-in-law Scott Malkin is a co-owner of the New York Islanders.

On April 8, 2023, while at a parade celebrating the UConn Huskies men&#x27;s basketball team winning the 2023 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament championship, another attendee inadvertently fell on Blumenthal, causing a minor fracture of his femur. He underwent surgery, which he said was successful, and left the hospital on April 10.

<text>[[Sayyid]] Majid bin Saïd al-Busaidi () ( – ) was the first Sultan of Zanzibar. He ruled Zanzibar from 19 October 1856 to 7 October 1870. 

He succeeded his father Said bin Sultan as ruler of Zanzibar and East Africa, and briefly (claimed) Oman following Said’s death. During his reign his brother Bargash would prove constantly rebellious and adhered to his rule, nonetheless, Majid remained in power until his untimely death which was due to ‘&quot;over indulgence in sensual pleasures and stimulants&quot;’. The region’s wealth soared, particularly with the controversial Zanzibar slave trade.

==Life==
Sayyid Majid bin Said was born in 1834 in Zanzibar to Said bin Sultan and Sarah, a Circassian . Majid was the second eldest of Said’s children born in Zanzibar, after Khalid bin Said (died 1854). 

Majid became Sultan of the Omani Empire, based at the capital at Zanzibar, following the death of his father, Sayyid Said bin Sultan, but his accession was contested. Following the struggle over the accession to the position of Sultan of Oman, Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate sultanates, with Majid ruling Zanzibar and his older brother Thuwaini ruling Oman.

His marriage produced only one daughter, Sayyida Khanfora bint Majid (who married her cousin, Hamoud bin Mohammed). Consequently, Majid was succeeded as Sultan by his brother Barghash. Majid&#x27;s grandson Ali bin Hamud Al-Busaid later became the 8th Sultan of Zanzibar, while his great-grandson Abdullah bin Khalifa Al-Said was the 10th Sultan.

In 1866, he purchased the former Confederate commerce raider CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and renamed her &quot;El Majidi&quot; after himself.

In 1871, botanists published a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Sapindaceae, from Central Africa and called it &quot;Majidea&quot; in his honour.

<text>Sayyid Hamad bin Thuwaini Al-Busaidi () ( – ) was the fifth Sultan of Zanzibar. He ruled Zanzibar from 5 March 1893 to 25 August 1896.

==Life==
Hamad bin Thuwaini Al-Busaid was born in 1857, probably in Zanzibar, as a son of Sultan Thuwaini bin Said.

He was married to his cousin, Sayyida Turkia bint Turki Al-Said, daughter of Turki bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Hamad died suddenly at 11:40 AM on 25 August 1896 and was almost certainly poisoned by his cousin Khalid bin Barghash who proclaimed himself the new Sultan and held the position for three days before being replaced by the British Armed Forces after the Anglo-Zanzibar War.
