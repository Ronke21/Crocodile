<doc id="971780" wikidata="Q19294" url="?curid=971780" title="List of United States presidential candidates">
<text>This article is a list of United States presidential candidates. The first U.S. presidential election was held in 1788–1789, followed by the second in 1792. Presidential elections have been held every four years thereafter.

Presidential candidates win the election by winning a majority of the electoral vote. If no candidate wins a majority of the electoral vote, the winner is determined through a contingent election held in the United States House of Representatives; this situation has occurred twice in U.S. history. The procedures governing presidential elections were changed significantly with the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804. Since 1824, a national popular vote has been tallied for each election, but the national popular vote does not directly affect the winner of the presidential election.

The United States has had a two-party system for much of its history, and the major parties of the two-party system have dominated presidential elections for most of U.S. history. The two current major parties are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. At various points prior to the American Civil War, the Federalist Party, the Democratic-Republican Party, the National Republican Party, and the Whig Party were major parties. These six parties have nominated candidates in the vast majority of presidential elections, though some presidential elections have deviated from the normal pattern of two major party candidates. In most elections, third party and independent candidates have also sought the presidency, but no such candidates have won the presidency since the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, and only two such candidates have finished second in either the popular vote or the electoral vote.

==Pre-12th Amendment: 1789–1800==

Prior to the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, each member of the Electoral College cast two votes, with no distinction made between electoral votes for president and electoral votes for vice president. Under these rules, the individual who received the most electoral votes would become president, and the individual who received the second most electoral votes would become vice president.

The following candidates received at least one electoral vote in elections held before the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804. Winning candidates are bolded. Political parties began to nominate presidential candidates in the 1796 presidential election, and candidates are listed as members of the Democratic-Republican Party (DR) or the Federalist Party (F) for the 1796 and 1800 elections.


==Post-12th Amendment: 1804–present==

Since the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, each member of the Electoral College has cast one vote for president and one vote for vice president, and presidential candidates have generally competed on a ticket with a running mate who seeks to win the vice presidency. Since 1824, the national popular vote has been recorded, though the national popular vote has no direct effect on the winner of the election.

The following candidates won at least 0.1% of the national popular vote in elections held since 1824, or won at least one electoral vote from an elector who was not a faithless elector.

*† and bolded indicates a winning candidate
*‡ indicates a losing candidate who won a plurality or majority of the popular vote
*↑ indicates a third party or independent candidate who finished second in the popular vote or the electoral vote (or both)
*§ indicates a pending election that hasn&#x27;t been fully confirmed

<text>PG Tips is a brand of tea in the United Kingdom manufactured by Lipton Teas and Infusions.

==Brand name==
In the 1930s, Brooke Bond launched PG Tips in the tea market in the United Kingdom under the name Pre-Gestee, a variant of the original name &quot;Digestive Tea.&quot; The name implied that it could be drunk as a digestive aid prior to eating food. Grocers and salesmen abbreviated it to &quot;PG.&quot;

Following the Second World War, labelling regulations ruled out describing tea as aiding digestion—a property that had been attributed to tea—and by 1950–1951 the PG name was adopted. The company added &quot;Tips&quot; referring to the fact that only the tips (the top two leaves and bud) of the tea plants are used in the blend.

==Products==
The Brooke Bond name has now been dropped from all packaging and the product is now known as PG Tips. PG Tips is available as loose tea, tea bags, and in vending formats. A &quot;Special Blend&quot; tea, which is the same as the tea blended for the brand&#x27;s 75th anniversary, is available in tea bag form only. The tea used in PG Tips is imported in bulk as estate teas from around the world and blended in precise proportions set by the tea tasters to make blend 777, which can contain between 12 and 35 estate teas (depending on the season, etc.) at the Trafford Park factory in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester.

PG Tags, tea bags with a string, were launched in 1985. Tetrahedron-shaped tea bags, branded as &quot;Pyramid Bags,&quot; launched in 1996. The tetrahedral bag was designed to help the tea leaves move more freely, as loose tea moves in a teapot, and supposedly create a better infusion. One 2011 version of the product packaging made the claim: &quot;The PG Tips pyramid tea bag gives the tea leaves 50% more room to move around than a flat conventional tea bag. So the tea bag works more like a miniature teapot. This allows for all the freshness to be released for the best-tasting cup of PG.&quot; During the T-Birds era, the tetrahedral tea bags were remade with a &quot;freeflow&quot; material to allow further infusion of the tea.
In Scotland, Lipton Teas and Infusions sells a specially developed blend of PG called Scottish Blend. It is marketed as being specially blended to optimise taste in the soft waters of Scotland.

In Ireland, Lipton Teas and Infusions sells tea under the Lyons brand.

As of 2011, a &quot;Special Moments&quot; range was released, initially as the &quot;New Ones.&quot; These teas were made by pressing the leaves at different stages. In 2014, Unilever introduced a new range of fruit, herbal, and green teas under the PG Tips brand.

In 2023, PG Tips announced the creation of a quick-brew teabag that could brew a cup of tea in 60 seconds. This resulted in the teabags being &quot;the market&#x27;s only square tea bags,&quot; at the cost of discontinuing the pyramid bags.

==Advertising==
Unlike the blended teas many companies were producing, Brooke’s teas were pure, high quality teas from India and China. Brooke realised the importance of advertising early on, introducing the slogan, &quot;Good tea unites good company, exhilarates the spirits, banishes restraint from conversation and promotes the happiest purposes of social intercourse.&quot;

===The Tipps family (1956–2002)===
In 1956, PG Tips began using anthropomorphic chimpanzees in their television advertisements. These were dressed in human clothes in the fashion of chimpanzees&#x27; tea party and were known as the &quot;Tipps family.&quot; Their voices were often provided by celebrities, such as Peter Sellers, Donald Sinden and Bob Monkhouse. By 1958, PG Tips had risen from fourth to first place in the British tea market. The chimpanzees were from Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire.

These advertisements were stopped in the 1970s after complaints made by animal rights organisations. However, the chimpanzees were brought back 18 months later when sales began to drop. The last &#x27;Tipps family&#x27; advert was broadcast in January 2002. The PG Tips chimpanzees spawned a spinoff in memorabilia which include trading cards and figurines. Prior to the chimpanzee-inspired cards, PG Tips had included trading cards modelled on cigarette cards, but targeted at children. Production of these ceased in 1999 for unknown reasons.

===The T-Birds (2002–2005)===
The &quot;Tipps family&quot; were replaced in January 2002, with a house-sharing group of claymation birds called the T-Birds (which consisted of Tom the owl, Maggie the pigeon, Pete the starling, and Holly the blue tit), animated by Aardman, the company behind Wallace and Gromit and &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. In Ireland, these commercials were still airing by the end of 2006, though advertising Lyons Tea (another Unilever brand), even though Holly was renamed as Niamh to fit in with Irish audiences.

This led to PG Tips becoming a major partner with Wallace and Gromit&#x27;s first film &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, launched in October 2005. PG offered Gromit mugs on pack in the supermarket. According to &quot;The Grocer&quot; magazine, Unilever reported that during the Gromit mug promotion, PG Tips sales increased 600%. Wallace and Gromit also appeared in an advert with Lady Tottington (another character from the film) around the same time.

In 2005, PG Tips celebrated its 75th anniversary with special packs, including a limited-edition Golden pack, and a one-off Diamond tea bag. The Diamond tea bag cost £7,500, and was made by Boodles jewelers and used Makaibari Silver Tips (Imperial).

===Monkey (2007–2024)===

In January 2007, PG Tips reunited Johnny Vegas as Al and the ITV Digital Monkey character made by Paul Jomain, puppeteered by Nigel Plaskitt and Susan Beattie, and voiced by Ben Miller. ITV Digital had used the Monkey character in its own advertising but had entered administration in March 2002. In the end, ITV Digital’s former terrestrial multiplexes were taken over by Crown Castle and the BBC to create the Freeview free-to-air service. The first commercial was titled &quot;The Return&quot;, and saw Monkey returning to Al&#x27;s house on a dark and stormy night, seeking to reignite their friendship after five years on the run. The Monkey character pointedly explains in said commercial that he is not a chimpanzee, he is a monkey, a nod to PG Tips&#x27; chimpanzee family.

One of the adverts was a spoof of the &quot;deli scene&quot; from the movie &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;. In the advert, Monkey describes the taste of PG Tips by saying &quot;Oh Yes&quot; repeatedly similarly like in the movie. The advert then moves to a scene with a woman at a nearby table asking the waiter &quot;I&#x27;ll have whatever he&#x27;s having&quot;. The advert ends with the tagline &quot;How would you describe the taste?&quot; It was first shown on 3 February 2010.

Another advert, promoting the naturally occurring theanine in PG Tips, featured Monkey and Al playing the characters of Captain Mainwaring and Private Pike from the popular sitcom Dad&#x27;s Army.

When PG Tips released the &quot;Special Moments&quot; range (initially &quot;The New Ones&quot;), another advert was released to advertise the &quot;Fresh&quot; one. It featured Monkey and Al out rambling. Monkey says to Al that they need a cup of the &quot;Fresh&quot; one. Al takes so long to decide how the tea tastes that before he can come to a conclusion, Monkey has been swept away by an eagle. This advert was later modified showing Monkey being dropped off in the eagle&#x27;s nest with the four flavours of the Special Moments range, as well as two eagle chicks next to him.

After the US federal decision in support of same-sex marriage in 2015, PG Tips depicted its Monkey character under the rainbow flag in a message of support for gay marriage, which received some criticism for being a political statement.

In 2015, as part of a rebrand, adverts featured Monkey observing absurd things and deciding to &quot;Keep it tea.&quot;

In 2017, PG tips, Unilever, and software company Ubisend worked together to bring the Monkey persona to life through a Facebook Messenger chatbot for the Red Nose Day charity. For over three weeks leading up to Red Nose Day, Facebook Messenger users could message Monkey and interact with him through his chatbot. Monkey also delivered one daily joke to each of his chatbot users at tea time with the goal of raising One Million Laughs for Comic Relief.

In May 2024, PG Tips officially retired the Monkey character, stating that he was having a &quot;well-deserved retirement&quot;.

===&quot;A Tale of Two Continents&quot;===

A short film entitled &quot;A Tale of Two Continents&quot; was released in March 2008. It is an adventure film parody, starring Monkey &quot;wanting to change the world one tea at a time&quot;. It was shown in cinemas from 21 March 2008 until 10 April, before the showings of family films such as &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;

It was also given free in special limited edition versions of PG Tips in early 2008 as an EcoDisc, a type of DVD that is thinner and more flexible due to it being made of a single layer of polycarbonate, instead of two layers. The limited edition package also featured a teatowel of the EcoDisc cover described as the &quot;official merchandise&quot; of the film.

==PG Tips and public campaigns==
In May 2007, Unilever became the first company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner. To that end, the company asked the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO to start certifying tea estates in East Africa. Since April 2012, all of the tea used in PG Tips has been Rainforest Alliance certified.

In February 2011, PG Tips stated it would stop testing its teas on animals.

In February 2023, the BBC reported that an investigation had found more than 70 women had been sexually abused on tea farms in Kenya that supply PG Tips.

<doc id="971806" wikidata="Q1251978" url="?curid=971806" title="Douglas Albert Munro">
<text>Douglas Albert Munro (October 11, 1919 – September 27, 1942) was a United States coast guardsman who was posthumously decorated with the Medal of Honor for an act of &quot;extraordinary heroism&quot; during World War II. He is the only person to have received the medal for actions performed during service in the Coast Guard.

Munro was born in Canada to an American father and a British mother, and his family moved to the United States when he was a child. He was raised in South Cle Elum, Washington, and attended Central Washington College of Education before volunteering for military service shortly before the United States entered World War II. Munro and his shipmate Raymond Evans were known as the Gold Dust Twins, so-called because they were inseparable.

During the Guadalcanal Campaign, Munro was assigned to Naval Operating Base Cactus at Lunga Point, where small boat operations were coordinated. At the Second Battle of the Matanikau in September 1942, he led the extrication of a force of Marines whose position had been overrun by Japanese forces. He died of a gunshot wound at age 22 while using the Higgins boat that he was piloting to shield a landing craft filled with Marines from Japanese fire.

Several ships, buildings, and monuments have been dedicated to Munro, and a street in his hometown is named after him. The anniversary of his death is annually observed in Cle Elum and at Coast Guard Training Center Cape May. His grave has been designated a historical site by Washington state. He is the namesake of the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building, Munro Hall at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the &quot;Douglas Munro March&quot;, the Navy League&#x27;s Douglas A. Munro Award, the Coast Guard Foundation&#x27;s Douglas Munro Scholarship Fund, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars&#x27; Douglas Munro–Robert H. Brooks Post. He is the only non-Marine to have his name enshrined on the Wall of Heroes of the National Museum of the Marine Corps.

==Early life and education==

===Family===
Munro&#x27;s father, James Munro (1891–1962), was born in Sacramento, California as James Wilkins. By age eight he had moved to Canada; his divorced mother remarried a Canadian citizen whose surname he took. Munro&#x27;s mother, Edith Fairey (1895–1983), was born in Liverpool, England, and—in childhood—relocated with her family to Canada. James Munro and Fairey married in 1914 at Vancouver&#x27;s Christ Church Cathedral; under U.S. naturalization laws at the time, Fairey automatically assumed American citizenship upon her marriage to Munro.

===Youth, schooling, and enlistment===
Douglas Albert Munro was born on October 11, 1919, in Vancouver, British Columbia. His father repatriated his family from Canada to the United States in 1922, settling in South Cle Elum, Washington, where he was employed as an electrician. Munro was baptized at the Holy Nativity Episcopal Church in South Cle Elum.

In his youth Munro showed a high level of musical aptitude, mastering percussion, trumpet, and harmonica. He performed in a drum and bugle corps sponsored by the American Legion, the Sons of the American Legion Drum and Bugle Corps, eventually becoming the corps&#x27; drillmaster. Munro was also a member of Cle Elum&#x27;s Boy Scout Troop 84. He attended Cle Elum High School, where he was a member of the school&#x27;s wrestling team. Following his 1937 high school graduation, Munro enrolled in the Central Washington College of Education due to its proximity to Cle Elum, so that he could continue performing in the Sons of the American Legion. Munro was a yell king (a male cheerleader) at Central Washington.

In 1939, with the threat of war growing, Munro decided to withdraw from college and enlist in the military. He reportedly told his sister he had chosen the Coast Guard because its primary mission was saving lives. Slightly built, Munro spent the week before his induction eating heavily to meet the Coast Guard&#x27;s minimum weight standard. He spent most of his last night in Cle Elum with his friend Marion &quot;Mike&quot; Cooley, with whom, according to Munro&#x27;s biographer, Gary Williams, he had been &quot;almost inseparable&quot; since childhood.

Munro underwent entrance processing in Seattle, where he met and became friends with Ray Evans. Munro would spend the rest of his Coast Guard career with Evans, and the pair became known to shipmates as &quot;the Gold Dust Twins&quot;.

==Career==


Munro and Evans underwent recruit training at Coast Guard Air Station Port Angeles. They were then assigned to the Treasury-class cutter USCGC &quot;Spencer&quot;, serving aboard the vessel until 1941. During the course of his military service, Munro received consistently high marks on his performance evaluations and—according to Evans—expressed a desire to become a career Coast Guardsman.

===Guadalcanal campaign===
In mid-1941, with tension with Japan on the rise, the U.S. government began emergency mobilization, and transferred the Coast Guard from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of the Navy. Munro and Evans volunteered for reassignment to the attack transport USS &quot;Hunter Liggett&quot;, which was being outfitted and manned by the Coast Guard as part of preparations for War Plan Orange.

By mid-1942, &quot;Hunter Liggett&quot; had been assigned to Transport Division 17, tasked with supporting the Guadalcanal Campaign. In preparation for the planned amphibious operations, Navy personnel began training as small boat handlers under Coast Guard tutelage; owing to the shortage of coxswains, Munro and Evans volunteered to join the training. Prior to the initial landings at the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo, Munro was posted to Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner&#x27;s staff aboard USS &quot;McCawley&quot;. Cross-trained as both a coxswain and a signalman, he was ordered to ferry troops to shore during the third attack wave, then beach his boat and attach himself to a U.S. Marine unit to help manage ship-to-shore communication.

Following the Allied victory at Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo, Munro and Evans were among Coast Guard and Navy personnel who staffed Naval Operating Base (NOB) Cactus at Lunga Point on the northern coast of Guadalcanal. NOB Cactus served as a communication hub between land forces and offshore vessels. Established on August 9 by Coast Guard Commander Dwight Dexter, NOB Cactus is the only known instance of a naval operating base primarily led by Coast Guard personnel. Munro volunteered for assignment at Lunga Point; Dexter was his favorite officer.

According to U.S. Marine Master Sergeant James Hurlbut, Munro and Evans lived at the base in an approximately hut &quot;they had made from packing boxes and scrap material&quot;, which he also described as &quot;quite a swank establishment for Guadalcanal&quot;.

On September 20, 1942, Munro volunteered to lead a small boat search-and-rescue mission seeking to recover the crew of a Navy airplane that had been forced down off Savo Island. During the operation, Munro&#x27;s craft came under intense fire from Japanese shore positions, though he was able to maneuver the boat back to base with only minor injuries to his crew. The downed aircrew was ultimately found and rescued by a flying boat.

On September 27, Lt. Colonel Chesty Puller ordered three companies of Marines to attack the flank of Japanese positions on the west side of the Matanikau River. Munro was placed in charge of two landing craft tank (LCT) and eight Higgins boats tasked with transporting the Marines to their landing points. Preceded by a beach-clearing ship-to-shore bombardment from the destroyer , the amphibious force landed and began moving inland towards its objective. Meanwhile, Munro withdrew his boats to Lunga Point as ordered, carrying with him injured sailors and Marines, among them Navy coxswain Samuel B. Roberts, who had been mortally wounded while using his landing craft to draw Japanese fire away from the Marines.

The U.S. Marine Corps landing force came under attack in a Japanese counteroffensive and quickly found itself encircled on a hill. With the Marines in danger of being overrun, &quot;Monssen&quot; opened fire on the Japanese positions with her caliber guns, managing to clear a narrow corridor to the beach. Using &quot;Monssen&quot;″s signal lamp, Puller ordered the Marines to fight their way to the shore.

At Lunga Point, the landing craft were instructed to return and extract the besieged Marines. Commander Dexter asked Munro and Evans if they would take charge of the mission, to which Munro answered, &quot;Hell yes!&quot; As the boats under Munro&#x27;s charge approached the recovery points, they came under heavy fire from the Japanese at a ridge abandoned by the Marines. Munro used a .30 caliber machine gun aboard his landing craft to direct suppressing fire against the enemy positions as the other boats recovered the Marines. With Japanese troops moving against the beach, Munro piloted his boat closer to shore to act as a shield. Though the initial extraction was successful, one of the LCTs became grounded on a sandbar. Munro directed the other LCT to help extricate the grounded vessel as he maneuvered his own boat to shield the Marines from Japanese fire from the shore. Munro was shot in the base of his skull and lost consciousness.

The LCT was ultimately freed and the boats resumed their withdrawal. When out of range of Japanese forces, Munro briefly regained consciousness before succumbing to his wounds. According to Evans, his dying words were, &quot;Did they get off?&quot; Evans said later that &quot;... seeing my affirmative nod, he smiled with that smile I knew and liked so well, and then he was gone&quot;.

==Burial and decoration==
Munro was buried on September 28, 1942, the day after his death, on Guadalcanal. In a letter to James Munro, Hurlbut described Munro&#x27;s grave as being marked by a wooden cross constructed by Evans.

According to Munro&#x27;s biographer, Williams, the public details of Munro&#x27;s actions were first chronicled in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; on October 15, 1942, though initial reports did not reveal Munro had been killed in action. Four days later, Coast Guard officers arrived at the home of Munro&#x27;s parents in South Cle Elum to inform them of his death. A memorial service was held on November 1 at the Holy Nativity Episcopal Church in South Cle Elum. The Washington State Guard and American Legion volunteers provided sentries and a cordon of honor outside the church.

Colonel Puller, the Marine officer who had ordered the attack in which Munro perished, nominated the Coast Guardsman for the Medal of Honor, the highest U.S. personal military decoration. The nomination was endorsed by Admiral William Halsey Jr., and President Franklin Roosevelt approved the decoration on or about May 1, 1943. The medal was presented to Munro&#x27;s parents on May 24 by Roosevelt in a White House ceremony. The citation reads:

For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as Officer-in-Charge of a group of Higgins boats, engaged in the evacuation of a Battalion of Marines trapped by enemy Japanese forces at Point Cruz, Guadalcanal, on September 27, 1942. After making preliminary plans for the evacuation of nearly 500 beleaguered Marines, Munro, under constant risk of his life, daringly led five of his small craft toward the shore. As he closed the beach, he signaled the others to land, and then in order to draw the enemy&#x27;s fire and protect the heavily loaded boats, he valiantly placed his craft with its two small guns as a shield between the beachhead and the Japanese. When the perilous task of evacuation was nearly completed, Munro was killed by enemy fire, but his crew, two of whom were wounded, carried on until the last boat had loaded and cleared the beach. By his outstanding leadership, expert planning, and dauntless devotion to duty, he and his courageous comrades undoubtedly saved the lives of many who otherwise would have perished. He gallantly gave up his life in defense of his country.

To date, Munro is the only member of the U.S. Coast Guard to have received the Medal of Honor.

Munro&#x27;s remains were recovered from Guadalcanal in 1947 and were reinterred at Laurel Hill Memorial Park in Cle Elum in 1948, his family having declined a full military burial at the Arlington National Cemetery. In 1954, the City of Cle Elum expanded Munro&#x27;s gravesite with the installation of two decommissioned Mk22 naval deck guns to either side of the tombstone. Munro&#x27;s parents were later buried on either side of their son&#x27;s grave at Laurel Hill. The entire site has since been added to the Washington Heritage Register as the Douglas Munro Burial Site.

==Personal life==
Munro had a sister, Patricia, who attempted to enlist in the Coast Guard Women&#x27;s Reserve following her brother&#x27;s death but was rejected as she was underweight. Patricia&#x27;s son, Douglas Sheehan, was named after her brother and joined the Coast Guard Reserve, retiring at the rank of commander.

At the time of Munro&#x27;s death, according to a shipmate, he had a girlfriend. Munro also had a maternal cousin serving in the Royal Canadian Navy who was among those killed in the sinking of HMCS &quot;Guysborough&quot; when she was torpedoed by &quot;U-868&quot; in 1945.

==Legacy==

===Monuments and memorials===
Three United States warships have been named after Munro: the destroyer escort , and the cutters and . As of 2018, USCGC &quot;Munro&quot; (WMSL-755) is in active Coast Guard service. It was commissioned in 2017 with Julie Sheehan—Munro&#x27;s great-niece—serving as the ship&#x27;s sponsor.

Three Coast Guard facilities are named in honor of Munro: Munro Hall at the United States Coast Guard Academy, Munro Hall at United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May, and the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building in Washington, D.C. The Munro headquarters building was named by an act of Congress and opened in 2013. The act to designate the Coast Guard headquarters in tribute to Munro was introduced by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Delegate of the District of Columbia to the United States, and co-sponsored by United States Congressmen Duncan Hunter, John Garamendi, and Lou Barletta.

Several monuments have also been erected to Munro, including a bronze statue at Coast Guard Training Center Cape May (&quot;Douglas Munro&quot; by Carey Boone Nelson), a larger-than-life bust at the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters (&quot;Douglas Munro&quot; by John Tuomisto-Bell and Tyson Snow), a black marble pillar etched with Munro&#x27;s visage at the Coast Guard Academy, a memorial marker at the Point Cruz Yacht Club in Honiara in the Solomon Islands, and a monument in Crystal River, Florida. In 2006, Munro was added to the Wall of Heroes of the National Museum of the Marine Corps, becoming the only non-Marine represented on it.

In Cle Elum, Washington, Munro is commemorated by Douglas Munro Boulevard.

===Observances===
At Coast Guard Training Center Cape May, recruit classes are annually assembled at the statue &quot;Douglas Munro&quot; on the anniversary of Munro&#x27;s death, during which three-volleys are fired.

July 24, 2009, was declared Douglas Munro Memorial Day in the State of Washington by Governor Christine Gregoire.

====Cooley flagpole at the Douglas Munro Burial Site====
For several decades, Munro&#x27;s boyhood friend Mike Cooley raised and lowered the United States flag at Munro&#x27;s gravesite, daily walking three miles from his home to the cemetery. According to Cooley&#x27;s daughter, for over 30 years he never missed a day, even when he was ill with pneumonia. Upon his death in 1999, a lighted flagpole dedicated to Cooley was installed to allow the U.S. colors to be displayed continuously at Munro&#x27;s grave without the need to be lowered at dusk. Cooley was cremated and his ashes interred at the Douglas Munro Burial Site with the remains of the Munro family.

Since the dedication of the new flagpole, an annual military ceremony has been held at the gravesite on the anniversary of Munro&#x27;s death. The 75th anniversary ceremony, held in 2017, was attended by Commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral Paul Zukunft.

===Other===
In 1989 the Coast Guard commissioned the painting &quot;Douglas A. Munro Covers the Withdrawal of the 7th Marines at Guadalcanal&quot; from Bernard D&#x27;Andrea.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Cle Elum is named the Douglas Munro-Robert H. Brooks VFW Post 1373, and the Anacostia chapter of the Surface Navy Association is officially named the Douglas Munro Chapter. The Douglas A. Munro Award, established in 1971 and sponsored by the Navy League of the United States, is annually presented to an enlisted Coast Guardsman &quot;who has demonstrated outstanding leadership and professional competence to the extent of their rank and rate&quot;. The &quot;Douglas Munro March&quot;, composed by Lewis J. Buckley, was debuted by the United States Coast Guard Band on September 26, 1982, at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. In 2014, the Coast Guard Foundation established the Douglas Munro Scholarship Fund. University scholarships from the fund are awarded to the children of U.S. Coast Guard personnel.

Several members of Munro&#x27;s extended family have been named Douglas as a familial tribute to Munro. The former Washington Secretary of State, Ralph Munro, who is not related to Douglas Munro, has said he frequently visits Munro&#x27;s grave for personal reflection.

== Ratings ==

== Decorations ==
As well as the Medal of Honor, Munro was awarded the Purple Heart, the Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with one battle star), and the World War II Victory Medal.

<doc id="971810" wikidata="Q930720" url="?curid=971810" title="Roger Godement">
<text>Roger Godement (; 1 October 1921 – 21 July 2016) was a French mathematician, known for his work in functional analysis as well as his expository books.

==Biography==
Godement started as a student at the École normale supérieure in 1940, where he became a student of Henri Cartan. He started research into harmonic analysis on locally compact abelian groups, finding a number of major results; this work was in parallel but independent of similar investigations in the USSR and Japan. Work on the abstract theory of spherical functions published in 1952 proved very influential in subsequent work, particularly that of Harish-Chandra. The isolation of the concept of square-integrable representation is attributed to him. The Godement compactness criterion in the theory of arithmetic groups was a conjecture of his. He later worked with Jacquet on the zeta function of a simple algebra.

He was an active member of the Bourbaki group in the early 1950s, and subsequently gave a number of significant Bourbaki seminars. He also took part in the Cartan seminar.
His book &quot;Topologie Algébrique et Théorie des Faisceaux&quot; from 1958 was, as he said, a very unoriginal idea for the time (that is, to write an exposition of sheaf theory); as a non-specialist, he managed to write an enduring classic. It introduced the technical method of flasque resolutions, nowadays called Godement resolutions. It has also been credited as the place in which a comonad can first be discerned.

He also wrote texts on Lie groups, abstract algebra and mathematical analysis.

<doc id="971830" wikidata="Q16029954" url="?curid=971830" title="Murder of Vera Page">
<text>The murder of Vera Page is a British unsolved child murder case from the early 1930s. On 14 December 1931, 10-year-old Vera Page was reported missing after she failed to return to her home in Notting Hill, London, from a visit to a nearby relative. The child&#x27;s body was found two days later in undergrowth in nearby Addison Road. Vera had been raped, then manually strangled to death in a murder described by one detective as &quot;the most terrible in which I had to deal with during my career&quot;.

Strong physical and circumstantial evidence existed attesting to the guilt of a 41-year-old labourer named Percy Orlando Rush, whose parents lived in the same house as Vera. However, at a coroner&#x27;s inquest held on 10 February 1932, a jury determined that insufficient real evidence existed to formally charge Rush with her murder. Officially, the case remains unsolved.

==Early life==
Vera Isobel Minnie Page was born on 13 April 1921 in Hammersmith, London, the only child born to Charles and Isabel Page. The Page family were working-class. Vera&#x27;s father was employed as a painter with Great Western Railways and her mother was a housewife. Vera has been described as a popular yet shy and well-behaved girl.

To supplement the family income, Charles and Isabel occasionally allowed lodgers to reside in their home, although these lodgers were always either family members or individuals known to the family. In January 1931, the Page family moved from Chapel Road, Notting Hill (now known as St. Marks Place), to a three-storey house in nearby Blenheim Crescent. The family did not occupy the whole house, but rooms on both the ground floor and basement. Other occupants who resided on the upper floors of this property included a middle-aged couple named Arthur and Annie Rush, who had lived within the property for approximately twenty years.
==Disappearance==
On 14 December 1931, Vera left her home at 22 Blenheim Crescent at 4:30 p.m. to walk approximately fifty yards to the home of her aunt, Minnie, who lived at number 70 Blenheim Crescent. The purpose of this short journey was to collect two swimming certificates she had been awarded but had left with her aunt the previous day. When Vera had not returned home by 5:30 p.m., her father paid a visit to her aunt, who informed him Vera had collected her swimming certificates and then left her home at approximately 4:45 p.m., intending to return home in time for her evening meal. Having first visited the homes of all of Vera&#x27;s friends and relatives in the hope his daughter may be with an acquaintance, Charles visited Notting Hill police station to report Vera as missing at 10:25 p.m. Assisted by several friends and neighbours, Vera&#x27;s parents continued their search for her throughout the evening and into the morning. The following day, the child&#x27;s physical description was circulated among local police and by the evening of 15 December, local media had been notified of her disappearance.

Via extensive inquiries, investigators determined that at some time between 5 and 6 p.m. on 14 December, Vera had spoken with a school friend as she (Vera) had stood outside a chemist&#x27;s located at the junction of Blenheim Crescent and Portobello Road, and that Vera had informed her friend of her intentions to purchase soap dominoes on prominent display behind the window as a Christmas present for her parents. The friend had noted Vera had been carrying an envelope in her hand, which her aunt confirmed to investigators had contained her swimming certificates. Shortly after this brief conversation, the friend had left Vera standing in front of the chemist&#x27;s window. No other verifiable sightings of the child—alone or in the company of any other individual—could be established after this time.
==Discovery==
On 16 December a milkman discovered Vera&#x27;s body lying in a patch of shrubbery in the front garden of 89 Addison Road, Kensington, close to Holland Park and approximately one mile from her home. The perpetrator had made no serious effort to conceal Vera&#x27;s body, beyond making a brief and rudimentary effort to throw handfuls of earth and leaves upon her remains. This fact led investigators to speculate Vera had likely been murdered close to the location of the discovery of her body, and that the perpetrator either lived locally or held extensive geographical knowledge of the neighbourhood. Furthermore, a worn section of ammonia-stained finger bandage was discovered to be lodged firmly against the inner elbow of her right arm; this evidence was only discovered when Vera&#x27;s body was moved from the crime scene to the mortuary.

Approximately forty hours had elapsed between the time Vera had last been seen alive and the discovery of her remains, yet her body was not rigid, and decomposition was relatively advanced, thus suggesting her body had been stored in a fairly warm environment between the time she had last been seen alive and the discovery of her body. Moreover, it had rained heavily from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. the previous day, and the weather was still generally moist and misty, yet Vera&#x27;s clothing had absorbed very little moisture, and solely in locations where her body had touched the soil at the location of her discovery, leading investigators to opine that the child&#x27;s body could not have lain in the location where she was discovered for more than two hours. This opinion was corroborated by both an occupant of the house who informed investigators that had the body been in the patch of shrubbery before 7:50 a.m., she could not have failed to notice it, and the milkman, who had made his routine delivery to the home at 5:30 a.m. that morning, and was adamant that the body was not lying in this location upon his first visit to the premises.

===Autopsy===
Vera&#x27;s body was examined by an eminent pathologist named Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who concluded that she had been raped, then manually strangled to death shortly after the last confirmed sighting of her alive. Her body bore superficial bruising and a welt mark located upon her neck had been inflicted via a ligature, although this injury had evidently occurred after death. Spilsbury also determined that Vera had been deceased for in excess of twenty-four hours prior to the discovery of her body and that, as evidenced by the advanced state of decomposition of her body given the time lapse between her disappearance and discovery, her body had lain in a warm environment for most of this time. He also discovered traces of soot and coal dust on Vera&#x27;s face, plus spattered candle wax in two locations around her right shoulder and three locations on the shoulder of Vera&#x27;s coat. Furthermore, Spilsbury concurred with the initial police conclusion that the section of ammonia-stained finger bandage found lodged against Vera&#x27;s inner elbow had likely been dislodged from the hand of her murderer as he had deposited her body at the crime scene. The candle wax itself was subsequently discovered to be of a different consistency to all candles within Vera&#x27;s own home.

The consistency of the candle wax discovered on Vera&#x27;s clothing, plus the evident coal dust, led Spilsbury to the conclusion that the girl&#x27;s body had likely been hidden in either a coal shed or cellar prior to her body being discarded at Addison Road, and that this shed or cellar most likely had no electric light.

==Investigation==
Vera&#x27;s murder caused extensive public indignation and police mounted an intensive operation to apprehend her murderer, conducting extensive door-to-door inquiries throughout the vicinity of her disappearance and discovery and launching media appeals to the public for information. Over 1,000 people would be formally questioned in relation to the murder, and several thousand witness statements obtained by police throughout their subsequent inquiries.

As Vera was a shy child, investigators theorised she had likely been abducted and murdered by an individual she had known and trusted, and that this individual had lured her to a warm room where he had proceeded to rape and murder her before stowing her body in a coal cellar, as indicated by the extensive coal dust upon her clothes. This individual had subsequently retrieved Vera&#x27;s body from the coal cellar at or shortly before dawn on 16 December and proceeded to transport her body to Addison Road, inadvertently removing the finger bandage from his little finger as he removed his hands from beneath the child&#x27;s arms. A Mrs. Margaret Key informed investigators that at approximately 6:40 a.m. on 16 December, she had observed an individual whose physical appearance fitted that of a local man named Percy Orlando Rush pushing a wheelbarrow laden with a large bundle covered with a distinctive red table-cloth with a knitted fringe walking in the direction of Addison Road.

The day following the discovery of Vera&#x27;s body, a woman living close to Addison Road named Kathleen Short brought a child&#x27;s red beret to the Notting Hill police station, stating she had found the item at approximately 9:30 the previous evening at a location investigators noted was quite close to where Vera had last been seen alive. This beret was identified by Vera&#x27;s parents as belonging to their daughter, and was noted to smell of paraffin (although this odour may have been caused by Short initially storing the beret beneath a sink in her scullery). Short also informed investigators that close to the scene of her discovery, she had also located several sections of torn paper which she had collected and discarded, and a section of candle which she had herself used and then also discarded. By 21 December, police inquiries had also produced an eyewitness who stated that on the morning of the discovery of Vera&#x27;s body, the door to a coal shed close to Addison Road had been left unlocked and ajar, when on all other dates it would invariably have been closed and locked.

The coal cellar in question, located close to the house on Addison Road where Vera&#x27;s body was discovered, had no electric light, giving credibility to Spilsbury&#x27;s theory that the child had either been murdered, and/or her body stored, in a basement or coal cellar with no electric light, and that her murderer had likely illuminated the scene via candlelight. Investigators gave strong support to the theory that the girl&#x27;s body had been temporarily concealed in this cellar after her murder, then transported via wheelbarrow to the location of her subsequent discovery.

==Percy Rush==
Percy Orlando Rush was a 41-year-old married man who lived close to Blenheim Crescent and who had worked as a flannel washer in a launderette in Earl&#x27;s Court for two years. Rush&#x27;s parents lived on the upper floors of 22 Blenheim Crescent, and he and his wife had lived in the premises until 1925, although after their relocation to nearby Talbot Road, he had continued to regularly visit his parents, having a key to their home. Rush freely admitted to having known Vera—whom he described as &quot;a nice little girl&quot;—although he claimed to have not seen her for approximately three weeks before her disappearance.

In Rush&#x27;s occupation he had come into contact with ammonia on an almost daily basis. Furthermore, Rush had injured the little finger on his left hand in his workplace less than a week before Vera&#x27;s murder.

===Formal questioning===
Despite his protestations of innocence, Rush quickly became the prime suspect in Vera&#x27;s murder. He was initially questioned at Notting Hill police station on 18 December, where he freely admitted to having worn a finger bandage since injuring the little finger of his left hand approximately one week previously. According to Rush, after injuring his finger at work in early December he had made a rough bandage for the wound, although his wife had made a more compact and comfortable bandage for him from their domestic supply of bandages that same evening so that the ammonia he came into contact with at work did not aggravate the wound. Nonetheless, Rush claimed to have disposed of this second bandage in his fireplace on 11 December.

Some of Rush&#x27;s claims regarding his finger bandage were confirmed by several of his colleagues, who told investigators Rush had indeed injured the little finger of his left hand on 9 December, and had returned to work the next day wearing a homemade bandage to protect the wound against ammoniated water. Nonetheless, these colleagues were uncertain as to whether he had been wearing the bandage on 14 December.

A search of Rush&#x27;s Talbot Road home had uncovered bandages, plus a distinctive red table-cloth with a knitted fringe which had likely been used to cover Vera&#x27;s body as he had transported her remains from the coal shed to the garden of 89 Addison Road. A forensic examination of the consistency of candle wax discovered upon Vera&#x27;s right shoulder revealed the substance to be identical to that found on a used candle recovered from Rush&#x27;s home and also to wax discovered upon his own overcoat. Furthermore, this overcoat was found to contain traces of coal dust and semen.

The ammonia-soaked finger bandage recovered from the crime scene was found to be a perfect fit upon Rush&#x27;s injured finger, although Rush remained adamant he had not worn any form of bandage upon his finger since 11 December, explaining to investigators he had simply wished to &quot;harden the wound&quot;. Furthermore, Rush freely admitted to having visited his parents at 22 Blenheim Crescent on an almost weekly basis, and to have known Vera, although he remained adamant he had not seen the child for &quot;about three weeks&quot; prior to the date of her disappearance.

The finger bandage recovered at the crime scene was subjected to further forensic analysis by the Home Office analyst, Dr. Roche Lynch, who determined that it had been used to conceal a suppurating wound and that the bandage had been soaked in ammonia on at least one occasion. Nonetheless, Dr. Lynch stated that, having also examined this bandage with the assistance of ultra violet light, he had formed the conclusion that the material was of a different consistency than bandage and lint samples recovered by investigators during their formal search of Rush&#x27;s home.

===Procedural flaw===
A Notting Hill superintendent named George Cornish would later state that during their initial interrogation of Rush when he had simply been one of several potential suspects, officers had informed him of the finger bandage found at the crime scene. Superintendent Cornish would later state that officers had requested Rush to voluntarily hand over all samples of bandages within his home, and he had complied with what Cornish later described as a disturbing &quot;faint smile&quot; upon his face. Shortly thereafter, police conducted their formal search of his home. Superintendent Cornish later confirmed that this procedural error had been a crucial mistake which had likely allowed Rush to dispose of any bandage of the type he had worn on the day of Vera&#x27;s murder.

==Coroner&#x27;s inquest==
Though his movements on the date of the murder were never independently corroborated, at the subsequent coroner&#x27;s inquest held on 10 February 1932, Rush claimed that on 14 December, his wife, Daisy, had been absent from the family home until the early evening and that he had opted to go shopping in Kensington after finishing work as he did not wish to be alone in the family home. He claimed to have returned home at approximately 8:30 p.m. and that his wife had returned home shortly thereafter. The two had gone to sleep at approximately 10:15 p.m. Rush further claimed to have not visited his parents on Monday 14 December, although he did admit that he had typically visited his parents on a Monday. In response to specific allegations from the coroner that he had intentionally lured Vera to the coal shed close to Addison Road where he had then proceeded to rape, then strangle the child to death before later discarding her body in the front garden of 89 Addison Road, Rush became emphatic in his denials, claiming not to have known Vera as well as his initial witness statement to police had suggested and stating he had only ever spoken to Vera once.

No specific eyewitness accounts existed to place Rush in Vera&#x27;s company on the day of her death, and no chemist could recall having sold bandages of the type discovered upon Vera&#x27;s body to Rush. Furthermore, the coal shed in which police alleged Vera had likely been murdered and/or her body stored before being disposed of at 89 Addison Road had been vacated five days before her murder. The previous owner, Thomas O&#x27;Connor, said he had taken the door&#x27;s padlock with him.

===Acquittal===
Ultimately, the jury determined that insufficient evidence existed to formally charge Rush with Vera&#x27;s murder and reached a formal verdict of murder by person or persons unknown after just five minutes of deliberation. In response to this verdict, many women in the gallery openly booed and shook their fists at Rush, vocally declaring him to be a blatant liar.

==Aftermath==
No individual was ever charged with the murder of Vera Page. Percy Rush himself died of natural causes in Ealing in the autumn of 1961.

<text>Rowanburn is a hamlet in Eskdale, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Located near Canonbie, it sits around 5 miles south-east of Langholm and about a mile from the Anglo-Scottish border.

Rowanburn was founded as a coal mining community to house miners from the Canonbie Coalfield in the late 19th century. There is a memorial to the now-closed coal mines in the hamlet. To the south, there is the Riddings Viaduct, a nine-span railway viaduct built in 1864 for the Border Union Railway.

Several farms in the area were devastated by the 2001 foot and mouth crisis which spread rapidly via the local livestock market at Longtown.

The only village shop, and garden centre, closed in 2003.

<text>The Uplift War is a 1987 science fiction novel by American writer David Brin, the third book of six set in his Uplift Universe. It was nominated as the best novel for the 1987 Nebula Award and won the 1988 Hugo and Locus Awards. The previous two books are &quot;Sundiver&quot; and &quot;Startide Rising&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
50,000 years before the events of the novel, the planet Garth was leased to the Bururalli who, imperfectly uplifted, reverted to a pre-sophont state and nearly destroyed its ecosystem by overhunting all large indigenous species. The ecologically sensitive galactic civilization declared a war of extermination and the Bururalli were made extinct. As the youngest clan in galactic civilization, Earthclan is mostly relegated to near-hopeless &quot;recovery worlds&quot; for colonization, and they are granted a lease to inhabit Garth.

The novel begins in the year 2489 C.E. with the avian Gubru planning to invade Garth. The Gubru, a conservative and somewhat humorless alien race, decide to hold Garth hostage in an attempt to learn more about the discovery that the dolphin spaceship &quot;Streaker&quot; made in &quot;Startide Rising&quot; about the Progenitors.

The Gubru overpower Garth&#x27;s token space forces, in the battle a neo-chimp soldier of Earthclan, Fiben Bolger, pilots a small craft that is damaged and crash lands in the mountains. The Gubru engage a small portion of their ground force in ritualistic combat against Earthling forces, and Earthclan successfully defends its legal right to the planet under the standards of Galactic law. However, the Gubru immediately take hostage most of the human population using a pre-planned subterfuge consisting of repeated, wide aerial distribution of a poisonous gas specially formulated to target humans. In order to receive the antidote, the humans must report to island prison camps and agree to be imprisoned during the occupation. The Gubru, used to galactic norms, mistakenly believe that the neo-chimp population on Garth will be easily controlled without their human patrons to guide them.

Taking advantage of resentments that fester among the lower social strata of the neo-chimp population (those with limited rights to breed), the Gubru subvert some of the neo-chimps in and around Port Helenia, the capital city. At the same time, a large group in the mountains, led by Robert Oneagle and Athaclena, engage in guerrilla warfare. Their combination of &quot;wolfling&quot; ingenuity and galactic diplomacy allow them to inflict significant damage, both psychological and physical, on the Gubru. Fiben Bolger, in town on a fact-finding expedition for the Resistance, runs afoul of one of the conspirator neo-chimpanzees known as Irongrip.

Elsewhere on the planet, Athaclena&#x27;s father Uthacalthing, the Tymbrimi ambassador, and the Thennanin ambassador, Kault, are shot down while fleeing the Gubru invasion. The two ambassadors land safely, but must trek several hundred kilometers back to civilization. The Tymbrimi are allies of Earth and well known for a low sense of humor that, along with a yen for surprise, motivates much of their behavior. By contrast, the Thennanin are portrayed as dour, supercilious, protectors of the rights of animals and species. Hoping to fool Kault with an elaborate and ultimately costly practical joke, Uthacalthing secretly instructs a furtive neo-chimp to create false evidence pointing to the existence of Garthlings – a fabled race of pre-sentient creatures that were rumored to have survived the Bururalli holocaust. Uthacalthing also plants evidence about the Garthlings in his &quot;diplomatic cache&quot; – which is, after being disturbed by Fiben Bolger, stolen by the Gubru. Unknown to him, some renegade humans have already been illegally beginning the uplift process of gorillas, meaning that there actually is a &#x27;Garthling&#x27; race up for adoption.

The three Gubru co-commanders (suzerains) overreact to most situations. When the Suzerain of Cost and Caution is killed in an accident set up by the neo-chim resistance movement, the other two suzerains exploit the situation and further their own goals. The Suzerain of Propriety seizes on the Garthling myth and builds an enormously expensive &quot;hypershunt&quot; on Garth. If Garthlings can be found, the Gubru will be able to use the hypershunt to adopt and indenture the race for 100,000 years in exchange for uplifting them to sentience. At the same time, the Gubru and others find evidence of secret uplift in the mountains, and come to believe that Earthclan was hiding a secret effort to uplift Garthlings.

The suzerains are unable to resolve their internal power struggles and begin scheming against one another. Fiben Bolger begins to fear that Earthclan&#x27;s well-known naivete at Galactic punctilio could imperil the entire neo-chimpanzee population, both on Garth and on Earth. Some of the key neo-chimpanzee characters are eventually forced to choose between following the legal representatives of the surviving Planetary Government, or to follow their original leaders, Robert Oneagle and the young Tymbrimi Athaclena. Many of the major characters must weigh their personal feelings against patriotic duties and greater responsibilities. There is a trial by combat during the Uplift ceremony between Fiben Bolger and Irongrip for the right to choose patrons for their next stage of Uplift, as the Gubru attempt to co-opt the uplift of the neochimpanzees in order salvage the massive expense of building the hypershunt. In the end, Uthacalthing&#x27;s joke succeeds beyond his wildest imaginings, as the partially uplifted gorillas suddenly come forward as Garthlings and indicate their willingness to be uplifted by the Thennanin, with Humans and Neo-Chimpanzees as their consorts (races tasked to ensure that uplift is not mishandled or abused). Athaclena and the remaining resistance fighters come down from the mountains and deliberately assemble in an exposed position, showing their willingness to die rather than allow further acts of war to damage Garth&#x27;s already damaged ecosystems. The Suzerain of Beam and Talon orders his soldiers to destroy them, but they disobey and kill him, and the Gubru leave Garth in shame. As the book comes to an end, Uthacalthing&#x27;s maneuverings have brought desperately needed assistance to Earthclan and its allies out on the starlanes, as the Thennanin and their allies join the conflict on Earthclan&#x27;s side.

== Characters ==
*Humans
**Robert Oneagle - Playboy son of the Planetary Coordinator, who enters into a complicated interspecies relationship with the Tymbrimi teenager Athaclena as well as being one of two free humans left alive and uncaptured on the surface of Garth. He undergoes a tremendous physical and mental change over the course of the book as the invasion occurs and he becomes almost the last free human on Garth.
**Megan Oneagle - Planetary coordinator of Garth, who finds herself powerless in an undersea redoubt after the Gubru arrive, with all plans for organized resistance foiled by the Gubru&#x27;s gas attack.
**Major Prathachulthorn - Professional soldier who assumes command on reaching the Mulun mountains resistance enclave, but causes problems with his hatred of all non-Earth intelligent species, and condescending attitude towards chimps.
**Lydia McCue - Prathachulthorn&#x27;s second-in-command.
*Neo-Chimpanzees
**Fiben Bolger - A chimp with the commission in the planetary militia. Friend of Robert Oneagle. Plays a large role in the resistance effort.
**Sylvie - Female chimp who initially collaborates with the invaders.
**Gailet Jones - Female chimp, graduate student at the planetary university. Leads a branch of the resistance after invasion.
**Max - Member of the Resistance, a chen, and former servant to Gailet Jones
**Irongrip - a probie (probationary) chen outcast
*Galactics
**Athaclena - Tymbrimi. Uthacalthing&#x27;s daughter. Engaged in a consort (contract) with Robert Oneagle.
**Uthacalthing - Tymbrimi. The tymbrimi are humanoid in shape and partially in anatomy. They have two features that make them distinct among the Galactics: their adaptation hormones and their corona. The corona is a set of tentacular threads emitting from the head upward, it is a probability organ fitted to construct emotional glyphs that convey a specific emotion. These glyphs then can take on a mind of their own, in a sense, as certain ones are used for everything from scouting other creatures in the dark to trying to implant a thought in someone else&#x27;s mind. The adaptation hormones are a special ability they have; under physical stress, the body releases a flood of hormones to the parts of the body, causing the stress and alters them. It can make skin thicker, nails harder and longer, widen the nostrils for better air intake, change the placements of nerve endings and body part placements, etc. Also, the tymbrimi feature a rather unusual quality among galactics; they are tricksters. They play practical jokes on each other as a part of their civilization, and have an extraordinary sense of humor, much like humans but 100-fold stronger.
**Kault - Thennanin ambassador to Garth. Kault finds himself on an epic walking journey with Uthacathling, who is frustrated by the Thannanin&#x27;s near immunity to psi and Tymbrini glyphs.
**Gubru - A race of avian (birdlike) creatures governed by the Triumvirate, 3 selected officials representing the army, church, and economy of their race. The Triumvirate are all un-sexed until they reach the mating consensus, meaning that all three officials need to reach complete agreement on all three subjects before one of them is able to become a female or queen (highest in status).
**Kwackoo - Another avian race, clients of the Gubru. They mainly serve in support roles for the Suzerains, to whom they are fiercely loyal.

<text>Harpetida is one of the eleven orders of the extinct arthropod class Trilobita. The first harpetid trilobites appear in the Upper Cambrian, and the last species die out at the end of the Devonian period.

Harpetid trilobites are characterized among trilobites by bearing a comparatively large, semicircular brim around the cephalon (head) which is often perforated by small pores. This brim is thought to serve as a filter-feeding apparatus. The brim stretches backward on either side of the cephalon (head) and typically has a pronounced suture along the outside.

The compound eyes are typically reduced to small tubercles, though they have strong ridges stretching to the glabella (central region of the cephalon). They also typically have 12 or more thoracic segments. The pygidia are usually small.

The families of Harpetida were formerly included in the order Ptychopariida, but were recently given their own order (Ebach &amp; McNamara 2002). The subclass Librostoma was erected in 1990 by Richard Fortey to cover the various orders originally placed within Ptychopariida. The name &quot;Harpidae&quot; was once used as the name for the trilobite family containing the type genus &quot;Harpes&quot;. However, this is in conflict with the use of the same name for the family of harp snails and that taxon had precedence.

<text>Sir Bernard Henry Spilsbury (16 May 1877 – 17 December 1947) was an English pathologist. His cases include Hawley Crippen, the Seddon case, the Major Armstrong poisoning, the &quot;Brides in the Bath&quot; murders by George Joseph Smith, the Crumbles murders, the Podmore case, the Sidney Harry Fox matricide, the Vera Page case, and the murder trials of Louis Voisin, Jean-Pierre Vaquier, Norman Thorne, Donald Merrett, Alfred Rouse, Elvira Barney, Toni Mancini, and Gordon Cummins. Spilsbury&#x27;s courtroom appearances became legendary for his demeanour of effortless dominance.

He also played a crucial role in the development of Operation Mincemeat, a deception operation during the Second World War which saved thousands of lives of Allied service personnel. Spilsbury committed suicide in 1947.

==Personal life==
Spilsbury was born on 16 May 1877 at 35 Bath Street, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. He was the eldest of the four children of James Spilsbury, a manufacturing chemist, and his wife, Marion Elizabeth Joy.

On 3 September 1908, Spilsbury married Edith Caroline Horton. They had four children together: one daughter, Evelyn and three sons, Alan, Peter and Richard. Peter, a junior doctor at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in Lambeth, was killed in the Blitz in 1940, while Alan died of tuberculosis in 1945, shortly after the Second World War.

The deaths (of Peter, in particular) were a blow from which Spilsbury never truly recovered. Depression over his finances and his declining health are believed to have been a key factor in his decision to commit suicide by gas in his laboratory at University College, London, in 1947.

==Career==
Educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, he took a Bachelor of Arts degree in natural science in 1899, an MB BCh in 1905 and a Master of Arts in 1908. He also studied at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Paddington, London, from 1899. He specialised in the then-new science of forensic pathology.

In October 1905, he was appointed resident assistant pathologist at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital when the London County Council requested all general hospitals in its area appoint two qualified pathologists to perform autopsies following sudden deaths. In this capacity, he worked closely with coroners such as Bentley Purchase.

===Noteworthy cases===
The case that brought Spilsbury to public attention was that of Hawley Harvey Crippen in 1910, where he gave forensic evidence as to the likely identity of the human remains found in Crippen&#x27;s house. Spilsbury concluded that a scar on a small piece of skin from the remains pointed to Mrs Crippen as the victim.

Spilsbury later gave evidence at the trial of Herbert Rowse Armstrong, the solicitor convicted of poisoning his wife with arsenic.

The case that consolidated Spilsbury&#x27;s reputation as Britain&#x27;s foremost forensic pathologist was the &quot;Brides in the Bath&quot; murder trial in 1915. Three women had died mysteriously in their baths; in each case, the death appeared to be an accident. George Joseph Smith was brought to trial for the murder of one of these women, Bessie Munday. Spilsbury testified that since Munday&#x27;s thigh showed evidence of goose bumps and, since she was, in death, clutching a bar of soap, it was certain that she had died a violent deathin other words, had been murdered. 
Spilsbury was also involved in the Brighton trunk murder cases. Although the man accused of the second murder, Tony Mancini (real name Cecil Louis England), was acquitted, he confessed to the killing in 1976 just before his own death, vindicating Spilsbury&#x27;s evidence.

Spilsbury was able to work with minimal remains, such as those involved in the Alfred Rouse case (the &quot;Blazing Car Murder&quot;). Here, a near-destroyed body was found in the wreck of a burnt-out car near Northampton in 1930. Although the victim was never identified, Spilsbury was able to give evidence of how he had died and facilitate Rouse&#x27;s conviction.

During his career, Spilsbury performed thousands of autopsies, not only of murder victims but also of executed criminals. He was able to appear for the defence in Scotland, where his status as a Home Office pathologist in England and Wales was irrelevant: he testified for the defence in the case of Donald Merrett, tried in February 1927 for the murder of his mother and acquitted as not proven.

Spilsbury was knighted early in 1923. He was a Home Office-approved pathologist and lecturer in forensic medicine at the University College Hospital, the London School of Medicine for Women and at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital. He also was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine.

In later years, Spilsbury&#x27;s dogmatic manner and his unbending belief in his own infallibility gave rise to criticism. Judges began to express concern about his invincibility in court and recent researches have indicated that his inflexible dogmatism led to miscarriages of justice.

On 17 July 2008, files containing notes on deaths investigated by Spilsbury were auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s and were acquired by the Wellcome Library in London. The files&#x27; index cards documented deaths in the County of London and the Home Counties from 1905 to 1932. The hand-written cards, discovered in a lost cabinet, were the notes that Spilsbury apparently accumulated for a textbook on forensic medicine which he was planning, but there is no evidence that he ever started the book.

==Legacy==
Spilsbury, together with personnel from Scotland Yard, was responsible for devising the so-called murder bag, the kit containing plastic gloves, tweezers, evidence bags, etc., that detectives attending the scene of a suspicious death are now equipped with.

Spilsbury is commemorated by an English Heritage blue plaque attached to his former home at Marlborough Hill in north London, and another at his birthplace, 35 Bath Street, Leamington Spa, which was his father&#x27;s chemist shop and is still a chemist shop today.

===Media===
Spilsbury is mentioned in the Severed Heads song &#x27;Dead Eyes Opened&#x27; by the narrator, Edgar Lustgarten as &#x27;a great pathologist with unique experience&#x27;. The song uses Edgar Wallace&#x27;s transcription of Patrick Herbert Mahon&#x27;s trial for the murder of his lover Emily Beilby Kaye.

In the 1956 film &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;, about Operation Mincemeat, André Morell played Spilsbury.

The BBC science documentary series &quot;Horizon&quot; cast a critical eye on Spilsbury&#x27;s work in the 1970 episode &quot;The Expert Witness&quot;.

In the 1976 Thames Television series &quot;Killers&quot;, Spilsbury was played in three episodes by Derek Waring.

Spilsbury was played by Andrew Johns in the 1980–81 Granada TV series &quot;Lady Killers&quot;.

In P.D. James&#x27; 1986 mystery novel, &quot;A Taste for Death,&quot; a character who is a forensic pathologist is said to be &quot;getting dangerously infallible with juries. We don&#x27;t want another Spilsbury.&quot;

Nicholas Selby played Spilsbury in the 1994 mini-series &quot;Dandelion Dead&quot;, a dramatisation of the Armstrong poisoning case.

On 12 June 2008, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon Drama&quot; play, &quot;The Incomparable Witness&quot; by Nichola McAuliffe, was a drama about the involvement of &quot;Sir Bernard Spilsbury, the father of modern forensics&quot; in the Crippen case as seen from the point of view of Spilsbury&#x27;s wife Edith. The radio play was directed by Sasha Yevtushenko with Timothy Watson as Spilsbury, Joanna David as Edith, Honeysuckle Weeks as the young Edith and John Rowe (who played Spilsbury in an episode of the short-lived 1984 BBC Scotland TV series &quot;Murder Not Proven?&quot;) as the Lord Chief Justice.

In the 2019 musical Operation Mincemeat Jak Malone originated the role of Spilsbury. Christian Andrews, Jonty Peach and Seán Carey have played the role in the West End. Malone will reprise the role on Broadway in 2025. 

In 2019 the BBC1 series &quot;Murder, Mystery and My Family&quot; concluded that the conviction of the then 15-year-old Jack Hewitt (1907–1972) for the murder at Gallowstree Common of Sarah Blake (1877–1922) was unsafe, partly due to Spilsbury&#x27;s misleading evidence to the jury about the putative murder weapon.

Also in 2019 the same series &quot;Murder, Mystery and My Family&quot; concluded that the 1929 conviction of Sidney Fox for matricide was unsafe, partly due to Spilsbury&#x27;s misleading evidence to the jury about the cause of death of Fox’s mother. Note - forensics have come a long way in the last 100 years when Spillsbury was practising.

==Posthumous reputation==
During Spilsbury&#x27;s lifetime, and as early as 1925 after the murder conviction of Norman Thorne, concern began to be expressed by informed opinion about his domination of the courtroom and about the quality of his methodology. The influential &quot;Law Journal&quot; expressed &#x27;profound disquiet&#x27; at the verdict, noting &#x27;the more than Papal infallibility with which Sir Bernard Spilsbury is rapidly being invested by juries.&#x27;.

In more recent years, there has been some reassessment of Spilsbury&#x27;s reputation, which has raised questions over his degree of objectivity. Sydney Smith judged Spilsbury &#x27;very brilliant and very famous, but fallible...and very, very obstinate.&#x27; Keith Simpson wrote of Spilsbury &#x27;whose positive evidence had doubtless led to conviction at trials that might have ended with sufficient doubt for acquittal.&#x27; Burney and Pemberton (2010) noted how the &quot;virtuosity&quot; of Spilsbury&#x27;s performances in the mortuary and the courtroom &quot;threatened to undermine the foundations of forensic pathology as a modern and objective specialism.&quot;

He has in particular been criticised for his insistence on working alone, his refusal to train students, and an unwillingness to engage in academic research or peer review. This, according to the article, &quot;lent him an aura of infallibility that for many raised concerns that it was his celebrity rather than his science that persuaded juries to credit his evidence over all others.&quot;

<text>Histeridae is a family of beetles commonly known as clown beetles or hister beetles. This very diverse group of beetles contains 3,900 species found worldwide. They can be easily identified by their shortened elytra that leaves two of the seven tergites exposed, and their geniculate (elbowed) antennae with clubbed ends. These predatory feeders are most active at night and will fake death if they feel threatened. This family of beetles will occupy almost any kind of niche throughout the world. Hister beetles have proved useful during forensic investigations to help in time of death estimation. Also, certain species are used in the control of livestock pests that infest dung and to control houseflies. Because they are predacious and will even eat other hister beetles, they must be isolated when collected.

==Characteristics==

Hister beetles are easily identified by their protibia which are flattened and toothed and their shortened elytra. Their glabrous elytra are typically black or metallic green. The two main shapes for this family are oval and flat. The elytra are shorter than the abdomen with typically two of the seven tergites exposed. Hister beetles have specialized heads that can retract into their prothorax and two lamellate antennae with clubbed ends. As predators, hister beetles commonly feed on the egg, larval, and adult stages of other insects. Certain species are also used to control livestock pests that infest dung or to control house flies. Histeridae are most active at night and they will play dead if they feel threatened.

==Etymology==

Histeridae was named by Leonard Gyllenhaal. Histeridae has two common names, the &quot;clown&quot; beetle and the &quot;hister&quot; beetle. There have been several theories explaining the origin of these common names. One theory for the &quot;hister&quot; nickname comes from the work of Juvenal, a Roman poet. Juvenal used the word &quot;hister&quot; to mean a dirty, lowly being. Another theory for the origin of this beetle&#x27;s name stems from the fact that in Latin, &quot;hister&quot; means actor.

==Anatomy==
The elytra and forewings are normally well developed in beetles, but in Histeridae the elytra are shortened and rectangular. The shortened elytra expose the final two of the seven tergites. The head has compound eyes, a mandible mouthpart, and shortened antennae. A distinctive characteristic is that the antennae are elbowed and contain three antennomeres that form a club at the end.

Clown beetles have an open circulatory system within its hemocoel, also known as a body cavity. They have a tube shaped heart that spans the length of the body, and use hemolymph as blood. This blood does not contain any oxygen, but carries nutrients throughout the body. Spiracles are located on the abdomen and are the tracheal system of the beetle. Oxygen is brought into the body by spiracles and tiny sacs exchange the oxygen like a mammal&#x27;s lung.

==Habitat==

Hister beetles are found throughout the world in various habitats. Histeridae have been located in North America, Central America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, but each hister beetle occupies certain niches. The beetles live in dung, carrion, dead vegetation, sandy areas, under tree bark, mammal burrows, and ant/termite colonies. Charactertistics of the hister beetle are dependent upon its habitat. For example, the flat hister beetles are found under bark, while the cylindrical beetles are not. The shape of the beetle will vary from species to species.

A remarkable ability of some hister beetles is their capacity to live in close proximity with ants (myrmecophiles) and termites (termitophiles). The hister beetles can live in harmony with the ants or prey on the ants, depending on the species.

Histeridae live in widespread habitats because they feed on other arthropods. As new food sources are introduced into an environment, the predators of that food source will soon follow. Histeridae live in areas where their prey feed. Some examples are mammalian nests where other arthropods scavenge for food or carrion where maggots will arrive.

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest record of the family is &quot;Antigracilus&quot; from the Aptian aged Yixian Formation of China, which was resolved as the sister species to all living members of the family. The oldest crown group representatives are known from the Burmese amber, around 99 million years old, including those belonging to the extant subfamily Haeteriinae, and the living genus &quot;Onthophilus.&quot;

== Feeding habits ==
The larvae and adult forms of Histeridae have been known to feed on dung, carrion, decomposing vegetation, other insects, larvae, and pupae. Hister beetles are able to locate both dung and carrion through olfaction. When found on dung, carrion and vegetation, the hister beetles will feed on the fly larvae found there. The predacious hister beetle will feed on soft-bodied insect eggs and larvae, Diptera in particular. Some species of Histeridae will even feed on other Histeridae.

The majority of Histeridae species prefer dried, decaying habitats.

Some Histeridae species live in an integrated nest with ants and termites. Some species have been found to be fed by the ants, while others simply feed on leftover insect larvae that the ants do not want. In contrast, in their adult stage &quot;Psiloscelis&quot; will actually feed on adult ants.

Because the Histeridae are predacious, they can be utilized as control agents, but must be stored in isolation. The hister beetles have proven useful in both the control of pest flies in poultry houses and pastures, and against pest beetles of stored food products.

==Development==
Histeridae goes through holometabolous development, meaning it goes through four stages of egg, larva, pupa and adult. The larval form does not resemble the adult form and the pupa, non-feeding and has internally developing wings.

===Egg===
The average time of development from egg to adult at 30 °C is 20.5 days. The eggs of most species are off-white and oval in shape. The egg takes on average 3.8±0.02 days to hatch into the first instar larva. The chorion is shiny and smooth. In certain species like &quot;Epierus&quot; or &quot;Platylomalus&quot; it can look pale brown and be leathery in texture.

===Larval===
The larval stage of the beetle typically goes through two instars, and the second instar is the longest stage of its entire development, taking up 39% of overall development time. It takes 5.1±0.1 days on average for the first instar to develop into the second. The larval form of the insect will range in length from three millimeters to several centimeters. They have a membranous body with a limited amount of sclerotization around the head. There is some pigmentation around the body and it is horizontally segmented. The legs are short and do not help much in locomotion. They move mostly through muscular contraction.

===Pupal===
The pupal form of the beetle is similar in appearance to the adult form. They have outer cells produced in the larval stages that are reinforced with proteinaceous cement. This makes their outer shell harder and protects them during this vulnerable stage. While they pupate, they breathe through spiracles on the abdomen. The beetle is non-feeding and immobile in this stage, as their internal structure is breaking down and rebuilding to its adult form. Under good temperature conditions, the hister beetle will stay in the pupal stage for about a week.

===Male and female structures===
The male and female reproductive organs are hidden underneath the last few sternites on the mesosternal (mesosternum) side. The female&#x27;s structure is modified to work as an ovipositor while the male&#x27;s is adapted as a copulatory structure. The female has oviducts that carry the developed eggs from the ovaries to the ovipositor. The males also have a duct that carries the sperm from the testes to the copulatory structure, which stays concealed until copulation. When fertilization takes place, the male leaves enough sperm in the female to fertilize all the eggs in the female&#x27;s ovaries. The excess sperm is kept in a special structure called spermatheca which holds the sperm until the eggs are fully developed.

==Subclades==
There are four subclades of Histeridae that are predators worth mentioning. These subclades are known as:

1. Dendrobites

They have two common body shapes. One is flattened while the other has a more cylindrical appearance. The former usually lives near tree barks. This is because the prey they feed on, fly eggs, are found near tree bark. The latter also feed on insects and prefer to live in forested areas. Species of the cylindrical Dendrobites usually hunt prey that is unique for that species.

2. Geobiotes

This subclade is the most diverse and the largest of the hister predator subclasses. The Geobites&#x27; body structures are generally circular, and they are known for their digging tendencies. This subclass is separated into five more divisions. The members of this subclass live anywhere from the soil, desert, and coast to caves, mammalian burrows, and vegetation. They live in accordance with where their prey lives. One division of the Geobiote feeds on maggots and eggs that are found in forest vegetation or in carrion. Naturally, these are found in heavily forested areas. The second and third divisions hunt for arthropods that feed on dead plant matter. Thus, these types of Geobiotes are found in the sand and burrowed in soil. The fourth type of Geobiotes feed on fly eggs that grow on fresh dung. This division of Geobiotes is found near animal homes such as nests and burrows. The last division of Geobiotes lives in caves. They feed on the mites and other arthropods that occupy the vegetation and fungi found there. This type of Geobiote is known to include species that become blind.

3. Microhisterids

This subclade is the smallest of the four. They live on plant litter and feed on the tiny arthropods found there. Microhisterids, like all other Histeridae, become specialized to hunt their prey and live in their habitats. Like the fifth division of Geobiotes, some Microhisterids are known to be blind as well.

4. Inquilines

This division consists of those Histeridae that live in close proximity with social colonies of arthropods such as ants and termites. Histeridae that live near ants can live in a harmonious or hostile relationship. The hostile hister beetles feed on the ants. The harmonious hister beetles eat the same food as the ants, however they may not be in direct competition for the food. These beetles have an excretory organ that produces an odor telling the ants they mean no harm.

==Current research==
Because members of the family Histeridae can be found on carrion, they have proven to be important in certain forensic investigations. The predacious hister beetles will feed on the various insects on the body, primarily Diptera. To estimate a person&#x27;s time of death, forensic investigators must look at the insects on the body and determine time of colonization. If the Histeridae beetles are present, the investigator can assume that some of the other insects have been eaten by the hister beetles. Due to their importance in forensic entomology, research is continually being conducted on this family&#x27;s life cycle and development, their prevalence in specific locations, and their geographical distribution.

A study was conducted at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey. Forty species of Coleoptera, including the hister beetles, were observed on twelve pig carcasses over a one-year period. The beetles&#x27; distribution and their time of colonization in the various decomposition stages over the year were examined and recorded.

==Importance in forensics==

Forensic entomology is the study of insects related to crime scenes. Insects can be very helpful at a crime scene and give people an idea of what happened and when it happened.

Flesh eating insects arrive at the dead body within a few hours. Certain species of the hister beetles follow shortly behind and prey on the maggots and other arthropods present. Insects that feed on dead bodies increase the rate of decomposition and their mandibular mouth parts can cause excess damage to the body. Insects can also help determine the season the body died in. The hister beetle is more prevalent in spring and summer.

The family Histeridae is very diverse, so different species can be found on the body at different times because of their various feeding habits. This needs to be noted when examining a dead body. They are predacious beetles and arrive when there is material to feed on, like other beetles or maggots. They do not actually feed on the carrion. For example, &quot;Hister quadrinotatus&quot; and &quot;Hister sedakovi&quot; arrive to feed when the carrion is bloat to dry (full of maggots to no maggots). In contrast, &quot;Saprinus pennsylvanicus&quot; arrive at the body first, when it is fresh to late (beginning of decomposition to advanced decomposition).

The hister beetles lay their eggs in dead bodies and over a short period of time they develop into various stages. The Histeridae larvae are destructive and when they hatch they eat the maggots in the dead body. The stage of the beetle and other insects in the body at the time of investigation helps to determine the time of death. &quot;Beetle larvae are ... helpful when determining post-mortem time interval. Beetle larvae often reside in fly breeding resources, and they can be distinguished from fly larvae by the following: Beetle larvae possess a hard, head capsule, often brown in colour. Fly larvae lack a head capsule, instead having distinct, internal, black mouth hooks (cephalopharyngeal skeleton of mouthparts) at the anterior end of their body.&quot; Understanding how long ago the eggs were laid and the time period of the developmental stages is important for determining the time of death.

The hister beetles will hide under the dead body in the soil during the day and come out at night to feed. For this reason, the dead body must be examined at different times of the day. After collecting the hister beetles from a body, isolate them because they are predacious beetles and eat anything in their way.

==Genera and species==
Histeridae is a large and diverse family. There are more than 410 genera and 4,800 described species in Histeridae worldwide, with more than 500 species in North America. The beetles range in size, shape and color. Many of the adults are predacious.

<text>Hawley Harvey Crippen (11 September 1862 – 23 November 1910), colloquially known as Dr. Crippen, was an American homeopath, ear and eye specialist and medicine dispenser who was hanged in Pentonville Prison, London, for the murder of his wife, Cora Henrietta Crippen. He was the first criminal to be captured with the aid of wireless telegraphy.

==Early life and career==
Hawley Crippen was born in Coldwater, Michigan, the only surviving child to Andresse Skinner and Myron Augustus Crippen, a merchant. He was educated first at the University of Michigan&#x27;s homeopathy school, then graduated from the Cleveland Homeopathic Medical College in 1884. After his first wife, Charlotte Jane (née Bell), died of a stroke in 1892, Crippen entrusted his parents, living in San Jose, California, with the care of his son, Hawley Otto (1889–1974).

Having qualified as a homeopath, Crippen started to practice in New York City. In 1894 he married his second wife, Corrine &quot;Cora&quot; Turner (born Kunigunde Mackamotski), a music hall singer who performed under the stage name Belle Elmore. That same year, Crippen started working for prominent homeopath James M. Munyon, moving to London with his wife in 1897 in order to manage Munyon&#x27;s branch office there.

Crippen&#x27;s medical qualifications from the United States were not sufficient to allow him to practise as a doctor in the United Kingdom. He initially continued working as a distributor of patent medicines, while Cora embarked on an ultimately failed stage career and socialised with a number of variety players of the time.

After Crippen was sacked by Munyon in 1899 he worked for other patent medicine companies, ultimately being hired as the manager for the Drouet Institute for the Deaf. There he hired Ethel Le Neve, a young typist, in 1900. By 1905, the two were having an affair. After living at various addresses around London, Crippen and his wife finally moved to No. 39 Hilldrop Crescent, Camden Road, Holloway, where they took in lodgers to augment Crippen&#x27;s meagre income. Cora had an affair with one of these lodgers, and in turn, Crippen took Le Neve as his mistress in 1908.

==Murder and disappearance==

On the evening of 31 January 1910, Cora disappeared following a party at the Crippen residence at Hilldrop Crescent. Crippen claimed that she had returned to the US and later added that she had died and had been cremated in California. Meanwhile, Le Neve moved into Hilldrop Crescent and began openly wearing Cora&#x27;s clothes and jewelry.

Police first heard of Cora&#x27;s disappearance from her friend, the strongwoman Kate &quot;Vulcana&quot; Williams, but began to take the matter more seriously when asked to investigate when two other friends, the actress Lil Hawthorne and her husband/manager John Nash, pressed their acquaintance, Scotland Yard Superintendent Frank Froest. Crippen&#x27;s house was searched, but nothing was found.

Under questioning by Chief Inspector Walter Dew, Crippen admitted that he had fabricated the story about his wife having died, claiming that he did so to avoid personal embarrassment because she had in fact left him and fled to the US with one of her lovers, a music hall actor named Bruce Miller. Dew was satisfied with Crippen&#x27;s story. However, Crippen and Le Neve did not know this and fled in panic to Brussels, where they spent the night at a hotel. The following day, they went to Antwerp and boarded the Canadian Pacific liner , bound for Canada.

The couple&#x27;s disappearance led police to perform further searches of the house. During the fourth and final search, they found the torso of a human body buried under the brick floor of the basement. William Willcox (later Sir William Willcox, senior scientific analyst to the Home Office) found traces of the toxic compound hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine) in the torso. The remains were identified as Cora&#x27;s by a piece of skin from the abdomen; the head, limbs and skeleton were never recovered. Her remains were later interred at the St Pancras and Islington Cemetery, East Finchley.

===Transatlantic arrest===

Meanwhile, Crippen and Le Neve were crossing the Atlantic aboard &quot;Montrose&quot;, with Le Neve disguised as a boy. Captain Henry George Kendall recognised the fugitives and, just before steaming beyond the range of his ship-board transmitter, had telegraphist Lawrence Ernest Hughes send a wireless telegram to the British authorities: &quot;Have strong suspicions that Crippen London cellar murderer and accomplice are among saloon passengers. Mustache taken off growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Manner and build undoubtedly a girl.&quot; Had Crippen travelled third class, he probably would have escaped Kendall&#x27;s notice. Dew boarded a faster White Star liner, , from Liverpool, arrived in Quebec ahead of Crippen, and contacted the Canadian authorities.

As &quot;Montrose&quot; entered the St. Lawrence River, Dew came aboard disguised as a pilot. Canada was then still a dominion within the British Empire. If Crippen, an American citizen, had sailed to the US instead, even if he had been recognised, it would have taken extradition proceedings to bring him to trial. Kendall invited Crippen to meet the pilots as they came aboard. Dew removed his pilot&#x27;s cap and said, &quot;Good morning, Dr. Crippen. Do you know me? I&#x27;m Chief Inspector Dew from Scotland Yard.&quot; After a pause, Crippen replied, &quot;Thank God it&#x27;s over. The suspense has been too great. I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer.&quot; He then held out his wrists for the handcuffs. Crippen and Le Neve were arrested on board &quot;Montrose&quot; on 31 July 1910. Crippen was returned to the UK on board the .

==Trial ==

Crippen was tried at the Old Bailey before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Alverstone, on 18 October 1910. The proceedings lasted four days.

The first prosecution witnesses were pathologists. One of them, Bernard Spilsbury, testified they could not identify the torso remains or even discern whether they were male or female. However, Spilsbury found a piece of skin with what he claimed to be an abdominal scar consistent with Cora&#x27;s medical history. Large quantities of scopalamine were found in the remains, and Crippen had purchased the drug before the murder from a local chemist.

Crippen&#x27;s defence, led by Alfred Tobin, maintained that Cora had fled to the US with Bruce Miller and that Cora and Hawley had been living at the house only since 1905, suggesting a previous owner of the house was responsible for the placement of the remains. The defence asserted that the abdominal scar identified by Spilsbury was really just folded tissue, for, among other things, it had hair follicles growing from it, something scar tissue could not have; Spilsbury observed that the sebaceous glands appeared at the ends but not in the middle of the scar.

Other evidence presented by the prosecution included a piece of a man&#x27;s pyjama top, supposedly from a pair Cora had given Crippen a year earlier. The pajama bottoms were found in Crippen&#x27;s bedroom, but not the top. The fragment included the manufacturer&#x27;s label, Jones Bros. Testimony from a Jones Bros. representative stated that the product was not sold prior to 1908, thus placing the date of manufacture well within the time period of when the Crippens occupied the house and when Cora gave the garment to Hawley the year before in 1909. Curlers, and bleached hair consistent with Cora&#x27;s, were also found with the remains.
Throughout the proceedings and at his sentencing, Crippen showed no remorse for his wife, only concern for his lover&#x27;s reputation. The jury found Crippen guilty of murder after just twenty-seven minutes of deliberations. Le Neve was charged only with being an accessory after the fact and acquitted.

Although Crippen never gave any reason for killing his wife, several theories have been propounded. One was by the late Victorian and Edwardian barrister Edward Marshall Hall, who believed that Crippen was using scopolamine on his wife as a depressant or anaphrodisiac but accidentally gave her an overdose and then panicked when she died. It is said that Hall declined to lead Crippen&#x27;s defence because another theory was to be propounded.

In 1981, several British newspapers reported that Sir Hugh Rhys Rankin claimed to have encountered Le Neve in Australia, where she told him that Crippen murdered his wife because she had syphilis.

===Execution===
Crippen was hanged by John Ellis at Pentonville Prison, London, at 9 am on Wednesday 23 November 1910.

Le Neve sailed to the US before settling in Canada finding work as a typist. She returned to Britain in 1915 and died in 1967. At Crippen&#x27;s request, a photograph of Le Neve was placed in his coffin and buried with him.

Although Crippen&#x27;s grave in Pentonville&#x27;s grounds is not marked by a stone, tradition has it that soon after his burial, a rose bush was planted over it. In the early 2000s, an investigation into Crippen’s case began with DNA expert David R. Foran, Ph.D., and forensic toxicologist John H. Trestrail III, BS Pharm, leading a team looking into the evidence presented by the prosecution. Inconsistencies in the evidence and suppressed documents caused James Patrick Crippen, the closest living male relative of Crippen, to formally request the British government pardon the doctor and repatriate his remains to America.

Before he was executed, Crippen wrote an eerily prophetic letter to Ethel Le Neve. In it, he said, &quot;Face to face with God, I believe that facts will be forthcoming to prove my innocence.&quot; It is claimed that modern forensic science has now fulfilled his prophecy.

==Crippen&#x27;s guilt==
Questions have arisen about the investigation, trial and evidence that convicted Crippen in 1910. Dornford Yates, a junior barrister at the original trial, wrote in his memoirs &quot;As Berry and I Were Saying&quot;, that Lord Alverstone took the very unusual step, at the request of the prosecution, of refusing to give a copy of the sworn affidavit used to issue the arrest warrant to Crippen&#x27;s defence counsel. The judge without challenge accepted the prosecution&#x27;s argument that the withholding of the document would not prejudice the accused&#x27;s case. Yates said he knew why the prosecution did this but – despite the passage of years – refused to disclose why. Yates noted that although Crippen placed the torso in dry quicklime to be destroyed, he did not realise that when it became wet it turned into slaked lime, which is a preservative,&lt;ref name=&quot;pubmed/22030481&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that Yates used in the plot of his novel &quot;The House That Berry Built&quot;.

The American-British crime novelist Raymond Chandler thought it unbelievable that Crippen could be so stupid as to bury his wife&#x27;s torso under the cellar floor of his home while successfully disposing of her head and limbs.

Another theory is that Crippen was carrying out illegal abortions and the torso was that of one of his patients who died and not his wife.

===New scientific evidence===
In October 2007, Michigan State University forensic scientist David Foran claimed that mitochondrial DNA evidence showed the remains found in Crippen&#x27;s cellar were not those of his wife. Researchers used genealogy to identify three living relatives of Cora Crippen (great-nieces). By providing mitochondrial DNA haplotype, researchers were able to compare their DNA with that extracted from a microscope slide containing flesh taken from the torso in Crippen&#x27;s cellar. The original remains were also tested using a highly sensitive assay of the Y chromosome that found the flesh sample on the slide was male.

The same research team also argued that a scar found on the torso&#x27;s abdomen, which the original trial&#x27;s prosecution argued was the same one Mrs. Crippen was known to have, was incorrectly identified. The scientists found hair follicles in the tissue which should not be present in scars, a medical fact which Crippen&#x27;s defence used at his trial. Their research was published in the August 2010 issue of the &quot;Journal of Forensic Sciences&quot;.

However, the new scientific evidence for Crippen&#x27;s innocence has been disputed. In &quot;The Times&quot;, journalist David Aaronovitch wrote: &quot;As to the body being male, well the American team was using a &#x27;special technique&#x27; that is &#x27;very new&#x27; and &#x27;done only by this team&#x27; and working on a single, century-old slide, described by the team leader as a &#x27;less than optimal sample&#x27;&quot;. Foran responded by saying &quot;tests showed unequivocally that the remains were male&quot;.

Traces of the blonde hair found in curlers at the scene are now preserved in the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Crime Museum. Another researcher said they asked to be provided with samples from them for DNA testing, but the request has been denied several times. However, New Scotland Yard was willing to test a hair from the crime scene for a fee, which in turn was rejected by the investigators as &quot;over the top.&quot; Researchers hypothesized that the police planted the body parts and particularly the fragment of the pajama top at the scene to incriminate Crippen. He suggests that Scotland Yard was under tremendous public pressure to find and bring to trial a suspect for this heinous crime. An independent observer points out that the case did not become public until after the remains were found.

In December 2009, the UK&#x27;s Criminal Cases Review Commission, having reviewed the case, declared that the Court of Appeal will not hear the case to pardon Crippen posthumously.

==Media portrayals==

*The case inspired the 1910 Australian play &quot;By Wireless Telegraphy&quot;
* The murder inspired Arthur Machen&#x27;s 1927 short story &quot;The Islington Mystery&quot;, which in turn was adapted as the 1960 Mexican film &quot;El Esqueleto de la señora Morales&quot;.
* The gang defeated by Elsa Lanchester in the H.G. Wells-scripted crime comedy &quot;Blue Bottles&quot; (1928) is revealed to be related to the Crippen case.

* The German 1942 feature film &quot;Doctor Crippen on Board&quot;, directed by Erich Engels, stars Rudolf Fernau in the title role. (A 1958 Engels film &quot;Doctor Crippen Lives&quot; is neither a sequel nor about Crippen.)
* The character of Mr. Pugh in the radio drama &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, by Dylan Thomas, is described as sporting a &quot;nicotine-eggyellow weeping walrus Victorian moustache worn thick and long in memory of Doctor Crippen&quot;. Throughout the play, he obsessively fantasises about murdering his wife, but never attempts to do so.
* The 1961 Wolf Mankowitz-Monty Norman musical &quot;Belle, or The Ballad of Dr Crippen&quot; at London&#x27;s Strand Theatre was based on the case. 
* The British 1962 feature film &quot;Dr. Crippen&quot; stars Donald Pleasence in the title role and Samantha Eggar as Le Neve.
* The British 1968 film &quot;Negatives&quot; features Peter McEnery and Glenda Jackson as a couple whose erotic fantasies involve dressing up as Crippen and Ethel le Neve.
* The American TV series &quot;Ironside&quot; presented an episode (season 2, episode 16, 23 January 1969: &quot;Why the Tuesday Afternoon Bridge Club Met on Thursday&quot;) in which a neurotic man assumed Dr. Crippen&#x27;s identity and committed a similar murder.
* In &quot;Carry On Loving&quot;, which was made and set in 1970, there is a jokily anachronistic reference to the Crippen case: Peter Butterworth appears in Edwardian costume as &#x27;Dr Crippen&#x27;, visiting a marriage bureau to seek a third wife, having dispatched both his first two.
* In the 1972 season of Australian TV soap opera, &quot;Number 96&quot;, a plot line involving the death of Sylvia Vansard (in which her estranged chemist husband and his mistress are the main suspects), deliberately homages the Crippen story. It was referenced in the official synopses provided to the screenwriters.
* In the play &quot;A Tomb With a View&quot; by Norman Robbins, Dr. Crippen is mentioned in a line of dialog.
* The Crippen saga is the basis for 1982&#x27;s &quot;The False Inspector Dew&quot;, a detective novel by Peter Lovesey.
* The 1989 BBC series &quot;Shadow of the Noose&quot;, about the life of barrister Edward Marshall Hall, includes an abortive attempt on Hall&#x27;s part to defend Crippen (played by David Hatton).
* John Boyne wrote the 2004 novel &quot;Crippen – A Novel of Murder&quot;.
* Erik Larson&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; interwove the story of the murder with the history of Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s invention of radio.
* Martin Edwards wrote the 2008 novel &quot;Dancing for the Hangman&quot;, which re-interprets the case while seeking to adhere to the established evidence.
* The PBS series &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; episode &quot;Executed in Error&quot; (2008) explored new findings in the Crippen case.
* Dan Weatherer&#x27;s stage play &quot;Crippen&quot; (2016) explores the life and crimes of Dr. Hawley Crippen while taking into account new evidence and presenting an alternative theory as to who lay buried beneath the cellar floor.
* In The Man in the Brown Suit by Agatha Christie Crippen is mentioned.
* In &quot;A Fantastic Fear of Everything,&quot; when British author Jack&#x27;s literary agent sets up a meeting between him and an American named Harvey Humphries, Jack&#x27;s paranoia leads him to believe he is really Dr. Crippen come back to kill him, based on the shared name and nationality. When Mr. Humphries appears on screen he is the spitting image of Dr. Crippen.
* The episode titled &quot;The London Cellar Murder&quot; of the podcast &quot;Scotland Yard Confidential&quot; focuses on the Crippen case. 
* The Crippen case was popularized in a Music Hall song with the lyrics: “Dr. Crippen, killed Belle Elmore, ran away with Miss Le Neve.  Right across the ocean blue, followed by Inspector Drew. Ships ahoy, naughty boy.”

<text>The Target Acquisition and Designation Sights, Pilot Night Vision System (TADS/PNVS) is the combined sensor and targeting unit fitted to the Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter. Both systems are independent, but housed together.

Lockheed Martin signed the original TADS/PNVS production contract on 30 April 1982, and the first TADS/PNVS system was fielded in 1983.

== Target Acquisition and Designation Sights (TADS) ==
TADS contains stabilized electro-optical sensors, a laser rangefinder and laser target designator. The TADS assembly can rotate +/− 120 degrees in azimuth, +30/−80 degrees in elevation and can move independently of the PNVS. The movements of TADS can be &#x27;slaved&#x27; to the head movements of the helicopter crew to point where they are looking. This allows images from TADS to be projected onto the crew helmet-mounted optical sights, overlaid upon their view of the cockpit and battle space.

TADS contains a thermographic camera and a monochrome daylight television camera. With the improvements planned with M-TADS in the block III level AH-64D, the monochrome TV-camera is planned to be replaced with a full color camera.

It also used to contain direct-view optics (DVO) which the copilot/gunner (CPG) could see through the Optical Relay Tube (ORT). But in recently fielded models of the AH-64D the ORT along with the DVO has been removed as it was rarely used. It has been replaced in the co-pilot&#x27;s cockpit by a third Multi Purpose Display.

== Pilot Night Vision System ==
Mounted above the TADS, the Pilot Night Vision System (PNVS) contains an infrared camera slaved to the head movements of the pilot. PNVS can rotate +/− 90 degrees in azimuth and +20/−45 degrees in elevation. PNVS has a high rate of movement (120° per second) so as to accurately match the head movements of the pilot.

== Arrowhead upgrade ==

As of 2005 a program was under way to upgrade the U.S. Apache fleet to the Modernized-TADS/PNVS (M-TADS/PNVS) standard, also known as Arrowhead. This upgrade is claimed to give a 150% performance and reliability improvement, while reducing costs through lower maintenance requirements.

<text>Fort Blockhouse is a former military establishment in Gosport, Hampshire, England, and the final version of a complicated site. At its greatest extent in the 19th century, the structure was part of a set of fortifications which encircled much of Gosport. It is surrounded on three sides by water and provides the best view of the entrance to Portsmouth Harbour. As HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, the fort was for most of the 20th century the home of the Royal Navy Submarine Service. It is unique in that it was built over five centuries from its original construction as a blockhouse in 1431 to the final addition of submarine base structures in the mid-1960s. 

Coastal fortification was abolished nationally in 1956; the submarines left in the 1990s and the fort has not been used in a military capacity since 2021. The MoD plans to dispose of the site in 2025.

== History ==
===Early fortifications (1431–1667)===
Following the burning of Portsmouth during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, money was set aside in 1417 to provide protection for Portsmouth Harbour. A timber blockhouse was first built on the Gosport side of the harbour in 1431, after authorisation by Henry VI. A chain was strung from Blockhouse point to a similar tower in Portsmouth, which could be raised to prevent entry to the harbour by enemy ships. It was subsequently rebuilt and strengthened, and in 1542 John Leland described it as a round stone tower with ordnance.

Around the year 1539 a &#x27;bulwark&#x27; was built by Thomas Spert to the south-west of the blockhouse (where Haslar Hospital now stands); it was subsequently known as Lymden&#x27;s Bulwark. Further to the south another fort was built in 1545-46 named Haselworth Castle, though this was abandoned only eleven years after construction. The Cowdray engraving of &quot;The Encampment of the English forces near Portsmouth&quot; in 1545 depicts all three structures, with Haselworth still under construction; two years later the 1547 Inventory of Henry VIII lists &#x27;Lymden&#x27;s Bulwark by the West Haven, under Captain John Lymden&#x27; and also &#x27;Hasillworth Castle&#x27;, but the blockhouse is omitted (implying it was no longer armed at this time). By the end of the century all these fortifications were in a derelict state, and a few decades later only a mound remained to indicate the site of the former bulwark.

===Modernised fort (1667–1877)===

In 1665, during the Second Dutch War, Sir Bernard de Gomme was commissioned by Charles II to improve the Portsmouth defences. Two years later he installed a new L-shaped battery on Gosport Point (where the blockhouse had formerly stood): it consisted of a row of eighteen guns facing south-east, to protect the seaward approach to the harbour, and two more guns pointing south-west, so as to protect the landward approach to the battery (which was along a narrow spit of land). The following decade an eighteen-gun battery was constructed by de Gomme alongside the Round Tower on the Portsmouth side of the harbour entrance, matching the battery on the Gosport side. To the north, on the west side of the harbour, de Gomme built two square defensive towers, Charles Fort (at Gosport) and James Fort (on Burrow Island), which were completed by 1679; while on the landward side he began constructing a bastioned trace around the town of Gosport in 1678. 
An inspection in the early 18th century, however, found that the defences had fallen into poor condition; Captain Talbot Edwards (who, as Second Engineer, was made responsible for surveying the Portsmouth fortifications) said of the battery that &#x27;this work like the rest is all gone to ruine&#x27;. Between 1708 and 1714 the battery was completely rebuilt to create a bastioned fort, with a renewed seaward-facing open-air battery to the south-east and significant defensive earthworks to the south-west. The shape of the 18th-century fort can still be discerned and surviving elements of the 1708 works are the oldest still present on the site. The entrance to the fort on the south-west side consisted of a tall gatehouse flanked by two demi-bastions; the gatehouse was demolished in the 1960s, but its keystone survives on site, decorated with the arms of the Board of Ordnance and inscribed &quot;Anno 1708&quot;. The fort was surrounded by a moat on the south-west and south-east sides, the former crossed by a bridge which was protected at its far end by a stone redan and angled outer earthworks. To the north the fort was enclosed by wooden palisades which formed a bastion at the northernmost point. In the 1750s the fort was described as being armed with twenty-one 18 pounder guns and three 6 pounders.
Beyond Fort Blockhouse the Gosport fortifications were extended northwards in 1757 in order to enclose the Weevil brewery (which had been acquired by the Victualling Commissioners a few years earlier). New defences were constructed for Gosport in 1778, with the bastioned Fort Monckton situated on the ground that had been occupied by Haselworth Castle in the Tudor era. Further renovations took place from 1797 to 1803, amid fears of French invasion. This created a line of bastions defending Gosport all the way from Blockhouse Point up to Forton Lake on the far side of the town, with French prisoners of war making up a part of the construction workforce. These developments rendered some of the older works redundant: both James Fort and Charles Fort were allowed to fall into ruin in the early 19th century. 
By 1805 Fort Blockhouse was armed with fifteen 36-pounder and fifteen 18-pounder guns. In 1813, as noted on a preserved datestone, the fort began to be remodelled: the west demi-bastion was extended to the north in 1817-20 and not long afterwards the sea battery was rebuilt with thirteen covered casemates housing 32-pounder guns. The upper part of the battery was strengthened and widened in 1845-48, providing space on the terreplein for a further thirteen guns to be mounted &quot;en barbette&quot;. This work was part of a substantial rebuilding, which saw the creation of the north bastion: a rounded structure with casemates, built of red brick and fronted in limestone, with upper and lower batteries which provided a field of fire over the harbour. It was linked, to the west bastion on the one hand and to the sea battery on the other, by a pair of long brick-built casemated buildings: the former providing accommodation for officers, the latter for other ranks.
The 18th-century fortifications of Gosport were considered obsolete by the 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom. While the commissioners did not recommend any changes to Fort Blockhouse, nor were its armaments updated: in 1867 it was still armed with 32-pounder smooth-bore cannons.

===Royal Engineer Submarine Mining Establishment (1873–1907)===
In 1873 Fort Blockhouse began to be used by the Royal Engineers as a base for the deployment of remote-controlled submarine mines as a line of defence for the harbour. At the edge of the headland, to the north of the fort, they built a short pier and several buildings over time, including a set of boathouses and cable sheds (which are still &quot;in situ&quot; as of 2024, alongside an associated slipway). The casemates of the north bastion were converted into stores for mine casings and other new buildings were erected around the site, along with a light rail system to move the mines and explosives. Additional administrative buildings were added in 1884, when the site also became home to the School of Submarine Miners. The pier was extended in 1888, and additional rooms continued to be added for storage and tests until 1891.

As a fort, Blockhouse was increasingly seen as obsolete and its armament was accordingly reduced, from ten RML 64-pounder guns in 1885 to three in 1888 (three machine guns were also provided, to protect the associated naval minefield). Subsequently five 12-pounder quick-firing guns were installed to combat the emerging threat posed by fast torpedo boats. In 1893-94 a defensive boom was provided, which could be deployed to seal off the harbour entrance (analogous to the old chain defence). 

In 1892 a new School of Submarine Mining was established on a site at Stokes Bay (close by Fort Gilkicker), which had previously been used for testing and experimental work. That same year the Royal Engineer companies moved from Fort Blockhouse to Fort Monckton; in their place a linked militia unit (the Portsmouth Militia Division (Submarine Miners) Royal Engineers), previously based at Fort Monckton, moved to Fort Blockhouse where they remained until 1907. The two forts were linked with a narrow gauge railway, which also extended to the facilities in Stokes Bay; the railway survived into the early 20th century.

===Royal Navy Submarine Base (1905-1998)===
The Royal Navy was not persuaded of the benefits of submarine mining and by 1903 the Admiralty was lobbying the War Office to take over submarine mining bases and to replace the fixed minefields with mobile submarines, in order to provide a more effective line of defence. Fort Blockhouse was duly turned over to the Royal Navy in 1905 to serve as a &#x27;Submarine Boat Station&#x27;: five Holland-class submarines were moved there, together with their depot ship HMS &quot;Hazard&quot;, and training was provided for submariner recruits in what would become the Royal Navy Submarine School. By 1909 a pier had been built along the north-west edge of the headland, creating an enclosed pool of water; further to the west a &#x27;petrol pier&#x27; was built for refuelling. A hulk, HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, was moored nearby to provide additional accommodation and from August 1912 the name HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; was extended to cover the whole establishment. From that year the Commodore Submarine Service was based there, as were his successors over the next 65 years. During the First World War HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; was the navy’s principal submarine depot. From 1917 periscope training took place there; this later developed into &#x27;Perisher&#x27;: the Submarine Command Course.
The period between the two world wars saw significant expansion at HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;: on the open courtyard within the bastions of the fort a number of administrative and other buildings were erected; upper floors were added to the casemated accommodation blocks, with the officers&#x27; block being extended to create a new officers&#x27; mess. The establishment also expanded beyond the lines of the original fort on Blockhouse point: west of the main gatehouse, the defensive moat was infilled in the 1920s and the earthworks were levelled; &#x27;Vulcan Block&#x27;, providing accommodation for seamen, was built there in 1933, along with a new guardhouse and various other buildings. East of the original fort, alongside the north bastion, a block for Warrant Officers was built facing the harbour; to the north-west, overlooking the piers, a headquarters block for the Rear Admiral was erected in 1937-38.
The prominent Submarine Escape Training Tower (SETT) was built in 1953, and opened in 1954. The need for such a training facility had been made apparent by the loss of &quot;HMS Truculent&quot; in 1950. Following the disbanding of the UK&#x27;s Coastal Artillery service, the battery of the fort was disarmed in 1956. At the same time, with the Submarine Service set to take on responsibility for the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent, HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; underwent a major expansion: a row of new large accommodation blocks was built alongside the recreation ground, to the west of the fort, looking out on the Solent. In the mid-1960s the training area around the SETT was rebuilt, with modern teaching blocks replacing the wooden huts formerly employed; facilities included practice torpedo tubes, sonar sets, fire-control, missile-launch and navigation systems. New buildings continued to be added through the 1970s, including additional accommodation and a new £2-million training facility (&#x27;Mackenzie Block&#x27;) for the Submarine School.

In 1980 a new Royal Navy Submarine Museum was established just outside the entrance to HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;.

The Submarine School continued to expand in the 1980s with the introduction of computer simulators, and an upper floor was added to the Mackenzie Building to accommodate weapons and systems training for the new &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class ballistic missile submarines. At the end of the decade the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines, based at HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; since the 1960s, were due to be decommissioned and by 1990 over £70-million had been spent on support facilities for their replacements, the &quot;Upholder&quot; class: a new generation of diesel-electric submarines. The end of the Cold War, however, brought with it a reduction in defence requirements, with the threat of Soviet submarines having passed, and in the end only four (out of a planned nine) replacement vessels were built. In 1992 it was announced that the new submarines would leave HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; and join the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class at HMNB Devonport; &quot;Dolphin&quot; would thus cease to be an operational submarine base (though it would continue to function as a training establishment). The last submarine left &quot;Dolphin&quot; in 1994. Having been declared surplus to requirements in 1996, HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; was formally decommissioned in 1998; the RN Submarine School (now under the aegis of HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot;) departed for Torpoint the following year. 

After the decommissioning, control of the fort&#x27;s jetties passed to the Queen&#x27;s Harbour Master (who managed them on behalf of the Naval Base commander).

====Coastal forces (1914-1966)====

During the First World War a base for coastal motor boats had been established on Haslar Creek, alongside Fort Blockhouse. It closed after the Armistice in 1918, but reopened in 1921; for a time it was placed under the command of HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, but in 1926 it was separately commissioned as . &quot;Hornet&quot; closed in 1936 and the site was leased to the Royal Air Force Marine Branch; but at the start of the Second World War it was recommissioned as HMS &quot;Hornet&quot; and served throughout the war as a Coastal Forces base. By 1943 forty-eight motor torpedo boats were stationed there, along with smaller numbers of motor launches and motor gunboats. After the war &quot;Hornet&quot; continued in commission until September 1957, when the Coastal Forces division was disbanded; however a small residual &#x27;Coastal Forces Trials and Special Service Squadron&#x27; was retained for a time, as part of HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, and provided with two new Brave-class patrol boats. The site then came to be known as &#x27;Dolphin 2&#x27;.

By 1964 the former &quot;Hornet&quot; site was largely disused. That year a sailing club (Hornet S.C.) was established there for serving and ex-Royal Navy personnel, with shore facilities, including a clubhouse in the former wardroom, and marina facilities on the creek. In 1972 the Royal Navy established a &#x27;joint services adventure sailing training centre&#x27; alongside the sailing club, which runs offshore sail training for serving members of the armed forces.

====SETT training facility (1998-2020)====

The Royal Navy Submarine School (RNSMS) remained at Fort Blockhouse until 23 December 1999, whereupon it moved to HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; in Cornwall. Nevertheless, the RNSMS still continued to make use of the Submarine Escape Training Tank (SETT) at Fort Blockhouse for a further twenty years: the SETT was used for pressurised training up until 2012, and then continued to be used for non-pressurised drills and teaching until it was finally decommissioned in January 2020. 

Subsequently a new submarine training facility was opened in HMNB Clyde.

=== Military hospital and medical training facilities (1996–2018)===
The proximity of Fort Blockhouse to the Royal Hospital Haslar led to a number of medical military units and facilities being established there, following the departure of the submarines, in the mid-1990s; this coincided with Haslar becoming Britain&#x27;s principal (and only) tri-service military hospital.

====33 Field Hospital====
In 1996, 33 Field Hospital (a 200-bed rapid-deployment containerised mobile hospital) relocated to Fort Blockhouse following the closure of Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot, where it had been established in 1985. Over the next twenty years the field hospital was regularly deployed, to Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, the last deployment being to South Sudan in 2017. 33 Field Hospital remained at Fort Blockhouse until 1 December 2018, when it was disbanded after 33 years’ existence.

====Defence Medical Training facilities====
Also in 1996 the Defence Medical Training Organisation (DMTO) was established at Fort Blockhouse, to assume responsibility for medical training across the three services and to rationalise its delivery. Subsequently, in 1996-97, the Royal Defence Medical College (RDMC) moved to Fort Blockhouse from Millbank: the RDMC provided initial and advanced training for all military Medical Officers and nurses and the majority of medical technicians. Following the decommissioning of HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; in 1998, RDMC became responsible for the whole Fort Blockhouse estate. In 2002, however, after the closure of Haslar hospital had been announced, the college relocated from Gosport to Birmingham (where the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine had been established the previous year); it now forms part of the University of Birmingham Medical School. 

After the closure of the college, the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency (successor to the DMTO) remained, with its headquarters in the Mackenzie Building at Fort Blockhouse; the DMETA maintained a &#x27;small residual training facility&#x27; on the site, which was connected with the local Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit. The DMETA was wound up in 2008, and its functions relocated to DMS Whittington as part of Joint Medical Command.

===Saluting station===

Up until 2017 Fort Blockhouse was the Royal Navy&#x27;s main saluting station in Portsmouth. Four QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted on the south casemates, the earliest dating from 1886, were regularly used for ceremonial gun salutes; they were the oldest firing guns in the Royal Navy. Latterly HMS &quot;Collingwood&quot; provided the gun crews; previously they had been manned by staff from HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;.

The use of Fort Blockhouse for gun salutes was of long standing; at the Portsmouth Naval Review of 1773 King George III was greeted by 21-gun salutes from Fort Blockhouse, the saluting platform and Southsea Castle. On an earlier occasion, when Charles II was sailing into Portsmouth to inspect the newly-finished fortifications in 1683, a gunner at Fort Blockhouse was killed when one of the guns burst as the salute was being fired.

===Coastwatch station===

Since 2008 the National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) has maintained a daily lookout from the fort&#x27;s signal tower; it was visited by the Princess Royal in 2023. Previously, following the decommissioning of HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, the signal tower had been used by the Queen&#x27;s Harbour Master as a Port Entry Control centre. 

== Future ==

In the early 2020s Ministry of Defence (MOD) still owned three parcels of land on the Haslar Peninsula, which it termed Fort Blockhouse 1, Fort Blockhouse 2 and Fort Blockhouse 3: Blockhouse 1 is the fort itself and adjacent land to the south-west (including the SETT and recreation ground), Blockhouse 2 is the former HMS &quot;Hornet&quot; site and Blockhouse 3 is land north of Haslar Road (which had been annexed to HMS &quot;Hornet&quot;, having previously formed part of Haslar Gunboat Yard). As of 2022, according to the MOD, a number of &#x27;non-military agencies, cadet forces and civilian associations&#x27; were still based at Fort Blockhouse, including: the Royal Naval Sailing Association (based at Blockhouse since the 1930s), Hornet Services Sailing Club, the Joint Services Adventurous Sail Training Centre, the Royal Navy Submarine Museum and local Sea Cadets and Air Training Corps units.

In 2015 Hornet Services Sailing Club signed a new lease on land and property at Fort Blockhouse 2 and 3, safeguarding its continued occupation of the site until at least 2065. Gosport Sea Cadets moved into new premises at Fort Blockhouse 3 in 2020, having signed a 25-year lease. In 2022 command of the Joint Services Adventurous Sail Training Centre, &#x27;one of the largest providers of sail training in the world&#x27;, was transferred from the Royal Navy to the Army, with a view to it continuing to provide offshore sailing experience from its base at Fort Blockhouse 2.

===Planned disposal===

In 2016, it was announced that Fort Blockhouse would be disposed of by the Ministry of Defence in 2020, as part of a wider package of reductions in defence estate. Surveys were undertaken from January to March 2020 to determine which structures at the site would become listed buildings, and major job cuts took place at the end of the year. The disposal date was later extended to at least 2023, and once more to 2025.

<text>The Transantarctic Mountains (abbreviated TAM) comprise a mountain range of uplifted rock (primarily sedimentary) in Antarctica which extends, with some interruptions, across the continent from Cape Adare in northern Victoria Land to Coats Land. These mountains divide East Antarctica and West Antarctica. They include a number of separately named mountain groups, which are often again subdivided into smaller ranges.

The range was first sighted by James Clark Ross in 1841 at what was later named the Ross Ice Shelf in his honour. It was first crossed during the British National Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1904.

==Geography==
The mountain range stretches between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea, the entire width of Antarctica, hence the name. With a total length of about , the Transantarctic Mountains are one of the longest mountain ranges on Earth. The Antarctandes are even longer, having in common with the Transantarctic Mountains the ranges from Cape Adare to the Queen Maud Mountains, but extending thence through the Whitmore Mountains and Ellsworth Mountains up the Antarctic Peninsula. The wide range forms the boundary between East Antarctica and West Antarctica. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet bounds the TAM along their entire length on the Eastern Hemisphere side, while the Western Hemisphere side of the range is bounded by the Ross Sea in Victoria Land from Cape Adare to McMurdo Sound, the Ross Ice Shelf from McMurdo Sound to near the Scott Glacier, and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet beyond.

The large summits and dry valleys of the TAM are some of the few places in Antarctica not covered by ice, the highest of which rise more than above sea level. The McMurdo Dry Valleys lie near McMurdo Sound and represent a special Antarctic phenomenon: landscapes that are snow and ice-free due to the extremely limited precipitation and ablation of ice in the valleys. The highest mountain of the TAM is the high Mount Kirkpatrick in the Queen Alexandra Range.

==Biology==
Penguins, seals, and sea birds live along the Ross Sea coastline in Victoria Land, while life in the interior of the Transantarctic Range is limited to bacteria, lichens, algae, and fungi. Forests once covered Antarctica, including plentiful Wollemi pines and southern beeches. However, with the gradual cooling associated with the break-up of Gondwana, these forests gradually disappeared. It is believed that the last trees on the Antarctic continent were on Transantarctic Mountains.

==History==
The Transantarctic Mountains were first seen by Captain James Clark Ross in 1841 from the Ross Sea. The range is a natural barrier that must be crossed to reach the South Pole from the Ross Ice Shelf.

The first crossing of the Transantarctic Mountains took place during the 1902–1904 British National Antarctic Expedition at the Ross Ice Shelf. A reconnaissance party under the command of Albert Armitage reached altitude in 1902. The following year, a party under expedition leader Robert Falcon Scott crossed into East Antarctica at a location now known as Ferrar Glacier, named after the geologist of the expedition. They explored part of Victoria Land on the Antarctic Plateau before returning via the same glacier.
In 1908, Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s party crossed the mountains through the Beardmore Glacier. Scott returned to that same glacier in 1911, while Roald Amundsen crossed the range via the Axel Heiberg Glacier.

Much of the range remained unexplored until the late 1940s and 1950s, when missions such as Operation Highjump and the International Geophysical Year (IGY) made extensive use of aerial photography and concentrated on a thorough investigation of the entire continent. The name &quot;Transantarctic Mountains&quot; was first applied to this range in a 1960 paper by geologist Warren B. Hamilton, following his IGY fieldwork. It was subsequently recommended by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names, a US authority on geographic names, in 1962. This purely descriptive label (in contrast to many other geographic names on Antarctica) is internationally accepted at present.

The Leverett Glacier in the Queen Maud Mountains is the planned route through the TAM for the overland supply road between McMurdo Station and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station.

==Geology==


The Transantarctic Mountains are considerably older than other mountain ranges of the continent, which are mainly volcanic in origin. The range was uplifted during the opening of the West Antarctic Rift System to the east, beginning about 65 million years ago in the early Cenozoic, and soon after became occupied by glaciers.

The mountains consist of sedimentary layers lying upon a basement of granites and gneisses. The sedimentary layers include the Beacon Supergroup sandstones, siltstones, and coal deposited beginning in the Silurian period and continuing into the Jurassic. In many places, the Beacon Supergroup has been intruded by dikes and sills of Jurassic age Ferrar Dolerite. Many of the fossils found in Antarctica are from locations within these sedimentary formations.

Ice from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet flows through the Transantarctic Mountains via a series of outlet glaciers into the Ross Sea, Ross Ice Shelf, and West Antarctic Ice Sheet. These glaciers generally flow perpendicular to the orientation of the range and define subranges and peak groups. It has been thought that many of these outlet glaciers follow the traces of large-scale geologic faults. However, the ice flow theories will be re-evaluated in light of new data from recent ice-penetrating radar surveys which revealed the presence of three previously unknown deep subglacial valleys affecting the &quot;mountainous subglacial topography beneath the ice divide&quot;. These geographic features are likely to have a significant impact on models and calculations related to ice flow through the Transantarctic Mountain region.

He is a regular contributor to science fiction webzines, such as &quot;The Drink Tank&quot;, and in 2009 announced his ultimately unsuccessful candidacy for 2010&#x27;s TransAtlantic Fan Fund.

Wu is also a filmmaker, having released in 2006 the animated short &quot;The Tragical Historie of Guidolon the Giant Space Chicken&quot;. A director&#x27;s cut of this short was released in 2007, and a full-length version was in production as of 2008.

In addition to these activities, Wu holds a PhD in bacterial genetics from University of Wisconsin–Madison, though his day job is in patent law for a pharmaceutical conglomerate. He is also a member of BASFA, the Bay Area Science Fiction Association.

He provided designs for the spaceships as well as the space station N313 for the videogame &quot;Revolution 60&quot;.

<text>The Noatak River () (also Noatok, Noatuk, Nunatok, or Notoark) is a river in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Alaska.

==Description==
The Noatak River&#x27;s headwaters are on the north flank of Mount Igikpak in the Schwatka Mountains of the Brooks Range in the Gates of the Arctic National Park. The Noatak flows generally westward for about to the Chukchi Sea at Kotzebue Sound.

The river&#x27;s entire course is north of the Arctic Circle. Leaving Gates of the Arctic National Park the river enters the Noatak National Preserve which exactly delineates the river&#x27;s watershed. The entire watershed of the Noatak River lies within these two protected areas, from the headwaters to where it leaves the Noatak National Preserve, which is a point approximately 20 river miles upstream of Noatak village and 90 river miles upstream of the river&#x27;s delta in Kotzebue Sound. Even on this last part of the river most of the watershed lies within either Noatak National Preserve or Cape Krusenstern National Monument, with only the immediate river valley outside of these protected areas. The Noatak basin is the largest undisturbed watershed in the United States. The Noatak National Preserve alone encompasses .

There are small inholdings of private land within the National Preserve, some of these have private cabins.
The only permanent settlement along the Noatak River is the village of Noatak. The village has a lighted public gravel airstrip, several small stores, post office, and a school.
The Noatak is fed by a relatively large watershed: as for some other large braided Arctic rivercourses, rare severe rain events can result in temporary rapid inundation, to a depth of several feet, of normally dry river bars. There are a few small remnant glaciers in the Schwatka Mountains, their contribution to the water budget of the Noatak is negligible.

==Name origin==
Named &quot;Inland River&quot; by surgeon John Simpson of the Royal Navy on a map he prepared in 1853, his wording appears to be a general translation of the Inuit name &quot;Nunulak&quot;, according to the United States Geological Survey. The name &quot;Nunatak&quot; could also mean &quot;new land&quot; or &quot;belong to the land.&quot;

==&quot;Wild and Scenic&quot; designation==
On December 2, 1980, the of the Noatak—from its source in Gates of the Arctic National Park to the Kelly River in the Noatak National Preserve—became part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

<text>The Rolls-Royce RB.53 Dart is a turboprop engine designed and manufactured by Rolls-Royce Limited. First run in 1946, it powered the Vickers Viscount on its maiden flight in 1948. A flight on July 29 of that year, which carried 14 paying passengers between Northolt and Paris–Le Bourget Airport in a Dart-powered Viscount, was the first regularly scheduled airline flight by a turbine-powered aircraft. The Viscount was the first turboprop-powered aircraft to enter airline service - British European Airways (BEA) in 1953.

The Dart was still in production forty years later when the last Fokker F27 Friendships and Hawker Siddeley HS 748s were produced in 1987.

Following the company&#x27;s convention for naming gas turbine engines after rivers, this turboprop engine design was named after the River Dart.

==History==
Designed in 1946 by a team led by Lionel Haworth, the Dart engine was derived using experience gained from the earlier more powerful Rolls-Royce Clyde turboprop. A two-stage centrifugal compressor was specified to achieve the desired overall pressure ratio. A 3 stage, shared load, axial turbine was used to drive both the load (via a reduction gearbox) and the compression system. A photo showing a cutaway section of typical Dart engine is given below. 

Unlike the Clyde, the engine lacked a free power turbine. Consequently, under normal operating conditions, the power delivered to the propeller could not be modulated at a fixed prop speed.

The Dart was initially rated at 890 shp and first flew in October 1947 mounted to the nose of a converted Avro Lancaster. 

Improvements in the design boosted power output to 1,400 shp in the RDa.3, which went into production for the Viscount in 1952. The RDa.6 increased power to 1,600 shp and the RDa.7 to 1,800 shp by incorporating various improvements including a larger diameter second impeller.

Later Darts were rated up to 3,245 shp and remained in production until 1987, with approximately 7,100 produced, flying some 170 million hours.

The Dart was also produced under licence in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.

Haworth and his team later went on to design and develop the larger and more powerful Rolls-Royce Tyne.

==Variants==
As well as the RB.53 designation each mark of Dart engine was allocated a Ministry of Supply (MoS) &quot;RDa.n&quot; number as well as Mk.numbers.

==Applications==
Largely associated with the very successful Vickers Viscount medium-range airliner, it powered a number of other European and Japanese designs of the 1950s and 60s and was also used to convert American-manufactured piston aircraft to turboprop power. The list includes:
* Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy : Medium-range transport
* Aviation Traders Accountant : Cancelled prototype airliner
* Avro 748 (Hawker Siddeley H.S. 748) : Feeder airliner.
* Avro Athena one prototype aircraft only : Military trainer 
* Breguet Alizé : Anti-submarine aircraft: Dart RDa 21 2099 hp with water/methanol injection
* Cavalier Turbo Mustang III
* Fairchild F-27 : Small airliner, U.S. manufactured version of the Fokker F27 Friendship. Two versions: F27A and F27B
* Fairchild Hiller FH-227 : Airliner, U.S. manufactured version of the Fairchild F-27 featuring a stretched fuselage with increased passenger seating
* Fokker F27 Friendship : Small airliner from Dutch aerospace and aviation manufacturer Fokker. The original model on which several other airliners were based (such as the abovementioned F-27 and FH-227).
* Grumman Gulfstream I (G-159) : Executive transport &amp; small airliner. Includes the stretched Grumman Gulfstream I-C (G-159C).
* Handley Page Dart Herald : Small airliner
* Hawker Siddeley Andover : Military transport
* NAMC YS-11 : Short/medium range airliner (Japanese aircraft)
* Some Douglas DC-3 transport aircraft have been upgraded to use Darts. DC-3s in BEA service with this update were called Pionairs. Another conversion is the Conroy Turbo Three.
* Convair 600 and Convair 640 converted from Convair 240, Convair 340 and Convair 440 piston-powered aircraft: Small airliners
* Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress : A unique one was converted by Aero-Flite Company with 4x Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines and was used for fire fighting.

Power output was around 1,500 hp (1,120 kW) in early versions, and close to twice that in later versions, such as those that powered the NAMC YS-11 airliner. Some versions of the engine were fitted with water methanol injection, which boosted power in hot and high altitude conditions.

<doc id="971917" wikidata="Q786307" url="?curid=971917" title="Irenaios of Jerusalem">
<text>Emmanouil Skopelitis (; 17 April 1939 – 10 January 2023) was, under the name Irenaios (), the 140th patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, from his election in 2001, when he succeeded Patriarch Diodoros, until his dismissal in 2005, when he was succeeded by Patriarch Theophilos III.

==Biography==
Irenaios was born on 17 April 1939 on the Greek island of Samos as Emmanouil Skopelitis. He moved to Jerusalem in 1953.

Irenaios served for many years as Exarch of the Holy Sepulchre in Athens.

Upon the death of Patriarch Diodoros, Skopelitis was appointed &quot;locum tenens&quot; (temporary head of the Greek Orthodox Church in Jerusalem) in 2000, and was elected patriarch on 13 August 2001, in the traditional election held at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. He was enthroned on 15 September 2001 as &quot;Patriarch of the Holy City of Jerusalem and all Palestine, Syria, beyond the Jordan River, Cana of Galilee and Holy Zion&quot; in the presence of senior church and secular dignitaries, including Archbishop Christodoulos of the Church of Greece and Metropolitan Nicholas of the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church.

==Dismissal and replacement==
In early 2005, almost four years into his term as patriarch, Irenaios was accused of selling three properties of the Greek Church in the Old City of Jerusalem to Ateret Cohanim, a Jewish organization whose declared aim is that of establishing a Jewish majority in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City and in Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.

As most of the Orthodox Christians in the area are Palestinian, and the land was in an Arab-populated area that most Palestinians hoped would become a part of a future Palestinian capital, these accusations caused a great deal of concern among Church members. 

On 6 May 2005, with a voting that required a two-thirds majority, the Holy Synod of Jerusalem (the ruling body of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem) deposed Irenaios as patriarch. Irenaios, nevertheless, refused to accept his deposition.

On 24 May 2005, a special pan-Orthodox Synod was convened in Constantinople (Istanbul), under the presidency of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, &quot;primus inter pares&quot; of the Eastern Orthodox Church, to review the decisions of the Holy Synod of Jerusalem. The pan-Orthodox Synod voted overwhelmingly to confirm the decision of the Holy Synod of Jerusalem and to strike Irenaios&#x27;s name from the diptychs.

The Synod elected Theophilos III as the new Patriarch of Jerusalem on 22 August 2005. The election was confirmed by the pan-Orthodox Synod of Constantinople, and Patriarch Theophilos III was enthroned on 22 November 2005. 

By a longstanding tradition, the dismissal of a patriarch of Jerusalem and the election of a replacement in theory required the recognition of the governments in the regions of the patriarchate&#x27;s authority – Israel, the State of Palestine and Jordan. The Jordanian king and the Palestinian Authority immediately recognized Irenaios&#x27;s dismissal, while Israel continued to recognize Irenaios as the Orthodox patriarch for over two years, and continued to invite him to official government functions. In December 2007, Israel finally joined the Jordanian and Palestinian governments in recognising Theophilos III as the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem.

Upon assuming office, Patriarch Theophilos III immediately initiated legal procedures in Israeli courts to cancel the sales of the buildings, claiming that the sales had not been approved by the Synod (the ruling body of the Greek Church), and that the finance director responsible for the sale, Nikolas Papadimos, had received money from Ateret Cohanim to advance the deal and had committed acts of theft and corruption involving funds of the Patriarchate. It was also argued that the price paid for the buildings by Ateret Cohanim was significantly lower than their market value. Still, in June 2022, Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court ruled that Ateret Cohanim had purchased the properties legally, and that the three properties in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City now legally belong to the Jewish organization.

== Post dismissal ==
After his dismissal, Irenaios took up residence in a small apartment on the top floor of the building of the Greek Patriarchate of Jerusalem. From February 2008 until 2015, Irenaios did not leave this apartment, receiving food from his supporters via a basket tied to a rope lowered down from his apartment to the surrounding streets, and claiming he was imprisoned there by Theophilos III, while the Greek Patriarchate claimed that Irenaios had voluntarily imprisoned himself, and was free to leave his apartment, but preferred to remain locked up inside in protest for not accepting his legal deposition. In 2011, Irenaios confirmed in an interview given to Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; that he was not prevented from leaving the building, but didn&#x27;t do so out of fear he might not be able to return.

Suffering from pulmonary disease, Irenaios left the building in November 2015 for surgery. Patriarch Theophilos III went to the hospital to visit Irenaios, who returned to his apartment in the Greek Patriarchate after recovering. In what was interpreted as a possible sign of reconciliation, Irenaios voluntarily left his apartment again in March 2016 to attend a reception in honor of Patriarch Theophilos III.

However, in 2019 Irenaios sent a letter to the Consulate of Greece in Jerusalem, in which he claimed he continued to live in a state of &quot;de facto&quot; imprisonment, asserting that his Greek passport had been stolen from him, and that Patriarch Theophilos III was attempting to have him transferred to a monastery near Jericho, against his will. Irenaios was granted assistance from the Greek government, and, in August 2019, he arrived in a wheelchair at Ben Gurion International Airport and boarded a flight to Athens.

== Death ==
Irenaios died after a long illness in Athens, on January 10, 2023, at the age of 83. He was buried in his birthplace of Samos as Patriarch Theophilos III refused to allow Irenaios to be buried in Jerusalem.

<text>A contrast effect is the enhancement or diminishment, relative to normal, of perception, cognition or related performance as a result of successive (immediately previous) or simultaneous exposure to a stimulus of lesser or greater value in the same dimension. (Here, normal perception, cognition or performance is that which would be obtained in the absence of the comparison stimulus—i.e., one based on all previous experience.)

Perception example: A neutral gray target will appear lighter or darker than it does in isolation when immediately preceded by, or simultaneously compared to, respectively, a dark gray or light gray target.

Cognition example: A person will appear more or less attractive than that person does in isolation when immediately preceded by, or simultaneously compared to, respectively, a less or more attractive person.

Performance example: A laboratory rat will work faster, or slower, during a stimulus predicting a given amount of reward when that stimulus and reward are immediately preceded by, or alternated with, respectively, different stimuli associated with either a lesser or greater amount of reward.

==Types==
=== Simultaneous contrast ===
The oldest reference to simultaneous contrast in the scientific literature is by the hand of the 11th century physicist Ibn al-Haytham who describes spots of paint on a white background appearing almost black and conversely paler than their true colour on black:
He also describes that a leaf green paint may appear clearer and younger on dark blue and darker and older on yellow:
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe writes in 1810 that a grey image on a black background appears much brighter than the same on white. And Johannes Peter Müller notes the same in 1838 and also that a strip of grey on a brightly coloured field appears to be tinted ever so slightly in the contrasting colour.

The subject of the impact of the surrounding field on colour perception has been a subject of ongoing research since. It has been found that the size of the surrounding field has an impact, as does the separation between colour and surround, similarity of chromaticity, luminance difference and the structure of the surround.

There has been some debate over the degree to which simultaneous contrast is a physiological process caused by the connections of neurons in the visual cortex, or whether it is a psychological effect. Both appear to have some effect. A possible source of the effect are neurons in the V4 area that have inhibitory connections to neighboring cells. The most likely evolutionary rationale for this effect is that it enhances edges in the visual field, thus facilitating the recognition of shapes and objects.
=== Successive contrast ===
Successive contrast occurs when the perception of currently viewed stimuli is modulated by previously viewed stimuli. In the example below you can use the scrollbar to quickly swap the red and green disks for two orange disks. Staring at the dot in the centre of one of the top two coloured disks and then looking at the dot in the centre of the corresponding lower disk makes the two lower disks briefly appear to have different colours, though in reality their colour is identical.

=== Metacontrast and paracontrast ===
Metacontrast and paracontrast involve both time and space. When one half of a circle is lit for 10 milliseconds (ms), it is at its maximal intensity. If the other half is displayed at the same time (but 20–50 ms later), there is a mutual inhibition: the left side is darkened by the right half (&quot;metacontrast&quot;), and the center may be completely obliterated. At the same time, there is a slight darkening of the right side due to the first stimulus (&quot;paracontrast&quot;).

==Domains==
The contrast effect was noted by the 17th century philosopher John Locke, who observed that lukewarm water can feel like hair or feel cold depending on whether the hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water. 

In the early 20th century, Wilhelm Wundt identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception, and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas. Contrast effects can shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness, but other kinds of perception, including the perception of weight. Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was unpleasant or pleasant. For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to be similar to each other: a television reporter can seem to shrink when interviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tall building. Furthermore, the contrast effect has been argued to apply to foreign policies of states. For example, African countries have increasingly looked to China and India as opposed to the US, the EU and the World Bank because these Asian states have highlighted their lack of &quot;interference&quot; and &quot;conditionality&quot; in exchange for foreign aid and FDI.

<doc id="971942" wikidata="Q662726" url="?curid=971942" title="Noatak National Preserve">
<text>Noatak National Preserve is a United States National Preserve in northwestern Alaska that was established to protect the Noatak River Basin. The Noatak River system, located just north of the Arctic Circle, is thought to be the last remaining complete river system in the United States that has not been altered by human activities. The roadless basin was proclaimed a United States National Monument in 1978 and a National Preserve in 1980 through the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). Noatak National Preserve borders Kobuk Valley National Park on the south and Gates of the Arctic National Park on the east. Unlike the national parks that it borders, sport hunting is allowed in Noatak National Preserve.

All of the preserve, except for about east of the village of Noatak, has been designated the Noatak Wilderness. The wilderness is the fourth-largest in the United States, following the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness, the Mollie Beattie Wilderness, and the Gates of the Arctic Wilderness.

==Ecology and geology==
The preserve includes the transition zone from boreal forest to tundra near the southern edge of the preserve. The Noatak Basin is a transition zone for plants and animals between Arctic and subarctic environments. The lower portion of the Noatak valley has areas of boreal forest, but most vegetation is low-growing tundra species. Alpine tundra occurs at high elevation, and moist tundra, the most common condition, supports cottongrass, willows, Labrador tea, mountain alder, dwarf birch and other tundra species at lower elevations. Boggy areas support cranberry, bog rosemary and salmonberry.

Wildlife of the Noatak tundra includes Alaskan moose, grizzly bears, black bears, wolf packs, Arctic foxes, lemmings, Dall&#x27;s sheep, vast herds of caribou numbering more than 230,000 individuals, and a variety of birds. Larger birds include Canada geese, tundra swans, white-fronted geese and common, Arctic, yellow-billed and Pacific loons. Predatory birds include rough-legged hawks, gyrfalcons and golden eagles.

The central feature of the preserve is the Noatak River, and is a breeding ground for a variety of commercially important fish. The most widespread salmon species is chum, and pink, chinook and sockeye salmon are found as well. Several kinds of trout are found in deep lakes, with Arctic char and Arctic grayling the most common salmonids in the preserve. Burbot are also found, as are nelma or sheefish, an important species for subsistence fisheries.

The Brooks Range has existed since Cretaceous time, and is composed mainly of shales, limestone and chert, with intrusions of igneous rocks from more recent volcanism. The valleys are composed of limestone, sandstone and siltstone, with deposits of sand, gravel, silt and clay. During the Wisconsonian glaciation the area was incompletely covered by ice, with higher regions glaciated. Permafrost exists in higher regions, becoming patchy at lower levels.

==Activities==
Since Noatak is a national preserve, both subsistence hunting by local residents and sport hunting by outsiders are permitted in the preserve. If Noatak was a national park, only subsistence hunting would be allowed. Float trips on the Noatak River are a popular way to see the preserve. However, most trips on the Noatak River take place high on the river in Gates of the Arctic National Park, typically from Twelve Mile Creek to Lake Matcherak. Longer trips can continue through the preserve, although the lower river&#x27;s braided stream presents difficulties beyond Noatak village. There are a few rapids on the river of Class II+, although most of the river is Class I or Class II. Float trip season runs from June or July, when the river thaws, to September. Biting insects are most prevalent in June and July.

==Geography==
The preserve extends westward from Gates of the Arctic National Park along the Brooks Range to the north and the Baird Mountains to the south, enclosing the valley of the Noatak River. It is bordered to the north by the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska. The lower valley of the Noatak is not part of the preserve, separating the preserve from Cape Krusenstern National Monument on the coast. The southeast corner of the preserve runs almost to the coastline at Hotham Inlet. The distance from the headwaters in Gates of the Arctic National Park to Noatak, Alaska is about . Land ownership within the preserve is mostly federal, with owned by native corporations or under easements.

The entire preserve is above the Arctic Circle. Summer weather can have high temperatures of , although snow can occur at any time. The climate is more maritime and temperate on the western side of the park, with harsher, more extreme conditions in the east.

==History==

===Human occupation===
Archaeological investigations of the Noatak Valley have found artifacts at sites mostly outside of the preserve. Relatively little has been found within the preserve boundaries. A site just outside the preserve has been dated to 11,700 years before present. Discoveries at Bering Land Bridge National Preserve imply human occupation as far back as 13,000 years ago. Similar extrapolation from sites at Cape Krusenstern and at Onion Portage in the Kobuk Valley imply occupation in later times. In historical times the Naupaktomiut portion of the Inupiat people lived in the lower Noatak valley and the Noatagmuit occupied the middle and upper valley. Hunters from the area of Kotzebue and the Kobuk valley visited the Noatak valley as well. Archaeological remains indicate the presence of villages at lake shores in the preserve during the 1600s, which are believed to have been disrupted by disease-induced population decline brought about by contact with Europeans. The lower Noatak was first explored in 1850 by men from the British survey ship HMS &quot;Plover&quot;. More surveys took place in 1885. Prospectors arrived in 1898 as a consequence of the Klondike gold rush. In the early 1900s nearly all of the remaining people in the valley concentrated at Noatak.

===Administration and designations===
Noatak National Monument was proclaimed on December 1, 1978 by President Jimmy Carter using his authority under the Antiquities Act. Carter took the action after the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was held up in Congress. In 1980 ANILCA was passed, and was signed into law by Carter on December 2, 1980, converting the monument into a national preserve. No roads enter the preserve. Access is solely by air, boat or walking.

The preserve&#x27;s headquarters are at the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center in Kotzebue to the west of the park on the Bering Sea coast. Offices and visitor services for Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Kobuk Valley National Park are in the same facility. The units are managed together as the Western Arctic National Parklands, with a single Park Service superintendent in charge.

A portion of the Noatak valley was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1976, prior to the preserve&#x27;s establishment, and was withdrawn from the program in June 2017. of the Noatak, from its source in Gates of the Arctic National Park to the Kelly River in the Noatak National Preserve, were designated a National Wild and Scenic River as part of the ANILCA legislation.

<text>Lean into It is the second studio album by the American rock band Mr. Big, released on March 26, 1991. The band&#x27;s breakthrough release, &quot;Lean into It&quot; peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, while the single &quot;To Be with You&quot; became the band&#x27;s first and only song to hit number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The follow-up single, &quot;Just Take My Heart&quot;, was a top-20 hit, peaking at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100.

&quot;Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy&quot; features Gilbert and Sheehan running Makita cordless drills over their guitar strings in harmony to create an unusually fast solo which is likely not possible to replicate with hands. The &quot;CDFF&quot; prefix of the Jeff Paris-penned &quot;Lucky This Time&quot;, is the song &quot;Addicted to That Rush&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1989 eponymous debut album, played at a higher playback speed; hence the &quot;CDFF&quot; for &quot;Compact Disc Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;CDFF&quot; is also the chord structure to the song.

The cover image is a picture from the Montparnasse train accident that occurred on October 22, 1895, in Gare Montparnasse station in Paris.

The album was ranked No. 49 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 50 Greatest Hair Metal Albums of All Time.

The album includes the song &quot;Green-Tinted Sixties Mind&quot;.

<text>George Joseph Smith (11 January 1872 – 13 August 1915) was an English serial killer and bigamist who was convicted and subsequently hanged for the murders of three women in 1915. The case became known as the Brides in the Bath Murders. As well as being widely reported in the media, it was significant in the history of forensic pathology and detection. It was also one of the first cases in which striking similarities between connected crimes were used to prove guilt, a technique used in subsequent prosecutions.

== Early life and marriages ==
George Joseph Smith was born in Bethnal Green, London, on 11 January 1872, the son of an insurance agent. At age 9, Smith was sent to a reformatory at Gravesend, Kent, and later was imprisoned for fraud and theft. In 1896 he was sentenced to 12 months&#x27; imprisonment for persuading a woman to steal from her employers. Smith used the proceeds to open a baker&#x27;s shop in Leicester.

In 1898, under the alias George Oliver Love, Smith married Caroline Beatrice Thornhill in Leicester; it was his only legal marriage. They moved to London, where she worked as a maid for a number of employers, stealing from them for her husband. Thornhill was eventually caught in Worthing, Sussex, and sentenced to 12 months. On her release, she incriminated her husband and he was imprisoned in January 1901 for two years. On his release, Thornhill fled to Canada. Smith then went back to his other wife, cleared out her savings and left.

In June 1908, Smith married Florence Wilson, a widow from Worthing. On 3 July he left her, but not before taking £30 () drawn from her savings account and selling her belongings from their Camden Town residence in London. On 30 July in Bristol, Smith married Edith Peglar, who had replied to an advertisement for a housekeeper. Smith would disappear for months at a time, saying that he was going to another city to sell antiques. Between his other marriages, Smith would always come back to Peglar with money.

In October 1909, Smith married Sarah Freeman, under the name George Rose Smith. As with Wilson, he left Freeman after clearing out her savings and selling her war bonds, with a total take of £400. He then married Bessie Mundy and Alice Burnham. In September 1914, he married Alice Reid under the alias Charles Oliver James. In total, Smith entered into seven bigamous marriages between 1908 and 1914. In most of these cases, Smith stole and dissipated his wives&#x27; possessions before he disappeared.

== Two similar deaths ==
In January 1915, Divisional Detective Inspector Arthur Neil of the Metropolitan Police received a letter from Joseph Crossley, who owned a boarding house in Blackpool, Lancashire. Included with the letter were two newspaper clippings: one was from the &quot;News of the World&quot; dated before Christmas 1914, about the death of Margaret Elizabeth Lloyd (&quot;née&quot; Lofty), aged 38, who died in her lodgings in 14 Bismarck Road, Highgate (later renamed Waterlow Road). She was found in her bathtub by her husband, John Lloyd, and their landlady.

The other clipping contained the report of a Blackpool coroner&#x27;s inquest, dated 13 December 1913, concerning a woman named Alice Smith (&quot;née&quot; Burnham) who had died suddenly in a boarding house while in her bathtub. She was found by her husband, George Smith. Alice was not an heiress but had worked hard and saved money. Additionally, Smith took out a life insurance policy on his wife worth £500 ().

The letter, dated 3 January, was written by Crossley on behalf of his wife and Mr Charles Burnham, who both expressed their suspicion on the striking similarity of the two incidents and urged the police to investigate the matter.

== The hunt ==
Neil visited 14 Bismarck Road, where the Lloyds had taken lodgings, and found it hard to believe that an adult like Mrs Lloyd could have drowned in such a small tub, especially since the tub was three-quarters full when she was found. He then interviewed the coroner, Dr Bates, and asked whether there were signs of violence on the woman; none were seen except for a tiny bruise above the left elbow. Upon further investigation, Neil learned that a will had been made on 18 December 1914, three hours before Mrs Lloyd died, which made her husband John the sole beneficiary; John had submitted the new will to a lawyer &quot;for settlement&quot;. In addition, Mrs Lloyd had withdrawn all her savings on that same day.

On 12 January, Dr Bates called Neil with an enquiry from the Yorkshire Insurance Company regarding the death of Mrs Lloyd. Three days before she was married, she had taken out a life insurance policy for £700 (), with John as sole beneficiary. Neil promptly asked the doctor to delay his reply. At the same time, Neil requested more information on the Smith case from the Blackpool police. Similarly, the late Mrs Smith had earlier taken out a life insurance policy and made a will in her husband&#x27;s favour, and she took the lodgings in Blackpool only after Mr Smith inspected the bathtub.

Neil asked Dr Bates to issue a favourable report to the insurance company. He was counting on the suspect to get in touch with his lawyer, and the office was watched day and night. On 1 February, a man fitting Lloyd/Smith&#x27;s description appeared. Neil introduced himself and asked him whether he was John Lloyd. After Lloyd answered in the affirmative, Neil then asked him whether he was also George Smith. The man denied it vehemently. Neil, already sure that Lloyd and Smith were the same man, told him that he would take him for questioning on suspicion of bigamy. The man finally admitted that he was indeed Smith and was arrested.

== Spilsbury enters the case ==
When Smith was arrested for the charge of bigamy and suspicion of murder, the pathologist Bernard Spilsbury was asked to determine how the women died. Although he was the Home Office pathologist and acted mainly in a consulting capacity, Spilsbury was also available for direct assistance to the police force.

Margaret Lloyd&#x27;s body was exhumed, and Spilsbury&#x27;s first task was to confirm drowning as the cause of death; and if so, whether by accident or by force. He confirmed the tiny bruise on the elbow as noted before, as well as two microscopic marks. Even the evidence of drowning was not extensive. There were no signs of heart or circulatory disease, but the evidence suggested that death was almost instantaneous, as if the victim died of a sudden stroke. Poison was also seen as a possibility, and Spilsbury ordered tests on its presence. Finally, he proposed to Neil that they run some experiments in the very same bathtub in which Mrs Lloyd died. Neil had it set up in the police station.

Newspaper reports about the &quot;Brides in the Baths&quot; began to appear. On 8 February, the chief police officer of Herne Bay, a small seaside resort in Kent, had read the stories, and sent Neil a report of another death which was strikingly similar to the other two.

== A third victim ==
A year before Burnham&#x27;s death in Blackpool, one Henry Williams had rented a house with no bath in 80 High Street, for himself and his wife, Beatrice &quot;Bessie&quot; Mundy, whom he had married in Weymouth, Dorset in 1910. He then rented a bathtub seven weeks later. He took his wife to a local GP, Dr Frank French, owing to an epileptic seizure, although she was complaining only of headaches, for which the doctor prescribed some medication. On 12 July 1912, Williams woke French, saying that his wife was having another seizure. He checked on her, and promised to come back the following afternoon. However, he was surprised when, on the following morning, he was informed by Williams that his wife had died of drowning. The doctor found Bessie in the tub, her head under water, her legs stretched out straight and her feet protruding out of the water. There was no trace of violence, so French attributed the drowning to epilepsy. The inquest jury awarded Williams the amount of £2,579 13s 7d (£2,579.68p) (), as stipulated in Mrs Williams&#x27; will, made up five days before her death.

Neil then sent photographs of Smith to Herne Bay for possible identification, and then went to Blackpool, where Spilsbury was conducting an autopsy of Alice Smith. The results were the same as with Margaret Lloyd: the lack of violence, every suggestion of instantaneous death, and little evidence of drowning. Furthermore, there were no traces of poison on Margaret Lloyd. Baffled, Spilsbury routinely took measurements of the corpse and had the tub sent to London.

Back in London, Neil had received confirmation from Herne Bay. &quot;Henry Williams&quot; was also &quot;John Lloyd&quot; and &quot;George Smith&quot;. This time, when Spilsbury examined Bessie Williams, he found one sure sign of drowning: the presence of goose pimples on the skin on her thigh. As with the other two deaths, the tub in which Mrs Williams had died was sent to London.

== Solution ==
For weeks, Spilsbury pondered over the bathtubs and the victims&#x27; measurements. The first stage of an epileptic seizure consists of a stiffening and extension of the entire body. Considering Bessie Williams&#x27; height (5 feet 7 inches) and the length of the tub (5 feet), the upper part of her body would have been pushed up the sloping head of the tub, far above the level of the water. The second stage consists of violent spasms of the limbs, which were drawn up to the body and then flung outward. Therefore, no one of her size could possibly get under water, even when her muscles were relaxed: the tub was simply too small.

Using French&#x27;s description of Bessie Williams when he found her in the bathtub, Spilsbury reasoned that Smith must have seized her by the feet and suddenly pulled them up toward himself, sliding the upper part of the body under water. The sudden flood of water into her nose and throat might cause shock and sudden loss of consciousness, explaining the absence of injuries and minimal signs of drowning.

Neil hired several experienced female divers of the same size and build as the victims. He tried to push them under water by force but there would be inevitable signs of struggle. Neil then unexpectedly pulled the feet of one of the divers, and her head glided underwater before she knew what happened. Suddenly Neil saw that the woman was no longer moving. He quickly pulled her out of the tub and it took him and a doctor over half an hour to revive her. When she came to, she related that the only thing she remembered was the rush of water before she lost consciousness. Thus was Spilsbury&#x27;s theory confirmed.

George Joseph Smith was arrested on 15 February 1915 and formally charged on 23 March 1915 with the murders of Bessie Williams, Alice Smith, and Margaret Lloyd.

== Trial and legal legacy ==
On 22 June 1915 the trial began at the Old Bailey. The prosecuting counsel were Archibald Bodkin (later Director of Public Prosecutions), Cecil Whiteley (later KC) and Travers Humphreys (later Mr Justice Humphreys). Although in accordance with English law he could be tried only for the murder of Bessie Mundy, the prosecution used the deaths of the other two to establish the pattern of Smith&#x27;s crimes; this was allowed by Mr Justice Scrutton despite the protests of Smith&#x27;s counsel, Sir Edward Marshall Hall. Smith elected not to give evidence in his own defence, indicating this to Marshall Hall in a handwritten note (pictured).
It took the jury about 20 minutes on 1 July to find him guilty; he was then sentenced to death. Marshall Hall appealed on the grounds that the evidence of &quot;system&quot; has been improperly admitted, but Lord Reading LCJ dismissed the appeal, and Smith was hanged in Maidstone Prison on 13 August 1915 by the hangman John Ellis.

The use of &#x27;system&#x27; – comparing other crimes to the one a criminal is being tried for to prove guilt – set a precedent that was later used in other murder trials. For example, the doctor and suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams was charged for the murder of Edith Alice Morrell, but the deaths of Gertrude Hullett and her husband Jack were used in the committal hearing to prove the existence of a pattern. This use of &#x27;system&#x27; was later criticised by the trial judge when Adams was tried only on the Morrell charge.

== Popular culture ==

In his book &quot;Why Britain is at War&quot;, Harold Nicolson used Smith&#x27;s repeatedly murderous behaviour as a parallel to Hitler&#x27;s repeatedly acquisitive behaviour in Europe in the 1930s.
In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s book &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot;, which is set during the Second World War, General Whale is referred to as &quot;Brides-in-the-bath&quot; because all the operations he sponsored seemed to require the extermination of all involved.

The Smith case is mentioned in Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; mysteries &quot;Whose Body?&quot;, &quot;Unnatural Death&quot; and &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;, as well as in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot; and &quot;The Murder on the Links&quot;. It is also mentioned in Ngaio Marsh&#x27;s &quot;Artists in Crime&quot; and in Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s novel &quot;A Suspension of Mercy&quot; on page 63: &quot;Not for him the Smith brides-in-a-bath murders for peanuts.&quot; The crimes of George Joseph Smith also feature in William Trevor&#x27;s novel &quot;The Children of Dynmouth&quot; in which the sociopathic protagonist plans to re-enact the crimes as part of the community&#x27;s Easter Fete. On page 273 of Monica Ferris&#x27;s novel &quot;The Drowning Spool&quot; it mentions &quot;a certain George Joseph Smith&quot; who is discovered through the work of &quot;a very clever forensic investigator back then&quot;. Margery Allingham&#x27;s short story &quot;Three Is a Lucky Number&quot; (1955) adapts the events and refers to James Joseph Smith and his brides. It is also mentioned in Gladys Mitchell’s novel “Brazen Tongue” (1940) in which the local detective Stallard claims to Mrs Bradley that “like George Joseph Smith, we’ve ’eclipsed the European war’” in the reporting of the series of murders that opens the book. The Smith case was dramatised in the radio series &quot;The Black Museum&quot; in 1952 under the title of &quot;The Bath Tub&quot;. Czechoslovak Television&#x27;s series &quot;Adventures of Criminology&quot; (1990), based on famous criminal cases in which new methods of investigation were used, depicts this case in the episode 7, &quot;Reconstruction&quot;. The protagonist of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s 1968 short story &quot;An American Organ&quot; wishes to emulate Smith by murdering his wife in a bath.

Smith is mentioned and features at Madame Tussauds museum in the 1969 Special Branch episode &#x27;You Don&#x27;t Exist&#x27;. A missing episode of &quot;Dead of Night&quot; (1972), a BBC2 paranormal anthology series, entitled &quot;Smith&quot; concerned Smith&#x27;s spirit possessing a man and re-enacting one of his murders. Silent Witness episode &quot;Fatal Error&quot; (2003) contains a reference to the case in connection with a series of murders based on forensic pathology textbook examples. There was also &quot;The Brides in the Bath&quot; (2003), a TV film made by Yorkshire Television, starring Martin Kemp as George Smith and the play &quot;Tryst&quot; by Karoline Leach, first produced in New York in 2006, starring Maxwell Caulfield and Amelia Campbell. This story is the basis for the Canadian play &quot;The Drowning Girls&quot; by Beth Graham, Charlie Tomlinson and Daniela Vlaskalic. In the episode &quot;Echoes of the Dead&quot; from the British TV detective series &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, DCI Barnaby solves a series of murders that revolve around &quot;Brides-in-the-bath&quot; murders with multiple references to the case including Smith, Spilsbury, and the forensic science of the period.

For some years, Smith&#x27;s waxwork was exhibited in the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussauds in London.

The 1949 movie &quot;Obsession&quot; mentions the brides in the bath case.

<text>The College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG) is a public engineering college situated in Chennai, India. It is Asia&#x27;s oldest technical institution, founded in 1794. It is also the oldest technical institution to be established outside Europe.

==History==

Due to the growing need for surveyors by the East India Company, the &#x27;School of Survey&#x27; was established in a building near Fort St. George on the suggestion of Michael Topping in 1794. This school was one of the first of its kind in the country and it started out with 8 students. It became the Civil Engineering School in 1858 and was renamed College of Engineering in 1859, with the inclusion of a mechanical engineering course. The college was shifted for a short period to Kalasa Mahal, Chepauk, before settling at its present location in 1920 as College of Engineering, Guindy.

College of Engineering, Guindy is one of the first institutes in India to offer degrees in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunication, highway engineering, printing technology, and materials science and engineering.

In 1978, College of Engineering, Guindy became a constituent college and the principal seat of Anna University.

Since 2019 the four flagship campuses of Anna University including the College of Engineering, Guindy were recommended to be recognized as an Institute of Eminence by the University Grants Commission of India. However, the Government of Tamil Nadu has rejected the Central Government&#x27;s offer for fear of loss of the quota of reservations for candidates from backward caste (BC), most backward caste (MBC) backgrounds. The Vice-Chancellor of the university, M. K. Surappa, along with the alumni body of the institution were in favour of attaining the recognition as an Institute of Eminence.

<text>Plant reproductive morphology is the study of the physical form and structure (the morphology) of those parts of plants directly or indirectly concerned with sexual reproduction.

Among all living organisms, flowers, which are the reproductive structures of angiosperms, are the most varied physically and show a correspondingly great diversity in methods of reproduction. Plants that are not flowering plants (green algae, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, ferns and gymnosperms such as conifers) also have complex interplays between morphological adaptation and environmental factors in their sexual reproduction. The breeding system, or how the sperm from one plant fertilizes the ovum of another, depends on the reproductive morphology, and is the single most important determinant of the genetic structure of nonclonal plant populations. Christian Konrad Sprengel (1793) studied the reproduction of flowering plants and for the first time it was understood that the pollination process involved both biotic and abiotic interactions. Charles Darwin&#x27;s theories of natural selection utilized this work to build his theory of evolution, which includes analysis of the coevolution of flowers and their insect pollinators.

== Use of sexual terminology ==
Plants have complex lifecycles involving alternation of generations. One generation, the sporophyte, gives rise to the next generation, the gametophyte asexually via spores. Spores may be identical isospores or come in different sizes (microspores and megaspores), but strictly speaking, spores and sporophytes are neither male nor female because they do not produce gametes. The alternate generation, the gametophyte, produces gametes, eggs and/or sperm. A gametophyte can be monoicous (bisexual), producing both eggs and sperm, or dioicous (unisexual), either female (producing eggs) or male (producing sperm).

In the bryophytes (liverworts, mosses, and hornworts), the sexual gametophyte is the dominant generation. In ferns and seed plants (including cycads, conifers, flowering plants, etc.) the sporophyte is the dominant generation; the obvious visible plant, whether a small herb or a large tree, is the sporophyte, and the gametophyte is very small. In bryophytes and ferns, the gametophytes are independent, free-living plants, while in seed plants, each female megagametophyte, and the megaspore that gives rise to it, is hidden within the sporophyte and is entirely dependent on it for nutrition. Each male gametophyte typically consists of two to four cells enclosed within the protective wall of a pollen grain.

The sporophyte of a flowering plant is often described using sexual terms (e.g. &quot;female&quot; or &quot;male&quot;) . For example, a sporophyte that produces spores that give rise only to male gametophytes may be described as &quot;male&quot;, even though the sporophyte itself is asexual, producing only spores. Similarly, flowers produced by the sporophyte may be described as &quot;unisexual&quot; or &quot;bisexual&quot;, meaning that they give rise to either one sex of gametophyte or both sexes of the gametophyte.

==Flowering plants==

===Basic flower morphology===
The flower is the characteristic structure concerned with sexual reproduction in flowering plants (angiosperms). Flowers vary enormously in their structure (morphology). A perfect flower, like that of &quot;Ranunculus glaberrimus&quot; shown in the figure, has a calyx of outer sepals and a corolla of inner petals and both male and female sex organs. The sepals and petals together form the perianth. Next inwards there are numerous stamens, which produce pollen grains, each containing a microscopic male gametophyte. Stamens may be called the &quot;male&quot; parts of a flower and collectively form the androecium. Finally in the middle there are carpels, which at maturity contain one or more ovules, and within each ovule is a tiny female gametophyte. Carpels may be called the &quot;female&quot; parts of a flower and collectively form the gynoecium.

Each carpel in &quot;Ranunculus&quot; species is an achene that produces one ovule, which when fertilized becomes a seed. If the carpel contains more than one seed, as in &quot;Eranthis hyemalis&quot;, it is called a follicle. Two or more carpels may be fused together to varying degrees and the entire structure, including the fused styles and stigmas may be called a pistil. The lower part of the pistil, where the ovules are produced, is called the ovary. It may be divided into chambers (locules) corresponding to the separate carpels.

===Variations===


A perfect flower has both stamens and carpels, and is described as &quot;bisexual&quot; or &quot;hermaphroditic&quot;. A unisexual flower is one in which either the stamens or the carpels are missing, vestigial or otherwise non-functional. Each flower is either staminate (having only functional stamens and thus male), or carpellate or pistillate (having only functional carpels and thus female). If separate staminate and carpellate flowers are always found on the same plant, the species is described as &quot;monoecious&quot;. If separate staminate and carpellate flowers are always found on different plants, the species is described as &quot;dioecious&quot;. A 1995 study found that about 6% of angiosperm species are dioecious, and that 7% of genera contain some dioecious species.

Members of the birch family (Betulaceae) are examples of monoecious plants with unisexual flowers. A mature alder tree (&quot;Alnus&quot; species) produces long catkins containing only male flowers, each with four stamens and a minute perianth, and separate stalked groups of female flowers, each without a perianth. (See the illustration of &quot;Alnus serrulata&quot;.)

Most hollies (members of the genus &quot;Ilex&quot;) are dioecious. Each plant produces either functionally male flowers or functionally female flowers. In &quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot; (see the illustration), the common European holly, both kinds of flower have four sepals and four white petals; male flowers have four stamens, female flowers usually have four non-functional reduced stamens and a four-celled ovary. Since only female plants are able to set fruit and produce berries, this has consequences for gardeners. &quot;Amborella&quot; represents the first known group of flowering plants to separate from their common ancestor. It too is dioecious; at any one time, each plant produces either flowers with functional stamens but no carpels, or flowers with a few non-functional stamens and a number of fully functional carpels. However, &quot;Amborella&quot; plants may change their &quot;sex&quot; over time. In one study, five cuttings from a male plant produced only male flowers when they first flowered, but at their second flowering three switched to producing female flowers.

In extreme cases, almost all of the parts present in a complete flower may be missing, so long as at least one carpel or one stamen is present. This situation is reached in the female flowers of duckweeds (&quot;Lemna&quot;), which consist of a single carpel, and in the male flowers of spurges (&quot;Euphorbia&quot;) which consist of a single stamen.

A species such as &quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;, the common ash of Europe, demonstrates one possible kind of variation. Ash flowers are wind-pollinated and lack petals and sepals. Structurally, the flowers may be bisexual, consisting of two stamens and an ovary, or may be male (staminate), lacking a functional ovary, or female (carpellate), lacking functional stamens. Different forms may occur on the same tree, or on different trees. The Asteraceae (sunflower family), with close to 22,000 species worldwide, have highly modified inflorescences made up of flowers (florets) collected together into tightly packed heads. Heads may have florets of one sexual morphology – all bisexual, all carpellate or all staminate (when they are called homogamous), or may have mixtures of two or more sexual forms (heterogamous). Thus goatsbeards (&quot;Tragopogon&quot; species) have heads of bisexual florets, like other members of the tribe Cichorieae, whereas marigolds (&quot;Calendula&quot; species) generally have heads with the outer florets bisexual and the inner florets staminate (male).

Like &quot;Amborella&quot;, some plants undergo sex-switching. For example, &quot;Arisaema triphyllum&quot; (Jack-in-the-pulpit) expresses sexual differences at different stages of growth: smaller plants produce all or mostly male flowers; as plants grow larger over the years the male flowers are replaced by more female flowers on the same plant. &quot;Arisaema triphyllum&quot; thus covers a multitude of sexual conditions in its lifetime: nonsexual juvenile plants, young plants that are all male, larger plants with a mix of both male and female flowers, and large plants that have mostly female flowers. Other plant populations have plants that produce more male flowers early in the year and as plants bloom later in the growing season they produce more female flowers.

===Terminology===

The complexity of the morphology of flowers and its variation within populations has led to a rich terminology.
* Androdioecious: having male flowers on some plants, bisexual ones on others.
* Androecious: having only male flowers (the male of a dioecious population); producing pollen but no seed.
* Androgynous: see bisexual.
* Androgynomonoecious: having male, female, and bisexual flowers on the same plant, also called trimonoecious.
* Andromonoecious: having both bisexual and male flowers on the same plant.
* Bisexual: each flower of each individual has both male and female structures, i.e. it combines both sexes in one structure. Flowers of this kind are called perfect, having both stamens and carpels. Other terms used for this condition are androgynous, hermaphroditic, monoclinous and synoecious.
* Dichogamous: having sexes developing at different times; producing pollen when the stigmas are not receptive, either protandrous or protogynous. This promotes outcrossing by limiting self-pollination. Some dichogamous plants have bisexual flowers, others have unisexual flowers.
* Diclinous: see Unisexual.
* Dioecious: having either only male or only female flowers. No individual plant of the population produces both pollen and ovules. (From the Greek for &quot;two households&quot;. See also the Wiktionary entry for .)
* Gynodioecious: having hermaphrodite flowers and female flowers on separate plants.
* Gynoecious: having only female flowers (the female of a dioecious population); producing seed but not pollen.
* Gynomonoecious: having both bisexual and female flowers on the same plant.
* Hermaphroditic: see bisexual.
* Homogamous: male and female sexes reach maturity in synchrony; producing mature pollens when stigma is receptive.
* Imperfect: (of flowers) having some parts that are normally present not developed, e.g. lacking stamens. See also Unisexual.
* Monoclinous: see bisexual.
* Monoecious: In the commoner narrow sense of the term, it refers to plants with unisexual flowers which occur on the same individual. In the broad sense of the term, it also includes plants with bisexual flowers. Individuals bearing separate flowers of both sexes at the same time are called simultaneously or synchronously monoecious and individuals that bear flowers of one sex at one time are called consecutively monoecious. (From the Greek &quot;monos&quot; &quot;single&quot; + &quot;oikia&quot; &quot;house&quot;. See also the Wiktionary entry for .)
* Perfect: (of flowers) see bisexual.
* Polygamodioecious: mostly dioecious, but with either a few flowers of the opposite sex or a few bisexual flowers on the same plant.
* Polygamomonoecious: see polygamous. Or, mostly monoecious, but also partly polygamous.
* Polygamous: having male, female, and bisexual flowers on the same plant. Also called polygamomonoecious or trimonoecious. Or, with bisexual and at least one of male and female flowers on the same plant.
* Protandrous: (of dichogamous plants) having male parts of flowers developed before female parts, e.g. having flowers that function first as male and then change to female or producing pollen before the stigmas of the same plant are receptive. (Protoandrous is also used.)
* Protogynous: (of dichogamous plants) having female parts of flowers developed before male parts, e.g. having flowers that function first as female and then change to male or producing pollen after the stigmas of the same plant are receptive.
* Subandroecious: having mostly male flowers, with a few female or bisexual flowers.
* Subdioecious: having some individuals in otherwise dioecious populations with flowers that are not clearly male or female. The population produces normally male or female plants with unisexual flowers, but some plants may have bisexual flowers, some both male and female flowers, and others some combination thereof, such as female and bisexual flowers. The condition is thought to represent a transition between bisexuality and dioecy.
* Subgynoecious: having mostly female flowers, with a few male or bisexual flowers.
* Synoecious: see bisexual.
* Trimonoecious: see polygamous and androgynomonoecious.
* Trioecious: with male, female and bisexual flowers on different plants.
* Unisexual: having either functionally male or functionally female flowers. This condition is also called diclinous, incomplete or imperfect.

===Outcrossing===

Outcrossing, cross-fertilization or allogamy, in which offspring are formed by the fusion of the gametes of two different plants, is the most common mode of reproduction among higher plants. About 55% of higher plant species reproduce in this way. An additional 7% are partially cross-fertilizing and partially self-fertilizing (autogamy). About 15% produce gametes but are principally self-fertilizing with significant out-crossing lacking. Only about 8% of higher plant species reproduce exclusively by non-sexual means. These include plants that reproduce vegetatively by runners or bulbils, or which produce seeds without embryo fertilization (apomixis). The selective advantage of outcrossing appears to be the masking of deleterious recessive mutations.

The primary mechanism used by flowering plants to ensure outcrossing involves a genetic mechanism known as self-incompatibility. Various aspects of floral morphology promote allogamy. In plants with bisexual flowers, the anthers and carpels may mature at different times, plants being protandrous (with the anthers maturing first) or protogynous (with the carpels mature first). Monoecious species, with unisexual flowers on the same plant, may produce male and female flowers at different times.

Dioecy, the condition of having unisexual flowers on different plants, necessarily results in outcrossing, and probably evolved for this purpose. However, &quot;dioecy has proven difficult to explain simply as an outbreeding mechanism in plants that lack self-incompatibility&quot;. Resource-allocation constraints may be important in the evolution of dioecy, for example, with wind-pollination, separate male flowers arranged in a catkin that vibrates in the wind may provide better pollen dispersal. In climbing plants, rapid upward growth may be essential, and resource allocation to fruit production may be incompatible with rapid growth, thus giving an advantage to delayed production of female flowers. Dioecy has evolved separately in many different lineages, and monoecy in the plant lineage correlates with the evolution of dioecy, suggesting that dioecy can evolve more readily from plants that already produce separate male and female flowers.

<text>The Krupp K5 was a heavy railway gun used by Nazi Germany throughout World War II.

==Description==
Krupp&#x27;s K5 series were consistent in mounting a gun barrel in a fixed mounting with only vertical elevation of the weapon. This gondola was then mounted on a pair of 12-wheel bogies designed to be operated on commercial and military rails built to German standards. This mounting permitted only two degrees of horizontal traverse. The carriage had to be aligned on the rails first, with only minimal fine leveling capable once halted. Hence the gun could only fire at targets tangential to an existing railway track.

To track targets needing greater traverse either a curved length of railway was used with the gun shunted backwards or forwards to aim; a cross-track was laid with the front bogie turned perpendicular to the rest of the gun and moved up and down the cross-track to train the weapon; or for 360 degree traverse, the &quot;Vögele Turntable&quot; could be constructed, consisting of a raised rail section (the &quot;firing bed&quot;) carrying the gun, running on a circular track with a central jack to raise the gun during traverse and to take some of the enormous weight.

The main barrel of the K5 is in calibre, and is rifled with twelve grooves. These were originally deep, but were made shallower to rectify cracking problems.

==History==

The K5 was the result of a crash program launched in the 1930s to develop a force of railway guns to support the Wehrmacht by 1939. K5 development began in 1934 with first testing following in 1936 at Darlowo (German: &quot;Schießplatz Rügenwalde-Bad&quot;) in the former Farther Pomerania at the South coast of the Baltic Sea. Initial tests were done with a 150 mm barrel under the designation &quot;K5M&quot;.

Production led to eight guns being in service for the Invasion of France, although problems were encountered with barrel splitting and rectified with changes to the rifling. The guns were then reliable until the end of the war, under the designation &quot;K5 Tiefzug 7 mm&quot;. Three were installed on the English Channel coast and were intended to target British shipping in the Channel, but proved unsuccessful.

Two K5 guns, named &quot;Robert&quot; and &quot;Leopold&quot; by German crews, were shipped to Italy to help counter the Allied landing at the town of Anzio in February 1944. The Allied soldiers stuck on the beach nicknamed the two German guns &quot;Anzio Annie&quot; and &quot;Anzio Express&quot; due to the express train-like sound the shells generated. On 18 May 1944 the guns fired off their remaining ammunition and then escaped along the coastal railroad into the rail yard in Civitavecchia, in preparation for evacuation. This proved impossible and the guns were destroyed by their crews.

Towards the end of the war, longer-range rocket-assisted projectiles were successfully fired from the &quot;K5Vz&quot;.

A final experiment was to bore out two of the weapons to smoothbore to allow firing of the Peenemünder Pfeilgeschosse arrow shells. These were designated &quot;K5 Glatt&quot;.

Other proposals to modify or create new models of the K5 never saw production, including one that could leave the railway with modified Tiger II tank chassis replacing the two railroad bogies. This project ended with the defeat of Nazi Germany.

==Projectiles==
Two types of high-explosive projectile were used with the K5. The &quot;28cm G35&quot; weighed and contained a charge of of TNT. The &quot;28cm Gr.39 m. Hbgr. Z.&quot; was slightly heavier, weighing and containing around of TNT. These projectiles were pre-rifled with angled splines along their midsection which were aligned with the guns rifling before firing.

The rocket-assisted projectile was known as the &quot;28cm R. GR.4351&quot;. This carried of explosive and was boosted by around of double-base powder rocket propellant. The total weight was . 19 seconds after firing the rocket motor was ignited and the projectile was accelerated through the stratosphere. When the rocket burnt out, the center section containing the rocket motor fell away and the projectile continued on its course. The maximum range for this projectile was , but, due to the weight of the rocket motor, the projectile carried less explosives.

==Surviving guns==
The guns were discovered on a railroad siding in the town of Civitavecchia, on 7 June 1944, shortly after the allies had liberated Rome. &quot;Robert&quot; had been partially destroyed by the gun crew before they surrendered and &quot;Leopold&quot; was also damaged, but not as badly.

Today, K5(E) is preserved at the United States Army Ordnance Museum in Fort Gregg-Adams (Petersburg, Virginia). &quot;Leopold&quot; was shipped to the United States Aberdeen Proving Ground, (Aberdeen, Maryland) where it underwent tests and evaluations. In early 2011 it was moved to Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia as a result of the 2005 Base Relocation and Closure (BRAC) Act.

A second surviving gun can be seen at the &quot;Batterie Todt&quot; museum, near Audinghen in northern France.

<text>Count Ivan Davidovich Delyanov () (December 12, 1818 in Moscow – January 10, 1898) was a Russian statesman of Armenian descent and a son of Delyanov David Artemyevich, a Major-General of the Russian Imperial Army.

==Biography==
Delyanov graduated from Moscow State University&#x27;s Law School in 1838. In 1857 – 1897, he held a number of important governmental positions. Delyanov became a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia in 1874. In 1861 – 1882, he was a director of the National Library of Russia in St Petersburg. In 1882 – 1897, Delyanov held a post of the minister of public education. He introduced a new University charter in 1884, which would deprive universities of their former autonomy. Delyanov also closed down the universities for women (Bestuzhev Courses) in 1886.

On June 18, 1887, he issued a circular, which would limit the admittance of children of the non-noble origin to the gymnasiums. According to this document, gymnasiums and progymnasiums had to restrict the enrollment of children of people of lower classes.

The circular stated in part that the new rules free the gymnasiums from &quot;children of coachmen, lackeys, cooks, laundresses, petty merchants, with the possible exceptions for those endowed with extraordinary abilities, — all those who should not altogether be taken out the environment they belong to.&quot; For this reason it has become known as the Cookwomen&#x27;s Children Circular (Циркуляр о кухаркиных детях). This discriminatory language was capitalized upon by Russian revolutionaries and was the base of the famous phrase of Vladimir Lenin that in the Soviet Union &quot;even a cookwoman may manage the state&quot;.

Delyanov also introduced a certain percentage for accepting the Jews in educational institutions. National minority schools were subject to mandatory russification.

<doc id="971988" wikidata="Q896086" url="?curid=971988" title="List of Russian monarchs">
<text>This is a list of all reigning monarchs in the history of Russia. The list begins with the semi-legendary prince Rurik of Novgorod, sometime in the mid-9th century, and ends with Nicholas II, who abdicated in 1917, and was executed with his family in 1918. Two dynasties have ruled Russia: the Rurikids (862–1598) and Romanovs (from 1613).

The vast territory known as Russia covers an area that has been ruled by various polities since the 9th century, including Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Grand Principality of Vladimir, the Grand Principality of Moscow, the Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire, and the sovereigns of these polities have used a range of titles. Some of the earliest titles include &quot;knyaz&quot; and &quot;veliky knyaz&quot;, which mean &quot;prince&quot; and &quot;grand prince&quot; respectively, and have sometimes been rendered as &quot;duke&quot; and &quot;grand duke&quot; in Western literature. After the centralized Russian state was formed, this was followed by the title of tsar, meaning &quot;caesar&quot;, which was disputed to be the equal of either a king or emperor, and finally the title of emperor.

According to Article 59 of the 1906 Russian constitution, the Russian emperor held several dozen titles, each one representing a region which the monarch governed.

== Rurikids (862–1598) ==

=== Princes of Novgorod===
In traditional historiography, the first Russian monarch is considered to be the semi-legendary Rurik, the first prince of Novgorod.

=== Grand princes of Kiev===
Rurik&#x27;s successor Oleg moved his capital to Kiev, founding a state denoted in modern historiography as Kievan Rus&#x27; () or Ancient Rus&#x27; (). Over the next several centuries, the most important titles were grand prince of Kiev and prince of Novgorod, whose holder (often the same person) could claim hegemony.

==== Feudal period ====

The gradual disintegration of Kievan Rus&#x27; began in the 11th century, after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The position of the grand prince was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans. In 1097, the Council of Liubech formalized the feudal nature of the lands. The Liubech conference resulted in the creation of a federative structure, with the different principalities within the structure remaining bound to Kiev as the center of the state. This structure allowed for some of the principalities to develop into semi-independent polities, with conflict between the principalities intensifying in the 12th century.

After Mstislav&#x27;s death in 1132, Kievan Rus&#x27; fell into recession and a rapid decline, marking the end of a unified state. The throne of Kiev became an object of struggle between various territorial associations of Rurikid princes in the decades to come, despite Kiev losing almost all of its former glory and power.

In March 1169, a coalition of princes led by the grand prince of Vladimir, Andrey Bogolyubsky, sacked Kiev and forced the ruling prince, Mstislav II, to flee to Volhynia. Andrei appointed his brother, Gleb, as the prince of Kiev, while Andrei himself continued to rule his realm from Vladimir-on-the-Klyazma. Andrei styled himself as the grand prince of Vladimir, although the less important prince in Kiev would still bear the title of grand prince; the last prince to bear the title of grand prince of Kiev was Michael of Chernigov, who died in 1246, while the grand princes of Vladimir retained their title. The other future grand princely titles were derived from the grand princely title of Vladimir.

From that time onwards, Vladimir became one of the most influential principalities. In the south-west, the principality of Galicia-Volhynia began to emerge as a local successor to Kiev. Following the Mongol invasions, three powerful states emerged: the Grand Principality of Vladimir in the north-east, which would evolve into the Grand Principality of Moscow and become the center of the autocratic Russian state; the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia in the south-west, which was later annexed by Poland and Lithuania; and the Novgorod Republic in the north.

=== Grand princes of Vladimir===
By the 12th century, the Grand Principality of Vladimir became the dominant principality in the north-east, adding its name to those of Novgorod and Kiev, culminating with the rule of Alexander Nevsky. In 1169, Andrey I&#x27;s son sacked the city of Kiev, but Andrey instead stayed in Vladimir and made it his capital, while taking the title of grand prince to claim primacy, leading to political power being shifted to the north-east.

Following the Mongol invasions, the principalities started paying tribute to the Golden Horde (the so-called &quot;Tatar yoke&quot;). Until the 15th century, Russian princes received a &quot;yarlyk&quot; from the khan; it was not until about 1480 that the Mongol domination of Russia formally ended.

After the death of Alexander Nevsky, the Grand Principality of Vladimir split into various appanage principalities, with Alexander&#x27;s youngest son Daniel being the first permanent ruler of Moscow. The territory of Vladimir proper was received by the Horde to one of the appanage princes, who performed the enthronement ceremony in Vladimir, but remained to live and reign in his own principality. By the end of the century, only three cities – Moscow, Tver, and Nizhny Novgorod – still contended for the title of grand prince of Vladimir. The grand princely title occasionally reverted to Tver, but in the end, the Moscow branch of Rurikids established by Daniel successfully claimed the title for themselves exclusively.

Ivan I was able to collect tribute from the Russian princes to the Golden Horde and his reign saw a significant strengthening of Moscow as Ivan increased its wealth and purchased more land, including entire appanages from bankrupt princes. Ivan was also able to convince the head of the Russian Orthodox Church to move to Moscow, and Vladimir remained in the hands of the princes of Moscow. Ivan&#x27;s son Simeon was the first prince to adopt the style of grand prince of Moscow and Vladimir.

The princes of Moscow and Suzdal entered a struggle for the grand princely title following the death of Ivan II, with Ivan&#x27;s son Dmitry Ivanovich (later known as Dmitry Donskoy) taking the throne from Dmitry Konstantinovich in 1363. The Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 marked a turning point, with the prince of Moscow seen as the dominant prince.

After the death of Dmitry Donskoy, the throne of Vladimir was passed to the prince of Moscow, thus usurping the right of the khan to appoint the grand prince. The grand princes of Moscow later adopted the title of sovereign and grand prince of all Russia, with the unification of other principalities with Moscow cultivating a sense of an imperial role for the grand prince as the ruler of all Russia.

=== Grand princes of Moscow===
The Russians began to exert independence from the Mongols, culminating with Ivan III ceasing tribute to the Horde, effectively declaring his independence. Ivan III also greatly expanded his domain with the annexations of other principalities; his son Vasili III completed the task of uniting all of Russia by annexing the last few independent states in the 1520s.

Princely succession in medieval Russia proceeded along the lines of the eldest son usually being the being chosen, with the condition that substitution did not take place if the father died before the grandfather. The grand princes of Moscow, once they entrenched their status as the supreme prince with regard to other Russian princes, typically left a will in which they appointed their eldest son as heirs to the title of grand prince; this did not fully conform to traditional succession practices, and in 1497, Ivan III went one step further by crowning his grandson Dmitry as co-ruler, bypassing his son Vasily, who, according to the traditional system, would have been the heir, although in the end Vasily was made co-ruler and this arrangement did not work out. Ivan III also used the title of tsar in his foreign correspondence, but it would be his grandson Ivan IV who would be crowned as the first Russian tsar.

=== Tsars of Russia ===

Ivan IV (&quot;the Terrible&quot;) assumed the title of tsar in 1547. Succession was treated in an unorthodox manner under Ivan IV, who, in 1575, formally transferred his powers to Simeon Bekbulatovich, a Tatar prince who had been baptized and given his own principality; Ivan returned to the throne the following year. Ivan was succeeded in 1584 by his only surviving son, Feodor, who died without an heir, marking the end of the Rurik dynasty.

== Time of Troubles (1598–1613) ==
===Tsars of Russia===
In 1581, Ivan the Terrible killed his firstborn son Ivan Ivanovich in a fit of rage, leaving only Feodor I to succeed him. Feodor died childless, marking the end of the Rurik dynasty and the start of a succession crisis during a period known as the Time of Troubles. The first non-Rurikid tsar was Feodor&#x27;s brother-in-law and regent, the influent boyar Boris Godunov, elected by the Zemsky Sobor (feudal parliament).

Devastated by famine, rule under Boris descended into anarchy. There followed a series of impostors, known as the False Dmitrys, each claiming to be Feodor I&#x27;s long deceased younger brother; however, only the first impostor ever took the capital and sat on the throne. A distant Rurikid cousin, Vasily Shuysky, also took power for a time. During this period foreign powers deeply involved themselves in Russian politics, under the leadership of the Vasa monarchs of Sweden and Poland-Lithuania, including Sigismund III Vasa and his son Władysław. As a child, Władysław was even chosen as tsar by the council of aristocracy, though he was prevented by his father from formally taking the throne. The Time of Troubles is considered to have ended with the election of Michael Romanov to the throne in February 1613, thereby establishing the Romanov dynasty.

== Romanovs (1613–1917) ==
=== Tsars of Russia ===
The Time of Troubles came to a close with the election of Michael Romanov as tsar in 1613. Michael officially reigned as tsar, though his father, the patriarch Philaret (died 1633) initially held &quot;de facto&quot; power. However, Michael&#x27;s descendants would rule Russia, first as tsars and later as emperors, until the Russian Revolution of 1917. Michael was succeeded by his only son, Alexis, who in turn was succeeded by his eldest son of his first marriage, Feodor.

Following the death of Feodor, there were two candidates for the throne: his brother Ivan and his half-brother Peter, who were fifteen and nine years old, respectively. Each candidate was supported by a competing clan, the Miloslavskys and Naryshkins. At first, the throne was given to Peter, but as a result of the &quot;streltsy&quot; uprising in Moscow, a compromise solution was found and both Peter and Ivan were made co-monarchs in 1682, with Ivan&#x27;s older sister Sophia ruling as regent. Ivan was considered the senior tsar and Peter the junior tsar; however, due to Ivan being considered unfit for the role, Peter was able to remove his half-sister Sophia from power and take control of the throne at the age of 17 with the assistance of another &quot;streltsy&quot; uprising in 1689. Peter then became the sole monarch in 1696 upon the death of Ivan.

=== Emperors of Russia ===
The Russian Empire was proclaimed by Peter the Great in 1721 following the creation of the imperial title in the aftermath of the Great Northern War. Russia&#x27;s territorial gains and increased standing as a key player on the European scene allowed it to upgrade its official status from tsardom to empire. The full imperial title proposed in 1721 to Peter was &quot;Father of the Fatherland, Peter the Great, All-Russian Emperor&quot;. At his accession as the sole monarch of Russia in 1696, Peter held the same title as his father, Alexis: &quot;Great Lord Tsar and Grand Prince, Autocrat of Great, Small and White Russia&quot;. By 1710, he had styled himself as &quot;Tsar and All-Russian Emperor&quot;, but it was not until 1721 that the imperial title became official. The adjective &quot;All-Russian&quot; had been increasingly used to refer to the territories of modern-day Belarus and Ukraine as well.

Peter issued a decree in 1722 in which the sovereign would be free to appoint a successor, referring to a number of historical precedents, including the conduct of Ivan III, who initially chose his grandson as his successor. This was later detailed in &quot;Pravda voli Monarshei v opredelenii Naslednika Derzhavy Sovei&quot; (&quot;The righteousness of the monarch&#x27;s will in appointing the successor in his reign&quot;), a major political treatise written in its defense, which was only circulated widely following Peter&#x27;s death, and argued on the basis of an abundance of examples from both biblical and secular history that it was fully correct for a ruler to appoint his own successor without being bound by traditional family succession rules. Peter died in 1725 without naming a successor.

Officially, Russia would be ruled by the Romanov dynasty until the Russian Revolution of 1917. However, direct male descendants of Michael Romanov came to an end in 1730 with the death of Peter II of Russia, grandson of Peter the Great. The throne passed to Anna, a niece of Peter the Great, and after the brief rule of her niece&#x27;s infant son Ivan VI, the throne was seized by Elizabeth, a daughter of Peter the Great. Elizabeth would be the last of the direct Romanovs to rule Russia. Elizabeth declared her nephew, Peter, to be her heir. Peter, who would rule as Peter III, was a German prince of the House of Holstein-Gottorp before arriving in Russia to assume the imperial title. He and his German wife Sophia changed their name to Romanov upon inheriting the throne. Peter was ill-liked, and he was assassinated within six months of assuming the throne, in a coup orchestrated by his wife, who became Empress in her own right and ruled as Catherine the Great. Following the confused successions of the descendants of Peter the Great, Catherine&#x27;s son Paul I established clear succession laws which governed the rules of primogeniture over the imperial throne until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917.

=== Pretenders after Nicholas II ===

The rights of Kirill Vladimirovich and his heirs to the imperial throne of Russia have been repeatedly questioned following his marriage with Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The principles laid down by Paul I in the Act of Succession 1797 turned out to be not completely flawlessly formulated, and, as a result, the interpretation of these is not always obvious, and Russia now has no indisputable contender for the throne. Moreover, for more than a hundred years the throne itself has ceased to exist. Nevertheless, when in 1915 Nicholas II, before the lack of successible grand dukes, allowed them to retain their personal rights, as it had happened in practice with Alexander II after his second and morganatic marriage, Kirill Vladimirovich&#x27;s issue was never deemed to be considered morganatic, nor were they demoted from grand dukes to mere princes.

<doc id="971997" wikidata="Q7243624" url="?curid=971997" title="Primordial sandwich">
<text>The concept of the primordial sandwich was proposed by the chemist Günter Wächtershäuser to describe the possible origins of the first cell membranes, and, therefore, the first cell.

According to the two main models of abiogenesis, RNA world and iron-sulfur world, prebiotic processes existed &quot;before&quot; the development of the cell membrane. The difficulty with this idea, however, is that it is almost impossible to create a complex molecule such as RNA (or even its molecular precursor, pre-RNA) directly from simple organic molecules dissolved in a global ocean (Joyce, 1991), because without some mechanism to concentrate these organic molecules, they would be too dilute to generate the necessary chemical reactions to transform them from simple organic molecules into genuine prebiotic molecules.

To address this problem, Wächtershäuser proposed that concentration might occur by concentration upon (&quot;adsorption to&quot;) the surfaces of minerals. With the accumulation of enough amphipathic molecules (such as phospholipids), a bilayer will self-organize, and any molecules caught inside will become the contents of a liposome, and would be concentrated enough to allow chemical reactions to transform organic molecules into prebiotic molecules.

Although developed for his own iron-sulfur world model, the idea of the &quot;primordial sandwich&quot; has also been adopted by some adherents of the RNA world model.

<doc id="972005" wikidata="Q786735" url="?curid=972005" title="Autofrettage">
<text>Autofrettage is a work-hardening process in which a pressure vessel (thick walled) is subjected to enormous pressure, causing internal portions of the part to yield plastically, resulting in internal compressive residual stresses once the pressure is released. The goal of autofrettage is to increase the pressure-carrying capacity of the final product. Inducing residual compressive stresses into materials can also increase their resistance to stress corrosion cracking; that is, non-mechanically assisted cracking that occurs when a material is placed in a corrosive environment in the presence of tensile stress. The technique is commonly used in manufacture of high-pressure pump cylinders, warship and gun barrels, and fuel injection systems for diesel engines. Due to work-hardening process it also enhances wear life of the barrel marginally. While autofrettage will induce some work hardening, that is not the primary mechanism of strengthening.
The start point is a single steel tube of internal diameter slightly less than the desired calibre. The tube is subjected to internal pressure of sufficient magnitude to enlarge the bore and in the process the inner layers of the metal are stretched in tension beyond their elastic limit. This means that the inner layers have been stretched to a point where the steel is no longer able to return to its original shape once the internal pressure has been removed. Although the outer layers of the tube are also stretched, the degree of internal pressure applied during the process is such that they are not stretched beyond their elastic limit. The reason why this is possible is that the stress distribution through the walls of the tube is non-uniform. Its maximum value occurs in the metal adjacent to the source of pressure, decreasing markedly towards the outer layers of the tube. The strain is proportional to the stress applied within the elastic limit; therefore the expansion at the outer layers is less than at the bore. Because the outer layers remain elastic they attempt to return to their original shape; however, they are prevented from doing so completely by the new permanently stretched inner layers. The effect is that the inner layers of the metal are put under compression by the outer layers in much the same way as though an outer layer of metal had been shrunk on as with a built-up gun. This can be better understood by assuming thick walled tube as multilayer tube. The next step is to subject the compressively strained inner layers to a low-temperature treatment (LTT) which results in the elastic limit being raised to at least the autofrettage pressure employed in the first stage of the process. Finally, the elasticity of the barrel can be tested by applying internal pressure once more, but this time care is taken to ensure that the inner layers are not stretched beyond their new elastic limit. The end result is an inner surface of the gun barrel with a residual compressive stress able to counterbalance the tensile stress that would be induced when the gun is discharged. In addition the material has a higher tensile strength due to work hardening. 

Early in the history of artillery, people observed that, after firing a small number of rounds, the bore of a new gun slightly enlarges and hardens. Historically, the first type of autofrettage avant la lettre was mandrelling bronze gun barrels, invented and patented in 1869 by Samuel B. Dean of the South Boston Iron Company. But it found no use on the American continent and was copied without a license by Franz von Uchatius in mid-1870s. It found some use in several European countries lacking steel industry, but was quickly displaced by cast steel everywhere except Austro-Hungary, which stuck to the obsolete technology until WWI and therefore had their artillery handicapped.

The problem of strengthening steel gun barrels using the same principle was tackled by French colonial artillery colonel Louis Frédéric Gustave Jacob, who suggested in 1907 to pressurize them hydraulically and coined the term &quot;autofrettage&quot;. In 1913, Schneider-Creusot made a 14 cm L/50 naval gun by such a method and applied for a patent. However, implementing such a technique on an industrial scale required numerical methods to approximate the solutions of transcedental equations of plastic deformation, which were developed in France during WWI by math professor Maurice d&#x27;Ocagne and Schneider engineer Louis Potin.

In modern practice, a slightly oversized die is pushed slowly through the barrel by a hydraulically driven ram. The amount of initial underbore and oversize of the die are calculated to strain the material around the bore past its elastic limit into plastic deformation. A residual compressive stress remains on the barrel&#x27;s inner surface, even after final honing and rifling.

The technique has been applied to the expansion of tubular components down hole in oil and gas wells. The method has been patented by the Norwegian oil service company, Meta, which uses it to connect concentric tubular components with sealing and strength properties outlined above.

The term autofrettage is also used to describe a step in manufacturing of composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) where the liner is expanded (by plastic deformation), inside the composite overwrap.

<text>Anderson is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It is located to the northwest of the crater Sharonov, and the satellite crater Sharanov X is attached to the southeast rim of Anderson. To the northeast is the peculiar formation Buys-Ballot, and to the east-southeast lies the larger crater Spencer Jones.

The outer rim of Anderson is heavily worn and eroded. Small craters overlie the southeastern and southwestern rims. The interior is relatively flat, with multiple tiny craters covering parts of the floor. The most prominent of these is Anderson L, located near the southeastern rim. Anderson L is also commonly known as the Anderson Finger.

The crater lies within the Freundlich-Sharonov Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Anderson.
Anderson E and F have fractured floors.

<doc id="972016" wikidata="Q598608" url="?curid=972016" title="Antoniadi (lunar crater)">
<text>Antoniadi is a large lunar impact crater that lies on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The crater intrudes into the southeastern rim of the crater Minnaert, a slightly smaller formation that is significantly more eroded. Attached to the eastern rim of Antoniadi is Numerov, another large, ancient crater similar to Minnaert. Due south of Antoniadi is the small crater Brashear.

Antoniadi is one of the largest craters of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Geography==
The outer rim of Antoniadi is generally circular, with an irregular edge that has multiple indentations all about the perimeter. The wall is only lightly eroded, and retains a crisp rim and terracing on the inner walls. Only a single small craterlet of note lies across the interior wall, near the southeast edge of the rim.

Antoniadi is one of the few craters on the Moon that possesses both a second inner ring and a central peak. This inner ring formation is about half the diameter of the outer wall, and only rugged mountain segments of the ring to the north and south still remain. The western part of the inner ring is almost non-existent, and only a few minor hills remain to the east.

The floor within the inner wall is unusually flat and smooth, with the central peak being the only notable feature. The floor outside the inner ring is much rougher in texture. The most notable crater on the interior floor lies across the eastern edge of the southern inner ring range.

===Lowest Point on the Moon===

The bottom of a small unnamed crater within Antoniadi crater was measured by the laser altimeter (LALT) instrument on board the Japanese Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) satellite to be the lowest point on the moon, at Lunar latitude 70.43° S, longitude 187.42° E. The point is 9.178 km below the average lunar geoid. The measurement was confirmed by laser altimetry data from the Chang&#x27;e 1 orbiter, which further refined the location to latitude 70.368° S, longitude 172.413° W.

The lowest point has been unofficially named &quot;Point Trieste&quot; after the Bathyscaphe Trieste, the first vehicle to descend to the Earth&#x27;s deepest point.

<text>A zigzag is a pattern made up of small corners at variable angles, though constant within the zigzag, tracing a path between two parallel lines; it can be described as both jagged and fairly regular.

In geometry, this pattern is described as a skew apeirogon. From the point of view of symmetry, a regular zigzag can be generated from a simple motif like a line segment by repeated application of a glide reflection.

Although the origin of the word is unclear, its first printed appearances were in French-language books and ephemera of the late 17th century.

==Examples of zigzags==

* The trace of a triangle wave or a sawtooth wave is a zigzag.
* Pinking shears are designed to cut cloth or paper with a zigzag edge, to lessen fraying.
* In sewing, a &quot;zigzag stitch&quot; is a machine stitch in a zigzag pattern.
* The zigzag arch is an architectural embellishment used in Islamic, Byzantine, Norman and Romanesque architecture.
* In seismology, earthquakes recorded in a &quot;zigzag line&quot; form by using seismograph.

<text>Leon Bibel (1913–1995) was a Polish-born American painter and printmaker during the Great Depression. His themes were the social condition of workers and the politics of protest and war, although cityscapes and landscapes were included among his works. He later developed works in wood of especially Jewish themes. These included fanciful miniature buildings influenced by European spice boxes, figures and objects within shadow boxes, and in one case a synagogue ark, which still stands at Congregation B&#x27;nai Tikvah in North Brunswick, NJ, along with a Tallit holder he created and several other items.

Leon Bibel was born in Poland, growing up in the shtetl of Szczebrzeszyn. He immigrated to the United States with his family. After graduating from Polytechnic High School in San Francisco, he trained at the California School of Fine Arts and apprenticed under the German Impressionist Maria Riedelstein and assisted Bernard Zakheim (a student of Diego Rivera), on the frescoes of the San Francisco Jewish Community Center and the University of California at San Francisco&#x27;s Toland Hall. He resided in New York beginning in 1936 as a WPA artist of the Federal Art Project at the Harlem Community Art Center in New York City. He also taught art at both P.S. 94 and Bronx House. At the start of the Second World War, he and a number of other New York artists moved to South Brunswick, New Jersey, to make a living as chicken farmers. By the 1960s, Bibel returned to art, focusing on wood-based sculptures. He died in 1995.

He was a friend and neighbor of the American sculptor George Segal, and was both an anonymous and named character of Segal&#x27;s arrays and portraits. (He is the first man in &quot;Depression Bread Line&quot;, Segal&#x27;s group of bronzed figures at the FDR Memorial, included in PBS’s &quot;George Segal: American Still Life&quot;).

== Holdings and exhibitions ==
Bibel&#x27;s work may be found at Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the B&#x27;nai Brith&#x27;s Klutznick Museum, and the museums of Rutgers University and Princeton Universities.

Bibel&#x27;s work has been featured in posthumous exhibitions in Philadelphia in 2011 and in Virginia in 2013.

<doc id="972026" wikidata="Q1093287" url="?curid=972026" title="Gunn–Peterson trough">
<text>In astronomical spectroscopy, the Gunn–Peterson trough is a feature of the spectra of bright high redshift sources, particularly quasars and gamma-ray burst afterglows, due to the presence of neutral hydrogen in the Intergalactic medium (IGM). The trough is characterized by suppression of electromagnetic emission from the source at wavelengths less than that of the Lyman-alpha line at the redshift of the emitted light. This effect was originally predicted in 1965 by James E. Gunn and Bruce Peterson, and independently by Peter Scheuer.

==First detection==
For over three decades after the prediction, no objects had been found distant enough to show the Gunn–Peterson trough. It was not until 2001, with the discovery of a quasar with a redshift &quot;z&quot; = 6.28 by Robert Becker and others using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, that a Gunn–Peterson trough was finally observed. The article also included quasars at redshifts of &quot;z&quot; = 5.82 and &quot;z&quot; = 5.99, and, while each of these exhibited absorption at wavelengths on the blue side of the Lyman-alpha transition, there were numerous spikes in flux as well. The flux of the quasar at &quot;z&quot; = 6.28, however, was effectively zero beyond the Lyman-alpha limit, meaning that the neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM must have been larger than ~10−3.

==Evidence for reionization==
The discovery of the trough in a &quot;z&quot; = 6.28 quasar, and the absence of the trough in quasars detected at redshifts just below &quot;z&quot; = 6 presented strong evidence for the hydrogen in the universe undergoing a transition from neutral to ionized around &quot;z&quot; = 6. Detection of a trough as low as z ≈ 5.6 by George D. Becker and others in 2015 suggests that reionization of the universe is inhomogenous and incomplete at z = 5.6. After recombination, the universe was expected to be neutral, until the first objects in the universe started emitting light and energy which would reionize the surrounding IGM. However, as the scattering cross section of photons with energies near that of the Lyman-alpha limit with neutral hydrogen is very high, even a small fraction of neutral hydrogen will make the optical depth of the IGM high enough to cause the suppression of emission observed. Despite the fact that the ratio of neutral hydrogen to ionized hydrogen may not have been particularly high, the low flux observed past the Lyman-alpha limit indicates that the universe was in the final stages of reionization.

Following the first release of data from the WMAP spacecraft in 2003, the determination by Becker that the end of reionization occurred at &quot;z&quot; ≈ 6 appeared to conflict with estimates made from the WMAP measurement of the electron column density. However, the WMAP III data released in 2006 now seems to be in much better agreement with the limits on reionization placed by observation of the Gunn–Peterson trough.

Recent observations of quasi-stellar objects have shown strong absorption gaps in regions with redshifts as low as z ≈ 5.3 indicating that reionization was not uniformly spread through the IGM. Simulations have shown that low-mass galaxies could have initially contributed to reionization until their star formation was radiatively suppressed, potentially explaining these islands of neutral hydrogen persisting at lower redshifts.

It has also been shown that islands of neutral hydrogen cannot account for absorption gaps alone, leading to investigation of dense systems within ionized regions of the IGM referred to as Lyman Limit Systems or small scale absorbers. This is supported by the abundance of these systems in the post-reionization era as neutral hydrogen disappears.

<text>Evan Solomon (born April 20, 1968) is a Canadian columnist, political journalist, radio host, and publisher. Until 2022, he was the host of &quot;The Evan Solomon Show&quot; on Toronto-area talk radio station CFRB, and a writer for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. He was the host of CTV&#x27;s national political news programs &quot;Power Play&quot; and &quot;Question Period&quot;.

In October 2022, he moved to New York City to accept a position with the Eurasia Group as publisher of GZERO Media. Solomon continues with CTV News as a &quot;special correspondent&quot; reporting on Canadian politics and global affairs.&quot;

== Life and career ==
Solomon was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Virginia, an urban planner, and Carl Solomon, a lawyer. He graduated from high school at Crescent School in Toronto, Ontario. He then graduated from McGill University in English literature and religious studies.

In 1992, Solomon co-founded &quot;Shift&quot; with Andrew Heintzman. Originally an arts and culture magazine, &quot;Shift&quot; evolved to focus particularly on technology and Internet culture. Solomon left the magazine in 1999 to promote his first novel, &quot;Crossing the Distance&quot;. Solomon has also worked as a broadcaster, hosting the series &quot;The Changemakers&quot;, &quot;FutureWorld&quot; and &quot;Hot Type&quot; for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 2004, Solomon worked as co-editor, with Heintzman, on &quot;Fueling the Future: How the Battle Over Energy is Changing Everything&quot;. He was the co-anchor with Carole MacNeil of &quot;CBC News: Sunday&quot; and &quot;CBC News: Sunday Night&quot; from 2004 to 2009.

In 2009, Solomon was chosen to host the political discussion show &quot;Power &amp; Politics&quot; on CBC News Network and CBC Radio One&#x27;s weekly political affairs series &quot;The House&quot;.

On June 9, 2015, Solomon was fired from CBC after the Toronto Star reported that he allegedly took secret commissions for brokering art sales of items owned by his friend and art collector Bruce Bailey to people he was connected to through his CBC position. It was reported that Solomon pocketed $300,000 from commissions from these sales.

In August 2015, Sirius XM Canada announced that it had hired Solomon to host a political talk show, &quot;Everything Is Political&quot;, on its Canada Talks channel during the 2015 election. Solomon also wrote a column for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine for the duration of the election campaign.

In 2016, Solomon announced that he was joining the Ottawa-area talk radio station CFRA.

From 2016 to 2022, he was the host of CTV&#x27;s political affairs program &quot;Question Period&quot; and was also a substitute anchor for &quot;CTV National News&quot;.

In September 2017, Solomon joined CFRB in Toronto for a new national talk radio program, &quot;The Evan Solomon Show&quot;, that aired on Bell Media radio stations nationally until Solomon&#x27;s departure in October 2022.

In 2022, Solomon joined GZERO Media as publisher. The global affairs news site is a subsidiary of political risk analysis firm Eurasia Group, founded and run by renowned geopolitical scientist and author Ian Bremmer. 

Solomon continues to serve as a political and global affairs correspondent for CTV. 

== Personal life ==
Solomon is married to Tammy Quinn. The couple have two children.

<text>Fireflash was the United Kingdom&#x27;s first air-to-air guided missile to see service with the Royal Air Force. Constructed by Fairey Aviation, the missile utilised radar beam riding guidance. Fireflash had relatively limited performance and required the launching aircraft to approach the target from a limited angle astern.

The approximately 300 production Fireflash missiles were mostly expended as a training weapon to familiarize RAF pilots with missile firing. It was declared operational very briefly in 1957, thus becoming the RAF&#x27;s first operational air-to-air missile, but was quickly replaced by the de Havilland Firestreak the next year.

==Development==
===Red Hawk===
In January 1945 the Air Ministry issued Operational Requirement OR.1056, given the Ministry of Supply rainbow code &quot;Red Hawk&quot;, for an air-to-air missile. The basic design was based on studies carried out at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) on earlier weapons. Their experiments with the manually-guided Air Spaniel concept had convinced them that automatic guidance of some sort was required. This led to Artemis semi-active radar homing system, and the larger Little Ben which used beam riding. OR.1056 was overall similar to Little Ben, using beam riding along the AI Mk. IX radar signal as the illumination source.

In 1947, the various ongoing guided weapon projects in the UK were centralized at the RAE. In the immediately following period, a rationalized development program was laid out that called for the development of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) for the Royal Navy that became Seaslug, a similar SAM design for the British Army and Royal Air Force known by the code name &quot;Red Heathen&quot;, the Blue Boar anti-shipping bomb, and ongoing development of Red Hawk.

The initial development contract for Red Hawk was released to Gloster Aircraft in October 1947. They developed what was essentially a drone aircraft resembling a small swept-wing fighter, which would be carried in a recessed bay under the aircraft and lowered into the airstream before launch. The RAE was unimpressed, and in late 1947 developed their own design. This called for a smaller weapon using four RP-3 motors for boost which were then ejected, leaving the central projectile to coast onward to the target.

===Pink Hawk and Blue Sky===
It was soon realized that the all-aspect capability of Red Hawk was beyond the state of the art and a simpler weapon would be needed in the interim. In 1949, the RAE developed a watered-down specification they called &quot;Pink Hawk&quot; that called for a tail-chase attack and was intended to target piston-engined bombers. The Pink Hawk nickname was soon replaced with the official rainbow code, &quot;Blue Sky&quot;. The Red Hawk project continued as well, but only briefly before its specifications were relaxed as well; in November 1951 the Air Staff issued OR.1117, given the code &quot;Blue Jay&quot;, for an infrared seeking design which became Firestreak.

Fairey Aviation won the contract to develop Blue Sky, which they referred to internally as Project 5. Like the original Little Ben, Project 5 called for a beam riding missile able to be launched from the rear aspect within a 15° cone. Wartime German research suggested that the rocket exhaust would ionize the air behind the missile and make it difficult to receive the radar signal, so Fairey based their design on the original Red Hawk layout using separate boosters that fell away during flight, leaving the signal clear while the unpowered &quot;dart&quot; continued on to the target. In place of the original four RP-3 rockets, two custom-designed &quot;Stork&quot; rockets were used. The two solid-fuel motors were connected to the dart about mid-way along the fuselage. The rocket nozzles were canted slightly to spin the missile assembly on launch, evening out any asymmetries in the thrust. When the boosters are empty, a small cordite charge separates them, leaving the dart to carry on towards the target.

Development of Blue Sky was aided by ongoing projects at Fairey in rocket propulsion that were being used to support the development of the Fairey Delta 2 supersonic aircraft. This involved launching scale models of the proposed design using a locally designed liquid-fuel rocket engine, Beta 2. This also required the development of a complex multi-channel telemetry system that proved invaluable during the development of Blue Sky.

===Testing and service===
Fireflash was given its name by the RAF as development continued. It scored its first live-fire success in 1953, successfully destroying a Fairey Firefly drone aircraft flying off RAF Aberporth. In unarmed tests, Fireflash directly hit the drone aircraft, in one case severing its tailwheel.

About 300 missiles had been produced by 1955, but the Royal Air Force soon decided not to retain the type in its inventory as much more advanced designs were on their way. Many of the 300 missiles were expended in testing by No. 6 Joint Services Trials Unit at RAF Valley and Woomera, South Australia from 1955–1957 using Gloster Meteor NF11 (nightfighter) trials aircraft and subsequently by the Supermarine Swift fighters of No. 1 Guided Weapons Development Squadron at RAF Valley.

Fireflash was deployed on a very limited scale by the RAF in August 1957, and &quot;had a limited capability against piston-engine bombers.&quot; The RAF deployed the later and more effective de Havilland Firestreak infra-red missile from August 1958.

==Description==

The Fireflash was a beam riding missile - it was designed to fly down a radio beam emitted by the launch aircraft, which the pilot would keep aimed at the target.

It had a very unusual configuration: the missile body was unpowered. It was propelled by a pair of rocket boosters on the forward fuselage that were jettisoned 1.5 seconds after launch. The missile body, now travelling at around Mach 2, would coast the remaining distance to its target under guidance from the launch aircraft (the missile was unguided during the boost phase). The rocket engine nozzles were slightly offset to rotate the missile - this increased accuracy by evening out the effect of any slight asymmetry in thrust.

This configuration drastically limited both range and flight duration, but was used because of fears that ionised particles in the hot, rocket motor exhaust stream would interfere with the guidance radar signals; further development showed the fears were unfounded.

Steering was accomplished by four rudders in a cruciform configuration. These were moved by four pairs of pneumatic servos, operated by solenoid valves. An air bottle, pressurized to , supplied air for the servos and also supplied the air that spun the three, air-blown gyroscopes in the missile&#x27;s inertial navigation system. A high pressure air supply from the aircraft was also required to spin the gyros before the missile was launched.

The purpose of the control system was to keep the missile centred in the guidance beam emitted by the launch aircraft. The pilot of the aircraft would keep the beam aligned with the target using his gunsight, which was harmonized with the axis of the radio beam. An advantage of this system was that it would be unaffected by the target aircraft using radar countermeasures such as chaff. The missile&#x27;s receiver, fitted at the rear, only detected signals from the launch aircraft.

<doc id="972038" wikidata="Q127054" url="?curid=972038" title="De Havilland Firestreak">
<text>The de Havilland Firestreak is a British first-generation, passive infrared homing (heat seeking) air-to-air missile. It was developed by de Havilland Propellers (later Hawker Siddeley) in the early 1950s, entering service in 1957. It was the first such weapon to enter active service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm, equipping the English Electric Lightning, de Havilland Sea Vixen and Gloster Javelin. It was a rear-aspect, fire and forget pursuit weapon, with a field of attack of 20 degrees either side of the target.

Developed under the rainbow code &quot;Blue Jay&quot;, Firestreak was the third heat-seeking missile to enter service, after the US AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder, both of which entered service the previous year. In comparison to those designs, the Firestreak was larger and almost twice as heavy, carrying a much larger warhead. It had otherwise similar performance in terms of speed and range. It was also a very complex system, with an unusual internal design, requiring the launch aircraft to provide both cooling for its valve-based electronics and heating to prevent various moving parts from freezing prior to launch.

An improved version, &quot;Blue Vesta&quot;, was developed as part of the Operational Requirement F.155 project but ended when that project was canceled in 1957. Development restarted as a somewhat simpler version for the Lightning which was given the name &quot;Red Top&quot;. This featured transistorized electronics and greatly simplified internal design. Keeping its code name, it entered service on Lightning and Sea Vixen as the Hawker Siddeley Red Top. Red Top could not be carried on early versions of the Lightning, and so Firestreak remained in service until 1988, when the last RAF Lightnings retired.

==Development==
===Red Hawk===
Firestreak was the result of a series of projects begun with the OR.1056 Red Hawk missile, which called for an all-aspect seeker that could attack a target from any launch position. When this proved too ambitious for the state of the art, another specification lacking the all-aspect requirement was released as Blue Sky, which briefly entered service as Fireflash the year before Firestreak.

===Blue Jay===
In 1951 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), in charge of missile development, felt that infrared seeking had progressed to the point of reconsidering the Red Hawk requirement. This too turned out to be too demanding for the seekers of the era, although a more limited tail-aspect design was clearly possible in the short term. This led to another lower-performance specification that was released in 1951 as OR.1117, and given the Ministry of Supply rainbow codename Blue Jay.

Blue Jay developed as a fairly conventional-looking missile with cropped delta wings mounted just aft of the midpoint and small rectangular control surfaces in tandem towards the rear. Internally, things were considerably more complex. The tube-based electronics took up most of the forward quarter of the fuselage, leaving little room for a warhead. This led to the warhead being moved to the rear of the fuselage where it was wrapped around the rocket nozzle. That left no room for the actuators for the rear-mounted control fins, which were instead operated by nose-mounted actuators via long pushrods. The actuators were powered by compressed air from bottles at the extreme rear, fed forward through long pipes. The air bottles also powered a turbo-alternator for electrical power after launch. In the case of a miss, the missile self-destructed when the alternator slowed down after the air ran out.

The Magpie rocket motor took up only a small portion of the missile fuselage, placed between the actuators and the warhead, roughly centred under the mid-mounted wings. It consisted of of cordite that burned for 1.9 seconds, exiting the rear of the missile via a long tailpipe running through the rear section of the missile.

The lead telluride (PbTe) IR seeker was mounted under an eight-faceted conical arsenic trisulphide &quot;pencil&quot; nose and was cooled to to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The unusual faceted nose was chosen when a more conventional hemispherical nose proved prone to ice accretion. The seeker was cooled by running filtered air through an ammonia-cooled heat exchanger.

There were two rows of triangular windows in bands around the forward fuselage, behind which sat the optical proximity fuzes for the warhead. The prodigious warhead had a lethal radius and was triggered either by the proximity fuzes or four contact fuses set on the front of the wings. The outer casing of the warhead was designed to fragment into pieces fired forward in a 50 degree cone.

The electronics, made from vacuum tubes, generated significant heat. For this reason, the Firestreak missile undergoing a ground test was cooled by Arcton, and in-flight by ammonia pumped through the missile from bottles in the rear of the launching &quot;shoe&quot;. The bottles contained enough ammonia for 15 minutes, so the missile could only be started up during the approach. An air bottle in the fuselage-mounted weapon pack kept the ammonia bottles pressurized before launch. Hot air from the engine compressor stages connected to the rear of the launch pack and was routed to the missiles. During flight, this kept various moving components warm, warm enough that they would not freeze up during the 13 second flight time.

==Service==
The first airborne launch of Blue Jay took place in 1954 from a de Havilland Venom, the target drone - a Fairey Firefly - being destroyed. Blue Jay Mk.1 entered service in 1957 with the RAF, where it was named Firestreak. Firestreak was deployed by the Royal Navy and the RAF in August 1958; it was the first effective British air-to-air missile.

For launch, the missile seeker was slaved to the launch aircraft&#x27;s radar (Ferranti AIRPASS in the Lightning and GEC AI.18 in the Sea Vixen) until lock was achieved and the weapon was launched, leaving the interceptor free to acquire another target. A downside was that the missile was highly toxic (due to either the &quot;Magpie&quot; rocket motor or the ammonia coolant) and RAF armourers had to wear some form of CRBN protection to safely mount the missile onto an aircraft. &quot;Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, ... Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.&quot;

==Improvements==
Two minor Blue Jay variants were studied but not adopted. The Blue Jay Mk.2 included the more powerful Magpie II motor and a PbTe seeker which offered better detection capabilities. Blue Jay Mk.3 had an increased wingspan and reduced performance motor. The derated motor was intended to limit acceleration when launched from supersonic rocket-powered interceptors such as the Saunders-Roe SR.177 and Avro 720, where the additional speed imparted by the Magpie II would have given it a maximum speed so high it would suffer from adverse aerodynamic heating.

Looking for an improved weapon for the Operational Requirement F.155 interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk.4, which was later given its own rainbow code, Blue Vesta. This adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk.2, further improved by cooling it to improve its sensitivity in what became known as the &quot;Violet Banner&quot; seeker. The motor was further upgraded to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as &quot;mach tips&quot;. Work on Mk.4 was curtailed after 1956 as the RAE decided that the closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so rapid that the missile would have no chance to be launched while still within the range of its seeker.

In August 1956, the Fleet Air Arm took over development of the Blue Jay line with Blue Jay Mk.5, replacing the IR seeker with a semi-active radar homing (SARH) system intended to be used with the De Havilland Sea Vixen&#x27;s AI.18 radar with a special continual wave illuminator mode. This was otherwise identical to Mk.4, differing only by replacing its seeker section with a longer ogive nose cone holding the radar receiver antenna. Problems fitting the illuminator antenna to the Sea Vixen ended work on this project. In November 1957 it was briefly restarted under the name Blue Dolphin as other radar-guided developments ended, but this was never deployed.

==Red Top==

After the fallout of the 1957 Defence White Paper led to the cancellation of the F.155 and many other aircraft and missile projects, the English Electric Lightning was allowed to continue largely because development was almost complete. This left it with no modern weapon, so Blue Vesta was reactivated in a slightly modified form. In November 1957, paperwork with the Blue Vesta name on it was considered disclosed and the project was assigned the new name &quot;Red Top&quot;.

In contrast to the Mk.4 there were several important changes. The adoption of transistorized circuits in place of the former thermionic valves eliminated the need for cooling the electronics, as well as making the guidance section significantly smaller. This allowed the warhead to be moved from its former position near the tail to the midsection, which also allowed it to grow in size and weight, replacing the former blast-fragmentation type with an expanding-rod system that was significantly deadlier. The rear section of the missile was now left empty, allowing the fin actuators to be moved there, removing the complex routing. This still left more room that was used up by replacing the Magpie III with the new Linnet, which offered significantly higher performance and boosted the typical top speed of the missile from Mach 2.4 to 3.2 whilst almost doubling effective range to .

Given the elimination of the ammonia cooling, which was also used by the Violet Banner seeker of the Mk.4, the decision was made to use a simplified seeker that did not require cooling to the same level. This led to a new indium antimonide (InSb) design that was cooled with purified air at filtered to 3 μm. This reduced its sensitivity compared to Violet Banner, lacking its true all-aspect ability, but further simplified the design and eliminated ground handling concerns.

Never given its own name by the RAF, the new design entered service in 1964 as Red Top. It was faster and had a longer range than Firestreak, and &quot;was capable of all aspect homing against super-sonic targets.&quot; Despite Red Top being intended to replace Firestreak, Firestreak remained in limited service until the final retirement of the Lightning in 1988; carrying Red Top required more vertical tail to stabilize the effects of the missile&#x27;s larger wings, so Firestreak remained in use on older models of the Lightning.

<text>Patrick Allan Torpey (December 13, 1953 – February 7, 2018) was an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock band Mr. Big, as well as playing for other various singers and artists such as John Parr, Belinda Carlisle, Robert Plant, Montrose, Richie Kotzen and the Knack. Torpey also recorded with Impellitteri and Ted Nugent.

==Early years==
Torpey was born in Painesville, Ohio, on December 13, 1953. He first became interested in drumming as a child after seeing a drummer in a polka band performing at a local picnic.

In high school, Torpey immersed himself in all available music programs, including concert, orchestra, marching and stage bands. About his teenage years, he said: &quot;I wanted to play everything percussion, and I convinced my mother to buy me a used drum kit for my thirteenth birthday.&quot; His family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where he began to hone his skills by playing in various local bands.

==Career==
===Beginnings: 1983–1988===
In 1983, Torpey moved to Los Angeles. He recounts the beginning of his career: &quot;I&#x27;m a pretty good softball player and joined an entertainment league, and through that, I was able to make some new friends and network my way into a couple of gigs. I became a regular on the &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Solid Gold&quot; TV shows performing with Ben E. King, Mike + The Mechanics, Melissa Manchester, Bob Geldof, and a few I can&#x27;t even remember.&quot;

In 1985, Torpey successfully auditioned for the British pop-rock singer John Parr, who at the time had a #1 hit song, &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, and had attained the opening slot for Tina Turner on her Private Dancer tour. When that tour ended he became the drummer for Belinda Carlisle on her first solo tour, opening for Robert Palmer.

Torpey further explains: &quot;In 1987, I was doing a television show with Roger Daltrey and Bobby Colomby from Blood, Sweat and Tears approached me and asked me if I was available to do some studio work. Colomby was producing a couple of tracks for the Knack, and their original drummer had just left the band. I loved their music and what great fun for a drummer. They asked me to join the band.&quot;

===Mr. Big: 1988–2002, 2009–2018===

====Rise to fame====
While on tour with the Knack, Torpey was noticed by Billy Sheehan and Paul Gilbert, who were looking for a drummer for a new band. &quot;I loved playing with the Knack but when Billy approached me I jumped at the chance.&quot;

Mr. Big secured a recording contract with Atlantic Records but before the band started work on the first CD, Torpey was tapped to play drums with Robert Plant on his &quot;Now and Zen&quot; tour when Plant&#x27;s drummer Chris Blackwell was injured. &quot;Led Zeppelin was such a huge influence and the guys in Mr. Big knew what a fantastic opportunity it was and they gave me their blessing. &#x27;Communication Breakdown&#x27; every night, what a rush!!!&quot;

Mr. Big band was initially successful in Japan, but achieved international stardom with the 1991 release of their second studio album &quot;Lean into It&quot;. This album featured the acoustic ballad &quot;To Be with You&quot; which received strong play on radio stations and MTV, rising to #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. For fourteen years Mr. Big toured the world, headlining as well as opening for Aerosmith, Rush, Bryan Adams, the Scorpions and others, garnering a reputation for their musicianship and live performances.

====Reunion====
In January 2009, Torpey reunited with his old Mr. Big bandmates Eric Martin, Paul Gilbert and Billy Sheehan for a reunion tour. In 2010, they recorded and released the album &quot;What If...&quot; with producer Kevin Shirley. 2011 saw them back together for a world tour supporting the new album.

He continued to tour and record with the band through two more albums, &quot;...The Stories We Could Tell&quot; (2014) and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; (2017). Although health problems (specifically Parkinson&#x27;s disease) hampered his involvement in later days, he remained very much a part of the band up through his death in 2018.

===Solo work and other projects: 2002–2018===

Torpey had been noted as an accomplished backing vocalist with an extensive vocal range, often singing cover songs in the Mr. Big show during his encore, including singing Beatles songs during his drum solo. Due to Mr. Big&#x27;s popularity in Japan and Asia, Torpey released two solo albums for the Japanese market in collaboration with Lanny Cordola and Chuck Wright, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out: Y2K&quot;. Several tracks from these albums were reworked from Cordola and Wright&#x27;s previous band Chaos Is The Poetry.

Torpey played for the reformed version of Montrose; the &quot;new&quot; band stepped up for a memorable debut performance at the Los Angeles Key Club on April 29, 2002, in honour of Ozzy Osbourne and Mötley Crüe drummer Randy Castillo.

In 2004, he toured with Richie Kotzen as a drummer for his UK club tour and South American leg; he also played with Billy Sheehan on Johnny Hiland&#x27;s first self-titled album, &quot;Johnny Hiland&quot;. Torpey returned to the Knack in the same year.

At the end of 2006, Torpey joined &quot;The Exile Social Club&quot;, a band that relives old rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll hits and includes Chuck Wright from Quiet Riot, Jason Hook, and David Victor.

Torpey had been involved in live performances at clinics for Tama Drums in Japan, Russia, China, Indonesia, Philippines and many other parts of the world. Torpey has two instructional videos, &quot;Big Drums&quot; (performing several Mr. Big songs with Billy Sheehan) and &quot;Rock Groove Drumming&quot;, showing his approach to paradiddles, grace notes, heel-toe technique, and very fast triplets and double strokes with feet. Both provide insight into his drum parts on Mr. Big songs (&quot;Addicted to That Rush&quot;, &quot;Temperamental&quot;, &quot;Mr. Gone&quot;, &quot;Take Cover&quot; and &quot;Colorado Bulldog&quot;).

==Parkinson&#x27;s disease diagnosis and death==
He announced on July 25, 2014, that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and would be unable to perform all of his normal drumming duties on the band&#x27;s 2014–15 world tour in support of the album &quot;...The Stories We Could Tell&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;ve been dealing with Parkinson&#x27;s symptoms for the past couple of years and only recently received a confirmed diagnosis as symptoms worsened,&quot; Torpey said. &quot;I intend to fight the disease with the same intensity and tenacity that I drum and live my life by and will continue recording and performing, as always, to the best of my ability.&quot;

Torpey acted as a &quot;drum producer&quot; on Mr. Big&#x27;s 2017 album, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, also contributing drums and percussion to some tracks on the record, and playing percussion on tour, though Matt Starr had mostly taken over lead drummer duties at that point.

Torpey died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 64 on February 7, 2018.

<doc id="972041" wikidata="Q7729724" url="?curid=972041" title="The Den (TV programme)">
<text>The Den was a long-running children&#x27;s television strand of Ireland&#x27;s public broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann. 

First broadcast on 29 September 1986 on primary terrestrial station RTÉ1, it moved to secondary service Network 2 two years later. 

Initially a continuity strand for weekday afternoon programmes, &quot;The Den&quot; later expanded during the late 1990s and the 2000s, until it became synonymous with RTÉ&#x27;s children&#x27;s output. 

At various times during its run, it was known as &quot;Dempsey&#x27;s Den&quot;, &quot;Den TV&quot; and &quot;Den2&quot;.

In mid-2010, RTÉ Television announced an overhaul of its children&#x27;s output with the launch of RTÉjr and TRTÉ (now &quot;RTÉ Kids&quot;). &quot;The Den&quot; aired for the last time on 19 September 2010. 

The &quot;Den&quot; name returned for six weeks from November 2020 on RTÉ1, reuniting members of the original cast in a Sunday-evening variety-show format, predominantly aimed at families living through the country&#x27;s ongoing Covid-19 lockdowns.

==Overview==
&quot;The Den&quot; is considered to have pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable viewing for children and young people during its ratings peak in the 1990s, often employing irreverent and occasionally satirical humour within its continuity links, including integrating current affairs and world events to ongoing storylines and character development.

It also reintroduced anthropomorphic puppet characters to Irish pop-culture, including Zig and Zag, Podge and Rodge, Soky the Sock Monster, and Dustin the Turkey. Zig and Zag later transferred to Channel 4; Podge and Rodge moved onto adult comedy programming on RTÉ (including their own talk show); while Dustin went on to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest, among other media appearances.

In later years, &quot;The Den&quot; took up much of Network 2&#x27;s daytime schedule, airing for over 11 hours each weekday and on weekend mornings. It also acquired a reputation for airing new episodes of imported shows before other television networks in Europe. There were no commercial breaks during shows on &quot;The Den&quot;, although there were commercial breaks between shows.

==Broadcast history==

Following on from the success of a Children&#x27;s BBC strand in the UK, RTÉ launched its own strand for children&#x27;s programming, &quot;Dempsey&#x27;s Den&quot;, on 29 September 1986. Initially it was a two-hour strand each weekday afternoon on RTÉ 1 featuring nearly all of the broadcaster&#x27;s youth output (the main exceptions being &quot;Bosco&quot; and &quot;Jo Maxi&quot;).

Taking a cue from CBBC&#x27;s &quot;Broom Cupboard&quot; format, &quot;Dempsey&#x27;s Den&quot; was broadcast live from a tiny, single-camera presentation studio at RTÉ Television Centre, used mostly for in-vision continuity. Upon its move to Network 2 in September 1988, &quot;Dempsey&#x27;s Den&quot; gained an extra hour of airtime each weekday.

Ian Dempsey fronted the strand until the summer of 1990, although he continued to present the music feature &quot;Pop Goes the Den&quot; for a number of years. Ray D&#x27;Arcy took over &quot;The Den&quot; from 1990 to 1998, followed by Damien McCaul (1998-2003), Francis Boylan Jr (2003-2005) and Kathryn McKiernan (2005-2008).

===1986–1998===

The Den launched as &quot;Dempsey&#x27;s Den&quot; in 1986, with Irish radio personality Ian Dempsey acting as presenter. He was joined in 1987 by adolescent alien brothers Zig and Zag - hailing from the planet Zog, and recognisable by their &quot;zogabongs&quot;, spring-like antennae - who initially sought to &#x27;collect jokes&#x27;, and often utilised their roles and alternate personae on the show as a means of exploring human popular culture. The trio would later be joined by the brothers&#x27; extraterrestrial pet dog Zuppy, initially cast as a boisterous, mildly destructive counterfoil to Zag&#x27;s more gentle nature, and later becoming a non-verbal staple of the strand&#x27;s various incarnations.

They were joined by Dustin the Turkey-Vulture in December 1989, after Zag won Dustin in a golf tournament. Unaware that he was due to be slaughtered, cooked and consumed for that year&#x27;s Christmas dinner, Dustin won the Irish public&#x27;s affections with his inner-city Dublin accent and gregarious demeanour. Unable to bring themselves to kill the now-popular bird, the show&#x27;s crew accepted him as one of their number - although subsequent part-time employment as &#x27;a builder&#x27; became one of many running jokes, including the seemingly never-ending completion of off-screen neighbour Mrs. Murphy&#x27;s gate.

The &quot;Den&quot; format changed little over its first decade on air. It generally consisted of several cartoons in English and Irish, music videos, at least one RTÉ production, a daily birthday slot, and on certain days of the week, a viewers&#x27; quiz. Occasional features included location inserts, interviews and sketches. In September 1990, following Ian Dempsey&#x27;s departure, Ray D&#x27;Arcy became the presenter, and the programme was relaunched under the name &quot;The Den&quot;. 

Following her election as the first female President of Ireland in 1990, Mary Robinson made her first official media appearance in the role on &quot;The Den&quot;, being ushered into studio by show producers while waiting for an interview with RTÉ&#x27;s current-affairs department. This would foreshadow several storyline election campaigns by Dustin over the course of the decade - invariably running for the Fianna Fowl party - which in turn led to the character&#x27;s rise to infamy among Irish voters and political observers as a spoilt-vote candidate.

In September 1993, the strand&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Den TV&quot;.

The show&#x27;s studio set changed annually; a running joke reflecting the storyline &#x27;nuisance&#x27; status experienced by the Den crew within the state broadcaster&#x27;s internal hierarchy, and a subtle commentary on its funding of young people&#x27;s output. Locations included Number 10 Celebrity Square, in which Dustin set up a chip van for a period (1992-1993), a building site, a treehouse (1995-1996), a caravan (1996-1997), a smelly shed (1997-1998), a big bus (1998-1999), a hair salon called &quot;On The Noggin&quot; (1999-2000) and a spaceship. The presenter tended to sit behind a desk (or counter in the chip-van), with any puppets perched between the desk and the camera.

In September 1992, Zig and Zag joined Channel 4&#x27;s The Big Breakfast in the UK, eventually leaving The Den after the 1992-1993 season to spend more time appearing live on British and European television.

Shortly into the 1993-1994 season, Dustin neglected to do the washing for so long that smelly socks in the linen bin at the back of the set eventually came to life, in the form of Soky the Sock Monster. Initially making silent cameo appearances at the end of a broadcast day for eagle-eyed viewers, Soky was a gentle, child-like creature that immediately imprinted upon D&#x27;Arcy upon being discovered, referring to him thereafter as &#x27;Mammy Ray&#x27;. Popular among the strand&#x27;s very young viewers, Soky&#x27;s behaviour and humour often reflected the perspectives of a human toddler, including a fondness for comfort items, such as his blue bucket.

D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s last broadcast was on Friday 29 May 1998.

===1998–2005===
In September 1998, the Den was relaunched under the name &quot;Den 2&quot;, with Damien McCaul taking over as presenter. A morning show, &quot;Den AM,&quot; was presented by Geri Maye and Soky, beginning in 1998. A further strand aimed at older children, &quot;iD&quot;, aired from 5 pm to 7 pm. 

&quot;Den 2&quot; was broadcast continuously from morning to evening, but in-vision continuity was confined to the morning and afternoon strands. As &quot;Den 2&quot;, the programme launched a website in October 1999. In 2003, the strand gained its own daily news bulletin, &quot;news2day&quot;, similar in format to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsround&quot;.

The programme&#x27;s name reverted to &quot;The Den&quot; in 2002. Damien McCaul left the presenter&#x27;s role at the end of the 2002-2003 season and was replaced by Francis Boylan Jr in September 2003. Boylan remained as presenter until June 2005.

===2005–2010===
&quot;The Den&quot; was revamped again on 17 September 2005 with a new graphics package designed by Dunning Elley Joans (now Dunning Penny Joans). 

By now, the strand had been split into several daily shows, including &quot;Wakey Wakey&quot;, &quot;Den Tots&quot; and &quot;The Club&quot;, alongside the existing &quot;news2day&quot; bulletin at 5 pm. This final revamp removed much of the cast (bar Dustin, Soky, Charly and Zuppy), with Dustin moving to his own programme, &quot;Dustin&#x27;s Daily News&quot;. 

It also refocused the breakfast slot away from pre-school children and towards older viewers, with one continuity presenter, Kathryn McKiernan, fronting both morning and afternoon shows.

In September 2008, the separate shows were axed and in-vision presentation was replaced with out-of-vision announcements.

&quot;The Den&quot; ceased in September 2010 when RTÉ launched two new strands for its children&#x27;s output: RTÉjr and TRTÉ.

===2020===
Following a popular Comic Relief special reunion episode in June 2020, on 22 September 2020, RTÉ confirmed the return of &quot;The Den&quot; as a new weekend family show, reuniting Ray D&#x27;Arcy with Zig and Zag and Dustin the Turkey. 

The show returned to RTÉ One on 8 November 2020 and ran for six episodes including a Christmas Special, airing on Sunday evenings, the station&#x27;s long-established &#x27;appointment-viewing&#x27; slot.

===Special episodes===
* Christmas 1988: Dempsey&#x27;s Den Goes to Santaland: The first Christmas special. The gang travel to Santaland.
* Christmas 1991: Must Go to Moscow: The gang travel to Moscow.
* Christmas 1991: Turn On the Christmas lights at Dublin Airport: Ray D&#x27;Arcy, Zig and Zag travel to Dublin Airport to turn on the Christmas lights.
* October 1992: The Den Goes Disney: The gang travel to Euro Disney.
* Christmas 1992: Christmas Crisis: Podge breaks into Number 10 Celebrity Square, steals a gift of aftershave meant for Ray D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s mother and breaks D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s clock, and frames Zig. The episode culminates in a trip to Lapland to save Santa, who has been kidnapped by Podge.
* Christmas 1993: Together for Xmas: Zig and Zag return to the show on the occasion of a Swiss chocolate being made in Zag&#x27;s likeness. Zag has become self-obsessed since becoming a celebrity in the UK, and is led on a journey of self-realisation.

===Assistants===
During the Dempsey years, &quot;The Den&quot; assistant was Celine, who would later present &quot;Jo Maxi&quot; when D&#x27;Arcy departed that programme to succeed Ian Dempsey.

Ciara Carroll served as a regular assistant during D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s time as presenter. She would arrive at the studio to announce new competitions, provide observations from behind the camera and her laughter could often be heard in the background as Zig and Zag accused her of being responsible for breaking wind. She would also include herself during many other features throughout the day.

In its latter years, &quot;The Den&quot; remained on air during the summer, either using temporary cover presenters (Aidan Power, Aoibheann Garavaglia, etc.) or with no presenter-led continuity.

==Home-produced programming==
These included programming such as &quot;Echo Island&quot;, &quot;The Grip&quot; and &quot;The Works&quot;.

==Revivals==
On 27 October 2008, a compilation episode, &quot;Best Bitz From Back Den&quot;, was broadcast on RTÉ One. The episode featured clips dating back to Zig and Zag&#x27;s origins on &quot;The Den&quot;. It was compiled to celebrate the 21st anniversary of Zig and Zag. It was released on DVD a month later. Presenters D&#x27;Arcy and Dempsey featured heavily in the special. Other highlights included assaults perpetrated by Ted (a malicious panda) on the presenters, Christmas specials of &quot;The Den&quot;, footage of other characters such as Captain Joke, Captain Pillowcase and Cousin Nigel, and the 1989 Irish Film and Television awards at which Zig and Zag &quot;accidentally&quot; mistook then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds for actor Burt Reynolds and addressed him as &quot;your majesty&quot;.

On 14 November 2008, an edition of &quot;The Ray D&#x27;Arcy Show&quot; (then of Today FM) aired live from Vicar Street in Dublin, reflecting on the formative years of &quot;The Den&quot; from 1986 - 1994.

On 8 November 2009, a compilation episode, &quot;Dustin: 20 Years a Pluckin&quot;&#x27;, was broadcast on RTÉ One. It was also released on DVD. It was compiled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Dustin the Turkey.

The Den returned for a Comic Relief charity special on 26 June 2020.

<text>Russell Lee Rogers (April 12, 1928 – September 13, 1967), (Lt Col, USAF), was an American electrical engineer, U.S. Air Force officer, test pilot, and astronaut in the X-20 Dyna-Soar program.

==Early life and education==
Rogers was born on April 12, 1928, in Lawrence, Kansas. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Colorado in 1958. He was married with five children.

==Test pilot==
Rogers flew 142 missions as a fighter pilot during the Korean War. As a USAF Test Pilot School graduate, he was an experimental test pilot at Edwards AFB, California. During this assignment, Rogers served as a key member of the team that tested the Northrop T-38 Talon jet trainer. He was also a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. In April 1960, he was selected for the X-20 program. After several years supporting the Boeing-led program as a pilot consultant, Rogers left the X-20 program on December 10, 1963, when it was cancelled.

After the X-20 program, he remained in the U.S. Air Force on active flight duty as a pilot and was commander of the 12th Tactical Fighter Squadron with the rank of Lt. Colonel at the time of his death.

==Death==
Rogers was killed when the engine of his F-105 fighter plane failed near Kadena AFB, Okinawa, Japan on September 13, 1967. He ejected from his aircraft, but his parachute failed to deploy properly. He was 39 years old.

<doc id="972046" wikidata="Q534565" url="?curid=972046" title="Red Top (missile)">
<text>The Hawker Siddeley (later British Aerospace) Red Top was the third indigenous British air-to-air missile to enter service, following the de Havilland Firestreak and limited-service Fireflash. It was used to replace the Firestreak on the de Havilland Sea Vixen and later models of the English Electric Lightning.

Originally designed as an upgraded version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. In its primary role as an anti-bomber weapon fired at medium and high altitudes, it offered a significant improvement in overall performance.

Red Top was originally intended to replace Firestreak outright, but carrying the missiles on the Lightning required additional area to be added to the Lightning&#x27;s vertical stabilizer for stability at high speed. For this reason, Firestreak continued to be used on older models of the Lightning. Both missiles passed out of service in 1988 when the last of the Lightnings retired.

==Development==
===Improved Blue Jay===
Even before the original Firestreak entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its rainbow code &quot;Blue Jay&quot;, Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor known as Magpie II. Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched from new supersonic interceptors in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic friction. Neither project was proceeded with.

===Blue Vesta===
In late 1954, the Air Ministry received intelligence about new Soviet supersonic bomber designs. In January 1955 they issued Operational Requirement F.155 for a new interceptor aircraft capable of defeating these bombers, preferably at long range. Along with it was another requirement, OR.1131, for an all-aspect missile that would allow attacks from the front quarter and thus avoid having to chase the bombers as was required with the tail-aspect Blue Jay Mk. I. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, &quot;Blue Vesta&quot;.

Blue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II and further upgraded the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminium, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as &quot;mach tips&quot;.

Work on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) concluded that the closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so rapid that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger radar-guided Red Hebe, although some low-level work on Blue Vesta&#x27;s underlying technologies continued.

===Red Top===

F.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper, as Duncan Sandys noted that it would not be in service before new Soviet ballistic missiles had rendered the need for crewed interceptors moot. This argument was successfully countered by the Air Ministry, which pointed out that the Tupolev Tu-22 &quot;Blinder&quot; would be in service in 1962 resulting in a several-year gap where the RAF had no effective response.

It was decided to proceed with the development of the English Electric Lightning largely because it was already close to being complete. But even its Mach 2 speed would offer marginal performance over the Blinder and a tail-chase against this plane would be difficult to perform. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to provide an all-aspect weapon for Lightning and allow head-on attacks. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became &quot;Red Top&quot;.

Firestreak&#x27;s valve-powered electronics were replaced by transistorized versions, which were smaller and greatly improved reliability. More importantly, they no longer required active cooling, which in Firestreak had been accomplished with an aircraft-mounted system using ammonia, presenting a ground-handling safety issue. Removing the ammonia bottles and all of the plumbing for the cooling systems freed up room in the electronics section and the aircraft-mounted weapon pack.

Elimination of the cooling for the electronics also had the side-effect of removing the cooling for the seeker head, which had been used to improve its performance. A new cooling system using highly filtered air replaced the ammonia. For Red Top, the all-aspect lead telluride (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive indium antimonide (InSb) system known as &quot;Violet Banner&quot;. This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer general all-aspect capability; while it worked against supersonic targets warmed by skin friction, it would not work against subsonic targets and required a tail-aspect in these cases. This loss in performance was offset to some degree by increasing the field of view from 30 to 60 degrees, allowing the fighter much greater tactical freedom.

In contrast to Blue Vesta, which retained most of the original Firestreak physical layout, Red Top significantly rationalised the design. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail layout of the Firestreak. Previously the Magpie motor was in a bottle in the centre of the missile, and its exhaust reached the rear through a long tailpipe. The warhead was wrapped around the pipe, but that left too little room for the control fin actuators, which were instead controlled from nose-mounted actuators using long pushrods.

In Red Top, the smaller electronics package allowed the warhead to be moved forward, leaving room for the control actuators to be mounted directly on the fins and thus removing the need for the pushrods. Moving the actuators to the rear, along with the air bottle that powered them, still took up much less room than the warhead, allowing the rocket motor to be made larger by extending it rearward. This resulted in significantly higher performance than the original design.

With the warhead moved forward and the guidance electronics now taking up less room, the warhead was enlarged to 31 kg (68.3 lb) from Firestreak&#x27;s already prodigious 22.7 kg (50 lb). It also used an expanding-rod warhead in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. This move also left room at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR proximity fuse, which were formerly positioned just in front of the mid-mounted wings. This gave the missile an improved view of its targets. The new &quot;Green Garland&quot; fuse required smaller rectangular windows, compared to the Firestreak&#x27;s large triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.

The Red Top was much faster and had greater range and manoeuvrability than the Firestreak, and its infrared seeker enabled a wider range of engagement angles. &quot;Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.&quot;

===Almost cancelled===
Although Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, Sandys almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the Bloodhound Mk. II SAM entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for interceptor aircraft altogether. The Air Staff argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top&#x27;s head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.

At a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s de Havilland Sea Vixen. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement being less when launched from a supersonic Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on Blackburn Buccaneer, likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration combat air patrol.

Independently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of Hawker Aircraft also considered using Red Top on the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The concept fit the aircraft with a more powerful engine, added the AIRPASS radar from the Lightning, and carried a pair of Red Top missiles.

===Testing and service===


Red Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an English Electric Canberra beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.

The Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in 1964. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in 1988. Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace – Firestreak – also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top&#x27;s larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability at high speeds. Newer models of the Lightning were modified for Red Top, leaving Firestreak on the older models that were already in service.

===Further upgrades===
While the development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a semi-active radar homing version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became &quot;Blue Dolphin&quot;, but this was cancelled in 1958.

A longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a liquid fuel rocket running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.

===Phantom debate===
When plans began to introduce the McDonnell Douglas Phantom in UK service, the issue was raised about the inclusion of Red Top on that platform. It was agreed from the start that the primary weapon for this platform would be the AIM-7 Sparrow, but the choice of a secondary weapon was more contentious, with arguments being made for both Red Top or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. Those favouring the Red Top, mostly within the Ministry of Defence, pointed to its much higher performance against supersonic targets, especially in frontal engagements where it could be fired at ranges over under favourable conditions. It also had roughly double the maximum engagement angle, when radar cued, which gave the interceptor improved tactical freedom on their choice of approach.

In contrast, the Director of Surface and Amphibious Warfare (DSAW) noted several problems. Integrating the missile with the Phantom&#x27;s radar would require modifications to the aircraft and this was ruled out for budgetary reasons. This would mean that the missile would have to be locked on using its own seeker, which would greatly limit the angles that it could be fired at. In these situations, it had roughly the same firing angles as the Sidewinder. If radar cueing was added, then it would also suffer from the same problems that Sparrow would in terms of electronic countermeasures or a radar failure on the aircraft, which was the entire argument for including a secondary IR-based weapon. That being the case, the cost of Red Top, at £18,000 had little advantage over the Sidewinder, at £3,500 to £3,900. Additionally, Red Top was heavier, especially if one considered the mounting system, which would reduce the loiter time of the aircraft. Although some Red Top from the Sea Vixen fleet could be salvaged, the cost of buying additional missiles to fill out the larger fleet of Phantom aircraft would cost as much as simply buying a complete set of Sidewinder. These arguments won the day and the Phantom carried Sidewinder in service.

<text>Shift was a Canadian magazine, devoted to technology and culture. It has now ceased publication as a print magazine. Its website continued to publish new content for at least a year after the print title was discontinued, but is no longer in operation. The magazine was based in Toronto, Ontario.

==History and profile==
&quot;Shift&quot; was founded as a quarterly publication in 1992 by Evan Solomon and Andrew Heintzman. The first issue was published in July 1992. It was originally an arts and literary journal, but evolved into a technology magazine with a special focus on Internet culture in 1994. Articles by regular writer Clive Thompson focused on the culture and theory behind new media. In 1997 the magazine was acquired by Montreal-based company BHVR. Solomon left the magazine in 1999 to devote more time to his writing and broadcasting career.

In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the magazine attempted to expand its American presence in order to compete with similar magazines such as &quot;Wired&quot;. In 2000 the magazine was sold to its staff and the founder Andrew Heintzman again became the president of Shift Multimedia. Although magazine started its edition in the USA, it eventually ceased publishing. A short-lived television show inspired by the magazine was also unsuccessful.

<doc id="972055" wikidata="Q880346" url="?curid=972055" title="John Davis (Massachusetts governor)">
<text>John Davis (January 13, 1787 – April 19, 1854) was an American lawyer, businessman and politician from Massachusetts. He spent 25 years in public service, serving in both houses of the United States Congress and for three non-consecutive years as Governor of Massachusetts. Because of his reputation for personal integrity he was known as &quot;Honest John&quot; Davis.

Born in Northborough, Massachusetts, Davis attended Yale College before studying law in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he established a successful law practice. He spent 10 years (1824–34) in the United States House of Representatives as a National Republican (later Whig), where he supported protectionist tariff legislation. He won election as Governor of Massachusetts in a three-way race in 1833 that was decided by the state legislature. After two terms he was elected to the United States Senate, where he served most of one term, resigning early in 1841 after he was once again elected governor.

His second term as governor was undistinguished, but he split with fellow Whig Daniel Webster over a variety of issues, and lost the 1843 election to Democrat Marcus Morton. He was reelected to the Senate in 1845, where he served until 1851. He opposed the Mexican–American War, and worked to prevent the extension of slavery to the territories, although he did not take a hard line on the matter, voting for most of the provisions of the Compromise of 1850. He retired from public service in 1853, and died the next year.

==Early life==
John Davis was born in Northborough, Massachusetts to Deacon Isaac Davis and Anna (Brigham) Davis. He attended local schools and then Leicester Academy before attending Yale College. He graduated in 1812, and then studied law with Worcester lawyer Francis Blake, gaining admission to the bar three years later.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1821.

==Lawyer and Congressman==
Davis first practiced law in Spencer, Massachusetts, but soon returned to Worcester, where he eventually took over Blake&#x27;s practice. He was briefly in partnership with Levi Lincoln Jr. before the latter was appointed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1824. Davis also entered politics in 1824, winning election to the United States Congress. He represented Massachusetts from 1825 to 1833 in the House of Representatives in the 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd Congresses. He supported John Quincy Adams in his successful bid for the presidency, and favored conservative fiscal policies. In keeping with the state&#x27;s (and Worcester&#x27;s) increasingly industrial character, he favored protectionist tariff legislation; his speeches in support of the Tariff of 1828 were widely reprinted. He opposed the policies of President Andrew Jackson, and was politically aligned with Henry Clay, although he was against Clay&#x27;s proposed compromise tariff of 1833.

==Governor and Senator==
In 1833 Davis was encouraged by National Republican Party leaders to run for Governor of Massachusetts, against former President John Quincy Adams, who was running on the Anti-Masonic ticket, and Democrat Marcus Morton. His political support came from textile interests and a faction of the National Republicans (later Whigs) led by Abbott Lawrence, as well as outgoing Governor Levi Lincoln Jr. In the election Davis gained a plurality of votes, but not the majority that was then required. As a result, the state legislature decided the election, choosing Davis when Adams withdrew, preferring him over Morton. The Whig-controlled legislature did nothing to reward the Anti-Masons for Adams&#x27;s move, breaking up any chance that the two parties would form a working relationship. Davis was reelected in 1834, aided by a general dislike in Massachusetts for President Jackson&#x27;s attacks on the Second Bank of the United States. During these two terms, Davis made no particular initiatives of his own, continuing Lincoln&#x27;s business-friendly fiscal and economic policies. The state continued to grow economically, expanding its transportation infrastructure and industry.

Senator Nathaniel Silsbee, whose term ended in 1835, decided not to run for reelection. Davis was approached by Whig leader Daniel Webster about running for the seat in December 1834, as part of a bid to oppose Adams, who had announced his interest in the seat. The idea was that Davis, a strong candidate, would be positioned against Adams (a long-standing rival of Webster who was again running as an Anti-Mason) in the vote, which would be made by the state legislature, while Edward Everett would have the opportunity to run for governor when Davis vacated that seat. The state house and senate deadlocked on the two choices until a speech by Adams in Congress arguing in favor of Jackson&#x27;s foreign policies alarmed enough senators to change their votes in favor of Davis. The deadlock was not resolved until February 1835; Davis, who had been reelected governor, resigned that post to assume the Senate seat. Everett went on to win the governor&#x27;s seat in the next election. (Adams&#x27;s son Charles Francis believed that Webster and Everett conspired to achieve this end, but there is no evidentiary support for the idea.) Webster, in exchange for his advocacy on behalf of Davis, expected Davis&#x27;s faction in the Whig Party to support him in a future bid for the presidency.
Davis&#x27;s term in the Senate was unexceptional, except for the notably hard line he took on the question of the nation&#x27;s northeastern boundary. This dispute with the United Kingdom concerned the boundary between Maine and the British (now Canadian) province of New Brunswick, and had only been partially resolved after the 1794 Jay Treaty. In the 1830s both sides pushed development into the disputed area, leading to petty conflicts (and by 1839 the possibility of war). Massachusetts, which Maine had been a part of prior to 1820, maintained a property interest in some of the disputed land; Davis took a hard line on the matter, insisting that the United States should not surrender any of the territory it claimed.

In 1836 Davis sat on a special committee formed to consider legislative responses to a flood of allegedly inflammatory abolitionist materials being sent into southern slave states from northern anti-slavery organizations. Davis, the only northerner on the committee, opposed any sort of legislation, and the committee was unable to reach a consensus. When John C. Calhoun introduced legislation criminalizing the mailing of such materials, Davis spoke out against it, pointing out that it would effectively act as an unconstitutional gag on people seeking to speak out against slavery. The bill was rendered moot by administrative actions in the United States Post Office.

While serving in the Senate, Davis appeared before the United States Supreme Court in 1837, representing the defendants in &quot;Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge&quot;. The plaintiffs were proprietors of the Charles River Bridge, a toll bridge constructed between Boston and Charlestown in 1786, and the defendants were proprietors of a competing bridge to which the state had issued a charter in 1828. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant&#x27;s charter infringed on their charter, in which they claimed the state granted them an exclusive right to control the crossing. Davis and cocounsel Simon Greenleaf argued that the rights granted to the Charles River proprietors had to be interpreted narrowly, and that the state had not granted them an exclusive right. The court found for the defendants, with Chief Justice Roger B. Taney&#x27;s decision echoing the defendant&#x27;s reasoning. The Charles River Bridge charter would be acquired by the state in 1841, during Davis&#x27;s next term as governor.

During the early years of his political career Davis was on good terms with Daniel Webster, who was highly influential in party politics both at the state and national levels, and to whom he looked up. However, in the late 1830s Davis and other Massachusetts Whigs (notably Abbott Lawrence) came to believe that Webster lacked broad-based national support to successfully contend with Henry Clay and William Henry Harrison after his weak showing in the 1836 Whig convention. This introduced a rift between Webster and Davis that deepened in 1838 when the two split on western land policies. The split between Davis and Webster became permanent after Webster harshly criticized Lawrence in an 1842 speech celebrating his successful negotiation of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty with Great Britain, which resolved (among other matters) the northeast boundary.

==Governor and Senator, again==

Not long after Marcus Morton won the 1839 gubernatorial election, Whig leadership prevailed on Davis to run again for governor. In the 1840 election Davis rode the coattails of Harrison&#x27;s landslide presidential victory into office. Harrison&#x27;s death in April 1841 reenergized the Democrats, who attacked Davis in that year&#x27;s election. They charged that protectionist tariffs he supported taxed the poor, and that his opposition to western land policies was hypocritical because he also speculated in those lands. Davis won a narrow majority over Morton, and was reelected in 1841. This period in office, like his first term as governor, also did not contain any new programs or initiatives, but was overshadowed by the ongoing negotiations between Daniel Webster (now Secretary of State) and Lord Ashburton over the boundary issue. Davis and Webster had contentious disagreements over the negotiations, although Webster was finally able to convince Davis to accept the final agreement. The matter deepened the division between the two men, who stopped speaking to each other.

In 1842 the anti-slavery Liberty Party had risen to sufficient prominence in the state that neither Morton nor Davis was able to secure a majority. The state senate, which had a Democratic majority, elected Morton. Davis&#x27;s showing in the election was undoubtedly harmed by his ongoing feud with Webster, who refused to campaign on his behalf.
Davis was considered as a potential vice presidential nominee in the 1844 Whig Party convention. He was nominated by the state Whig convention over Webster&#x27;s opposition, but Webster worked to ensure he was not chosen at the national convention. Webster forces successfully got Webster elected to the Senate in early 1845, despite opposition from the Lawrence-Davis faction. Davis was himself elected to the Senate again later in 1845 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Isaac C. Bates, and was elected to a full term in 1847. He opposed the annexation of Texas on the grounds that it would expand slaveholding territory, but was not willing to split the party over the issue of slavery. Davis was one of only two senators who voted against the Mexican–American War.

Davis was opposed to slavery and its extension into the territories, but he voted for most of the provisions of the Compromise of 1850, including the bill on Texas borders, shocking some anti-compromise Whigs. He regularly voted in favor of the Wilmot Proviso, a measure to ban slavery from territories won in the Mexican war which was frequently attached to legislation in the late 1840s but was never adopted. In one notable debate, Davis used procedural measures to delay vote on an amendment to remove it from a military appropriations bill, hoping to force a vote without time to conference on differences between the House and Senate versions before Congress adjourned. However, due to a difference in the clocks in the respective chambers, the House adjourned before he finished speaking, scuttling the bill. Salmon P. Chase wrote of the episode, &quot;Ten political lives of ten John Davises, spent in the best direction, could not compensate for this half-hour&#x27;s mischief&quot;, and Polk noted that if the loss of the bill delayed the end of the Mexican war, Davis would &quot;deserve the execrations of the country.&quot; Scholarship is divided on whether Davis&#x27;s claimed strategy would really have worked.

Davis&#x27;s weak stance on slavery began to cause a decrease in his popularity as abolitionist sentiment in the state gained ground during the 1840s. He also refused to support Webster in his 1852 presidential bid, campaigning on behalf of Winfield Scott. He declined renomination for election in 1852, and retired from public life.

In his later years Davis was associated with the American Antiquarian Society, where he served as president for many years. He died in Worcester on April 19, 1854, and was interred in the Worcester Rural Cemetery. He was known as &quot;Honest John&quot; Davis, because of an impeccable reputation for personal integrity.

==Personal life and business==
In 1844, Davis and his nephew Isaac were among the founders of the State Mutual Life Assurance Company of Worcester, one of only five life insurance companies in the country. Davis served as its president until his death, after which his nephew took over.

Davis married Eliza Bancroft in 1822. She was the daughter of Worcester minister Aaron Bancroft and sister to historian and statesman George Bancroft. They had five children, including diplomat John Chandler Bancroft Davis, general Hasbrouck Davis, and Congressman Horace Davis; their descendants include Assemblyman Gherardi Davis (1858–1941), physiologist Hallowell Davis, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. John Davis Long, the grandson of a cousin, and who was named in his honor, also served as Governor of Massachusetts

<text>Provost marshal is a title given to a person in charge of a group of Military Police (MP). The title originated with an older term for MPs, &quot;provosts&quot;, from the Old French (Modern French ). While a provost marshal is now usually a senior commissioned officer, they may be a person of any rank who commands any number of MPs; historically, the title was sometimes applied to civilian officials, especially under conditions of martial law, or when a military force had day-to-day responsibility for some or all aspects of civilian law enforcement (such as some British colonies). A provost marshal may also oversee security services, imprisonment, fire/emergency services and ambulances.

==British Armed Forces==
In the British Armed Forces, the provost marshal is the head of the military police of each service, with the senior military police officers at lower levels being titled deputy or assistant provost marshals. In many cases the provost marshal is in charge of discipline. Provost Marshal is the oldest extant appointment in the British Army. It dates back to early Tudor times but the office was probably in existence in the 12th century. By the end of the 17th Century each regiment had its own provost marshal under the Provost Marshal General. Currently, the provost marshal (army) is also the commander of the 1st Military Police Brigade.

==Canadian Armed Forces==
The Canadian Forces Provost Marshal (CFPM) is the branch advisor for the Canadian Forces Military Police Branch, and also the Commander of the Canadian Forces Military Police Group (CF MP Gp). The CFPM is headquartered in Ottawa and has five sections, each under the command of a Deputy Provost Marshal (DPM): DPM Police, DPM Resource Management, DPM Individual Training and Education, DPM Security, and DPM Professional Standards.

The CF MP Gp is composed of the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS), Military Police Security Services (MPSS), Canadian Forces Service Prison and Detention Barracks (CFSPDB), and Canadian Forces Military Police Academy (CFMPA).

==German Armed Forces==
The chief of the German Military Police (&quot;Feldjäger&quot;) is called (equivalent to provost marshal general). The German Armed Forces (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;) do not have a specific title for military police officers so in most tactical units and especially in multinational deployments, they will use the English term &quot;provost marshal&quot;.

==New Zealand Defence Force==
The provost marshal of the Joint Military Police Unit holds a senior commissioned rank. Currently a colonel holds the provost marshal position for the NZDF.

The provost marshal is responsible for all three military police units from the Navy, Army and Air Force.

==United States Armed Forces==
In the United States Army and United States Marine Corps (USMC), the senior-most military law enforcement officer is the Provost Marshal General (PMG) (Army) or provost marshal (USMC). The US Army PMG is a post that was reinstated in 2003, having been abolished 29 years earlier. The PMG is a general in charge of the United States Army Military Police Corps, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and United States Army Corrections Command (ACC) policy and procedures from the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG) at The Pentagon.

The senior MP officer at the theater, corps, division, and brigade level and for each garrison is known as a provost marshal. In many US Army garrisons, a provost marshal is at times also responsible for the provision of fire and physical security as well as law enforcement services and thus is also referred to as the Director of Emergency Services (DES).

==Other uses==
The British far-right group Britain First also use the rank, presumably as head of their paramilitary wing &#x27;Britain First Defence Force&#x27;, with provision for two &quot;provosts marshal&quot; in their official group constitution.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1988 film The Presidio, Sean Connery portrayed Lt. Colonel Alan Caldwell, the base provost marshal.

<doc id="972057" wikidata="Q711913" url="?curid=972057" title="Stanley Cortez">
<text>Stanley Cortez, A.S.C. (born Stanislaus Samuel Kranz; November 4, 1908 – December 23, 1997) was an American cinematographer. He worked on over 100 films between 1929 and 1980, and was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. His most notable credits included Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942), Charles Laughton&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955), Nunnally Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; (1957), and Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; (1964). He served as President of the American Society of Cinematographers from 1985 to 1986.

He was the younger brother of actor and director Ricardo Cortez.

==Biography==
Cortez was born under the surname &quot;Krantz&quot; in New York City and attended New York University. He adopted his professional name Cortez to capitalize on the fame of his older brother, Jacob Krantz, who had been transformed into the film matinee idol Ricardo Cortez. He first worked as a designer of elegant sets for several portrait photographers&#x27; studios (including that of Edward Steichen), which may have influenced his strong spatial awareness and ability to effectively use camera movement: a strong feeling for space and an ability to move his camera through that space in such a way as to embody it in film&#x27;s two-dimensional format. His first job in the film industry was for Pathé News, which later allowed him to give his films a newsreel-like touch when necessary. During the 1920s and the early 1930s, he worked his way up the usual Hollywood cameraman ladder: camera assistant, camera operator, and cinematographer (or first cameraman, a rank he attained in 1936). He managed to work for some of the great Hollywood cameramen, among them Karl Struss, Charles Rosher, and Arthur C. Miller. On the side, Cortez managed to do an experimental film, &quot;Scherzo&quot; (1932), that drew on the techniques of Slavko Vorkapić; the short has been described as a &quot;symphony of light&quot; by some critics.&quot;

Cortez&#x27;s early films often involved unconventional subjects, providing opportunities for experimentation. He often employed experimental techniques to enhance the visual appeal of his films. In &quot;The Forgotten Woman&quot; (1939) he did an extreme close-up of the actress&#x27;s eyes to create a sense of seeing into her mind. Then Cortez had a big chance to work with Orson Welles on &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942). Cortez saw the set for the film before being appointed the first cameraman. His spatial sense told him that shooting the film within these sets would be a tremendous challenge. Cortez&#x27;s work on the film utilized his expertise in navigating studio space, a skill that was integral to its visual storytelling. Some of Cortez&#x27;s work on The Magnificent Ambersons was reportedly edited out during post-production. During World War II, Cortez served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

In his later years, Cortez filmed several psychological dramas. In &quot;Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman&quot; (1947), Cortez used flashing lights placed inside the camera to create a sense of drunkenness. Charles Laughton gave Cortez another challenge – &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;. The film has been widely praised for its innovative use of lighting and cinematography, and Cortez managed to endow the camera movements with a musical quality. In &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; (1957), Cortez found his actress: Joanne Woodward would be to him what Greta Garbo was to William H. Daniels and Marlene Dietrich to Lee Garmes. Cortez&#x27;s subtle modulations of lighting match Woodward&#x27;s equally subtle changes of expression, and both together create the sense of Eve, a psychologically split personality, becoming someone else. In Samuel Fuller&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;Shock Corridor&quot;, the labyrinthine hallways and rooms of the studio set are transformed by Cortez&#x27;s camera into a symbol of incarceration and insanity. Fuller used Cortez again on &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; and sought him for &quot;The Big Red One&quot; in 1978 but the producer Gene Corman said the low-budget film shot in Israel couldn&#x27;t afford him.

Cortez started &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974), but director Roman Polanski replaced him after a few days of shooting due to a disagreement over visual style. He was replaced by John Alonzo.

Cortez died in 1997 of a heart attack and is buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery.

<text>Hodge 301 is a star cluster in the Tarantula Nebula, visible from Earth&#x27;s Southern Hemisphere. The cluster and nebula lie about 168,000 light years away, in one of the Milky Way&#x27;s orbiting satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Hodge 301, along with the cluster R136, is one of two major star clusters situated in the Tarantula Nebula, a region which has seen intense bursts of star formation over the last few tens of millions of years. R136 is situated in the central regions of the nebula, while Hodge 301 is located about 150 light years away, to the north west as seen from Earth. Hodge 301 was formed early on in the current wave of star formation, with an age estimated at 20-25 million years old, some ten times older than R136.

Since Hodge 301 formed, it is estimated that at least 40 stars within it have exploded as supernovae, giving rise to violent gas motions within the surrounding nebula and emission of x-rays. This contrasts with the situation around R136, which is young enough that none of its stars have yet exploded as supernovae; instead, the stars of R136 are emitting fast stellar winds, which are colliding with the surrounding gases. The two clusters thus provide astronomers with a direct comparison between the impact of supernova explosions and stellar winds on surrounding gases.

<doc id="972071" wikidata="Q310918" url="?curid=972071" title="Henry IV of Castile">
<text>Henry IV of Castile (Castilian: &quot;Enrique IV&quot;; 5 January 1425 – 11 December 1474), nicknamed the Impotent, was King of Castile and León and the last of the weak late-medieval kings of Castile and León. During Henry&#x27;s reign, the nobles became more powerful and the nation became less centralised.

==Early life ==
Henry was born in 1425 at the Casa de las Aldabas (since destroyed) in Teresa Gil street of Valladolid. He was the son of John II of Castile and Maria of Aragon, daughter of King Ferdinand I of Aragon. He displaced his older sister, Eleanor, and became heir apparent to the Castilian throne as the Prince of Asturias.

At the time of his birth, Castile was under control of Álvaro de Luna, who intended to select Henry&#x27;s companions and direct his education. The companions of his own age included Juan Pacheco, who became his closest confidant. The struggles, reconciliations and intrigues for power among the aristocracy, Álvaro de Luna, and the Infantes of Aragon would be constant.

On 10 October 1444, he became the first and only prince of Jaén. In 1445 he won the First Battle of Olmedo, defeating the Infantes of Aragon. After the victory at Olmedo, Álvaro de Luna&#x27;s power waned, and Prince Henry and Juan Pacheco&#x27;s influence grew.

==Accession and rule==
Henry IV&#x27;s father died on 20 July 1454 and he was proclaimed king the following day.

One of King Henry&#x27;s first priorities was the alliance with Portugal. He achieved this by marrying a second time to Joan of Portugal, daughter of King Edward of Portugal, in 1455; and by meeting her brother King Afonso V of Portugal in Elvas in 1456. His other main concerns were the possibility of intervention from King John II of Navarre, establishing peace with France and Aragon, and pardoning various aristocrats. Henry IV convened the Cuéllar Courts to launch an offensive against the Emirate of Granada. The campaigns of 1455 and 1458 developed into a war of attrition based on punitive raids and avoiding pitched battles. It was not popular with the aristocracy or the people. Juan Pacheco, the Marquis of Villena, and his brother Pedro Girón were put in charge of government decisions. King Henry also took other advisors, such as Beltrán de la Cueva, Miguel Lucas de Iranzo, and Gómez de Cáceres to balance against their influence.

In 1458, King Alfonso V of Aragon died and was succeeded by his brother, John II of Navarre. King John II resumed his interference in Castillian politics, supporting the aristocratic opposition to Juan Pacheco&#x27;s ambitions. With the support of the King Henry, Pacheco moved to seize Álvaro de Luna&#x27;s assets, but his widow allied herself with the Mendoza family, causing a division among the aristocracy. This process resulted in the formation of a League of Nobles in March 1460. They raised a large number of noblemen, took control of expenditure, and gained the acceptance of Alfonso of Castile, the King Henry&#x27;s half-brother and Prince of Asturias.

To counteract King John II&#x27;s politicking, Henry IV reacted by invading Navarre in support of Charles, Prince of Viana. Charles was the heir to Navarre, and he revolted against his father John II in 1450 when he refused to cede the throne of Navarre. The campaign was a military success, but King Henry made peace with the League of Nobles in August 1461 to ward off the power of the Mendozas, which had allowed John II to intervene in Castile.

King John II was in conflict with the Principality of Catalonia, and on the death of his eldest son, Charles of Viana, the principality elected Henry IV to be Count of Barcelona on 11 August 1462. King Henry&#x27;s intervention was framed as a rivalry between him and John II, making Catalonia an unstable point in the Crown of Aragon. But he was unsuccessful, and the Castillian economy would suffer from an enmity with France, who had supported John II with the &quot;Treaty of Bayonne&quot;. Henry IV therefore agreed to a settlement in the &quot;Judgment of Bayonne&quot;, resulting in the abandonment of the Catalans.
During his reign as king, Henry IV spent a lot of time at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid where he would stay for long periods of time. The Royal Alcazar was later replaced with the Royal Palace of Madrid by the rulers of Spain.

==Marriages==
===Blanche II of Navarre===
Prince Henry celebrated his marriage to Blanche of Navarre in 1440, when he was 15 years old. The cardinal Juan de Cervantes presided over the official ceremony. Her parents were Blanche I of Navarre and John II of Navarre. The marriage had been agreed in 1436 as part of the peace negotiations between Castile and Navarre. The dowry included territories and villas that had previously belonged to Navarre but had been won by the Castillian side during the war, and the Castilians agreed to hand the lands back provided they would be given them back again as part of this dowry.

In May 1453, the bishop of Segovia Luis Vázquez de Acuña annulled the marriage of Henry and Blanche, on the grounds of Henry&#x27;s sexual impotence due to a curse. This neatly reflected the recent political changes: Castile had supported Charles, Prince of Viana in his fight against John II of Aragon for the Navarrese throne since 1451, and Álvaro de Luna, Duke of Trujillo had been executed in May 1453, leaving Henry with greater control of Castile. Henry alleged that he had been incapable of sexually consummating the marriage, despite having tried for over three years, the minimum period required by the church. Other women, prostitutes from Segovia, testified that they had had sexual relations with Henry, which is why he blamed his inability to consummate the marriage on a spell. Henry&#x27;s alleged &quot;permanent impotence&quot; only affected his relations with Blanche. Blanche and Henry were cousins, and he was also a cousin of Joan of Portugal, whom he wanted to marry instead. Therefore, the reason he used to seek the annulment was the sort of spell that only affected his ability to consummate this one marriage, and would not cause any problems for him with other women. Pope Nicholas V corroborated the decision in December of the same year in a papal bull and provided a papal dispensation for Henry&#x27;s new marriage with the sister of the Portuguese king.

One of Henry&#x27;s detractors, the historian Alfonso de Palencia, wrote that the marriage had been a sham and accused Henry of despising his wife and planning to commit adultery to bear children. According to Palencia, Henry demonstrated &quot;most extreme abhorrence&quot; to his wife, and indifference to the confines of marriage. However, in 1462 Blanche gave up her right to the Navarrese throne so Henry could take it, and selected him as her protector, against her own father John II of Aragon.

===Joan of Portugal===
The remoteness of Aragon led to an approach to Portugal. In March 1453, before his divorce from Blanche was finalised, there was no record of negotiations for the new marriage between Henry and Joan of Portugal, sister of the king Afonso V of Portugal. The first marital approaches were made in December of that year, although the negotiations were long and the proposal wasn&#x27;t definitively agreed until February 1455. According to chroniclers of the time, Joan did not provide a dowry and would not have to return anything even if the marriage turned out to be a failure. The length of the negotiations and the concessions could be interpreted as caused by the concerns about the rumours of Henry&#x27;s impotence. The wedding was celebrated in May 1455, but without an affidavit of official bull authorizing the wedding between them, although they were first cousins (their mothers were sisters) and half second cousins (their paternal grandmothers were half-sisters). On 28 February 1462, the queen gave birth to a daughter Joanna la Beltraneja, whose paternity came into question during the conflict for succession to the Castillian throne when Henry died.

Henry IV was twenty-six years old when his half-sister Isabella was born. She was the daughter of his father&#x27;s second marriage in 1447, to Isabella of Portugal. Henry made a number of attempts throughout his reign to arrange a politically advantageous marriage for his much younger sister. The first attempt was when the six-year-old Isabella was betrothed to Ferdinand, son of John II of Navarre (a cadet branch of the House of Trastámara). This arrangement, however, did not last long.

==Civil war ==
Before the birth of his daughter, Henry convened the Court in Madrid and Joanna was sworn in as Princess of Asturias. But a conflict with the nobility was created when Beltrán de la Cueva deposed Juan Pacheco, the Marquis of Villena, and his brother Pedro Girón, Master of Calatrava from Henry&#x27;s court. This caused a change in alliances: Mendoza began to support the king, and Pacheco revived the Aristocratic League aimed at eliminating the influence of Beltrán de la Cueva. They had doubts about the paternity of Henry&#x27;s daughter, saying that she was in fact the daughter of the new favourite, and started referring to her as &quot;la Beltraneja&quot;. The league of nobles, controlling the king&#x27;s siblings Alfonso and Isabella, forced Henry at the 1464 Representation of Burgos to repudiate Joanna and recognize Alfonso as his official heir. Alfonso then became Prince of Asturias, a title previously held by Joanna. Henry agreed to the compromise with the stipulation that Alfonso someday marry Joanna, to ensure that they both would one day receive the crown.

Not long after this, Henry reneged on his promise and began to support his daughter&#x27;s claim once more. The nobles in league against him conducted a ceremonial deposition-in-effigy of Henry outside the city of Avila and crowned Alfonso as a rival king. This event is known in history as the Farce of Avila. Shortly thereafter, Alfonso began handing out land and titles as if he were already uncontested ruler. A civil war began. The most notable clash was at the Second Battle of Olmedo in 1467, which concluded as a draw.

==Death==

However, in 1468, at the age of only 14, Alfonso died, most likely from the plague (although poison and slit throat have been suggested). His will left his crown to his sister, Isabella, who was asked to take her brother&#x27;s place as the champion of the rebels. Shortly thereafter at the negotiation of Toros de Guisando, in which she and her allies received most of what they desired, Henry agreed to exclude Joanna la Beltraneja from the succession, and to recognize Isabella as his official heir. Though Henry continued to resist this decision when possible, his actions were ineffective, and he remained at peace with Isabella for the rest of his reign. Isabella became Castile&#x27;s next monarch when he died in 1474.

After the death of the king, war broke out in Castile. Joanna was supported by Portugal, while the eventual winner, Henry&#x27;s half-sister Isabella I of Castile, had the support of Aragon. France initially supported Joanna, yet in 1476, after losing the Battle of Toro, France refused to help Joanna further and in 1478 signed a peace treaty with Isabella.

==Debate over his health and sexuality ==

In 1440, at the age of fifteen, he was married to Blanche II of Navarre. The marriage was never consummated. In 1453, after thirteen years, Henry sought an annulment. An official examination confirmed the virginity of Blanche, and a priest questioned the prostitutes of Segovia, who confirmed that Henry was sexually capable. Blanche was sent home; eight years later, she became &quot;de jure&quot; Queen of Navarre and died under strange circumstances.

In 1455, Henry married Joan of Portugal, sister of Afonso V of Portugal. After six years of marriage, in 1462, she gave birth to a daughter, Joanna, nicknamed &quot;La Beltraneja&quot;. Six years after the birth of the throne&#x27;s heir, part of the nobility of Castile revolted against the king. The rebels claimed that the princess was not the daughter of the king, but actually the daughter of Beltrán de La Cueva, 1st Duke of Alburquerque (thus the nickname &quot;Beltraneja&quot;). This hypothesis was reinforced when the Queen had another two children with the nephew of a bishop. Though many contemporary historians and chroniclers believed Henry was impotent or homosexual, the royal chronicles of his reign were all written or revised during the reign (and under the influence) of Isabella I, his half-sister and ultimate successor, whose strong interest in proving Joanna illegitimate renders these accounts at least partially suspect, in addition to the fact that female prostitutes testified to having intercourse with Henry. The question of Joanna&#x27;s paternity and right to the throne is therefore not firmly answerable, given the lack of available reliable sources.

The doubt of her legitimacy as an heir, the weakness of the king, the adultery of the queen, and the unruliness of the nobility all set the stage for a struggle for succession after Henry&#x27;s death. Henry divorced his wife after her scandalous behavior with Bishop Fonseca&#x27;s nephew. After a long period of conflict between the rival factions, Henry finally agreed to name Isabella his successor, in Guisando (Ávila), provided she allow him to arrange her strategic marriage. Isabella would go on to break this stipulation of the agreement.

Henry died in 1474 and was buried at Santa María de Guadalupe, next to his mother.

== Appearance ==
Henry was a striking man. Tall, blonde and well built, he had broken his nose as a child. The accident left him with an adult face that made him look, depending on to whom one listened, like either a terrifying lion or a foolish monkey.

<doc id="972076" wikidata="Q3314544" url="?curid=972076" title="Milton Orville Thompson">
<text>Milton Orville Thompson (May 4, 1926 – August 6, 1993), (Lt Cmdr, USNR), better known as Milt Thompson, was an American naval officer, aviator, engineer, and NASA research pilot. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the United States Air Force and NASA.

Following his involvement with the X-15 program, Thompson became Chief Engineer and Director of Research Projects at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center.

==Early life and education==
Born in Crookston, Minnesota, on May 4, 1926, to parents Peter Thompson (1898–1960) and Alma Theresa Thompson (; 1898–1977). Thompson began flying with the U.S. Navy as a pilot trainee at age 19. He served in China and Japan during World War II.

Following six years of active Naval service, Thompson entered the University of Washington, in Seattle, Washington. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering in 1953. He remained in the Naval Reserve during college and continued flying, in Navy aircraft and in crop dusters and forest-spraying aircraft, eventually receiving the rank of lieutenant commander.

After graduating, Thompson became a flight test engineer for the Boeing Aircraft Company in Seattle. During his two years at Boeing, he flew on the sister aircraft of Dryden&#x27;s B-52B air-launch vehicle.

Thompson was married to Therese Beytebiere; they had one daughter named Brett and four sons.

Thompson&#x27;s parents were Peter Thompson and Alma T. Thompson; his siblings were Adeline, Fay and Janice.

==Test pilot==
Thompson was hired as an engineer at the flight research facility on March 19, 1956, when it was still under the auspices of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). He became a research pilot in January 1958.

On August 16, 1963, Thompson became the first person to fly a lifting body, the lightweight NASA M2-F1. The plywood and steel-tubing prototype was flown as a glider after being released from an R4D tow plane. He flew it a total of 47 times, and also made the first five flights of the all-metal Northrop M2-F2 lifting body, beginning July 12, 1966.

Lifting bodies were wingless vehicles designed to generate lift and aerodynamic stability from the shape of their bodies. They were flown at Dryden to study and validate the concept of safely maneuvering and landing a low lift-over-drag vehicle designed for reentry from space. Data from the program helped in the development of the Space Shuttle.

Thompson was also one of the 12 NASA, Air Force, and Navy pilots to fly the North American X-15 rocket-powered research aircraft between 1959 and 1968. He began flying X-15s on October 29, 1963, only 74 days after his first Lifting Body flight. He flew the aircraft 14 times during the following two years, reaching a maximum speed of 3,712 mph (Mach 5.48) and a peak altitude of 214,100 feet on separate flights.

The X-15 program provided a wealth of data on aerodynamics, thermodynamics, propulsion, flight controls, and the physiological aspects of high-speed, high-altitude flight.

Thompson was one of an elite group of eight pilots who tested the paraglider research vehicle NASA Paresev.

In 1962 the U.S. Air Force selected Thompson to be the only civilian test pilot to fly in the X-20 Dyna-Soar program that was intended to launch a human into Earth orbit and recover with a horizontal ground landing. The program was canceled before construction of the vehicle began.

==Administrator==
Thompson was also a member of NASA&#x27;s Space Transportation System Technology Steering Committee during the 1970s. In this role he led the effort to design the Orbiters for power-off landings rather than increase weight with air-breathing engines for airliner-type landings. His committee work earned him NASA&#x27;s highest award, the Distinguished Service Medal.

Thompson concluded his active flying career in 1967, becoming Chief of Research Projects two years later. In 1975 he was appointed Chief Engineer and retained the position until his death on August 6, 1993, at the age of 67. On the day of his death, Thompson was scheduled to be honored at a NASA dinner. The award dinner proceeded as a memorial to Thompson. The cause of Thompson&#x27;s death was not released, except to say he became acutely ill that day and died.

==Awards==
Thompson was a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and received the organization&#x27;s Iven C. Kincheloe Award as the Outstanding Experimental Test Pilot of 1966 for his research flights in the M2 lifting bodies. He also received the 1967 Octave Chanute Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) for his lifting-body research.

The National Aeronautic Association named Thompson as one of its 1990 &quot;Elder Statesman of Aviation&quot;. This distinction, given since 1955, highlights contributions &quot;of significant value over a period of years&quot; in the field of aeronautics.

Thompson wrote several technical papers, was a member of NASA&#x27;s Senior Executive Service, and received several NASA awards. His 1992 book, &quot;At the Edge of Space&quot; described the X-15 flight program. In 1993 he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor.

<doc id="972078" wikidata="Q840649" url="?curid=972078" title="Garrote">
<text>A garrote ( ; alternatively spelled as garotte and similar variants) or garrote vil () is a weapon and a method of capital punishment. It consists of a handheld ligature of chain, rope, scarf, wire, or fishing line, used to strangle a person.

==Assassination weapon==
A garrote can be made of different materials, including ropes, cloth, cable ties, fishing lines, nylon, guitar strings, telephone cord or piano wire. A stick may be used to tighten the garrote; the Spanish word refers to the stick itself. In Spanish, the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a torture device.

Since World War II, the garrote has been regularly employed as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of killing sentries and other enemy personnel. Instruction in the use of purpose-built and improvised garrottes is included in the training of many elite military units and special forces. A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire; the wire is looped over a sentry&#x27;s head and pulled taut in one motion. Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion have used a particular type of double-loop garrote (referred to as &quot;la loupe&quot;), where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victim&#x27;s neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils, the other is tightened.

Garrote-like assassination techniques were widely employed in 17th- and 18th-century India, particularly by the Thuggee cult. Practitioners used a yellow silk or cloth scarf called a rumāl. The Indian version of the garrote frequently incorporates a knot at the center intended to aid in crushing the larynx, decreasing the communication capabilities of the victim, while someone applies pressure to the victim&#x27;s back, usually using a foot or knee.

==Execution device==
The garrote () is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the Second Catilinian Conspiracy, where conspirators including Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura were strangled with a &quot;laqueus&quot; in the Tullianum, and the implement is shown in some early reliefs, e.g., &quot;Répertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains&quot;, tome I, p. 341 (1919). It was also used in the Middle Ages in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the &quot;conquista&quot; of the Americas, notably in the execution of the Inca emperor Atahualpa.

It was intended as a more merciful form of execution than death by burning, where heretics who converted to Christianity after their conviction would receive a quick strangulation from the Spanish Inquisition. A later version of the garrote used an iron collar with a large metal screw in the back. The theory was that when the screw was tightened, it would crush the brain stem and kill the victim instantly. But if the screw missed the point where the brain meets the spinal column, it would simply bore into their neck while the iron collar strangled them.

In the Ottoman Empire, execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version, a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar.

During the Peninsular War of 1808–1814, French forces regularly used the garrote to execute Spanish &quot;guerrilleros&quot;, priests, and other opponents of Napoleonic rule. Around 1810 the earliest known metallic garrote appeared in Spain, and on 28 April 1828, the garrote was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country. In May 1897, the last public garroting in Spain was performed in Barcelona. After that, all executions were performed inside prisons.

===Abolition===
The last civilian executions in Spain, both by garroting, were those of the poisoner Pilar Prades in May 1959 and the spree killer José María Jarabo in July 1959. Recent legislation had caused many crimes (such as robbery–murder) to fall under the jurisdiction of military law; thus, prosecutors rarely requested civilian executions. Military executions were still performed in Spain until the 1970s. The garrotings of Heinz Chez (real name Georg Michael Welzel) and Salvador Puig Antich in March 1974, both convicted in the Francoist State of killing police officers, were the last state-sanctioned garrotings in Spain and in the world.

With the 1973 Penal Code, prosecutors once again started requesting execution in civilian cases, but the death penalty was abolished in 1978 after dictator Francisco Franco&#x27;s death. The last man to be sentenced to death by garroting was José Luis Cerveto &quot;el asesino de Pedralbes&quot; in October 1977, for a double robbery–murder in May 1974. Cerveto requested execution, but his sentence was commuted. Another prisoner whose civilian death sentence was commuted was businessman Juan Ballot, for the contract killing of his wife in Navarre in November 1973.

After the death penalty was abolished in Spain, the writer Camilo José Cela obtained a garrote (which had probably been used for the execution of Puig Antich) from the &quot;Consejo General del Poder Judicial&quot; to display at his foundation. The device was kept in storage in Barcelona, and was displayed in the room that the Cela Foundation devoted to his novel &quot;La familia de Pascual Duarte&quot; until Puig Antich&#x27;s family asked for its removal.

In 1990, Andorra became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garrotting, though this method had not been employed there since the late 12th century.

<doc id="972079" wikidata="Q1502719" url="?curid=972079" title="Genuine progress indicator">
<text>Genuine progress indicator (GPI) is a metric that has been suggested to replace, or supplement, gross domestic product (GDP). The GPI is designed to take fuller account of the well-being of a nation, only a part of which pertains to the size of the nation&#x27;s economy, by incorporating environmental and social factors which are not measured by GDP. For instance, some models of GPI decrease in value when the poverty rate increases. The GPI separates the concept of societal progress from economic growth.

The GPI is used in ecological economics, &quot;green&quot; economics, sustainability and more inclusive types of economics. It factors in environmental and carbon footprints that businesses produce or eliminate, including in the forms of resource depletion, pollution and long-term environmental damage. GDP is increased twice when pollution is created, since it increases once upon creation (as a side-effect of some valuable process) and again when the pollution is cleaned up; in contrast, GPI counts the initial pollution as a loss rather than a gain, generally equal to the amount it will cost to clean up later plus the cost of any negative impact the pollution will have in the meantime. While quantifying costs and benefits of these environmental and social externalities is a difficult task, &quot;Earthster-type databases could bring more precision and currency to GPI&#x27;s metrics.&quot; It has been noted that such data may also be embraced by those who attempt to &quot;internalize externalities&quot; by making companies pay the costs of the pollution they create (rather than having the government or society at large bear those costs) &quot;by taxing their goods proportionally to their negative ecological and social impacts&quot;.

GPI is an attempt to measure whether the environmental impact and social costs of economic production and consumption in a country are negative or positive factors in overall health and well-being. By accounting for the costs borne by the society as a whole to repair or control pollution and poverty, GPI balances GDP spending against external costs. GPI advocates claim that it can more reliably measure economic progress, as it distinguishes between the overall &quot;shift in the &#x27;value basis&#x27; of a product, adding its ecological impacts into the equation&quot;. Comparatively speaking, the relationship between GDP and GPI is analogous to the relationship between the gross profit of a company and the net profit; the net profit is the gross profit minus the costs incurred, while the GPI is the GDP (value of all goods and services produced) minus the environmental and social costs. Accordingly, the GPI will be zero if the financial costs of poverty and pollution equal the financial gains in production of goods and services, all other factors being constant.

==Motivations==

Some economists assess progress in an economy&#x27;s welfare by comparing its gross domestic product over time — that is, by adding up the annual dollar value of all goods and services produced within a country over successive years. However, GDP was not intended to be used for such purpose. It is prone to productivism or consumerism, over-valuing production and consumption of goods, and not reflecting improvement in human well-being. It also does not distinguish between money spent for new production and money spent to repair negative outcomes from previous expenditure. For example, it would treat as equivalent one million dollars spent to build new homes and one million dollars spent in aid relief to those whose homes have been destroyed, despite these expenditures arguably not representing the same kind of progress. This is relevant for example when considering the true costs of development that destroys wetlands and hence exacerbates flood damages. Simon Kuznets, the inventor of the concept of GDP, noted in his first report to the US Congress in 1934:the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income. 

In 1962, he also wrote:

Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run... Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what. 

Some have argued that an adequate measure must also take into account ecological yield and the ability of nature to provide services, and that these things are part of a more inclusive ideal of progress, which transcends the traditional focus on raw industrial production.

==Theoretical foundation==
The need for a GPI to supplement indicators such as GDP was highlighted by analyses of uneconomic growth in the 1980s, notably that of Marilyn Waring, who studied biases in the UN System of National Accounts.

By the early 1990s, there was a consensus in human development theory and ecological economics that growth in money supply was actually reflective of a loss of well-being: that shortfalls in essential natural and social services were being paid for in cash and that this was expanding the economy but degrading life.

The matter remains controversial and is a main issue between advocates of green economics and neoclassical economics. Neoclassical economists understand the limitations of GDP for measuring human well-being but nevertheless regard GDP as an important, though imperfect, measure of economic output and would be wary of too close an identification of GDP growth with aggregate human welfare. However, GDP tends to be reported as synonymous with economic progress by journalists and politicians, and the GPI seeks to correct this shorthand by providing a more encompassing measure.

Some economists, notably Herman Daly, John B. Cobb and Philip Lawn, have asserted that a country&#x27;s growth, increased goods production, and expanding services have both costs and benefits, not just the benefits that contribute to GDP. They assert that, in some situations, expanded production facilities damage the health, culture, and welfare of people. Growth that was in excess of sustainable norms (e.g., of ecological yield) had to be considered to be uneconomic. According to the &quot;threshold hypothesis&quot;, developed by Manfred Max-Neef, &quot;when macroeconomic systems expand beyond a certain size, the additional benefits of growth are exceeded by the attendant costs&quot; (Max-Neef, 1995). This hypothesis is borne out in data comparing GDP/capita with GPI/capita from 17 countries. The graph demonstrates that, while GDP does increase overall well-being to a point, beyond $7,000 GDP/capita the increase in GPI is reduced or remains stagnant. Similar trends can be seen when comparing GDP to life satisfaction as well as in a Gallup Poll published in 2008.

According to Lawn&#x27;s model, the &quot;costs&quot; of economic activity include the following potential harmful effects:

*Cost of resource depletion
*Cost of crime
*Cost of ozone depletion
*Cost of family breakdown
*Cost of air, water, and noise pollution
*Loss of farmland
*Loss of wetlands

Analysis by Robert Costanza also around 1995 of nature&#x27;s services and their value showed that a great deal of degradation of nature&#x27;s ability to clear waste, prevent erosion, pollinate crops, etc., was being done in the name of monetary profit opportunity: this was adding to GDP but causing a great deal of long term risk in the form of mudslides, reduced yields, lost species, water pollution, etc. Such effects have been very marked in areas that suffered serious deforestation, notably Haiti, Indonesia, and some coastal mangrove regions of India and South America. Some of the worst land abuses for instance have been shrimp farming operations that destroyed mangroves, evicted families, left coastal lands salted and useless for agriculture, but generated a significant cash profit for those who were able to control the export market in shrimp. This has become a signal example to those who contest the idea that GDP growth is necessarily desirable.

GPI systems generally try to take account of these problems by incorporating sustainability: whether a country&#x27;s economic activity over a year has left the country with a better or worse future possibility of repeating at least the same level of economic activity in the long run. For example, agricultural activity that uses replenishing water resources, such as river runoff, would score a higher GPI than the same level of agricultural activity that drastically lowers the water table by pumping irrigation water from wells.

===Income vs. capital depletion===

Hicks (1946) pointed out that the practical purpose of calculating income is to indicate the maximum amount that people can produce and consume without undermining their capacity to produce and consume the same amount in the future. From a national income perspective, it is necessary to answer the following question: &quot;Can a nation&#x27;s entire GDP be consumed without undermining its ability to produce and consume the same GDP in the future?&quot; This question is largely ignored in contemporary economics but fits under the idea of sustainability.

==In legislative decisions==
The best-known attempts to apply the concepts of GPI to legislative decisions are probably the &quot;GPI Atlantic&quot;, an index, not an indicator, invented by Ronald Colman for Atlantic Canada, who explicitly avoids aggregating the results obtained through research to a single number, alleging that it keeps decisions makers in the dark; the Alberta GPI created by ecological economist Mark Anielski to measure the long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability of the province of Alberta and the &quot;environmental and sustainable development indicators&quot; used by the Government of Canada to measure its own progress to achieving well-being goals.

The Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators program is an effort to justify state services in GPI terms. It assigns the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, an officer in the Auditor-General of Canada&#x27;s office, to perform the analysis and report to the House of Commons. However, Canada continues to state its overall budgetary targets in terms of reducing its debt to GDP ratio, which implies that GDP increase and debt reduction in some combination are its main priorities.

In the European Union (EU) the Metropole efforts and the London Health Observatory methods are equivalents focused mostly on urban lifestyle.

The EU and Canadian efforts are among the most advanced in any of the G8 or OECD nations, but there are parallel efforts to measure quality of life or standard of living in health (not strictly wealth) terms in all developed nations. This has also been a recent focus of the labour movement.

==Calculation==

The calculation of GPI presented in the simplified form is the following:

GPI = A + B - C - D + I

A is income weighted private consumption

B is value of non-market services generating welfare

C is private defensive cost of natural deterioration

D is cost of deterioration of nature and natural resources

I is increase in capital stock and balance of international trade

The GPI indicator is based on the concept of sustainable income, presented by economist John Hicks (1948). The sustainable income is the amount a person or an economy can consume during one period without decreasing his or her consumption during the next period. In the same manner, GPI depicts the state of welfare in the society by taking into account the ability to maintain welfare on at least the same level in the future.

==Components==

The Genuine Progress Indicator is measured by 26 indicators which can be divided into three main categories: Economic, Environmental, and Social. Some regions, nations, or states may adjust the verbiage slightly to accommodate their particular scenario. For example, the GPI template uses the phrase &quot;Carbon Dioxide Emissions Damage&quot; whereas the state of Maryland uses &quot;Cost of Climate Change&quot; because it also accounts for other greenhouse gases (GHG) such as methane and nitrous oxide.

==Development in the United States==
Non-profit organizations and universities have measured the GPI of Vermont, Maryland, Colorado, Ohio, and Utah. These efforts have incited government action in some states. As of 2014, Vermont, Maryland, Washington and Hawai&#x27;i have passed state government initiatives to consider GPI in budgeting decisions, with a focus on long-term cost and benefits. Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s GPI spans the years from 2000 to 2020 and will be updated annually.

In 2009, the state of Maryland formed a coalition of representatives from several state government departments in search of a metric that would factor social well-being into the more traditional gross product indicators of the economy. The metric would help determine the sustainability of growth and economic progress against social and environmental factors typically left out of national indicators. The GPI was chosen as a comprehensive measure of sustainability as it has a well-accepted scientific methodology that can be adopted by other states and compared over time. Maryland&#x27;s GPI trends are comparable to other states and nations that have measured their GPI in that gross state product (GSP) and GPI have diverged over the past four decades where GSP has increased more rapidly than GPI. While economic elements of GPI have increased overall (with a significant drop off during the Great Recession), social well-being has stagnated, with any values added being cancelled out by costs deducted, and environmental indicators, while improving slightly, are always considered costs. Combined, these elements bring the GPI below GSP. However, Maryland&#x27;s GPI did increase by two points from 2010 to 2011.

The calculation methodology of GPI was first developed and published in 1995 by Redefining Progress and applied to US data from 1950 to 1994. The original work on the GPI in 1995 was a modification of the 1994 version of the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare in Daly and Cobb. Results showed that GDP increased substantially from 1950 to 1994. Over the same period, the GPI stagnated. Thus, according to GPI theory, economic growth in the US, i.e., the growth of GDP, did not increase the welfare of the people over that 44 year period. So far, GPI time-series have been calculated for the US and Australia as well as for several of their states. In addition, GPI has been calculated for Austria, Canada, Chile, France, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland, and the rest of the UK.

==Development in Finland==
The GPI time-series 1945 to 2011 for Finland have been calculated by Statistics Finland. The calculation closely followed the US methodology. The results show that in the 1970s and 1980s economic growth, as measured by GDP, clearly increased welfare, measured by the GPI. After the economic recession of the early-1990s the GDP continued to grow, but the GPI stayed on a lower level. This indicates a widening gap between the trends of GDP and GPI that began in the early-1990s. In the 1990s and 2000s the growth of GDP has not benefited the average Finn. If measured by GPI, sustainable economic welfare has actually decreased due to environmental hazards that have accumulated in the environment. The Finnish GPI time series have been updated by Dr Jukka Hoffrén at Statistics Finland.

Within EU&#x27;s Interreg IV C FRESH Project (Forwarding Regional Environmental Sustainable Hierarchies) GPI time-series were calculated to Päijät-Häme, Kainuu and South-Ostrobotnia (Etelä-Pohjanmaa) regions in 2009–2010. During 2011 these calculations were completed with GPI calculations for the Lappland, Northern Ostrobothnia (Pohjois-Pohjanmaa) and Central-Ostrobothnia (Keski-Pohjanmaa) regions.

==Criticism==

GPI considers some types of production to have a negative impact upon being able to continue some types of production. GDP measures the entirety of production at a given time. GDP is relatively straightforward to measure compared to GPI. Competing measures like GPI define well-being, which are arguably impossible to define. Therefore, opponents of GPI claim that GPI cannot function to measure the goals of a diverse, plural society. Supporters of GDP as a measure of societal well-being claim that competing measures such as GPI are more vulnerable to political manipulation.

Finnish economists Mika Maliranta and Niku Määttänen write that the problem of alternative development indexes is their attempt to combine things that are incommensurable. It is hard to say what they exactly indicate and difficult to make decisions based on them. They can be compared to an indicator that shows the mean of a car&#x27;s velocity and the amount of fuel left.

They add that it indeed seems as if the economy has to grow in order for the people to even remain as happy as they are at present. In Japan, for example, the degree of happiness expressed by the citizens in polls has been declining since the early 1990s, the period when Japan&#x27;s economic growth stagnated.

<doc id="972085" wikidata="Q906267" url="?curid=972085" title="Shina (word)">
<text>Shina is a largely archaic name for China. Its use in Japanese originally had a neutral connotation, but the word came to be perceived as derogatory by Chinese people during the course of the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars. As a result, it fell into disuse after World War II and is now viewed as offensive, with the standard Japanese name for China being replaced by .

During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, the word was used as a form of protest against the Chinese government but also as a xenophobic remark against mainland Chinese.

== Origins and early usage ==

The Sanskrit word (), meaning &quot;China&quot;, was transcribed into various forms including (), (), () and (). Thus, the term &quot;Shina&quot; was initially created as a transliteration of , and this term was in turn brought to Japan with the spread of Chinese Buddhism. Some scholars believe that the Sanskrit , like Middle Persian and Latin , is derived from the name of the state of Qin, which founded a dynasty (, Old Chinese: ) that ruled China from 221 to 206 BC, and so &quot;Shina&quot; is a return of &quot;Qin&quot; to Chinese in a different form.

The Sanskrit term for China eventually spread into China, where its usage was closely related to Buddhism. A Tang dynasty (618–907) poem titled &quot;Ti Fan Shu&quot; (, literally &quot;topic of a Sanskrit book&quot;) by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang uses the term in Chinese () to refer to China, which is an early use of the word in China:
==Early modern usage==

The Latin term for China was , plural of . When Arai Hakuseki, a Japanese scholar, interrogated the Italian missionary Giovanni Battista Sidotti in 1708, he noticed that , the Latin plural word Sidotti used to refer to China, was similar to &quot;Shina&quot;, the Japanese pronunciation of . Then he began to use this word for China regardless of dynasty. Since the Meiji Era, &quot;Shina&quot; had been widely used as the translation of the Western term &quot;China&quot;. For instance, &quot;sinology&quot; was translated as &quot;&quot; ().

At first, it was widely accepted that the term &quot;Shina&quot; or &quot;Zhina&quot; had no political connotations in China. Before the Chinese Republican era, the term &quot;Shina&quot; was one of the names proposed as a &quot;generalized, basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for &#x27;China. Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, Song Jiaoren, and Liang Qichao, used the term extensively, and it was also used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. The term &quot;transcended politics, as it were, by avoiding reference to a particular dynasty or having to call China the country of the Qing&quot;. With the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, however, most Chinese dropped &quot;Shina&quot; as foreign and demanded that Japan replace it with the Japanese reading of the Chinese characters used as the name of the new Republic of China , with the short form .

Nevertheless, the term continued to be more-or-less neutral. A Buddhist school called () was established as late as in 1922 in Nanjing. In the meantime, &quot;Shina&quot; was used as commonly in Japanese as &quot;China&quot; in English. Derogatory nuances were expressed by adding extra adjectives, e.g. or using derogatory terms like , originating from a corruption of the Taiwanese Hokkien pronunciation of , used to refer to any &quot;chinaman&quot; or &quot;chink&quot;.

Despite interchangeability of Chinese characters, Japan officially used the term from 1913 to 1930 in Japanese documents, while () was used in Chinese ones. was the literal translation of the English &quot;Republic of China&quot; while was the Japanese pronunciation of the official Chinese characters of . The Republic of China unofficially pressed Japan to adopt the latter but was rejected.

Japan rejected the terms and its short form () for four reasons:
# A term referring to China as the &quot;Middle kingdom&quot; or the &quot;center of the world&quot; was deemed arrogant
# Western countries used &quot;China&quot;
# &quot;Shina&quot; had been the common name in Japan for centuries
# Japan already has a Chūgoku region, in the west of its main island Honshu. The name was officially adopted by Japan in 1930, but &quot;Shina&quot; was still commonly used by the Japanese throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

== Post-war derogatory connotations ==
The Second Sino-Japanese War fixed the impression of the term &quot;Shina&quot; as offensive among Chinese people. In 1946, the Republic of China demanded that Japan cease using &quot;Shina&quot;.

In China, the term &quot;Shina&quot; has become linked with the Japanese invasion and Japanese war crimes, and has been considered an offensive ethnic slur ever since. The Japanese for exclusive use as a racist term, since the character (Japanese ; Chinese ) means &#x27;branch&#x27; which could be interpreted to suggest that the Chinese are subservient to the Japanese, the characters were originally chosen simply for their sound values, not their meanings.

In modern Japan, the term refers to the Republic of China, while refers to the People&#x27;s Republic of China; the terms use the same Chinese characters (with Japanese &quot;shinjitai&quot; simplifications) used officially in both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China. Likewise, in most cases, words previously containing &quot;Shina&quot; have been altered; for example, the term for sinology was changed from to or , and the name for the Second Sino-Japanese War has changed from terms such as and to .

Writing &quot;Shina&quot; in Japanese is considered socially unacceptable and subject to &quot;kotobagari&quot;, especially the kanji form; if &quot;Shina&quot; is used, it is now generally written in katakana () rather than with the kanji (), which in Japanese serves as a way to spell offensive words ( English &quot;f*ck&quot;). As such, the term has survived in a few non-political compound words in Japanese, and even (rarely) in Chinese. For example, the South and East China Seas are called and , respectively, in Japanese (prior to World War II, the names were written as and ). &quot;Shinachiku&quot; ( or simply ), a ramen topping made from dried bamboo, also derives from the term &quot;Shina&quot;, but in recent years the word has replaced this as a more politically correct name. Some terms that translate to words containing the &quot;Sino-&quot; prefix in English retain &quot;Shina&quot; within them, for example (Sino-Tibetan languages) and (&quot;Sinanthropus pekinensis&quot;, also known as Peking Man). Meanwhile, one of the Chinese names for Indochina is ().

Even so, it is still sometimes seen in written forms such as , an alternative name for ramen, a dish which originates from China. Many Japanese are not fully aware of Chinese feelings towards the term, and generally find &quot;Shina&quot; merely old-fashioned and associated with the early and mid-20th century, rather than derogatory and racist. This difference in conception can lead to misunderstandings. The term is a slur when used toward Ryukyuans by mainland Japanese people.

Sinologist Joshua A. Fogel mentioned that, &quot;Surveying the present scene indicates much less sensitivity on the part of Chinese to the term &quot;Shina&quot; and growing ignorance of it in Japan&quot;. He also criticized Shintaro Ishihara, a right-wing nationalist politician who went out of his way to use the expression () and called him a &quot;troublemaker&quot;. He elaborated further:

== Current usage ==

=== In Japan ===
Japanese Canadian historian Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi mentioned that there are two classes of postwar Japanese that have continued to use derogatory terms like &quot;Shina&quot;: poorly educated and/or elderly persons who grew up with the term go on using these from force of habit.

Some right-wing Japanese appeal to etymology in trying to ascribe respectability to the continued use of Shina, since the term Shina has non-pejorative etymological origins. Wakabayashi disagreed: &quot;The term Jap also has non-pejorative etymological origins, since it derives from Zippangu () in Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;... If the Chinese today say they are hurt by the terms Shina or Shinajin, then common courtesy enjoins the Japanese to stop using these terms, whatever the etymology or historical usage might be.&quot;

=== In Hong Kong ===
During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese government classified Hong Kong residents as &quot;Shinajin&quot; (), as the term was used to refer to all who were ethnically Chinese. Hongkongers that were considered useful to the Japanese government, as well as prominent local figures such as bankers and lawyers, were recorded in a census document called the &quot;Hong Kong Shinajin Magnate Survey&quot; (). In 2016, a Hong Kong reporter was called by Japanese nationalist politician Shintaro Ishihara.

In Hong Kong, &quot;&quot;Cheena&quot;, the Cantonese pronunciation of &quot;Shina&quot;&quot;, is used in a derogative sense under the backdrop of ongoing tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China, even in official capacity, for example by Hong Kong localist politicians Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus Leung during their controversial oath swearing as elected members of the Hong Kong legislature. Ray Wong, founder of the localist group Hong Kong Indigenous, said that he uses &quot;Cheena&quot; to refer to mainland China because the Chinese Communist Party is his &quot;personal enemy&quot;.

On 15 September 2012, a Hong Kong online community organized a protest against mainlanders and parallel traders. During the protest, some demonstrators chanted &quot;&quot;Cheena&quot; people get out!&quot; On 24 September 2013, the Hong Kong political group Hongkongers Priority breached the front entrance of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Forces Hong Kong Building, the first such incident since the handover of Hong Kong. Billy Chiu, the leader of Hongkongers Priority, later announced on social media that Hongkongers Priority had successfully broken into the &quot;&quot;Cheena&quot; Army Garrison&quot;. In October 2015, an HKGolden netizen remade the South Korean song &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;, with lyrics calling mainland Chinese &quot;locusts&quot; and &quot;&quot;Cheena&quot; people&quot;, titled &quot;Disgusting &quot;Cheena&quot; Style&quot; ().

Inside Hong Kong university campuses, mainland Chinese students were referred to as &quot;&quot;Cheena&quot; dogs&quot; and &quot;yellow thugs&quot; by local students. On 18 September 2019, the 88th anniversary of the Japanese invasion of northeast China, a celebration poster was put up on the Democracy Wall of the University of Hong Kong, glorifying the Japanese invasion while advocating for democracy in Hong Kong. Hong Kong journalist Audrey Li noted the xenophobic undertone of the widespread right-wing nativism movement, in which the immigrant population and tourists are used as scapegoats for social inequality and institutional failure. 

In Hong Kong, some people consider hate speech and even discrimination toward mainland Chinese morally justified by a superiority complex influenced by Hong Kong&#x27;s economic and cultural prominence during the Cold War, and nostalgia toward British rule. Some protesters choose to express their frustrations on ordinary mainlanders instead of the Chinese government. With rising tribalism and nationalism in Hong Kong and China, xenophobia between Hong Kongers and mainlanders is reinforced and reciprocated. Some critics of Hong Kong&#x27;s pro-democracy movement argue that the prevalence of ethnic hatred and xenophobia amongst its supporters is mostly ignored by the media, which often frames the situation as simply a fight between democracy and authoritarianism.

<text>Joanna Noëlle &quot;JoJo&quot; Levesque (born December 20, 1990) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She began performing in singing competitions and local talent shows as a child. In 2003, record producer Vincent Herbert noticed her after she competed on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Kids&quot; and asked her to audition for his record label Blackground Records. After signing with the label, JoJo released her eponymous debut studio album in 2004. It peaked at number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over four million copies worldwide to date.

With her debut single &quot;Leave (Get Out)&quot; peaking atop the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Top 40 chart, JoJo became the youngest solo artist in history to top the chart at age 13. The song peaked at 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA along with its follow-up single &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;. Her second studio album &quot;The High Road&quot; (2006) spawned her first top-five Hot 100 hit &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot;. The album was later certified gold, selling over three million copies worldwide. By 2007, JoJo had sold more than seven million records worldwide, including 2.1 million albums in the United States.

Record label disputes delayed JoJo from commercially releasing her third studio album; she released two mixtapes independently, &quot;Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot; (2010) and &quot;Agápē&quot; (2012). After her contractual release, JoJo signed with Atlantic Records in 2014 and released her first commercial EP &quot;III&quot; (2015), followed by her third studio album &quot;Mad Love&quot; (2016), which became her third top-ten album in the U.S. She left Atlantic in 2017 and founded her record label Clover Music through a joint venture with Warner Records, where she re-recorded and re-released her debut and second albums as the label&#x27;s first project in 2018. In 2020, JoJo released her fourth and fifth studio albums &quot;Good to Know&quot; and &quot;December Baby&quot;, followed by her sixth studio album &quot;Trying Not to Think About It&quot; in 2021.

In addition to her music career, JoJo has also pursued an acting career. In 2006, she made her on-screen feature film debut in &quot;Aquamarine&quot; and later starred in &quot;R.V.&quot;. She has also had guest appearances on the television shows &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; (2002), &quot;American Dreams&quot; (2004), &quot;Romeo!&quot; (2006), &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2011) and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (2017). Other films JoJo has appeared in include the Lifetime Television film &quot;True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet&quot; (2008) and &quot;G.B.F.&quot; (2013). She made her Broadway debut in 2023 playing &quot;Satine&quot; in &quot;Moulin Rouge! The Musical&quot;.

==Early life==
Joanna Noëlle Levesque was born on December 20, 1990, in Brattleboro, Vermont, but raised in Foxborough, Massachusetts. She is of Polish, French, Irish, and Native American descent. Her father, Joel Maurice Levesque (January 8, 1955–November 14, 2015), sang as a hobby, and her mother, Diana Levesque (née Blagden) sang in a Catholic church choir and was trained in musical theater. JoJo&#x27;s parents divorced when she was four years old, and she was raised as an only child by her mother. The name JoJo was a childhood nickname.

As a child, JoJo listened as her mother practiced hymns. She started singing when she was two years old by imitating everything from nursery rhymes to R&amp;B, jazz, and soul tunes. As a child, JoJo enjoyed attending Native American festivals and acted locally in professional theaters.

In 1998, JoJo appeared on the television show &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things: On the Road in Boston&quot; with American comedian and actor Bill Cosby, and she sang a song by singer Cher. In 1999, she auditioned on the television show &quot;Destination Stardom&quot;, singing Aretha Franklin&#x27;s 1967 hit &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;.

In 2001, JoJo recorded a demo disc titled &quot;Joanna Levesque&quot; which features covers of soul and R&amp;B songs. The following year, she performed on &quot;Maury&quot; during a &quot;kids-with-talent&quot; episode.

==Career==
===2003–2005: &quot;JoJo&quot;===
In mid-2003, JoJo competed on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Kid&quot; (losing to Diana DeGarmo). Record producer Vincent Herbert contacted her and asked her to audition for Blackground Records.

In 2003, at age 12, JoJo signed with Blackground Records and its imprint Da Family Entertainment and began working with producers for her first album. JoJo&#x27;s gold-certified debut single &quot;Leave (Get Out)&quot; was released in 2004. Following the single&#x27;s release, JoJo embarked on her first tour, the Cingular Buddy Bash with pop rock singer Fefe Dobson, hip hop duo Young Gunz, rap rock band Zebrahead, and teen pop stars Ryan Cabrera and Busted. It stopped at nine malls, starting at Atlanta&#x27;s Northlake Mall and ending at South Shore Plaza near her hometown of Foxborough. When the single reached number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart, she became, at age thirteen, the youngest solo artist to have a number-one single in the United States. The first single was nominated for Best New Artist at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, which made JoJo the youngest MTV Video Music Award nominee. Her first album, the platinum-selling &quot;JoJo&quot;, was released in 2004, peaking at number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number ten on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, selling 95,000 copies in its first week and reaching the top forty of the UK Albums Chart. In September 2004, JoJo released her second single, the gold-selling &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;. The single version of the song features rapper Bow Wow. It peaked at number twenty-two in the U.S. and number eight in the UK. The final single from the album, &quot;Not That Kinda Girl&quot;, was released in 2005 and peaked at number eighty-five in Germany.

In December 2004, she was nominated for Female New Artist of the Year and Mainstream Top 40 Single of the Year at the Billboard Music Awards, becoming the youngest artist ever to be nominated at the awards. Later that month, JoJo was requested by First Lady Laura Bush to perform on the 2004 Christmas in Washington special. In 2005, JoJo participated in &quot;Come Together Now&quot;, a charity single to benefit the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. JoJo hosted and performed at the Hope Rocks Concert in 2005 to benefit City of Hope National Medical Center. In 2005, she was offered a role on the Disney Channel television series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, but she turned down the role in favor of developing her music career.

===2006–2007: &quot;The High Road&quot; and acting===
In 2006, JoJo was cast opposite Emma Roberts and Sara Paxton in &quot;Aquamarine&quot;, playing Hailey. The film opened on March 3, 2006, opening at number five with $7.5 million. Her second major film, &quot;RV&quot;, a comedy starring Robin Williams, was released on April 28, 2006. It opened at number one and grossed $69.7 million.

JoJo&#x27;s second album, &quot;The High Road&quot;, was released on October 17, 2006. The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 108,000 units. It was produced by Scott Storch, Swizz Beatz, J. R. Rotem, Corey Williams, Soulshock &amp; Karlin and Ryan Leslie. It received mainly positive reviews. The album was preceded by the release of the single &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; in the summer of 2006. &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; broke the record for the biggest jump into the top three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, moving from number 66 to number three in one week; this record was previously held by Mariah Carey with her 2001 single &quot;Loverboy&quot;, which went from number 60 to number two. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;How to Touch a Girl&quot;, experienced less success. It charted just outside the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaked at number 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop 100. &quot;Anything&quot; was released as the third single and charted moderately in the UK. The album sold over 550,000 copies and was certified gold by the RIAA in December 2006.

On July 20, 2007, JoJo&#x27;s version of &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; by Sean Kingston leaked on the internet titled &quot;Beautiful Girls Reply&quot;. One month later, it was released as a promotional single and debuted at number thirty-nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythmic Top 40 chart. In late 2007, JoJo stated that she would be writing songs for her third album, to be released when she turned 18. She said she wanted her fans to &quot;see growth&quot; in her music.

===2008–2013: Label troubles, &quot;Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me,&quot; and &quot;Agápē&quot;===

In an April 2008 interview, JoJo stated that she was writing and producing an upcoming album in Boston and Atlanta. On August 30, 2008, JoJo posted her own version of the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Believe It&quot;, originally performed by T-Pain. In August 2008, JoJo played the role of Morgan Carter in &quot;True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet&quot; which was broadcast on Lifetime Television. On June 3, 2009, JoJo stated on her YouTube account that she was waiting for her record label to sign a distribution deal to release her album which was to be titled &quot;All I Want Is Everything&quot;. In August 2009, JoJo filed a lawsuit against her record label Blackground Records and its imprint Da Family Entertainment for putting her in musical limbo. She reportedly sought $500,000 for damages and to be released from her contract. In October 2009, JoJo reached a deal with Blackground Records and her third album was to be distributed by Interscope Records. In late 2009, JoJo appeared on Timbaland&#x27;s &quot;Shock Value II&quot; as a featured artist on the song &quot;Lose Control&quot; and as a background vocalist on &quot;Timothy Where You Been&quot; from the same album with the Australian band Jet.

In September 2010, JoJo released her first mixtape &quot;Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot; which spawned the single &quot;In the Dark&quot;. In late 2010, JoJo made cameo appearances in music videos for Keri Hilson and Clinton Sparks. In January 2011, JoJo was cast in an episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. In February 2011, JoJo announced that she had changed the title of her third studio album from &quot;All I Want Is Everything&quot; to &quot;Jumping Trains.&quot; She also announced that her upcoming single would be titled &quot;The Other Chick&quot; and that a music video for the song was in production. However, neither the video or single were officially released, with JoJo citing that both her and her label had a desire to move forward with a promotional push for a different song, following her recording of new material. In June 2011, she released a re-interpretation of rapper Drake&#x27;s song &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot;, renamed &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room (Can&#x27;t Do Better)&quot; through Rap-Up&#x27;s YouTube channel. Drake himself expressed his appreciation for her interpretation.

On August 29, 2011, &quot;Disaster&quot; was released to U.S. radio. The song saw her continue in a similar style to her previous hits, which was praised by critics for not &quot;jumping on the synthpop bandwagon&quot;, but also criticized for not showing much progression after a five-year hiatus. &quot;Disaster&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 87, but fell off the chart the next week. The single failed to impact any chart internationally. In support of the single, she opened for the Joe Jonas &amp; Jay Sean Tour. JoJo gave her first televised performance of the song on &quot;Good Day Dallas&quot; on September 29, and later performed on a small promotional tour for &quot;Pinktober&quot;. A music video for the song premiered on JoJo&#x27;s website in November 2011. In August 2011, JoJo signed a promotional deal with HeartSoul clothing to become the new face for their Fall/Winter collection. In December 2011, JoJo signed a deal with skin care brand Clearasil to become the new spokeswoman for Clearasil&#x27;s PerfectaWash.

In October 2012, JoJo was cast and began working on the film &quot;G.B.F.&quot; JoJo was cast as Soledad Braunstein who is the President of the Gay Straight Alliance. The film was shot in Los Angeles over 18 days by director Darren Stein. In early 2012, JoJo toured with Big Time Rush for five dates of their Better with U Tour. A promotional single, &quot;Sexy to Me&quot;, was made available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon on February 28, 2012. JoJo, wanting to go in a new direction with her third studio album, premiered &quot;Demonstrate&quot;, produced by Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib, on July 17, 2012. It was intended to be the new lead single from &quot;Jumping Trains,&quot; but its commercial and radio release as a single was eventually scrapped despite a music video having been filmed.

After Blackground Records lost their distribution deal through Interscope Records in late 2012, resulting once again in the delay of the release of an album, JoJo began recording new material specifically for a new mixtape to be released by the end of the year, as she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to keep the fans waiting for new music any longer&quot;. On November 15, 2012, she announced the release of a mixtape, titled &quot;Agápē&quot;, which means &quot;unconditional love&quot; in Greek. The project was released for free through digital download on her 22nd birthday on December 20, 2012. In support of the mixtape, JoJo embarked on her first headlining North American tour, The Agápē Tour. &quot;We Get By&quot; was released as the lead single from the mixtape on November 15, 2012. &quot;André&quot; was released as the second single from the mixtape on November 30, 2012; a music video for the song premiered on March 21, 2013, through &quot;Complex&quot; magazine.

===2014–2018: Label changes, &quot;III.&quot;, &quot;Mad Love&quot; and re-recording albums===

On July 30, 2013, it was reported that JoJo had filed a lawsuit against her labels Blackground Records and Da Family for &quot;irreparable damages to her professional career&quot;. She claimed that her 2004 contract with the labels should have expired in 2011, as she was a minor when it was signed and minors cannot sign contracts that last more than seven years under New York State law. In December 2013 both of JoJo&#x27;s and Blackground&#x27;s attorneys agreed to drop the case as both parties came to an agreement outside court. On January 14, 2014, it was announced that JoJo was released from her multi-year battle with the label and signed a new recording contract with Atlantic Records. On February 14, she released an extended play, titled &quot;#LoveJo&quot;, featuring covers of three classic songs, which were all produced by Da Internz. On March 16, 2014, she performed at SXSW.

On August 5, 2015, JoJo&#x27;s website under Atlantic was relaunched. On August 20, 2015, JoJo released three singles simultaneously on the &quot;III.&quot; extended play, which she referred to as a &quot;tringle&quot;, as a preview of her third studio album. In support of the release, JoJo embarked on the I Am JoJo Tour, her first world tour, in November 2015. On December 18, 2015, JoJo released the sequel to &quot;#LoveJo&quot;, titled &quot;#LoveJo2&quot;.

In May 2016, JoJo received co-writing credits on the single &quot;Free Somebody&quot; by Luna. In June 2016, Fifth Harmony announced that JoJo would be one of the opening acts on their 7/27 Tour. On July 27, 2016, JoJo released the lead single &quot;Fuck Apologies&quot;, featuring rapper and label mate Wiz Khalifa. &quot;Mad Love&quot;, JoJo&#x27;s third studio album was released on October 14, 2016, ten years following the release of &quot;The High Road&quot;. JoJo received co-writing credits on every track on the album. The album entered and peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 6. In January 2017, JoJo embarked on the Mad Love tour, a four-month concert tour of North America and Europe.

In August 2017, JoJo announced her departure from Atlantic, in conjunction with announcing her new music venture, Clover Music, in a joint deal with Interscope. In April 2018, she announced the Leaks, Covers, &amp; Mixtapes tour, which began on May 29. On December 21, 2018, JoJo released new versions of her debut album and &quot;The High Road&quot;, as well as her singles &quot;Demonstrate&quot;, and &quot;Disaster&quot;all with re-recorded vocals and slightly reworked production. The albums were the first releases from Clover Music, which was later announced have transitioned affiliation from Interscope to Warner Records.

===2019–2022: &quot;Good to Know&quot; and &quot;Trying Not to Think About It&quot;===
On February 14, 2019, JoJo and R&amp;B singer-songwriter PJ Morton released the single &quot;Say So&quot;, a duet. &quot;Say So&quot; was included as the lead single on Morton&#x27;s album &quot;Paul&quot;. On October 11, 2019, JoJo released the single &quot;Joanna&quot; alongside a music video for the song. On October 25, JoJo collaborated with Alabama rapper Chika on the single &quot;Sabotage&quot;, which was intended to be the first single from her next album.

On May 1, 2020, JoJo released her fourth studio album &quot;Good to Know&quot;. Like her previous record, JoJo again co-wrote every song on the album. The lead single &quot;Man&quot; was released on March 13, 2020. On August 7, 2020, JoJo released &quot;What U Need&quot; as the lead single from the deluxe version of &quot;Good to Know&quot;, which followed on August 28, 2020. A tour supporting the album was set to begin in April 2021, but was later canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 2, 2020, she released &quot;The Change&quot;, written by Diane Warren, to serve as the official anthem for the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign. On October 30, 2020, JoJo released her first holiday album and fifth studio album &quot;December Baby&quot;.

In 2021, JoJo competed on the fifth season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Black Swan&quot;. She finished in second place and was the first female runner-up on the show. On September 24, 2021, Blackground Records and Empire Distribution re-released JoJo&#x27;s original debut album and &quot;The High Road&quot; to streaming services. The re-releases took JoJo by surprise. JoJo does not profit financially from these re-releases and she instead encouraged fans to listen to her 2018 re-recordings of the albums instead, writing on Twitter: &quot;A stream of the re-recorded 2018 version supports me and helps me continue to do what I love. Streaming the original unfortunately does not.&quot;

On October 1, 2021, JoJo released her sixth studio album &quot;Trying Not to Think About It,&quot; which was preceded by the single &quot;Worst (I Assume)&quot;. It was followed by a six-date tour which started the next day. The album was further promoted through the 42-date world tour, JoJo Tour 2022, which began the following year.
JoJo contributed to Stan Walker&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;All In&quot;, collaborating on the song &quot;Remember Us&quot;, which she also co-wrote.

===2023–present: &quot;Moulin Rouge! The Musical&quot;, &quot;Over the Influence&quot; and &quot;NGL&quot;===
On April 11, 2023, JoJo made her Broadway debut in the leading role of Satine in &quot;Moulin Rouge! The Musical&quot;. On February 9, 2024, she released a cover of the REO Speedwagon single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot;. The single was featured in the 2024 film &quot;Lisa Frankenstein&quot;, directed by JoJo&#x27;s friend and sometime-collaborator, Zelda Williams. A music video was released the day before, interspersing clips from the film and JoJo performing the song in a recording studio.

On March 7, 2024, JoJo announced in an interview with &quot;People&quot; at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Women in Music event that she will release new music later in the year, as well as her first memoir. On September 17, 2024, &quot;Over the Influence: A Memoir&quot; was released. &quot;Porcelain&quot; was released on October 2 of the same year, in a joint venture between Clover Music and BMG Rights Management. The following month, she released &quot;Too Much to Say&quot;. Her extended play &quot;NGL&quot; was released on January 24, 2025.

==Artistry==

Musically, JoJo is considered to be primarily a pop and R&amp;B artist; however, the majority of her singles tend to lean more towards the former as a marketing tool. &quot;Prefix&quot;&#x27;s Norman Meyers observed that &quot;As an adolescent white girl singing mainstream R&amp;B, her singles have leaned toward pop to snag sales ... But the list of producers on &quot;The High Road ...&quot; shows that Jojo is more concerned with harder beats and soulful sounds.&quot; JoJo is a mezzo-soprano and her singing voice has been widely acclaimed by music critics, one of whom ranked it among &quot;the best in the game&quot;, while her R&amp;B recordings have been compared to the likes of R&amp;B singers Brandy and Monica. Describing her as a &quot;vocal phenom&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Leah Greenblatt enthused that JoJo is &quot;capable of Mariah Carey-style upper-register flourishes&quot;. Vocally, critics frequently draw comparisons between JoJo and singers Kelly Clarkson and Beyoncé, while &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Sal Cinquemani remarked that the singer &quot;could very well be the next Teena Marie&quot;.

At times some of her material and use of melisma has been criticized for being overproduced and overused, respectively. Emma Morgan of Yahoo! Music dismissed JoJo as &quot;mercilessly multi-tracked à la J. Lo, her voice encoded flatteringly as she too-many-notes her way through a succession of R&#x27;n&#x27;B beats and hooks that owe everything to studio wizardry and little to simple songwriting&quot;, lacking experience and soul. While admitting that JoJo is &quot;surprisingly adept at frenzied, sexually possessed hollering&quot;, Alex Macpherson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; believes that the singer &quot;is, however, at her best when compulsively dissecting emotional situations straight out of high-school movies via the medium of big, heartfelt choruses&quot;. Pegging JoJo as &quot;a teen-pop star with an R&amp;B singer&#x27;s voice&quot;, Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; continued, &quot;she can outsing much of the competition, but it also means more ballads ... and more not-quite-credible lovesick lyrics.&quot; JoJo&#x27;s earliest memories of singing are performing songs by Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston for customers in hair salons. Her mixtape, &quot;Agápē&quot;, was influenced by musicians Joni Mitchell and James Taylor.

JoJo possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, which Jordan Riefe of &quot;Maxim&quot; described as &quot;better suited to R&amp;B.&quot; Upon making her mainstream debut in 2004, critics immediately noticed that JoJo&#x27;s vocal prowess and material exceeded her age. When she released her single &quot;Demonstrate&quot; in 2012, critics observed that both the singer&#x27;s voice and lyrics had matured alongside her. Subsequently, JoJo&#x27;s second mixtape &quot;Agápē&quot; drew attention from both critics and the singer&#x27;s own family due to its mature content; &quot;Agápē&quot; features lyrical references to drinking, drug abuse and sex, which were absent from her previous &quot;G-rated&quot; releases. The mixtape also addresses her conflict with her record label. JoJo&#x27;s early image followed popular trends related to hip hop culture at the time. The cover of JoJo&#x27;s first album features the singer donning a T-shirt and cap, which Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; dismissed as &quot;contrived and calculated&quot;. Matt Collar of AllMusic wrote, &quot;Jojo is an assured and likeable performer who can somehow embody the yin-yang persona of a suburban cheerleader slinging hip-hop attitude.&quot; According to Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the singer &quot;has become a role model to suburban adolescents who talk gangsta but still carpool to school in mom&#x27;s Kia Sorento.&quot;&quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alex Macpherson commented that &quot;In an era of boozy Amys, gobby Lilys and flashing Britneys, a pop star as wholesome as JoJo seems almost quaint.&quot; Writing for &quot;Prefix&quot;, Norman Meyers believes that JoJo &quot;could have been a &quot;Mean Girls&quot; extra, but she has talent&quot; and &quot;comes off more like a pint-size Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera than a hip-shaking Britney clone&quot;.

==Personal life==
JoJo lived in Edgewater, New Jersey with her mother, until age 18, when she moved out, living in Boston on her own for a year. As of 2014, she resides in Los Angeles. JoJo dated American soccer player Freddy Adu from May 2005 until September 2006. The couple met on the MTV show &quot;Fake ID Club&quot; while JoJo was hosting it. JoJo made an appearance in the commentary box at a New England Revolution home game when they were playing D.C. United. In November 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the couple had split up. JoJo revealed on &quot;American Top 40&quot; with Ryan Seacrest that she and Adu were still good friends.

In August 2009, JoJo graduated from high school and stated that she would stay focused on future projects. She was accepted to Northeastern University and considered majoring in cultural anthropology but did not attend.

Aside from singing and acting, JoJo is also a supporter of various charitable organizations such as Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, World Vision, She&#x27;s the First, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and others.

In December 2021, JoJo announced her engagement to &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; (2020) actor Dexter Darden. The pair broke off their engagement the following year.

<doc id="972095" wikidata="Q477989" url="?curid=972095" title="Lick (music)">
<text>In popular music genres such as country, blues, jazz or rock music, a lick is &quot;a stock pattern or phrase&quot; consisting of a short series of notes used in solos and melodic lines and accompaniment. For musicians, learning a lick is usually a form of imitation. By imitating, musicians understand and analyze what others have done, allowing them to build a vocabulary of their own. 

In a jazz band, a lick may be performed during an improvised solo, either during an accompanied solo chorus or during an unaccompanied solo break. Jazz licks are usually original short phrases which can be altered so they can be used over a song&#x27;s changing harmonic progressions.

==Similar concepts==
A lick is different from the related concept of a riff, as riffs can include repeated chord progressions. Licks are more often associated with single-note melodic lines than with chord progressions. However, like riffs, licks can be the basis of an entire song. Single-line riffs or licks used as the basis of Western classical music pieces are called ostinatos. Contemporary jazz writers also use riff- or lick-like ostinatos in modal music and Latin jazz. Imitating style is as important as learning the appropriate scale over a given chord. Licks in rock and roll are often used through a formula, and variations technique in which variants of simple, stock ideas are blended and developed during the solo.

A lick can be a hook, if the lick meets the definition of a hook: &quot;a musical idea, a passage or phrase, that is believed to be appealing and make the song stand out&quot;, and &quot;catch the ear of the listener&quot;. A lick may be incorporated into a fill, which is a short passage played in the pause between phrases of a melody.

===Prior use of 100.3 MHz in New York City===

The first station to operate on 100.3 MHz was New York&#x27;s fourth FM radio station, which signed on the air June 1, 1942, as W63NY at 46.3 MHz in the old FM band. The station, which had become WHNF when it moved to 100.3, was co-owned with WHN and played easy listening music. After WHN changed its call sign to WMGM in 1948, WHNF followed suit by changing their call letters to WMGM-FM. The station shut down in February 1955, and surrendered its license to the Federal Communications Commission.

===WVNJ-FM (1961–1983)===
In 1958, Newark Broadcasting, owner of WVNJ (620 AM), filed with the FCC for a new FM station on 100.3 MHz at Newark. It came up against a competing application for the frequency from WMGM, proposing operation in New York City. The FCC opted to award the station to Newark, as it found that a second major FM service for Newark was more equitable than a 14th for New York City. On June 1, 1961, WVNJ-FM signed on from the AM site in Livingston, New Jersey, moving a few years later to West Orange, New Jersey.

The station, using the moniker &quot;WVNJoy&quot;, focused on serving northern New Jersey rather than New York City. It featured an instrumentally based easy listening format (also known as beautiful music or, more commonly, &quot;elevator music&quot;) consisting of instrumental versions of familiar songs with several soft vocal hits added per hour.

In 1980, when WRVR changed from jazz to country music, WVNJ began playing jazz music after 8 pm. Its slogan was &quot;WVNJoy&#x27;s beautiful music by day, jazz by night&quot;. In May 1983, plans were made for 100.3 FM to be purchased by Cleveland-based Malrite Communications. Malrite moved the station&#x27;s studios to Secaucus, New Jersey and the transmitter to the Empire State Building. In addition, new management announced plans for a Top 40 format. The sale became final on August 1, 1983, and WVNJ-FM ceased broadcasting on 100.3 that night.

===WHTZ - &quot;Z100&quot; (1983–present)===
====Early years====

The station, which now had the call sign WHTZ, went back on the air at 6:08 am on August 2, with new program director and morning jock Scott Shannon. The first two songs ever played on the station were &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; by Survivor, and &quot;America&quot; by Neil Diamond. The station&#x27;s call sign represents the word &quot;hits&quot; with a Z, a fact pointed out in an early station advertising campaign where it was proclaimed that &#x27;finally, there&#x27;s a new way to spell Hitz!&#x27; to advertise the new format.

Within 74 days of signing on, in autumn 1983, WHTZ had climbed from last place to first in the New York Arbitron ratings book. Over the years, Z100 stayed with a top 40 format, while maintaining high ratings. Scott Shannon left Z100 on January 27, 1989, to start &quot;Pirate Radio&quot; in Los Angeles, which was part of Westwood One Inc.&#x27;s new radio division. Steve Kingston assumed programming/operations manager duties, Frankie Blue became assistant programming director, and Brian Wilson took over mornings.

In 1983, Sean &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hamilton was brought in to be WHTZ&#x27;s first night jock. His show became a huge success, mainly due to his feature called &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Midnight Lovelines&quot;. On November 8, 2019, Hamilton was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

On August 28, 1987, Epic Records sued WHTZ for playing Michael Jackson and Siedah Garrett&#x27;s song &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; the day before it was supposed to debut. The song was supposed to be released on July 21, but WHTZ played it on the afternoon of July 20.

====1990s: Changes====
Wilson was replaced in July 1990, with Gary Bryan, who came over from WPLJ.

On June 6, 1991, WHTZ was accused of making sexist and racist comments when Steve Kingston told listeners to &quot;be a JAP (Jewish-American princess) for a day&quot;. The station also played games with viewers such as &quot;JAP trivia&quot; and they also created a JAP Rap that they would play. While The Anti-Defamation League criticized The Morning Zoo for their anti-semitic and sexist comments, Kingston defended the station by saying the statements were harmless.

By 1991, the Top 40 format nationwide was in an identity crisis due to the rise of alternative rock, hip-hop and country. A major sign of this crisis came when WPLJ moved to a hot adult contemporary format by 1992. Z100 responded to this by adding some older songs and introducing an evening talk show called &quot;Love Phones&quot;, which began on November 2. Ratings gradually dropped during this time. In March 1993, Malrite (Z100&#x27;s owners) announced it would merge with Shamrock Broadcasting, with the sale closing that August. In July, Bryan left the morning show; in November, John Lander became morning show host. Also that year, Z100 dropped the older songs and began mixing in a moderate amount of rock music which wasn&#x27;t normally being played on Top 40 stations. Initially, the station had a rock lean, but during the course of 1994, alternative rock began to become prevalent on the station.

By the end of 1994, the majority of the station&#x27;s music consisted of alternative rock with only a few non-modern-rock-based songs per hour (mostly the big current hits). The station still played the current popular hits by mainstream artists such as Madonna, TLC, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Seal, Bon Jovi, and others; notably, though, Z100 snubbed several big pop hits in 1995, such as &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot; by Bryan Adams, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; by Michael Jackson, and &quot;I Could Fall in Love&quot; by Selena. The station also snubbed some dance hits as well, except during their Saturday night dance show, &quot;Planet Z&quot;. During this time, the station also underwent numerous airstaff and management changes; Frankie Blue left in 1995, and Sam Milkman moved up to his position. Also in 1995, Z100 stopped using the &quot;Morning Zoo&quot; title, which was simply renamed &quot;The Morning Show&quot;. Morning host John Lander left in November 1995, due to his contract not being renewed, with more airstaff gradually leaving the station shortly thereafter.

Ratings, though nowhere near the top anymore, remained steady at the station during much of the mid-1990s. However, by March 1996, there was a steep drop after WKTU signed on at 103.5 FM with a dance music format, and WXRK adapted a full-time alternative-leaning active rock format; both stations took listeners from Z100. Steve Kingston and his assistant Sam Milkman left Z100 for WXRK in spring 1996, while music director Andy Shane left for WKTU, joining another former Z100 music director, Frankie Blue. In January 1996, Steve Cochran arrived to do mornings, but by mid-April, he was gone. Z100 was undergoing a crisis at this point. The station was sold in a corporate deal to Chancellor Media.

====1996: Turnaround====
In April 1996, the station brought in Tom Poleman as its new programming director. Initially, at that point, Z100 dropped all non-modern rock titles and began playing strictly pop alternative. (In addition, &quot;Planet Z&quot; became a new wave show as well). By May 1996, Z100 began gradually replacing its on-air staff, and the harder alternative songs were phased out. Though it initially seemed that Z100 was becoming a modern AC station, beginning that summer, the station gradually began to move back to a mainstream Top 40 format, as it added pop music from such formats as R&amp;B, rap, and adult contemporary. Late in July 1996, dance music returned to &quot;Planet Z&quot;.

One of Poleman&#x27;s biggest moves was to switch DJ Elvis Duran from afternoons to the &quot;Z Morning Zoo&quot; (which was known as &quot;The Morning Show&quot; for the last year), Z100&#x27;s popular morning show, on April 22 of that year. Despite having shared the post with other hosts (such as Elliot Segal, now at WWDC) through the years, Duran remains the &quot;Head Zookeeper&quot; to this day. By December 1996, Z100 was a full-time Top 40 station again. Chancellor merged with Evergreen in 1997, making WKTU a sister station of Z100. Still, both stations continued on the same courses, moderately overlapping with music.

In a 1999 merger, Z100&#x27;s parent company, Chancellor, acquired Capstar, forming AMFM Inc. Shortly after the merger was finalized, AMFM was bought by Clear Channel Communications.

====2000s====
In 2001, Clear Channel entered into an agreement with XM Satellite Radio to carry WHTZ on the satellite radio service.

The station used to broadcast &quot;mini-mixes&quot; by DJ Spinbad, a well-known DJ who created a nightly mash-up mix of the day&#x27;s top songs, playing them all together, mixing, for instance, the lyrics of one with the music of another. This often lasted 15–20 minutes, and was played at seven o&#x27;clock and ten o&#x27;clock Monday through Friday. Spinbad&#x27;s mix was also a part of the weekly &quot;5 O&#x27;Clock Whistle&quot;, a tradition started in 1986 to celebrate the end of the work week.

In early 2006, Z100 launched an HD Radio station that plays songs by bands who have not gone mainstream, or have very little exposure.

In October 2007, after years of hovering near the top, Z100 once again became the highest-rated station in New York City, scoring a 5.1 rating in persons 12+ in the Summer book. That marked the first number-one finish for the station since the 1980s, according to Clear Channel New York programming guru Tom Poleman. It also scored a first-place among the 18-34 demographic in the book, as well as a second place in the 25–54 demo.

In 2008, remixer Jason Nevins joined Z100 for the &quot;Remix at 6 with Jason Nevins&quot;, where one of Jason&#x27;s remixes is played every night at 6 pm. The programming follows the Z100 playlist and gives listeners a &quot;you heard it here first&quot; mix premiere of projects that come straight from Jason&#x27;s studio.

During the 2000s, Z100&#x27;s slogan &quot;New York&#x27;s #1 Hit Music Station&quot;, used in tandem on-air with &quot;All The Hits&quot;. The long-running &quot;#1&quot; part of the slogan was removed in 2007, then brought back during spring 2014. Another former slogan was &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Music&quot;.

====2010s====
In 2010, WHTZ changed its own logo.

WHTZ-HD2 was the flagship station for Nick Radio, a Top 40 station aimed at children and pre-teens which broadcasts nationwide through iHeartRadio&#x27;s app and uses WHTZ personnel. The station was launched in late September 2013, and was quietly shut down in late July 2019.

On September 16, 2014, Clear Channel, WHTZ&#x27;s owners, renamed themselves to their current name of iHeartMedia after its increasingly successful iHeartRadio Internet radio platform.

In 2017, Mark Medina, program director of WHTZ, was named top pop programmer of the year by Billboard. He succeeded programmer Sharon Dastur, as Dastur took on a position at iHeartRadio, Z100&#x27;s parent company.
====2020s====
On June 18, 2020, SiriusXM removed the WHTZ simulcast from its satellite radio service, continuing to offer the station on streaming packages. This was followed by its removal from the SiriusXM service altogether in June 2022, alongside corporate sibling KIIS-FM leaving the SiriusXM platform as well, thus pushing remaining listeners to the iHeartRadio platform.

Z100 broadcasts a mainstream Top 40 format. A majority of the music played on Z100 tends to be pop, R&amp;B, alternative rock, hip-hop, rock, EDM, and dance. &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;, syndicated nationally via Premiere Networks, is heard daily. The station is the New York home for Premiere Networks&#x27; &quot;American Top 40&quot;, which is also hosted by Seacrest and airs Sunday mornings.

In 2022, a documentary about the radio station entitled &quot;Worst to First: The True Story of Z100 New York&quot; was released.

On March 13, 2024, Mark Medina announced that he would leave WHTZ for SVP/programming of the iHeart Phoenix cluster. He was succeeded by Mark Adams who is also vice president of CHR for the station&#x27;s parent company on May 1.

==Morning show==

The first version of the &quot;Z Morning Zoo&quot; came together within two months of sign-on, and featured Michael Scott Shannon, Ross Brittain, Jack Murphy, John &quot;JR Nelson&quot; Marik, Claire Stevens, John &quot;Professor Jonathan B.&quot; Bell, with Kevin &quot;Captain&quot; Smith, and Anita Bonita. It also gained rapid popularity for its use of the character &quot;Mr. Leonard&quot;, invented by radio personality John Carrillo of KKBQ in Houston in 1986, who subsequently moved the character to New York.

As of 2020, the morning show includes Elvis Duran, Danielle Monaro, Gandhi, Froggy, Skeery Jones, David Brody, &quot;Straight Nate&quot; Marino, producer Sam, Garrett, Scotty B, Coaster Boy Josh, Diamond, and Producer Jake.

&quot;The Z100 Morning Show&quot; features &quot;Danielle&#x27;s Entertainment Report&quot;, News Reports with Gandhi, &quot;Phone Taps&quot; (prank calls to an unsuspecting friend or relative of a listener), Song Parodies, various contests, news and traffic reports.

The show was simulcast on WHCY in western New Jersey from early 2003, until December 23, 2008, and then again from 2010 until the station&#x27;s format switch in 2022. The show began syndication on May 22, 2006, starting with WHYI in Miami, followed by WIOQ in Philadelphia on July 23, 2008, and Cleveland&#x27;s WAKS on August 25, 2008.

Until May 2008, the show was known as &quot;Elvis Duran and The (Y/Z) Morning Zoo&quot;. By July 2008, the &quot;Zoo&quot; references were later replaced with &quot;Show&quot;. In March 2009, Clear Channel subsidiary Premiere Radio Networks added Elvis Duran and the Morning Show to its blue-ribbon lineup of nationally syndicated radio programs and is now heard coast to coast on over 70 stations. &quot;Elvis Duran and the Morning Show&quot; had both its 20th anniversary as a show and its 10th anniversary as a syndicated program in 2016.

==Annual events==
The station annually holds popular concerts featuring the world&#x27;s top-name acts: &quot;Z100&#x27;s Jingle Ball&quot; at Madison Square Garden in Midtown Manhattan during the winter holiday season, and Z100&#x27;s Zootopia in late Spring (which was last held in 2009).

The 2011 Jingle Ball was considered the biggest Jingle Ball Z100 has ever had in their existence. It drew in the biggest stars in the world including Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, David Guetta, Pitbull, and LMFAO.

From 1983 to 1991, and from 1997 to 2004, Z100 aired the &quot;24 Hours Of Christmas&quot; from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day. Sometimes it began at noon, and other years it would be as late as 2 pm. It was one of the first major-market Top 40 stations to play wall-to-wall Christmas music at the time. The music consisted of Christmas songs by the station&#x27;s core artists mixed with well-known Christmas music by oldies artists and some traditional easy listening type artists. The station played about 125 songs in total, which were repeated over this 24-hour period. When Scott Shannon arrived at WPLJ, he began the same tradition there in 1991. Z100 discontinued the tradition in 1992 and during the &quot;alternative years&quot;. By 1997, more core artists began creating Christmas music. As a result, Z100 reinstated the 24 hours of Christmas that year. It continued until 2004, when it was discontinued due to the desire to counter-program other co-owned stations as well as competitors.

From 1997 to 2015, the station also aired a pre-recorded countdown show of the top 100 songs for the year, based on the total number of song spins, listener requests, and weekly playlist success (peak position, weeks on). The show was then repeated an average of once a day over the following week, with a final broadcast airing in January. Between 1997 and 2004, the countdown began at noon on Christmas Day after the &quot;24 Hours Of Christmas&quot;; the start date moved to Christmas Eve in 2005, which was the last year where Elvis Duran and Paul &quot;Cubby&quot; Bryant hosted the show. In June 2006, Cubby left Z100 to co-host the nationally syndicated &quot;Wake Up with Whoopi&quot; Goldberg program, which was heard on WKTU until Goldberg left that station. Songs that were released in the final quarter of the year could have been problematic; if a song is very popular during the last three months of the year and is in high rotation, it would often peak higher than a song that had been in medium rotation for a number of months. However, if a popular song is only in low to medium rotation during the later part of the year, it would often chart very low or not at all on the year-end countdown, only to appear very high on the countdown of the following year.

<doc id="972111" wikidata="Q751649" url="?curid=972111" title="Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer">
<text>The Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer was a British STOL transport aircraft built by Scottish Aviation Limited at Prestwick Airport, Scotland, during the 1950s. It was designed for both civil and military operators. It was conceived as a twin-engined version of the Pioneer light transport. Both aircraft required &quot;an area only 30m (99ft) by 275m (902ft) in which to operate.&quot;

==Design and development==

Powered by two Alvis Leonides radial engines, the Twin Pioneer was a high-wing cabin monoplane with a triple fin and rudder assembly and fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The prototype Twin Pioneer, registered &quot;G-ANTP&quot;, first flew at Prestwick Airport on 25 June 1955. Flight trials demonstrated that the aircraft had a very short landing run and the aircraft was displayed at the September 1955 Society of British Aircraft Constructors Show at Farnborough.

Three pre-production aircraft were built for trials, and sales and demonstrations.

In 1958, the 33rd aircraft was used as a prototype for the Series 2 with Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp R-1340 radial engines of which 5 had been ordered by Philippine Air Lines. In 1959, a Series 3 version was developed to use the improved Alvis Leonides 531 radial engine.

Early in its operational life in 1957 the Twin Pioneer suffered two fatal accidents due to fatigue failure which caused the outer panel of the wing to detach from the aircraft in flight. This issue required significant re-design of the structure and adversely impacted sales.

==Operational history==
The military version could carry external stores such as bombs under the stub wings. One aircraft became the first aircraft for the newly formed Royal Malaysian Air Force when it was delivered on 16 January 1962; the type served with the air force for 12 years.

The Royal Air Force ordered 39 aircraft, which were built between 1958 and 1959, deployed in Aden and the Far East. It was used extensively by British forces in the Malayan Emergency and the later confrontation in Borneo. In August 1959, No. 78 Squadron RAF at Khormaksar received some Twin Pioneers to supplement its single engine Pioneers. The Twin Pioneers were employed in moving troops and supplies around the wilderness and on occasions lending support to the Sultan of Oman. A series of double engine failures caused problems with the squadron losing two aircraft on the same day. Unsuitable soft and hard landing strips were also causes of failures during landings.

Other squadrons that operated the Twin Pioneers were No. 152 Squadron RAF based at Muharraq in Bahrain and No. 21 Squadron RAF, which reformed with the type at Benson in May 1959. The squadron then moved to Kenya and in June 1965 to Aden. No. 152 operated around the Persian Gulf and in 1959, No. 209 Squadron RAF based at Seletar began to receive Twin Pioneers. These operated in Borneo and Malaya. The SRCU (Short Range Conversion Unit) at RAF Odiham also flew three Twin Pioneers for aircrew training. RAF No. 230 Squadron in the UK was the last military operator of the Twin Pioneer. The squadron operated the type in an interesting sand-colour camouflage scheme.

Although mainly used in military operations, the Twin Pioneer was also successful as a commercial transport for operation in areas without proper airfields, where unprepared surfaces were often the norm. Twin Pioneers were sold as survey aircraft to oil exploration companies with some of the first sales to Rio Tinto Finance and Exploration Limited, and the Austrian and Swiss government survey departments. Three were used by the &#x27;Kroonduif&#x27; in Dutch New Guinea.

One Twin Pioneer served as a STOL training aircraft with the Empire Test Pilot School (ETPS) at RAE Farnborough for many years.

==Variants==

*Twin Pioneer : Prototype aircraft with Alvis Leonides 503 radial engines, one built.
*Twin Pioneer Series 1 : Production aircraft with Alvis Leonides 514 radial engines, 23 built.

<text>Ian J. Lygo (born September 1958) is a British civil servant from Hemel Hempstead, who made 75 appearances on the UK game show &quot;100%&quot; in late 1998, with the 75th appearance occurring on 14 December of that year. On 30 November 2004 this record was tied by Ken Jennings on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. However, because Jennings lost on his 75th appearance, Lygo became the sole holder of the record for &quot;most consecutive wins&quot; on a game show. This record has since been broken, with a team from the Spanish version of the game show Boom! holding the current record at 505, although he still holds the record for English-language game shows. Since he won £100 for each game, his total winnings were £7,500.

After his 73rd win, Grundy Productions, the producers of &quot;100%&quot;, informed Lygo that they had changed the rules. From now on they were limiting the number of wins to only twenty-five, after receiving letters from viewers saying they were fed up of him winning day after day, week after week (by that time, he was in his fifteenth week on the programme). &quot;I was given no warning,&quot; Lygo told &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;. &quot;The producer came up and said, &#x27;We are changing the format.&#x27; He said there was a new limit. I had no choice in the matter. I was told I could do two more shows and that was that. I wanted it to be made plain on the show that I was being stopped, but that didn&#x27;t happen. The announcer (Robin Houston) just said, &#x27;Well done&#x27; and &#x27;goodbye.&#x27;&quot; According to UKGameShows.com, he believed that retiring after 100 episodes would have been more fitting with the show&#x27;s theme. Lygo was, however, given a bottle of champagne by Grundy for his achievement.

After Lygo&#x27;s run, the producers later decided to restrict the number of consecutive wins to 25.

Lygo has a degree in history from the University of Kent. He was chosen for the show after an audition at a hotel in Devon. He works for the Highways Agency.

<doc id="972114" wikidata="Q3495663" url="?curid=972114" title="Chopin (vodka)">
<text>Chopin is a single-ingredient vodka, 4 times distilled from either potatoes, rye or wheat. It is produced by Siedlce-based &quot;Podlaska Wytwórnia Wódek Polmos&quot;. Chopin was first introduced to North America in 1997. The production is done in small batches. The producer claims three kilograms (seven pounds) of potatoes are used to make every bottle of Chopin.

The vodka is named after the famous Romantic composer Frédéric Chopin.

Chopin potato vodka has been submitted to a number of international spirit ratings for evaluation, including the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, and the Beverage Testing Institute. Outcomes have generally been favorable, particularly after 2005. For instance, between 2006 and 2011, Chopin potato vodka earned one double gold, three gold, and two silver medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Proof66&#x27;s aggregate rating, which incorporated these scores and others, put the spirit in the 90th percentile among all rated vodkas.

<doc id="972115" wikidata="Q331287" url="?curid=972115" title="Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer">
<text>Charles Edward Maurice Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, (born 20 May 1964), styled Viscount Althorp between 1975 and 1992, is a British peer, author, journalist, and broadcaster. He is the younger brother of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the maternal uncle of William, Prince of Wales, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.

==Early life and education==
Charles Edward Maurice Spencer was born in London on 20 May 1964, the youngest of five children of John Spencer (1924–1992) and Frances Roche (1936–2004; later Shand Kydd). Owing to his maternal family&#x27;s close personal connection to the royal family, he was baptised in Westminster Abbey, with Queen Elizabeth II acting as one of his godmothers. He grew up with his three elder sisters, Sarah, Jane, and Diana, the last-named of whom he was very close with. His infant brother, John, was born four years before him, but died ten hours after his birth, thus leaving Charles as the eventual heir to the earldom. Spencer was three years old when his parents&#x27; troubled marriage ended in divorce due to his mother&#x27;s affair with Peter Shand Kydd. In 1975, Spencer became styled as Viscount Althorp when his father became Earl Spencer following the death of his paternal grandfather. He began his formal education at Silfield Private School in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk. From the age of eight, he was sent to the elite boy&#x27;s private boarding school Maidwell Hall in Northamptonshire. He was educated subsequently at Eton College and then read Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford.

In his memoir &quot;A Very Private School&quot;, published in March 2024 just a few weeks before turning 60, Spencer opened up about the vicious beatings, sexual abuse, &quot;culture of cruelty&quot;, &quot;hopelessness and abandonment&quot; and a total absence of love he was subjected to at Maidwell Hall school, one of England&#x27;s most prestigious boarding schools. Spencer recounts the trauma of being sent away from home at the age of just eight, how he was inflicted with beatings to the point of drawing blood and shares that he witnessed punishments including cutting naked &quot;buttocks [of young children] several times with a cane and carrying on&quot;. During his research for the book former pupils he interviewed revealed that they had been raped multiple times at the school, while some had lost their siblings to self-neglect. One of Spencer&#x27;s contemporaries, when terminally ill stipulated a refusal to see his parents in his living will, as he could not forgive them for his experience at the school. In an extract, Spencer detailed the sexual assaults and beatings he experienced at Maidwell, saying the school &quot;sewed demons into the linings of the souls&quot; of the abuse victims. Spencer revealed that after writing the book, he sought help at a &quot;residential treatment centre&quot; due to the &quot;trauma&quot; that resurfaced during the writing process which caused a &quot;breakdown&quot;. Spencer argues the brutalising effect of boarding schools on people who have come to power has been devastating for society. The boarding school Maidwell Hall has reported itself to the council following Spencer&#x27;s accusations, and in June 2024, Northamptonshire Police announced they had begun an investigation.

==Career==
Spencer worked as an on-air correspondent with NBC News from 1986 to 1995, primarily for the network&#x27;s morning programme, &quot;Today&quot;, and &quot;NBC Nightly News.&quot; He wrote and presented the 12-part documentary series &quot;Great Houses of the World&quot; (1994–1995) for NBC Super Channel. He also worked as a reporter for Granada Television from 1991 to 1993.

Spencer has written several book reviews for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; as well as feature stories for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and American publications such as &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Verandah&quot; and &quot;Nest&quot;.

Upon his father&#x27;s death on 29 March 1992, 27-year-old Spencer succeeded as 9th Earl Spencer, 9th Viscount Althorp, 9th Viscount Spencer of Althorp, 9th Baron Spencer of Althorp, and 4th Viscount Althorp. He also inherited Althorp, the family&#x27;s ancestral seat in Northamptonshire. Since 2009, he has restored Althorp, re-roofing it and restoring its entire exterior for the first time since the 1780s. He has also helped establish Althorp Living History, a handmade fine-furniture line reproducing pieces from the collection at Althorp. The Spencer family&#x27;s wealth derived from their profitable sheep farming in the Tudor era.

On 31 August 1997, his older sister Diana died after a car crash in Paris and Spencer delivered the eulogy at her funeral service held at Westminster Abbey six days later. In his eulogy he rebuked both Britain&#x27;s royal family and the press for their treatment of his sister. Spencer ruled out conspiracy theories concerning his sister&#x27;s death, and called the alleged letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she discussed her fears of a planned accident &quot;just a bizarre coincidence rather than tied in with reality.&quot; Spencer received an apology from Tim Davie, the BBC&#x27;s director general, in late 2020 for the unethical practices used by BBC staff to gain his sister&#x27;s consent to be interviewed in November 1995 for the corporation&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; television programme. Former BBC chairman Michael Grade said a full inquiry should be conducted which Davie has said will happen.

Spencer was a member of the House of Lords from 29 March 1992 (the day his father died and he inherited the peerage) until the House of Lords Act 1999 excluded most hereditary peers on 11 November 1999.

On several occasions, Spencer has been accused of refusing to allow his sister Diana to live in a cottage on the Althorp estate, despite her request at the height of her emotional difficulties. These allegations have repeatedly been proven to be untrue, as seen in an apology published by &quot;The Times&quot; in 2021, admitting that &quot;having considered his sister&#x27;s safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties included Wormleighton Manor [in Warwickshire], the Spencer family&#x27;s original ancestral home&quot;.

Diana was buried on an island in a lake on Spencer&#x27;s ancestral estate, Althorp, where he built a garden temple memorial and a museum to her memory, displaying her wedding dress and other personal effects. The museum was opened to the public in 1998 with all profits going to Diana&#x27;s Memorial Fund, also set up by Spencer; the museum has since closed. At this stage, Spencer began writing a series of books dealing with the estate itself and with his family history, beginning with an account of his ancestral home, &quot;Althorp: the Story of an English House&quot;, published in 1998.

In 2003, Spencer founded the Althorp Literary Festival. Speakers at the annual event have included the authors Bill Bryson, Helen Fielding, Antonia Fraser, and Boris Johnson. In 2004, he presented two documentaries for the History Channel on &quot;Blenheim: Battle for Europe&quot;.

Spencer was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Northamptonshire in November 2005; the Spencer family have had a long association with the county, the home of the family seat. Spencer is also a patron of the Northamptonshire County Cricket Club. In 2021, Spencer authored an audiovisual walking tour for St. James&#x27;s Park about the execution of Charles I entitled &quot;Death of a King: The Path to Execution&quot; on the BARD&quot;EUM&quot; mobile app. In 2023, he began presenting the podcast &quot;The Rabbit Hole Detectives&quot; with Richard Coles and Cat Jarman, in which each of them is given an obscure topic and then they discuss their findings.

==Personal life==
The Earl Spencer has seven children from three marriages.

On 16 September 1989, Spencer, then known by the courtesy title of Viscount Althorp, married Victoria Lockwood (born 20 April 1965). Spencer and Lockwood were divorced on 3 December 1997, with Diana&#x27;s death occurring while the case was in progress. After the divorce, Spencer returned to the United Kingdom from Cape Town, South Africa, where Spencer and Lockwood had relocated their family in 1995 to avoid media attention. They have four children:

* Lady Catherine “Kitty” Eleanor Spencer (born 28 December 1990); married Michael Lewis in 2021. They have a daughter, Athena. 
* Lady Elizabeth “Eliza” Victoria Spencer (born 10 July 1992)
* Lady Katya &quot;Amelia&quot; Spencer (born 10 July 1992); married Greg Mallett, nephew of former South African national rugby coach Nick Mallett, in 2023.
* Louis Spencer, Viscount Althorp (born 14 March 1994); heir apparent to the earldom.

Spencer did not attend the weddings of his daughters Kitty and Amelia in 2021 and 2023, respectively, amid reports that his relationship with his elder children had &quot;cooled&quot;.

On 15 December 2001, he married Caroline Freud (&quot;née&quot; Hutton; born 16 October 1966), former wife of businessman Matthew Freud. They separated in 2007 and later divorced. They have two children:
* The Honourable Edmund “Ned” Spencer (born 6 October 2003); DJ
* Lady Lara Caroline Spencer (born 16 March 2006)

On 18 June 2011 at Althorp, Spencer married Karen Gordon (&quot;née&quot; Villeneuve; born 6 June 1972), a Canadian philanthropist, the founder and chief executive of Whole Child International, a charity based in Los Angeles that works to improve the lot of orphaned, abandoned, or abused children. They have a daughter:
* Lady Charlotte Diana Spencer (born 30 July 2012) named in honour of her aunt, Diana, Princess of Wales.

In June 2024, it was announced that the Earl and Countess had separated in April 2024 and planned to divorce. It was reported at the same time that the Earl had become the partner to Professor Cat Jarman, with whom he was co-hosting the podcast &quot;The Rabbit Hole Detectives&quot;. Lord Spencer is to be represented by Baroness Shackleton, who represented the then-Prince of Wales in his divorce from Spencer&#x27;s sister Diana.

<text>The Koyna Dam is one of the largest dams in Maharashtra, India. It is a rubble-concrete dam constructed on Koyna River which rises in Mahabaleshwar, a hillstation in Sahyadri ranges. It is located in Koyna Nagar, Satara district, in the Western Ghats on the state highway between Chiplun (44 KM) and Karad (58 KM).

== Details ==
The main purpose of the dam is hydroelectricity with some irrigation in neighboring areas. Today the Koyna Hydroelectric Project is the second largest completed hydroelectric power plant in India having a total installed capacity of . Due to its electricity generating potential, Koyna river is considered as the &#x27;life line of Maharashtra&#x27;.

The spillway of the dam is located at the center. It has 6 radial gates. The dam plays a vital role of flood controlling in monsoon season. The catchment area dams the Koyna river and forms the Shivasagar Lake which is approximately in length. It is one of the largest civil engineering projects commissioned after Indian independence. The Koyna hydro-electric project is run by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.

The dam has withstood many earthquakes in the recent past, including the devastating 1967 Koynanagar earthquake, resulting in the dam developing some cracks. After the disaster grouting of the cracks was done. Also internal holes were drilled to relieve the hydrostatic pressures in the body of the dam. Indian scientific establishment has formulated an ambitious project to drill a deep borehole in the region and intensely study the earthquake activity. This would help in better understanding and possible forecast of earthquakes. The proposal is to drill up to 7 km and study the physical, geological and chemical processes and properties of the reservoir triggered earthquake zone in real time. It would be an international project to be led by Indian scientists.

In 1973 the non-overflow portion of the dam was strengthened, followed by strengthening the spillway section in 2006. Now the dam is expected to be safe against any future earthquake, including ones with a higher intensity than that of 1967.

<doc id="972123" wikidata="Q1225100" url="?curid=972123" title="Digitized Sky Survey">
<text>The Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) is a digitized version of several photographic astronomical surveys of the night sky, produced by the Space Telescope Science Institute between 1983 and 2006.

== Versions and source material ==
The term Digitized Sky Survey originally referred to the publication in 1994 of a digital version of an all-sky photographic atlas used to produce the first version of the Guide Star Catalog. For the northern sky, the National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey E-band (red, named after the Eastman Kodak IIIa-E emulsion used), provided almost all of the source data (plate code &quot;XE&quot; in the survey). For the southern sky, the J-band (blue, Eastman Kodak IIIa-J) of the ESO/SERC Southern Sky Atlas (known as the SERC-J, code &quot;S&quot;) and the &quot;quick&quot; V-band (blue or V in the Johnson–Kron–Cousins system, Eastman Kodak IIa-D) SERC-J Equatorial Extension (SERC-QV, code &quot;XV&quot;), from the UK Schmidt Telescope at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory, were used. Three supplemental plates in the V-band from the SERC and Palomar surveys are included (code &quot;XX&quot;), with shorter exposure times for the fields containing the Andromeda Galaxy, the Large and the Small Magellanic Cloud. The publication of a digital version of these photographic collections has subsequently become known as the First Generation DSS or DSS1.

After the original 1994 publication, more digitizations were made using recently completed photographic surveys, and released as the Second Generation DSS or DSS2. Second Generation DSS consists of three spectra bands, blue, red, and near infrared. The red part was first to complete, and includes the F-band (red, Eastman Kodak IIIa-F) plates from the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey II, made with the Oschin Schmidt Telescope at Palomar Observatory for the northern sky. Red band sources for the southern sky include the short red (SR) plates of the SERC I/SR Survey and Atlas of the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds (referred to as AAO-SR in DSS2), the Equatorial Red (SERC-ER), and the F-band Second Epoch Survey (referred to as AAO-SES in DSS2, AAO-R in the original literature), all made with the UK Schmidt Telescope at Anglo-Australian Observatory.

== Production ==
The Digitized Sky Survey was produced by the Catalogs and Survey Branch (CASB) of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). They scanned plates using one of two Perkin-Elmer PDS 2020G microdensitometers. The pixel size was 25 (&quot;First Generation&quot;, DSS1) or 15 micrometres (&quot;Second Generation&quot;, DSS2), corresponding to 1.7 or 1.0 arcseconds in the source material. The scanning resulted in images 14,000 x 14,000 (DSS1) or 23,040 x 23,040 pixels (DSS2) in size, or approximately 0.4 (DSS1) and 1.1 gigabytes (DSS2) each. The scanning of First Generation DSS takes a little under seven hours per plate to complete. Due to the large size of the images, they were compressed using an H-transform algorithm. This algorithm is lossy, but adaptive, and preserves most of the information in the original. Most of the First Generation DSS files were shrunk by a factor of seven. Similar methods were used in the production of the &quot;Second Generation&quot; DSS, but the microdensitometers have since been modified for multi-channel operation, in order to keep the scan time under 12 hours per plate.

The CASB has also published several companion scientific products. The most notable is a photometric calibration of part of the &quot;First Generation&quot; DSS. It allows photometric measurements to be made using the digital northern POSS-E, southern SERC-J, and southern Galactic Plane SERC-V data.

== Publication ==
The compressed version of the First Generation DSS was published by the STScI and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) on 102 CD-ROMs in 1994, under the name &quot;Digitized Sky Survey.&quot; It has also been made available online by the STScI and several other facilities in databases that can be queried over the web. The moniker &quot;First Generation&quot; was added later.

In 1996, a more highly compressed version of the DSS was published by the STScI and ASP under the name RealSky. RealSky files were compressed by a factor of roughly 100. RealSky consequently took up less space, but the additional compression made it inappropriate for use in photometry and fine detail in the images was degraded.

The Second Generation DSS has appeared steadily over the course of several years. In 2006, the Second Generation DSS (second epoch POSS-II and SES surveys) was finished, and distributed on CD-ROM to partner institutions. Generally, the data are available through WWW services at partner institutions.

<text>Union Terrace Gardens is a public park and gardens situated on Union Terrace in Aberdeen, Scotland.

== The gardens ==

The sunken gardens opened to the public in 1879, and cover approximately two and a half acres . The space is bounded to the north by Rosemount Viaduct, to the south by Union Street&#x27;s main thoroughfare, to the east by the railway and the Den Burn, now flowing underground, and to the west by Union Terrace.

Contrary to popular belief the area is not a natural amphitheatre but a small river valley with a late-Victorian viaduct constructed at the North end in 1889. The amphitheatre was formed from the covered remains of Denburn Terrace after demolition.

The park is surrounded by of some of the best architecture of Aberdeen, prominent among which are His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, St Mark&#x27;s Church and the Library on Rosemount Viaduct to the north, and the Triple Kirks to the east.

On the park&#x27;s north side is a formally planted and maintained floral crest of the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

At the Union Street end of the gardens stands a group of mature elm trees, nearly 200 years old. The trees stand on the remnants of the site once known as Corbie Haugh: &quot;Corbie&quot; in Scots meaning &quot;crow&quot;, and &quot;Haugh&quot; meaning a low-lying meadow in a river valley. Corbie Haugh is still an apposite epithet for this area as crows still nest in the elms. The trees were originally planted to stabilise the embankment to prevent the newly widened Union Terrace from slipping into the gardens.

The arches which run along the length of Union Terrace were designed by architect James Matthews, who was instrumental in turning the area into a pleasure park.

== Future Development - The City Garden Project ==

In 2010 controversial plans were unveiled to transform the gardens.

On 19 May, Aberdeen City Council voted in favour of the City Square project to transform the heart of the city into a vibrant, cultural civic space and gardens. At the same time an alternative plan for a contemporary art centre in the gardens, the Peacock proposal, was rejected.

Local oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood pledged up to £85 million of his own money to back the City Square project to &quot;ensure the economic survival of the city centre&quot;. The current version of the plan involves raising the level of the Gardens, creating a square which is to be a &quot;cross between a grand Italian piazza and a mini Central Park.&quot; A technical appraisal carried out by the architectural firm Halliday Fraser Munro estimated the project would cost around £140 million to build. Andrew Dixon, incoming boss of Scotland&#x27;s new arts and culture body, Creative Scotland, recently praised the project as a &quot;real opportunity for the city&quot;. As part of the project councillors stipulated that at least £15 million be provided for a new cultural centre run by Peacock.

Peacock Visual Arts had been working in partnership with Aberdeen City Council on an alternative proposal to develop a centre for contemporary arts in Aberdeen. The development, designed by London-based architects Brisac Gonzales, was designed to be built into the existing slopes in the Gardens underneath the Robert Burns statue. The building, which was budgeted at £13.5 million, would contain a gallery, TV studio, print studio, restaurant and offices for Peacock staff and provide a base for Aberdeen City Council&#x27;s Arts Development and Arts Education teams as well as potentially extra space for Citymoves dance agency. This project had received full planning permission, secured £9.5 million of public funding from Aberdeen City Council, Scottish Enterprise, and the Scottish Arts Council and was scheduled to break ground in late November 2009 before being rejected by Aberdeen city councillors.

The result of a public consultation carried out by ACSEF showed that 55% of those consulted were against the City Square proposals with 44% in favour. Nonetheless, ACSEF (Aberdeen City and Shire Economic Futures), decided to press ahead .with the project and asked the City Council for endorsement to proceed to a further stage, an international design competition. The City Square project has proved highly controversial amongst not only the citizens of Aberdeen, but many expatriate Aberdonians and others from further afield . Opponents of the project have formed a campaign group known as Friends of Union Terrace Gardens. The campaign group held a mass picnic in the gardens on 12 June 2010 which attracted over a thousand people and generated nearly 400 letters to councillors opposing the plans. On 2 March 2011, after a referendum in which 90000 people voted, it was announced that 52% had voted for the City Garden Project, moving the project to the next stage.

==Rejection of the City Garden Project==
On 22 August 2012, Aberdeen City Council finally rejected the City Garden Project by two votes. The councillors supported an alternative proposal from the Independent Alliance Group, to regenerate Union Street, the Arts Centre, the Music Hall, the Lemon Tree and the Mither Kirk.

==Future Developments - post-City Gardens Project==
Following the 2012 rejection of the City Garden Project, Sir Ian Wood stated on 21 August 2013 that he would still be willing to give £50m to replacement plans though he indicated such plans would need to be in place by the end of 2013. In December 2013, Aberdeen City Council rejected Sir Ian Wood&#x27;s offer of £50 million which was subsequently withdrawn in January 2014.

On 29 August 2013, new drawings for a potential redevelopment were unveiled and published in both national and local press. The drawings by city architect John Halliday showed the gardens being partly raised whilst leaving some areas sunken. The designs included the covering of the Denburn dual-carriageway and railway tracks to form a link to Belmont Street, the creation of a new arts centre and a new entrance to Aberdeen Rail Station. Further developments of the Halliday plans were released on 27 January 2014 centred on the addition of a canopy along a portion of Union Street running from Bridge Street to Market Street, a portion of which would be over part of the Civic Square as proposed in the August plans.

== 2019-2022 Redevelopment ==
In 2019, Union Terrace Gardens was closed for redevelopment and re-opened on 22 December 2022.

<text>&quot;Beanball&quot; is a colloquialism used in baseball, for a ball thrown at an opposing player with the intention of striking them such as to cause harm, often connoting a throw at the player&#x27;s head (or &quot;bean&quot; in old-fashioned slang). A pitcher who throws beanballs often is known as a &quot;headhunter&quot;. The term may be applied to any sport in which a player on one team regularly attempts to throw a ball toward the general vicinity of a player of the opposite team, but is typically expected not to hit that player with the ball. In cricket, the equivalent term is &quot;beamer&quot;. Some people use the term &quot;beaner&quot;, though that usage is discouraged due to the term also being an ethnic slur in the United States.

== Baseball ==
In baseball, a beanball is a pitch, similar to a brushback pitch but actually intended to hit the batter as it is thrown at the head. It is rarely used as a strategic weapon, and is usually an act of anger and frustration; however, batters facing known headhunters are given a reason to fear a beanball and may alter their approach to hitting in the interests of self-protection, perhaps giving some strategic advantage to the pitcher. Some pitchers have been known to throw beanballs in response to giving up home runs. Teams with heated rivalries often find several beanballs exchanged in a season.

Beanballs can sometimes lead to fights, charging the mound, and bench-clearing brawls. Because of the hazards of the pitch and the possibility of fights, umpires will now often warn teams, after beanballs or fights have occurred, that any pitcher who throws at a batter will be ejected from the game with a mandatory one-day suspension for the pitcher&#x27;s manager. Throwing at batters can sometimes lead to suspension for a number of games as well. Managers may also be ejected if, in the umpire&#x27;s judgment, they encouraged their pitcher to throw a beanball.

Several players&#x27; careers have been impaired or derailed after being struck with a beanball. Hall of Famer Mickey Cochrane was knocked unconscious and later hospitalized for 7 days in 1937, and never played another game. In 1941, Dodgers outfielder Pete Reiser was hospitalized for a month, one of numerous injuries which shortened his career. Lou Boudreau played only sporadically after being beaned in 1951, and retired the following season. Tony Conigliaro missed over a year after being hit in the eye, and his vision later deteriorated to the point where he was forced to retire. Dickie Thon returned from a gruesome beaning in 1984, but never matched his earlier success. On September 28, 1995, Kirby Puckett, the superstar outfielder of the Minnesota Twins, was struck in the cheek by a Dennis Martínez fastball, breaking his jaw and loosening two teeth. It would be his last game; during spring training the following year he developed glaucoma, which ended his career. In 2005, the Cubs&#x27; Adam Greenberg was hit in the head with the first pitch that he faced in his major league career. Ron Santo, who thought he had lost an eye when his cheekbone was broken by a pitch in 1966, rushed back to the lineup. He described his attitude: &quot;It was like, &#x27;Here, hit me again.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t have any fear. I just went on. When you get older, maybe fear does set in. Nobody will admit that, but it does happen.&quot; Don Zimmer, who was nearly killed by a beanball in 1953 and had four metal buttons surgically implanted in his skull, recounted, &quot;It&#x27;s not a case of being tougher than anybody else... You never know how you&#x27;re going to react until you come back and play again.&quot;

Only one player has died after being hit in the head. Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman was hit by a pitch thrown by submarine pitcher and noted headhunter Carl Mays on August 16, at the Polo Grounds in New York. He died 12 hours later and is noted as the only player to have been killed by a pitch. The following spring, Chapman&#x27;s teammates experimented with leather helmets similar to those being used by football players; that year&#x27;s Spalding Guide declared, &quot;There is nothing &#x27;sissy&#x27; about it.&quot; Catcher Roger Bresnahan is cited as one of the first players to construct and wear a helmet, in 1907.

Starting in , Major League Baseball required that all batters either wear batting helmets or protective plastic liners underneath their caps. Full helmets were made mandatory in , and wearing a model with an earflap has been required since . Minor leaguers (as well as most college, high school, and youth leagues) must wear helmets with a flap covering each ear.

<text>CounterSpin (counterspin.tv) was a Canadian television program which was broadcast on CBC Newsworld from 1998 to 2004.

A daily panel debate show, &quot;CounterSpin&quot; guests would debate issues in front of a studio audience. The show also included news reports which tried to examine the day&#x27;s issue in more depth than a typical newscast.

The show was an independent production created by executive producer Paul Jay also a documentary filmmaker (&quot;Wrestling with Shadows&quot;, &quot;Return to Kandahar&quot;). Jay went on to become the founding chair of The Real News Network. Co-creator was veteran CBC producer Ron Haggart.

The show&#x27;s host for the first three seasons was Avi Lewis. He then left the show to concentrate on other projects, and was replaced by Sharon Lewis (no relation) for one season. Sharon Lewis then went to the CBC&#x27;s main network to host &quot;ZeD&quot;, and was replaced by Carol Off.

In 2004 the CBC announced that the series would not be renewed for the fall television season, and instead a new program would be developed for its time slot. The new program, &quot;CBC News: The Hour&quot;, began on January 17, 2005, with George Stroumboulopoulos as its anchor.

<doc id="972152" wikidata="Q4979722" url="?curid=972152" title="Brushback pitch">
<text>In baseball, a brushback pitch is a pitch (typically a fastball) thrown high and inside the strike zone to intimidate the batter away from the plate on subsequent pitches. It differs from the beanball in that the intent is not to hit the batter, nor does it target the batter&#x27;s head. Hitters will often crowd the plate in order to have a better swing at pitches on the outside half of the plate. The hitters hope that the pitcher will be scared to throw inside because they might hit the batter. The brushback helps a pitcher to &quot;reclaim&quot; the corners of the strike zone by forcing the batter to stand further away.

Play-by-play announcers sometimes call a high brushback pitch as being &quot;high and tight&quot;. It is also referred to as chin music.

While the brushback can be an effective part of pitching, the home-plate umpire may warn or eject a pitcher if he feels they are intentionally trying to hit the batter.

<doc id="972163" wikidata="Q495548" url="?curid=972163" title="Kurzweil Music Systems">
<text>Kurzweil Music Systems is an American company that produces electronic musical instruments. It was founded in 1982 by Stevie Wonder (musician), Ray Kurzweil (innovator) and Bruce Cichowlas (software developer). 

Kurzweil was a developer of reading machines for the blind, and their company used many of the technologies originally designed for reading machines, and adapted them to musical purposes. They released their first instrument, the K250 in 1983, and have continued producing new instruments ever since. The company was acquired by Young Chang in 1990. Hyundai Development Company (HDC) acquired Young Chang in 2006 and in January 2007 appointed Raymond Kurzweil as Chief Strategy Officer of Kurzweil Music Systems.

===K250 synthesizer===
The company launched the K250 synthesizer/sampler in 1984: while limited by today&#x27;s standards and quite expensive, it was considered to be the first really successful attempt to emulate the complex sound of a grand piano. This instrument was inspired by a bet between Ray Kurzweil and musician Stevie Wonder over whether a synthesizer could sound like a real piano. First issued as a very large and heavy keyboard, the electronics were also issued in a very large and heavy rackmount version, as the 250RMX (Rack Mount &quot;Expander&quot;—the presumed intention being that one could drive via MIDI and sequencers one or more &quot;expanders&quot;). Additional sample ROMs were developed and issued for both models.

===K150 synthesizer===
As opposed to using &#x27;sample-based&#x27; or &#x27;subtractive&#x27; synthesis, the K150 (a rack-mount unit) uses additive synthesis. Hal Chamberlin (mentioned below) developed software to run on Apple II class computers, which would allow extensive control of the very rich possibilities of the K150. This synthesizer was never a commercial music success, but was very popular in academic and research facilities.

===K1xxx synthesizers===
The K1000 and K1200 (and their rack-mounted variants) were designed to deliver the sample libraries developed originally for the K250 to a wider audience in less expensive and physically more manageable forms. Unlike the K250, these instruments could not sample new sounds directly; but their programming architecture and operating system were evolutionary steps that would culminate in the K2xxx series. There were several keyboard versions issued, and the 1000 modules were originally issued in PX (pianos and mixed bag), SX (strings), HX (horns and winds), and GX (guitars and basses) versions, each with differing sample-ROMs. As computing and electronics technologies changed rapidly during the period, larger sample bases could be combined. The later 1200 module versions contained these larger sample bases (i.e., PX+SX; SX+HX; HX+GX).

===K2xxx synthesizers===

The company&#x27;s flagship line of synthesizer workstations, the K2xxx series, began to make real headway with the K2000, which introduced the company&#x27;s acclaimed Variable Architecture Synthesis Technology (V.A.S.T.) engine. Throughout the 1990s, updates and upgrades to the K2000 (and eventually its successors, the K2500 and K2600) ensured that the K2x series was regarded as one of the most powerful and best-sounding synthesizers/samplers available. Although initially very expensive, Kurzweil instruments were popular in top recording studios and for use with music production for film because of their high-quality sounds.

The K2000 was released in 1991 and was initially available in four versions, the K2000, K2000S, K2000R, and K2000RS. The S versions contain the hardware required for sampling, while the R versions are rack-mountable; the versions without an R feature 61 pressure-sensitive keys. The K2000 is capable of 24 voice polyphony, which is somewhat limited, although up to 3 oscillators per voice can be used and an intelligent voice stealing algorithm retires the playing notes which are estimated to be least audible rather than simply the oldest. Each voice of the K2000 is able to play a separate program, allowing for smooth transitions during live performance - this simple feature took Kurzweil&#x27;s competitors more than a decade to match. The keyboard came with 2MB of sample RAM but could be equipped with up to 64 megabytes of RAM for user loaded samples. Later models included the K2000VP (keyboard), K2000VPR (rack), K2VX (keyboard w/ optional ROMs), and K2VXS (keyboard w/ optional ROMs + sampling), which were based on the same hardware as the K2000 series but had the K2500 sound set loaded.

The K2500R and K2500/K2500X, released in 1995 and 1996 respectively, were substantial improvements to the K2000R and K2000, increasing polyphony to 48 voices and supporting up to 128MB of sample RAM. The K2500 and later K2600 models can have a single patch running 192 virtual oscillators. There were also a number of other minor improvements as well as sound expansion options (daughterboard including 4MB piano ROM expansion, 8MB orchestral ROM board and 8MB contemporary ROM board). 

The K2500 was available in 7 versions:
# K2500 - 76 note semi-weighted keyboard;
# K2500X - 88 note weighted action keyboard;
# K2500S - 76 note semi-weighted keyboard with sampling;
# K2500XS - 88 note weighted action keyboard with sampling;
# K2500AES - Audio Elite System, Limited Release (6 Units) 88 note weighted action keyboard with sampling, KDFX effects engine, all available upgrade options, and an extensive sample library (retail cost, $20,000.00).
# K2500R - rack-mounted version (no keyboard);
# K2500RS - rack-mounted version with sampling.

The keyboard models included a ribbon controller and an input for a breath controller, making them the most expressive electronic instruments available at the time. Additionally one could add digital input/output (I/O) to connect S/PDIF or ADAT inputs and a program RAM (PRAM) expansion for loading larger soundsets or MIDI songs into memory. If one had purchased a model without onboard sampling, one could add the sampling option, PRAM, and reinstall their operating system to have the upgraded model.

The Kurzweil K2600, released in 1999, improved on the K2500 with the addition of a new effects engine called KDFX and an enhancement to the V.A.S.T. engine called triple-mode. KDFX was also offered as an upgrade for the K2500 and later made available as a standalone product in the KSP8. KDFX drastically improved the quality of effects over the K2000 and K2500&#x27;s built-in effects units, and added more flexibility such as using the Kurzweil as a vocoder. But the most impressive feature of the K2600 was Kurzweil&#x27;s &#x27;Triple Strike Piano&#x27;, which was one of the most realistic-sounding sampled pianos available at the time. Patches for the K2500 were completely redesigned to incorporate the KDFX and triple strike capability. The K2600 uses different type sound expansion ROMs than the K2500 (although they contain the same samples), and could have a classic keys and General MIDI (GM) sound set added.

All K2000, K2500, K2600 and their rack mount versions can host one internal SCSI hard disk, using the appropriate factory kit (data cables, power cables, and mechanical adapters). The capacity of disks is up to 8GB split into 2GB partitions.

The K2661, released in 2004, is basically a full-featured K2600 with a 61-key keyboard, flash memory storage, and a redesigned sound set that includes the expansion sets that had been produced for the K2000, K2500, and K2600. The other difference from the K2500 and K2600 is that there is no built-in ribbon controller, although a Kurzweil external ribbon unit can be fitted via a 6P6C telephone-like connector. By design, it is not possible to mount an internal hard disk, however external SCSI storage units can be connected to the DB-25 SCSI connector on the rear of the instrument.

In 2008, all K26xx series synthesizers were discontinued by Kurzweil Music Systems, although inventory still remained . This left the PC3 and PC3X (which have no sampling capability; see below) as Kurzweil&#x27;s flagship synthesizers at that time.

In July 2021 Kurzweil announced a new K2700 flagship workstation. It was released in late 2021 in a 88-key graded-hammer weighted keyboard version. Although marketed as a new product line, the K2700 largely extends the synthesis engine and display and control layout of the Forte and PC-series performance keyboards. While it retains backward compatibility with the earlier K-series and PC-series patches, some of those sound different since certain features of the earlier K-series work differently and the effect processor layout is different.

=== PCx Series ===
In the mid 90s, Kurzweil introduced the PC88 keyboard, which was advertised more as a MIDI controller. It was good for this purpose because it had 88 fully weighted keys and the ability to set four zones for controlling different instruments. It was also a bit smaller so it was more portable than the K series instruments. The instrument itself had 64 internal sound patches and the ability to combine them together with different effects. It was common for performers to use this instrument in combination with a rack mount K series synth. The PC88MX included a General MIDI soundboard with additional high-quality sounds taken from the K2xxx series. Unlike the K2xxx series, the PCx series did not include floppy disk nor SCSI expansion, although sounds could be edited and new sounds created. Another distinguishing feature of the PCx series was the lack of an onboard sequencer.

In the 2000s, Kurzweil introduced the PC2 Series of keyboards that contained the famed Triple Strike Piano and used a V.A.S.T. synthesis engine similar to the K2xxx series, and later introduced the PC1 Series, which was a slightly cut down version of the PC2, losing only the KB3 organ mode, and some inputs and outputs.

In Spring 2008, Kurzweil launched the PC3 Performance Controller, which has next generation V.A.S.T. synthesis technology derived from the K2xxx series but vastly improved with new features, new algorithms, virtual analog synthesis, sequencer, powerful effects processor based on Kurzweil KSP8 unit, and overall better sounds than previous Kurzweil synths.

In 2011, Kurzweil released the PC3K series of keyboards, which added the ability to load K2xxx-series samples and programs (with limitations). It includes sample-playback capability and 128 Mbytes of flash memory storage for user samples.

=== SP Series ===
The initial Kurzweil SP Series are Stage Pianos based on the popular Kurzweil Micro Piano half-rack module of the mid-1990s. It provides 32 sounds including pianos, electric pianos, organs, strings and synths.
The board is also a fairly capable MIDI controller, and features two ribbon controllers.
In summer of 2007, Kurzweil launched the SP2.
===MIDIboard===
The Kurzweil MIDIboard, a dedicated MIDI controller, was conceived of and specified by Jeff Tripp, then president of Key Concepts. It was perhaps the first of the pure keyboard controllers, brought to market to complement Kurzweil&#x27;s rack mounted synthesizers. &#x27;MIDIboard&#x27; was, in fact, a Key Concepts trademark, transferred to Kurzweil Music Systems as part of a licensing agreement.

Its novel sensing system, invented and patented by Tripp and Key Concepts co-founder, John Allen, provided velocity, individual aftertouch pressure, and release velocity information from a single sensor per key. Each sensor was shaped as an arch of conductive rubber that served as one plate of a capacitor and was designed to deform (change shape under pressure) in a scaled way. The sensors were nicknamed &#x27;sushi sensors&#x27; because the first prototype was conductive rubber sheet (think &#x27;nori&#x27;) held in a barrel shape by a center of white silicone RTV (think &#x27;the rice&#x27;). Released in 1988, the MIDIboard&#x27;s software and electronics were designed under contract to Key Concepts by Hal Chamberlin, then of Micro Technology Unlimited.

The MIDIboard had its virtues and its drawbacks. It was reasonable to manufacture and relatively inexpensive for the range of input forces, both presses and impulse inputs, it could transduce. One of its drawbacks was that it was not well damped in very light playing, making touch uncertain. At some point, working for Kurzweil, Hal Chamberlin debounced this burble. A hardware fix was possible - splitting the sensors.

It contained a number of interesting innovations, some of which remain fairly uncommon. For example, most MIDI controllers provide aftertouch data, but the Midiboard is capable of polyphonic aftertouch, a feature found on few other keyboards. The MIDIboard also provides comprehensive signal routing, layering, and transposition control. These advanced features are not without their cost: the MIDIboard weighs approximately 100 lb and is fairly difficult to use.

===Artis/Forte Series===
In 2013 Kurzweil released a brand new stage piano called the &quot;Artis&quot;. Marketed as &quot;the ultimate all-in-one gigmachine&quot;, the Artis is an 88 key weighted action keyboard, in a newly designed, relatively light package of 21 kg. Featuring sounds from the PC3K series and the &quot;Kore64&quot; expansion library, and a user interface focused on easy selection, layering and splitting of sounds, the Artis is aimed at live performance. Also featuring in the Artis is a brand new &quot;German D&quot; grand piano. A newly sampled Steinway model D grand piano in six velocity layers with pedal noise effects. Other than aforementioned splitting- and layering abilities, and effects manipulation on pre-programmed controllers the Artis has no on-board editing options. However, a company called &quot;Soundtower&quot; released an editor application for Mac, PC, and iOS devices, allowing for full V.A.S.T. editing.

In the summer of 2014, the Kurzweil Forte was released as the new flagship stage piano. The Forte is based on the same architecture as the Artis, but with more features. Most notably the Forte has 16GB of &quot;flash play&quot; sample memory used for brand new piano, electric piano and clavinet samples. The same &quot;German D&quot; piano from the Artis is available in the Forte, but far more extensively sampled. The Forte adds two more dynamic layers, and string resonance. By comparison, the German D piano is 128MB in size on the Artis, and 4GB on the Forte. On top of the &quot;German D&quot; the Forte features a &quot;Japanese Grand&quot;, which is a sampled Yamaha C7 grand piano, also 4GB in size. 
Other features are a bigger sound library, bigger effects library, a bigger, full colour display, and more.

, the Artis and Forte series consisted of 6 models in total:
# Artis - the original keyboard as described above
# Artis 7 - A full featured Artis, but with 76 semi-weighted keys
# Artis SE - A cheaper, simplified Artis with fewer sounds, fewer effects and fewer controllers.
# Forte - the original keyboard as described above
# Forte 7 - A full featured Forte, but with 76 keys (unlike the Artis 7, these are fully weighted keys)
# Forte SE - A cheaper, simplified Forte with fewer sounds and effects, 128mb versions of both the German and Japanese pianos and only 2GB of &quot;Flash Play&quot; memory. The Forte SE still has more features than the Artis though.

<doc id="972171" wikidata="Q1246408" url="?curid=972171" title="Alcestis (play)">
<text>Alcestis (; , &quot;Alkēstis&quot;) is an Athenian tragedy by the ancient Greek playwright Euripides. It was first produced at the City Dionysia festival in 438 BC. Euripides presented it as the final part of a tetralogy of unconnected plays in the competition of tragedies, for which he won second prize; this arrangement was exceptional, as the fourth part was normally a satyr play. Its ambiguous, tragicomic tone—which may be &quot;cheerfully romantic&quot; or &quot;bitterly ironic&quot;—has earned it the label of a &quot;problem play.&quot; &quot;Alcestis&quot; is, possibly excepting the &quot;Rhesus&quot;, the oldest surviving work by Euripides, although at the time of its first performance he had been producing plays for 17 years.

==Events prior to the start of the play==
Long before the start of the play, King Admetus was granted by the Fates the privilege of living past the allotted time of his death. The Fates were persuaded to allow this by the god Apollo (who got them drunk). This unusual bargain was struck after Apollo was exiled from Olympus for a year and a day and spent the time in the service of the Thessalian king, a man renowned for his hospitality who treated Apollo well. Apollo wishes to repay Admetus&#x27; hospitality and offers him freedom from death. The gift, however, comes with a price: Admetus must find someone to take his place when Death comes to claim him.

The time of Admetus&#x27; death comes and he still has not found a willing substitute. His father, Pheres, is unwilling to step in and thinks that it is ludicrous that he should be asked to give up the life he enjoys so much as part of this strange deal. Finally, Admetus&#x27; devoted wife Alcestis agrees to be taken in his place because she wishes not to leave her children fatherless or be bereft of her lover. At the start of the play, she is close to death.

==Synopsis==
In the play&#x27;s prologue, the god Apollo comes out from Admetus&#x27; palace in Pherae (modern Velestino in Magnesia), dressed in white and carrying his golden bow, with the intention of leaving to avoid becoming stained by the imminent death of Alcestis, who is being comforted within. He offers an exposition of the events leading up to this moment. He hails the arrival of Thanatos (Death), who, dressed in black and carrying a sword, has come to the palace in his role as psychopomp to lead Alcestis to the underworld. Thanatos challenges Apollo&#x27;s apparent defense of Alcestis and accuses him of &quot;twisting slippery tricks&quot; when he helped Admetus cheat death in the first place. Apollo reassures him and, in a passage of swift stichomythic banter, proposes a postponement of Alcestis&#x27; death, which is sarcastically rebuffed. Thanatos concludes, &quot;you may not have what is not yours.&quot; Defeated, Apollo leaves angrily, prophesying the arrival of a man (Heracles) who will wrestle Alcestis away from Death. Alone with the audience, Thanatos warns that &quot;this was a god of many words; but words / are not enough,&quot; before he summons the doors open with the tip of his sword and slowly enters the palace.

The entry of the chorus, or the &quot;parodos&quot; sequence, follows: a chorus of fifteen men of Pherae, led by a &quot;coryphaeus&quot; (chorus-leader), enter the orchestra of the theatre. The chorus-leader complains that they are in a state of suspense, ignorant of whether they ought to be performing mourning rituals for their queen. The chorus&#x27; lyrical ode, to which they dance as they sing, consists of two paired stanzas of strophe and antistrophe. They sing of the silence that greets their search for signs of mourning, the evidence of Alcestis&#x27; death. &quot;When goodness dies,&quot; they lament, &quot;all good men suffer, too.&quot; The chorus-leader concludes by dismissing the chorus&#x27; search for hope in the situation: &quot;The King has exhausted every ritual.&quot;
The first episode begins with a maidservant, who enters from the palace in tears. When the chorus-leader presses her for news, she gives a confusing response: &quot;She is alive. And dead.&quot; Alcestis stands, she explains, at this moment on the brink of life and death. The chorus-leader anxiously confirms that all of the customary preparations have been made for her proper burial. The maidservant joins the chorus-leader in praising Alcestis&#x27; virtue. She narrates a long description of Alcestis&#x27; prayers and preparations to die earlier that morning, when Alcestis cried over the bridal bed that will destroy her, embraced her sobbing children, and bade all farewell. She describes how Admetus held Alcestis weeping in his arms while her eyes clung to the sight of the last rays of sun she would see. The maidservant welcomes the chorus-leader to the palace and goes inside to inform Admetus of their arrival.

Alcestis, on her death-bed, requests that in return for her sacrifice, Admetus never again marry, nor forget her or place a resentful stepmother in charge of their children. Admetus agrees to this and also promises to lead a life of solemnity in her honour, abstaining from the merrymaking that was an integral part of his household. Alcestis then dies.

Just afterwards, Admetus&#x27; old friend Heracles arrives at the palace, having no idea of the sorrow that has befallen the place. Unwilling to turn a guest away, the king decides not to burden Heracles with the sad news and instructs the servants to make him welcome and to keep their mouths shut. By doing this, Admetus breaks his promise to Alcestis to abstain from merrymaking during the period that follows her death. Heracles gets drunk and begins to irritate the servants, who loved their queen and are bitter at not being allowed to mourn her properly. Finally, one of the servants snaps at the guest and tells him what has happened.

Heracles is deeply embarrassed at his blunder and his bad behaviour and he decides to ambush and confront Death when the funerary sacrifices are made at Alcestis&#x27; tomb. When he returns, he brings with him a veiled woman whom he tells Admetus he has won in a competition. He asks his host to take her and look after her while Heracles is away on his labours. After much discussion, he finally forces a reluctant Admetus to take her by the hand, but when he lifts the veil, he finds that it appears to be Alcestis, back from the dead. Heracles has battled Death and forced him to give her up. She cannot speak for three days, after which she will be purified and fully restored to life.

==Critics&#x27; commentary==
The categorization of &quot;Alcestis&quot; has been a subject of debate among literary critics. It employs both tragic and comic elements, and (when first performed) occupied a slot that was generally reserved for satyr plays. Conacher explores how Euripides expanded the myth of Admetus and Alcestis, and added elements of comedy and folk tales. Beye also discusses legendary and fairy tale aspects of the play.

&quot;Alcestis&quot; is also a popular text for women&#x27;s studies. Critics have indicated that the play&#x27;s central focus is Admetus rather than Alcestis. Segal, for example, has written of the play&#x27;s patriarchal aspects. The nature of sacrifice, especially in ancient times, has been variously analysed by Rabinowitz, Vellacott, and Burnett, who explain that ancient Greek morality differed considerably from that of the present day. Modern interpretations of the play have been extremely varied, so much so that critics (such as Michelini and Gounaridou) have noted their failure to agree on much of anything. Gounaridou argues that Euripides meant for the play to be understood in many different ways. The psychologies and motivations of Admetus and Alcestis are especially disputed, with the question of Admetus&#x27;s selfishness strongly contested.

==Adaptations==
There are at least seven operas based on the play, six of them named &quot;Alceste&quot;: the 1674 opera by Jean-Baptiste Lully, a 1750 opera by George Frideric Handel, a 1767 opera by Christoph Willibald Gluck - famous for being published with his proposals for revising operatic composition, a 1773 opera by Anton Schweitzer, and a 1768 opera by Pietro Alessandro Guglielmi.

Rutland Boughton&#x27;s 1922 opera &quot;Alkestis&quot; is based on the Gilbert Murray translation. It was performed at Covent Garden by the British National Opera Company and was broadcast by the nascent British Broadcasting Company, both in 1924.

The American theatre director Robert Wilson staged a production of the play in 1986 at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts and in 1987 at the Staatstheater in Stuttgart. The production supplemented Euripides&#x27; play with material drawn from a range of sources, united by their exploration of the themes of death and rebirth. It began with Heiner Müller&#x27;s &quot;Explosion of a Memory (Description of a Picture)&quot; (1985) as a prologue; the piece is a dream narrative partly composed using automatic writing. Müller described it as a description of &quot;a landscape beyond death&quot; that is &quot;an overpainting of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Alcestis&quot; which quotes the Noh play &quot;Kumasaka&quot;, the Eleventh Canto of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds.&quot;&quot; The production also utilised a Japanese kyogen play whose themes parodied those of &quot;Alcestis&quot;, laser projections, a musical score by Laurie Anderson, and sound sculptures by composer Robert Rutman.

T. S. Eliot&#x27;s play &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot; is a modern adaption of &quot;Alcestis&quot;; it was premiered at the Edinburgh Festival on 22 August 1949, directed by E. Martin Browne.

<doc id="972179" wikidata="Q3075533" url="?curid=972179" title="Last Call with Carson Daly">
<text>Last Call with Carson Daly is an American late-night television series that was broadcast by NBC from 2002 to 2019. Hosted by former MTV personality Carson Daly, the series was initially formatted as a late-night talk show in line with &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Last Call&quot; abandoned its studio-based format, and was retooled as an entertainment program featuring interviews and performances (such as music and stand-up comedy) filmed on-location with Daly.

Unlike other programs in NBC&#x27;s late night lineup, &quot;Last Call&quot; typically recorded only 24 weeks of original shows a year, with the rest of the year being taken up by reruns.

In 2013, NBC announced that Daly would leave &quot;Last Call&quot; to become a correspondent for its morning show &quot;Today&quot;. Despite this, the show continued with Daly in a reduced capacity, serving only as a studio-based presenter for the segments (with interviews conducted by production staff off-camera). In February 2019, NBC announced that the show would conclude after its 2,000th and final episode, which aired on May 25, 2019. Reruns continued until mid-September, with its replacement—&quot;A Little Late with Lilly Singh&quot;—premiering in its timeslot on September 16, 2019.

==History==
===2002–2006===
&quot;Last Call&quot; premiered on January 8, 2002, as the successor to &quot;Later&quot;. &quot;Last Call&quot; initially aired Monday through Thursday until the cancellation of &quot;Late Friday&quot; in late May 2002; it was aired five nights a week since. Its premiere was delayed one day at the last minute due to a contract dispute, with a rebroadcast of SCTV airing in its place on the night it was scheduled to premiere.

&quot;Last Call&quot; was originally taped in Studio 8H of the GE Building in New York City, which was also the home studio of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. However, this required the producers to work around the schedule of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. During this phase, &quot;Last Call&quot; had no house band and no jokes or monologue, going straight to the first guest at the beginning of the show. The stage was set up in an empty black box theater style, save for two low-slung chairs and a small table. Each week, a different unsigned band was brought in to do the music, in addition to any musical act at the end. Gradually, the set acquired more furnishings and decor, much of which was influenced by the occasional week-long trips to Las Vegas. In 2003 and 2004, &quot;Last Call&quot; was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for &quot;Choice TV Show – Late Night&quot;.

&quot;Last Call&quot; was originally planned to broadcast in high-definition when Studio 8H was retrofitted for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; however, instead, the show was relocated to Los Angeles in September 2005, and continued to air in standard-definition. After the move, &quot;Last Call&quot; began to resemble its counterparts, with a more traditional set, permanent house band led by Joe Firstman, short monologue and occasional comedy bits.

In November 2005, Joe Firstman became the official house band leader for &quot;Last Call.&quot; Notable members of his band include Kamasi Washington, Thundercat, Kenny Aronoff, Mike Miley (Rival Sons), Brian Wright, Zane Musa, Zane Carney, Mark Bryan, Marc Ford, and Ryan Porter. Firstman wrote the majority of the material the band performed.

===2007===
Production of new &quot;Last Call&quot; episodes was suspended for a month due to the Writers Guild of America strike, but on December 4, 2007, &quot;Last Call&quot; became the first late night talk show to resume production during the strike. On air, Daly explained that the only reason the show resumed production was that he was given the option to either return or have the show&#x27;s 75 non-striking staff members fired. The shows were not scripted and did not include monologues. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) was critical of Daly, accusing him of crossing picket lines and labeling him a scab. Daly is not a member of the WGA.

On November 27, 2007, he was accused by the WGA of soliciting jokes for his show through a telephone hotline.

On December 11, 2007, an organized group of WGA writers attended a taping of &quot;Last Call&quot;. First, one heckled during an interview with Jerry Rice. After security removed the first writer, another spoke up disruptively, expressing sympathy with striking writers. A producer asked anyone planning to disrupt the show to leave or face prosecution; between five and twenty left.

===2009===
As the end of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; was approaching, Daly made it public that he was interested in moving to the &quot;Late Night&quot; time slot. Jimmy Fallon was chosen to replace O&#x27;Brien, a choice that executive producer Lorne Michaels had in mind dating back to the day that Fallon left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2004.

In February 2009, network executive Rick Ludwin told &quot;TV Week&quot; that the company was currently &quot;going through the budgetary process with all of our shows. There are new budgetary realities... It&#x27;s tough. We want to keep [Carson] going as long as we can make the budget work.&quot; Soon after that interview, NBC announced plans for &quot;Last Call&quot; to go on a one-week &quot;tour&quot; of California, with taped segments of up-and-coming musical acts at various clubs, such as The Roxy, The Viper Room, and Hotel Cafe. As the show&#x27;s 1000th episode approached in April, NBC&#x27;s summary of the show made it clear that the change in format would continue:
:&quot;Currently in its eighth season, NBC&#x27;s&quot; Last Call with Carson Daly &quot;utilizes a new style by introducing a documentary style format. Host Carson Daly gets out of the studio and takes the show on location each night. Recent highlights include Daly’s motorcycle trip across the historic Route 66, a visit to comedian Tom Green&#x27;s house in the Hollywood Hills, and a scene at the Whiskey Bar with the Grammy Award-winning band Kings of Leon.&quot;
With the change, the usual late-night talk show trappings of a house band, studio audience, and comedy were abandoned. In May, NBC announced that &quot;Last Call&quot; had been renewed for a ninth season, which debuted on September 21, 2009.

===2010===
On January 8, 2010, it was reported by multiple media outlets that &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; was moving to 11:35 p.m., the Conan O&#x27;Brien-hosted &quot;Tonight Show&quot; to 12:05 a.m., and &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; to 1:05, which would have resulted in &quot;Last Call&quot; losing its time slot (as NBC did not include plans to move &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;, at the time the show which followed &quot;Last Call&quot; in some markets, to a later slot). NBC confirmed the move, along with the possible end of &quot;Last Call&quot;. NBC had repeatedly emphasized that its focus is retaining the lineup of Leno, &quot;Tonight&quot; and Fallon. NBC chairman Jeff Gaspin told &quot;ABC News&quot; he expected Daly to stay with the network &quot;in some fashion&quot;, but did not elaborate.

On January 9, after the lineup changes were first rumored in the press, Daly made an unannounced stop on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, appearing from the crowd during an audience Q&amp;A session with Kimmel. Daly jokingly asked, &quot;What will happen to my show?&quot; Referencing the contestant elimination process on the show &quot;Survivor&quot;, Kimmel responded, &quot;As long as you have your immunity idol, I think you&#x27;re safe.&quot; Daly then asked, &quot;Can I have your show?&quot; Kimmel responded, &quot;No.&quot;

After O&#x27;Brien was effectively forced to leave NBC and Leno was subsequently re-installed as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Daly remained at his spot and received a 4% surge in ratings. 

On August 19, 2010, NBC and Daly confirmed that &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; would be renewed for its tenth season.

===2011===

In the May sweeps, &quot;Last Call&quot; received a 5% increase in viewership compared to the previous year. In the same month, next day encores of the series began to air as part of Fuse&#x27;s early primetime schedule.

Despite the program being filmed in widescreen since at least 2008, &quot;Last Call&quot; was still presented in a 4:3 letterboxed format until September 19, 2011, when it became the last program (outside of the network&#x27;s outside-controlled Saturday morning Qubo block at the time) on NBC&#x27;s schedule to make the full conversion to high definition. This also made it the last of the major late night talk programs on broadcast and cable to make the switch.

===2012–2019===
On April 3, 2013, NBC officially announced that Jimmy Fallon would succeed Jay Leno as the host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; following the 2014 Winter Olympics. Daly was again passed over for host of &quot;Late Night&quot; when Seth Meyers was announced as Fallon&#x27;s successor on May 12, 2013.

In September 2013, NBC announced that Daly was leaving &quot;Last Call&quot; to become the new social media correspondent for its morning show &quot;Today.&quot; Despite this, Daly remained involved in a limited capacity for the 13th season, only filming opening and closing segments for the program. All interviews were now conducted by the show&#x27;s producers off-camera.

Though there was originally talk of expanding Fallon&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; to 90 minutes which would have bumped &quot;Last Call&quot; to 2:00 a.m. or possibly have resulted in its cancellation, the change of late night time slots did not come to pass and the show&#x27;s start time remained unchanged.

===Cancellation===
The series&#x27; seventeenth season was its final season and at the time it was the longest-running late night weeknight show on American television with the same host. As part of the final season, Jameela Jamil hosted a recurring segment called &quot;Wide Awake with Jameela Jamil&quot;.

On February 12, 2019, NBC announced the series would end near the official end of the 2018–19 television season, with Daly citing his more prominent workload with &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot;, and a new project with Golf Channel in wanting to depart the series. The 2,000th and final episode of &quot;Last Call&quot; aired on May 25, 2019, with repeats continuing until September 12, 2019. On March 14, 2019, NBC announced that Canadian YouTube personality Lilly Singh would host a new talk show to replace &quot;Last Call&quot;, &quot;A Little Late with Lilly Singh&quot;.

<doc id="972181" wikidata="Q976721" url="?curid=972181" title="Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale">
<text>Hugh Cecil Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale, (25 January 1857–13 April 1944) was an English peer and sportsman. He was president of Bertram Mills Olympia Circus and a vice-president of the RSPCA.

==Early life==

Born in 1857, he was the second son of Emily Susan (), daughter of St George Francis Caulfeild of Donamon Castle of Roscommon, Ireland and Henry Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale.

In 1882, he succeeded his brother, St George Lowther, 4th Earl of Lonsdale, and was succeeded in turn by his brother, Lancelot Lowther, 6th Earl of Lonsdale upon his death in 1944.

==Career==
Lonsdale inherited enormous wealth derived from his father&#x27;s Cumberland coalmines, and owned of land. He had residences at Lowther Castle, at Whitehaven Castle, Barleythorpe and Carlton House Terrace, London.

He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the Westmorland and Cumberland Yeomanry on 3 March 1897 and from February 1900 to 1901, he was Assistant Adjutant-General for the Imperial Yeomanry during the first part of the Second Boer War. He became Honorary Colonel of the Westmorland and Cumberland Yeomanry on 16 November 1908, shortly after it had transferred to the Territorial Force. During World War I his chief role was as a recruitment officer of both men and horses. He formed his own pals battalion, the Lonsdales (11th Battalion, Border Regiment). He helped found Our Dumb Friends League (now the Blue Cross) and was its chairman during the war.

Lonsdale was known as the Yellow Earl for his penchant for the colour. He was a founder and first president of the Automobile Association (AA) which adopted his livery.

In 1907, Lonsdale was part of the famous wager with John Pierpont Morgan over whether a man could circumnavigate the globe and remain unidentified.

In August 1895 the German Emperor Wilhelm II visited Lowther Castle for some grouse shooting. The kings of Italy and Portugal later came to stay, and the Kaiser a second time in 1902. The Kaiser conferred upon the Earl a knighthood of the first class of the Order of the Prussian Crown.

Although he was a Peer, he was rarely seen in the House of Lords. Because of his extravagance he was forced to sell some of his inherited properties. In 1921 Whitehaven Castle was sold, and in 1926 Barleythorpe. The same year the west Cumberland coalmines closed. In 1935 he moved from Lowther Castle because he could no longer afford to live there and moved to much smaller accommodation.

His free-spending had largely wrecked the estate, and his heir, his brother Lancelot, the 6th Earl was forced to auction off the contents of Lowther Castle in 1947. This proved to be the largest English country house sale of the 20th century.

==Personal life==
In 1878, before obtaining his inheritance, Lonsdale married Lady Grace Cecilie Gordon, third daughter of Maria Antoinetta Pegus (c. 1821–1893) and Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly. Her family opposed the marriage as Lonsdale was not then wealthy and seemed irresponsible. This proved to be correct as the following year he invested in cattle in America; the venture collapsed and the Lowther family was forced to save him.

The couple then lived at Barleythorpe Hall near Oakham. Grace became pregnant but had a miscarriage after a fall while hunting. After this she was unable to bear children and remained a partial invalid for the rest of her life. She died in 1941.

After an affair with the actress Violet Cameron caused a scandal, Lonsdale set out in 1888 to explore the Arctic regions of Canada as far north as Melville Island, nearly dying before reaching Kodiak, Alaska in 1889 and returning to England. His collection of Inuit artefacts that he assembled during his explorations in Alaska and north-west Canada at this time is now in the British Museum.

Lonsdale died in 1944 at Stud House, Barleythorpe, aged 87.

===Sports===
Lonsdale was a founding member and first president of the National Sporting Club, and donated the original Lonsdale Belts in 1909 for the boxing championship trophy. His name was later given to the Lonsdale clothing brand of boxing garments and the Lonsdale cigar size.

He was also a director of Arsenal Football Club and served as chairman for a brief period in 1936, and later became the club&#x27;s honorary president.
After the First World War, Hugh gave up hunting and became more involved with race horses. He became a senior steward of the Jockey Club. He had two major wins with his colt Royal Lancer in 1922, the St Leger and the Irish St Leger. He was also the first president of the International Horse Show at Olympia.

From 1929 Lonsdale was the joint editor of the &quot;Lonsdale Library of Sports, Games and Pastimes&quot;, a book series published by Seeley, Service and Co.

==Views on animals==

Lonsdale enjoyed foxhunting, serving as Master of the Quorn from 1893 to 1898 and of the Cottesmore Hunt for long periods. In the 1920s, Lonsdale frequently attended circus animal training sessions. He defended Bertram Mills&#x27; use of circus animals against allegations of cruelty. He was president of Mills Olympia Circus.

He was a vice-president of the RSPCA which caused controversy amongst some RSPCA members due to his support of performance animals. Stephen Coleridge for example called for his resignation. However, the council of the RSPCA noted that membership &quot;does not compel the adoption of any particular policy in regard to matters not yet included within the scope of animal protection acts&quot; and did not request for Lonsdale to resign.

Lonsdale was president of Our Dumb Friends&#x27; League for 20 years. His re-election in 1924 was controversial due to his support of the rodeo and he was booed at the annual meeting in Westminster. Annie Bradshaw and Lady Lumb opposed his re-election. Lonsdale resigned in 1930.

==In popular culture==
Lonsdale was the subject of a biography by Douglas Sutherland.

<text>Sky City was a regional chain of discount stores, based in Asheville, North Carolina. The store&#x27;s name was a reference to the &quot;Land of the Sky,&quot; a nickname for the city of Asheville that was popularized in the 20th century.

Sky City was founded in 1962 by retail executive M.C. Peterson as an evolution of Bowers department stores, a regional chain founded in 1919 in Knoxville, Tennessee. Peterson became president of Bowers stores in 1948 and relocated its headquarters to Asheville that same year. Peterson&#x27;s concept for the first Sky City store was to provide a suburban alternative to the urban department store experience by selling discounted name-brand merchandise in a self-service, multi-department store that offered plentiful free parking. The concept was so popular with Asheville shoppers that, by 1963, Peterson had to double the size of Sky City&#x27;s Asheville flagship store. In 1964, a second location was opened in Hickory, and a third location was opened in High Point in 1965.

In 1977, Sky City merged with Interco, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri, but remained an autonomous operating entity with its headquarters in Asheville. By 1982, the chain spanned five Southeastern states with more than 70 locations. However, by the late 1980s, the retailer began to falter. Parent company Interco, Inc. had taken on debts from fighting a hostile takeover bid in 1988. Also, despite generating sales of $140 million in 1990–up from $120 million the previous year–the retailer faced heated competition in the Southeast trading area from discount retailer Wal-Mart, which first entered Sky City&#x27;s home base of North Carolina in the late 1980s, as well as Rose&#x27;s Department Store and Kmart stores.

In 1990, 20 of the chain&#x27;s 55 Southeastern stores were shuttered as part of a restructuring of Sky City operations. Remaining stores in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia underwent a remodeling and a program to beef up in-store inventory levels. The shuttered locations included nine stores in North Carolina, five stores each in Georgia and South Carolina, and one in Tennessee. Employees at these shuttered locations were relocated to the remaining stores whenever possible. At the time, Harvey Yellen, Sky City Stores&#x27; chief executive officer, noted that it was possible that some of the closed stores could be reopened at a later date.

In 1991, Interco, Inc. sold Sky City Stores, Inc. to a group of investors, headed by Yellen, for an undisclosed figure. The investment group formed a new company, Sky City Holding Corp. The new company included a Hong Kong–based global trading firm called Asia Pacific Industries. The infusion of capital from Asia Pacific Industries and other members of the holding company allowed for five new store openings in 1991–each conforming to the chain&#x27;s new, prototype size–plus the development of new corporate offices, a warehouse, and a distribution center in Asheville.

John B. Owens, director of stores and operations with Sky City, said the prototype was designed to serve small communities. Stores typically ranged in size from to . Also, Owens said the chain planned to increase the percentage of merchandise that resulted from opportunistic buys to better compete with retailers like Wal-Mart. Sky City was set to open its first test prototype in March 1991.

However, in January 1991, Yellen abruptly announced that all remaining Sky City stores had closed. Approximately 1,000 employees were affected, with some being rehired by liquidation firms to catalog and remove merchandise from store locations.

<text>Fradley Junction () is a canal junction between Fradley and Alrewas near Lichfield, Staffordshire, England and the point at which the Coventry Canal joins the Trent and Mersey Canal. It opened in 1790, and several of the buildings around it, including The Swan public house, are grade II listed structures.

==History==
The Trent and Mersey Canal, at the time called the Grand Trunk Canal, was conceived as a link between Liverpool and Kingston upon Hull, although it followed a rather circuitous route, passing through the Potteries and Cheshire. It was authorised by an act of Parliament, the Trent and Mersey Canal Act 1766
(6 Geo. 3. c. 96), and the route from Derwent Mouth to Preston Brook was completed in eleven years, opening in 1777.

The Coventry canal was authorised two years after the Trent and Mersey, in 1768, and should have run from Coventry, via Bedworth and Atherstone, to join the Grand Trunk Canal at Fradley. The first to Bedworth were completed in 1769, and a lucrative trade in coal soon developed between the Bedworth collieries and Coventry. The canal was completed to Atherstone in 1771, but the next stage involved a flight of eleven locks, and the money had run out. Consequently, construction stopped at Atherstone, some from Fradley.

No more progress was made until 1782, when the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was being proposed. The promoters wanted to ensure that it would be profitable if it was built, and this depended on it being part of a larger network, which would generated long-distance traffic. They therefore negotiated with the Oxford Canal, who agreed to complete their line to join the River Thames at Oxford, and hence open up the route to London. Negotiations with the Coventry Canal were a little more complex, and the final solution involved the Coventry Canal building of canal, including the flight of eleven locks and two more at Glascote, to meet with the proposed canal at Fazeley Junction. The Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and the Trent and Mersey Canal would then build half each of the final to link Fazeley Junction to Fradley, following the line authorised by the Coventry Canal Act 1768 (8 Geo. 3. c. 36). The Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was authorised in 1784, and work began. It was completed in 1789, and the network, including Fradley Junction, was operational by the following year.

Although the junction and the canal to the south of it was built by the Trent and Mersey Canal company, the Coventry Canal later bought it back from them, and so it is indeed a junction between the Trent and Mersey and the Coventry canals, although the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal retained control of their section, and so the historic Coventry Canal is in two parts.

The canalside settlement at Fradley Junction was established after the link was completed in 1790. Fradley was a major junction on the Victorian canal network. Both the Trent &amp; Mersey and the Coventry Canal companies built houses and cottages for their workers, while two warehouses, complete with hoists, were erected at Junction Row alongside the Swan public house.

==Location==

On the Trent and Mersey, the junction is in the middle of a five-lock flight, with Junction Lock just below it and Middle Lock a little further above it. On the Coventry Canal, the pound is level to Fazeley Junction and beyond. Huddlesford Junction where the Wyrley and Essington Canal joined the Coventry Canal is away. It closed in 1954, but may be reopened, as the closed section, now renamed the Lichfield Canal is the subject of an active restoration campaign. At is Whittington Brook, where the waterway is officially part of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. The canal remains level for another to Fazeley Junction, and for a further along the Birmingham and Fazeley to Curdworth Bottom Lock or along the Coventry Canal to Glascote Bottom Lock.

A small settlement, popular with gongoozlers and other visitors, has developed there including the Swan Inn, two shops and two cafes. Fradley Pool Nature Reserve is adjacent to the junction, and is named after the local village of Fradley approximately a mile away.

British Waterways have an office there which can advise on mooring and other boating services. The Swan, together with an attached warehouse, both of which date from the 1770s, and an attached cottage dating from the late nineteenth century form a group and are grade II listed structures. Junction Lock and Middle Lock are both in nearly original condition, apart from modern gates, and are listed structures, as are a terrace of three workers cottages dating from the early nineteenth century, the mid-nineteenth century wharf house and a range of red-brick workshops dating from 1872.

<doc id="972201" wikidata="Q1111191" url="?curid=972201" title="Communist Party of Ireland">
<text>The Communist Party of Ireland (CPI) is a Marxist–Leninist party, founded in 1970 and active in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland following a merger of the Irish Workers&#x27; Party and the Communist Party of Northern Ireland. It rarely contests elections and has never had electoral success. The party is a member of the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties. Throughout the period of the Cold War, the CPI openly aligned with the Soviet Union. During the Troubles, the party procured some arms for the faction which became the Official IRA. The party closely supported the Cuban Revolution and campaigns such as the Birmingham Six. Minor splits from the CPI included the Eurocommunist-inspired Irish Marxist Society.

==History==
===1970s and 1980s===
The Communist Party of Ireland formed in 1970 following a merger of the Irish Workers&#x27; Party and the Communist Party of Northern Ireland. Michael O&#x27;Riordan, a member of the Communist Party of Ireland (1933), became general secretary and would remain in that role until 1983. In March 1970, following the CPNI/IWP merger, the new Communist Party of Ireland issued a manifesto called &quot;For Unity and Socialism&quot;, advocating the election of left-wing governments in both parts of Ireland, and, eventually, the creation of a United Ireland.

One notable split from the CPI was the Eurocommunist group the Irish Marxist Society, which left the CPI around 1976. The IMS was founded by Joe Deasy (1922–2013), Sam Nolan (1930-), Paddy Carmody, George Jeffares, Mick O&#x27;Reilly (1946-) and other former CPI members. The IMS advocated Marxist feminism and was also outspoken in its rejection of the two nations theory of Northern Ireland. Most of the IMS&#x27;s members later joined the Irish Labour Party, where they played a leading role in the formation of Labour Left.

The CPI strongly criticised the Anglo-Irish Agreement, claiming the AIA &quot;underlined Partition and gave Britain a direct say in the affairs of the Republic&quot;. In the 1980s, its membership declined significantly during the electoral rise of the Workers&#x27; Party and this trend continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The party&#x27;s aim is to win the support of the majority of the Irish people for ending the capitalist system and for building socialism. It is actively opposed to neo-liberalism and to the European Union.

Autobiographical accounts of the party in this period have been written by Mick O&#x27;Reilly, Helena Sheehan and Kevin McMahon.

===2010s and 2020s===
The party stood two candidates in the 2014 local elections, neither was elected. The CPI fielded one candidate for the 2016 Dáil Éireann election for the Cork North-West constituency.

In January 2021, the Connolly Youth Movement dropped its support for the programme of the CPI. In February, the CPI issued a statement stating that several dual (CPI-CYM) members had been expelled for severe breaches of discipline and factional behaviour within the CPI prior to the CYM&#x27;s decision to drop its support for the programme of the CPI.

On 2 June 2021, the CPI released a statement distancing itself from its former Belfast branch due to the actions of former party members in the city. The statement also announced the founding of a new Greater Belfast branch to replace the Belfast branch and noted that the branch&#x27;s social media pages and &quot;Unity&quot; newspaper were still in the hands of the former members of the Belfast branch.

After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the party called for an immediate ceasefire and political solution to bring about a &quot;demilitarised, neutral Ukraine&quot;, saying it was an &quot;inter-imperialist war&quot;. The CPI opposes the Ukrainian Government, stating the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution was a US-backed &quot;coup&quot;. The CPI blamed the war on &quot;the expansion of NATO&quot;, stating it had built up &quot;large bases of troops and mass destructive weapons along [Russia&#x27;s] western and southern borders&quot;. When it was announced the Irish Defence Forces would train Ukraine&#x27;s military in mine clearing, the CPI condemned this as &quot;collaboration of the Irish political establishment in the NATO-EU strategy to escalate and prolong the war in Ukraine&quot;.

In 2022, a group seceded from the CPI, citing &quot;political and organisational issues&quot;, with the name &quot;Irish Communist Party&quot;. It claims to be a successor to the CPI, stating that an &quot;opportunistic and anti-democratic faction&quot; had taken control of the party. The interim National Chairperson is Eoin Ó Murchú.

==Organisation and activity==
The general secretary of the party is Jimmy Corcoran. The CPI publishes a monthly magazine called &quot;Socialist Voice&quot;. There are also branches in Cork, Galway, Munster, and Mid-Ulster.

While it is a registered party, the CPI has rarely run candidates in elections and has never had electoral success. The CPI operates a bookshop in Dublin called Connolly Books, which is named after the Irish socialist James Connolly.

The party and its members are prominent in a number of campaigns such as advocating a &quot;No&quot; vote in the Lisbon Treaty referendums. The party has also advocated a referendum on the Irish bailout of banks. It also continues to oppose the European Union and membership of the euro currency. The CPI set up the Repudiate The Debt campaign to further this objective. In the 2010s, the CPI was active in Right2Water Ireland and called for a constitutional amendment to enshrine ownership of water in the hands of the Irish people and not the state. The party also supported the anti-war movement in Ireland as part of the Peace and Neutrality Alliance.

In November 2017, the Standards in Public Office Commission stated that some statements of accounts had been received from the CPI, but they were found not to be compliant because the accounts were not audited. It decided against appointing a public auditor as the CPI did not receive any funding from the exchequer.

<text>The Washington Star, previously known as the Washington Star-News and the Washington Evening Star, was a daily afternoon newspaper published in Washington, D.C., between 1852 and 1981. The Sunday edition was known as the Sunday Star. The paper was renamed several times before becoming &quot;Washington Star&quot; by the late 1970s. 

For most of the time it was publishing, &quot;The Washington Star&quot; was the city&#x27;s newspaper of record and the longtime home to columnist Mary McGrory and cartoonist Clifford K. Berryman. On August 7, 1981, after 128 years, &quot;The Washington Star&quot; ceased publication and filed for bankruptcy. In the bankruptcy sale, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; purchased the land and buildings owned by &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, including its printing presses.

== History ==
===19th century===

&quot;The Washington Star&quot; was founded on December 16, 1852, by Captain Joseph Borrows Tate. It was originally headquartered on &quot;Newspaper Row&quot; on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Tate initially named the paper The Daily Evening Star.

In 1853, Texas surveyor and newspaper entrepreneur William Douglas Wallach purchased the paper, and in 1854 shortened the name to &quot;The Evening Star&quot; and introduced &quot;The Sunday Star&quot; edition. As the sole owner of the paper for 14 years, Wallach built up the paper by capitalizing on reporting of the American Civil War, among other things. In 1867, a three-man consortium of Crosby Stuart Noyes, Samuel H. Kauffmann and George W. Adams acquired the paper, with each of the investors putting up $33,333.33. The Noyes-Kauffmann-Adams interests would own the paper for the next four generations.

===20th century===

In 1907, subsequent Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist Clifford K. Berryman joined the &quot;Star&quot;. Berryman was most famous for his 1902 cartoon of President Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt, &quot;Drawing the Line in Mississippi,&quot; which spurred the creation of the teddy bear. During his career, Berryman drew thousands of cartoons commenting on American Presidents and politics. Presidential figures included former Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman. The cartoons satirized both Democrats and Republicans and covered topics such as drought, farm relief, and food prices; representation of the District of Columbia in Congress; labor strikes and legislation; campaigning and elections; political patronage; European coronations; the America&#x27;s Cup; and the atomic bomb. Berryman&#x27;s career continued at the &quot;Star&quot; until he collapsed on the lobby floor one morning in 1949 and died shortly after of a heart ailment.

The next major change to the newspaper came in 1938, when the three owning families diversified their interests. On May 1, the &quot;Star&quot; purchased the M. A. Leese Radio Corporation and acquired Washington&#x27;s oldest radio station, WMAL, in the process. Renamed the Evening Star Broadcasting Company, the 1938 acquisition would figure later in the 1981 demise of the newspaper.

The &quot;Star&quot;″s influence and circulation peaked in the 1950s; it constructed a new printing plant in Southeast Washington capable of printing millions of copies, but found itself unable to cope with changing times. Nearly all top editorial and business staff jobs were held by members of the owning families, including a Kauffmann general manager who had gained a reputation for anti-Semitism, driving away advertisers. Suburbanization and competition with television news were other factors for declining circulation and staffing; Carl Bernstein reflected in his 2021 memoir that the &quot;Star&quot; &quot;couldn&#x27;t get the paper out to the newer postwar suburbs until late in the afternoon&quot; because &quot;delivery trucks got tied up in rush hour traffic.&quot;

Meanwhile, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; acquired and merged with its morning rival, the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot;, in 1954 and steadily drew readers and advertisers away from the falling &quot;Star&quot;. By the 1960s, the &quot;Post&quot; was Washington&#x27;s leading newspaper.

In 1972, the &quot;Star&quot; purchased and absorbed one of Washington&#x27;s few remaining competing newspapers, &quot;The Washington Daily News.&quot; For a short period of time after the merger, both &quot;The Evening Star&quot; and &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot; mastheads appeared on the front page. The paper soon was retitled &quot;Washington Star News&quot; and finally, &quot;The Washington Star&quot; by the late 1970s.

In 1973, the &quot;Star&quot; was targeted for clandestine purchase by interests close to the South African Apartheid government in its propaganda war, in what became known as the Muldergate Scandal. The &quot;Star&quot;, whose editorial policy had always been conservative, was seen as favorable to South Africa at the time. In 1974, pro-apartheid Michigan newspaper publisher John P. McGoff attempted to purchase &quot;The Washington Star&quot; for $25 million, but he and his family received death threats, and the sale did not go through.

In early 1975, the Noyes-Kauffmann-Adams group sold its interests in the paper to Joe Allbritton, a Texas multimillionaire who was known as a corporate turnaround artist. Allbritton, who also owned Riggs Bank, then the most prestigious bank in the capital, planned to use profits from WMAL-AM-FM-TV to shore up the newspaper&#x27;s finances. The Federal Communications Commission stymied him with rules on media cross-ownership, however. The FCC had recently banned common ownership of newspapers and broadcast outlets, while grandfathering existing clusters. Due to the manner in which Allbritton&#x27;s takeover was structured, the FCC considered it to be an ownership change, and stripped the WMAL stations of their grandfathered protection. Allbritton sold off all of the Star Company&#x27;s radio stations in 1977, and channel 7 was renamed WJLA-TV.

On October 1, 1975, press operators at the &quot;Post&quot; went on strike, severely damaging all printing presses before leaving the building. Allbritton would not assist Katharine Graham, the owner of the &quot;Post&quot;, in any way, refusing to print his rival&#x27;s papers on the &quot;Star&quot;&#x27;s presses, since that likely would have caused the &quot;Star&quot; to be struck by the press operators as well. Allbritton also had major disagreements with editor Jim Bellows over editorial policy; Bellows left the &quot;Star&quot; for the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot;. Unable to make the &quot;Star&quot; profitable, Allbritton explored other options, including a joint operating agreement with the &quot;Post&quot;.

On February 2, 1978, Allbritton sold the &quot;Star&quot; to Time Inc. for $20 million. Their flagship magazine, &quot;Time&quot;, was the arch-rival to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, which The Washington Post Company had owned since 1961. Time Inc.&#x27;s president, James R. Shepley, convinced &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s board of directors that owning a daily newspaper in the national capital would bring a unique sense of prestige and political access. The paper&#x27;s labor unions agreed to work concessions that Shepley demanded.

An effort to draw readers with localized special &quot;zonal&quot; metro news sections, however, did little to help circulation. The &quot;Star&quot; lacked the resources to produce the sort of ultra-local coverage zonal editions demanded and ended up running many of the same regional stories in all of its local sections. An economic downturn resulted in monthly losses of over $1 million. Overall, the &quot;Star&quot; lost some $85 million following the acquisition before Time&#x27;s board decided to give up. On August 7, 1981, after 128 years, &quot;The Washington Star&quot; ceased publication. In the bankruptcy sale, the &quot;Post&quot; purchased the land and buildings owned by the &quot;Star&quot;, including its printing presses.

Many of the people who worked for the &quot;Star&quot; went to work for the newly formed &quot;Washington Times&quot;, which began operations in May 1982, almost a year after the &quot;Star&quot; went out of business.

Writers who worked at the &quot;Star&quot; in its last days included Michael Isikoff, Howard Kurtz, Fred Hiatt, Jane Mayer, Chris Hanson, Jeremiah O&#x27;Leary, Chuck Conconi, Crispin Sartwell, Maureen Dowd, novelist Randy Sue Coburn, Michael DeMond Davis, Lance Gay, Jules Witcover, Jack Germond, Judy Bachrach, Lyle Denniston, Fred Barnes, Gloria Borger, Kate Sylvester, and Mary McGrory. The paper&#x27;s staff also included editorial cartoonist Pat Oliphant from 1976 to 1981.

== Washington Star Syndicate ==
The Washington Star Syndicate operated from 1965 to 1979. The newspaper had sporadically syndicated material over the years — for instance, Gibson &quot;Gib&quot; Crockett, a &quot;Washington Star&quot; editorial cartoonist, was syndicated from 1947 to 1967 — but didn&#x27;t become official until May 1965, when it purchased the remaining comic strips, columns, and features of the George Matthew Adams Service (Adams had died in 1962).

The Washington Star Syndicate distributed the columns of James Beard, William F. Buckley Jr., James J. Kilpatrick, and Mary McGrory, among others. It began by syndicating a few strips — including Edwina Dumm&#x27;s strips &quot;Alec the Great&quot; and &quot;Cap Stubbs and Tippie&quot; — it had inherited from the Adams Service; one successful strip the syndicate launched was Morrie Brickman&#x27;s &quot;The Small Society&quot;, which was published in over 300 papers, including 35 foreign publications. Otherwise, from about 1971 onward, the syndicate no longer distributed comic strips.

In February 1978, the Washington Star Syndicate was sold (along with its parent company) to Time Inc. In May 1979, the Universal Press Syndicate acquired the Star Syndicate from the remaining assets of the Washington Star Company. As a result of this merger, beginning in June 1979, popular existing Universal Press strips like &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, &quot;Cathy&quot;, and &quot;Tank McNamara&quot; left the pages of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and began appearing in &quot;The Washington Star&quot;. (When the &quot;Star&quot; folded in August 1981, those strips returned to the &quot;Post&quot;.)
