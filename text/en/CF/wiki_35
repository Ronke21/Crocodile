<text>Grootfontein (, named after the nearby hot springs) is a city with 26,839 inhabitants in the Otjozondjupa Region of central Namibia. It is one of the three towns in the Otavi Triangle, situated on the B8 national road that leads from Otavi to the Caprivi Strip.

==Overview==
The place was known to the Herero under the name &quot;Otjivanda&quot;. In 1885, 40 Boer families from the north-west of South Africa settled at Grootfontein. Part of the Dorsland trekkers, they were heading towards Angola. When that territory fell under Portuguese control, they turned back and established the Republic of Upingtonia at Grootfontein. Abandoned by 1887, it became the headquarters of the South West Africa Company in 1893.

In 1908 the Roman Catholic church established a mission in Grootfontein as the basis of their eventually successful attempt to establish missions in Kavango.

Like all the towns in the Otavi Triangle, Grootfontein is green in summer but drier in winter. In spring, jacaranda and flamboyant trees bloom in profusion. The town has an old German Schutztruppe fortress from the year 1896, which today houses a museum that expounds on the local history. The economic mainspring of the area were for many decades the Berg Aukas and Abenab mines to the north east of the town. These produced zinc and vanadium but have since closed. Namibia is a dolomite country and the carbonate deposits in the upper parts of the mine have yielded interesting fossils of simian or pongoid creatures that lived millions of years before modern humans evolved.

Twenty four kilometres west of Grootfontein lies the huge Hoba meteorite. At over 60 tons, it is the largest known meteorite on Earth, as well as the largest naturally occurring mass of iron known to exist on the planet&#x27;s surface.
==Economy and infrastructure==
===Transport===

Grootfontein is a railhead on TransNamib, the national railway and transport system. The next station to the west is Otavi. Grootfontein is also home of Namibia&#x27;s main military base which housed several units of the now departed South African Defence Force. 

It has an airfield that can handle large transport carriers such as the Hercules C130, as well as commercial passenger aircraft.

===Agriculture===
&quot;The Grootfontein Show&quot;, an annual agricultural exhibition that has taken place since 1911, is the second largest annual entrepreneurial exhibition in the country, after the Windhoek Show.

== Climate ==
Grootfontein receives an annual average rainfall of , with a high of in the 2010/2011 rainy season, and a low of during the 2010s drought in 2018/19.

The town has a hot semi arid climate (Koppen:BSh). 

==Politics==
Grootfontein is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats.

The 2015 local authority election was won by Namibia&#x27;s ruling SWAPO party which gained five seats and 2,019 votes. One seat each went to the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 546 votes) and to the All People&#x27;s Party (APP, 154 votes). SWAPO also won the 2020 local authority election, obtaining 1,727 votes and gaining four seats. The Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, obtained 653 votes and gained two seats. The remaining seat went to the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM, the new name of the DTA) with 309 votes.

==Education==
Previously the German school &quot;Regierungsschule Grootfontein&quot; had been in Grootfonten. In 1965 it had 4 teachers and 117 learners and was supported by the German government.

Nowadays, Grootfontein is home to four high schools, Grootfontein Secondary School, Otjiwanda High School Friedrich Awaseb Senior Secondary School, and a private school named Karstveld Academy. Further the primary schools Luiperdheuwel, Kalenga, Makalani, Omulunga and Wilhelm Nortier are located here. The city also hosts a private German medium primary school (&quot;Deutsche Privatschule Grootfontein&quot; - DPG).

<doc id="950012" wikidata="Q949350" url="?curid=950012" title="Coupling (physics)">
<text>In physics, &lt;dfn&gt;two objects are said &lt;/dfn&gt;to be coupled when they are interacting with each other. In classical mechanics, coupling is a connection between two oscillating systems, such as pendulums connected by a spring. The connection affects the oscillatory pattern of both objects. In particle physics, &lt;dfn&gt;two particles are coupled &lt;/dfn&gt;if they are connected by &lt;dfn&gt;one of the four &lt;/dfn&gt;fundamental forces.

==Wave mechanics==

=== Coupled harmonic oscillator ===

If two waves are able to transmit energy to each other, then these waves are said to be &quot;coupled.&quot; This normally occurs when the waves share a common component. An example of this is two pendulums connected by a spring. If the pendulums are identical, then their equations of motion are given by
formula_1
formula_2

These equations represent the simple harmonic motion of the pendulum with an added coupling factor of the spring. This behavior is also seen in certain molecules (such as CO2 and H2O), wherein two of the atoms will vibrate around a central one in a similar manner.

=== Coupled LC circuits ===

In LC circuits, charge oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor and can therefore be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator. When the magnetic flux from &lt;dfn&gt;one inductor is able &lt;/dfn&gt;to affect the inductance of an inductor in an unconnected LC circuit, the circuits are said to be coupled. The coefficient of coupling k defines how closely the &lt;dfn&gt;two circuits are coupled&lt;/dfn&gt; and is given by the equation
formula_3
where M is the mutual inductance of the circuits and Lp and Ls are the inductances of the primary and secondary circuits, respectively. If the flux lines of the primary inductor thread every line of the secondary one, then the coefficient of coupling is 1 and formula_4 In practice, however, there is of&lt;dfn&gt;ten leakage&lt;/dfn&gt;, so most systems are not perfectly coupled.

==Chemistry==
=== Spin-spin coupling ===
Spin-spin coupling occurs when the magnetic field of &lt;dfn&gt;one atom affects the &lt;/dfn&gt;magnetic field of another nearby atom. This is very common in NMR imaging. If the atoms are not coupled, then there will be &lt;dfn&gt;two individual peaks&lt;/dfn&gt;, known as a doublet, representing the individual atoms. If coupling is present, then there will be a triplet, &lt;dfn&gt;one larger peak with two smaller ones to &lt;/dfn&gt;either side. This occurs due to the spins of the individual atoms oscillating in tandem.

==Astrophysics==

Objects in space which are coupled to each other are under the mutual influence of each other&#x27;s gravity. For instance, the Earth is coupled to both the Sun and the Moon, as it is under the gravitational influence of both. Common in space are binary systems, two objects gravitationally coupled to each other. Examples of this are binary stars which circle each other. Multiple objects may also be coupled to each other simultaneously, such as with globular clusters and galaxy groups. When smaller particles, such as dust, which are coupled together over time accumulate into much larger objects, accretion is occurring. This is the major process by which stars and planets form.

==Plasma==
The coupling constant of a plasma is given by the ratio of its average Coulomb-interaction energy to its average kinetic energy—or how strongly the electric force of each atom holds the plasma together. Plasmas can therefore be categorized into weakly- and strongly-coupled plasmas depending upon the value of this ratio. Many of the typical classical plasmas, such as the plasma in the solar corona, are weakly coupled, while the plasma in a white dwarf star is an example of a strongly coupled plasma.

== Quantum mechanics ==
Two coupled quantum systems can be modeled by a Hamiltonian of the form
formula_5
which is the addition of the two Hamiltonians in isolation with an added interaction factor. In most simple systems, formula_6 and formula_7 can be solved exactly while formula_8 can be solved through perturbation theory. If the two systems have similar total energy, then the system may undergo Rabi oscillation.

=== Angular momentum coupling ===
When angular momenta from two separate sources interact with each other, they are said to be coupled. For example, two electrons orbiting around the same nucleus may have coupled angular momenta. Due to the conservation of angular momentum and the nature of the angular momentum operator, the total angular momentum is always the sum of the individual angular momenta of the electrons, or
formula_9
Spin-Orbit interaction (also known as spin-orbit coupling) is a special case of angular momentum coupling. Specifically, it is the interaction between the intrinsic spin of a particle, S, and its orbital angular momentum, L. As they are both forms of angular momentum, they must be conserved. Even if energy is transferred between the two, the total angular momentum, J, of the system must be constant, formula_10.

== Particle physics and quantum field theory ==

Particles which interact with each other are said to be coupled. This interaction is caused by one of the fundamental forces, whose strengths are usually given by a dimensionless coupling constant. In quantum electrodynamics, this value is known as the fine-structure constant α, approximately equal to 1/137. For quantum chromodynamics, the constant changes with respect to the distance between the particles. This phenomenon is known as &quot;asymptotic freedom.&quot; Forces which have a coupling constant greater than 1 are said to be &quot;strongly coupled&quot; while those with constants less than 1 are said to be &quot;weakly coupled.&quot;

<text>Pyritinol also called pyridoxine disulfide or pyrithioxine (European drug names Encephabol, Encefabol, Cerbon 6) is a semi-synthetic water-soluble analog of vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine HCl). It was produced in 1961 by Merck Laboratories by bonding 2 vitamin B6 compounds (pyridoxine) together with a disulfide bridge. Since the 1970s, it has been a prescription and OTC drug in several countries for cognitive disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and learning disorders in children. Since the early 1990s it has been sold as a nootropic dietary supplement in the United States.

== Availability ==
It is approved for &quot;symptomatic treatment of chronically impaired brain function in dementia syndromes&quot; and for &quot;supportive treatment of sequelae of craniocerebral trauma&quot; in various European countries, including Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, and Greece. In France it is also approved for rheumatoid arthritis as a disease modifying drug, on the basis of the results of clinical trials. In many countries it is available over the counter and is widely advertised on the internet as being for &quot;memory disturbances.&quot;

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse effects include nausea, headache, and rarely allergic reaction (mild skin reactions). A 2004 survey of six case reports suggested a link between pyritinol and severe cholestatic hepatitis when on several drugs for certain diseases.

Other rare side effects: acute pancreatitis and photoallergic eruption.

<doc id="950018" wikidata="Q56234" url="?curid=950018" title="Beothuk language">
<text>Beothuk ( or ), also called Beothukan, is an extinct language once spoken by the indigenous Beothuk people of Newfoundland. The Beothuk have been extinct since 1829, and there are few written accounts of their language. Hence, little is known about it, with practically no structural data existing for Beothuk.

==Classification==
Claims of links with the neighbouring Algonquian language family date back at least to Robert Gordon Latham in 1862. From 1968 onwards, John Hewson has put forth evidence of sound correspondences and shared morphology with Proto-Algonquian and other better-documented Algonquian languages. If this is valid, Beothuk would be an extremely divergent member of the family.

Other researchers claimed that proposed similarities are more likely the result of borrowing than cognates. The limited and poor nature of the documentation means there is not enough evidence to draw strong conclusions. Owing to this overall lack of meaningful evidence, Ives Goddard and Lyle Campbell claim that any connections between Beothuk and Algonquian are unknown and likely unknowable.

==Recorded song==
In 1910, American anthropologist Frank Speck recorded a 74-year-old native woman named Santu Toney singing a song purported to be in the language. The recording resurfaced at the very end of the 20th century. Some sources give the year 1929, but the 1910 date is confirmed in Speck&#x27;s book &quot;Beothuk and Micmac&quot; (New York 1922, p. 67). The words are hard to hear and not understood. Santu said she had been taught the song by her father, which may be evidence that one person with a Beothuk connection was alive after the death of Shanawdithit in 1829 since Santu Toney was born about 1835). Contemporary researchers have tried to make a transcription of the song and to clean up the recording with modern methods. Native groups have learned the song.

James P. Howley, Director of the Geological Survey of Newfoundland, who for more than forty years was interested in the history of the Beothuk, doubted (in 1914) the truthfulness of Santu Toney.

==Vocabulary==
Beothuk is known only from several wordlists from the 18th and the 19th centuries by George C. Pulling (1792), Rev. John Clinch, Rev. John Leigh, and Hercules Robinson (1834). They contain more than 400 words that had been collected from speakers such as Oubee, Demasduit, and Shanawdithit, but there were no examples of connected speech. Wordlists had also been collected by W. E. Cormack (who worked with Shanawdithit), Richard King (whose wordlist had been passed on to Robert Gordon Latham), and James P. Howley (1915) (who worked with Jure, a widow from the islands of the Bay of Exploits).

The lack of any systematic or consistent representation of the vocabulary in the wordlists makes it daunting to establish the sound system of Beothuk, and words that are listed separately on the lists may be the same word transcribed in different ways. Moreover, the lists are known to have many mistakes. That, along with the lack of connected speech leaves little upon which to build any reconstruction of Beothuk.

===Combined lists===
The wordlists have been transcribed and analyzed in Hewson (1978). The combined Beothuk wordlists below have been reproduced from Hewson (1978: 149–167).

<doc id="950022" wikidata="Q7080745" url="?curid=950022" title="Ohio Attorney General">
<text>The Ohio attorney general is the chief legal officer of the state of Ohio in the United States. The office is filled by general election, held every four years. The Ohio attorney general is Republican Dave Yost.

==History==
The office of the attorney general was first created by the Ohio General Assembly by statute in 1846. The attorney general&#x27;s principal duties were to give legal advice to the state government, to represent the state in legal matters, and to advise the state&#x27;s county prosecutors. Originally, the attorney general was appointed by the legislature. With the adoption of Ohio&#x27;s second constitution in 1851, the attorney general became an elected office. The attorney general&#x27;s duties were drawn very generally at that time.

In 1952, the General Assembly passed a statute that added to the attorney general&#x27;s responsibilities, including trusteeship over charitable trusts, and legal advice to more government agencies. The act stated that the attorney general could prosecute individuals only if the governor requested so in writing. Starting in 1954, the term of office was increased from two years to four years.

In 2008 Nancy H. Rogers was appointed following the resignation of Marc Dann. A special election was held in 2008 to find a permanent replacement; then–Ohio State Treasurer Richard Cordray (D) beat out Michael Crites (R), and Robert M. Owens (I) for the position.

The Solicitor General of Ohio is the top appellate lawyer in the attorney general&#x27;s office.

In November 2014, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine secured a $22 million settlement from the credit score company ScoreSense, which is owned by the company One Technologies. DeWine had filed civil charges against the company along with the Illinois attorney general and Federal Trade Commission. Ohio consumers and state government will receive a portion of the settlement. According to the FTC, One Technologies &quot;lured customers with &quot;free access&quot; to their credit scores and then billed them a recurring fee of $29.95 per month...&quot; Over 200,000 consumers had filed complaints against the company.

<doc id="950025" wikidata="Q11335432" url="?curid=950025" title="Plastic magnet">
<text>A plastic magnet is a non-metallic magnet made from an organic polymer.

Plastic magnets could be used in computer hardware such as disc drives, as well as in medical devices such as pacemakers and cochlear implants, where the organic material is more likely to be biocompatible than its metallic counterparts.

== Examples ==
=== PANiCNQ ===
PANiCNQ is plastic magnet made of a combination of emeraldine-based polyaniline (PANi), and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). It was created in 2004 at the University of Durham by Pakistan born scientist Naveed A. Zaidi and colleagues, and it was the first magnetic polymer to function at room temperature.
PANi is a conductive polymer that is stable in air. When combined with the free radical-forming TCNQ as an acceptor molecule, it can mimic the mechanism of metallic magnets. The magnetic properties arise from the fully pi-conjugated nitrogen-containing backbone combined with molecular charge transfer side groups. These properties cause the molecule to have a high density of localized spins that can give rise to coupling of their magnetic fields. When this polymer magnet is synthesized, the polymer chains need 3 months to line up before displaying any notable magnetism.

=== Light-tunable magnet ===
In February 2002, researchers from Ohio State University &amp; University of Utah developed the world&#x27;s first light-tunable plastic magnet. The plastic material became 1.5 times more magnetic when blue light was shined on it. Green laser light reversed the effect somewhat by decreasing the material&#x27;s magnetism to 60 percent of its normal level. The plastic magnet was made from a polymer made of tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) combined with manganese (Mn) ions – atoms of the metal manganese with electrons removed. The magnet functioned up to a temperature of .

<doc id="950028" wikidata="Q692816" url="?curid=950028" title="Beaver Stadium">
<text>Beaver Stadium is a college football stadium on the campus of Pennsylvania State University in Penn State University Park. It has been home to the Penn State Nittany Lions football of the Big Ten Conference since 1960, though some parts of the stadium date back to 1909. It was also the site of university commencements until 1984. The stadium, as well as its predecessors, is named after James A. Beaver (1837–1914), a governor of Pennsylvania (1887–91), president of the university&#x27;s board of trustees, and native of nearby Millerstown. Officially, the stadium is part of the municipality known as College Township, Pennsylvania, although it has a University Park address.

Beaver Stadium has an official seating capacity of 106,572, making it currently the second largest stadium in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth largest in the world. Its natural grass playing field is aligned northwest to southeast at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

Beaver Stadium is widely known as one of the toughest venues for opposing teams in collegiate athletics. In 2008, it was recognized as having the best student section in the country for the second consecutive year. In 2019, it was named student section of the year by a committee of ESPN broadcasters and writers.

In 2016, Beaver Stadium was voted the number-one football stadium in college football in a &quot;USA Today&quot; poll, garnering over 41 percent of the vote. In March 2019, &quot;USA Today&quot; conducted another poll asking voters to decide the best stadium in the United States during &quot;Bracket Madness&quot;, which coincided with the 2019 NCAA basketball tournament. Hundreds of thousands of fans voted for their favorites throughout the week. In the championship match-up, Beaver Stadium beat Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse to claim the title of Ultimate Stadium.

Beaver Stadium was the first to have its interior included in Google Street View.

==History==
===Predecessors===
Until 1893, Penn State teams participated in sporting events on Old Main lawn, a large grassy area in front of the primary classroom building of the time. Beaver Field, a 500-seat structure located behind the current site of the Osmond Building, was the first permanent home for Penn State&#x27;s football team, and the first game played there was a Penn State victory over Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh) on November 6, 1893. In 1909, New Beaver Field opened just northeast of Rec Hall, roughly in the current location of the Nittany Parking deck. It served as Penn State&#x27;s stadium until 1959. During the 1959-60 offseason, the entire 30,000 seat facility was dismantled and moved half a mile to the east end of campus. It was then reassembled, bolted onto a modern upper grandstand, and named Beaver Stadium. The &quot;new&quot; stadium seated 46,284 people; it roughly corresponds to the lower level of the current facility.

===Expansions===

The stadium has been expanded six times, reflecting Penn State&#x27;s rise to national prominence under Joe Paterno. then the team&#x27;s head coach, more than doubling in size in the process. Expansions in 1972 brought capacity to 57,538. Another expansion in 1976 increased capacity to 60,203. In 1978, 16,000 seats were added when the stadium was cut into sections and raised on hydraulic lifts, allowing the insertion of seating along the inner ring of the stadium where the track had previously been located, raising capacity to 76,639. This expansion is particularly noticeable, as there&#x27;s a distinct color change when crossing from the original, New Beaver Field steel grandstands onto the newer, stone and concrete additions. In 1980, maximum capacity increased to 83,770. In 1985, walkways were added around the tops of the end zones and entry ramps at the stadium&#x27;s corners resulted in lowering the capacity to 83,370. An expansion was completed for the 1991 football season, placing an upper deck addition over the north end zone and raising capacity to 93,967.

A major and somewhat controversial construction project took place in 2001, raising the stadium&#x27;s total capacity to 107,282. An upper deck was added to the south end of the stadium, blocking the view of neighboring Mount Nittany (which had sentimental value for some fans), but making Beaver Stadium the second largest stadium in the nation, behind Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

In 2006, the stadium underwent major structural and aesthetic upgrades. Old steel beams supporting the upper seats in the east, north and west were replaced and strengthened, and new railing was installed, stronger than the old railing which collapsed following the 2005 Ohio State game.

In 2007, over 22,000 student tickets sold out in 59 minutes. In 2008, when tickets were sold by grade, tickets allotted for junior students sold out in 90 seconds, and those for sophomores and freshmen sold out in under three minutes each.

In 2011, the stadium capacity was reduced from 107,282 seats to 106,572 to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The appearance of the stadium has been enhanced with the addition of large blue letters spelling out &quot;The Pennsylvania State University&quot; on the west-facing suites, and a list of Penn State&#x27;s undefeated, National Championship, and Big Ten Championship years underneath. 2012 is the exception, which was added to this list during the November 24, 2012 game against Wisconsin to honor the team that played after sanctions were passed down during the aftermath of the Jerry Sandusky scandal. Nine markers depicting the various traditions of Beaver Stadium, including the Penn State Blue Band, the student section, and the blue buses which bring the team to the stadium, have been placed around the stadium as well. In late October, the walls surrounding the field were refaced with Pennsylvania limestone. An iron gate has replaced the old chain-link face at the players&#x27; entrance into the stadium. On the new gate the words &quot;PENN STATE&quot; appear in blue.
The Penn State Office of Physical Plant and Athletic Department expanded the north and south video boards to HD video boards and because parts were no longer available for the old boards. The area of the new video screens dedicated to game replays and game-related video is much larger than the screens they replaced. The two video boards together are some of the largest in college football. The renovation expanded the size of the video boards by eliminating the current game clock and lamp matrix display. The boards are only the second of their kind made and are 4k UHD. The project was completed prior to the first home game of the 2014 season. The boards cost approx. $10 million. Also on the back of both boards is a LED Nittany Lion logo that lights at night and was added to promote the &quot;Penn State brand&quot;. Starting with the 2015 season fireworks are shot off from the top of each scoreboard when the team takes the field.

In the fall semester of 2015, university officials stated that they are seeking options to renovate or replace Beaver Stadium in the next 10 years. Officials state that there is a recognized need in an upgrade in the facilities. The stadium remains antiquated, despite multiple expansions and the additions of luxury boxes and HD scoreboards. Outdated plumbing requires complete winterization each November. Elevators are small and sluggish while concourses are narrow. The stadium lacks concession options and still uses bleachers. The limitations prevent wider use of the venue; the university would like to expand the number of events held at Beaver Stadium, such as major concerts and a long-discussed potential hosting of the NHL Winter Classic. Many fans are opposed to replacing Beaver Stadium due to the history and tradition but many agree that there is a need for renovation.

On September 8, 2021, Penn State dedicated a Chair of Honor for all prisoners of war/missing in action (POW/MIA) service members in the &quot;SLU&quot; section of the stadium, above the student section, where it will remain empty in perpetuity. This chair was unveiled during the Nittany Lions&#x27; first home football game of the season against Ball State on September 11.

On May 21, 2024, the Penn State Board of Trustees approved a renovation of Beaver Stadium, which will grow revenue-generating opportunities, transform the fan and community experience, and fuel the future funding for all 31 athletics programs at Penn State. The vote was 26-2, with three abstaining. The approved renovations will enable year-round use of Beaver Stadium, further driving economic growth and development in the surrounding region. Including the first stage of the Beaver Stadium renovation, which was approved in May 2023, the total project will cost no more than $700 million and will be completed before the 2027 college football season. This multi-year project is financed and paid for entirely by Intercollegiate Athletics. A part of the renovation, dedicated to the scoreboards, was completed before the Kent State game. 

On the morning of January 4, 2025, the west end press box was demolished with controlled explosives. It was originally built at New Beaver Field and was moved to the current Beaver Stadium in 1959. It was significantly expanded in 1980.

==Attendance records==

A record crowd of 111,030 witnessed Penn State&#x27;s 20–13 loss to Ohio State, on November 2, 2024.
In 2002, Penn State set an NCAA record for most fans to ever watch a college football team over the course of a single season at home. Beaver Stadium hosted 8 games in 2002, and averaged 107,239 per game totaling what was at the time an NCAA record of 857,911 in total home attendance. Penn State averaged 95,977 fans in attendance both home and away over the 13 game schedule which broke the all time full season attendance NCAA record at 1,247,707 spectators over the course of the 2002 campaign.

==Traditions==
===Chants===
&quot;WE ARE!&quot;...&quot;PENN STATE!&quot; is perhaps the most well-known chant across campus; &quot;We Are Penn State&quot; conveys the university&#x27;s sense of unity and school pride. At Beaver Stadium, the chant is often relayed across the stadium in a &quot;WE ARE!&quot;...&quot;PENN STATE!&quot;. Penn State call and response, with each side of the grandstand chanting one half of the motto. This is typically followed by a similar &quot;THANK YOU!&quot;...&quot;YOU&#x27;RE WELCOME!&quot; chant. It is also featured in Penn State&#x27;s White Out games, which use Zombie Nation&#x27;s &quot;Kernkraft 400&quot; as the fight song instead of &quot;Fight On, State&quot;.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Go, P-S-U&quot; - A more recently started chant which plays during a performance of The Hey Song by the Penn State Blue Band prior to every game.

===Tailgating===
Tailgating is very popular outside Beaver Stadium. Alcohol is permitted in all areas around Beaver Stadium and is sold inside the stadium on home football games, as of 2022. In August 2019, Penn State was ranked #15 by tailgater magazine for the &quot;tailgate culture&quot; that surrounds Beaver Stadium on gameday. The magazine stated that &quot;win or lose, the university offers an incredible tailgate environment&quot; for over 100,000 fans, referencing traditions related to Penn State football such as camping outside Beaver Stadium for Nittanyville to making ice cream stops at the Berkey Creamery.

===Student section &quot;S-Zone&quot;===
The &quot;S-Zone&quot; within the student section is another tradition at Beaver Stadium. A small section behind the end zone are all given white and blue shirts supplied by the Pennsylvania State University Lion Ambassadors to create an &quot;S&quot; in the student section. The &quot;S-Zone&quot; was moved from the 20 yard line to its current location at the beginning of the 2011 football season, as the student section was shifted over to between the 10 yard lines. For the 2008, 2011, 2013, 2018, and 2023 Homecoming Games, the &quot;S-Zone&quot; was black and pink, in honor of the original Penn State colors. On April 21, 2007, for the Annual Blue and White Game (Spring Scrimmage), the &quot;S-Zone&quot; was converted to a &quot;VT-Zone&quot;, in honor of the victims of the massacre that took place on April 16, 2007, at Virginia Tech.

===Nittanyville===

Starting with the October 2005 game against Ohio State, students have camped out outside Gate A to obtain good seats for home games; &quot;Nittanyville&quot; is a recognized university club with rules of conduct. It was originally known as &quot;Paternoville&quot;. During whiteout games, a special week-long camping starts on Monday instead of the usual Wednesday or Thursday.

===Whiteout games===
After failed experiments with &quot;Code Blue&quot; during the down year of 2004, a localized version of the &quot;Winnipeg White Out&quot; made national headlines during the 2005 game versus Ohio State. In this game, despite temperatures and a misty rain, nearly every student, along with many other fans, wore a white shirt to the game, creating a sea of white. This was deemed a success, as the student section was declared &quot;The best in the country.&quot; by ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit, and the Nittany Lions won the game in an intense defensive battle, 17–10. The student section was widely credited with aiding the defense, which kept the Buckeyes&#x27; future Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, Troy Smith, in check by intercepting a pass and recovering a decisive fumble in the final minutes. Smith was forced to call several timeouts during the game due to inability to communicate with his offense on the field.

In 2007, for the Notre Dame game, a full-stadium &quot;White House&quot; was declared. While it is widely believed that this change was a result of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Phoenix Coyotes notifying the university that the phrase &quot;White Out&quot; was trademarked by the franchise during their time as the Winnipeg Jets, the &quot;White House&quot; moniker was invented to remind the crowd that everyone, and not just the student section, was to wear white. The newly christened &quot;White House&quot; was also deemed a success, as nearly every Penn State fan in attendance wore white, and the Lions won, 31–10. In 2008, the &quot;White House&quot; was met with similar success, a 38–24 win over Illinois. From 2012 to 2019, the full-stadium &quot;Whiteout&quot; games have been against either Ohio State or Michigan. In 2021, the first Southeastern Conference (SEC) team, the Auburn Tigers played during the &quot;Whiteout&quot;, the Nittany Lions won 28–20.

===Zombie Nation===
Zombie Nation is a tradition that was started during the 2004 football season. After the Nittany Lions make a big play, (typically on defense) the stadium blasts the song &quot;Kernkraft 400&quot; by Zombie Nation which ignites 107,000 into a frenzied blur all bouncing up and down in unison, waving towels and shakers wildly chanting &quot;WE ARE PENN STATE!&quot; during the break in the melody of the song. The tradition gained national attention in 2005, after Penn State&#x27;s 17–10 victory over Ohio State, which at the time, delivered the second highest audience for a regular season college football game ever on ESPN. Zombie Nation along with the &quot;Penn State Whiteout&quot;, have been direct influencers of Beaver Stadium being home to what many consider the best student section in college football. Since the tradition began, both Zombie Nation and the &quot;Whiteout&quot; have since spread to encompass the entire stadium.

===Tunnel entrance===
The tunnel entrance is a Nittany Lions tradition in which the head coach leads the team from the locker room under the South side of the stadium to the tunnel to a closed metal gate reading &quot;PENN STATE&quot; in bold Arial font. When the team arrives at the gate, the Nittany Lion opens the gate and motion for the team to walk through it, as if welcoming the team to the field. The team then lingers until four minutes were left on the pregame clock, and then the head coach leads the team through the tunnel created by the Blue Band.

===Fast and slow wave===
The Penn State Student Section initiates a wave during sporting events. After the wave passes around the stadium twice, the student section slows down the wave to about a fourth the speed of the normal wave. After the slow wave passes, the wave speeds up to over twice the speed of the normal wave. The wave has, on occasion, been reversed in direction following the fast wave.

=== Blue Band traditions ===
====The Flip====
After the Penn State Blue Band has entered the field and played the first eight bars of &quot;The Nittany Lion&quot;, the Blue Bands Drum Major does a high-stepping, stiff-legged sprint in between rows of band members from the goal line to the 50 yard line, where he does a front flip. Legend states that if the drum major lands the flip, the team will win that afternoon. He then performs another flip while running towards the end zone. After he stands back up, he and the Nittany Lion, who is holding his baton, take five high-steps toward each other, meeting 5 yards deep in the end zone. The Lion and Drum Major both place both hands on the baton in alternating order (in the same manner children choosing teams with a baseball bat would) and then throw the baton into the ground. They then salute each other, embrace arms, and then both excitedly run towards the student section, where they are cheered enthusiastically.

====Floating Lions====
The Blue Band performs &quot;The Nittany Lion&quot; and makes its way from its &quot;PSU&quot; formation to roll into spelling &quot;LIONS&quot; as it marches across the field. Once reaching the other side, the band reverses the &quot;LIONS&quot; to be readable to the east side of the stadium, while playing &quot;Fight On, State&quot;. This is known as the &quot;trademark drill&quot; of the Blue Band.

<text>A 3D display is a display device capable of conveying depth to the viewer. Many 3D displays are stereoscopic displays, which produce a basic 3D effect by means of stereopsis, but can cause eye strain and visual fatigue. Newer 3D displays such as holographic and light field displays produce a more realistic 3D effect by combining stereopsis and accurate focal length for the displayed content. Newer 3D displays in this manner cause less visual fatigue than classical stereoscopic displays.

As of 2021, the most common type of 3D display is a stereoscopic display, which is the type of display used in almost all virtual reality equipment. 3D displays can be near-eye displays like in VR headsets, or they can be in a device further away from the eyes like a 3D-enabled mobile device or 3D movie theater.

The term &quot;3D display&quot; can also be used to refer to a volumetric display which may generate content that can be viewed from all angles. 

==History==
The first 3D display was created by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1832. It was a stereoscopic display that had rudimentary ability for representing depth.

==Stereoscopic displays==
Stereoscopic displays are commonly referred to as &quot;stereo displays,&quot; &quot;stereo 3D displays,&quot; &quot;stereoscopic 3D displays,&quot; or sometimes erroneously as just &quot;3D displays.&quot;

The basic technique of stereoscopic displays is to present offset images that are displayed separately to the left and right eye. Both of these 2D offset images are then combined in the brain to give the perception of 3D depth. Although the term &quot;3D&quot; is ubiquitously used, the presentation of dual 2D images is distinctly different from displaying a light field, and is also different from displaying an image in three-dimensional space.

The most notable difference to displays that can show full 3D is that the observer&#x27;s head movements and change in accommodation of the eyes will not change the visuals seen by the viewer. For example, some holographic displays do not have such limitations.

It is an overstatement of capability to refer to dual 2D images as being &quot;3D&quot;. The accurate term &quot;stereoscopic&quot; is more cumbersome than the common misnomer &quot;3D&quot;, which has been entrenched after many decades of unquestioned misuse. 3D displays are often referred to as also stereoscopic displays because they meet the lower criteria of being stereoscopic as well.

Based on the principles of stereopsis, described by Sir Charles Wheatstone in the 1830s, stereoscopic technology provides a different image to the viewer&#x27;s left and right eyes. The following are some of the technical details and methodologies employed in some of the more notable stereoscopic systems that have been developed.

===Side-by-side images===
Traditional stereoscopic photography consists of creating a 3D illusion starting from a pair of 2D images, a stereogram. The easiest way to enhance depth perception in the brain is to provide the eyes of the viewer with two different images, representing two perspectives of the same object, with a minor deviation exactly equal to the perspectives that both eyes naturally receive in binocular vision.

If eyestrain and distortion are to be avoided, each of the two 2D images preferably should be presented to each eye of the viewer so that any object at infinite distance seen by the viewer should be perceived by that eye while it is oriented straight ahead, the viewer&#x27;s eyes being neither crossed nor diverging. When the picture contains no object at infinite distance, such as a horizon or a cloud, the pictures should be spaced correspondingly closer together.

The side-by-side method is extremely simple to create, but it can be difficult or uncomfortable to view without optical aids.

====Stereoscope and stereographic cards====
A stereoscope is a device for viewing stereographic cards, which are cards that contain two separate images that are printed side by side to create the illusion of a three-dimensional image.

====Transparency viewers====
Pairs of stereo views printed on a transparent base are viewed by transmitted light. One advantage of transparency viewing is the opportunity for a wider, more realistic dynamic range than is practical with prints on an opaque base; another is that a wider field of view may be presented since the images, being illuminated from the rear, may be placed much closer to the lenses.

The practice of viewing film-based stereoscopic transparencies dates to at least as early as 1931, when Tru-Vue began to market sets of stereo views on strips of 35 mm film that were fed through a hand-held Bakelite viewer. In 1939, a modified and miniaturized variation of this technology, employing cardboard disks containing seven pairs of small Kodachrome color film transparencies, was introduced as the View-Master.

====Head-mounted displays====

The user typically wears a helmet or glasses with two small LCD or OLED displays with magnifying lenses, one for each eye. The technology can be used to show stereo films, images or games. Head-mounted displays may also be coupled with head-tracking devices, allowing the user to &quot;look around&quot; the virtual world by moving their head, eliminating the need for a separate controller.

Owing to rapid advancements in computer graphics and the continuing miniaturization of video and other equipment these devices are beginning to become available at more reasonable cost. Head-mounted or wearable glasses may be used to view a see-through image imposed upon the real world view, creating what is called augmented reality. This is done by reflecting the video images through partially reflective mirrors. The real world can be seen through the partial mirror.

A recent development in holographic-waveguide or &quot;waveguide-based optics&quot; allows a stereoscopic images to be superimposed on real world without the uses of bulky reflective mirror.

====Head-mounted projection displays====
Head-mounted projection displays (HMPD) is similar to head-mounted displays but with images projected to and displayed on a retroreflective screen, The advantage of this technology over head-mounted display is that the focusing and vergence issues didn&#x27;t require fixing with corrective eye lenses. For image generation, Pico-projectors are used instead of LCD or OLED screens.

=== 3D glasses ===

==== Active shutter systems ====

With the eclipse method, a shutter blocks light from each appropriate eye when the converse eye&#x27;s image is projected on the screen. The display alternates between left and right images, and opens and closes the shutters in the glasses or viewer in synchronization with the images on the screen. This was the basis of the Teleview system which was used briefly in 1922.

A variation on the eclipse method is used in LCD shutter glasses. Glasses containing liquid crystal that will let light through in synchronization with the images on the cinema, television or computer screen, using the concept of alternate-frame sequencing. This is the method used by nVidia, XpanD 3D, and earlier IMAX systems. A drawback of this method is the need for each person viewing to wear expensive, electronic glasses that must be synchronized with the display system using a wireless signal or attached wire. The shutter-glasses are heavier than most polarized glasses, though lighter models are no heavier than some sunglasses or deluxe polarized glasses. However these systems do not require a silver screen for projected images.

Liquid crystal light valves work by rotating light between two polarizing filters. Due to these internal polarizers, LCD shutter-glasses darken the display image of any LCD, plasma, or projector image source, which has the result that images appear dimmer and contrast is lower than for normal non-3D viewing. This is not necessarily a usage problem; for some types of displays which are already very bright with poor grayish black levels, LCD shutter glasses may actually improve the image quality.

==== Anaglyph ====

In an anaglyph, the two images are superimposed in an additive light setting through two filters, one red and one cyan. In a subtractive light setting, the two images are printed in the same complementary colors on white paper. Glasses with colored filters in each eye separate the appropriate image by canceling the filter color out and rendering the complementary color black. A compensating technique, commonly known as Anachrome, uses a slightly more transparent cyan filter in the patented glasses associated with the technique. Process reconfigures the typical anaglyph image to have less parallax.

An alternative to the usual red and cyan filter system of anaglyph is ColorCode 3-D, a patented anaglyph system which was invented in order to present an anaglyph image in conjunction with the NTSC television standard, in which the red channel is often compromised. ColorCode uses the complementary colors of yellow and dark blue on-screen, and the colors of the glasses&#x27; lenses are amber and dark blue.

==== Polarization systems ====

To present a stereoscopic picture, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through different polarizing filters. The viewer wears eyeglasses which also contain a pair of polarizing filters oriented differently (clockwise/counterclockwise with circular polarization or at 90 degree angles, usually 45 and 135 degrees, with linear polarization). As each filter passes only that light which is similarly polarized and blocks the light polarized differently, each eye sees a different image. This is used to produce a three-dimensional effect by projecting the same scene into both eyes, but depicted from slightly different perspectives. Additionally, since both lenses have the same color, people with one dominant eye, where one eye is used more, are able to see the colors properly, previously negated by the separation of the two colors.

Circular polarization has an advantage over linear polarization, in that the viewer does not need to have their head upright and aligned with the screen for the polarization to work properly. With linear polarization, turning the glasses sideways causes the filters to go out of alignment with the screen filters causing the image to fade and for each eye to see the opposite frame more easily. For circular polarization, the polarizing effect works regardless of how the viewer&#x27;s head is aligned with the screen such as tilted sideways, or even upside down. The left eye will still only see the image intended for it, and vice versa, without fading or crosstalk.

Polarized light reflected from an ordinary motion picture screen typically loses most of its polarization. So an expensive silver screen or aluminized screen with negligible polarization loss has to be used. All types of polarization will result in a darkening of the displayed image and poorer contrast compared to non-3D images. Light from lamps is normally emitted as a random collection of polarizations, while a polarization filter only passes a fraction of the light. As a result, the screen image is darker. This darkening can be compensated by increasing the brightness of the projector light source. If the initial polarization filter is inserted between the lamp and the image generation element, the light intensity striking the image element is not any higher than normal without the polarizing filter, and overall image contrast transmitted to the screen is not affected.

==== Interference filter technology ====
Dolby 3D uses specific wavelengths of red, green, and blue for the right eye, and different wavelengths of red, green, and blue for the left eye. Eyeglasses which filter out the very specific wavelengths allow the wearer to see a 3D image. This technology eliminates the expensive silver screens required for polarized systems such as RealD, which is the most common 3D display system in theaters. It does, however, require much more expensive glasses than the polarized systems. It is also known as spectral comb filtering or wavelength multiplex visualization

The Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system also uses this technology, though with a wider spectrum and more &quot;teeth&quot; to the &quot;comb&quot; (5 for each eye in the Omega/Panavision system). The use of more spectral bands per eye eliminates the need to color process the image, required by the Dolby system. Evenly dividing the visible spectrum between the eyes gives the viewer a more relaxed &quot;feel&quot; as the light energy and color balance is nearly 50–50. Like the Dolby system, the Omega system can be used with white or silver screens. But it can be used with either film or digital projectors, unlike the Dolby filters that are only used on a digital system with a color correcting processor provided by Dolby. The Omega/Panavision system also claims that their glasses are cheaper to manufacture than those used by Dolby. In June 2012, the Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system was discontinued by DPVO Theatrical, who marketed it on behalf of Panavision, citing &quot;challenging global economic and 3D market conditions&quot;.
Although DPVO dissolved its business operations, Omega Optical continues promoting and selling 3D systems to non-theatrical markets. Omega Optical’s 3D system contains projection filters and 3D glasses. In addition to the passive stereoscopic 3D system, Omega Optical has produced enhanced anaglyph 3D glasses. The Omega’s red/cyan anaglyph glasses use complex metal oxide thin film coatings and high quality annealed glass optics.

==== Other ====
The Pulfrich effect is a psychophysical percept wherein lateral motion of an object in the field of view is interpreted by the visual cortex as having a depth component, due to a relative difference in signal timings between the two eyes.

Prismatic glasses make cross-viewing easier as well as over/under-viewing possible, examples include the KMQ viewer.

===Autostereoscopy===
In this method, glasses are not necessary to see the stereoscopic image. Lenticular lens and parallax barrier technologies involve imposing two (or more) images on the same sheet, in narrow, alternating strips, and using a screen that either blocks one of the two images&#x27; strips (in the case of parallax barriers) or uses equally narrow lenses to bend the strips of image and make it appear to fill the entire image (in the case of lenticular prints). To produce the stereoscopic effect, the person must be positioned so that one eye sees one of the two images and the other sees the other. The optical principles of multiview auto-stereoscopy have been known for over a century.

Both images are projected onto a high-gain, corrugated screen which reflects light at acute angles. In order to see the stereoscopic image, the viewer must sit within a very narrow angle that is nearly perpendicular to the screen, limiting the size of the audience. Lenticular was used for theatrical presentation of numerous shorts in Russia from 1940 to 1948 and in 1946 for the feature-length film Robinzon Kruzo

Though its use in theatrical presentations has been rather limited, lenticular has been widely used for a variety of novelty items and has even been used in amateur 3D photography. Recent use includes the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D with an autostereoscopic display that was released in 2009. Other examples for this technology include autostereoscopic LCD displays on monitors, notebooks, TVs, mobile phones and gaming devices, such as the Nintendo 3DS.

==Volumetric display==
Volumetric displays use some physical mechanism to display points of light within a volume. Such displays use voxels instead of pixels. Volumetric displays include multiplanar displays, which have multiple display planes stacked up, and rotating panel displays, where a rotating panel sweeps out a volume.

Other technologies have been developed to project light dots in the air above a device. An infrared laser is focused on the destination in space, generating a small bubble of plasma which emits visible light.

==Light field / holographic display==
A light field display tries to recreate a &quot;light field&quot; on the surface of the display. In contrast to a 2D display which shows a distinct color on each pixel, a light field display shows a distinct color on each pixel &quot;for each direction that the light ray emits to&quot;. This way, eyes from different positions will see different pictures on the display, creating parallax and thus creating a sense of 3D. A light field display is like a glass window, people see 3D objects behind the glass, despite that all light rays they see come from (through) the glass.

The light field in front of the display can be created in two ways: 1) by emitting different light rays in different directions at each point on the display; 2) by recreating a wavefront in front of the display. Displays using the first method are called ray-based or light field displays. Displays using the second method are called wavefront-based or holographic displays. Wavefront-based displays work in the same way as holograms. Compared to ray-based displays, a wavefront-based display not only reconstructs the light field, but also reconstructs the curvature of the plane waves, and the phase differences of the waves in different directions.

Integral photography is one of the ray-based methods with full-parallax information. However, there are also ray-based techniques developed with horizontal-parallax-only.

=== Holographic displays ===

Holographic display is a display technology that has the ability to provide all four eye mechanisms: binocular disparity, motion parallax, accommodation and convergence. The 3D objects can be viewed without wearing any special glasses and no visual fatigue will be caused to human eyes.

In 2013, a Silicon valley Company LEIA Inc started manufacturing holographic displays well suited for mobile devices (watches, smartphones or tablets) using a multi-directional backlight and allowing a wide full-parallax angle view to see 3D content without the need of glasses. Their first product was part of a mobile phone (Red Hydrogen One) and later on in their own Android tablet.

=== Integral imaging ===

Integral imaging is an autostereoscopic or multiscopic 3D display, meaning that it displays a 3D image without the use of special glasses on the part of the viewer. It achieves this by placing an array of microlenses (similar to a lenticular lens) in front of the image, where each lens looks different depending on viewing angle. Thus rather than displaying a 2D image that looks the same from every direction, it reproduces a 3D light field, creating stereo images that exhibit parallax when the viewer moves.

=== Compressive light field displays ===
A new display technology called &quot;compressive light field&quot; is being developed. These prototype displays use layered LCD panels and compression algorithms at the time of display. Designs include dual and multilayer
devices that are driven by algorithms such as computed tomography and Non-negative matrix factorization and non-negative tensor factorization.

== Problems ==
Each of these display technologies can be seen to have limitations, whether the location of the viewer, cumbersome or unsightly equipment or great cost. The display of artifact-free 3D images remains difficult.

<text>Keetmanshoop is a town in the ǁKaras Region of southern Namibia. It is named after , a German industrialist and benefactor of the city. Keetmanshoop had a population of 27,862 people in 2023.

== History ==

Before the colonial era, the settlement was known as &quot;ǂNuǂgoaes&quot; or &quot;Swartmodder&quot;, both meaning &quot;Black Marsh&quot; and indicating the presence of a spring in the area. The first white settler, Guilliam Visagie, arrived here in 1785. When in February 1850 the Kharoǃoan clan (Keetmanshoop Nama) split from the Red Nation, the main subtribe of the Nama people, they settled permanently in the area. In 1860 the Rhenish Missionary Society founded a mission there to christianise the local Nama people. The first missionary, Johann Georg Schröder, arrived in Keetmanshoop on April 14, 1866, which is now marked as the founding date of Keetmanshoop. The mission station was named after the German trader and director of the Rhenish Missionary Society, , who supported the mission financially, although he never actually visited the place himself.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Keetmanshoop is an important centre for the Karakul sheep farming community.

Keetmanshoop is connected to the TransNamib railway system, situated on the line from Windhoek to Upington in South Africa. The J. Stephanus Stadium is located in Keetmanshoop and is home to Fedics United F.C., a football team in the Namibia Premier League.

== Geography ==
Close to Keetmanshoop is the Naute Dam and the Neckartal Dam, the largest dam in the country.

===Natural history===

The town is situated near two quiver tree forests, one of them being a national monument and a major tourist attraction of Namibia. It is also close to the Giant&#x27;s Playground, a natural geological feature formed about 180 million years ago that consists of dolerite rocks that look as if they were stacked by giants.

Near Keetsmanshoop are notable localities for fossil &quot;Mesosaurus&quot;, an extinct genus of reptile from the Early Permian of southern Africa and South America.

===Climate===
Keetmanshoop has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), with long, very hot summers and cool winters. The annual average rainfall is only . Keetmanshoop is one of the sunniest places year-round on the planet with a mean sunshine duration over 3,870 hours yearly or 10.7 hours of sunshine daily, well above 87% of the time. The annual mean temperature is 21.1 °C (70.0 °F) with a mean annual high of 28.8 °C (83.8 °F) and a low of 13.3 °C (55.9 °F). The climate is characterised by sunshine and dryness as well as moderate heat all year long.


===Demographics===
==Politics==
Keetmanshoop is a municipality, governed by council that comprises seven seats.

In the 2010 local authority election, a total of 3,156 votes were cast in the city. SWAPO won with approximately 48% of the vote. Of the three other parties seeking votes in the election, Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) received approximately 35% of the vote, followed by the Democratic Party of Namibia (DPN, 10%) and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 7%).

The 2015 local authority election was won by SWAPO by a much larger margin. SWAPO accumulated 2,337 votes and won five seats in the municipal council. DTA (538 votes) and RDP (186 votes) gained one seat each.

The 2020 Namibian local authority election was won by LPM. LPM accumulated 3,619 votes and won five seats in the municipal council. SWAPO (1648 votes) gained two seats.

==Notable buildings and structures==
The Rhenish Missionary Church was erected in 1895 and now also contains a museum. It was declared a historic monument in 1978 and is a well-known landmark. Its unique combination of Gothic architecture cast in African stone makes it one of the architectural masterpieces in the country and a popular tourist attraction. Other notable buildings are the Schützenhaus (&quot;marksmen&#x27;s club house&quot;, 1905–07), the railway station building (1908) and the Imperial Post Office (now the Keetmanshoop tourist information, erected in 1910).

==Notable people==

* Anthony Antoncich (1917–1998), Royal Air Force pilot, born in Keetmanshoop
* Dawid Bezuidenhout (1935–1998), first chairman of the Transitional Government of National Unity, born in Keetmanshoop
* Hellmut von Leipzig (1921–2016), combat driver of Erwin Rommel, born in Keetmanshoop
* John Ya-Otto (1938–1994), member of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia and former ambassador to Angola, grew up in Keetmanshoop

<text>Sleeman Breweries is a Japanese-owned Canadian brewery founded by John Warren Sleeman in 1988 in Guelph, Ontario. The company is the third-largest brewing company in Canada. Along with its own Sleeman brands, the company produces under licence the Stroh&#x27;s family of brands, Maclays Ale and Sapporo Premium beers for sale in Canada. The company&#x27;s parent Sapporo owns 4.2 per cent of Ontario&#x27;s primary beer retailer The Beer Store. 

The company is the re-establishment of a line of brewing companies owned by the Sleeman family dating back to the 1830s. The original Sleeman Breweries was established in the 1850s and operated until it lost its licence due to smuggling and tax evasion, for 50 years, in 1933.

John W. Sleeman re-established the brewery in the 1980s using the original company recipes. In 2006, Sleeman Breweries was purchased by Sapporo Brewery for  million. John W. Sleeman remained as CEO until 2010 when he relinquished that role and was made Chairman of the company.

==History==
John H. Sleeman was born in Cornwall, England, in 1805 and came to Upper Canada (present day Ontario) in 1834, first settling in St. David&#x27;s (Niagara-on-the-Lake) where he founded the Stamford Spring Brewery in 1836. He and his family moved to Guelph in 1847 where they operated a series of breweries including the Hodgert’s Brewery, and the Silver Creek Brewery, which he opened in 1851. His son George Sleeman joined the company in 1859 as general manager and was named a partner in 1865. John H. died in 1893.

By 1890, George Sleeman had achieved great success with Silver Creek Brewery which had sales in Ontario and Quebec. He incorporated it into the Sleeman Brewing and Malting Company Limited with members of his immediate family. Due to excessive investments in his Guelph Street Railway Company, he lost the businesses to the banks in 1905; he then opened the Springbank Brewery. A year later the banks sold the brewery back to Sleeman. The family subsequently operated breweries in Guelph, often with success, until 1933.

Prohibition in Canada had an effect on the business. In Ontario, prohibition started in 1916 with the passing of the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot; by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. While that eliminated the domestic market, the law allowed for brewing for export, so the Sleemans continued to do so, shipping their products to the US. This was perfectly legal until 1920 when the &quot;Volstead Act&quot; led to Prohibition in the United States as well. The Sleeman family (including younger members) subsequently worked with bootleggers to export their beer to Michigan, paying no taxes on the illegally gained profits. Some sources (including John W. Sleeman) hint that the family was involved with Al Capone but after considerable research, historian Micheal Matchett suggests that the contact in the US was actually Rocco Perri, often called the &quot;Al Capone of Canada&quot; according to the book &quot;Rocco Perri: The Story of Canada&#x27;s Most Notorious Bootlegger.&quot; Perri had documented connections with Guelph&#x27;s large Italian population.

In April 1927, the family claimed to a Parliament of Canada special committee that the business&#x27; books had been lost. Eventually, the smuggling was uncovered; it was allowed to continue however, on the agreement that taxes would be paid. Since the business refused to pay, charges were laid for smuggling and for non-payment of taxes later in 1933. On conviction, the family&#x27;s license to brew beer was revoked for 50 years, effectively ending their entire enterprise. The brewing operation was sold to the Jockey Club Brewery Ltd.

===Revival===
Five decades later, in 1984, John W. Sleeman of Oakville, Ontario, great-great-grandson of John H. Sleeman, acquired the book of family beer recipes from his aunt Florian. He incorporated the new Sleeman Brewing and Malting Co. Ltd. in Guelph and began producing beer in 1988 with backing from Stroh Brewery Company for much of the $3-million he needed, a loan from a Detroit bank, and about $500,000 of his own money. The company flourished.

In 2006, Sleeman Breweries was purchased by Sapporo Breweries for $400 million; in the agreement, John W. Sleeman sold all of his shares to Sapporo but continued as president until 2010. In 2012, the company produced of beverages, an increase of approximately over the previous year.

As of 2020, the company&#x27;s President and CEO was Jesse Hanazawa. The company was brewing its products in three cities: Guelph, Ontario; Chambly, Quebec; and Vernon, British Columbia. These facilities were manufacturing Sleeman, Okanagan Spring and Unibroue Canadian beers as well as the Sapporo, Old Milwaukee and Pabst Blue Ribbon brands. (The plant in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia was closed in 2013.)

==Acquisitions==
Over the years, Sleeman either acquired other breweries or purchased the rights to distribute, or manufacture and distribute, various brands of beer.

*In 1996, the Sleeman brewery purchased the Okanagan Spring Brewery and the consortium formed the new Sleeman Breweries Ltd.
*In 1998, the company acquired Upper Canada Brewing and Quebec&#x27;s Brasserie Seigneuriale Inc.
*In 1999, Sleeman purchased Shaftebury Brewing Company, a large microbrewery in Delta, B.C.
*Also in 1999, Sleeman purchased the Canadian rights to brew and distribute the American Stroh Brewing Company&#x27;s folio of brands, including Stroh&#x27;s, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Old Milwaukee, Rainier and others for $39 million.
*In 2000, Sleeman bought Maritime Beer Co., a small bankrupt brewer in Dartmouth, N.S.
*In 2002, the company purchased the rights to distribute products of the Dutch Grolsch Brewery in Canada.
*In 2004, the company bought Unibroue, Quebec&#x27;s largest craft brewer that was making a line of premium beers in Chambly, Quebec.
*In 2019, the company bought Wild Rose Brewery, a small craft brewery in Calgary, Alberta.

==Timeline==
Sleeman&#x27;s breweries date back to 1836 when John H., a malter and brewer, founded Stamford Springs Brewery.
* 1800s – The &quot;Slyman family&quot;, unlicensed English brewers, change their name to &quot;Sleeman&quot;.
* 1805 – John Sleeman is born in Cornwall, England.
* 1834 – John H. Sleeman leaves Cornwall and arrives in Upper Canada (Ontario); he settles in St. Davids (Niagara-on-the-Lake).

* 2006 – Sapporo Breweries purchases Sleeman for approximately $400 million.
* 2014 – Shaftebury Brewing Company is sold to Fireweed Brewing Company

==Operations==
The brewery produces a line of beers under the Sleeman name, including:

* Clear 2.0 (a low carbohydrate beer)
* Cream Ale
* Original Lager
* Honey Brown Lager
* Silver Creek Lager
* Light
* Rousse Dark
* India Pale Ale
* Fine Porter

Aside from its own brands, the company brews Pabst products for the Canadian market, including Old Milwaukee, Stroh&#x27;s, Schlitz and Pabst Blue Ribbon. Other brands brewed under licence include Maclays Pale Ale for Maclays Brewery, Red Bull Beer and Sapporo Premium for Sapporo Brewery, their parent company.

Sleeman also continues to brew Upper Canada Lager and Upper Canada Dark Ale, two beers that were formerly produced by the &quot;Upper Canada Brewing Company&quot; before it acquired the company. Additional beers under the Upper Canada brand including Rebellion Lager, Wheat and Maple Brown Ale have since been discontinued.

Sleeman owns a 2% stake in The Beer Store (previously Brewers Retail), the operator of the primary retail outlet for beer in Ontario.

Many Sleeman brands are distributed in clear bottles, which are less expensive, but can result in the liquids becoming more susceptible to light damage. Concerned this would affect the beer&#x27;s taste, Sleeman compensates for this in a majority of their brews by using hops that are processed to be less light sensitive.

The annual Canadian Brewing Awards recognizes the best beers in Canada using blind taste tests. Most of the 2015 winners were craft beers. However, one of the winners was Sleeman Cream Ale, taking a Gold in the Cream Ale category.

==Marketing==
The brewery entered into a $1.2 million sponsorship deal with the City of Guelph in 2007 that gives Sleeman exclusive naming rights to the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre until 2020.

In 2010, the company began an advertising campaign drawing attention to their bootlegging past. In July 2016, an ad with the slogan &quot;Every bottle of Sleeman has a past – A shady past&quot; won Best Alcohol Ad of the Month from AdForum, an online showcase for advertising agencies.

<text>Orbis Pictus, or Orbis Sensualium Pictus (&quot;Visible World in Pictures&quot;), is a textbook for children written by Czech educator John Amos Comenius and published in 1658. It was the first widely used children&#x27;s textbook with pictures, published first in Latin and German and later republished in many European languages. It has been described as &quot;probably the first purpose-made children&#x27;s picturebook&quot;. The revolutionary book quickly spread around Europe and became the defining children&#x27;s textbook for centuries.

==Contents==
The book is divided into chapters illustrated by copperplate prints, which are described in the accompanying text. In most editions, the text is given in both Latin and the child&#x27;s native language. The book has 150 chapters and covers a wide range of subjects:

* nature
*botanics
*zoology
*religion
*humans and their activities

==History==
Originally published in Latin and German in 1658 in Nuremberg, the book soon spread to schools in Germany and other countries. The first English edition by Charles Hoole was published in 1659. The first quadrilingual edition (in Latin, German, Italian and French) was published in 1666. The first Czech translation was published in the 1685 quadrilingual edition (together with Latin, German and Hungarian), by the Breuer publishing house in Lőcse (today Levoča, Slovakia). In the years 1670 to 1780, new editions were published in various languages, with both the pictures and text content being improved.

&quot;Orbis Pictus&quot; had a long-lasting influence on children&#x27;s education. It was a precursor of both audio-visual techniques and the lexical approach in language learning.

In 1930 Otto Neurath claimed that images in &quot;Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft&quot; constituted a new &quot;Orbis Pictus&quot;.

==Early life and family==

Lederer, daughter of trial attorney Craig Spangenberg, taught at Concord High School. Her parents were both card players and Duke became interested in cards from an early age.

==Professional poker career==
===Early career===
Duke first played Texas hold&#x27;em at age 22 in a casino and continued to play for fun in Las Vegas casinos while visiting her brother, Howard Lederer, during her graduate school years. In 1992 after Duke moved to Billings her brother encouraged her to play poker professionally, sending her $2,400 and providing her with poker instruction books and lessons by phone. She began to play poker initially at the Crystal Lounge, a local bar in Billings that had a legal poker room. Following a successful year playing in Montana, her brother prompted her to enter tournaments at the 1994 World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas. Within the first month, she won $70,000 and decided to move to Las Vegas to pursue a professional poker career.

===Live poker===
In the first two tournaments of the 1994 World Series of Poker, Duke placed 14th and 5th, and finished 26th in the Main Event. Following her move to Las Vegas, Duke continued successfully playing poker on a professional basis through the late 1990s, and by 2000 had 16 in the money finishes at WSOP events, prior to the WSOP World Championship event that year.

From 2000 onward, she became well known for her high-profile achievements in WSOP events. In the 2000 WSOP World Championship event, although nine months pregnant with her third child, she placed 10th out of a total of 512 players, which was the second-highest finish by a woman in the event&#x27;s history. She received a WSOP gold bracelet in 2004, placing first out of 234 entrants in an Omaha Hi-Lo Split tournament. By July of that year she had become the top female money winner in the history of the WSOP; earning over $650,000 from 25 in the money finishes, including 13 at the final table. Later in 2004, she placed first in the inaugural WSOP Tournament of Champions, beating her brother and nine former world championship winners and winning $2 million. In the 2006 WSOP, she was one of only two women left in the tournament when she finished in 88th place with $51,129 in winnings. In 2006, Annie won the 2nd annual World Series of Poker&#x27;s Rock, Paper Scissors Tournament. 

In 2010, Duke won the NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship; she outlasted a field of 64 players, including eliminating previous winner Huck Seed, and defeating Erik Seidel in the final match. She won $500,000 and became the first and only female winner of the event, which ended in 2013.

In a 2020 interview, Duke described herself as retired from poker, stating she had not played since 2012. Duke&#x27;s total winnings from her 39 cashes at the WSOP is $1,166,567. , Duke&#x27;s total lifetime live tournament winnings of $4,270,548 still place her at fourth overall on the list of women all-time live tournament winnings.

====World Series of Poker Bracelets====
===Online poker activities===
From 2001 to 2004, Duke worked as a spokesperson and consultant for , a company that developed online poker software for multiplayer poker websites including Ultimate Bet. She moved to Portland, Oregon where was based in 2002 and remained there until 2005.

===Ultimate Bet scandal ===

In 2008, poker champion and Ultimate Bet spokesperson Russ Hamilton was found to be using cheating software to see other players&#x27; cards, which would ultimately win him millions of dollars. Though Ultimate Bet officials assured users that Hamilton acted alone, later evidence showed that other officials at the site knew about the scheme.

Duke represented Ultimate Bet as a spokesperson until December 2010, when she announced that she was leaving the company. No evidence was presented against Duke and there was no investigation of such with regard to any involvement or benefiting from any fraudulent crimes pertaining to the company.

On two occasions, Duke has testified in Congress on behalf of the Poker Players Alliance regarding the legality of Internet gambling. In 2007, she appeared in front of the House Committee on the Judiciary to testify against the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, and in 2010, she appeared in front of the House Committee on Financial Services to provide support for H.R. 2267, the Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act.

In 2013, audio recordings released by Travis Makar proved that Duke knew about the so-called God Mode but did not use it to swindle players as it was on a time delay.

===Retirement from poker ===

As of June 2020, Duke describes herself as retired from poker and says she has not played since 2012.

===Other poker activities===

====Debates, advocacy and coaching====
In addition to her advocacy regarding online gambling on behalf of the Poker Players Alliance, Duke has also been involved in debate about whether players should be allowed to wear the logos of their sponsor companies at televised poker events. In the mid-2000s, she was one of a number of players that argued against such restrictions being placed on players.

In 2006, she was one of seven players who filed a lawsuit against the World Poker Tour (WPT), alleging that the WPT&#x27;s release forms, required for participation in their events, were anti-competitive and violated individuals&#x27; rights to their own image. The suit was settled in 2008, when the WPT agreed to modify the release form.

Duke has opposed and avoided playing at the WSOP Ladies Event, arguing that having a separate WSOP bracelet event for women suggests that there is a difference in intellect between men and women. Duke has supported women in poker through coaching women players at the LIPS (Ladies International Poker Series) Tour, instructing at several women-only World Series of Poker Academy events, and giving the keynote speech at the 2011 Women in Poker Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

She has served on the World Series of Poker Player Advisory Council and has taught at the WSOP Poker Academy poker school. She has coached a number of celebrities on how to play poker, including Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, whom she coached to win the 2004 California State Poker Championship.

The first tournament in July 2007 was held at the start of the World Series of Poker and raised more than $700,000, which was donated to the ENOUGH Project and the International Rescue Committee. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, money raised in the organization&#x27;s tournaments was again donated to the ENOUGH Project, and also to Not On Our Watch, Refugees International, Water.org, and the Eastern Congo Initiative.

The Epic Poker League and its parent company were acquired by Pinnacle Entertainment in a June 2012 bankruptcy auction. During 2011, Duke and Eric Faulkner, the CIO of Federated Sports + Gaming, created the Global poker index (GPI). The index ranks the top 300 live tournament poker players each week.

==Snowbound==
After spending the 2006 Thanksgiving holiday in Seattle, Washington, the Kim family (James, Kati, and their two daughters, 4-year old Penelope and 7-month old Sabine) set out for their home in San Francisco. On Saturday, November 25, 2006, having left Portland, Oregon, on their way to Tu Tu&#x27; Tun Lodge, a resort located near Gold Beach, Oregon, they apparently missed a turnoff from Interstate 5 to Oregon Route 42, a main route to the Oregon Coast. Instead of returning to the exit, they consulted a highway map and picked a secondary route along Bear Camp Road that skirted the Wild Rogue Wilderness, a remote area of southwestern Oregon.

After encountering heavy snow at high elevation on Bear Camp Road, the Kims backtracked and ventured onto BLM Road 34-8-36 (North Fork Galice Creek Road) (), a paved logging road supervised by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) thinking that could be an option. A road gate intended to prevent such mistakes was open despite BLM rules requiring that it be closed. Media outlets reported that vandals had cut a lock on it, but a subsequent investigation showed that BLM employees had left it open to avoid trapping local hunters and others who might have ventured past it.

After 23 miles of slow travel along BLM Road 34-8-36, the Kims stopped at about 1:00 am on November 26 because of fatigue and bad weather (). As more snow fell around their immobilized Saab 9-2X station wagon, they kept warm by running the engine. When it ran out of fuel, they made a campfire of dried wood and magazines. Later, they burned the car&#x27;s tires to signal rescuers. Search efforts began shortly after November 30, when Kim&#x27;s coworkers filed a missing persons report with the San Francisco Police Department. After investigators learned that the Kims used their credit card at a local restaurant, search and rescue teams, including local and state police, more than 80 civilian volunteers, the Oregon Army National Guard and several helicopters hired by Spencer spent several days looking for them along area highways and roads, to no avail.

On December 2, Kim left his family to look for help, wearing tennis shoes, a jacket, and light clothing. He believed the nearest town (Galice) was located four miles away after studying a map with Kati. He promised her he would turn back the same day if he failed to find anyone, but he did not return. He backtracked about 11 miles down BLM Road 34-8-36 before leaving the roadway and electing to follow a ravine northeast down the mountain.

===Search===
Although the Kims had a cellular phone with them, their remote location in the mountains was out of range of the cellular network, rendering the phone unusable for voice calls. Despite it being so, it would play a key role in their rescue. Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a store-and-forward service. Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims&#x27; cell phone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006, at around 1:30am, it made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as tropospheric ducting, can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a line-of-sight to the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.

On the afternoon of December 4, John Rachor, a local helicopter pilot unaffiliated with any formal search effort, spotted Kati, Penelope, and Sabine walking on a remote road. After he radioed their position to authorities, they were airlifted out of the area and transferred to a nearby hospital.

Law enforcement officials said that the discovery of the cellphone connection, and the subsequent analysis of the log data, was the critical breakthrough that ultimately resulted in Kati, Penelope, and Sabine&#x27;s rescue by helicopter.

==Death==

Officials continued to search for Kim, at one point finding clothing that he had discarded along the way in the likely belief that he was too hot; paradoxical undressing is a symptom of hypothermia. Optimistic Oregon officials stated, &quot;These were placed with our belief that little signs are being left by James for anyone that may be trying to find him so that they can continue into the area that he&#x27;s continuing to move in.&quot;

On Wednesday, December 6 at 12:03 p.m., Kim&#x27;s body was found in Big Windy Creek. () Lying on his back in one to two feet of icy water, he was fully clothed and had been carrying a backpack which contained his identification documents, among other miscellaneous items. He had walked about 16.2 miles (26 km) from the car to that point, and was only a mile from Black Bar Lodge, which, although closed for the winter, was fully stocked at the time. An autopsy revealed that he had died of hypothermia and that his body had suffered no incapacitating physical injuries. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy guessed that he had died roughly two days after leaving the car.

===Route===
Because of Kim&#x27;s background as a technology analyst, observers speculated that his family had used online mapping to find their route. However, Kati told state police that they had used a paper road map, an account supported by the Oregon State Police, which reported that they had used an official State of Oregon highway one. Kati later recounted that, after they had been stuck for four days and were studying it for help, both she and Kim noticed that a box in the corner bore the message: &quot;Not all Roads Advisable, Check Weather Conditions&quot;.

Bear Camp Road is lightly used between October and April, even by local residents, because of its difficult terrain, spotty maintenance, steep drop offs, and often inclement weather.
As they drove along the road, the Kims passed three prominent warning signs that state: &quot;Bear Camp Road May Be Blocked By Snowdrifts&quot;. Kati later told police that they had noticed only one.

==Media==

The Kims&#x27; ordeal became a lead story on most major U.S. news networks. In the hours after Kim&#x27;s body was found, it became the highest rated article on MSNBC.com with a reported one million page views. CNN.com reported 755,000 views of its coverage of the story. Within a week, the Kims appeared on the cover of &quot;People&quot; magazine. 

Newspapers in the region, led by &quot;The Oregonian&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, devoted heavy coverage to the events and their aftermath. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; was awarded the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for a distinguished example of local reporting of breaking news, presented in print or online or both, for their coverage of the Kims&#x27; story. The staff of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; was lauded for &quot;its skillful and tenacious coverage of a family missing in the Oregon mountains, telling the tragic story both in print and online&quot;.

On January 6, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an op-ed article written by Kim&#x27;s father, Spencer H. Kim, criticizing various government entities that had in his estimation played roles in his son&#x27;s death. He blamed the BLM for not locking the gate to the logging road, privacy laws that he claimed had delayed the start of search and rescue efforts, local authorities for &quot;confusion, communication breakdowns and failures of leadership&quot; during the search, and the Federal Aviation Administration for not keeping media aircraft out of the search area.

On February 18, 2007, a memorial service was held for Kim at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

On September 12, 2007, Kati gave an exclusive interview of the ordeal to UK blogging site DollyMix.

In December 2009, Kati, Penelope, and Sabine made a surprise appearance at a Christmas party being held by the membership of Josephine County Search and Rescue.

In February 2011, the television show &quot;20/20&quot; aired a special 2-hour episode, &quot;The Wrong Turn&quot;, which included interviews with Kati.

In September 2011, the television show &quot;20/20&quot; aired a second special 2-hour episode, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, which depicted the same story as in &quot;The Wrong Turn&quot;.

On August 27, 2017, the television show &quot;SOS: How to Survive&quot; aired a 1-hour episode, &quot;Trapped in a Blizzard&quot;, which depicted the Kims&#x27; story with survival tips on how to survive in a similar situation.

<doc id="950062" wikidata="Q115958401" url="?curid=950062" title="Highway system in Taiwan">
<text>Highways in Taiwan are classified into five types:
The system does not apply to other parts of Taiwan, namely Kinmen and Lienchiang counties, and islands in the South China Sea.

Expressways in Taiwan may be controlled-access highways similar to National Freeways or limited-access roads. Most have urban roads 
and intra-city expressways (as opposed to Highway system) status, although some are built and maintained by cities.

== Pedestrians ==

Pedestrian is one topic where few progress have been observed, from 429 in 2011 to a high of 458 in 2019 to 410 last year. The number of injured climbed, from 13,787 in 2011 to 15,589 last year.

This record is related to infrastructure and education different from that of other industrialized territories.

==The numbering system==
As a general rule, the odd numbers represent north–south highways and even numbers represent east–west. The numbers increase moving west to east and north to south. Major north-south provincial highways are indicated by a one-digit number. Special routes of a highway use the same number, followed by a heavenly stem character. However, for English translation, these characters are replaced by letters in the alphabetical order.

==National highways==
National highways are freeways with controlled access.

=== History ===
The first controlled-access highway, and a predecessor to the national highways in Taiwan, was the MacArthur Thruway, built in 1964 between Keelung and Taipei. Construction on the first modern national highway, National Highway 1, began in 1971. The northern section between Keelung and Zhongli was completed in 1974, and the entire freeway was completed in 1978. It runs from the northern harbor city of Keelung to the southern harbor city of Kaohsiung, while there was an branch (No. 1A) connecting to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport).

Construction began on the other freeways in the late 1980s. The northern section of the second north–south freeway (National Highway 3) between Xizhi and Hsinchu was completed in 1997. The No. 1A Branch was extended to link No. 3 Freeway at Yingge, Taipei, and renamed as the National Highway 2. Three other short freeways (No. 4, No. 8, and No. 10) were built to link the two north–south freeways in Taichung County (now part of Taichung City), Tainan County (now part of Tainan City), and Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City), respectively. The entire No. 3 Freeway was completed in January 2004.

To ease the congestion of No. 1 Freeway in the Taipei metropolitan area, a viaduct was built in 1997 along the original freeway between Xizhi and the Wugu District of New Taipei to serve as a bypass for traffic not exiting and entering the freeway within Taipei.

The construction of a freeway connecting the Taipei metropolitan area and Yilan County began in 1991 and was completed in June 2006. It includes a tunnel (Hsuehshan Tunnel), which is the ninth-longest road tunnel in the world. An extension from Yilan County to Hualien County is planned. However, its construction is being delayed by environmental concerns.

On January 2, 2014, the toll system was converted to a distance-based one. Tolls are no longer collected at toll booths but automatically by electronic toll collection (ETC).

=== Features ===
==== Length, exits, and entrances ====

Every one tenth of a kilometer is marked on the freeway with Arabic numerals to indicate freeway mileage, which indicates the number of kilometers away from the northern end or western end of the freeway. Exit numbers are based on the freeway mileage. With the notable exception of exit-only signs, which are only expressed in Chinese (but with a right arrow indicating an exit-only lane), exit notification and system route reminder signs in the freeway system are almost identical to their US counterparts.

There are four types of exit notification signs. The first notification sign appears two kilometers before the exit, providing the destination name and an Exit 2 km notice. The second sign appears one kilometer before the exit, providing the destination name and a Right Lane notice. The Right Lane notice warns the exiting driver to start switching to the right lane in preparation to exit and does not necessarily indicate that the right lane is an exit-only lane. The third sign appears a few hundred meters before the exit, providing the destination name and a right tilted arrow. The fourth sign is located at the exit and says Exit with a tilted right arrow.

Exit notification signs were slightly altered in December 2005. The green exit mileage label on top of the exit notification sign has been replaced with a yellow exit mileage label accompanied with the Chinese code name of the interchange. The Chinese code name of the interchange does not necessarily reflect the destinations listed on the exit signs and may represent the general location of the freeway interchange.

Long rectangular-dash dividers usually separate normal lanes. Short rectangular-dash dividers usually indicates a lane that is ready to turn into an exit, a merging lane, or a lane reserved for vehicles that have difficulty climbing high grade regions of the freeway.

Freeway entrances may have traffic lights to control the flow of vehicles entering the freeway.

==== Speed limit ====
The speed limit for cars on Taiwan&#x27;s freeways range from 80 km/h (50 mph) on Freeway No. 5 (north of Toucheng, Yilan) to 110 km/h (68 mph) on Freeway No. 3 (south of Tucheng, New Taipei). The speed limit for trucks are usually 10 km/h lower. In non-traffic jam conditions, a vehicle must travel at least 60 km/h (37 mph).

Speed limits are enforced through radar activated cameras that take pictures of speed-violating cars. Because of protests, yellow warning signs are given in advance in Chinese of approaching radar activated cameras.

==== Following distances ====
As tailgating poses serious hazards of rear-ending, Article 6 of the Freeway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulation () requires the following minimum following distances when the weather is fine:

Longer following distance is required in the Hsuehshan Tunnel.

====Traveling through tunnels====
In the tunnel portions of freeways, lane change is prohibited when the lane divider consists of two parallel solid lines, used when lane change is considered unsafe should a collision cause a vehicular fire. Headlights must be turned on when traveling through tunnels; this is enforced by special cameras. Unlawful lane change or failure to turn on headlights in a tunnel is subject to an administrative fine of 3000 new Taiwan dollars.

Additional restrictions apply for the Hsuehshan Tunnel on Freeway No. 5, which is the longest tunnel in the entire system.
==== Prohibited traffic ====
Article 19 of the Freeway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulation prohibits uses of and entries onto the freeways by:
# Pedestrians.
# Military troops marching or conducting drills.
# Non-motorized vehicles
# Motorcycles (see also Restrictions on motorcycle use on freeways#Taiwan for more information).
# Three-wheel motor vehicles or motorized pedicabs.
# Farm machineries.
# Motorized machineries not being motor vehicles.
# Towed vehicles not disabled on the freeways or expressways.

==== Electronic toll collection ====
Odd-numbered freeways have tolls, which are automatically collected by ETC. The current rate for cars is (NT$1.2/km up to 200 km) + (NT$0.9/excess km), km being kilometers traveled per day. The first 20 km per day is free and thus deducted from the distance. Freeways may be used directly, but users are advised to apply for an “eTag”, which is free and when equipped gives 10% discounts and allows you to store pre-paid money for tolls. The eTag can also be set to pay tolls automatically with credit card or a savings account. Users without the eTag pay tolls at convenience stores 3 days after usage and if not, bills will be mailed to car owners.

=== Service and Rest Areas ===

Freeway service and rest areas start appearing south of Taoyuan City on the No. 1 and No. 3 freeways. Most rest areas provide gas stations, gift shops, convenience stores, and food courts. The Qingshui rest area located on the 172.4 km mileage marker of National Highway No. 3 is so popular that visitors can only park for 45 minutes and are prohibited from barbecuing.

=== List of national highways ===

==Provincial Highways==
Provincial highways (of the Taiwan Province) are administered by Directorate General of Highways under Department of Transportation and Communications since 1999. Before the mid-1990s, the route numbers of provincial highways were limited to 1–27. In 1992, planning started for 12 east–west expressways and the West Coast Expressway, indicated by route numbers greater than 60, to ease the congestion in the freeways. Some of these expressways are still under construction.

Many of these provincial highways cross through the special municipalities (i.e. Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei) which are not part of Taiwan Province. Officially, provincial highways are now known as &quot;Taiwan highways&quot;, but many people still refer to them as provincial roads ().

In 2007, provincial expressways started using the same exit notification signs that national freeways started using in 2006.

Since July 1, 2006, the Freeway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulation () applies the same traffic rules on the freeways to the expressways, including the same prohibited traffic and following distances. While motorcycles remain generally banned from the expressways, Article 19 of the Freeway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulation makes it officially possible to allow a motorcycle with a cylinder capacity of more than 550 cm3 on certain expressways subject to the following restrictions:
#No sharing the same lane to drive side by side with or to overtake another vehicle, not even another motorcycle
#Headlight on at all times

A trial program to allow a motorcycle with a cylinder capacity of more than 550 cm3 on Provincial Highway 68 and Provincial Highway 72 started in January 2005 for one year and was extended an additional year. On July 2, 2006, more than 1500 Taiwanese motorcyclists took to the streets in Taipei to demand more open highways; Provincial Highways 68 and 72 were the only Taiwanese expressways open to high-end motorcycles.

Since 2007, a motorcycle with a cylinder capacity of at least 550 cm3 may be driven on expressways but not freeways. This major change has resulted in mixed reactions.

== County and City Highways ==

County and City Highways are numbered from 101 to 205 since the numbered highways in Penghu (Pescadores) are incorporated into the system. Including those branch lines, there are totally 147 County and City Highways, and the total length stretches over 3,500 kilometres. The lowest number 101 is in New Taipei City. The route numbers generally increase moving north to south. Route No. 200 is in Pingtung. Routes No. 201 to 205 are in Penghu. County Highways numbered 179, 184, 195 are nonexistent.

== Township and District Roads ==


A Township or District Road is prefixed the abbreviation of the county or city in a Chinese character where it is located. For example, the sample signs above show Hsinchu Roads No. 22, 21, and 23.
These roads are almost always two-lane undivided roads. In some situations, they may be narrow and treated like urban alleys or lanes. 

== Special Roads ==
Special Roads in Taiwan are rarely used and appear in certain places.

<text>The German Research Foundation ( ; DFG ) is a German research funding organization, which functions as a self-governing institution for the promotion of science and research in the Federal Republic of Germany. In 2019, the DFG had a funding budget of €3.3 billion.

==Function==
The DFG supports research in science, engineering, and the humanities through a variety of grant programmes, research prizes, and by funding infrastructure. The self-governed organization is based in Bonn and financed by the German states and the federal government of Germany. the organization consists of approximately 100 research universities and other research institutions.

The DFG endows various research prizes, including the Leibniz Prize. The Polish-German science award Copernicus is offered jointly with the Foundation for Polish Science.

According to a 2017 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the DFG has announced it will publish its research in online open-access journals.

==Background==
In 1937, the &quot;Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft&quot; (NG) (&quot;Emergency Association of German Science&quot;) was renamed the &quot;Deutsche Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung und Förderung der Forschung&quot; (&quot;German Foundation for the Preservation and Promotion of Research&quot;), for short known as the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft&quot; (DFG). Even before the election of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi party) to power in 1933, projects funded by the NG had worked diligently on Nazi-aligned research, especially German ethnographic research in Eastern Europe that would lay the foundations for the Hitlerite &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and extermination policies; during the National Socialist period, the NG leadership showed itself ready and willing to adapt to the &quot;new era&quot; by gearing its funding practices towards issues related to German rearmament and autarky, essentially aligning its goals with those of the new regime. By the end of World War II in Germany, in 1945, the DFG was no longer active. In 1949, after formation of the Federal Republic, it was re-founded as the NG and again from 1951 as the DFG.

==Structure==
The legal status of the DFG is that of an association under private law. As such, the DFG can only act through its statutory bodies, in particular through its executive board and the General Assembly.

The DFG is a member of the International Council for Science and has numerous counterparts around the globe such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the National Science Foundation (US) and the Royal Society (UK).

The DFG has several representative offices in Asia, North America and Europe and also maintains the Sino-German Center for Research Promotion, which was jointly founded by the DFG and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. On 9 June 2012, DFG launched a centre in Hyderabad, to expand its presence in India. The German-based research foundation and India&#x27;s Department of Science and Technology are together working on 40 bilateral research projects in science and engineering. The German Research Foundation is a member of Science Europe.

==Heisenberg Programme==
The Heisenberg Programme of the DFG is aimed at young outstanding scientists who meet all the requirements for appointment to a permanent professorship. The programme was named after the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 31. The funding programme aims to enable scientists to prepare for a scientific leadership position and to work on further research topics during this time. The maximum funding period is five years. Normally, the habilitation is a prerequisite for applying for admission to the programme. However, services similar to habilitation are also included in the selection.

The program consists of the following variants:

* The &quot;Heisenberg Scholarship&quot;
* The &quot;Heisenberg position&quot; is a DFG-funded temporary research assistant position at a university.
* The &quot;Heisenberg professorship&quot; a DFG-funded professorship with the aim of establishing a new research area within a scientific focus of the university.
* The &quot;Heisenberg temporary substitute position for clinicians&quot; is intended for clinically working scientists who can take some time off for research.

<text>Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (26 July 1791 – 29 July 1844), also known as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Jr., was the youngest child of six born to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his wife Constanze and the younger of his parents&#x27; two surviving children. He was a composer, pianist, conductor, and teacher of the late classical period whose musical style was of an early Romanticism, heavily influenced by his father&#x27;s mature style. He knew Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, both of whom held him in high esteem.

==Biography==
Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart was born in Vienna, four months and ten days before his father&#x27;s death. Although he was baptized Franz Xaver Mozart, he was always called Wolfgang by his family. He received excellent musical instruction from Antonio Salieri and Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and studied composition with Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and Sigismund von Neukomm. He learned to play both the piano and violin. Like his father, he started to compose at an early age. &quot;In April 1805, the thirteen-year-old Wolfgang Mozart made his debut in Vienna in a concert in the Theater an der Wien.&quot;

Mozart became a professional musician and enjoyed moderate success both as a teacher and a performer. Unlike his father, he was introverted and given to self-deprecation. He constantly underrated his talent and feared that whatever he produced would be compared with what his father had done.

Needing money, in 1808, he traveled to Lemberg (now Lviv), where he gave music lessons to the daughters of the Polish count Wiktor Baworowski. Although the pay was good, Franz felt lonely in the town of Pidkamin, near Rohatyn, so in 1809 he accepted an offer from another Polish aristocrat, the imperial chamberlain, Count von Janiszewski, to teach his daughters music in the town of Burshtyn. Besides teaching, he gave local concerts, playing his own and his father&#x27;s pieces. These concerts introduced him to the important people in Galicia.

After two years in Burshtyn, he moved to Lemberg (Lviv) in 1813 where he spent 25 years teaching (with students including Julie von Webenau, née Baroni-Cavalcabò) and giving concerts. Between 1826 and 1829, he conducted the choir of Saint Cecilia which consisted of 400 amateur singers. In 1826, he conducted his father&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; during a concert at the Ukrainian Greek Catholic cathedral of St. George. From this choir, he created the musical brotherhood of Saint Cecilia and thus the first school of music in Lemberg. He did not give up performing and in the years 1819 to 1821, traveled throughout Europe. In 1819, he gave concerts in Warsaw, Elbing and Danzig (Gdańsk).

In the 1820s, Mozart was one of 50 composers to write a variation on a theme of Anton Diabelli for part II of the &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot;. Part I was devoted to the 33 variations supplied by Beethoven which have gained an independent identity as his &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot; Op. 120. Around that time, Mozart made the acquaintance of Schubert and the two became close until Schubert’s 1828 death.

In 1838, Mozart left for Vienna, and then for Salzburg, where he was appointed as the &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of the Mozarteum. From 1841, he taught the pianist Ernst Pauer. Mozart died from stomach cancer on 29 July 1844, in the town of Karlsbad (now Karlovy Vary) where he was buried.

Like his brother, he was unmarried and childless. His will was executed by Josephine de Baroni-Cavalcabò (1788–1860), a longtime patron to whom he dedicated his cello sonata. 

The shadow of his father loomed large over him even in death. The following epitaph was etched on his tombstone: &quot;May the name of his father be his epitaph, as his veneration for him was the essence of his life.&quot;

== Works by genre==
Franz Xaver Wolfgang had a relatively small output (his opus numbers only go up to 30) and after 1820 he seems to have given up composing almost entirely; in particular, there is an 11-year gap (1828 to 1839) when he seems to have not written anything. Nevertheless, recordings of his music can be found today. He wrote mainly chamber music and piano music, with his largest compositions being the two piano concertos.

Orchestral works
* Sinfonia
* Overture in D major

Concertante
* Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major, Op. 14 (1808, published in 1811)
* Piano Concerto No. 2 in E-flat major, Op. 25 (1818)
The two piano concertos differ somewhat. The first concerto could pass for one of his father&#x27;s late (K. 550 and above) works, except for a youthful exuberance and the piano&#x27;s tessitura which had been expanded in 1795, just after Mozart senior died. The second concerto is more contemporary to the 1810s with a more virtuosic piano part showing hints that the younger Mozart was developing his own style.

==Liszt misattribution==
Franz Xaver Mozart&#x27;s Five Variations on a romance from Méhul&#x27;s &quot;Joseph&quot;, Op. 23, was published in 1820. But the work was until 1994 mistakenly attributed to the young Liszt: a copyist&#x27;s manuscript of the work wrongly noted that it was &quot;par le jeune Liszt&quot; (by the young Liszt). The work was published in good faith by the &quot;&quot; in 1990 and catalogued as Liszt&#x27;s S147a. Liszt scholar Leslie Howard recorded the work in similar good faith in 1992 for his series of recordings of the complete music for solo piano by Liszt (for the disc entitled &quot;The Young Liszt&quot;). But shortly afterwards Howard noted in his sleeve notes for the disc&#x27;s release: It has since been established that the attribution is false and that the work is from the pen of Mozart’s son Franz Xaver and was published as his opus 23 in 1820. But since the work remains unknown and unrecorded, like the vast majority of F X Mozart&#x27;s output, and since the writing is not vastly different from some of the other pieces in this collection, it was thought best not to discard it.

<text>Baron Levin Rauch de Nyék (; 6 October 1819 – 25 August 1890) was an Austrian-Hungarian politician and appointed Ban of Croatia-Slavonia between 1867 and 1871. He is most notable for securing victory of the Unionist Party through changing the election law and terrorising those who were able to vote.

==Life==

His father was Dániel &quot;Freiherr&quot; Rauch de Nyék (1778–1831), while his mother was Erzsébet Farkas de Nagyjóka (1787–1858). His grandfather was Pál &quot;Freiherr&quot; Rauch de Nyék (c.1739–1815), colonel, who received on 6 April 1763 from Queen Maria Theresia the title of &quot;Freiherr&quot; (or Baron). His paternal grandmother was Anna Szegedy de Mezőszeged. Pál Freiherr Rauch de Nyék was promoted to major-general in 1765.

Rauch was a member of the unionist party that advocated an integration of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary. After the Revolutions of 1848, Croatia became a Habsburg crown territory separate from Hungary, but when the Austrian-Hungarian Ausgleich was signed, Austria-Hungary was created and Rauch was appointed as the acting &quot;ban&quot; (or viceroy) of Croatia on 27 June 1867. By this, the Croatian autonomy within the Hungarian kingdom was automatically abolished. During this time a new Croatian–Hungarian Settlement was negotiated and put in effect by which Croatia reinstated some of its earlier , but also lost some other rights. Rauch was made the official ban on 8 December 1868 and remained in office until 26 January 1871.

<text>An athletic director (commonly &quot;athletics director&quot; or &quot;AD&quot;) is an administrator at many American clubs or institutions, such as colleges and universities, as well as in larger high schools and middle schools, who oversees the work of coaches and related staff involved in athletic programs.

==Position at institution==
Modern athletic directors are often in a precarious position, especially at the larger institutions. Although technically in charge of all the coaches, they are often far less well-compensated and also less famous, with few having their own television and radio programs as many coaches now do. In attempting to deal with misconduct by coaches, they often find their efforts trumped by a coach&#x27;s powerful connections, particularly if the coach is an established figure with a long-term winning record. However, in the case of severe coaching misconduct being proven, often the athletic director will be terminated along with the offending coach.

Over the last several years, the role of an athletic director has changed dramatically. Before, the athletic department was overseen by one of the school&#x27;s head coaches. Now, the position attracts executives inside and outside the sports industry. Athletic directors can negotiate multimillion-dollar media deals and can manage powerful coaches, who are usually the highest paid employees in the state. Based on the division and the school&#x27;s athletic needs, athletic directors can also be in charge of scheduling games and events, monitoring a team&#x27;s players and making sure coaches, players and anyone who is heavily involved with the department are complying with all the sports agency&#x27;s regulations. A bachelor&#x27;s degree is required for all divisions, and a master&#x27;s degree is preferred by larger schools. These degrees normally consist of sports management, psychology, physical education and business management. The top athletic directors in high school have an average salary ranging from $58,400 to $87,000. In 2013, the highest paid athletic director at the NCAA Division I level was David Williams of Vanderbilt who was paid $3,239,678. However, Williams&#x27; salary was at the time not directly comparable to that of other Division I athletic directors because of Vanderbilt&#x27;s unique administrative structure for varsity athletics. Unlike all other Division I schools, Vanderbilt athletics were then governed directly by the university (specifically within its Division for Student Life) rather than administered by a separate athletic department. Effectively, Vanderbilt athletics were treated as any other student organization. Williams&#x27; athletic duties were part of his position as Vanderbilt&#x27;s vice president for student life. The university has since returned to a more traditional Division I model of a separate athletic department, with Williams returning to the formal title of athletic director; he resigned from that role shortly before his death in 2019.

==Coaches as athletic directors==
Formerly, especially at major football-playing institutions, particularly in the South, the head football coach was also the &quot;AD&quot;. Among the coaches to hold simultaneously hold the AD position were Bear Bryant (Texas A&amp;M and Alabama), Ray Perkins (Alabama), Frank Broyles (Arkansas), Pat Dye (Auburn), Ray Graves (Florida), Wally Butts (Georgia), Vince Dooley (Georgia), Charles Shira (Mississippi State), Bud Wilkinson (Oklahoma), Robert Neyland (Tennessee), Darrell Royal (Texas), Emory Bellard (Texas A&amp;M) and John McKay (USC). This was usually done in a nominal sense, giving the coach additional prestige, additional pay, and the knowledge that the only supervision that he was under was that of the college president or chancellor and perhaps an athletics committee, and such supervision was often token. An associate athletics director actually performed the functions of athletic director on a daily basis in the name of the coach. At a few institutions where basketball was the predominant sport, the head men&#x27;s basketball coach was treated similarly. In recent decades, this system has been almost entirely abandoned; collegiate sports, especially in its compliance aspects, has become far too complicated an undertaking to be run on a part-time basis. The last football coach to hold both positions at a major university was Derek Dooley at Louisiana Tech before leaving to become head coach at Tennessee after the 2009 season.

Broyles retired as Arkansas football coach in 1976, but remained as Razorbacks athletic director through 2007. Dooley retired as Georgia football coach in 1988, but remained as athletic director well into the 2000s.

LSU was one of the exceptions to the rule in the south. Football coach Charles McClendon nearly bolted for Texas A&amp;M when he was offered the combined position of football coach and athletic director by the Aggies in January 1972, but remained in Baton Rouge after successful lobbying by LSU athletic director Carl Maddox and Louisiana Governor John McKeithen.

Kentucky always kept its coaching and athletic director positions separate, even during the period (1946–1953) when Bear Bryant coached football and Adolph Rupp coached men&#x27;s basketball. Even though Bryant and Rupp were technically equals under athletic director Bernie Shively, Bryant chafed under the impression he was far less powerful and far less revered than Rupp, a main factor in his departure from Lexington.

Paul Dietzel (LSU) and Tom Osborne (Nebraska) coached the football teams at their respective schools to national championships and later came back as athletic director after working elsewhere. Dietzel left LSU following the 1961 football season and coached at Army and South Carolina before returning to LSU as AD in 1978. Osborne served three terms in the United States House of Representatives after coaching the Cornhuskers from 1973 through 1997; he returned to Nebraska as AD in 2007.

Johnny Vaught, who coached Ole Miss to a share of the 1960 national championship, was not the Rebels&#x27; athletic director during his original 24-year tenure (1947–1970) as football coach, but was re-hired as coach and also given the duties of athletic director three games into the 1973 season. Vaught stepped down as football coach at the end of the 1973 season, but remained as athletic director until 1978. 

Additionally, most of the old-line coaches who demanded such total control as a condition of employment have since either retired (or in Dooley&#x27;s case, forced out) or died (Bryant died four weeks after coaching his final football game at Alabama), leaving in place a new generation who are not desirous of such an arrangement, if it were to be made available, and additionally have developed other sources of income, such as shoe contracts and radio and television appearance fees and endorsement contracts, that make the income which might come from the additional duty of athletic director unnecessary.

Increasingly, college athletic directors are less likely to be retired or active coaches with physical education or sports administration degrees and more likely to be persons who majored in business administration or a related field. The budget for a major athletic department of a large American university is now routinely at the level of tens of millions of dollars; such enterprises demand professional management. Athletic directors have their own professional organization in the U.S., the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics.

Other individuals may be referred to as athletic directors. As mentioned above, many U.S. high schools have someone who performs this duty at least on a part-time basis, usually in conjunction with another coaching or administrative position; some school districts have a full-time director of athletics. Additionally, corporations which sponsor recreational or competitive sports may employ an athletic director.

<doc id="950085" wikidata="Q7545365" url="?curid=950085" title="Smith and Goody">
<text>Smith and Goody is a children&#x27;s sketch show on ITV from the 1980s. It was made for the ITV network by Thames Television. It starred, and was written by Mel Smith (at the time, part of the &quot;Not The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; show on BBC2) and Bob Goody, with music provided by Peter Brewis. As well as being a comedy, the series had tried to advocate literature. It was set in a flat in which books, newspapers and magazines were in abundance and the sketches were designed to encourage young people to enjoy reading.

Smith and Goody, one short and the other very tall, made for the stereotypical double-act partnership, and had worked together since meeting at drama school, putting together a joint production at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

There was a Christmas Special, &quot;Smith And Goody On Ice&quot;, which largely abandoned the educational book-led format in favour of a bunch of sketches and running about.

==Theme tune==
The opening credits began with cartoon renditions of the presenters engaged in a friendly exchange:
&quot;Mel: Whatcha Bob&quot;
&quot;Bob: Whatcha Mel&quot;
&quot;Mel: Whatcha been up to?&quot;
&quot;Bob: Can&#x27;t you tell?&quot;
&quot;Bob: I&#x27;ve been having a look at a book mate&quot;
&quot;Bob: I&#x27;ve been taking a squint at the print&quot;
&quot;Bob: I&#x27;ve been thumbing through the pages of a paperback a day&quot;
Bob: &quot;and I&#x27;ll tell you something more if you&#x27;re in-ter-es-ted&quot;
The chorus went something like:
&quot;Good books, bad books,funny books, never been had books&quot;
&quot;G&quot;ood books, bad books, funny books, never been had books&quot;&quot;
&quot;There&#x27;s a book about a plane that disappeared without a trace&quot;,&quot;
&quot;There&#x27;s a book about a man who came from outer space&quot;&quot;
&quot;Mel: Tell you what, Bob. What&#x27;s next?&quot;

<doc id="950088" wikidata="Q5930574" url="?curid=950088" title="Hugh Douglas (American football)">
<text>Hugh Lamont Douglas (born August 23, 1971) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL). His playing career included stints with the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles (twice), and the Jacksonville Jaguars. In his first season in 1995, Douglas was named Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press.

Douglas currently hosts the 94.1 WIP Midday Show in Philadelphia. He previously served as a football analyst for ESPN.

==Early life==
Douglas was born in Mansfield, Ohio and attended Mansfield Senior High School.

==College career==
At Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, Douglas majored in elementary education and was a two-time NAIA Division I All-American, made 42 sacks in 32 games in a three-year career, turned in 13 multiple-sack games, and helped lead his team to an NAIA national championship as a . As a senior, Douglas was named Defensive Player of the Year by The Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C. He is also a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

==NFL career==
Douglas was a first-round draft choice of the Jets in the 1995 NFL draft and was traded to the Eagles prior to the 1998 season for draft picks in the second and fifth round. The Jets would then send the second round pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers for three further picks, in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th round. Those picks would become Dorian Boose, Kevin Williams, and Eric Bateman. The second Philadelphia pick would be used on Casey Dailey. None of the four would leave any sort of lasting mark in the NFL. Douglas spent the 2003 campaign with the Jaguars before re-signing with Philadelphia in 2004. Douglas is ranked sixth behind Reggie White (124), Trent Cole (85.5), Brandon Graham (76.5), Clyde Simmons (76), and Fletcher Cox (70) on the Eagles&#x27; all-time sack list with 54.5 during his six seasons.

Douglas was cut by the Eagles prior to the 2005 season, but was hired into the front office position of &quot;Good-Will Ambassador&quot; shortly after.

On November 5, 2005, Douglas was reportedly involved in an altercation with former Eagles teammate Terrell Owens, who was in the midst of a very public war of words with the team. Owens was suspended by the team and was later deactivated when he refused to fully apologize for the altercation, as well as for derogatory remarks made about Eagles&#x27; quarterback Donovan McNabb.

==NFL career statistics==
=== Regular season ===
===Playoffs===
==Broadcasting career==

Douglas was employed for a while as an on-air reporter with WTXF-TV in Philadelphia and in 2005 joined 610 WIP a regular personality on Philadelphia&#x27;s sports radio station.

In January 2011, Douglas was named co-host of a Six Nations Championship rugby show on BBC America following a successful guest appearance. In his taped segments, Douglas took a stab at the sport, interviewed zookeepers and took an Irish stepdancing lesson.

On August 1, 2011 ESPN announced that Douglas would join the network as an NFL studio analyst. He provided analysis across a myriad of studio programs such as SportsCenter, NFL Live, First Take and ESPNews.

In September 2012, Douglas joined Jalen Rose as a full-time analyst on ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;Numbers Never Lie&quot;, but was fired on August 13, 2013, after reportedly calling colleague Michael Smith an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;.

Douglas worked for 92.9 The Game sports talk radio station in Atlanta, GA from 2015 until 2023.

On February 20, 2023, Douglas returned to Philadelphia to co-host the Midday Show with Joe Giglio on 94.1 WIP.

<text>Jonathan Samuel Carroll (born January 26, 1949) is an American fiction writer primarily known for novels that may be labelled magic realism, slipstream or contemporary fantasy. He has lived in Austria since 1974.

== Life and work ==
Carroll was born in New York City to Sidney Carroll, a film writer whose credits included &quot;The Hustler&quot;, and June Carroll (née Sillman), an actress and lyricist who appeared in numerous Broadway shows and two films. He is the half brother of composer Steve Reich and nephew of Broadway producer Leonard Sillman. His parents were Jewish, but Carroll was raised in the Christian Science religion. A self-described &quot;troubled teenager&quot;, he finished primary education at the Loomis School in Connecticut and graduated with honors from Rutgers University in 1971, marrying artist Beverly Schreiner in the same year. He relocated to Vienna, Austria a few years later and began teaching literature at the American International School, and has made his home in Austria ever since.

His first novel, &quot;The Land of Laughs&quot; (1980), is indicative of his general style and subject matter. Told through realistic first person narration, the novel concerns a young schoolteacher, Thomas Abbey, researching the life of a favorite children&#x27;s book author of his youth, which involves meeting the author&#x27;s daughter in her and her late father&#x27;s seemingly idyllic (fictitious) home town of Galen, Missouri. Everything seems fine until a dog in Galen begins talking to Abbey. The line gradually blurs between the fantasy world created by Abbey&#x27;s research subject and the life of the people in Galen, while the reader begins to wonder just how much trust can be placed in this narrator. Subsequent novels would expand on these themes, but often contain unreliable narrators in a world where magic is viewed as natural. (One commentator claimed in &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;if he were a Latin American writer with a three-part name, his books would be described as magical-realist&quot;.)

His son, Ryder Carroll, is the inventor of the Bullet Journal.

==Awards==
Carroll&#x27;s short story, &quot;Friend&#x27;s Best Man&quot;, won the World Fantasy Award. His novel, &quot;Outside the Dog Museum&quot; won the British Fantasy Award and his collection of short stories won the Bram Stoker Award. The short story &quot;Uh-Oh City&quot; won the French Grand Prix de l&#x27;Imaginaire. His short story &quot;Home on the Rain&quot; was chosen as one of the best stories of the year by the Pushcart Prize committee. Carroll has been a runner-up for other World Fantasy Awards, the Hugo, and British Fantasy Awards.

<doc id="950093" wikidata="Q7139699" url="?curid=950093" title="Parque del Retiro">
<text>Parque del Retiro (English: Retirement Park) is the only senior citizens-oriented passive park in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It is located in barrio Canas Urbano. The park commemorated its 30th anniversary on 11 February 2010. It has a &quot;steady attendance&quot; of some 70 senior citizens. The park&#x27;s oldest member is 91 years old. The park&#x27;s managing ranger is Roberto Castro Franceschi.

==Location==
The park is located on Villa street, between the Clausells and Baldorioty sectors of barrio Canas Urbano. The area is a mixed residential/commercial area on urban route PR-123. The park sits on an underprivileged sector of the city. The park is a self-contained non-profit entity. It is managed by the Ponce municipal government. It serves exclusively the City’s elderly population. The park is set &quot;in a calming setting among lush mahogany, avocado, almond, lemon and flamboyán trees.&quot;

==History==

In the late 1960s, the park was an empty city lot with many tall trees, very few bushes and shrubbery, and some open semi-grassy areas. Senior citizens of the area gravitated to the empty lot in the afternoons for its comfortable shade and for the inevitable conversations with other retired neighborhood seniors. With time, the senior made their way to the park with scrap chairs to make their longer stays more comfortable. It wasn&#x27;t long before a table or two also found their way there, making it possible for the retired seniors to share in a game of domino. Soon the domino games became a regular feature of the daily gatherings. It was not long before the still-empty government lot had been &quot;appropriated&quot; by the seniors for their daily gatherings and domino games. The daily games gathered popularity and after a few years domino tournaments also took place. At this time the park was locally known as Las Vegas, &quot;for its popular open-air kiosks with 12 game tables&quot;.

In view of the need for a clean and safe gathering place for the seniors of the area, the city, fixed the &quot;park&quot;, built permanently set poured concrete tables and chairs, added flower gardens with walkways as well as restroom facilities. The park was then inaugurated in 1980, under the administration of mayor José G. Tormos Vega.

==A senior citizens center==
The park also serves as the center for an array of community services oriented towards the senior citizens community. Within the park are the offices of the non-profit organization running the park. It has an eight-member staff including a social worker, a nurse, and a recreation leader.

Some of the free services the park offers are: 
*Health clinics with physicians
*Escorted transportation to medical appointments
*Especially adapted exercises and physical education programs, including strolls at other passive city parks
*Guided cultural day tours to out-of-town attractions
*Summer weekend-long outings to island beaches
*Annual Christmas, Thanksgiving, Holy Week, Mother&#x27;s and Father&#x27;s Day celebrations.
*Social exchange trips to other similar groups in the island
*Domino tournaments area schoolchildren
*Talent shows and educational lectures oriented to the senior citizen population.

==Reforestation effort==
In November 2009, Parque del Retiro was selected for green reforestation effort sponsored by Telemundo, Doral Bank and the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

<doc id="950106" wikidata="Q947326" url="?curid=950106" title="Howard Lederer">
<text>Howard Henry Lederer (born October 30, 1964) is an American professional poker player. He has won two World Series of Poker bracelets and holds two World Poker Tour titles. Lederer has also contributed to several books on poker strategy and has provided commentary for poker programming. He is known by poker fans and players as &quot;The Professor&quot; and is the older brother of professional poker player Annie Duke.

Lederer is a founder and board member of Tiltware, the company that launched Full Tilt Poker in 2004. In 2011, the Full Tilt Poker website was shut down by the United States Department of Justice on charges of bank fraud and illegal gambling. In December 2012, Lederer settled a civil lawsuit with the Department of Justice relating to Full Tilt Poker.

==Early life and family==
Lederer was born in 1964 in Concord, New Hampshire and was introduced to card games at a young age by his family. As a child, Lederer&#x27;s father also taught him to play chess. As a teenager, Lederer developed an interest in playing the game competitively. Lederer&#x27;s sister, Annie Duke, is also a professional poker player. His father, Richard Lederer, is an author, linguist and a former educator at St. Paul&#x27;s School. His other sister, Katy Lederer, is also an author. His father is Jewish, while his mother was a gentile. He was not raised Jewish.

==Professional poker career==
===Early career===
After graduating from high school, Lederer began playing chess in New York City before discovering and developing an interest in live poker games and becoming a member of the Mayfair Club. Though he briefly attended Columbia University, Lederer ultimately decided to pursue a career in poker. It was during his time in New York City that Lederer began to mentor his sister, Annie Duke, who was playing poker in Billings, Montana at the time.

Lederer attempted to qualify for a World Series of Poker (WSOP) event in 1986, but was unsuccessful. The next year, he made the final table and finished fifth in the $10,000 no limit Hold &#x27;em Main Event. In 1993, Lederer moved to Las Vegas to focus on his poker career.

===Live poker===
Between 1993 and 1999, Lederer made eight final tables at WSOP events, before winning his first WSOP bracelet in 2000, in a $5,000 limit Omaha Hi/Lo tournament. Lederer won his second WSOP bracelet in 2001 in a $5,000 no limit Deuce to Seven tournament. Some of Lederer&#x27;s other notable live poker wins in the early 2000s include World Poker Tour (WPT) titles in 2002 and 2003, in addition to two first-place finishes at WPT events in 2004.

In 2008, Lederer won more than $1 million Australian dollars at the Aussie Millions High-Roller event. Two years later, he won $250,000 and placed second in the WSOP&#x27;s Tournament of Champions.

As of 2022, Lederer&#x27;s total live tournament winnings exceeded $6,500,000, with his last cash being in January 2011. His 44 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,587,702 of those winnings.

Lederer is also known as &quot;The Professor&quot;, a nickname given to him by poker player and commentator Jesse May. According to Lederer, the nickname came &quot;out of nowhere&quot;. More recently, this nickname has been attributed to Lederer&#x27;s strategic approach to poker as well as his instructional style.

====World Series of Poker Bracelets====
===Other poker activities===
In addition to live poker tournaments, Lederer has been involved in a number of other poker related activities. As of 2011, Lederer had appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;, a late-night poker program, fourteen times. He provided commentary for poker programming, including the &quot;Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament&quot;, &quot;Learn from the Pros,&quot; as well as other Fox Sports Network poker programs. He has also released instructional videos on poker, contributed to several books on poker strategy, including &quot;The Full Tilt Poker Strategy Guide&quot;, and hosted several poker fantasy camps in the mid-2000s. Additionally, from June 2006 to May 2011, Lederer was a member of the Poker Players Alliance&#x27;s board of directors.

==Tiltware LLC and Full Tilt Poker==
Lederer was a founding member and onetime president of Tiltware LLC, the company that handled marketing and software development for Full Tilt Poker. Tiltware LLC launched Full Tilt Poker in 2004. Lederer served on the company&#x27;s board of directors along with co-founders Rafe Furst, Chris Ferguson, and Ray Bitar. Full Tilt Poker hosted online poker games and was a former sponsor of poker programming on ESPN and &quot;Poker After Dark,&quot; both in the United States and abroad.

Following a United States Department of Justice-led investigation, based on suspicion of money laundering and gambling violations, Full Tilt Poker&#x27;s website was closed to players in the United States on April 15, 2011. The company&#x27;s license was suspended on June 30, 2011, and Full Tilt Poker stopped accepting international play.

In September 2011, Lederer was named, along with two other members of the Full Tilt Poker board of directors, in an amended civil complaint filed by the Department of Justice, in which Full Tilt Poker was accused of defrauding poker players. Ultimately, the company&#x27;s owners were accused of receiving around $443 million in player funds between 2007 and 2011. According to the Department of Justice, Lederer received about $42 million in payments from Full Tilt Poker during that time period. In a statement issued by the Department of Justice, Full Tilt Poker was referred to as a Ponzi scheme for paying out funds to Full Tilt Poker owners despite having insufficient funds to cover money owed to players. Full Tilt Poker denied the allegation that they operated a Ponzi scheme.

In 2012, a three-way settlement was reached between Full Tilt Poker, PokerStars, and the Department of Justice. Full Tilt Poker agreed to forfeit their assets to the Department of Justice and on the same day, PokerStars agreed to acquire those assets from the Department of Justice. As part of the agreement, PokerStars paid $547 million to the Department of Justice in addition to $184 million to poker players outside the United States who were owed money by Full Tilt Poker. Additionally, $150 million from the settlement money was intended to be used to refund U.S.-based customers.

Lederer personally settled with the Department of Justice in December 2012. He admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to forfeit assets totaling more than $2.5 million.

==Charitable activities==
Lederer and his wife Suzie have previously hosted charity poker events including their April Fools fundraiser in 2009 to support the Las Vegas Springs Preserve. The Lederers have also hosted the Suzie and Howard Lederer Celebrity Charity Tourney, in 2009 and 2010, as part of their annual World Series of Barbecue event in Las Vegas. The charity poker event was a benefit for the Boys and Girls Club of Las Vegas. Lederer has also participated in other charity poker events including Put a Bad Beat on Cancer in 2009.

== Personal life ==
Though previously overweight, Lederer was able to lose weight as a result of gastric bypass surgery. In an interview in 2006, Lederer stated that he is a vegetarian. Lederer moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1993, where he lives with his wife, Suzie, and his son, Mattias.

<text>Nelson is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Pendle in Lancashire, England, it had a population of 29,135 in the 2011 Census. Nelson is north of Burnley and south-west of Colne. Nelson developed as a mill town during the Industrial Revolution.

==History==
An Iron Age hillfort called Castercliff is on a hill to the east of the town. The modern town spans the two parts of the township of Marsden in the ancient parish of Whalley. Little Marsden was on the south-west of Walverden Water, its lands considered part of the manor of Ightenhill and Great Marsden to the north-east, part of the manor of Colne. Great Marsden included the southern parts of Colne, and Little Marsden included all of modern-day Brierfield.

Walverden Water joins Pendle Water next to Nelson &amp; Colne College, with that river forming the boundary of the Forest of Pendle. Both the manors and forest were parts of the Honour of Clitheroe. The lord of Clitheroe had a mill on the river in 1311, thought to have been sited near the confluence with Clough Head Beck, where Scholefield Mill now stands. There is also evidence of an ancient fulling mill further upstream. A small chapel is thought to have been built during the reign of Henry VIII on the site of St Paul&#x27;s Church.

The forest of Pendle was made famous by the Pendle witch trials of 1612. One of the accused in the less well-known witch trials of 1634, Margaret Johnson, confessed that she first met her familiar in Marsden.

A small mill had been established by the Ecroyd family at Edge End as early as 1740, and they started Lomeshaye Mill as a water-powered spinning mill in 1780. The coming of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1796, followed by the East Lancashire Railway Line in 1849, spurred its development as an industrial town, with an economy based mainly upon cotton weaving. The first Ordnance Survey map of the area, published in 1848, shows three small villages: Marsden (around St Paul&#x27;s), and Hebson and Bradley, both on Walverden Water in the modern-day centre of town. Also apparent are the estates of Marsden Hall to the east and Carr Hall across Pendle Water to the north-west, as well as the turnpike roads of the Marsden, Gisburn and Long Preston trust (Scotland Road) heading north, and the Blackburn, Addingham and Cocking End trust (Manchester Road) heading east.

Brierfield railway station was originally called Marsden, and Nelson railway station was known as the Nelson Inn station, Great Marsden, after the adjacent public house, the Lord Nelson Inn (named after Admiral Lord Nelson). As the villages developed into a town, the name Nelson was chosen to differentiate it from Marsden across the Pennines in the neighbouring (West Riding of Yorkshire).
There was a worsted mill at Lomeshaye close to a &quot;cotton factory&quot; and another cotton mill along the canal at Reedyford by 1848. Walverden Mill in Leeds Road was built in 1850, and it was soon followed by others. From 1862, Phoenix Foundry, the steam engine factory of William Roberts, stood at the site of the shopping centre&#x27;s car park, and has been called &quot;Nelson&#x27;s most significant engineering site&quot;. By 1891, there were 57 cotton spinners and manufacturers listed in Nelson. The largest had 1,950 looms and the smallest only 8.

The cotton industry was the most important in the town, and by 1910, more than 12,000 local workers were members of the Nelson and District Power-Loom Weavers&#x27; Association.

Nelson is considered part of the Burnley Coalfield. There is evidence of old bell pits and surface mining at Swinden Clough and Castercliff, and as early as 1465 there was a complaint of people unlawfully digging coal in the area. Clough Head Colliery, also known as Town House Pit, was on Clough Head Beck on the eastern edge of the town and it had a troubled history. While under construction in 1845, an accident during assembly of the steam pumping engine resulted in the death of one worker. On 12 April 1850, six men were working in the pit when one man went to check for gas with a safety lamp, but before he had signalled it was safe, another man opened his lamp causing an explosion that killed them all. Another explosion in November 1856 resulted in two fatalities. A surface tramroad connected it to railway sidings at Bradley Lane Head. It is uncertain when the colliery closed, but it was possibly in the late 1880s.

The town became associated in the 20th century with the production of confectionery, including Jelly Babies and Victory V, and it was where the package holiday company Airtours (formerly Pendle Travel and now part of Thomas Cook) began life as an independent travel agent. The textile industry, in particular, has now sharply declined, leaving the town with low property prices and higher than average unemployment.

==Governance==
Nelson was granted its charter of incorporation as a municipal borough by Queen Victoria in 1890. Radical left wing politics in the early 20th century led to it being labelled &quot;Little Moscow&quot; by both the local and national press; indeed, the Nelson Leader ran the headline &quot;Moscow calling&quot; during the lock-out of 1928. There was significant Communist Party influence in the town between the wars. When the Labour Party came to power in the town, they responded to local political feeling by placing utilities such as gas and water under the control of the municipal council, anticipating by decades the nationalisation of such utilities after World War II. The council refused, moreover, to participate in celebrations for King George V&#x27;s silver jubilee in 1935, saying that they would rather spend public money on free dinners for school children and the jobless.
Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town became part of the non-metropolitan district of Pendle on 1 April 1974. Initially forming part of an unparished area, a new Nelson civil parish was formed in 2008, covering a similar area to the old municipal borough. It currently has three tiers of local government, Lancashire County Council, Pendle Borough Council and a town council, with 24 councillors, which was elected for the first time on 1 May 2008. Nelson Town Council and the wider Pendle Borough Council are situated at Nelson Town Hall on Market Square.

After boundary changes in 2020 which reduced the number of wards in the borough to 12, four cover parts of Nelson parish – Bradley, Brierfield East &amp; Clover Hill, Marsden &amp; Southfield and Whitefield &amp; Walverden. Pendle Borough Council is currently under &#x27;No Overall Control&#x27; and governed by a coalition of independents and Liberal Democrats, led by Councillor Mohammed Iqbal. The mayor is a ceremonial post, rotated annually.
Lancashire County Council was governed from 1994 to 2009 by Labour, at which point it switched to Conservative control, then to no overall control in 2013, and back to Conservative in 2017. The town is represented on the council in three divisions: Brierfield &amp; Nelson North, Nelson South, and Pendle Central.

The Member of Parliament for Pendle and Clitheroe, the constituency into which the town falls, is Jonathan Hinder (Labour), who was first elected in 2024.

==Demography==

The United Kingdom Census 2011 showed a total resident population for Nelson civil parish of 29,135. The town forms part of the wider urban area, which had a population of 149,796 in 2001. A similar but larger, Burnley Built-up area defined in the 2011 census had a population of 149,422.

The racial composition of the town in 2011 was 52.8% White (44% White British), 45.4% Asian, 0.1% Black, 1.5% Mixed and 0.2% Other. The largest religious groups are Christian (39.0%) and Muslim (37.6%). 59.9% of adults between the ages of 16 and 74 are classed as economically active and in work.

==Economy==

The town centre contains the largest number of high street multiples of any town in the Borough of Pendle. Stores currently include: Boots, Specsavers, Home Bargains, Peacocks, Greggs, Post Office, and Martin McColl.

The &quot;Pendle Rise Shopping Centre&quot; has been the focal point of the town centre for over 50 years. It opened as the &quot;Arndale Centre&quot; in June 1967 and was rebranded as the &quot;Admiral Shopping Centre&quot; before taking its current name. &quot;Nelson Market&quot; (previously &quot;Admiral&#x27;s Market&quot;) is a covered market below the &quot;Pendle Rise Shopping Centre&quot;. &quot;The Victory Centre&quot; opened on the site of the former Salem Chapel in 1993. Of the 12 units only one remained occupied in 2017, by a branch of William Hill.

The main road through the town centre, pedestrianised in the early 1990s, was reopened to traffic in August 2011, to help boost trade. In 2012, Nelson was among twelve English towns chosen to participate in the Portas Pilot Areas initiative, receiving £100,000 to help rejuvenate the shopping area.

The largest business park in the town is located at Lomeshaye, by Junction 12 of the M65. The original 15-hectare site was designated as an Enterprise Zone on 7 December 1983. The estate currently occupies 53 hectares and is home to more than 80 businesses. Between them they employ approximately 4,000 people on the estate. A 31-hectare site was taken out of the Green Belt when the council&#x27;s new Local Plan was adopted in December 2015, to facilitate a further extension to the west and north. The Lomeshaye Business Village, a refurbished former cotton mill to the east of the estate, contains a further 151 units, principally occupied by small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in office and light industrial uses.

==Transport==

Nelson is served by Junction 13 of the M65 motorway, which runs west to Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn and Preston, and north-east to Colne. From the town centre, the A56 runs southwest to the M65 at Brierfield and north-east to Colne and beyond, while the A682 – Britain&#x27;s most dangerous road – heads north into the Yorkshire Dales.

In November 1969, a multi-storey car park with space for 350 cars was opened in Nelson. The car park was demolished in 2019 to make way for a McDonalds.

In December 2008, the town&#x27;s new bus and rail interchange was opened at a site which used the existing railway station. The new interchange facility cost £4.5 million and included enhancements such as cycle stands, taxi and car drop-off facilities, electronic information displays, a direct link to the railway station including a passenger lift and an enclosed passenger concourse with 10 bus stands.

Rail services to and from Nelson are provided by Northern. The Interchange has an hourly stopping service 7 days a week west to Blackpool South via Blackburn and Preston, and east to Colne.

The main bus operator in Nelson is Burnley Bus Company, although Tyrer Bus, Boomerang and Holmeswood operate some services. National Express operates one coach service to London Victoria Coach Station each day from the Interchange. The town has good bus links into Burnley with peak hour services on to Manchester: X43 Witch Way service (operated by Burnley Bus Company) runs from Burnley and Rawtenstall to Manchester city centre, using a fleet of specially branded double-decker buses with leather seats and WiFi. Some early morning X43 journeys to/from Manchester start and end at Nelson instead of Burnley.

==Sport and Leisure==
===Football===
Nelson F.C. were Football League members from 1921 until 1931 and played in the lower semi-professional leagues until resigning from the North West Counties League in 2010 (returning in 2011). Nelson F.C were the first English team to beat Real Madrid in Spain, in 1923. 

===Cricket===
Nelson Cricket Club was established in 1861 and was a founding member of the Lancashire League in 1892. Nelson Cricket club has a significant success record, with 21 Lancashire League championship titles to its name. During the inter-war period, when the club enjoyed the services of Learie Constantine, the West Indian cricketer; when in 1969 Constantine became the first person of African descent to be given a life peerage, he chose to be gazetted as Baron Constantine, of Maraval in Trinidad and Tobago and of Nelson in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Nelson field three senior teams in the Lancashire League and an established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Lancashire Junior League.

===Speedway racing===
Speedway racing was staged at Seedhill Stadium from 1967 to 1970. The Nelson Admirals were founder members of the British League Division Two. The team later moved en bloc to Odsal Stadium, Bradford. The track was also used for stock car racing.

===Golf===
The town also has two golf clubs. Marsdon Park Golf Club on Townhouse Road in an 18 hole municipal, par 70 parkland golf course that opened in 1968. Nelson Golf Club, founded in 1902, is private club with an 18-hole moorland golf course in Kings Causeway.

===Wrestling===

==Recreation==

The town is home to several parks the most notable of which are Victoria Park and Marsden Park. The Heritage Trust for the North West have numerous campaigns and projects in the area. One has resulted in the restoration and conservation of a whole street of Victorian workers housing, a former primary school and cotton mill, as it was feared that the industrial heritage of the town was at risk. St Mary&#x27;s Church is also another major project in the town, which is planned to open as an exhibition centre in Summer 2012.

==Media==
Nelson along with the neighbouring town of Colne are mentioned in the 1991 song It&#x27;s Grim Up North by the band KLF.

<doc id="950122" wikidata="Q422319" url="?curid=950122" title="List of presidents of Burundi">
<text>The president of Burundi is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Burundi. The president is also commander-in-chief of the National Defence Force. The office of the presidency was established when Michel Micombero declared Burundi a republic on 28 November 1966. The first constitution to specify the powers and duties of the president was the constitution of 1974, which was adopted in 1976. Written by Micombero, the constitution affirmed his position as the first president of Burundi. The powers of the president derive from the latest constitution, implemented in 2005 as a result of the 2000 Arusha Accords after the Burundian Civil War.

The president&#x27;s stated role is to represent Burundi&#x27;s national unity and ensure that the laws and functions of the state are created and executed with full compliance of the constitution. The president has the power to appoint military commanders, ambassadors, magistrates and provincial governors. The president also appoints all judges, including those of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. The president can organize government and can call for parliamentary sessions under extraordinary circumstances. In addition to promulgating legislation, the president has the power to propose and amend laws, and can veto laws passed by the parliament. A presidential term is seven years, and presidents can serve a maximum of two terms. The president is entitled to a pension after the end of their final term of office.

Nine people have served in the office since Burundi became a republic. Only one president, Pierre Buyoya, has served on two non-consecutive occasions. Sylvie Kinigi was the first and only woman who has served in the role (on an interim basis). The current president, Évariste Ndayishimiye, has been serving in the role since 18 June 2020.

<doc id="950128" wikidata="Q4983131" url="?curid=950128" title="Buckhead Village">
<text>Buckhead Village is a neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia, one of 42 neighborhoods in the larger Buckhead district and the community&#x27;s historic business section. The Village as defined by the city as the area between Piedmont Road, Peachtree Road, and Pharr Road.

==History==
In 1838, Henry Irby purchased 202 1/2 acres surrounding what is now Buckhead Village from Daniel Johnson for $650. Irby subsequently established a general store and tavern at the northwest corner of the Peachtree/Roswell/Paces Ferry intersection. The name &quot;Buckhead&quot; comes from a story that Irby killed a large buck deer and placed the head in a prominent location. Prior to this, the settlement had been called &quot;Irbyville.&quot;

The surrounding area, which is now the larger Buckhead community, remained dominated by country estates until after World War I, when many of Atlanta&#x27;s wealthy began building mansions among the area&#x27;s rolling hills. The area that is now the Buckhead district was annexed by Atlanta in 1952, following an earlier attempt by Mayor William B. Hartsfield in 1946 that was voted down by residents. In 1956, an estate known as Joyeuse was chosen as the site for a major shopping center to be known as Lenox Square, starting the development of Peachtree Road as a major commercial, financial, and high-rise residential corridor.

To reverse a downturn in the Village during the 1980s, minimum parking spot requirements for bars were lifted, which quickly led to it becoming the most dense concentration of bars and clubs in the city. These establishments included BAR, World Bar, Lulu&#x27;s Bait Shack, Mako&#x27;s, Clarence Foster&#x27;s, Tongue &amp; Groove, Chaos and John Harvard&#x27;s Brew House. By 1996, Buckhead Village nightlife was comparable to &quot;Mardi Gras, complete with nightly arrests, puking in the streets and [drunk] college girls.&quot;

In the late 1990s illegal cruising on Peachtree Road became rampant, making crime harder to spot and the shortage of police officers more apparent. Violent crime increased, culminating with two murders on Super Bowl Sunday in 2000. Baltimore Ravens football player Ray Lewis was implicated in the murders which occurred after he left the Cobalt Club at 265 East Paces Ferry Road. Lewis pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstructing justice charges and his two co-defendants were found not guilty.

Buckhead Alliance founder Robin Loudermilk claimed that there were at least ten murders during this period related to the nightlife in the Village. Beginning in 2000, residents sought to ameliorate this situation by taking measures to reduce the community&#x27;s nightlife and re-establish a more residential character. The Buckhead Coalition and councilwoman Mary Norwood were instrumental in persuading the Atlanta City Council to pass an ordinance to close bars at 2:30 a.m., rather than 4 a.m., and liquor licenses were made more difficult to obtain. Eventually, most of the Buckhead Village nightlife area was acquired for the Streets of Buckhead multi-use project and many of the former bars and clubs were torn down in 2007.

==Charlie Loudermilk Park==
In the triangle formed by Peachtree Road, and Roswell Road, is a pocket park known as Charlie Loudermilk Park, having been renamed from Triangle Park in 2009. Located within the park is &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, by sculptor Frank Fleming, depicting a man with a buck&#x27;s head telling a story to various other animals. The descriptive plaque explains:Local lore has recorded that in 1838 a hunter hung a deer&#x27;s head at about this location in front of Irby&#x27;s Tavern. The Henry Irby Family owned 803 surrounding acres and the area was designated Irbyville on maps at that time. People started identifying the area by the buck&#x27;s head and the community then changed its name to Buckhead... The storyteller is sharing this information with its circle of small animal friends.

==Community organizations==
The key organizations organizing neighborhoods businesses and residents and working for improvements are the Buckhead Community Improvement District (CID), the Buckhead Area Transportation Management Association (BATMA), the Buckhead Business Association (BBA) and Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) B. These organizations backed a new zoning ordinance that the Atlanta City Council adopted on October 4, 2010 that expanded the SPI-9 zoning area from a small area immediately around and southwest of the intersection of Peachtree and Paces Ferry, to cover a much larger commercial area west of Piedmont Ave. and north of Pharr Rd. The stated aim of the community organizations is to create in the Village a &quot;walkable, urban community enriched with public art and parks, wide sidewalks, greenspace, transportation options, and outdoor dining, all designed to have international appeal.&quot; As of May 2011, there are plans for a $4 million streetscape program aims to improve the experience for pedestrians in the Village. The program is funded by private donations, CID funding, and a grant from the Woodruff Foundation. While the Streets of Buckhead project went on hold, other developments were moving forward around Peachtree Rd. and Roswell Rd, and so the CID will first improve pedestrian amenities around that area. Completion is targeted for mid-2012.

<text>House numbering is the system of giving a unique number to each building in a street or area, with the intention of making it easier to locate a particular building. The house number is often part of a postal address. The term describes the number of any building (residential or commercial) with a mailbox, or even a vacant lot.

House numbering schemes vary by location, and in many cases even within cities. In some areas of the world, including many remote areas, houses are named but are not assigned numbers.

In many countries, the house number &quot;follows&quot; the name of the street; but in anglophone and francophone countries, the house number normally &quot;precedes&quot; the name of the street.

== History ==

A house numbering scheme was present in Pont Notre-Dame in Paris in 1512. However, the purpose of the numbering was generally to determine the distribution of property ownership in the city, rather than for the purpose of organization.

In the 18th century the first street numbering schemes were applied across Europe, to aid in administrative tasks and the provision of services such as mail delivery. The &quot;New View of London&quot; reported in 1708 that &quot;at Prescott Street, Goodman&#x27;s Fields, instead of signs, the houses are distinguished by numbers&quot;. Parts of the Paris suburbs were numbered in the 1720s; the houses in the Jewish quarter in the city of Prague in the Austrian Empire were numbered in the same decade to aid the authorities in the conscription of the Jews.

Street numbering gained momentum in the mid-18th century, especially in Prussia, where authorities were ordered to &quot;fix numbers on the houses ... in little villages on the day before the troops march in&quot;. In the 1750s and 60s, street numbering on a large scale was applied in Madrid, London, Paris, and Vienna, as well as many other cities across Europe. On 1 March 1768, King Louis XV of France decreed that all French houses outside of Paris affix house numbers, primarily for tracking troops quartered in civilian homes.

Due to the gradual development of house numbering and street addressing schemes, reform efforts occur periodically. For instance, some US cities started efforts to improve their schemes in the late 19th century.

== Australia and New Zealand ==

In Australia and New Zealand, the current standard (Australia/New Zealand joint standard AS/NZS 4819:2011 – Rural &amp; Urban Addressing) is directed at local governments that have the primary responsibility for addressing and road naming. The standard calls for lots and buildings on newly created streets to be assigned odd numbers (on the left) and even numbers (on the right) when facing in the direction of increasing numbers (the European system) reflecting already common practice. It first came into force in 2003 under AS/NZS 4819:2003 – Geographic Information – Rural &amp; Urban Addressing. An exception may occur where the road forms part of the boundary between different council areas or cities. For example, Underwood Road in Rochedale South, part of which is divided between Logan City and the City of Brisbane.

Where a block of land, such as No. 9, is divided into parts, the sequence might go 7, 9, 9A, 11, 13. Conversely, should blocks of land be combined such as 51, 53, 55, the numbers might go 49, 51–55, 57. An older form of 9A is 9½.

In New South Wales and South Australia, the vast majority of streets were numbered when the land titles were created, with odd numbers assigned to houses on the right of the street when facing the direction along which numbers increase. There is no plan to reassign these numbers.

On some long urban roads (e.g., Parramatta Road in Sydney) numbers ascend until the road crosses a council or suburb boundary, then start again at 1 or 2, where a street sign gives the name of the relevant area – these streets have repeating numbers. In semi-rural and rural areas, where houses and farms are widely spaced, a numbering system based on tens of metres or (less commonly) metres has been devised. Thus a farm from the start of the road, on the right-hand side would be numbered 230.

Walcha, in the New England district of northern New South Wales, has a unique numbering system which differs from the rest of the state. The town lies at the intersection of the Oxley Highway and Thunderbolts Way. All properties on east–west running streets have a &#x27;W&#x27; or &#x27;E&#x27; appended to the number signifying the property lies to the west (or east) of Thunderbolts Way. Similarly, in north–south running streets have an &#x27;N&#x27; or &#x27;S&#x27; appended to the house number signifying that the property lies north (or south) of the Oxley Highway.

Ballarat Central, Victoria, uses the US system of increasing house numbers by 100 after a major cross street. Streets are designated North or South depending upon their relative position to Sturt Street.

The number system will always start with No. 1 or No. 2 at the datum point of the street, with number 1 typically being on the left side of the street.

== East Asia ==
In Japan and South Korea, a city is divided into small numbered zones. The houses within each zone are then labelled in the order in which they were constructed, or clockwise around the block. This system is comparable to the system of sestieri (&quot;sixths&quot;) used in Venice. 

In Hong Kong, a former British colony, the British and European norm to number houses on one side of the street with odd numbers, and the other side with even numbers, is generally followed. Some roads or streets along the coastline may however have numbering only on one side, even if the opposite side is later reclaimed. These roads or streets include Ferry Street, Connaught Road West, and Gloucester Road.

Most mainland Chinese cities use the European system, with odd numbers on one side of the road and even numbers on the opposite side. In high-density old Shanghai, a street number may be either a &quot;hao&quot; (&quot;号&quot; hào) or &quot;nong&quot; (&quot;弄&quot; nòng/lòng), both of them being numbered successively. A &quot;hao&quot; refers a door rather than a building, for example, if a building with the address 25 Wuming Rd is followed by another building, which has three entrances opening to the street, the latter will be numbered as three different &quot;hao&quot;, from 27 to 29 Wuming Rd.

A &quot;nong&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;lane&quot;, refers to a block of buildings. So if in the above example the last building is followed by an enclosed compound, it will have the address &quot;lane 31, Wuming Rd&quot;. A &quot;nong&quot; is further subdivided in its own &quot;hao&quot;, which do not correlate with the &quot;hao&quot; of the street, so the full address of an apartment within a compound may look like &quot;Apartment 5005, no. 7, lane 31, Wuming Rd&quot;.

In Taiwan, the European system is used in cities, and is mostly same as the cases of mainland Chinese cities and Hong Kong. Longer roads are usually divided into several sections to prevent the road having too many numbers (normally more than 1000). In rural areas, village or settlement name is used in house numbering, where numbering norms are not certain. A &quot;xiang&quot; (&quot;巷&quot; xiàng, translated as &quot;lane&quot;) indicates a branch from a main road; and a &quot;nong&quot; (&quot;弄&quot; nòng/lòng, translated as &quot;alley&quot;) indicates a branch from a &quot;xiang&quot;. For many reasons such as new establishment of buildings or several apartments in a building, the &quot;zhi&quot; (&quot;之&quot; zhī, normally simply translated as a hyphen, &quot;–&quot;) is used.

== Southeast Asia ==
The most common street address formats in Vietnam are:

* A number followed by the street name, for example &quot;. This is the most basic, most common format.
* A number with an alphabetic suffix: &quot;, &quot;, etc. This format occurs when a property is numbered 123 but later subdivided into two houses with different addresses.
* If the house lies on an hẻm/ngõ (alley), the alley number is combined with the house number: for example, in &quot;, 123 is the alley&#x27;s address, and 3 is the house number on that alley.
* More complex house numbers may occur on alleys that branch from other alleys or properties on alleys are subdivided, for example &quot; or &quot;. An extreme example would be &quot;, which is located on 3rd alley off 12th alley off 14th alley off 7th alley off 182nd street.

Another scheme is based on residential areas called . A is addressed by house number, road, and , for example &quot;. Some localities still use an older address format based on neighborhood (): for example, in &quot;&quot;, 7A is the neighborhood number. This confusing format is being gradually phased out in favor of the more modern formats above.

== West Asia ==

Generally in Iran and especially in the capital Tehran odd numbers are all on one side and the even numbers opposite along streets. Infrequently, this style confuses people because this is not how it works everywhere in the city and sometimes the numbers get intertwined with each other. In the rural parts, some houses have no number at all and some have their owner&#x27;s details as the number instead. In some cases, using the number 13 is skipped replacing it with equivalents such as: 12+1 or 14−1.

== Northern and Western Europe ==

In Europe the most common house numbering scheme, in this article referred to as the &quot;European&quot; scheme, is to number each plot on one side of the road with ascending odd numbers, from 1, and those on the other with ascending even numbers, from 2 (or sometimes 0). The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase.

Where additional buildings are inserted or subdivided, these are often suffixed a, b, c, etc. (in Spain, France and Afragola until 2001, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;quater&quot;, &quot;quinquies&quot; etc.). Where buildings are later combined, one of the original numbers may be used, the numbers may be combined (&quot;13/15&quot;), or the numbers may be used as a given range (e.g. &quot;13–17&quot;; not to be construed as including the even numbers 14 and 16). Buildings with multiple entrances may have a single number for the entire building or a separate number for each entrance.

Where plots are not built upon gaps may be left in the numbering scheme or marked on maps for the plots. If buildings are added to a stretch of old street the following may be used rather than a long series of suffixes to the existing numbers: a new name for a new estate/block along the street (e.g. &quot;1–100 Waterloo Place/Platz, Sud St.&quot;.); a new road name inserted along the course of a street either with or without mention of the parent street; unused numbers &quot;above&quot; the highest house number may be used (although rarely as this introduces confusing discontinuity), or the upper remainder of the street is renumbered.

Other local numbering schemes are also in use for administrative or historic reasons, including clockwise and anti-clockwise numbering, district-based numbering, distance-based numbering, and double numbering.

=== France===
The first record of a house numbering system in Paris dates to the 15th century. On March 1, 1768, King Louis XV decreed that all houses outside of Paris were to be assigned a number to help locate the soldiers residing in civilian houses. On February 4, 1805, Napoleon I announced that in Paris for house numbering a distinction should be made between even numbers (on the right side) and odd numbers (on the left side); the direction of the streets is oriented from upstream to downstream for streets parallel to the Seine, and from the banks to the north and south for streets oblique or perpendicular to the Seine. Such a system quickly became common in large cities across France.

A ruling in 1994 obliged French communes with a population of 2,000 or more to number their houses. Sequential numbering, common in cities, mimics the system used in Paris. But many small villages used the numbering which takes a central village point — often the town hall — and works outward (a house that is 200 metres along the road from point zero will be numbered 200, its nearest neighbour, perhaps 270 metres from the centre, becomes number 270, etc.)

=== Finland ===
The Finnish numbering system incorporates solutions to the problems which arose with mass urbanization and increase in building density. Addresses always are formatted as street name followed by street address number. With new, infill building, new addresses are created by adding letters representing the new ground level access point within the old street address, and if there are more apartments than ground level access points, a number added for the apartment number within the new development. The original street numbering system followed the pattern of odd numbers on one side and even numbers on the other side of the street, with lower numbers towards the center of town and higher numbers further away from the center.

The infill numbering system avoids renumbering the entire street when developments are modified. For example, Mannerheimintie 5 (a large mansion house on a large city plot) was demolished and replaced with 4 new buildings each with 2 stairwells all accessible from Mannerheimintie. The 8 new access stairwells are labelled A B C D E F G and H (each with the letter visible above the stairwell). Each stairwell has 4 apartments on 5 floors, so the new development has 160 new addresses in all running from Mannerheimintie 5 A 1 through to Mannerheimintie 5 H 160. The opposite example is where old, narrow buildings have been combined; Iso Roobertinkatu 36, 38 and 40 were demolished in the 1920s and the new building has the address Iso Roobertinkatu 36–40.

In the rural parts of Finland, a variant of this method is used. As in towns, odd and even numbers are on opposite sides of the road, but many numbers are skipped. Instead, the house number indicates the distance in tens of metres from the start of the road. For example, &quot;Pengertie 159&quot; would be 1590 metres from the place where Pengertie starts.

=== Netherlands ===
When more buildings are constructed than numbers were originally allotted, discontinuity of numbering is avoided by giving multiple adjacent buildings the same number, with a letter suffix starting at &quot;A&quot;. The &quot;Bis&quot; suffix is used occasionally.
Each house or apartment can be uniquely identified by a combination of a postcode, a street number and a suffix.
Apartments within the same building can be distinguished various ways: by assigning each apartment their own street number, by assigning a simple prefix (generally a letter) or by assigning a complex prefix that takes into account both the floor and the apartment on the floor (e.g. B3).
In Haarlem, Netherlands, red numbers are used for upstairs apartments.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, the European scheme is most commonly used. However, in Porto and several other cities in the Portuguese Northern region, as well as in the Cascais Municipality (near Lisbon), houses are numbered in the North American style, with the number assigned being proportional to the distance in meters from the baseline of the street.

Lisbon numbering is European and furthermore &#x27;from the river, odd numbers left&#x27;. Because the Tagus borders Lisbon on the south and the east, this means that north–south streets are numbered low from the south, and east–west streets are numbered low from the east.

In many new planned neighborhoods of Portugal houses and other buildings are identified by a &quot;lote&quot; (plot) number without reference to their street. This is in law the &quot;número de polícia&quot;, which literally means &quot;police&#x27;s number&quot; – the police formerly assigned the numbers rather than the town hall. The &quot;lote&quot; is the construction plot number used in the urban plan, a consecutive number series applies to a broad neighborhood. In theory and in most cases, the use of a &quot;lote&quot; number system is provisional, being replaced by a traditional street number system some time after the neighborhood is built and inhabited. In some neighborhoods, &quot;lote&quot; numbers are kept for many years, some never being replaced by street numbers.

The relatively new planned neighborhood of Parque das Nações in Lisbon has also a different numbering scheme: each building is referred by its plot, parcel, and building (in Portuguese: &quot;lote&quot;, &quot;parcela&quot;, &quot;prédio&quot;).

=== United Kingdom ===

The European system is most widely used. The odd numbers will typically be on the left-hand side as seen in the direction of increasing numbers (most commonly with the lowest numbers at the end of the street closest to the town or village centre). Intermediate properties usually have a number suffixed A, B, C, etc., much more rarely instead being given a half number, e.g. the old police station at Camberwell Church Street. It is extremely rare for a property (built next to no. 2 after the street had been numbered) to be zero (0) or named Minusone; in 2013 researchers found these instances once in Middlesbrough and once in Newbury. In 2022, starting to type &quot;0,&quot; into the Royal Mail postcode search revealed Middlesbrough had four listed properties, whilst Birmingham, Ellesmere Port, Lincoln and London have one each. In many rural streets, significantly built alongside before 1900, houses remain named and unnumbered.

In some places, particularly when open land, a river or a large church fronts one side, all plots on one side of a street are numbered consecutively. Such a street if modern and long is more likely to be numbered using odd numbers, starting at 1. Along oldest streets, numbering is usually clockwise and consecutive: for example in Pall Mall, some new towns, and in many villages in Wales. This often also applies to culs-de-sac and standalone terraces. For instance, 10 Downing Street, the official home of the Prime Minister, is next door to 11 Downing Street. Houses which surround squares, as well as market places, are usually numbered consecutively clockwise.

In the early to mid 19th century numbering of long urban streets commonly changed from clockwise (strict consecutive) to odds facing evens, particularly when roads were extended into new suburbs. Where this took place it presents a street-long pitfall to researchers using historic street directories and other records. A very rare variation may be seen where a high street (main street) continues from a less commercial part – a road which breaks the UK conventions by not starting at 1 or 2. On one side of the main road between Stratford and Leytonstone houses up to no. 122 are &quot;Leytonstone Road&quot;. The next house is &quot;124 High Road, Leytonstone&quot;.

In some villages, a single numbering system covers the entire settlement, especially in rural areas without formal street names. In this case the house number directly precedes the village name in addresses. This often coexists with newer developments within the same village that use street names (e.g., &quot;58 Dorfield&quot; alongside &quot;3 Church Close, Dorfield&quot;), although to avoid confusion the older houses may eventually gain street names of their own while keeping their numbers (&quot;58 Axtley Road, Dorfield&quot;).

Developers may avoid the number 13 for house numbering as in Iran, because that number is considered by some to be unlucky.

Blocks of flats (apartments) are treated in two ways:
*Flats numbered individually as part of the street. A lintel will typically be embossed or metalled &quot;1–24 Acacia Avenue&quot; or &quot;Flats 1–24 Acacia Avenue&quot;.
*Flats numbered within a building. The building retains its own number (or name) on the street e.g. &quot;Flat 24, 1 Acacia Avenue&quot; or increasingly as commonly: &quot;Apartment 9D, Newhouse Court, 1 Acacia Avenue&quot;. Outside the number of flats is discreetly shown or not revealed. Where flats are lettered, this can also be indicated by appending the letter to the building number: &quot;Flat D, 1 Acacia Avenue&quot; may also be &quot;1D Acacia Avenue&quot; (generally only one of these formats will be officially used).
*In some parts of Scotland, particularly Aberdeen and Dundee, flats in tenement blocks may be numbered as follows; &quot;Flat 3/L, 1 Acacia Avenue&quot;. In this numbering system 3 refers to the floor (with G or 0 being used for the ground floor) and L or R indicating whether the flat is on the left or right from the entrance of the block.

===Marking of numbers===
In the UK street numbering and street signposts vary across local authorities. Numbering plates (or similar) are overwhelmingly at the discretion of house owners.

In the UK fanlights in front doors were introduced in the 1720s in which the house number may be engraved. Contemporary architecture and modern house building techniques see alternatively acrylic, aluminium, or glass, ceramic, brass, slate, or stone used.

==Southern Europe==
=== Italy ===

Italy mostly follows the European scheme described above but there are some exceptions, generally for historical reasons.

In Venice, houses are numbered within six named series (one per &quot;sestiere&quot; district). Similarly, small villages in rural areas may also occasionally use a single progressive series for all house numbers.

In Genoa, Savona and Florence houses are marked with black (sometimes blue in Florence) numbers; businesses are usually (but not always) given red numbers, giving up to two distinct, numerically overlapping series per street. Those of businesses are denoted in all other writing (documents, online directories, etc.) by the addition of the letter &quot;r&quot; for &quot;rosso&quot; (e.g. &quot;Via dei Servi 21r&quot;).

=== Turkey ===
In most of Turkey, currently the European house numbering scheme is applied. The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality introduced new house numbering and street signs in 2007 by two official designers.
== Central and Eastern Europe ==
In Central and Eastern Europe, with some exceptions, houses are typically numbered in the European style. Many streets, however, use the &quot;boustrophedon&quot; system.

=== Austria ===
A double numbering system has been used, similar to the system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which also were formerly parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===

In some Czech and Slovak cities and settlements, two numbering systems are used concurrently.

The basic house number is the &quot;old&quot; or &quot;conscription number&quot; (, ). The conscription number is unique within the municipal part (a village, a quarter, mostly for one cadastral area) or within a whole small municipality.

For makeshift and recreational buildings in the Czech Republic, &quot;registration number&quot; () from a separate number series is used instead of the descriptive number. Typically, this number begins with zero or with the letter &quot;E&quot;, or has different colour, or contains words like (&quot;makeshift structure&quot;) or (&quot;weekend house&quot;), etc. In Slovakia, the provision on the use of these numbers was repealed by law 517/1990 Zb., and the numbers repealed by decree 347/1997 Z. z., according to its § 8 these numbers will be replaced with conscription numbers until December 31, 1998.

In some settlements where streets have names (mostly in cities), &quot;new&quot; or &quot;orientational numbers&quot; (, ) are also used concurrently. The orientational numbers are arranged sequentially within the street or square. If the building is on a corner or has two sides, it can have two or more orientation numbers, one for each of the adjacent streets or squares. Solitary houses distant from named streets often have no orientation number. In some places, the name of a small quarter is used instead of a street name. If there is a new building between two older numbered ones, the orientation number is distinguished with an additional lower case letter (for example, the sequence could be 5, 7, 9, 9a, 9b, 9c, 11, 13). In the 1930–1950s in Brno, lower case letters were used for separate entrances of modern block houses perpendicular to the street.

Either number may be used in addresses. Sometimes, businesses will use both numbers to avoid confusion, usually putting the descriptive (or registration) number first: &quot;Hlavní 20/7&quot;. The two (or three) types of numbers are commonly distinguished by colour of the sign. Each municipality can have its own traditional or official rules and colours. In Prague and many other Bohemian cities, descriptive numbers are red, orientation numbers are blue and &quot;evidential&quot; numbers are green or yellow or red. In many Bohemian municipalities, descriptive numbers are blue, black, or are not unified. In Brno and some Moravian and Slovak cities, descriptive numbers are white-black signs, orientation numbers are red-white signs. Many cities and municipalities have different rules.

Formerly, Roman numerals signifying the city district were added to the conscription number: e.g. &quot;125/III&quot; means conscription number 125 in district number III (in Prague, this was Malá Strana). Roman numerals were used both in cities and in village municipalities with more settlements. Nowadays, the name of the settlement is preferred instead of Roman numerals.

The first conscription numbering was ordered by Maria Theresa in 1770 and implemented in 1770–1771. The series was given successively as the soldiers went through the settlement describing houses with numbers. Thereafter, every new house was allocated the next number sequentially, irrespective of its location. Most villages still use their original number series from 1770 to 1771. In cities, houses have been renumbered once or more often to be sequentialthe first wave of renumbering came in 1805–1815. In 1857, the Austrian Emperor allowed a new system of numbering by streets. This new system was introduced in the biggest cities (Prague, Brno) in the 1860s. In 1884, land registration books were introduced and they used the old (conscription) numbers as a permanent and stable identifier of buildings. The new (orientation) numbers continue to be used concurrently.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the European scheme (ascending odd/even numbers, see above) is usually used. In most cases, the numbers increase in the direction away from the town/city centre. Some places use a clockwise scheme for historical reasons, called &quot;Hufeisennummerierung&quot; (&quot;horseshoe numbering&quot;) due to the progression of the numbers. This includes Berlin, parts of Hamburg and some other towns in northern Germany.

In some older streets in northern and eastern Germany, mainly in the former Kingdom of Prussia and adjoining areas, including parts of Berlin and Hamburg, the &quot;horseshoe&quot; numbering system (counter-clockwise &quot;boustrophedon&quot;-style numbering) was used for the numbering of new streets up until the 1920s, after which the European system was introduced for new streets.

Under the horseshoe numbering scheme, starting from one end, the buildings on the right side of the street were numbered sequentially from the near end to the far end of the street. The next number was then assigned to the last building on the left, opposite side of the street, the following numbers sequentially doubling back along the left side of the street. The building with the highest number would be the first on the left side, facing building number 1 across the street. The horseshoe numbering system remains in use in older streets in many German cities, notably Berlin, although newer adjoining streets may use modern European numbering. Kurfürstendamm in Berlin is a well-known example of a street where the horseshoe numbering scheme is still in use, although the numbering today starts with 11 at Breitscheidplatz, with number 237 across the street being the highest number.

Very small villages sometimes number all buildings in the village sequentially according to their date of construction, and independent of the street they are on. However, this scheme is being phased out because it makes it hard to find a building by its address.
=== Former Soviet Union ===

In Russia and many other former USSR countries, the European style is generally used, with numbers starting from the end of the street closest to the town center. Buildings or plots at street intersections may be assigned a composite number, which includes the number along the intersecting street separated by a slash (), like in Нахимова, 14/41 (14 is the number along Nakhimova street and 41 is the number along intersecting street).

The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase; though in some cities (including Saint Petersburg) the odd numbers are on the right side. Some cities (for example, Nizhniy Novgorod) have mixed numbering: odd numbers on the right in some parts of the city and on the left in others.

Soviet era housing districts (microdistricts) often have a complicated network of access lanes thought too small to merit their own names. Buildings in these lanes are ascribed to larger streets which may be quite far from their location; a building placed along a street may sometimes be ascribed to another street, which sometimes makes finding a building by its address a challenging task.

In some cities, especially hosting large scientific or military research centers in Soviet times, the numbering might be different: houses may have numbers related to the block rather than the street, thus 12-й квартал, дом 3 (Block 12, House 3), similar to the Japanese and Korean systems. Aktau is one example of this.

When a numbered plot contains multiple buildings, they are assigned an additional component of the street address, called корпус (building), which is usually a sequentially assigned number unique within the plot (but sometimes contains letters as in 15а, 15б, 15в and so on). So, a Russian street address may look like Московское шоссе, дом 23, корпус 2 (Moscow Highway, plot 23, building 2), or улица Льва Толстого, дом 14Б (Leo Tolstoy Street, plot 14, building B).

On very long roads in suburban areas, a kilometer numbering system also may be used (like Australian rural numbering system). For example, 9-й км Воткинского шоссе (9th kilometer of Votkinsk Highway), and Шабердинский тракт, 7-й км (7th kilometer of Shaberdy Road).

== Latin America ==

In Latin America, some countries, like Mexico and Uruguay, use systems similar to those in Europe. Houses are numbered in ascending order from downtown to the border of the city. In Mexico, the cities are usually divided in &quot;Colonias&quot;, which are small or medium areas. The &quot;colonia&quot; is commonly included in the address before the postal code. Sometimes when houses merge in a street or new constructions are built after the numbering was made, the address can become ambiguous. When a number is re-used, a letter is added for the newer address. For example, if there are two 35s, one remains as &quot;35&quot;, and the second one becomes &quot;35A&quot; or &quot;35&quot;.

It is sometimes common in remote towns or non-planned areas inside the cities, that the streets do not have any name and the houses do not have numbers. In these cases, the address of the houses are usually the name of a person or family, the name of the area or town, or &quot;Dirección Conocida&quot; (&quot;known address&quot;), which means that the house of the family is known by almost all the community. This kind of addressing is only used in remote towns or small communities near highways. For people living near highways or roads, the usual address is the kilometer distance of the road in which the house is established; if there is more than one address, some references might be written or the &quot;Dirección Conocida&quot; may be added.

In Uruguay, most house numbering starts at a high number among the hundreds or the thousands. The system is similar to the French-Spanish one: when a house is divided the term &#x27;bis&#x27; is added with the difference that no single term designates the third: when a house is divided or added between another the term &#x27;bis&#x27; is repeated as many divisions have been made or houses added in between, for example &#x27;3217 bis bis&#x27; corresponds to the third house from the 3217th, and so on. When many houses are merged the lowest number is used, leaving the in-between numbers missing. Also there are cases when no number is assigned; this occurs mostly in peripheral areas inside the cities. Low house numbering occurs in small locations, and in balneary areas houses are designated by name rather than number.

In countries like Brazil and Argentina, a scheme is used also for streets in cities, where the house number is the distance measured in meters from the house to the start of the street. In Venezuela, houses, buildings, and streets have names instead of numbers.

=== Colombia ===

The urban addresses in the cities of Colombia are based on a numerical model, technically designed in a similar way to a Cartesian plane, with a grid (orthogonal) and metric layout in each block; where the central (urban) point is number 1, which represents the intersection between street 1 and street 1; Urban roads are basically classified with the names: Calle, Carrera, Diagonal, Transversal and Avenida (Avenida Calle and Avenida Carrera); It is an urban guidelines format, with characteristics: standard, understandable, functional, flexible and for general use in all urban populations in Colombia.

In most of the names of urban roads, they are located and classified in the same way and direction of orientation, from south to north and from east to west; but in few cities the concepts of streets for races, or races for streets, are reversed.

The Streets in North and Trajectory (line), Street Street, Orientation and Cross the Races Street The Streets and Located Towards The South, Street 1 (Central Zone), The complementary form in the name of South, instead, calls towards the; north no complement is made in denomination; This applies in most cities, but in some towns the opposite applies (example: …, Calle 3, Calle 2, Calle 1, Calle 1 Sur, Calle 2 Sur, Calle; 3 Sur,…).

The races run parallel from east to west and the trajectory (line) of each race is from south to north. The races that are heading east, in most cases, are complemented with the name of the east cardinal point (Example: ..., Race 3 East, Race 2 East, Race 1 East, Race 1, Race 2, Race 3) , in other cities the opposite applies (Carrera 3, Carrera 2, Carrera 1, Carrera 1 West, Carrera 2 West, Carrera 3 West).

In addition to the runs and streets, there are diagonals and transversals. 

The diagonals run linearly from east to west, like the streets, but obliquely to the sequence of the streets and interspersed between them.

The transversals run linearly from south to north, like the races, but obliquely to the sequence of the races and interspersed between them. 

The main roads are called Avenues; If it is a street it is called Avenida Calle, if it is a race it is called Avenida Carrera, with the street number (example: Avenida Carrera 68) and it is also usually called with a symbolic name (example: Avenida Rojas).

The roads are numbered consecutively, in some cases the number is complemented by the sequence of letters of the alphabet or the simple adjective bis, to indicate that it immediately follows the same number already used (example: Street 1, Street 2, Street 3, Calle 3 Bis, Calle 4, Calle 4A, Calle 4B, Calle 4B Bis, Calle 4C, ..., Calle 5, ...).

== North America ==


In the United States and Canada, streets are usually numbered with odd on one side and even on the other. The specific ordering of the numbers varies based on the policies of the local municipality. Generally, three different systems exist:

*Streets may be numbered strictly sequentially, starting with 1 at the start of the street, and continuing in order skipping no numbers until the end. In these cases, if additional addresses are needed to be assigned to new buildings or buildings contain individual apartments, fractional house numbers may be used, or letter suffixes may be appended to the house number.
*Streets may be numbered from the most recent intersection. In these cases, numbers progress sequentially from each intersection, but skip to the next set of numbers at each cross street, usually in sets of even 100s. Thus, the first block on a street may start at 1, and continue up until the next block, when they start at 100, then 200, and so on. A block or other segment of a street that has 100 numbers allotted to it under such a scheme is called a &quot;hundred block,&quot; e.g., &quot;the 1400 block&quot; if the numbers are 1400–1499.
*Habitable structures in alleys may vary in numbering, either being numbered individually to a named alley, or being numbered to the street on the side that structure is on, possibly with a fractional or letter suffix.
*Streets may be numbered based on distances, where the house number is based on some mathematical formula according to the distance from the start of the numbering system. As an example, a numbering system can provide 1000 addresses per mile, 500 on each side of the street, amounting to an address pair (odd and even) every 10.56 feet. Thus, a property numbered 1447 may be approximately from the beginning point for the numbering system.

Even within these systems, there are also two ways to define the starting point for the numbering system. Some places will start the numbering system at the start of the street itself. Other places will define a numbering system based on a defined point or line, such as a municipal or county boundary, a physical barrier separating a community&#x27;s sides such as a body of water, or a defined intersection near the center of the municipality, with numbers increasing generally as one gets further from the baseline, regardless of where streets start or stop. Some communities use a railroad through a community as the numerical starting point. Addresses in many cites using a defined point or line roughly follow Cartesian coordinates.

===History of address numbering in US===

Many cities and civic groups have made efforts to improve street name and numbering schemes, such as Boston in 1879, Chicago in 1895, and Nashville in 1940 among others. The street grid system of New York City, with its numbered streets and avenues, is attributed to the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811. In Chicago, Edward P. Brennan worked in his spare time over 8 years to create a proposal to increase the efficiencies of the street name and addressing system, which was largely approved in 1909. In Hollywood, Florida, Benjamin Israel worked for two and a half years to change three street names in the historic black district of Liberia from those that listed the names of Confederate soldiers in the American Civil War - Lee Street, Forrest Street, and Hood Street - to the names of Liberty Street, Freedom Street, and Hope Street. A local business owner had to supply the $20,000 funding to implement the change. There are places in West Virginia which did not have named streets or addresses until at least 2013. After Verizon was caught inflating prices in 2002, Verizon reached an agreement with the state to supply $15 million to create at least 450,000 new street addresses.

House numbering can be overhauled when a single addressing scheme replaces multiple local addressing schemes. An example from the 19th century is the house renumbering that occurred as part of the Georgetown street renaming in Washington, D.C. In the 20th century, this occurred in places such as the New York borough of Queens and Arlington County, Virginia.

<text>The Origins of Totalitarianism, published in 1951, was Hannah Arendt&#x27;s first major work, where she describes and analyzes Nazism and Stalinism as the major totalitarian political movements of the first half of the 20th century.

== History ==

&quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; was first published in English in 1951. A German translation was published in 1955 as (&quot;Elements and Origins of Totalitarian Rule&quot;). A second, enlarged edition was published in 1958, and contained two additional chapters, replacing her original &quot;Concluding Remarks&quot;. Chapter Thirteen was titled &quot;Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government&quot;, which she had published separately in 1953. Chapter Fourteen dealt with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, entitled &quot;Epilogue: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution&quot;. Subsequent editions omitted this chapter, which was published separately in English (&quot;Totalitarian Imperialism: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution&quot;) and German (&quot;Die ungarische Revolution und der totalitäre Imperialismus&quot;) in 1958.

== Structure and content ==

Like many of Arendt&#x27;s books, &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; is structured as three essays: &quot;Antisemitism&quot;, &quot;Imperialism&quot; and &quot;Totalitarianism&quot;. The book describes the various preconditions and subsequent rise of anti-Semitism in central, eastern, and western Europe in the early-to-mid 19th century; then examines the New Imperialism, from 1884 to the start of the First World War (1914–18); then traces the emergence of racism as an ideology, and its modern application as an “ideological weapon for imperialism”, by the Boers during the Great Trek in the early 19th century (1830s–40s). In this book, Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a &quot;novel form of government,&quot; that &quot;differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship&quot; in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries. Further, Arendt states that, owing to its peculiar ideology and the role assigned to it in its apparatus of coercion, &quot;totalitarianism has discovered a means of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within&quot; She further contends that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy. That totalitarianism in Germany was, in the end, about terror and consistency, not eradicating Jews only. A key concept arising from this book was the application of Kant&#x27;s phrase &quot;Radical Evil&quot;, which she applied to the men who created and carried out such tyranny and their depiction of their victims as &quot;Superfluous People&quot;.

===Analysis of antisemitism and imperialism===
Arendt begins the book with an analysis of the rise of antisemitism in Europe and particularly focused on the Dreyfus affair. In particular, Arendt traces the social movement of the Jewry in Europe since their emancipation by the French edict of 1792, their special role in supporting and maintaining the nation-state and their failure to assimilate into the European class society. European Jewry&#x27;s association with the nation-state meant that their destinies were to an extent tied. As Arendt observed, &quot;modern anti-semitism grew in proportion as traditional nationalism declined, and reached its climax at the exact moment when the European system of nation-states and its precarious balance of power crashed.&quot; Nazi Germany would later exploit that antisemitism and targeted the Jewry, which was construed, among other things, as a proxy for the nation-state. In so doing, Nazism sought, among other reasons, to organize the masses to bring about the disintegration of the nation-state system and to advance the totalitarian project, which was global in its orientation.

She then discusses scientific racism and its role in colonialist imperialism, which was itself characterized by unlimited territorial and economic expansion. That unlimited expansion necessarily opposed itself and was hostile to the territorially-delimited nation-state. Arendt traces the roots of modern imperialism to the accumulation of excess capital in European nation-states during the 19th century. This capital required overseas investments outside of Europe to be productive and political control had to be expanded overseas to protect the investments. She then examines &quot;continental imperialism&quot; (pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism) and the emergence of &quot;movements&quot; substituting themselves to the political parties. Those movements are hostile to the state and antiparliamentarist and gradually institutionalize anti-Semitism and other kinds of racism.

Arendt concludes that while Italian fascism was a nationalist authoritarian movement, Nazism and Stalinism were totalitarian movements that sought to eliminate all restraints upon the power of the movement. She attributes the difference, in part, to a minimum necessary population: [T]otalitarian movements depend on the sheer force of numbers to such an extent that totalitarian regimes seem impossible, even under otherwise favorable circumstances, in countries with relatively small populations... [E]ven Mussolini, who was so fond of the term &quot;totalitarian state,&quot; did not attempt to establish a full-fledged totalitarian regime and contented himself with dictatorship and one-party rule.

=== Mechanics of totalitarian movements ===
The book&#x27;s final section is devoted to describing the mechanics of totalitarian movements by focusing on Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Here, Arendt discusses the transformation of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the non-totalitarian world, and the use of terror, essential to this form of government. Totalitarian movements are fundamentally different from autocratic regimes, says Arendt, insofar as autocratic regimes seek only to gain absolute political power and to outlaw opposition, while totalitarian regimes seek to dominate every aspect of everyone&#x27;s life as a prelude to world domination. She states: ... Intellectual, spiritual, and artistic initiative is as dangerous to totalitarianism as the gangster initiative of the mob, and both are more dangerous than mere political opposition. The consistent persecution of every higher form of intellectual activity by the new mass leaders springs from more than their natural resentment against everything they cannot understand. Total domination does not allow for free initiative in any field of life, for any activity that is not entirely predictable. Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty. 

Hannah Arendt considers the Soviet and Nazi regimes alongside European colonies in Africa and Asia, as their later and gruesome transformation due to the effect of imperial boomerang. She analyzes Russian pan-Slavism as a stage in the development of racism and totalitarianism. Her analysis was continued by Alexander Etkind in the book &quot;Internal colonization: Russia&#x27;s imperial experience&quot;.

Arendt discusses the use of front organizations, fake governmental agencies, and esoteric doctrines as a means of concealing the radical nature of totalitarian aims from the non-totalitarian world. Near the end of the book, Arendt writes that loneliness is a precondition for totalitarian domination, with people who are socially isolated being more likely to be attracted to totalitarian ideology and movements.

==Reception==
&quot;Le Monde&quot; placed the book among the 100 best books of any kind of the 20th century, and the &quot;National Review&quot; ranked it No. 15 on its list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute listed it among the 50 best non-fiction books of the century. The book made a major impact on Norman Podhoretz, who compared the pleasure of reading it to that of reading a great poem or novel.

The book has also attracted criticism, among them a piece in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; in 2009 by University of Chicago Professor Bernard Wasserstein. Wasserstein cited Arendt&#x27;s systematic internalization of the various anti-Semitic and Nazi sources and books she was familiar with, which led to the use of many of these sources as authorities in the book. On the other hand, Gershom Scholem criticized &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; but still praised the &quot;Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;. In several other places, Scholem mentions that he learned from Ernst Bloch that much Jewish literature and testimony in respect of some historical periods is not available due to pogroms, leaving antisemitic sources as the only surviving references for those periods.

The historian Emmanuelle Saada disputes Arendt&#x27;s work and the general scholarly consensus that the rise of scientific racism directly correlates with the rise of colonialist imperialism. Saada contests that there is little evidence to support that ideas like those of Arthur de Gobineau, whom Arendt explicitly mentions, hold an important place in the scientific justification of European colonialism. Saada asserts that Arendt overemphasizes the role of scientific racism in forming modern totalitarianism, but in reality, Arendt should attribute blame to the &quot;bureaucratic racism&quot; she discusses elsewhere in the text.

Such scholars as Jürgen Habermas have supported Arendt in her 20th-century criticism of totalitarian readings of Marxism. That commentary on Marxism has indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx&#x27;s apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Habermas extends that critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his &quot;Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason&quot;.

Historian John Lukacs was highly critical calling it a &quot;flawed and dishonest book&quot; with &quot;unhistorical and shrilly verbose&quot; and that Arendt coverage of the Soviet Union was superficial.

<text>Helen Elliott Bandini (June 1854 – June 10, 1911) was an American writer, primarily of Californian history. Bandini was active in civic matters, the arts and a writer for newspapers and magazines. She authored two books.

==Biography==
Helen Elliott was born in Indianapolis and educated in public schools. She came to California in 1874 following her father, Dr. Thomas B. Elliott, who was an early founder and president of Indiana Colony. The name lasted for a while until which point they wanted their own post office. Up to this time, the mail was being brought up from Los Angeles by one resident&#x27;s son who was going to school there. 

Mail for the colony came to Los Angeles earmarked for &quot;Indiana Colony,&quot; but when the community applied for a post office, the Postmaster General rejected the name Indiana Colony. Thus began the search for a new name for the town which would end up being Pasadena.

In 1883, she married Arturo Bandini (1853–1913), son of Juan Bandini and Refugio Argüello. They had two children. Her husband was a scholar and authored several books, including &quot;Navidad&quot;, a description of Christmas in Old California.

Bandini was active in civic matters, the arts and a writer for newspapers and magazines. She authored two books. One book titled, &quot;History of California&quot;, was originally published in 1908. 

Although the book was written for younger readers, reviewers recommended it to readers of all ages. &quot;Pacific Short Story Club Magazine&quot;, described the book, saying, &#x27;&quot;The work mingles enough of early California romance with the fact to make it read like story, yet gives clear ideas of the founding and growth of the State.&quot;&#x27; Her other book, a fictional story, titled, &quot;Chumash Courage: A story of California Indians before 1492&quot;,&quot; was also written for a juvenile audience.

Bandini died on June 10, 1911, in Pasadena, California, in the home that her husband had built in 1903.

<text>The secretary of state of Ohio is an elected statewide official in the state of Ohio. The secretary of state is responsible for overseeing elections in the state; registering business entities (corporations, etc.) and granting them the authority to do business within the state; registering secured transactions; and granting access to public documents.

From 1803 to 1851, the Ohio secretary of state was elected by the Ohio General Assembly to a three-year term. The 1851 Ohio Constitution made the office elective, with a two-year term. In 1954, the office&#x27;s term was extended to four years. The secretary of state is elected in even-numbered, off cycle years, (no Presidential elections), after partisan primary elections.

<text>Panayiotis Vassilakis (; 29 October 1925 – 9 August 2019), also known as Takis (), was a self-taught Greek artist known for his kinetic sculptures. He exhibited his artworks in Europe and the United States. Popular in France, his works can be found in public locations in and around Paris, as well as at the Athens-based Takis Foundation Research Center for the Arts and Sciences.

==Early life==
Takis was born in 1925 in Athens. Because of the previous Greco-Turkish War, his family struggled financially. His childhood and teen years were also shadowed by war. World War II brought along the Axis Occupation of Greece which was in effect from 1941 until October 1944, and this was then followed by the Greek Civil War from 1946 to 1949. During these, Takis kept his focus on his artwork, although his family did not approve.

== Career ==
Takis&#x27; artistic career started when he was around 20 years old in a basement workshop. This is where he first became aware of the works of Picasso and Giacometti. He was intrigued by the long, exaggerated features that Giacometti would use in his sculptures. He created his first atelier with his childhood friends, and fellow artists, Minos Argyrakis and Raimondos, in Anakassa, Athens. His first sculptures were influenced by both Giacometti&#x27;s elongated sculptures and the Greek sculptures that he grew up around. The first sculptures that he created were plaster busts and combinations of plaster and wrought iron. In 1952, he sculpted &quot;Quatre Soldats (The Four Soldiers).&quot; 
In 1954, Takis moved to Paris where he learned to forge, weld, and cast metal. While there, he created small sculptures inspired by early Greek Cycladic and Egyptian art. In Paris he also met artists like Yves Klein and Jean Tinguely who were experimenting with kinetic sculptures, which began to shift his interest from the static to the kinetic.

Those two artists weren&#x27;t the only influences on Takis&#x27; work in kinetics. Because of his nearly constant travel via train station, as well as his interest in the recently invented radar, Takis became fascinated with energies and things that cannot be seen, but are integral parts of our lives. In 1957, Takis was waiting at a train station and noticed how the lights and energies of the station melded together. This influenced the creation of a series of sculptures, &quot;Signaux (Signals). Signals&quot; are sculptures that are made of long thin metal rods that vibrate and bend as wind passes through them, similar to energy caught by radar transmitters. Takis saw these &quot;Signals&quot; as capturing the energies of the wind and sky.

His first &quot;Signals&quot; were much more rigid than later creations in the same series. To show the distribution of energy, as well as provide a street show, Takis would put fireworks on the top of these sculptures. Later on, as the sculptures in the series gained more flexibility, the rods would bend and vibrate, and at times collide with each other, creating sounds that give the sense of chords and the melody of a harp. In the 21st century, the sculptures have sold for around €100,000.

In 1958, Takis started to experiment with other energies not visible to the naked eye, particularly magnets. He explored the magnetic forces and energy of the magnetic fields, which became a foundation of his future works. He also had a child with English artist Sheila Fell in 1958. A year later, he created a piece that depicts a nail tied to a nylon string which is suspended in mid-air by the attraction of a magnet. This piece is the first of his &quot;télémagnétiques&quot; sculptures. It came to be known as &quot;Télésculpture.&quot; Takis also began a relationship with American artist Liliane Lijn this year.

In 1960, Takis moved on from floating nails to a floating man. At the Iris Clert Gallery in Paris, Takis set up a series of magnets, and outfitted the South African poet, Sinclair Beiles, with a line of magnets on his belt. In the performance, Beiles read from his magnetic manifest: &quot; I am a sculpture... There are more sculptures like me. The main difference is that they cannot talk... I would like to see all nuclear bombs on Earth turned into sculptures...&quot; and he then &quot;threw&quot; himself into the air, and was briefly suspended by the magnetic field interacting between the different magnet sets.

Takis continued to do experimental work with different energies in the world. Along with his work in magnetics, he also experimented with electricity, sound and light. With these new influences, he created &quot;Telepeintures (Telepaintings), Telelumieres (Telelights), Cadrans,&quot; and &quot;Musicals.&quot; While learning about these different energies and experimenting with them, he traveled often to the major artistic and metropolitan centers of the world. One such trip was in 1961, where he traveled to America and met his future friend, Marcel Duchamp.

In 1966, Takis began to use his magnets to create art with sounds, as well as visuals. His installation &quot;Electro-Magnetic Musical&quot; is a series of white panels with guitar strings stretched across their width, and a long needle suspended in front of the strings. Each string is attached to an amplifier and an electro magnet is concealed behind each panel. The magnets cause the metal needles to sway back and forth, and at times hit a string which creates vibrations that are amplified and played through various speakers. These vibrations release sound waves that form mysterious and serene humming music. Takis likened the music to the sound of the natural forces of the cosmos.

Two years later Takis moved to Massachusetts, where he received a researcher&#x27;s scholarship at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Center of Advanced Visual Studies as a visiting researcher, and began creating the series of &quot;Sculptures électromagnétiques&quot;. He studied hydrodynamic energy here, and his invention, &quot;Sculpture hydromagnétique,&quot; is the result of his research at MIT. The liquid is suspended because of electromagnetic forces, and this energy inspired &quot;Sea Oscillation Hydrodynamics.&quot; Takis&#x27; second aspect in this work is inspired by &quot;the perpetual moving bicycle wheel of Marcel Duchamp&quot;.

In January 1969 during the exhibition &quot;The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age&quot;, at MOMA in New York City, Takis stormed into the museum and removed one of his &quot;Télésculptures&quot; which he claimed was being exhibited without his permission. The artist considered this action as a symbolic one, which would begin a better dialogue between museum directors, artists, and the public. Takis, along with other artists as well as art critics like Nicolas Calas, established the Art Workers Coalition group to defend the rights of artists. He inspired a group of people to start a chip company of the same name.

In 1974, Takis returned to Paris and started creating his Erotic sculptures.

He returned to Greece in 1986 where he established the Research Center for Art and the Sciences in Gerovouno, Attica, although its official inauguration wasn&#x27;t until 1993.

Even though he was known for his musical sculptures, they are not the only musical pieces made by Takis. Takis also provided musical curation for plays and performances, including when he collaborated with Costa Gavras for the film &quot;Section Spéciale (Special Court)&quot; in 1975, with Michael Cacoyannis for the play &quot;Electra of Sophocles&quot; in 1983, with Nam June Paik in 1979, with Joelle Léandre, with a dancer, Martha Zioga, for the performance titled &quot;Ligne Paralléle Erotique&quot; in 1986, and with Barbara Mayrothalassiti for &quot;Isis Awakening&quot; in 1990. He created scenery for these performances as well.

In an interview published in the Tate catalogue, issued for the major retrospective held in Tate Modern in 2019, just one month before his death, Takis explains his role as one of demystification. &quot;It’s only about revealing, in one way or another, the sensory vibrations or the interlacing potentials for energy that exist in the universe,&quot; he explains. &quot;I think that’s the role of an artist, whether painter, sculptor or musician. ... I don’t think this energy should be considered as something abstract.&quot;

<doc id="950161" wikidata="Q126327" url="?curid=950161" title="San Giorgio Maggiore">
<text>San Giorgio Maggiore () is one of the islands of Venice, northern Italy, lying east of the Giudecca and south of the main island group. The island, or more specifically its Palladian church, is an important landmark. It has been much painted, featuring for example in a series by Monet.

==Location==
The isle is surrounded by &quot;Canale della Grazia&quot;, &quot;Canale della Giudecca&quot;, &quot;Saint Mark Basin&quot;, &quot;Canale di San Marco&quot; and the southern lagoon. It forms part of the San Marco sestiere.
==History==

San Giorgio Maggiore was probably occupied in the Roman period; after the foundation of Venice it was called &quot;Insula Memmia&quot; after the Memmo family who owned it. By 829 it had a church consecrated to St George; thus it was designated as &quot;San Giorgio Maggiore&quot; to be distinguished from San Giorgio in Alga.

The San Giorgio Monastery was established in 982, when the Benedictine monk Giovanni Morosini asked the doge Tribuno Memmo to donate the whole island for a monastery. Morosini drained the island&#x27;s marshes next to the church to get the ground for building, and founded the Monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, and became its first abbot.

San Giorgio is now best known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by Palladio and begun in 1566.
The belltower has a ring of 9 bells in C#.

In the early 19th century, after the Republic fell, the monastery was almost suppressed and the island became a free port with a new harbour built in 1812. It became the home of Venice&#x27;s artillery.

==Today==

San Giorgio Maggiore is now the headquarters of the Cini Foundation arts centre, known for its library, and is also home to the Teatro Verde open-air theatre. In addition, it features two harbours managed by the Compagnia della Vela: Darsena Crose, facing north (see second image below) and Darsena Verde, facing south.

==In popular culture==

The island and the church were featured in a pivotal showdown in the anime and manga JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo.

<text>Little Shop is a 1991 animated fantasy comedy television series that aired on Saturday mornings on the Fox Kids TV network, about a teenage boy and his giant talking plant. Based on Roger Corman&#x27;s 1960 comedy horror film &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; as well as incorporating elements of the Off-Broadway musical of the same name, the concept is credited to Ellen Levy and Mark Edward Edens, and the series was produced by Tom Tataranowicz, with Corman as a consultant. The horror elements in previous versions of the story, in which characters are eaten by the plant, are toned down for children in this series.

Ownership of the series passed to Disney in 2001 when Disney acquired Fox Kids Worldwide, which also includes Marvel Productions.

==Synopsis==
Self-proclaimed nerd Seymour Krelborn, an adolescent boy who works in a flower shop, is friends with a talking Venus flytrap named Junior. Junior sprouts from a 200-million-year-old seed and has the ability to talk and hypnotize people. Only Seymour is aware of Junior&#x27;s abilities. The flower shop is owned by stodgy Mr. Mushnik, whose daughter Audrey is the object of Seymour&#x27;s affections. Audrey, however, is unaware of Seymour&#x27;s feelings towards her. Buck-toothed Paine Driller, a neighborhood bully, continuously targets Seymour.

Episodes focus on the pubescent exploits of the leads and frequently feature a moral. They also feature a couple of musical numbers per episode. Consistent with the &quot;urban&quot; persona of the plant in the musical, Audrey Junior raps in the series during his numbers, and speaks in a hip-hop dialect. Also featured are a trio of singing flowers reminiscent of Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon (the three chorus girls in the musical).

==Differences between the film and series==
Each episode features a musical segment. The young human characters are thirteen years old and in junior high. Junior is a kind-hearted plant, rather than a man-eating alien; and hatched from a prehistoric Earth plant that has been dormant for over 200 million years. Although Junior does maintain a voracious appetite, this iteration would very rarely (and only offscreen) feast on human blood. The plant retains its ability to hypnotize people, as was in the film, as well as the ability to telekinetically manipulate plants and objects made from plant-based materials. Junior sometimes aids Seymour without his knowledge, sometimes by using his hypnotic abilities, and will occasionally insult Seymour.

Audrey, Seymour&#x27;s love interest, is a bow-wearing brunette who is always thinking about what job she wants when she grows up. She is Mr. Mushnik&#x27;s daughter in this version. Brace-faced neighborhood bully Paine Driller replaces the character of Orin Scrivello, the dentist. (Paine&#x27;s name alludes to the dentist&#x27;s sadistic tendencies.)

<doc id="950191" wikidata="Q3123559" url="?curid=950191" title="Petroleum politics">
<text>Petroleum politics have been an increasingly important aspect of diplomacy since the rise of the petroleum industry in the Middle East in the early 20th century. As competition continues for a vital resource, the strategic calculations of major and minor countries alike place prominent emphasis on the pumping, refining, transport, sale and use of petroleum products.

==Quota agreements==
The Achnacarry Agreement or &quot;As-Is Agreement&quot; was an early attempt to restrict petroleum production, signed in Scotland on 17 September 1928. The discovery of the East Texas Oil Field in the 1930s led to a boom in production that caused prices to fall, leading the Railroad Commission of Texas to control production. The Commission retained &quot;de facto&quot; control of the market until the rise of OPEC in the 1970s.

The Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement of 1944 tried to extend these restrictions internationally but was opposed by the industry in the United States and so Franklin Roosevelt withdrew from the deal.

Venezuela was the first country to move towards the establishment of OPEC by approaching Iran, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in 1949, but OPEC was not set up until 1960, when the United States forced import quotas on Venezuelan and Persian Gulf oil in order to support the Canadian and Mexican oil industries. OPEC first wielded its power with the 1973 oil embargo against the United States and Western Europe.

==Oil and international conflict==

The term &quot;petro-aggression&quot; has been used to describe the tendency of oil-rich states to instigate international conflicts. There are many examples including: Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Iran and Kuwait; Libya&#x27;s repeated incursions into Chad in the 1970s and 1980s; Iran&#x27;s long-standing suspicion of Western powers. Some scholars have also suggested that oil-rich states are frequently the targets of &quot;resource wars.&quot;

Cullen Hendrix, author of the academic article &quot;Oil Prices and Interstate Conflict&quot;, focuses on creating a more sound measurement of an index, building off of Colgan and Weeks indices respectfully. Hendrix findings are such that as the price in oil goes up the more confrontational a petro-state becomes. This may be due to the fact that these countries can now invest more heavily in their military. When people feel secure, they tend to give a higher approval rating to the leader. A petro-state GDP will grow, offering the opportunity for a more diverse industry, which in turn gives more bargaining chips in terms of global negotiations.

Research by Emily Meierding has characterized oil wars as largely a myth. She argues that proponents of oil wars underestimate the ability to seize and exploit foreign oil fields, and thus exaggerate the value of oil wars. She has examined four cases commonly described as oil wars (Japan&#x27;s attack on the Dutch East Indies in World War II, Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, the Iran-Iraq War, and the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay), finding that control of additional oil resources was not the main cause of aggression in the conflicts.

A 2024 study found that the presence of oil in contested territory can make states less likely to seek to acquire the territory.

==Peak oil==

In 1956, a Shell geophysicist named M. King Hubbert accurately predicted that U.S. oil production would peak in 1970.

In 1970, production effectively peaked in the United States.

In June 2006, former U.S. president Bill Clinton said in a speech,

&quot;We may be at a point of peak oil production. You may see $100 a barrel oil in the next two or three years, but what still is driving this globalization is the idea that is you cannot possibly get rich, stay rich and get richer if you don’t release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That was true in the industrial era; it is simply factually not true. What is true is that the old energy economy is well organized, financed and connected politically.&quot;

In a 1999 speech, Dick Cheney, the US vice president and former CEO of Halliburton (one of the world&#x27;s largest energy services corporations), said,

&quot;By some estimates there will be an average of two per cent annual growth in global oil demand over the years ahead along with conservatively a three per cent natural decline in production from existing reserves. That means by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional fifty million barrels a day. So where is the oil going to come from?...While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East with two thirds of the world&#x27;s oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies, even though companies are anxious for greater access there, progress continues to be slow.&quot;

Cheney went on to argue that the oil industry should become more active in politics:

&quot;Oil is the only large industry whose leverage has not been all that effective in the political arena. Textiles, electronics, agriculture all seem often to be more influential. Our constituency is not only oilmen from Louisiana and Texas, but software writers in Massachusetts and specialty steel producers in Pennsylvania. I am struck that this industry is so strong technically and financially yet not as politically successful or influential as are often smaller industries. We need to earn credibility to have our views heard.&quot;

==Pipeline diplomacy in the Caspian Sea area==

The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline was built to transport crude oil and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum pipeline was built to transport natural gas from the western side (Azerbaijani sector) of the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea bypassing Russian pipelines and thus Russian control. Following the construction of the pipelines, the United States and the European Union proposed extending them by means of the proposed Trans-Caspian Oil Pipeline and the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline under the Caspian Sea to oil and gas fields on the eastern side (Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan sectors) of the Caspian Sea. In 2007, Russia signed agreements with Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to connect their oil and gas fields to the Russian pipeline system effectively killing the undersea route.

China has completed the Kazakhstan–China oil pipeline from the Kazakhstan oil fields to the Chinese Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline in China. China is also working on the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline from the Kazakhstan gas fields to the Chinese West-East Gas Pipeline in China.

==Politics of oil nationalization==

Several countries have nationalised foreign-run oil businesses, often failing to compensate investors. Enrique Mosconi, the director of the Argentine state owned oil company &quot;Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales&quot; (YPF, which was the first state owned oil company in the world, preceding the French &quot;Compagnie française des pétroles&quot; (CFP, French Company of Petroleums, today TotalEnergies), created in 1924 by the conservative Raymond Poincaré), advocated oil nationalization in the late 1920s among Latin American countries. The latter was achieved in Mexico during Lázaro Cárdenas&#x27;s rule, with the &quot;Expropiación petrolera&quot;.

Similarly Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1976.

==Politics of alternative fuels==
Vinod Khosla (a well known investor in IT firms and alternative energy) has argued that the political interests of environmental advocates, agricultural businesses, energy security advocates (such as ex-CIA director James Woolsey) and automakers, are all aligned for the increased production of ethanol. He pointed out that from 2003 to 2006, ethanol fuel in Brazil replaced 40% of its gasoline consumption while flex fuel vehicles went from 3% of car sales to 70%. Brazilian ethanol, which is produced using sugarcane, reduces greenhouse gases by 60-80% (20% for corn-produced ethanol). Khosla also said that ethanol was about 10% cheaper per given distance. There are currently ethanol subsidies in the United States but they are all blender&#x27;s credits, meaning the oil refineries receive the subsidies rather than the farmers. There are indirect subsidies due to subsidising farmers to produce corn. Vinod says after one of his presentations in Davos, a senior Saudi oil official came up to him and threatened: &quot;If biofuels start to take off, we will drop the price of oil.&quot; Since then, Vinod has come up with a new recommendation that oil should be taxed if it drops below $40.00/barrel in order to counter price manipulation.

Ex-CIA director James Woolsey and U.S. Senator Richard Lugar are also vocal proponents of ethanol.

It is argued that international climate policy and unconventional oil and gas developments may change the balance of power between petroleum exporting and importing countries with major negative implications expected for the exporting states.
From around 2015 onwards, there was increasing discussion about whether the geopolitics of oil and gas would be replaced by the geopolitics of renewable energy resources and critical materials for renewable energy technologies.

Some authors argue that compared to the geopolitics of fossil fuels, renewable energy may cause more small-scale conflicts but reduce the risk of large inter-state conflicts.

The anti-nuclear movement received some funding early on from fossil fuel companies, including petroleum interests. Even in the 21st century there are continuing efforts by fossil fuel companies to paint nuclear energy in a negative light and to position fossil gas and oil as a &quot;perfect partner for renewables&quot;.

==Key oil producing countries==

===Canada===
As development in the Alberta oil sands, deep sea drilling in the North Atlantic and the prospects of arctic oil continue to grow Canada increasingly grows as a global oil exporter. There are currently three major pipelines under proposal that would ship oil to the pacific, atlantic and gulf ports. These projects have stirred internal controversy, receiving fierce opposition from First Nations groups and environmentalists.

===Iran===

Discovery of oil in 1908 at Masjed Soleiman in Iran initiated the quest for oil in the Middle East. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) was founded in 1909. In 1951, Iran nationalized its oil fields, initiating the Abadan Crisis. The Central Intelligence Agency and MI6 responded by supporting a coup against its democratically elected prime minister, Mosaddeq, and brought the former Shah&#x27;s son to power in 1953. During the coup, Western-back Iranian rebels arrested Mosaddeq and kept him under house arrest. Iran exports oil to China and Russia.

===Iraq===
Iraq holds the world&#x27;s second-largest proven oil reserves, with increasing exploration expected to enlarge them beyond of &quot;high-grade crude, extraordinarily cheap to produce.&quot; Organizations such as the Global Policy Forum (GPF) have asserted that Iraq&#x27;s oil is &quot;the central feature of the political landscape&quot; there, and that as a result of the 2003 invasion,&quot;&#x27;friendly&#x27; companies expect to gain most of the lucrative oil deals that will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in profits in the coming decades.&quot; According to GPF, U.S. influence over the 2005 Constitution of Iraq has made sure it &quot;contains language that guarantees a major role for foreign companies.&quot;

===Mexico===

Mexico has a largely oil-based economy, being the seventh largest producer of petroleum. Though Mexico has gradually explored different types of electricity, oil is still crucial, recently generating 10% of revenue.

Before 1938, all petroleum companies in Mexico were foreign based, often from the United States or Europe. The petroleum industry was nationalized in the late 1930s to early 1940s by then-president Lázaro Cárdenas, creating PEMEX. Mexico&#x27;s oil industry still remains heavily nationalized. Though oil production has fallen in recent years, Mexico still remains in seventh place.

===Norway===

Although Norway relies heavily on natural gas and oil for export income, the country consumes almost none of the petroleum resources that they produce. In 2017, Norway was ranked 3rd behind Russia and Qatar as the world&#x27;s largest natural gas exporter. Norway was also the 8th largest exporter of crude oil in the world. These industries are a vital part of Norway&#x27;s economy, making up nearly 50% of the country&#x27;s total export value and accounts for 17% of its GDP.

Norway however, runs on 98% renewable energy with a heavy emphasis on hydroelectric power. Their development of renewable energy allows Norway to export their non-renewable energy to turn a profit. “Nearly all oil and gas produced on the Norwegian shelf is exported, and combined, oil and gas equals about half of the total value of Norwegian exports of goods. This makes oil and gas the most important export commodities in the Norwegian economy.&quot; This has positioned Norway in a very unique spot as they aspire to be the world&#x27;s leading climate change combatant while still drilling/fracking in the North Sea, Norwegian Sea, and the Barents Sea.

Several Norwegian environmental groups, such as Greenpeace Norway and Young Friends of the Earth Norway, have sued the Norwegian government for the opening of new oil and natural gas plants in the Arctic. As Norway continues to pursue a green future, the Norwegian government pursues different avenues of justifying that petroleum has a place in a low-carbon future. Norway&#x27;s government is continuing to pass measures to bolster their oil and natural gas sectors, while simultaneously passing legislation to further their environmental agenda. Continued dependence on oil production has strong support in the government: ”...the petroleum policy in Norway has been supported by the largest political parties across the left-right cleavage in Norwegian politics. Although there have been tensions on certain issues, the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the Progress Party make up the majority of support for the current petroleum policy in Parliament.”

Norway has avoided the “oil curse” or “dutch disease” Dutch disease that many oil producing countries have experienced, in part because it began to harvest petroleum resources at a time when the government regulation was well developed and already in an economically strong position: “Norway had the advantage of entering its oil era with a mature, open democracy as well as bureaucratic institutions with experience regulating other natural resource industries (hydropower generation, fishing, and mining for example)”.

As Norway began to exploit their petroleum resources, the government took steps to ensure that the natural resource industry did not deplete other industries in Norway by funneling profits from the state owned operations into a pension fund known as the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG). The GPFG is the world&#x27;s largest sovereign wealth fund and was established for the purpose of investing in the surplus revenues of the petroleum sector in Norway. “The Norwegian government receives these funds from their market shares within oil industries, such as their two-thirds share of Statoil, and allocates it through their government-controlled domestic economy.”

===Nigeria===
Petroleum in Nigeria was discovered in 1955 at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta. High oil prices were the driving force behind Nigeria’s economic growth. This has made the Nigerian economy to become the largest in Africa surpassing both Egypt and South Africa, also making it the 24th largest in the world.
The Nigerian economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector, which accounts for 98% percent of export earnings and 83% of federal government revenues as well as generating 14% of its GDP.

Even with the substantial oil wealth, Nigeria ranks as one of the poorest countries in the world, with a $1,000 per capita income and more than 70 percent of the population living in poverty. In October 2005, the 15-member Paris Club announced that it would cancel 60 percent of the debt owed by Nigeria. However, Nigeria must still pay $12.4 billion in arrears amongst meeting other conditions. In March 2006, phase two of the Paris Club agreement will include an additional 34 percent debt cancellation, while Nigeria will be responsible for paying back any remaining eligible debts to the lending nations. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which recently praised the Nigerian government for adopting tighter fiscal policies, will be allowed to monitor Nigeria without having to disburse loans to the country.

===Russia===

High-priced oil allowed the Soviet Union to subsidize the struggling economies of the Soviet bloc for a time, and the loss of petrodollar income during the 1980s oil glut contributed to the bloc&#x27;s collapse in 1989.

===Saudi Arabia===

In 1973, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations imposed an oil embargo against the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and other Western nations which supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. The embargo caused an oil crisis with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy.

Saudi Arabia is an oil-based economy with strong government controls over major economic activities. It possesses both the world&#x27;s largest known oil reserves, which are 25% of the world&#x27;s proven reserves, and produces the largest amount of the world&#x27;s oil. As of 2005, Ghawar field accounts for about half of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s total oil production capacity.

Saudi Arabia ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC, its decisions to raise or cut production almost immediately impact world oil prices. It is perhaps the best example of a contemporary energy superpower, in terms of having power and influence on the global stage (due to its energy reserves and production of not just oil, but natural gas as well). Saudi Arabia is often referred to as the world&#x27;s only &quot;oil superpower&quot;.

It has been suggested that the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict was a powerful influence in the Saudi decision to launch the price war in 2014, as was Cold War rivalry between the United States and Russia. Larry Elliott argued that &quot;with the help of its Saudi ally, Washington is trying to drive down the oil price by flooding an already weak market with crude. As the Russians and the Iranians are heavily dependent on oil exports, the assumption is that they will become easier to deal with.&quot; Vice President of Russia&#x27;s largest oil company, Rosneft, accused Saudi Arabia of conspiring against Russia.

===United States===

In 1998, about 40% of the energy consumed by the United States came from oil. The United States is responsible for 25% of the world&#x27;s oil consumption, while having only 3% of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves and less than 5% of the world&#x27;s population. In January 1980, President Jimmy Carter explicitly declared: &quot;An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States.&quot;

===Venezuela===

According to the Oil and Gas Journal (OGJ), Venezuela has of proven conventional oil reserves, the largest of any country in the Western Hemisphere. In addition it has non-conventional oil deposits similar in size to Canada&#x27;s - at approximately equal to the world&#x27;s reserves of conventional oil. About of this may be producible at current prices using current technology. Venezuela&#x27;s Orinoco tar sands are less viscous than Canada&#x27;s Athabasca oil sands – meaning they can be produced by more conventional means, but are buried deeper – meaning they cannot be extracted by surface mining. In an attempt to have these &quot;extra heavy&quot; oil reserves recognized by the international community, Venezuela has moved to add them to its conventional reserves to give nearly of total oil reserves. This would give it the largest oil reserves in the world, even ahead of Saudi Arabia.

Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1975–1976, creating Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA), the country&#x27;s state-run oil and natural gas company. Along with being Venezuela&#x27;s largest employer, PdVSA accounts for about one-third of the country&#x27;s GDP, 50 percent of the government&#x27;s revenue and 80 percent of Venezuela&#x27;s exports earnings. In recent years, under the influence of President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has reduced PdVSA&#x27;s previous autonomy and amended the rules regulating the country&#x27;s hydrocarbons sector.
In the 1990s, Venezuela opened its upstream oil sector to private investment. This collection of policies, called apertura, facilitated the creation of 32 operating service agreements (OSA) with 22 separate foreign oil companies, including international oil majors like Chevron, BP, Total, and Repsol-YPF. Hugo Chávez, the President of Venezuela sharply diverged from previous administrations&#x27; economic policies. PDVSA is now used as a cash-cow and as an employer-of-last-resort; foreign oil businesses were nationalised and the government refused to pay compensation.

Estimates of Venezuelan oil production vary. Venezuela claims its oil production is over , but oil industry analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration believe it to be much lower. In addition to other reporting irregularities, much of its production is extra-heavy oil, which may or may not be included with conventional oil in the various production estimates. The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimated Venezuela&#x27;s oil production in December 2006 was only , a 24% decline from its peak of 3.3 million in 1997.

Recently, Venezuela has pushed the creation of regional oil initiatives for the Caribbean (Petrocaribe), the Andean region (Petroandino), and South America (Petrosur), and Latin America (Petroamerica). The initiatives include assistance for oil developments, investments in refining capacity, and preferential oil pricing. The most developed of these three is the Petrocaribe initiative, with 13 nations signing a preliminary agreement in 2005. Under Petrocaribe, Venezuela will offer crude oil and petroleum products to Caribbean nations under preferential terms and prices, with Jamaica as the first nation to sign on in August 2005.

<doc id="950195" wikidata="Q26126" url="?curid=950195" title="Order of Leopold (Belgium)">
<text>The Order of Leopold (, , ) is one of the three current Belgian national honorary orders of knighthood. It is the oldest and highest order of Belgium and is named in honour of its founder, King Leopold I. It consists of a military, a maritime and a civil division. The maritime division is only awarded to personnel of the merchant navy, and the military division to military personnel. The decoration was established on 11 July 1832 and is awarded by Royal decree.

== History ==
When Belgium became independent of the Netherlands, there was an urgent need to create a national honour system that could serve as a diplomatic gift. The national congress provided this exclusive right to the sovereign, this military honour system was written in Article 76.
The first King of the Belgians, Leopold I of Belgium, used his constitutional right in a larger way than foreseen: not only military merit, but every service in honour of the Kingdom. Two years after the independence, the young King officially founded the dynastic Order of Leopold. The king approved the colour and grades both civil and military, and the official motto &quot;L&#x27;Union fait la Force/Eendracht maakt Macht&quot;. In 1832 Felix de Merode had a design approved by the Chambers for military and civil merit. This system was adapted from other European countries. More specific, the Order of Leopold is based on the French honour tradition with 5 classes. On the 11th of June 1832 the law was promulgated, and the exact colours were defined; Article 2: &quot;Le ruban sera ponceau moiré&quot;. The devise was presented in the 3rd article: &quot;L&#x27;union fait la Force&quot;.

=== Wedding gifts ===

The Belgian court often used the &quot;Grand Cordon&quot; as a valuable diplomatic gift. However, in the 2nd half of the 19th century, the court also used it as a dynastic order to bestow on family members during major family celebrations. The founder gave his French family Grand Cordons as wedding gifts. During weddings the Belgian court sent large numbers of crosses to the new family and its court. For the wedding of Rudolf and Stephanie the father of the bride sent 20 Grand Cordons to the Austrian Court. In return the Belgian court received decorations; these gifts were part of negotiations of the wedding. The order was bestowed by King Leopold II on Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern and Ernst Gunther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein as a personal marriage gift. In 1878 the King named several diplomatic dignitaries Grand Cordon in honour of his silver wedding celebration, among them Vannutelli.

In 1900 the occasion of the wedding of Prince Albert was used to send 15 Grand Cordons to the Bavarian Court. Among the recipients were Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria and his two sons, Princes Ludwig (the future Ludwig III of Bavaria) and Arnulf, Duke Louis of Bavaria and the father of the bride Karl Theodor, Duke in Bavaria.

The brother of the new Princess, Duke Ludwig Wilhelm was still a minor at the time of the wedding, and Minister de Favereau opposed this wedding gift for an adolescent. However, the young prince, aged 14, received the gift by royal decree.

=== Others ===
People who fought in the Belgian revolution became members in great numbers. In 1838 the King lost his right to create members, this was from then on the responsibility of the foreign office. In 1836 Meyerbeer was made knight of the Order, by royal Command. At the end of his reign the major political elite were members of the order.

King Leopold II bestowed the order upon notable Belgian artists, generals and clergy. His successors continued to bestow the Order; among the thousands of recipients are some famous people like Porfirio Díaz, Pope Leo XIII, Mohamed Ennaceur, Pierre-Jean De Smet, Eugène Scribe, Alfred Belpaire, Victor Horta, Joseph Geefs, Gustave Van de Woestijne, Raymond Poincaré, Constant Permeke, Henry Morton Stanley, Lu Zhengxiang, Amschel Mayer Rothschild, Emile Claus, Fernand Khnopff, Paul Saintenoy, Joseph Jongen, Eugène Ysaÿe, Alfred Bastien, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Antonio López de Santa Anna, Thomas Vinçotte, Mgr. Rafael Merry del Val, John Browning, James Blyth, 1st Baron Blyth, Brand Whitlock, Charles Lindbergh, George S. Patton, Bernard Montgomery, Dwight Eisenhower, Wesley Clark, Charles de Gaulle, Mstislav Rostropovich, Count Kiyoura Keigo, Count Jacques Rogge, Prince Fulco Ruffo di Calabria and Prince Emmanuel de Merode. At the end of World War I, the order became internationally recognised for its famous members.

In 1919 King Albert granted all Lieutenant-Generals of the Belgian Army the Grand Cordon in Brussels. The King bestowed the Major Generals with the Grand Cordon, amongst the recipients some important generals like Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude, knight Antonin de Selliers de Moranville and Baron Édouard Michel du Faing d&#x27;Aigremont. Foreign recipients include admiral Hugh Rodman and Vice Admiral William Sowden Sims One of the rare Ladies in the order was Countess Renée de Merode.

The order can be bestowed posthumously; for example, Emile Verhaeren received the Grand Cordon after his death. Recipients can be deprived of the order, as for example happened during World War I with Alfred Wotquenne.

After the Second World War, the Order of Leopold was bestowed on the several officers of foreign military forces who had helped to liberate Belgium from German occupation. Most illustrious was the grand Cordons with Palms given by the King to Sir Winston Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1945. The medal was also granted to Karel Bossart in 1962, and Josip Broz Tito in 1970.

Today membership can only be granted by decree of His Majesty King Philippe of the Belgians and is reserved to the very most important Belgian nationals and to some distinguished foreign persons who contributed in one way to the Belgian military, the Belgian civil society or the Belgian State. Annually, there are two major days when the king normally grants membership, 15 April (King Philip&#x27;s birthday) and 15 November (&quot;Day of the Belgian Dynasty&quot;).

During state visits, the Order of Leopold is the most important diplomatic gift of the state. In 2015 some protest was noted when King Philippe offered the Grand Cordon to President Erdoğan of Turkey during his state visit in Belgium. A parliamentary question was consequently submitted by Barbara Pas.

In 2022, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo presented honorary distinctions on behalf of the Belgian state at Belgium&#x27;s Consulate General in New York. The Belgians honored were scientist and President of the Children&#x27;s Tumor Foundation Annette Bakker (Officer of the Order of Leopold), businessman and former CEO of AB InBev Carlos Brito (Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown), banker Georges Ugeux (Commander of the Order of the Crown), psychiatrist Esther Perel (Knight of the Order of the Crown), and artist Marie-Paule Martin (Knight of the Order of Leopold). 

== Classes ==
The Order of Leopold is issued in five classes:
* &quot;Grand Cordon&quot; (&#x27;Grand Cordon/Grootlint&#x27;), who wears the badge on a collar (chain) or on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left side of the chest;
* &quot;Grand Officer&quot; (&#x27;Grand Officier/Grootofficier&#x27;), who wears a badge on a necklace, plus a star on the left side of the chest (created on 31 December 1838);
* &quot;Commander&quot; (&#x27;Commandeur&#x27;), who wears the badge on a necklace;
* &quot;Officer&quot; (&#x27;Officier&#x27;), who wears the badge on a ribbon with rosette on the left side of the chest;
* &quot;Knight&quot; (&#x27;Chevalier/Ridder&#x27;), who wears the badge on a ribbon on the left side of the chest.

All five classes come in three divisions (civil, military, maritime). No membership can be granted to a person before the age of 42, except in the military division.

Only the Belgian king is entitled to chair the order and to be named &quot;Grand Master&quot; (&#x27;Grand Maître/Grootmeester&#x27;).

=== Grand Cordon ===
The &quot;Grand Cordon&quot; title is reserved in general for other monarchs, heirs, foreign heads of state, generals, Cardinals, ministers of state, Prime Ministers and high diplomats. The Belgian Court has granted the Grand Cordon to all of its family members often considered a personal marriage gift of the king.

The court has sent grand cordons to other dignitaries like ambassadors, cardinals, important artists and high functionaries. As of the class of commander the decision must be approved by the Council of Ministers.

Following the tradition, it is not allowed that a Belgian minister can accept this gift from the King, during the period of public office.

== Insignia ==
The &quot;collar&quot; of the order is in gold, with nine crowns, nine face-to-face monograms &quot;LR&quot; (for &quot;Leopoldus Rex&quot; for King Leopold I), and eighteen lions.

The &quot;badge&quot; of the order is a white-enameled Maltese Cross, in silver for the Knight class and in gold for the higher classes, with a green-enameled wreath of laurel and oak leaves between the arms of the cross. The obverse central disc features a lion on a black enamel background; the reverse central disc has the face-to-face monogram &quot;LR&quot; (for King Leopold I); both discs are surrounded by a red enamel ring with the motto &quot;Unity Is Strength&quot; in French (&quot;L&#x27;union fait la force&quot;) and in Dutch (&quot;Eendracht maakt macht&quot;). The cross is topped by a crown, which might have crossed swords (military division) or anchors (maritime division) underneath it. The civil division has neither swords nor anchors.

The &quot;plaque&quot; of the order is an eight-pointed faceted silver star for the Grand Cordon class, and a silver faceted Maltese Cross with straight rays between the arms for the Grand Officer class. The central disc has a lion on a black enamel background, surrounded by a red enamel ring with the motto as on the badge. Golden crossed swords or anchors might be added behind the medallion, depending on division.

The &quot;ribbon&quot; of the order is usually plain purple. However, if the order is awarded in special circumstances, the ribbon of the Officer and Knight classes show the following variations:
* Crossed swords are added to the ribbon when awarded in wartime (if the order was awarded during the Second World War or during the Korean War, a small bar is added to the ribbon mentioning the name of the war);
* The ribbon has a vertical gold border on both sides when awarded for a special act of valour at war;
* The ribbon has a central vertical gold stripe when awarded for an exceptionally meritorious act in wartime;
* A silver star is added to the ribbon when awarded for meritorious acts of charity;
* A gold star is added to the ribbon when the recipient has been mentioned in dispatches at the national level;
* Silver or gold palms are added to the ribbon when awarded in wartime to military personnel.
Stars and borders or stripes can be awarded together, but these deviations are currently only rarely awarded. The colour of the ribbon has varied during the nineteenth century from red to purple.

The &quot;ribbon bar&quot; of the order, which is worn on the semi-formal dress uniform is:

Since 1921, insignias of the order not awarded in wartime have to be purchased by the recipient.

==Award conditions==

===Current award conditions of Belgian national orders===
National orders are awarded by royal decree at fixed dates: 8 April (Birthday of King Albert I), 15 November (King&#x27;s Feast), and in some cases on 21 July (Belgian national holiday) to reward meritorious services to the Kingdom of Belgium based on the career path and age of the recipient. A number of different regulations rule the award of national order for the various ministries. In addition, the national orders may be awarded by the king for especially meritorious deeds. The royal decrees, except for conferrals on foreigners, are published in the Belgian Official Journal (&quot;Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur Belge&quot;).
The minister responsible for Foreign Affairs, currently the Federal Public Service (SPF/FOD) Foreign Affairs, administers the national orders and has a role of advisor in cases not fitting within a regulation.

For the award of national orders for persons to which no regulation apply or has been adopted, the number of awards is limited every year by decision of the Council of Ministers (&quot;contingent&quot;).

The classes of the national orders are integrated in a &quot;combined hierarchy&quot; defined by law, whereby within one class the Order of Leopold is senior to the Order of the Crown, which is senior to the Order of Leopold II.
One cannot be awarded a National Order at a level below the highest that the recipient has already received.

Persons who are the subject of criminal proceedings will usually not be awarded a national order until they are declared not guilty.

===Award of the Order of Leopold in the Military Division===
The Order of Leopold in the Military Division (with crossed swords under the crown) is mostly awarded to military personnel on the basis of their length of service, although exceptions to that rule exist where the order is presented to military personnel for exceptional or meritorious service. (e.g. awards to officers or non-commissioned officers for devoted service to His Majesy the King).
* Grand Officer: Awarded to a Lieutenant-General after holding that rank for about 2 years, for exceptional services to the Armed Forces;
* Commander: Awarded after 35 years of meritorious service to a general officer;
* Officer: Awarded after 28 years of meritorious service to a field officer;
* Knight: Awarded after 20 years of meritorious service to a commissioned officer with minimum rank of Captain, and after 40 years of meritorious service for a non-commissioned officer.
The years of service that are counted to calculate the eligibility of the award are not necessarily equal to the (calendar) years of duty. Additional bonuses can be earned for service in the air (a heritage coming from King Albert who want to bestow extra credit upon the pilots in the first World War, who often faced great danger in a new and experimental military branch) or on the battlefield (during wartime) and years of service as a non-commissioned officer or as enlisted personnel count as half for the awards made to officers.
For awards to military personnel, there is no minimum age requirement.

===Award of the Order of Leopold in the Maritime Division===
The order in the Maritime Division (with crossed anchors under the crown) is only awarded to members of the merchant navy, as members of the Belgian Navy are awarded the order in the Military Division. The Order of Leopold is currently almost never awarded in the Maritime Division.

===Award conditions for long civilian service===
The Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Leopold may be awarded to workers in the private sector or contractual employees of the public sector after fifty-five years of professional activity.

The Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Leopold is also awarded to the members of the national and provincial committees for the promotion of labour who have reached the age of 42 after a tenure of 20 years (national committee) or 30 years (provincial committee).

==The Association of the Order of Leopold==
Founded in 1932 on the occasion of the centenary of the creation of the Order of Leopold as &quot;Société d&#x27;entraide des membres de l&#x27;Ordre de Léopold&quot; / &quot;Vereniging tot onderlinge hulp aan de leden van de Leopoldsorde&quot; (Mutual aid society for the members of the Order of Leopold), the Association of the Order of Leopold (&quot;Vereniging van de Leopoldsorde&quot; in Dutch, &quot;Société de l&#x27;Ordre de Léopold&quot; in French) is a private association, that is headquartered in Brussels.

==Equivalent orders==
Even though orders from different states are not always easy to compare, the Order of Leopold is modeled like the French honour system. The Legion of Honour, which is the highest French order, has the same classes and award conditions. German orders have often different older honour systems, often with only 3 classes or less. The Order of Leopold is roughly equivalent to the following orders from other States.
* The Danish Order of Dannebrog, the Order of the Elephant being awarded almost exclusively to Heads of State and royalty.
* The French Légion d&#x27;Honneur, which is the highest French order and has similar classes and award conditions.
* The British Order of the Bath, which is the highest British order awarded to more than a very limited number of people.
* The Jordanian Order of Al-Hussein bin Ali, the highest order of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan with the scope of rewarding benevolence and foreign Heads of State.
* The Luxembourg Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau, which is the highest Luxembourgian order and has similar classes but is only rarely awarded, and the Luxembourg Order of Adolphe of Nassau.
* The Dutch Military William Order, which is the highest Dutch order but rarely awarded, could be considered the equivalent of the Military Division of the Order of Leopold awarded for bravery. The Order of the Netherlands Lion would be equivalent of the Order of Leopold in other cases.
* The Norwegian Order of St. Olav, which is currently the highest Norwegian order and has similar classes.
* The Swedish Order of the Polar Star, which is the highest Swedish order awarded more widely than to Heads of State and has similar classes, the Royal Order of the Seraphim being only awarded to Heads of State.

<text>Six Flags White Water is a water park located northwest of Atlanta, in East Cobb, Georgia. Originally opening in 1984 as White Water Atlanta, the park became part of the Six Flags family of parks in 1999. Today, it is marketed as a second gate to Six Flags Over Georgia, and the two parks often cross-promote each other. In 2012, the park hosted 505,000 visitors, ranking it #12 on the list of the top water parks in North America.

==History==
Six Flags White Water was constructed by Silver Dollar City, a theme park company known today as Herschend Family Entertainment, as a corporate sibling to their White Water park in Branson, Missouri and their White Water (Now Hurricane Harbor Oklahoma City) waterpark in Oklahoma, and first opened in 1984. In June 1998, the park was the site of an &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak, which sickened at least ten children, including the son of then-Atlanta Braves baseball player Walt Weiss. In May 1999, the park was sold to the group of limited partners that own the nearby Six Flags Over Georgia theme park, with the park becoming &quot;Six Flags White Water,&quot; and, like its sister park, being managed by Six Flags Theme Parks. Today, the two parks operate together, despite being roughly 15 miles apart, with each offering promotions for the other.

Six Flags White Water is one of five stand-alone Six Flags water parks, and the only one of the group to not use the Hurricane Harbor name.

In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed themes from attractions. They terminated several licenses including their license with The Wiggles. &quot;Wiggles Water World&quot; was rethemed to &quot;Buccaneer Bay&quot; in time for the 2011 season.

In July 2011, Six Flags introduced the Flash Pass at &quot;Six Flags White Water&quot;, and was the first water park in the world to feature the virtual queue system for their water rides. Six Flags White Water was the testing park of the new system and with huge success, nine more Six Flags water parks will be adding the system in 2012. For the 2013 season, White Water added Typhoon Twister, a five-story bowl slide.

In August 2013, Six Flags announced the addition of Hurricane Harbor, a seven-acre water park at Six Flags Over Georgia. When asked about the addition of a new water park when Six Flags already owned one in the area, communications manager Emily Murray replied, &quot;With all the surveys that we’ve seen and the demand for a water park and the growth White Water has shown, White Water is still a large part of Six Flags and [Hurricane Harbor] will complement each other.&quot; As part of the same announcement, Six Flags plans to expand White Water&#x27;s popular &quot;Dive-In Movies&quot; program, where films are shown on a screen to guests in the Atlanta Ocean wave pool, and add a stage at the wave pool for daytime concerts and music events. The stage was completed midway through the 2014 season. Six Flags also announced the creation of their Instagram page that will share photos of guests at White Water. To be featured, guests must use geotag Six Flags White Water. For the 2016 season, White Water added a mat racing slide, Wahoo Racer.

==Park layout==

Six Flags White Water is made up of four separate sections, each with a number of attractions. When it first opened, the park consisted of what is today Wildwater Lagoon, Slippery Ridge and Pine Valley. Flash Flood Canyon was added in 1998, prior to the acquisition by Six Flags.

Wildwater Lagoon includes the park&#x27;s main entrance and its primary services, including Guest Service and First Aid. It is built around an activity pool, which includes splashdown areas for the three Body Flumes, the two Rapids raft flumes, the Mutiny Chute plunge slide and Lizard&#x27;s Tail kids&#x27; slides are also located here. The area&#x27;s newest attraction is Typhoon Twister, a large water slide that consists of a 67-foot bowl.

Pine Valley is home to the park&#x27;s wave pool, the Atlanta Ocean, and its lazy river, known as the Little Hooch, named in honor of the nearby Chattahoochee River. Children can play in the Captain Kid&#x27;s Cove Buccaneer Bay and Treehouse Island play areas, while their older siblings and parents can slide into the giant blue and yellow funnel of Tornado.

In Slippery Ridge, visitors can experience the high-speed Dragon&#x27;s Tail speed slides, or &quot;compete&quot; on the park&#x27;s new-for-2016 Wahoo Racer six-lane racing slide tower, which replaces the older 100-Meter Splash slides. Raft riders can enjoy the enclosed Black River Falls and Gulf Coast Screamer slides solo, or share the experience at the Caribbean Plunge. The Bahama Bob-Slide uses large round rafts with up to six riders at once, while the adjacent Tidal Wave body flume lands in a splash pool connected to the Little Hooch lazy river.

Flash Flood Canyon contains the park&#x27;s tallest single slide, the Dive Bomber, which shares a tower with the Run-A-Way River family raft slide.

==Slides and Attractions==
==American Adventures==
First opened in 1990, the American Adventures family entertainment center operated next door to White Water, even used the same parking lot. This facility included a number of small scale carnival rides, indoor and outdoor mini-golf, go-carts, games &amp; video arcade, play area, and restaurant. All attractions were geared towards families with small children and originally visitors had to use a series of tickets to use the park (much like the old Disney ticket system.) Eventually visitors paid a single fee to play at the park.

Unlike most parks, American Adventures did not have a gate. Visitors could enter the attraction of their choice simply by walking across the parking lot. White Water maintained a single point of entry and the two promoted each other often, to the point of having a connecting pathway between the open plan of AA and the WW park entrance.

In an attempt to build attendance, the indoor mini golf course was removed to make way for an interactive &quot;theater.&quot; Several years later (and for the same reason) the main building&#x27;s central attraction, an antique carousel, was removed in favor of a four-story foam ball play structure appropriately named &quot;the foam factory.&quot;

When Six Flags acquired White Water in 1999, American Adventures was included in the purchase, and the park was considered one of Six Flags&#x27; minor parks.

However, in June 2008, the park was leased to a new operator, Zuma Holdings, which no longer co-branded the park with Six Flags White Water. In 2010, American Adventures closed its doors for good, citing &quot;circumstances beyond our control.&quot;

After the closing of American Adventures by Zuma Holdings, Six Flags Atlanta Properties took the property back over and now uses the property for trainings, HR, storage and the employee cafeteria. One of the rides, the Scrambler was removed and taken to Six Flags Great Adventure and renamed Déjà Vu in 2012.

==Incidents==
March 2016: Two individuals broke into the park, went past three fences, and skateboarded down the Tornado water slide as a half pipe. They were arrested on felony charges of criminal damage to property, causing an estimated $20,000 in damages to the fiberglass coat covering the slide.

<text>The B-series are a family of inline four-cylinder DOHC automotive engines introduced by Honda in 1988. Sold concurrently with the D-series which were primarily SOHC engines designed for more economical applications, the B-series were a performance option featuring dual overhead cams along with the first application of Honda&#x27;s VTEC system (available in some models), high-pressure die cast aluminum block, cast-in quadruple-Siamese iron liners.

To identify a Honda B-series engine, the letter B is normally followed by two numbers to designate the displacement of the engine, another letter, and in US-spec engines, another number. The Japanese spec-engines are normally designated with a four character alphanumeric designation. The B-series, the B20B variant in particular, is not to be confused with the earlier Honda B20A engine introduced in 1985 and primarily available in the Prelude and Accord-derived vehicles from 1985 to 1991. While sharing some design elements and both being multivalve Honda four-cylinders, the B-series and B20A differ substantially in architecture, enough to be considered distinct engine families.

They were made in , , , , and variants, with and without VTEC (Variable valve Timing and Electronic lift Control). Later models have minor upgrades including modifications to the intake valves and ports and piston tops, along with individual cylinder oil injectors (B18C models). They produce between and , with some models capable of a redline over 8500 RPM.

Although it has many variations, the basic design differs very little among the B-Series. There are actually two short blocks which are used for the entire series. The distinction between them was the cylinder block deck height. The one used for B16 and B17 engines (except for B16B) has a deck height of while the short block used for B16B, B18 and B20 engines has a deck height of .

The Honda B16 has appeared in six different forms over the years. 
The Honda B-series was replaced by the K-series in Civic, Integra, Odyssey, and CR-V applications.

<text>The treasurer of the U.S. state of Ohio is responsible for collecting and safeguarding taxes and fees, as well as managing state investments. The Treasury was located in the Ohio Statehouse from 1861 to 1974, when it was moved to the Rhodes State Office Tower. The original office in the statehouse, which has been restored to its 19th-century appearance, is used for ceremonial events.

Before Ohio became a state, John Armstrong was Treasurer-General of the Northwest Territory from 1796 to 1803. He was appointed to the post by the United States Congress. Under the first constitution of Ohio, 1803 to 1851, the state legislature appointed a treasurer. Since the second constitution in 1852, the office has been elective.

The current officeholder is Republican Robert Sprague.

==List of Ohio state treasurers==
==Elections==

Ohio voters elect the treasurer for a four-year term in midterm election years, along with the governor and lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, and state auditor.

<text>Matthew Robert Wiese (born September 22, 1971) is an American retired professional wrestler and actor. He is best known for his tenure in WWE, where he performed on its SmackDown brand under the ring name Luther Reigns.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Championship Wrestling (1997–1998)===
After a friend&#x27;s recommendation, Wiese tried out for the Power Plant, World Championship Wrestling (WCW)&#x27;s professional wrestling school. Upon completing his training in the Power Plant, Wiese started his wrestling career as an enhancement talent in WCW in May 1997 using the ring name Horshu. To complement the name, his hair was shaved into a horseshoe pattern and he would try to work the word &quot;shu&quot; into his promos, which most notably spawned his catchphrase &quot;There&#x27;s no business like &#x27;shu&#x27; business, baby!&quot;. He was also among six wrestlers who &quot;auditioned&quot; for an anti-New World Order faction called Piper&#x27;s Family on the March 3, 1997, episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, spearheaded by &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper. After being tested in 30-second impromptu match with Piper, Wiese was quickly defeated via sleeper hold after attempting to use dirty tactics to defeat Piper.

===AWA Superstars of Wrestling (1999–2003)===
After his stint in WCW, Wiese made his way to Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) for more training. After his finishing up in UPW, Wiese debuted in AWA Superstars of Wrestling under his Horshu ring name. During his time there, he won the World Heavyweight Championship and held the title for a total of nine months. However, he was stripped of the title due to missing mandatory title defenses. Horshu left the promotion shortly afterwards. Wiese also worked in Japan for Pro Wrestling Zero1. After an interview with Vince McMahon, he received a developmental contract from World Wrestling Entertainment in June 2003. He soon signed on and was sent to wrestle in Ohio Valley Wrestling, WWE&#x27;s then-developmental territory, where he competed under the ring name Inspector Max Impact.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2005)===

After a few non-televised matches before Raw in 2003 and 2004, Wiese was promoted to World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s main roster in April 2004 under the name Luther Reigns, where he became the &quot;assistant&quot; to then-SmackDown! general manager Kurt Angle. Reigns later made his in-ring debut on SmackDown! against Funaki. He made his PPV debut at The Great American Bash by defeating Charlie Haas, a former member of Kurt Angle&#x27;s team, with whom Angle was feuding at the time.

In September, Reigns and Angle introduced the newly drafted Mark Jindrak as a new member of their team during their tag team match against Big Show and Eddie Guerrero. This led to a four-month feud with Big Show. Reigns and Jindrak then formed a new Team Angle with Angle as the leader. From September 2004 until mid-February 2005, Reigns and Jindrak helped Angle win most of his matches as well as dealing with his enemies. Reigns and Jindrak also began to compete for the WWE Tag Team Championship on occasion. However, the faction split in mid-February as Reigns and Jindrak went off on their own to feud with The Undertaker. On the February 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Undertaker defeated Jindrak, after which Reigns smashed a television camera over Undertaker&#x27;s head. On February 20, Reigns wrestled against The Undertaker at No Way Out. Jindrak was thrown out before the match started and although Reigns managed to hold his own, Undertaker ultimately won the match.

Following this, the team of Reigns and Jindrak began to have a falling-out. Reigns became upset at Jindrak for tapping out in a &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; handicap match against the Undertaker on the February 24 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when Reigns refused to tag in. After the match, Reigns and Jindrak briefly argued before coming to blows and had to be pulled apart by officials. The following week on the March 3 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio defeated Jindrak and Reigns to retain the Tag Team Championship. After the match, Jindrak tried to help Reigns up to his feet after he was pinned, but Reigns smacked Jindrak in response. The two argued until Jindrak knocked Reigns out with a left hook. On the March 10 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jindrak and Reigns competed in a singles match, which ended with Jindrak pinning Reigns after a left hook, effectively ending their team. Reigns later took part in a 30-man interpromotional battle royal at WrestleMania 21 as a representative of the SmackDown! brand, but was unable to win as fellow SmackDown! superstar Booker T won the match.

After this, Reigns resumed his feud with Big Show after saying that Big Show embarrassed the SmackDown! brand at WrestleMania 21 when Show lost to Akebono in a sumo match. Reigns unsuccessfully tried to tip over a Jeep to prove he was stronger than Show, who then successfully tipped the Jeep over. Big Show subsequently defeated Reigns in a singles match on the following edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

Reigns then wrestled mainly on &quot;Velocity&quot;, winning the majority of his matches until he requested his release from the company, which was fulfilled on May 11, 2005. According to Wiese, the reason he requested his release was due to creative differences with Paul Heyman, as Heyman originally planned to have him and René Duprée move to Raw to perform as a tag team. Wiese instead wished to form a stable with Christian and Tyson Tomko with Christian as the leader of the stable. However, Heyman repeatedly dismissed the idea and Wiese instead negotiated his release.

===Late career (2005–2006)===
Following his departure from WWE, Wiese attempted to become a real estate salesman, but his plans ultimately fell through. Instead, Wiese returned to wrestling under his Horshu ring name and returned to Ultimate Pro Wrestling in mid-2005 to face Tom Howard for the UPW Heavyweight Championship, but was unable to win the title. On October 13, Horshu lost to The Patriot in a match for Impact Zone Wrestling. before returning to wrestling on June 17 and defeating Sheik Hussein in an impromptu match in his debut for Scott Norton&#x27;s Wild West Championship Wrestling. He returned to WWCW on September 16, where he wrestled Aaron Aguilera to a no contest after Norton interfered. Later on in the night, Horshu teamed with Heidenreich in a losing effort to Norton and Aguilera in what turned out to be Wiese&#x27;s final match.

==Personal life==
In early 2006, Wiese began working as a bodyguard, including for the AVN pornography convention in Las Vegas. He also performed tour security for touring rock bands, including Saliva and Alter Bridge.

On April 19, 2010, it was reported that Wiese had suffered a stroke in December 2009. Wiese stated that he believed his steroid use, which began during his time at Arizona State University, and the painkiller addiction he developed from wrestling were contributing factors to the cause of the stroke.

On April 10, 2015, several media outlets reported that Wiese, along with Russ McCullough and fellow WWE alumnus Ryan Sakoda, had filed a class action lawsuit against WWE, alleging, among other things, that &quot;the WWE has known for years  ... the brutality in the ring has resulted in dementia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and a lot more&quot;. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in March 2016.

<text>The Grisha class, Soviet designation Project 1124 &quot;Al&#x27;batros&quot;, are a series of anti-submarine corvettes built by the Soviet Union between 1970 and 1990 and later by Russia and Ukraine. These ships have a limited range and are largely used only in coastal waters. They have been equipped with a variety of ASW weapons and an SA-N-4 &#x27;Gecko&#x27; surface-to-air missile launcher. All were fitted with retractable fin stabilizers.

The designation &quot;corvette&quot; for these ships was a conditional adaptation as the Soviet classification was a small anti-submarine ship () (MPK). In the Russian Navy, the Grishas are expected to be partially replaced by the &quot;Steregushchiy&quot;-class corvette.

==Variants==

* Grisha I (1124.1) – 12 ships built between 1970 and 1974 and decommissioned by 1999
* The Grisha II class (1124P) were built for the KGB border guard and marked with &quot;P&quot; for &quot;pogranichnyi&quot; meaning &quot;on the border&quot;. This class was built only in Zelenodolsk and Vladivostok. These ships had a second 57 mm gun mounting replacing the SA-N-4 missile system forward. 17 ships were built in the 1970s. Two were transferred to the Ukrainian Navy and some may remain in service with the Russian Maritime Border Guard.
* The Grisha III class (1124 2nd batch) were built in the late 1970s to early 1980s. These ships incorporated several small scale modifications, including a 30 mm gun and new electronics. Thirty four units were built. Two ships were in service with the Lithuanian Navy until 2009. 
* A single Grisha IV class (1124K) ship was built in Zelenodolsk. This ship was a test ship for the SA-N-9 missile system and later was decommissioned.
* The Grisha V class (1124 M, 1124.4) ships were built between 1985 and 1994. This incorporated further modifications with the twin 57 mm guns being replaced by a single 76 mm gun. Thirty ships were built. 
** The Grisha V class (1124MU) ships were Ukrainian ships built after the dissolution of the Soviet Union among which is that entered service in 2006 with the Ukrainian Navy.
** Currently on the RF ships are being modernized &quot;Tornado 2&quot; combat complex for antisubmarine &quot;Zapad&quot; type missiles firing.
** As of 2023, some 19 Grishas (mostly Grisha IIIs) remain active in the Russian Navy.

==Plot summary==

This volume of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; depicts several distinct plots. Unusual Trolloc attacks, the dead walking, ripples in the fabric of the world and other events seem to indicate that the Last Battle is drawing near; several characters using different evidence confidently state that &quot;Tarmon Gai&#x27;don&quot; is close at hand.

===Prologue===
*A confrontation between Galad Damodred, half-brother of Elayne Trakand and Gawyn Trakand on his father&#x27;s side and of Rand al&#x27;Thor on his mother&#x27;s side, and Eamon Valda, Lord Captain Commander of the Whitecloaks, which ends with Galad obtaining a Heron-mark sword and rank of the slain Lord Captain Commander.
*General Rodel Ituralde&#x27;s campaign in Tarabon and Arad Doman against the Seanchan.
*the High Lady Suroth of the Seanchan is informed of the death of the Seanchan Empress, implicitly by the hand of the Forsaken Semirhage.
*Aes Sedai plots in the White Tower
*Perrin Aybara&#x27;s meeting with Black Ajah Aes Sedai Galina Casban and his plan of attack on the Shaido Aiel
*the immediate aftermath of Egwene al&#x27;Vere&#x27;s capture by Aes Sedai loyal to Elaida

===Mat Cauthon===

Mat travels into Altara, and Moiraine Damodred is located in the custody of the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. 
Attempting to escape Altara, Mat meets Talmanes, who has brought a large number of Mat&#x27;s personal army (the Band of the Red Hand), which contends against a Seanchan force sent to kill Tuon, using fireworks as artillery. After a series of debates, Tuon marries Mat, giving him the Seanchan title &#x27;Prince of the Ravens&#x27; ostensibly to assure a marriage of convenience. Thereafter, Tuon returns to Ebou Dar to destroy the treacherous High Lady Suroth and assume command proper of the Seanchan.

===Rand al&#x27;Thor===

Rand arranges a meeting with the Daughter of the Nine Moons to negotiate a truce; but a large-scale battle against a horde of 100,000 Trollocs and Myrdraal ends almost disastrously, when Lews Therin (Rand&#x27;s alter-ego) seizes control of &quot;saidin&quot;. Thereafter, Rand forges a truce with Lews Therin. The meeting with Tuon comes to a grisly end upon Rand and crew discovering Semirhage, disguised, in her place. In the ensuing battle, Semirhage is captured at the cost of Rand&#x27;s own left hand and reveals that his mental disorder, which allows him to communicate with his past self, is almost universally fatal.

===Perrin Aybara===

Perrin disperses the Shaido threat and rescues his wife Faile using an alliance with Seanchan Banner-General Tylee Khirgan. To overcome the large number of Shaido Wise Ones, they lace the Shaido water supply with Forkroot herbs, which impedes channeling the One Power. Rand&#x27;s adoptive father Tam arrives with reinforcements from the Two Rivers. In the course of the battle, Perrin&#x27;s protege Aram dies while attempting to kill him. In the rescue of Faile, the Aiel Rolan is killed by Perrin, although he and other Aiel had helped Faile and her friends during captivity, unknown to Perrin. Sevanna is captured and the Shaido, defeated and disgraced, are led by Therava back to the Aiel Waste, with the Black Sister Galina Casban in tow.

===White Tower Siege===
Egwene is captive in the White Tower, but keeps in contact with the rebel Aes Sedai through Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod. Despite harsh disciplining, she spreads rumors and doubt in the White Tower about Elaida&#x27;s suitability as Amyrlin. Both the rebels and the White Tower send Aes Sedai to the Black Tower to bond Asha&#x27;man, with the rebels doing so after Rand offered to counter the number of loyalist Aes Sedai bonded to Asha&#x27;man.

===Others===
Loial is married and speaks to the Ogier of his stedding (which is the name given to areas that Ogier call home, like a village) that they must assist the human armies. Then, Loial and his mentor Elder Haman wield axes during the Trolloc attack. Lan Mandragoran rides to Shienar to fight; but Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara takes him to the coast of the Aryth Ocean at World&#x27;s End in Saldaea; from there, she goes herself to recruit Lan&#x27;s scattered countrymen.
Galad Damodred kills Eamon Valda for allegedly killing Queen Morgase of Andor and becomes the leader of the Whitecloaks, and then, in his capacity as their leader, he determines to fight alongside Rand&#x27;s followers. Elayne Trakand becomes Queen of Andor. Mazrim Taim meets with a group of Red Ajah from the White Tower and agrees to their proposition: since Sisters were taken and bonded against their will by certain Asha&#x27;man, an equivalent number of Black Tower initiates should be bonded by sisters.

<doc id="950226" wikidata="Q3347095" url="?curid=950226" title="Neosocialism">
<text>Neosocialism was a political faction that existed in France and Belgium during the 1930s and which included several revisionist tendencies in the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO).

During the 1930s, the faction gradually distanced itself from revolutionary Marxism and reformist socialism while stopping short of merging into the traditional class-collaborative movement represented by the Radical Party. Instead, they advocated a revolution from above, which they termed as a constructive revolution. In France, this brought them into conflict with the Socialist Party&#x27;s traditional policy of anti-governmentalism and the neosocialists were expelled from SFIO.

== History ==
In the wake of the Great Depression, a group of parliamentary deputies led by Henri de Man in Belgium (the leader of the Belgian Labour Party&#x27;s right-wing, and founder of the ideology of &quot;planisme&quot;, i.e. planism, referring to economic planning) and in France by Marcel Déat and Pierre Renaudel (leader of the SFIO&#x27;s right wing), René Belin of the General Confederation of Labour, the Young Turk current of the Radical-Socialist Party (Pierre Mendès-France) argued that the unprecedented scale of the global economic crisis, and the sudden success of national-populist parties across Europe, meant that time had run out for socialists to slowly pursue either of the traditional stances of the parliamentary left: gradual, progressive reformism or Marxist-inspired popular revolution. Instead, influenced by Henri de Man&#x27;s planism, they promoted a &quot;constructive revolution&quot; headed by the state, where a democratic mandate would be sought to develop technocracy and a planned economy.

This approach saw great success in the Belgian Labour Party in 1933–1934, where it was adopted as official policy with the support of the party&#x27;s right (De Man) and left (Paul-Henri Spaak) wings, though by 1935 enthusiasm had waned. Such ideas also influenced the non-conformist movement on the French right.

In 1930, Marcel Déat published &quot;Perspectives socialistes&quot; (&quot;Socialist Perspectives&quot;), a revisionist work closely influenced by Henri de Man&#x27;s planism. Along with over a hundred articles written in &quot;La vie socialiste&quot; (&quot;The Socialist Life&quot;), the review of the SFIO&#x27;s right-wing, &quot;Perspective socialistes&quot; marked the shift of Déat from classical socialism to neosocialism. Déat replaced class struggle with class collaboration and national solidarity, advocated corporatism as a model of social organisation, replaced the notion of socialism with anti-capitalism and supported a technocratic state which would plan the economy and in which parliamentarism would be replaced by political technocracy.

The neosocialist faction inside of the SFIO which included the senior party figures Marcel Déat and Pierre Renaudel was expelled at the November 1933 party congress, partly for its admiration for Italian fascism, and largely for its revisionist stances: the neosocialists advocated alliances with the middle classes and favoured making compromises with the bourgeois Radical-Socialist Party to enact the SFIO&#x27;s program one issue at a time. After having been expelled from the SFIO, Marcel Déat and his followers created the Socialist Party of France – Jean Jaurès Union (1933–1935); by the close of 1935 the emergence of the Popular Front had stolen the thunder for much of the neo-socialists&#x27; tactical and policy proposals, and the Jean Jaurès Union merged with the more traditional class-collaborative Independent Socialists and Socialist Republicans to form the small Socialist Republican Union. Within the General Confederation of Labour trade union, neosocialism was represented by René Belin&#x27;s &quot;Syndicats&quot; (then &quot;Redressements&quot;)&#x27;s faction. On the other hand, Henri de Man&#x27;s planism influenced the left-wing of the progressive-centrist Radical-Socialist Party, known as Young Turks (among them Pierre Mendès-France).

At first the neosocialists remained part of the broader left. Déat led his splinter party into the Socialist Republican Union, a merger of various revisionist socialist parties, and participated in the Popular Front coalition of 1936. But disillusionment in democracy eventually caused many neosocialists to distance themselves from the traditional left and call for more authoritarian government. After 1936 many evolved toward a form of participatory and nationalistic socialism which led them to join with the reactionary right and support the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II. For instance, René Belin and Marcel Déat became members of the Vichy government. As a result, Déat&#x27;s neosocialism was discredited in France after the war.

<text>Paisley Park Records was an American record label founded by musician Prince in 1985, which was distributed by and funded in part by Warner Bros. Records. It was started in 1985, following the success of the film and album &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. The label shares its name with Prince&#x27;s recording complex Paisley Park Studios and the song &quot;Paisley Park&quot; on his 1985 &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; album.

==History==
While Prince had great chart success in the 1980s, the success generally did not transfer to other acts. With the exception of Sheila E.&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Romance 1600&quot; (the label&#x27;s debut non-Prince release), Tevin Campbell&#x27;s single &quot;Round and Round&quot; and the Time&#x27;s 1990 release &quot;Pandemonium&quot;, the label had very few commercial successes by artists other than Prince.

In 1994, amid Prince&#x27;s feud with Warner Bros., Warner ended its distribution deal with Paisley Park, effectively closing the label. Prince fought for the rights to the master recordings of all artists recorded at the label&#x27;s studios. Prince later started NPG Records, run by Trevor Guy.

The vice-president of Operations for the label until 1991 was Alan Leeds. (Leeds won a Grammy for writing the liner notes for a James Brown album, and at one point served as Prince&#x27;s tour manager on several tours.) Following Leeds&#x27; departure, radio promotion executive Graham Armstrong took over the role until 1991, when Gilbert Davison and Jill Willis, co-managers of Prince and president and executive vice-president of Paisley Park Enterprises, negotiated a joint venture between PPE and Warner Bros. (with the help of Prince attorney Gary Stiffelman). With the joint venture came funding for additional staff to run the label and oversee its artists – including Mavis Staples, George Clinton, Ingrid Chavez and Carmen Electra. Staffers included John Dukakis and Kerry Gordy as co-presidents of the label.

The label&#x27;s offices were in a building with the address 1999 Avenue of the Stars.

<doc id="950234" wikidata="Q2343863" url="?curid=950234" title="Karyn Kupcinet">
<text>Karyn Kupcinet (born Roberta Lynn Kupcinet; March 6, 1941 – November 28, 1963) was an American stage, film, and television actress. She was the daughter of Chicago newspaper columnist and television personality Irv Kupcinet, and the sister of television director and producer Jerry Kupcinet.

Kupcinet had a brief acting career during the early 1960s. Six days after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, her body was found at her home in West Hollywood, California. With her death officially ruled an unsolved homicide, and occurring so close to the assassination, her name became one of hundreds added to the multiplicity of theories that emerged after the assassination.

Kupcinet&#x27;s father publicly dismissed the theories linking his daughter to the president&#x27;s death. In 1992, after NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; program briefly referred via a caption to her alleged connection to the assassination, Irv Kupcinet described the broadcast as &quot;an atrocious outrage&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Karyn Kupcinet&#x27;s death remains officially unsolved.

==Early life==
Karyn Kupcinet was born Roberta Lynn Kupcinet in Chicago, Illinois, to Irv Kupcinet, a sportswriter for the &quot;Chicago Daily Times&quot;, and his wife, Esther Kupcinet (née Solomon). Her younger brother, Jerry Kupcinet, was a director and producer in television. She was of Russian Jewish ancestry. She acquired the nickname &quot;Cookie&quot; during her childhood. Kupcinet made her acting debut at age 13 in the Chicago production of &quot;Anniversary Waltz&quot; and went on to attend Pine Manor College for a semester, eventually studying at the Actors Studio in New York City.

==Career==
 
Kupcinet&#x27;s interest in acting was encouraged by her mother, and she was afforded access to producers through the reputation of her father. In 1961, Jerry Lewis offered Kupcinet a role in the film &quot;The Ladies Man&quot;, where she appeared in a bit part as one of dozens of young ladies in a Hollywood boardinghouse. In 1962, she appeared in the role of Annie Sullivan in a Laguna Beach summer theater production of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. She also appeared in guest roles on television, including &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;The Wide Country&quot;, &quot;G.E. True&quot;, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, and &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. In addition to guest spots, Kupcinet had a regular role in the prime-time series &quot;Mrs. G. Goes to College&quot; (retitled &quot;The Gertrude Berg Show&quot; during its short run).

Kupcinet&#x27;s last onscreen appearance was on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in the role of Penny Ames, in an episode entitled &quot;The Case of the Capering Camera&quot;. The episode aired on CBS on January 16, 1964, nearly two months after her death.

Kupcinet worked as a model and stage actress before she arrived in Hollywood. Her mother Esther &quot;Essee&quot; Kupcinet lived vicariously through her daughter. It was she who started her on that path; she wanted to create a star.

While still in diapers, Essee began to groom Karyn for stardom. “This is the child who was supposed to live out her dream,” said Peggy Schatz, friend of the family.

She made her debut on the public stage at just five and a half months old as a model, her mother arranging for her to appear in baby clothing and accessories advertisements. In the years that followed Karyn&#x27;s modelling career continued steadily, she appeared in advertising campaigns in national newspapers, magazines and then TV commercials. Family cook John Clark said in an interview ”the girl was talked into being an actress by her mother”, before she could read her governess took her to acting lessons when Essee had other plans and read the scripts to her, Karyn would memorise it and perform little shows on cue for family and friends. At just three years of age she made her entry into theatre with appearances in several &#x27;Little Theatre&#x27; productions, designed to groom children to be future stage actors.

She made her professional acting debut in 1955 at age 13 in the Chicago production of &#x27;Anniversary Waltz&#x27; by Jerome Chodorov. understudy of rising star Carol Lynley (1942-2019), also making her debut in that play.

She attended the Francis W. Parker School in Chicago, starring in the school production of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and graduating in the class of 1958. Her year book describes her as a fan of the musical &quot;Summer Stock&quot; and a future actress who is at home on the stage. She studied at Pine Manor College, was invited to join the production of &quot;Wozzyck&quot; with the Harvard University Drama Club before heading to New York to study at the Actor&#x27;s Studio under Lee Strasberg, Herbert Bergoff, Marc Daniels and Martha Graham.

When she left for California at age 20 to try her hand at motion pictures she already had a substantial body of professional acting work under her belt, having appeared in; &#x27;Apollo of Bellac&#x27; - &#x27;The Royal Family&#x27; with Linda Darnell. &#x27;The Chalk Garden&#x27; with Penny Wood. &#x27;Jenny Kissed Me&#x27;, &#x27;Time of the Cukoo&#x27; and appeared opposite Darren McGavin in the 1956 season of &#x27;Picnic&#x27; for which she received rave reviews. She loved the stage and would prove her mettle starring in a production of &#x27;Father of the Bride&#x27;, appearing for 15 gruelling weeks in Florida opposite veteran actor Pat O&#x27;Brien.

It was reported that she originally appeared on screen as Tammy Windsor and officially as Karyn Kupcinet in the movie &#x27;The Ladies Man&#x27; (1961) starring Jerry Lewis. That is not true, Tammy Windsor was a different person all together. Before her career was tragically cut short Karyn made a great start, she appeared credited and unaccredited in 31 movies, television shows and TV commercials. She also boosted her image and supplemented her income modelling and appeared regularly on stage, stage was her forte, 1962 was a busy year; she appeared in the Laguna Beach Summer Theatre production of &#x27;The Miracle Worker&#x27;. Reprised her role as Kay in another production of &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; and also appeared that year in &#x27;Sunday in New York&#x27; back home in Chicago.
==Personal life==
By 1961, Kupcinet was living in Hollywood and getting positive reviews for her acting. She had a relationship with Skip Ward, whom she met on the series in which they both appeared.
In December 1962 she filmed a guest-star appearance on &quot;The Wide Country&quot; and had her first meeting with one of the series&#x27; stars, Andrew Prine, and began dating him. However, the relationship was problematic due to Karyn wanting to make the relationship exclusive. Prine was newly divorced and was dating other people. After Kupcinet underwent an alleged abortion in July 1963, the relationship cooled further and Prine continued dating other women. In turn, Kupcinet began spying on Prine and his new girlfriend.
One afternoon upon returning to his residence with a girlfriend, they heard noises in the attic and called the police. The authorities discovered Karyn Kupcinet in the attic, stalking Prine and his friends.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department later determined Kupcinet had delivered threatening and profane messages, consisting of words and letters she had cut out of magazines, to Prine and herself. When Prine told her by telephone about anonymous messages that had been Scotch-taped to the door of his Los Angeles house, she said she had received them as well. They met to show the messages to each other; she seemed puzzled. Soon after her death, investigators for the sheriff&#x27;s department found her fingerprints on the papers and the Scotch tape. They notified the police.

Kupcinet had longstanding issues with weight, which started after she began taking diet pills in high school. The pressure to stay thin intensified after Kupcinet arrived in Hollywood, and she soon began abusing diet pills along with other prescription drugs. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interviewer, assigned to help Kupcinet promote &quot;The Gertrude Berg Show&quot; in March 1962, noted her talking exclusively about food and her weight. Kupcinet had also been arrested for shoplifting.&quot;&quot;It&#x27;s terribly difficult to keep your head clear in a town where the largest exports are make believe, fantasy and unreal reality. ...it&#x27;s an emotional industry, buying emotions, moulding emotions, selling emotions. It&#x27;s a women, a bitch wearing cheap clothes, too much make-up, costume jewellery and rented furs. It&#x27;s a town where actors pour their life blood into it and then kill themselves because of it&quot;.” -- Karyn Kupcinet&#x27;s diary.

==Death==
On November 28, 1963, Kupcinet had dinner with future &quot;Lost in Space&quot; cast member Mark Goddard and his wife, Marcia Rogers Goddard, at their house on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills. The Goddards expected her to arrive at 6:30 pm, but she showed up in a taxicab an hour late.

The couple later reported that Kupcinet only toyed with her food during the meal and avoided eating. Marcia told Los Angeles County sheriff&#x27;s deputies that &quot;her lips seemed numb. Her voice was funny. She moved her head at odd angles.&quot; The Goddards also noticed that Kupcinet&#x27;s pupils were constricted. When Mark confronted Kupcinet about her behavior, she began to cry and put her arm around him. At one point during the meal, she told an unsubstantiated story about a baby that had been abandoned on her doorstep earlier that day. At 8:30 pm, a taxicab arrived to take Kupcinet home, and she promised to telephone the Goddards.

Kupcinet apparently went straight home after the dinner. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. Rubin and Hathaway told detectives the three of them watched television, including &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;, and drank coffee until Kupcinet fell asleep next to them on the couch. She later awoke and went to her room. Rubin and Hathaway either turned the television off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume) and made sure the door was locked behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said that the two men returned to his place and were later joined by Prine, who was also Hathaway&#x27;s neighbor. The trio watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.
The Goddards went to Kupcinet&#x27;s apartment on November 30 after she failed to telephone the couple as promised. Mark later stated that he had a &quot;funny feeling&quot; that something was wrong. Upon entering the apartment, the couple found Kupcinet&#x27;s nude body lying on the couch. Mark initially assumed that she had died from a drug overdose; upon searching the apartment, investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department found prescriptions for Desoxyn, Miltown, Amvicel, and other medications. They also found a note written by Kupcinet that reflected in some detail her emotions regarding issues in her life and people she admired.

Coroner Harold Kade concluded that due to the fracture of the hyoid bone in Kupcinet’s throat, she had been strangled. Her death was officially ruled a homicide.

Investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department determined that the story Kupcinet had told the Goddards about an abandoned baby on her doorstep, which she had also told Prine by telephone, was false. Neither the sheriff&#x27;s office nor the Los Angeles Police Department had received a report of a baby found abandoned anywhere in Kupcinet&#x27;s apartment building on the day before or after the murder.

The Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Office told FBI director J. Edgar Hoover that they felt Karyn had been taking a shower immediately preceding her death and had likely answered a fateful knock at the door, given the late hour and fact she opened the door indicated that she knew and trusted that person.

===Theories===
==== Irv Kupcinet opinion on Karyn&#x27;s death ====
When questioned by law enforcement, Andrew Prine reported talking with Kupcinet by phone during the day on Wednesday. Others in the Hollywood community were questioned as well as both Rubin and Hathaway, the two men who had possibly been the last to see her alive, who were friends of Prine&#x27;s. They were also eventually named as suspects.

In 1988, Kupcinet&#x27;s father published a memoir in which he revealed that he and his wife Essee believed that Prine had nothing to do with their daughter&#x27;s murder. He was suspicious of a person, still alive when he wrote his memoir, who had no connection to Prine.

Although public suspicion fell on Andrew Prine there was a more compelling suspect to Karyn&#x27;s parents, that evidence pointed to another, actor/producer David Lange (1936-2006). “Essee and I thought it pointed directly at David Lange, who had been a friend of Cookie&#x27;s. But he was best known in Hollywood as a heavy drinker, a hanger on, and a go-fer. One day he told Cookie he was looking for an apartment and asked her if she knew of any availabilities. She inquired in her building and learned an apartment was vacant. It was on the first floor and he moved in. Cookie lived on the second floor. This juxtaposition became important on the night her body was discovered … Lange&#x27;s behaviour that night made him suspect. He was in the bedroom of his apartment with a girl friend, who later told police that they &#x27;heard some sought of commotion outside the apartment and it sounded like a lot of people were running up and down stairs&#x27;. Lange, she said, ignored the excitement and did not leave the bedroom to see what was happening. She also added that a short time later someone knocked on the door. He answered it, she said, &#x27;and came right back to the bedroom and made no comment.&#x27; Police suspect the unidentified caller had informed him of Karyn&#x27;s death, but he chose not to appear on the scene because he already knew what had happened. That enabled him to stay clear of the authorities.

“If that behaviour was suspect, there also was a &#x27;confession.&#x27;” Irv Kupcinet continued, “The police report includes a statement from a friend of Lange who reported that he told her that he was the person who killed Karyn. Essee and I pressed the sheriff&#x27;s police to pursue such a revealing statement, but their response was that they had tried with no success because Lange by this time had moved into the house of his sister, Hope, and she had retained attorneys who refused to let him answer any questions... The police subjected Lange to a polygraph test, which proved inconclusive. But no follow-up was done.” [28]

====Alleged connection to JFK====
Kupcinet&#x27;s death was first mentioned in connection with the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1967 by researcher Penn Jones Jr. in the self-published book &quot;Forgive My Grief II&quot;. Jones cited an Associated Press wire service story about an unidentified woman who placed a phone call from the vicinity of Oxnard, California, about fifty miles northwest of Los Angeles, twenty minutes before the assassination occurred in Dallas, Texas, claiming this woman was Kupcinet.

Jones alleged that &quot;Karyn Kupcinet&quot; had attempted to warn someone of the impending assassination after being given this information by her father Irv, who himself had allegedly been given advance notice by Jack Ruby, the Dallas nightclub owner who fatally shot Kennedy&#x27;s accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Jones speculated that Irv may have met Ruby in Chicago in the 1940s. Jones speculated Karyn had been murdered by representatives of the Italian-American Mafia as a message to her father to remain silent about why Kennedy and Oswald had been shot.
Irv Kupcinet denied that he or his daughter had prior knowledge of the assassination or of Oswald&#x27;s death. This was supported by Kupcinet&#x27;s friends, including Prine, actor Earl Holliman, and Holliman&#x27;s then-girlfriend, all of whom traveled to Palm Springs with Karyn on November 22. Kupcinet reportedly seemed upset about media coverage of the shootings while in Palm Springs. She did not reveal any foreknowledge of the events.

In 2013, the &quot;Ventura County Star&quot; commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination with a long article about the unknown woman who had formed the basis of Penn Jones&#x27; conspiracy theory. Citing FBI documents that were declassified decades after the assassination, the &quot;Star&quot; claimed that two telephone operators with General Telephone Company who listened to the unknown woman gave the FBI a description of her voice. FBI agents questioned the two operators several hours after the assassination. Their description of the woman&#x27;s voice did not match Kupcinet&#x27;s, especially in regard to her age. The &quot;Star&quot; added that the two operators believed the woman on the phone was &quot;mentally disturbed&quot;.

Regarding Irv Kupcinet&#x27;s alleged connection to Jack Ruby, the Warren Commission did not find any proof that Irv had interacted with Ruby in Chicago before 1947, when Ruby moved from Chicago to Dallas. The Commission questioned many Chicagoans who had interacted with Ruby. None of them had prior knowledge that he was going to shoot Oswald.

Karyn&#x27;s death occurred six days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as rumours and theories were swirling around possible Mafia involvement, that the Chicago syndicate and Sam Giancana (1908-1975) were part of it due to the Kennedy administration&#x27;s tough stance on organised crime. Irv Kupcinet had been friends with Sam Giancana, Tony Accardo (1906-1992) and other Mafia dons for decades; as such, it isn&#x27;t surprising that conspiracy theories surfaced linking the two events. It didn&#x27;t help matters that Kupcinet turned up at the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Office with old friend, Mafia lawyer and &quot;fixer&quot; Sidney Korshak (1907-1996) representing him, also handling the release of his daughter&#x27;s remains for burial. It undoubtedly raised law enforcement eyebrows as it did conspiracy theorists; Korshak&#x27;s other clients included Al Capone - Sam Giancana - Moe Dalitz (Los Vegas syndicate head) and Jimmy Hoffa. It created a frenzy of speculation around Karyn&#x27;s death and drew them into silly conspiracy theories to kill JFK which Irv Kupcinet hated, not least due to his longstanding friendship with the Kennedy family.

===Media attention===
In the early 1990s, during the production and subsequent release of Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot;, Irv Kupcinet attacked the movie and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. When the film&#x27;s box-office success led to a wave of media attention about Kennedy conspiracy theories, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; program broadcast a list of mysterious deaths, including that of Karyn Kupcinet. Irv responded to the &quot;Today&quot; broadcast in his column in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; of February 9, 1992:

 The NBC &quot;Today Show&quot; on Friday [February 7] carried a list of people who died violently in 1963 shortly after the death of President John F. Kennedy and may have had some link to the assassination. The first name on the list was Karyn Kupcinet, my daughter. That is an atrocious outrage. She did die violently in a Hollywood murder case still unsolved. That same list was published in a book years ago with no justification or verification.

The book left the impression that some on the list may have been killed to silence them because of knowledge of the assassination. Nothing could be further from the truth in my daughter&#x27;s case. The list apparently has developed a life of its own and for &quot;Today&quot; to repeat the calumny is reprehensible. Karyn no longer can suffer pain by such an inexcusable mention, but her parents and her brother Jerry can.

On September 30, 1999, an episode of &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;, titled &quot;Death of a Dream: Karyn Kupcinet&quot;, detailed Kupcinet&#x27;s life and theories regarding her death.

==Legacy==
Irv and Essee Kupcinet established a playhouse at Shimer College in honor of their daughter. In 1971, Irv Kupcinet and his wife also founded the Karyn Kupcinet International School for Science, a summer research internships program at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

In 2007, Kupcinet&#x27;s niece, actress Kari Kupcinet-Kriser, and Washburn University professor Paul Fecteau, began work on a book about Kupcinet&#x27;s unsolved murder and diaries. However the project came to nothing and was abandoned.

<doc id="950235" wikidata="Q913844" url="?curid=950235" title="The Bridge (Billy Joel album)">
<text>The Bridge is the tenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on July 25, 1986. It was Joel&#x27;s last studio album produced by Phil Ramone as well as the last to feature Joel&#x27;s long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer and rhythm guitarist Russell Javors. The album yielded several successful singles, including &quot;A Matter of Trust&quot; (peaking at No. 10), &quot;Modern Woman&quot; (which also appeared on the &quot;Ruthless People&quot; soundtrack, peaking at No. 10), and &quot;This Is the Time&quot; (peaking at No. 18).

==Background==
Joel began work on the album—on which two of his major influences (Ray Charles and Steve Winwood) made guest appearances—in 1985. Charles sang a duet with Joel on the song &quot;Baby Grand&quot;, and Winwood played Hammond organ on the song &quot;Getting Closer&quot;; Charles and Winwood later covered &quot;Baby Grand&quot; and &quot;Getting Closer&quot; respectively in concert. Other notable musicians who made guest appearances on the album include jazz musicians Ron Carter and Michael Brecker, who both played on the jazzy track &quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot;.

The album also had some new wave influences. For instance, the first song, &quot;Running on Ice&quot;, is heavily influenced by the music of the Police. Another song particularly influenced by the music of another band, &quot;Modern Woman&quot; borrows heavily from the styles of Huey Lewis and the News. The final song recorded for the album, &quot;Code of Silence&quot;, featured Cyndi Lauper who contributed backing vocals and received co-writing credit for the lyrics; she later covered that song herself in concert. Joel would return the favor by contributing backing vocals on Lauper&#x27;s song &quot;Maybe He&#x27;ll Know&quot; for her 1986 album &quot;True Colors&quot;.

&quot;The Bridge&quot; was Joel&#x27;s last album to carry the &quot;Family Productions&quot; logo which had appeared on all of Joel&#x27;s albums up to that time as part of a deal that Columbia Records made to get Joel out of his first recording contract with Artie Ripp&#x27;s Family Productions. In the closing song of the album—&quot;Getting Closer&quot;—Joel makes several of what are clearly attacks and observations on the iron-clad contract with Ripp, with references to &quot;my stolen youth&quot;, &quot;all the conmen and their acrobats who stomped me in the ground&quot;, and &quot;I must live up to contracts&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), Robert Christgau said: &quot;Maybe [Joel&#x27;s] youthful lyricism, meaning his knack for the tearjerker, is abandoning him. … Here he&#x27;s best when he&#x27;s brassy and literal: failed wise guy in &#x27;Big Man on Mulberry Street,&#x27; Ray Charles&#x27;s coequal on &#x27;Baby Grand.&#x27; And even at his most rockin&#x27; he&#x27;s seventy-five years retro whether he likes it or not—whenever he doesn&#x27;t hit it just right you want to quarantine him for life in Atlantic City.&quot;

In a retrospective interview, Joel said: &quot;Not a happy album. I wasn&#x27;t simpatico with the musicians, some of whom I&#x27;d been working with a long time. I don&#x27;t think the material was good; I was pressured by management to put it out too fast. By the end, I sort of gave up caring, which for me was unusual. I remember reading bad reviews and agreeing with them.&quot;

Billy later admitted to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that at the time of the album&#x27;s writing and recording, he was in no mood to be in the studio, saying &quot;Christie and I had just had Alexa, and I&#x27;d have much rather have been home with the baby...&quot; This angst over leaving his wife and daughter at home was poured into the album track &quot;Temptation&quot;.

<text>A wave pool is a swimming pool in which there are artificially generated, large waves, similar to those of the ocean. Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks, both indoors and outdoors, as well as some leisure centres.

==History==
The origins of wave pools go as far back as the 19th century, as famous fantasy castle builder Ludwig II of Bavaria electrified a lake to create breaking waves.

In 1905, the &quot;Undosa&quot; swimming platform was built on Lake Starnberg in Germany, which used large pontoons to force the lake water to make waves. It has since been converted into a restaurant.

In 1912, the &quot;Bilzbad&quot; in Radebeul, Germany was the first public wave pool built on the ground. It used a wave machine, also called &quot;Undosa,&quot; first exhibited the previous year at the International Hygiene Exhibition in Dresden. It still operates.

Another early public wave pool was designed and built in 1927 in Budapest, Hungary in the known Gellért Baths, and appeared in one of James A. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s documentary &quot;Traveltalks&quot; films about the city in 1938, as one of the main tourist attractions. It remains open.

The natatorium at Bayocean, Oregon also had an early wave-generating machine, before it was destroyed by natural ocean waves in 1932.

A 1929 Pathe Pictorial film featured &quot;Indoor Surfers&quot; frolicking in small, artificially-generated waves in a swimming pool in Munich, Germany. The waves were created by agitators which pushed waves through the diving area and into a shallow area - where kids were bodysurfing little waves: &quot;This is the new kind of swimming bath that is becoming the rage of Germany,&quot; one of the captions reads. &quot;No more placid waters for bathers - the mechanism behind the netting keeps everything moving.&quot;

In 1939, a public swimming pool in Wembley, London, was equipped with machines that created wavelets to approximate the soothing ebb and flowing motion of the ocean. In the 1940s, Palisades Amusement Park, located on the Hudson River Palisades across from New York City, installed a large waterfall at one end of its salt water pool, the largest of such in the world at the time, which generated small waves much like those in Wembley.

In 1966, Akiruno, Japan&#x27;s &quot;Summerland Wavepool&quot;, nicknamed the &quot;Surf-a-Torium&quot;, was the first wave pool accessible to surfers (though only for 15 minutes every hour).
Several locations claim to have developed the first wave pool in the United States, including Big Surf in Tempe, Arizona and Point Mallard Park in Decatur, Alabama, which both opened in 1969 (Point Mallard Park opened in 1970 so their claim would have to be inaccurate as is the information previous to this about them.) The first outdoor wave pool in the United States was opened on Memorial Day 1961 (May 29) at Oceana Park in Newbury, Ohio. One of three owners of Oceana Park, Miklos Matrai, holds US Patent 3005207, filed on January 13, 1959, and patented on October 24, 1961, which describes a specially constructed swimming pool having means for producing simulated ocean waves. An aerial photo of Oceana Park in 1966 can be viewed here.

The first indoor wave pool in the United States opened in 1982 at the Bolingbrook Aquatic Center in Bolingbrook, Illinois.
Opened in 1989, Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon is one of the world&#x27;s largest outdoor wave pools and the strength of the waves makes it possible to bodysurf.

== Operation ==
Wave pools replicate the movement of the ocean in different ways, depending on the size of the pool and the size of wave desired. The mechanism that creates the waves is usually located at the far end of the pool, usually where it is deepest. With some wave pools, the floor can be deeper in front of the wave machine, before quickly rising up, creating the wave shape, for example World Waterpark&#x27;s Blue Thunder Wave Pool.

*Compressed air. This works by air being blown onto the water in a chamber that has an opening underwater. When the air hits the water, it pushes it down, creating the waves. This can either work by air pumps being programmed to turn on and off to create the waves, or the air pumps constantly blowing with valves that open and close to create the waves.
*Paddle/Panel. A paddle or panel pushes the water, creating the waves. Usually behind the panel is a hydraulic or pneumatic piston that pushes the panel back and forth, in turn pushing the water. This can either work by the panel being on a hinge so it rotates back and forth (in this case the piston pushing it would be on a hinge too), or the panel sitting on rails. This method is becoming increasingly rare, due to the high maintenance it requires. A famous example of this mechanism is World Waterpark&#x27;s Blue Thunder Wave Pool 
*Water tank. This is usually the strongest type of wave machine, utilising large water tanks behind the pool that have water pumped into them, before a valve at its base opens. This allows the water to flow through a channel that slightly angles upwards as it enters the back of the pool, creating sometimes huge waves. When this happens, the wave machine can sometimes make a loud roaring sound, as the air fills the emptying chambers, for example on Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon. Famous examples include Siam Park&#x27;s Wave Palace, holding the record for largest man made waves at , and the previously mentioned Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon.
Other techniques utilize an &quot;accordion mechanism&quot; which opens and closes in order to suck water into its belly (opening) and push it out (closing) to cause waves.

== Types and locations ==

Generally, wave pools are designed to use fresh water at inland locations, but some of the largest ones, near other seashore developments, use salt water. Wave pools are typically larger than other recreational swimming pools and for that reason are often in parks or other large, open areas.

Some wave pools like those made by Wavegarden at Surf Snowdonia and NLand are expressly designed for surfing rather than for swimming, and accordingly, create much larger waves.
Other surfing wave pool projects, some of which can be in lakes, include Surf Ranch from Kelly Slater Wave Company, Surf Lakes, Webber Wave Pools and Okahina Wave. Surfing can also be done on a static surf simulator but is less realistic than surfing wave pools due to the static wave.

== Safety ==
Wave pools are more difficult to lifeguard than still pools as the moving water (sometimes combined with sun glare) make it difficult to watch all swimmers. Unlike passive pool safety camera systems, computer-automated drowning detection systems do not work in wave pools. There are also safety concerns in regards to water quality, as wave pools are difficult to chlorinate.

The original Tidal Wave pool at New Jersey&#x27;s Action Park cost three lives in the 1980s, and kept the lifeguards busy rescuing patrons who overestimated their swimming ability. On the first day they officially opened their wavepool, it is said up to 100 people had to be rescued.

== Record holders ==

The world&#x27;s largest wave pool by area is and located in Bangkok&#x27;s Siam Park City.

The largest indoor wave pool, &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, is and located at World Waterpark in West Edmonton Mall, Edmonton, Alberta.

The world&#x27;s largest artificial waves, measuring up to in height, can be found at Siam Park in the Canary Islands.

<text>Angus is a 1995 coming-of-age comedy film directed by Patrick Read Johnson. The cast includes Charlie Talbert and James Van Der Beek in their first film roles, along with Chris Owen, Ariana Richards, George C. Scott, Kathy Bates, and Rita Moreno. &quot;Angus&quot; is based on the short story &quot;A Brief Moment in the Life of Angus Bethune&quot; by Chris Crutcher, from his collection &quot;Athletic Shorts: Six Short Stories&quot;.

It is mostly filmed in Owatonna, Minnesota at Owatonna Senior High School.

==Plot==
Angus Bethune is a 14-year-old boy in Minnesota who, despite his talents in football and science, holds deep insecurities. Since kindergarten, he has been harassed by handsome, cruel Rick Sanford and his cohorts for not being &quot;normal&quot;. His only friend is Troy Wedberg, another social outcast. Angus has feelings for Melissa Lefevre, a cheerleader who is dating Rick. Tired of Rick&#x27;s abuse, Angus applies to a magnet school where he hopes to be free of the bullying. Well aware of Angus&#x27; feelings for Melissa, Rick rigs a school election so that Angus and Melissa will dance together in the upcoming Freshman Winter Ball as King and Queen, respectively. After the stunt, the principal forbids Angus to lay a hand on Rick, or he would be expelled and lose his chance to go to the magnet school.

To prepare for the dance, Angus gets help from Troy, his mother Meg, and his narcoleptic grandfather Ivan. Angus takes dancing lessons with Madame Rulenska, but the lessons go badly. Despite Angus&#x27; request for a black tuxedo, Ivan purchases a plum suit and tells him he can be normal and an individual at the same time. Ivan reasons that running away to another school will not solve anything and that he needs to stand up to Rick.

One day after school, Rick and his friends kidnap Troy and ask him for anything that would embarrass Angus at the Winter Ball. Troy refuses to help them, but ends up breaking his arm as he tries to get away. Meanwhile, Angus helps Ivan prepare for his wedding to his fiancée April. As Angus waits outside Ivan&#x27;s room on the day of the wedding, he confides to him about how he wishes he could stand up to Rick and tell Melissa how he feels. When Angus tries to wake Ivan, he quickly discovers that Ivan has died and tells the wedding guests. Distraught, Angus opts to stay home for a few days trying to cope with Ivan&#x27;s death.

Out of fear, Troy gives Rick a videotape containing footage of Angus practicing his dancing with an inflatable doll while confessing his feelings for Melissa. When Troy visits Angus to offer his condolences, an argument ensues. Angus asserts he won&#x27;t go to the Winter Ball because he doesn&#x27;t want to be humiliated by Rick again and needs to cope with his grandfather&#x27;s death.

Later that week, Angus receives a box from April containing the plum suit that he had earlier rejected. In that moment, Angus realizes Ivan was right all along: he needs to stand up for himself and face Rick, or nothing will change. He rejects an interview from the magnet school and marches to the dance in the school gymnasium wearing the plum suit. Troy tries to warn him that Rick is planning a terrible prank, but Angus refuses to back down and goes inside, meeting with Melissa for the first time. Before they can dance as King and Queen, Rick plays Troy&#x27;s videotape on the monitors, prompting laughter from students. A humiliated Melissa punches Rick in the face and runs out in tears. Angus follows her, infuriated at Troy for his betrayal.

Angus apologizes to Melissa, who reveals her disgust with Rick and confesses to Angus that she is bulimic. Angus learns that Melissa likes him more than Rick because he is kind and respectful of others. Finding common ground, they go back inside and dance, with Melissa helping him out with some of the steps. When Rick scolds Melissa, Angus comes to her defense. Rick punches Angus, breaking his nose and sending him crashing through a table. Angus defiantly rises to his feet and repeatedly pushes Rick until he falls to the ground, saying no matter how many times Rick knocks him down, he will always get back up. When Angus gives Rick a choice to accept others who are different from him, Rick selfishly replies, &quot;Whatever I am, it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re never gonna be,&quot; to which Angus retorts, &quot;Thank God!&quot; The students applaud Angus and even Rick&#x27;s friends abandon him. Melissa dances with Angus again and Troy enacts revenge on Rick by breaking his nose with his cast.

Melissa asks Angus to walk her home, and she kisses him on the cheek. Angus rejects an offer to transfer to the magnet school, realizing that his grandfather was right and that he doesn&#x27;t have to run away anymore. Angus mentions Rick was suspended for his video prank and for breaking Troy&#x27;s arm. He also mentions that Rick&#x27;s popularity with the other students suffered since Angus stood up to him and thus, they have no reason to fear him anymore.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Angus&quot; was released theatrically in North America on Friday, September 15, 1995, on 1,154 screens, debuting in eighth place amidst a crowded box office. It opened against &quot;Hackers&quot; and &quot;Clockers&quot;, while &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, and &quot;Braveheart&quot; were still having a strong showing in box office numbers. &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; ultimately won the weekend with $6,544,960 as it expanded to 1,448 screens.

In its second weekend, Sept 22–24, the film slipped to twelfth place with $1,314,839 from 1,156 screens, its widest release (a percentage drop of 31.3%). &quot;Se7en&quot; opened that weekend and won the box office with $13,949,807 from 2,441 screens.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Angus&quot; has a 67% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 18 reviews. Though some critics considered the film&#x27;s underdog story familiar and formulaic, others commended &quot;Angus&quot; for its accurate portrayal of high school life compared to similar films about adolescence, since it takes a critical look at obesity, bullying, self-esteem, and high school inclusiveness, while highlighting the importance of self-acceptance.

Godfrey Cheshire of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Jill Gordon’s script is emotionally ingenuous and pleasingly to-the-point, while Patrick Read Johnson’s skillful, unpretentious direction involves some fine work by cast’s appealing youngsters, especially Charlie Talbert as Angus and James Van Der Beek as Rick.” Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; also reviewed the film positively, writing, &quot;Slight and contrived as it is...[&quot;Angus&quot;] has a genuine warm spot for the outsider or socially awkward misfit -- and that covers just about everybody at one time or another.”

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined “‘&quot;Angus&quot;&#x27; is an easygoing if predictable alternative to more gimmicky teen-age fare&quot;, adding &quot;Mr. Scott and Ms. Bates help dignify the film without condescending to their material, and help bring home the universality of its familiar ideas about fitting in.”

Critic Emanuel Levy gave the film a &quot;C&quot;, but conceded Angus was &quot;played by newcomer Charles M. Talbert with a certain charm.&quot; Roger Ebert awarded the film three out of four stars and concluded &quot;Charlie Talbert is a good casting choice for Angus, because he isn&#x27;t a &#x27;sort of&#x27; fat kid, like those models in the King Size catalog who look about 12 pounds overweight. He is fat. But he is also smart, likable, resilient and engaging. And he has the gift of deflecting his shortcomings with humor.&quot;

The film was released on VHS on August 27, 1996. It was later shown in an edited-for-TV version on Turner-owned cable television stations.

On December 17, 2009, Warner Archive released the film on DVD.

In the years since &quot;Angus&quot;’ release, the film rights have been sold by New Line Cinema and are now privately owned. Responding to a fan about whether &quot;Angus&quot; will ever be reissued as a DVD or Blu-ray with the director’s cut version, Patrick Read Johnson said it would be a matter of significant fan support, in addition to recovering the original sound and film.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack includes the Weezer song &quot;You Gave Your Love to Me Softly&quot;, which was used in place of the track &quot;Wanda (You&#x27;re My Only Love)&quot; which had been written specifically for the film.

Green Day contributed the song &quot;J.A.R. (Jason Andrew Relva)&quot;, which was originally an unreleased track from the band&#x27;s &quot;Dookie&quot; sessions. Billie Joe Armstrong co-produced &quot;Back to You&quot; by the Riverdales with producer Mass Giorgini.

The music supervisors for the film were Elliot Cahn and Jeff Saltzman, who at the time managed Green Day and The Muffs.

<text>Buckner Stith Morris (August 19, 1800 – December 16, 1879) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1838–1839) for the Whig Party.

Morris married Evelina Barker in Kentucky in 1832 and the couple moved to Chicago in 1834 where Morris established a law practice with J. Young Scammon. He helped to create the Chicago Lyceum, the city&#x27;s first literary society. By 1835, however, Morris had left his partnership with Scammon, and was practicing law with Edward Casey. He was elected mayor of Chicago in 1838 and went would subsequently serve as Alderman from the 6th ward from 1839 to 1840 and again in 1844, resigning during his second tenure as alderman. He unsuccessfully ran for the office of Illinois Secretary of State in 1852 under the Whig ticket and served as a Lake County Circuit Court Judge from 1853 to 1855.

Following Evelina&#x27;s death in 1847, he married Eliza Stephenson in 1850. Eliza died in 1855. 

In 1856, he was the Know Nothing nominee for governor.

Morris was outspoken in his opposition to the American Civil War, and appeared to sympathize with the Copperheads. In 1864, he was arrested for aiding in a Confederate attempt to free prisoners of war from Camp Douglas in Chicago. He was held for 9 months, but was then exonerated by a military court. Being unable, while so detained, to attend to his business affairs, he lost most of his assets through foreclosures. Incensed over the treatment of their ancestor, his heirs refused to donate his papers to the Chicago Historical Society when they were requested.

The first use recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary of the phrase to hell in a hand basket, is in &quot;The Great North-Western Conspiracy in All Its Startling Details&quot;, by I. Windslow Ayer, in alleging that, at a meeting of the Order of the Sons of Liberty, Judge Morris of the Circuit Court of Illinois said: &quot;Thousands of our best men were prisoners in Camp Douglas, and if once at liberty would &#x27;send abolitionists to hell in a hand basket.&#x27;&quot; Note that he was portrayed as Judge Morris in that anecdote dated 1865, although his time on the bench was of the previous decade.
Morris was a member of Chicago&#x27;s oldest meeting Freemason Lodge, Oriental Lodge # 33.

Morris died in Chicago in 1879.

<text>Benjamin Wright Raymond (June 15, 1801April 6, 1883) was an American politician who twice served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1839–1840, 1842–1843) for the Whig Party.

==Early life==
Raymond was born in Rome, New York to Benjamin and Hannah Raymond, taking his middle name from his mother&#x27;s maiden name. Raymond was educated at St. Lawrence Academy in Potsdam, New York as well as in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He returned to East Bloomfield, New York and worked as a merchant before deciding to try his luck in real estate in Chicago in 1836 with the backing of his friend, Simon Newton Dexter. In 1835, he married Amelia Porter, the step-daughter of Judge Josiah Porter of East Bloomfield.

==Political career==
Raymond was twice elected mayor of Chicago. In 1839, he was elected the city&#x27;s third mayor, defeating James Curtiss. He unsuccessfully sought reelection in 1840, losing to Alexander Loyd. In 1842, he was elected to a second term as Chicago&#x27;s sixth mayor, defeating the incumbent, Francis Cornwall Sherman. At the time, mayoral terms were one year.

During his terms as mayor, Raymond ensured that State Street would be a wide thoroughfare. During his first year in office, he secured the site of Fort Dearborn for the city of Chicago when it was sold by the federal government.

From 1847 through 1848, Raymond served as alderman from the 3rd ward on the Chicago Common Council.

==Business career==
In 1843, after finishing his second term as Mayor, Raymond and Dexter built the first woolen factory in Illinois, in Elgin. Raymond also served as the president of the Fox River Railroad, which connected Elgin to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. In the 1850s, he was instrumental in securing the charter for Lake Forest University and building the city of Lake Forest, Illinois.

In 1864, approached by J.C. Adams of the Waltham Watch Company, Raymond agreed to put up the money to start a watch company in the Midwest. The men elected to build the company in Elgin, which donated of land to the entrepreneurs. The building was completed in 1866 and housed the Elgin Watch Company. The first model the company made was named the B.W. Raymond.

Raymond is buried in Graceland Cemetery, Chicago.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in the Republic of Moldova. In the years from 1918 through 1940 and 1941 through 1944, what is today the Republic of Moldova was part of Romania, so the Romanian political parties were active in Moldova.

<doc id="950267" wikidata="Q855934" url="?curid=950267" title="Devil's coach horse beetle">
<text>The devil&#x27;s coach-horse beetle (Ocypus olens) is a species of beetle belonging to the large family of the rove beetles (Staphylinidae). It was originally included in the genus &quot;Staphylinus&quot; in 1764, and some authors and biologists still use this classification.

==Etymology==
The Latin species name &quot;olens&quot;, meaning &quot;smelling&quot;, refers to the two white stinking glands on the abdomen. This beetle has been associated with the Devil since the Middle Ages, hence its common name, which has been used at least since 1840. Other names include devil&#x27;s footman, devil&#x27;s coachman, and devil&#x27;s steed. It is sometimes also known as the cock-tail beetle for its habit of raising its abdomen. 

One dictionary suggested that the name developed in parallelism with &quot;ladybird&quot; and its Norse cognates. In Irish, the beetle is called &#x27; or &#x27;. The Irish also called it &quot;the coffin cutter.&quot; British folklore has it that a beetle has eaten the core of Eve&#x27;s apple, and that a person who crushes such a beetle is forgiven seven sins.

==Subspecies==
Subspecies within this species include:
*&quot;O. o. azoricus&quot; (Méquignon, 1942) 
*&quot;O. o. olens&quot; (O. Müller, 1764)

==Distribution and habitat==
These very common and widespread beetles are present in most of Europe and in North Africa. They have also been introduced to parts of the United States and Canada, specifically Oregon, Washington, California, and parts of British Columbia. They prefer areas with damp conditions and can be found from April to October in meadows, heath and moorland, woodlands, hedgerows, and parks and gardens. During the day, they commonly stay under logs, stones, or leaf litter.

==Description==

It is a long-bodied, black beetle. At about , it is one of the larger British beetles. Its wing covers (elytra) are short, covering only its thorax, exposing the abdominal segments. The abdominal musculature is powerful and the abdominal segments are covered with sclerotized plates. It is capable of flight, but its wings are rarely used. It is covered with fine, black hairs. It is well known for its habit of raising its long and uncovered abdomen and opening its jaws, rather like a scorpion when threatened. Although it has no sting, it can give a painful bite with its strong, pincer-like jaws. It emits a foul-smelling odour, as a defensive secretion, from a pair of white glands at the end of its abdomen.

==Biology and diet==
It is a predator, hunting mainly by night, feeding on a range of invertebrates, including worms, slugs, spiders, and woodlice, as well as carrion. The prey is caught in the mandibles, which are also used to cut and together with the front legs to manipulate the food into a bolus. The bolus is repeatedly chewed and swallowed, emerging covered with a brown secretion from the foregut, until it is reduced to a liquid that is digested. Skin in the case of earthworms and hard materials from arthropods are left. The larvae are carnivorous with similar eating habits.

==Reproduction==
&quot;O. olens&quot; mates in autumn. Females lay their eggs from 2–3 weeks after first mating. They are large () and white with a darker band and laid singly in damp conditions under moss, stones, cow manure, or leaf litter. After around 30 days, the eggs split and the larvae emerge, white with a straw-coloured head. The larva lives largely underground, and feeds on similar prey to the adult and has the same well-developed mandibles. It adopts the same display with open jaws and raised tail when threatened.

The larva goes through three stages of growth (instars), the final stage ranging from 20 to 26 mm in length. Around 150 days old, the larva pupates for about 35 days and emerges as an adult with its final colouring, fully formed except for the wings, which cannot be folded neatly beneath the elytra for several hours. Adults can survive a second winter, some by hibernating in burrows and not emerging until March, while others remain active.

<text>Edward Timothy Sale (born February 5, 1942) is a former Manitoba politician who served as a member of the Premier Gary Doer&#x27;s cabinet.

==Biography==
The son of Edward Sale and Grace Watson, he was born in Goderich, Ontario, in 1942. He received Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Theology degrees from the University of Trinity College, and was subsequently ordained as an Anglican priest.

Sale moved to Manitoba after his graduation and joined a team ministry at St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church in Fort Garry from 1966 to 1969, and has been an honorary assistant in this parish since 1976. Later he worked with the United Church of Canada and then became executive director of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg. In the early 1990s, he taught at the University of Manitoba in the Department of Economics and the Faculty of Continuing Education. He also served as a Fort Garry school trustee from 1971 to 1977, spent eight years on the board of the United Way in Winnipeg, and was chief executive officer of Winnipeg&#x27;s Social Planning Council from 1976 to 1985.

Sale was a senior policy analyst for the provincial Ministry of Finance from 1985 to 1987, and served as Assistant Deputy Minister of Education from 1987 to 1989.

Sale was originally aligned with the Liberal Party of Canada, and there were some in the New Democratic Party of Manitoba who objected to his appointment as an assistant deputy minister for this reason. After being fired by Gary Filmon&#x27;s Tories, Sale&#x27;s political views shifted to the left. In 1991, he helped to found CHO!CES, a social activist group which opposed Filmon&#x27;s government. He also ran for the NDP in the central Winnipeg riding of Crescentwood in a 1992 by-election, and came within 400 votes of winning.

Sale ran again for Crescentwood in the 1995 provincial election, this time winning in a close three-way contest. He became one of the most vocal members of the NDP opposition, and served as the party&#x27;s critic for Industry, Trade and Tourism. Sale also played a leading role in exposing a vote-manipulation scandal involving the Independent Native Voice party and some senior advisors in Gary Filmon&#x27;s government.

The New Democrats under Gary Doer won the general election of 1999, and Sale was easily re-elected in the redistributed riding of Fort Rouge. He was appointed Minister of Family Services and Housing with responsibility for persons with disabilities in Doer&#x27;s first cabinet, and was transferred to the new portfolio of Science, Energy and Technology with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act and Manitoba Hydro on September 25, 2002. In the latter capacity, Sale has been a leading proponent of the environmental reforms outlined in the Kyoto Protocol. He was also the first Minister of Healthy Child Manitoba, which leads the Province&#x27;s early childhood development strategy. 
Sale was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, defeating his closest opponent by over 2700 votes. On October 12, 2004, he was appointed as Manitoba&#x27;s Minister of Health, and led efforts to shorten waiting lists and strengthen primary health care. 
In 2007, Sale retired and did not seek re-election. In 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by St. John&#x27;s College of the University of Manitoba in recognition of his work for social justice.

Sale criticized Manitoba Hydro in 2014 for failing to pursue the development of wind power for the province.

<doc id="950270" wikidata="Q399231" url="?curid=950270" title="Francis Cornwall Sherman">
<text>Francis Cornwall Sherman (September 18, 1805November 7, 1870) served as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois, for three terms (1841–1842, 1862–1865) as a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Sherman was born September 18, 1805, in Newtown, Connecticut. He married Electa Towbridge of Danbury, Connecticut.

==Early career in Chicago==
Sherman arrived in Chicago on April 7, 1834. He built a small boardinghouse, and used those profits to buy a stagecoach, establishing a stage line from Chicago to Galena, Joliet, Peoria, and other towns in Illinois. In 1835, he began to work in brick manufacturing and construction.

In July 1835, he was elected a village trustee, holding his seat for a year. In 1837, he opened the City Hotel, 
a hotel that would be later renamed the Sherman House. Also in 1837, after Chicago incorporated as a city, Sherman was elected an alderman from the 2nd ward on the newly created Chicago Common Council, and held this seat for one year.

==First mayoralty (1841–42)==
Sherman was elected mayor of Chicago in 1841, running as the Democratic nominee and defeating Whig nominee Isaac R. Gavin.

While the Wig Party had been national dominant in the recent 1840 national election, the party was discordant by March 1841 and ran a poor campaign in Chicago which aided the election of Democrats to eight of the Chicago Common Council&#x27;s twelve seats. Sherman was sworn in on March 4, 1841. At the time, Chicago had a population of only 5,000. Because of his party&#x27;s majority in the city council, the small size of the city, and the lack of contentious issues arising: Sherman&#x27;s first mayoralty was uncontroversial. His first mayoralty ended on March 7, 1842, when he was succeeded by Whig Benjamin Wright Raymond.

==City Treasurer, State Senate and Cook County Board of Commissioners==
After leaving office as mayor, Sherman held various other elected offices. He was City Treasurer of Chicago from 1842 through 1843. He then served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1844 through 1850. During this time, was a delegate to the 1847 Illinois constitutional convention.

In 1850, Sherman retired from his brickmaking venture in order to focus himself on public service and developing the properties that he owned. He expanded his hotel, adding two floors atop its existing three, and renaming it the &quot;Sherman House&quot;.

Sherman served Chairman of the Cook County Board of Commissioners from 1851 through 1853. Sherman ran in the contentious 1856 Chicago mayoral election as an anti-Nebraska Democrat. He lost to pro-Nebraska Democrat Thomas Dyer.

Sherman rebuilt and re-opened the Sherman House Hotel in 1861, making it one of the grand hotels of Chicago.

==Second mayoralty==
===Second term (1862–1863)===
Sherman was again elected mayor in the 1862 Chicago mayoral election, defeating Republican nominee Charles N. Holden. Sherman was sworn in as mayor on May 5, 1862.

Before the 1862 city elections, Republicans controlled city government in Chicago, holding both the mayoralty and a majority of seats on the Common Council. The Republican Party had enjoyed great recent success in Chicago elections. However, this changed in the 1862 elections. In March 1862, the Democratic-majority Illinois General Assembly passed a redistricting of council wards that gerrymandered the council&#x27;s election map to the Democratic Party&#x27;s advantage. Democrats also won the mayoralty. At the city Republican convention held before 1862 mayoral election, Charles N. Holden defeated John Wentworth (a popular former mayor and congressman) to secure the Republican mayoral nomination. Many angered supporters of Wentworth spited the Republican Party by instead voting for Sherman, aiding in his election. The low-turnout 1862 city elections saw the city government shift from Democratic to Republican control. With Democrats holding half of the council&#x27;s seats and Sherman able to cast tie-breaking votes, Democrats became the majority party on the council.

In November 1862, Sherman unsuccessfully ran for the United States House of Representatives, losing the Illinois 1st congressional district race to Republican Isaac N. Arnold.

Sherman and alderman John Comiskey had control over leading the Democratic bloc of the City Council, being opposed by the Republican bloc led by Charles C. P. Holden. Despite there being a slight Democratic majority (a 10 Democrat-10 Republican split, with Sherman able to cast tie-breaking votes), the city council was deadlocked in 1862 and early 1863. The deadlock became more severe when Holden led Republicans in refusing to attend meetings, thereby denying quorum. This was done in hopes of preventing Democrats from taking votes that Republicans feared might undercut the Union Army&#x27;s effort in the American Civil War. As a result, no meetings were able to be held between December 22, 1862, and March 23, 1863. The death of a Republican alderman and the absence of Republican alderman Edward Salomon (who was away fighting in the war) increased the Democratic majority on paper to a 10–8 majority. However, Democratic alderman Peter Shimp declared himself a &quot;War Democrat&quot;, effectively caucusing with the Republicans (as opposed to the &quot;copperhead&quot; Democratic majority). Presuming Salomon absence, Shimp&#x27;s newly declared allegiance gave the council an effective 9–9 split with Sherman remaining the tie-breaker. On March 23, 1863, the council held its first meeting with a quorum in months was assembled in order to select election judges for the city&#x27;s 1863 elections. Salomon attended, which surprised many as he had not announced beforehand that he attended to attend. Combined with the vote of Shimp, this gave the Republican bloc an effective majority at the meeting. The council passed a number of measures, including &quot;patriotic resolutions&quot; introduced by Holden that indicated the city&#x27;s support of the national government&#x27;s leadership in the war. Sherman vetoed a number of the &quot;patriotic resolutions&quot;.

Sherman appointed a committee that recommended a new city charter which extended the terms of the mayor, treasurer, collector, city attorney, clerk of police court from one to two years, and also added the communities of Bridgeport and Hostein to the city&#x27;s boundaries.

===Third term (1863–1865)===
Sherman was re-elected mayor in 1863, very narrowly defeating the Republican nominee Thomas Barbour Bryan. This election was the city&#x27;s first election to a newly extended term of two years. He was elected, in part, thanks to the new Irish-American and German-American population from Bridgeport and Holstein.

Sherman lost re-election in 1865, in a race that was won by Republican John Blake Rice after the race heavily turned in the Republican Party&#x27;s favor with sentiments shifting following the assassination of Republican president Abraham Lincoln days earlier. After the assassination, Sherman had all but formally withdrawn his candidacy. Sherman&#x27;s second mayoralty ended on May 3, 1865, when he was succeeded in office by Rice. Sherman would later try again to win a fourth term as mayor in the 1867 Chicago mayoral election, running once again as the Democratic nominee, once again losing to Rice.

==Death==
Sherman died at his home in Chicago on November 7, 1870. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Sherman and his wife Electa had seven children together.

Sherman&#x27;s son, Francis Trowbridge Sherman, was a brigadier general in the Union Army during the Civil War.

<text>The statutes of the State of Ohio have established 26 departments of government which are responsible to the Governor. These departments are led by the Director, or in some cases the Commissioner, who must inform and assist the governor in the operation of the state. After the governor appoints the potential director, they must be affirmed by the Ohio Senate.

No limit nor imposition are placed upon the terms, except in the cases that they may be replaced by the current governor, or they resign their term. In turn, the directors may appoint their own staff.

Since the governor appoints the Directors, they are directly incorporated into the Executive branch of Ohio. This gives them the broad authority to enforce the laws of Ohio directly. Many of these Departments issue administrative opinions, proceedings, and decisions, which in turn have the legal influence of stare decisis.

Notices and proposed rules are published in the &quot;Register of Ohio&quot;, which are codified in the &quot;Ohio Administrative Code&quot; (OAC).

==List of departments==

There are several cabinet or administrative departments:

* Ohio National Guard
* Department of Administrative Services
* Department of Aging
* Department of Agriculture
* Office of Budget and Management 
* Department of Commerce
* Development Services Agency
* Department of Developmental Disabilities

<doc id="950273" wikidata="Q4970979" url="?curid=950273" title="British Rowing">
<text>British Rowing, formerly the Amateur Rowing Association (ARA), is the national governing body for the sport of rowing (both indoor and on-water rowing). It is responsible for the training and selection of individual rowers and crews representing Great Britain and England, and for participation in and the development of rowing in England. Scottish Rowing (formerly SARA) and Welsh Rowing (formerly WARA) oversee governance in their respective countries, organise their own teams for the Home International Regatta and input to the GB team organisation.

British Rowing is a member of the British Olympic Association and the World Rowing Federation (formerly FISA).

==History==

The ARA (as the predecessor of British Rowing) had it roots in the desire to form crews drawn from the leading English clubs &#x27;for the purpose of defeating the foreign or colonial invader&#x27; although in fact this aim was not fulfilled until much later.

A series of meetings were held in Putney from 1877 culminating in the formation of the Metropolitan Rowing Association in 1879 by Cambridge University Boat Club, Dublin University Boat Club, Kingston Rowing Club, Leander Club, London Rowing Club, Oxford University Boat Club, Royal Chester Rowing Club, Thames Rowing Club and Twickenham Rowing Club. Molesey Boat Club joined soon afterward.

In 1882 the Metropolitan Rowing Association changed its name to the Amateur Rowing Association, having gained additional member clubs from outside London, and began its evolution into the governing body of rowing.

In 1886 the ARA issued General Rules for Regattas. The ARA adopted Henley Royal Regatta&#x27;s restrictive definition of &quot;amateur&quot; which not only excluded those who made their living as profession oarsmen but also anyone &quot;who is or has been by trade or employment for wages a mechanic, artisan or labourer.&quot; Moreover, the new rules stated that only clubs affiliated to the ARA could compete in regattas held under ARA rules, and that ARA affiliated clubs could not compete under any other rules, nor against crews not affiliated to the ARA. This ruling was extremely socially divisive, effectively excluding any club with a socially mixed membership. It resulted in the formation of a breakaway organisation in 1890, the National Amateur Rowing Association, whose clubs could draw their membership from all social classes and occupations.

The schism in English rowing was to remain for over half a century as a regular cause of controversy and bad feeling. Change only came after the Australian national eight, preparing for the Berlin Olympics in 1936, was excluded from the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley because the crew, who were all policemen, were deemed to be &#x27;manual workers&#x27;. The embarrassment caused persuaded the ARA and the Stewards of Henley Royal Regatta of the need for change, and on 9 June 1937, the offending references to manual labourers, mechanics, artisans and menial duties were deleted from the ARA rules, with Henley following suit the following day.

The ARA and NARA finally amalgamated in 1956.

David Lunn-Rockliffe, Executive Secretary of the ARA from 1976 to 1987 and later co-founder of the River and Rowing Museum at Henley-on-Thames, oversaw the transition to a more professional organization. In 1998, the ARA followed FISA in removing all references to amateurism from its rules. Professional rowers are now permitted. The name Amateur Rowing Association remained because of its heritage and because no agreement could be reached on alternatives. In 2009, a decision was taken to rename the organisation as &#x27;British Rowing&#x27;.

Five English rowing clubs retained the right to appoint representatives directly to the Council of British Rowing. They were: London Rowing Club, Leander Club, Thames Rowing Club, Oxford University Boat Club and Cambridge University Boat Club. This right was, however, removed from the five clubs in September 2012.

Sir Steve Redgrave, multiple Olympic Gold medallist in rowing, was the Honorary President of British Rowing from 2001 until 2013. Dame Di Ellis, former chairman of British Rowing, succeeded him as Honorary President. 
==Points system==

British Rowing operates a points system to allow race organisers to arrange races among rowers of a similar standard. Each individual rower can acquire Personal Ranking Index (PRI) separately for sculling and sweep rowing, and the crews in which they compete have a Crew Ranking Index (CRI) representing the combined total of each crew member&#x27;s PRI. While coxswains acquire a coxing PRI (in addition to a sweep rowing PRI and/or sculling PRI), this is not included in a CRI.

A PRI is based on the rower&#x27;s performances in both head races and regattas, every time they race. The number of points allocated depends upon how well they do relative to others and how many crews race. Points reduce automatically over time, so will drop if a rower stops competing or reduces the number of races they enter. The maximum number of points available from one event is 145. 

The PRI points system was introduced in September 2015. Prior to this, competitors gained points in both rowing and sculling by winning a qualifying race (a regatta race with more than 2 entries). When first joining British Rowing, all members begin at zero points. Points are increased by members winning qualifying regattas. The status levels were (high to low) Elite (ELI), Senior (SEN), Intermediate 1 (IM1), Intermediate 2 (IM2), Intermediate 3 (IM3), Novice (NV). Each crew members&#x27; points were added up and this determined the status of the crew. The crew was only allowed to race at this level or higher (e.g. an IM1 crew can only race at IM1, SEN or ELI). Anyone who had competed for the GB Senior, Lightweight or U23 international squads was given 12 points (then the maximum possible) and those representing GB at the World Rowing Junior Championships had their points topped up to 6. The new points system allows race organisers to divide entries more flexibly, depending on the entries received. The table below indicates the maximum number of points that could be held by a crew at each status level under the pre-2015 system:

===Juniors===
There are a number of junior categories (J12, J13, J14, J15, J16, J17 and J18). The number represents the age competitors must be younger than, before the first day of September preceding the event. Sweep oar rowing is only allowed at J15 and older for both boys and for girls, due to possible issues of asymmetric muscle development (coxswains excepted).

==Coaching awards==
British Rowing has an awards scheme for coaching that up until 2005 consisted of the Instructor&#x27;s Award, Bronze Award, Silver Award and finally the Gold Award. These were overhauled in 2006 as qualifications were brought in line with the Sportscoach UK system that many other sports in the UK have adopted. British Rowing now offers the Level 2 (Session Coach and Club Coach), Level 3 (Senior Club Coach) and Level 4 (Advanced Coach) coaching awards and other related workshops and training courses.

==Nautilus Rowing Club==
British Rowing occasionally fields boats under the name of the Nautilus Rowing Club (boat code NAU).

<text>Augustus Garrett (1801 – November 30, 1848) was an American politician who twice served as Mayor of Chicago (1843–1844, 1845–1846). He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life and career==
Garrett married Eliza Clark in 1825 in Newburgh, New York. The couple&#x27;s daughter Imogene was born in 1830. Departing New York, the Garretts lived in Cincinnati for a time, but had to flee the city after getting in debt. Moving to New Orleans, the couple&#x27;s young daughter died of cholera in 1833 and was buried on the banks of the Mississippi. Garrett gave birth to a second child, a son named Charles, in 1834. The Garretts also had another son, John.

== Move to Chicago ==
Facing difficulties in New Orleans as well, the Garretts separated for a short while - Augustus to Chicago, while Eliza returned to Newburgh. Reuniting in 1835 in Chicago, the couple worked in real estate and prospered. Garrett had a small auction house near the Chicago River and by the following year had formed a partnership with the Brown Brothers, which allowed him to become a leading land speculator and auctioneer. By October 1836, he had sales of more than $1.8 million.

From 1840 through 1841, he served as Chicago alderman from the 2nd ward.

==Mayoralties==
In 1842, Garrett ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Chicago. He ran again in 1843 and was elected.

In 1844, Garrett initially won re-election, only to have the election invalidated based on charges of &quot;illegal proceedings and fraud.&quot; Garrett ran in a second election that year, but lost to Alson Sherman.

Garrett was again elected mayor in 1845.

During his terms in office, Garrett pushed to have the first brick school in Chicago, Dearborn School, turned into either a warehouse or an insane asylum, believing that the building was too large for use as a school.

==Death and legacy==

Augustus Garrett died at the Sherman House Hotel in Chicago on November 30, 1848, and was buried in Rosehill Cemetery. Following his death, Eliza established the Garrett Bible Institute, now Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, in nearby Evanston, Illinois.

<text>Kathleen H. Liebert (born October 1, 1967, in Tennessee) is an American professional poker player.

== Poker ==
Liebert started her professional poker career as a prop player in Colorado. She would later go on to enter tournaments and she won the first Party Poker Million event in 2002, the first limit poker tournament with a $1 million prize.

She has made six World Poker Tour (WPT) final tables, including a third-place finish in the 2005 Borgata Poker Open, making her the highest finishing woman on the WPT until a runner-up finish by J. J. Liu in the 2007 Bay 101 Shooting Stars tournament. Liebert went on to tie the record at the 2009 Shooting Stars tournament, placing second to Steve Brecher in the longest final table in WPT history. Her record was broken on March 5, 2008, when Van Nguyen became the first woman to win a televised WPT mixed event at the WPT Invitational in Commerce, California.

At the 2004 World Series of Poker, Liebert won a gold bracelet in a $1,500 Limit Texas hold &#x27;em Shootout event. Along with (Cyndy Violette and Annie Duke she was one of three women to win an open event in that year&#x27;s WSOP. Liebert also appeared on and won the series 2005 Poker Royale: Battle of the Sexes. After being eliminated from the World Speed Poker Open in London in September 2005, Kathy provided commentary on the final table alongside Gary Jones. On June 1, 2008, Liebert made the final table of the $10,000 Pot-Limit Hold&#x27;em World Championship at the 2008 World Series of Poker and finished in 3rd place, earning $306,064.

As of 2022, she has one World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet and her total live tournament winnings exceed $6,650,000.

Already a 2010 inductee of the Women in Poker Hall of Fame, in 2022 Liebert was nominated for the Poker Hall of Fame.

Liebert now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada and Downey, California.

<text>Alson Smith Sherman (April 21, 1811 – September 22, 1903) served as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1844–1845) as an Independent Democrat.

==Biography==
Sherman was born to Nathanial Sherman and Deborah (Webster) on April 21, 1811, in Barre, Vermont.

Sherman established the first sawmill in Chicago and served as the city&#x27;s first iceman. 

In the three years before he was elected mayor, Sherman served as chief of Chicago&#x27;s fire department.

In 1844, Sherman ran for mayor of Chicago after an initial election was invalidated based on charges of &quot;illegal proceedings and fraud.&quot; He ran as an Independent Democratic nominee against incumbent Democrat Augustus Garrett and Liberty Party nominee Henry Smith, winning the office with just over 50% of the vote.

As mayor, he oversaw the city&#x27;s purchase of its first piece of fire-fighting equipment and appointed Denis Swenie as fire chief. 

In 1849 he won a special election to replace E.H. Chapin, who had resigned from the Chicago City Council, as an alderman for the city&#x27;s third ward. He won a full term in 1850. 

In 1850, he became one of the original trustees of Northwestern University. 

He moved to Waukegan, Illinois, in 1856. In the 1870s, when a canal being dug in Lemont, Illinois, revealed Athens marble, Sherman was instrumental in developing the marble quarry there. He died in Waukegan on September 22, 1903, and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery.

<doc id="950287" wikidata="Q5433597" url="?curid=950287" title="Fan District">
<text>The Fan is a district of Richmond, Virginia, so named because of the &quot;fan&quot; shape of the array of streets that extend west from Belvidere Street, on the eastern edge of Monroe Park, westward to Arthur Ashe Boulevard. However, the streets rapidly resemble a grid after they go through what is now Virginia Commonwealth University. The Fan is one of the easterly points of the city&#x27;s West End section, and is bordered to the north by Broad Street and to the south by VA 195, although the Fan District Association considers the southern border to be the properties abutting the south side of Main Street. The western side is sometimes called the Upper Fan and the eastern side the Lower Fan, though confusingly the Uptown district is located near VCU in the Lower Fan. Many cafes and locally owned restaurants are located here, as well as historic Monument Avenue, a boulevard formerly featuring statuary of the Civil War&#x27;s Confederate president and generals. The only current statue is a more modern one of tennis icon Arthur Ashe. Development of the Fan district was strongly influenced by the City Beautiful movement of the late 19th century.

The Fan District is primarily a residential neighborhood consisting of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century homes. It is also home to VCU&#x27;s Monroe Park Campus, several parks, and tree-lined avenues. The District also has numerous houses of worship, and locally owned businesses and commercial establishments. The Fan borders and blends with the Boulevard, the Museum District, and the Carytown district, which features the ornate Byrd Theatre.

Main east-west thoroughfares include Broad Street, Grace Street, Monument Avenue, Patterson Avenue, Grove Avenue, Floyd Avenue, Main Street, Parkwood Ave, and Cary Street.

==Architecture ==
Following a succession of owners, an architecture museum, the Virginia Center for Architecture, took occupancy in 2005 of Branch House on Monument Avenue, a residence designed in the Tudor style by the firm of John Russell Pope in 1914.
The Fan is known for having one of the longest intact stretches of Victorian architecture in the United States, however much of the housing stock was actually built after the end of the Victorian era and is arguably more Edwardian and Revival in style. While housing in the Eastern parts of the neighborhood are quintessential Victorian styles, such as Italianate and Queen Anne, housing stock further west was constructed in the first decades of the twentieth century and exhibits the pared back victorianism of Edwardian architecture. Homes still contain gables and turrets, but detail is normally executed in a simplified classical form. Colonial Revival and American Craftsman architecture are common as well, with Revival architectural types arguably the most common (as was common to the time period) Revivalism (architecture).
Primary architectural styles represented include: 
* Italianate
* Richardsonian Romanesque
* Queen Anne
* Colonial Revival

Other architectural styles include:
* Tudor Revival
* Second Empire
* Beaux-Arts
* Art Deco
* Spanish
* Gothic Revival
* Bungalow
* American Arts and Crafts Movement
* James River Georgian
* Southern Colonial
* Jacobethan (Jacobean Revival)
* Federal

==History ==

In 1817, the Fan was plotted as the village of Sydney on land formerly owned by William Byrd II. Primary development of the Fan occurred after the Civil War through about 1920. Streetcar lines leading from downtown influenced development; the nation&#x27;s first electric streetcar system was inaugurated in Richmond in 1888.

As development increased from downtown at the turn of the 20th century, Franklin street became a fashionable &quot;West End&quot; address. A desire for a West End address drove rapid real estate development of the area, changing the area from rural tobacco fields in 1880 to being almost fully developed land by the 1920s. As development accelerated, the University of Richmond (then located on Lombardy Street) was moved west to a more rural location (its present Westhampton location). During the Great Depression, many of the single-family homes in the area were converted to apartments.

The term &quot;the Fan&quot; was coined in the mid 20th century by a Richmond Times Dispatch editorial, as the appellation &quot;West End&quot; no longer applied. In 1985, the Fan was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and various buildings around the Fan are adorned with plaques noting this and when the building was built.

<doc id="950288" wikidata="Q2421000" url="?curid=950288" title="Novelization">
<text>A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, stage play, comic book, or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film&#x27;s script and on a tight deadline.

==History and purpose==

Novelizations of films began to be produced in the 1910s and 1920s for silent films such as &quot;Les Vampires&quot; (1915–16) and &quot;London After Midnight&quot; (1927). One of the first films with spoken dialogue to be novelized was &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). Film novelizations were especially profitable during the 1970s before home video became available, as they were then the only way to re-experience popular movies other than television airing or a rerelease in theaters. The novelizations of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979) sold millions of copies.

The first ever video game to be novelised was &quot;Shadowkeep&quot;, in 1984.

Even after the advent of home video, film novelizations remain popular, with the adaptation of &quot;Godzilla&quot; (2014) being included on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for mass-market paperbacks. This has been attributed to these novels&#x27; appeal to fans: about 50% of novelizations are sold to people who have watched the film and want to explore its characters further, or to reconnect to the enthusiasm they experienced when watching the film. A film is therefore also a sort of commercial for its novelization; the film&#x27;s success or failure affects the novelization&#x27;s sales. Conversely, film novelizations help generate publicity for upcoming films, serving as a link in the film&#x27;s marketing chain.

According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization. This makes these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of blockbuster film franchises. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has been credited with these works gaining a &quot;patina of respectability&quot; after they had previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.

== Variants ==
=== Film ===

The writer of a novelization is supposed to multiply the 20,000–25,000 words of a screenplay into at least 60,000 words. Writers usually achieve that by adding description or introspection. Ambitious writers are driven to work on transitions and characters just to accomplish &quot;a more prose-worthy format&quot;. Sometimes the &quot;novelizer&quot; invents new scenes in order to give the plot &quot;added dimension&quot;, provided they are allowed to do that. Publishers aim to have novelizations in shops before a film is released, which means it is usually necessary to base the novelization on a screenplay instead of the completed film. It might take an insider to tell whether a novelization diverges unintentionally from the final film because it is based on an earlier version which included deleted scenes. Thus the novelization occasionally presents material which will later on appear in a director&#x27;s cut. In some cases, separate novelizations of the same film are written for publication in different countries, and these may be based on different drafts of the screenplay, as was very clearly the case with the American and British novelizations of &quot;Capricorn One&quot;. Writers select different approaches to enrich a screenplay. Dewey Gram&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot;, for example, included historical background information.

If a film is based on a novel, the original novel is generally reissued with a cover based on the film&#x27;s poster. If a film company also wishes to have a separate novelization published, the company is supposed to approach the author who has &quot;Separated Rights&quot;. A writer has these rights if he contributed the source material (or added a great deal of creative input to it) and if he was moreover properly credited.

Novelizations also exist where the film itself is based on an original novel: novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote a novelization of the James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Although the 1962 Ian Fleming novel was still available in bookstores, its story had nothing to do with the 1977 film. To avoid confusion, Wood&#x27;s novelization was titled &quot;James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. This novel is also an example of a screenwriter novelizing his own screenplay. &quot;Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot; was published under the name of George Lucas but his script had been novelized by the prolific tie-in writer Alan Dean Foster.

Acquiring editors looking for a novelizer have different issues. The author may not have all of the information needed; Foster wrote the &quot;Alien&quot; novelization without knowing what the Xenomorph looked like. The contract may be very restrictive; Max Allan Collins had to write the novelization for &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; only based on the film, without the detail he had created for the graphic novel of the same name that the film is based on. Rewrites of scripts may force last-minute novelization rewrites. The script for the 1966 film &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; was rewritten by five different authors. The writer or script doctor responsible for the so-called &quot;final&quot; version is not necessarily the artist who has contributed the original idea or most of the scenes. The patchwork character of a film script might even exacerbate because the film director, a principal actor or a consulting script doctor does rewrites during the shooting. An acquiring editor who intends to hire one of the credited screenwriters has to reckon that the early writers are no longer familiar with the current draft or work already on another film script. Not every screenwriter is available, willing to work for less money than what can be earned with film scripts and able to deliver the required amount of prose on time. Even if so, there is still the matter of novelizations having a questionable reputation. The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers concedes that by saying their craft is &quot;largely unrecognized&quot;. Writers Guild of America rules require that screenwriters have right of first refusal to write novelizations of their own films, but they rarely do so because of the lack of prestige and money.

Some novels blur the line between a novelization and an original novel that is the basis of a film adaptation. Arthur C. Clarke provided the ideas for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Based on his own short stories and his cooperation with Kubrick during the preparation and making of this film adaptation he wrote the film novelization of the same name which is appreciated by fans because the film provides little exposition, and the novelization fills in some blanks. David Morrell wrote the novel &quot;First Blood&quot; about John Rambo, which led to the film adaptation of the same name. Although Rambo dies at the end of his original story, Morrell had a paragraph in his contract stipulating he remained &quot;the only person who could write books about Rambo&quot;. This paid off for him when the film producers changed the ending and decided for a sequel. David Morrell accepted to carry out the novelization and negotiated unprecedented liberties which resulted in a likewise unprecedented success when his book entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and stayed there for six weeks.

Simon Templar or James Bond are examples of media franchises that have been popular for more than one generation. When the feature film &quot;The Saint&quot; was released in 1997 the creator of this character (Leslie Charteris) had already been dead for four years. Hence its novelization had to be written by another author. Ian Fleming on the other hand had official successors who wrote contemporary &quot;Post-Fleming&quot; James Bond novels. During his tenure John Gardner was consequently chosen to write the novelization of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; in 1989 and also the novelization of &quot;GoldenEye&quot; in 1995. John Gardner found his successor in Raymond Benson who wrote besides several original Bond novels three novelizations including &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;.

===Comics===
While comic books such as the series &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; have often provided adaptations of novels, novelizations of comics are relatively rare. &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, written by George Lowther and published in 1942, is the first novelization of a comic book character.

===Video games===
Video games are novelized in the same manner as films. While gamers might enjoy playing a certain action scene for hours, the buyers of a novelization might be bored soon if they merely read about such a scene. Consequently, the writer will have to cut down on the action.

==Authors==
Novelization writers are often also accomplished original fiction writers, as well as fans of the works they adapt, which helps motivate them to undertake a commission that is generally compensated with a relatively low flat fee. Alan Dean Foster, for example, said that, as a fan, &quot;I got to make my own director&#x27;s cut. I got to fix the science mistakes, I got to enlarge on the characters, if there was a scene I particularly liked, I got to do more of it, and I had an unlimited budget. So it was fun&quot;.

Writing skill is particularly needed for challenging situations common to writing novelizations of popular media, such as lack of access to information about the film, last-minute script changes and very quick turnaround times. Collins had to write the novelization of &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; in nine days.

Although novelizations tend to have a low prestige, and are often viewed as &quot;hackwork&quot;, several critically acclaimed literary authors have written novelizations, including Arthur Calder-Marshall, William Kotzwinkle and Richard Elman. Best-selling author Ken Follett, early in his career, also wrote a novelization, and so did Isaac Asimov, later in his career. While increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing still has the disadvantages, from the writers&#x27; point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.

The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers is an American association that aims to recognize the writers of adapted and tie-in fiction. It hands out annual awards, the &quot;Scribes&quot;, in categories including &quot;best adapted novel&quot;.

=== TV series===
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; had stories novelised in particular from the era of its original series published by Target Books.

Episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; were adapted into short stories by the noted science fiction writer James Blish. Each volume of the stories included a number of the short story adaptations. Alan Dean Foster would later adapt the follow-up animated series into the &quot;Star Trek Log&quot; series.

Mel Gilden wrote novelizations of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, merging three episodes into one book. As he explained, this approach required him to look for a joint story arc.

===Comics ===
In the early 1970s Lee Falk was asked by the Avon publishing house to deliver Phantom novels based on the eponymous comic strip. Falk worked on the novelizations on his own and with collaboration. A dispute over how he would be credited led to the cessation of the series.

Peter O&#x27;Donnell, who scripted the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; comic strip, later authored novels featuring the character not directly based on the stories presented in the strips.

===Video games===
Matt Forbeck became a writer of novels based on video games after he had been &quot;writing tabletop roleplaying game books for over a decade&quot;. He worked also as a designer of video games.

S. D. Perry wrote a series of novels based on the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; video games and added tie-ins to the novelizations, covering all the mainline titles in the series up until &quot;Resident Evil Zero&quot;.

Eric Nylund introduced a new concept for a novelization when he delivered a trilogy, consisting of a prequel titled &quot;&quot;, an actual novelization titled &quot;&quot; and a sequel titled &quot;&quot;.

Raymond Benson novelized the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; in 2008 and its sequel &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, while Project Itoh wrote a Japanese language novelization of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; also in 2008 (with an English adaptation later published in 2012). Itoh was set to write novelizations of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, but his death in 2009 resulted in these projects being handed to &quot;Beatless&quot; author Satoshi Hase and a new writer named Hitori Nojima (a pen name for Kenji Yano) respectively. Kojima would go on to write &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Substance&quot; (a two-part alternate novelization of the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;), as well as the novelizations of &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; and &quot;Death Stranding&quot; (a game which he helped write the script for).

==Orphaned novelizations==
In some cases an otherwise standard novel may be based on an unfilmed screenplay. Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1961 James Bond novel &quot;Thunderball&quot; was based on a script he had co-written; in this case his collaborators subsequently sued for plagiarism.

Peter O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s novel &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; was a novelization of a refused film script. In this case the creator of the main character had written the script alone, but later on other authors had changed O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s original script over and over, until merely one single sentence remained from the original. The novel was released a year before the film and unlike the film it had sequels.

Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Alternative&quot; was based on an unfilmed script he had written.

Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; was adapted from a screenplay the author wrote. This allowed the Coen brothers to stick &quot;almost word for word&quot; faithfully to the book when adapting it back into a screenplay for the acclaimed 2007 film of the same name.

Occasionally a novelization is issued even though the film is never made. Gordon Williams wrote the script and novelization for producer Harry Saltzman&#x27;s abandoned film &quot;The Micronauts&quot;.

<text>John Putnam Chapin (April 21, 1810 – June 27, 1864) served as the 10th Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1846–1847) for the Whig Party.

Chapin left his hometown to enter the mercantile business in Haverhill, New Hampshire before moving to Chicago in 1832. In Chicago he became a member of the wholesale and retail merchants firm Wadsworth, Dyer &amp; Chapin until it was dissolved in 1843. Following the dissolution of the firm, Chapin joined the Canal Boat Transportation Company. He was a founding member of the Chicago Board of Trade.

From 1844 to 1845, Chapin served a single term as Chicago alderman from the 1st ward.

In 1846, Chapin ran for mayor of Chicago as a Whig against Democratic nominee Charles Follansbee and Liberty Party nominee Philo Carpenter, winning the office with just over 55% of the vote.

Following his term as Mayor, Chapin was elected to the city council in 1859. In 1861, he was nominated by the Union ticket for the office of Commissioner of Public Works. Since Chapin was a staunch Republican, he declined the nomination as he felt it was a mischievous move on the part of the Democrats.

He died in Chicago on June 27, 1864, and was buried at Graceland Cemetery.

<text>James Curtiss (also Curtis; March 29, 1806 – November 2, 1859) was an American politician who twice served as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1847–1848 and 1850–1851) for the Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Born on March 29, 1806, in Wethersfield, Connecticut, Curtiss became a printer&#x27;s apprentice at an early age in Philadelphia. He worked for a time at the Portland &quot;Argus&quot;, then was printer, and eventually editor and publisher of the Eastport &quot;Northern Light&quot;, a Jackson Democrat newspaper. He married Mary Kimball on May 18, 1830. From 1830 through 1835, he served as a postmaster in Eastport. In 1834, Curtiss was under investigation by the Postmaster General for his management of the office.

==Political career in Chicago==
Curtiss arrived in Chicago from Eastport, Maine, in 1835 and became editor of the &quot;Chicago Democrat&quot;. Almost immediately after his arrival in Chicago Curtiss began a career of public service.

Shortly after his arrival in Chicago, he was appointed States Attorney for the district north of the Kankakee River. He was appointed to Chicago&#x27;s first Board of Health. He succeeded Ebenezer Peck as Town Clerk in September 1836. He also opened a short-lived law practice with William Stuart in 1836 named Stuart and Curtiss, which was dissolved the following year.

The Panic of 1837 left a large number of land investors unable to meet their obligations. In hopes of delaying the resulting foreclosures Curtiss and others had unsuccessfully attempted to delay the opening of the Municipal Court that winter.

Curtiss was elected alderman for the 2nd ward in 1838. In 1839, he ran in Chicago&#x27;s third mayoral election, losing to Benjamin Wright Raymond. In 1842, he was elected City Clerk. In 1843, he was made Corresponding Secretary of the Chicago chapter of the Washington Temperance Society. In 1845, the Illinois Legislature created the Court of Cook County and appointed Curtiss as its first clerk. In 1846, he was elected as alderman again, this time for the 3rd ward.

===First mayoral term===
Curtiss became mayor after winning the 1847 election, running a successful campaign against Philo Carpenter (Liberty Party) and John H. Kinzie (Whig). He was sworn in on March 9, 1847.

He lost his bid for reelection in 1848, being defeated by James Hutchinson Woodworth (an independent Democrat who ran on a fusion ticket supported by Whigs and Democrats). His tenure ended on March 14, 1848, when Woodworth succeeded him in office.

During Curtiss&#x27; tenure Chicago&#x27;s first telegraph line opened on January 11, 1848, and the Chicago Board of Trade was established.

===Second mayoral term===
Curtiss returned to the mayor&#x27;s office after winning the 1850 Chicago mayoral election, defeating Levi Day Boone and Lewis C. Kerchival (both of these challengers being Democrats without formal party nomination). He was sworn in on March 12, 1850.

Curtiss was again defeated in his bid for reelection, losing the 1851 election to Walter S. Gurnee. His tenure ended on March 11, 1851, when he was succeed in office by Gurnee.

In 1852, he sought to unseat Gurnee, but again lost.

==Retirement from politics==
Retiring from politics, Curtiss moved to West Urbana (now Champaign) Illinois in 1855, and took up farming.

==Death==
Curtiss died on November 2, 1859, in Joliet, Illinois, after a long illness. His funeral was held at the Second Presbyterian Church on Wabash Avenue following the Odd Fellows rites. Originally buried in City Cemetery, when the Cemetery was moved to make way for Lincoln Park, his remains were lost.

<text>James Hutchinson Woodworth (December 4, 1804 – March 26, 1869), was a member of the Illinois State Senate and the Illinois State House of Representatives, served as a Chicago Alderman, was elected to consecutive terms as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1848–1850) as an Independent Democrat, and served one term in the US House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. Woodworth completed his career in Chicago as one of the city&#x27;s most noteworthy bankers. He is a member of the Woodworth political family.

==Personal life==

He was born in Greenwich in Washington County, New York, the son of Connecticut natives Eleazer Woodworth and Catherine Rock Woodworth. His father died when Woodworth was young. He received limited schooling and completed his formal education by the time he was 14. Woodworth&#x27;s various brothers figured prominently in his life. At various times, they provided employment, provided training or other support for career changes, and served as business partners. Woodworth&#x27;s life illustrated a steady progression westward as the center of the United States was opened after the Louisiana Purchase. He eventually settled in Chicago and was instrumental in insuring its place as the nation&#x27;s most prominent midwestern trading city.

In Chicago, Woodworth married Almyra Booth, the daughter of Walter Booth of Paris, Illinois. She was a member of the Booth family that settled in Indiana from their homes in Connecticut; their American ancestry stretched back to the founder of Connecticut, the Reverend Thomas Hooker. The Booth family was noted for its interest in public service, and this both influenced and supported Woodworth&#x27;s own career in politics. Almyra Booth was related to both California Governor Newton Booth and the author Booth Tarkington. Woodworth and Almyra Booth had three children, two of whom died in infancy. Their daughter Virginia Almyra Woodworth was married to Tunis B. Van Wyck whose own ancestry could be traced back to the earliest inhabitants of the Dutch colonies in the New World, including the New Amsterdam and Long Island colonies which eventually became New York State. Through Virginia Van Wyck, the Woodworths had one surviving grandchild, Virginia Almyra Van Wyck who married George Pope of Glencoe, Illinois.

Woodworth is buried in the Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago, together with his wife Almyra, their three of his children and a brother, Frank L. Woodworth.

==Early business career==

Woodworth began his career by helping his older brother run the family farm in Washington County, New York. When Woodworth was 19 his brother arranged the exchange of the family farm in Washington County, NY for a farm in Onondaga County, New York. He continued to work on the new family farm in Onondaga County, New York, for his brother until he was 21. In his last two years of farming in Onondaga County, we worked to clear land and erect buildings on a tract of land known at the time as the &quot;Indian Reservation.&quot;

Upon leaving farming, he struck out initially to run a dry goods business. Despite his limited education, he became a school teacher in the local school district of Fabius, New York. In 1826, he was appointed inspector of the common schools. He briefly considered a career as a physician while working for another brother, Dr Robert P. Woodworth. In 1827, he decided to work along the Erie Canal. There he and another Woodworth brother operated a small scale dry goods or trading business and lived in Erie, Pennsylvania. From 1829 to 1832, he served as a justice of the peace in Pennsylvania.

Woodworth arrived in Chicago in 1833, the first year of its incorporation as a city in Cook County, when its population totaled 500. He immediately began operating a dry goods business which continued until 1840. In 1835, while operating his dry goods business, he applied for, and received, wharfing privileges. He eventually contracted to work on the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. He briefly left Chicago for Marseilles, LaSalle County, Illinois, to oversee his interest in saw-mills; the Marseilles mills were considered among the most advanced mills of their time. He returned to Chicago in 1842 when the mills were destroyed in a fire. His business endeavors in this period sometimes included other business partners such as one of his brothers, Dr. Robert P. Woodworth. After he returned from LaSalle County he purchased a flouring milling operation that was connected to the pumps and reservoirs of the Chicago Hydraulic Co. He was invited at various times to serve the community in a series of elected political offices.

==Political life==
Woodworth began his political career in Chicago in 1839. He first served in the Illinois State Senate from 1839 to 1842, when he was elected to fill a vacancy from the Chicago district. He then served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1842 to 1847, representing LaSalle, Grundy, and Kendall counties.

He was a Chicago Alderman, serving as a member of the Chicago City Council, known then as the Common Council, from 1845 to 1848. He ran for mayor in 1848 and was elected in a landslide, and then was re-elected for a second consecutive term with a substantial majority in the face of limited organized opposition. He was the first politician elected to two successive mayoral terms in Chicago.

===Mayor of Chicago===
Woodworth ran for mayor as an Independent Democrat during a period when the national political parties, the Whigs and the Democrats, experienced great upheaval. His Mayoral campaign represented a stunning blow to the Democratic party of Chicago, unseating the Democratic Party&#x27;s Mayor, James Curtiss; it would take the Democrats and Curtiss two full election cycles to regain the Mayoral office. The short lived Independent Democrats of Chicago is an early example of a successful large city &quot;fusion party.&quot;

Woodworth was sworn in as mayor on March 14, 1848.

As mayor, Woodworth presided over the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal on April 16, 1848. Woodworth was instrumental in opening Chicago to all major railroads. His political opponents had preferred restricting the railroads&#x27; access to Chicago; the more liberal policy adopted by Woodworth, which permitted each railroad to have its own terminal in addition to access, enhanced the position of Chicago as a central trading location for the entire Midwest. He also facilitated the installation of telegraph lines to the west; on January 15, 1848, the first telegraph message to be received in Chicago was sent from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and received in Chicago, Illinois. By 1849, Woodworth&#x27;s pro-commerce policies had established Chicago as an outfitting center for gold seekers heading west to seek their fortunes. During his terms the city&#x27;s population grew to 20,000. By the end of his two mayoral terms Chicago had been transformed from a bustling frontier trading town to one of the major centers of commerce in the Midwest with a major stake in the opening of the West to the entire country.

During Woodworth&#x27;s terms as Mayor, Chicago was challenged by a series of disasters. The first disaster was an outbreak of cholera; Woodworth responded to the cholera epidemic by building a municipal sewer system. On March 12, 1849, there was a great flood caused by excess ice on the waterways. On July 21, 1849, Chicago was ravaged by a major fire which destroyed Tremont House in addition to a sizable number of other buildings.

Woodworth&#x27;s two inaugural addresses displayed consistent attention to several issues central to the development of Chicago. He voiced concern over the city&#x27;s deficit financial position and in his second term shored up the finances through new loans. He requested additional funding for the Fire Department, the employment of physicians in the city&#x27;s hospitals, repairs and improvements to the city&#x27;s roads, waterways and wharfing facilities, the city jail, the city cemetery and the Chicago Public School system.

In 1850, as Mayor, he presided over a meeting of anti-slavery citizens who voted a resolution to declare their &quot;utter abhorrence at all compromises that permitted the further extension of human slavery; condemning a compromise scheme attributed to Douglas by the press.&quot;

His tenure ended on March 12, 1850, when he was succeeded in office by James Curtiss.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
In Illinois, the Whigs eventually became the Republican Party. Woodworth held anti-slavery views, and the short-lived fusion Independent Democratic party he headed in Chicago merged with the Whigs to form the Illinois Republican Party. Woodworth did not stand for re-election in 1850 and returned briefly to private life as a banker in Chicago, but returned to public service in 1853, serving as the Water Commissioner, until his election to the United States Congress in the elections of 1854. He served one term as the Representative of the Second District of Illinois in the 34th United States Congress from 1855 to 1857 and there served as a member of the Republican Party. At the end of his term in Congress, Woodworth did not stand for re-election, stated that he sought &quot;a release from public cares,&quot; and returned to private life in Chicago for the second time in his life as a banker.

==Later business career==
Finance and banking became a growth industry in its own right in the city&#x27;s continued rapid expansion as a major Midwest trading center. The status of Chicago as a financial center was challenged in the 1850s as there were many &quot;runs on banks&quot; and several outright bank failures.

===Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank of Chicago===
After his consecutive terms as Mayor of Chicago, Woodworth served as President of the Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank of Chicago. His appointment to the bank is noteworthy as commentators of the day ascribed the bank&#x27;s return to health, and even vigorous success, during a time of banking crisis, to Woodworth&#x27;s character and the benefits of his great many personal business relationships in the Chicago trading community. He buttressed the bank&#x27;s finances at one point in 1852 by taking a $50,000 loan from his father-in-law Walter Booth, the one time Mayor of Paris, Illinois. Booth&#x27;s loan to the bank was secured by the &quot;current worth of the owners of the Merchants&#x27; Bank.&quot; His tenure at this bank ended in 1855 when he took his seat in Congress.

===Treasury Bank of Chicago===
After his term in Congress, he returned to banking in Chicago and became the President of the Treasury Bank of Chicago. During the Civil War Woodworth remained a private citizen and, as can be verified by his public record, held neither elected political office nor military position. Woodworth accepted a part-time appointment from Illinois Governor Richard Yates to oversee federal financial transfers to the state during the Civil War as a member of the Board of Auditors of War Claims, known also as the Commissioners of the War Fund. The War Fund and the Board of Army Auditors were authorized under a special session of the Illinois General Assembly. This was a role Woodworth played while principally occupied at the Treasury Bank of Chicago. He continued as President of this bank until his death.

==Legacy==
Many landmarks and institutions remain in Chicago reflecting his career contributions. It is a testament to his popularity that he counted working relationships with both Democrat and Republican politicians of the Civil War and mid-19th century era in Chicago:

===Civil War Era in Chicago===
Mayor Woodworth did not serve in the military during the Civil War; and, by the time of the war, had returned permanently to commerce as a banker. Nonetheless, he had accepted a civilian war time appointment on the Board of Auditors of War Claims from Governor Yates, a Republican. As a banker, Woodworth worked at the forefront of Municipal Finance to develop Chicago&#x27;s infrastructure, including one of the largest military prisons for captured Confederate troops. His strict anti-slavery views stemmed from the perspective that the economic future of Chicago as a great metropolitan center was best advanced where all residents were free and able to seek a role in the commerce of the city; this popular metropolitan perspective on slavery contrasted with the agrarian perspective popular in the Confederate states where slavery was considered a necessary aspect of the farming economy.

===Higher Education in Chicago===
Despite his own limited education, Woodworth showed a keen interest in education as Mayor seeking funding for the public schools of the city. Later, as a leading banker in Chicago, Woodworth dedicated much of this time to the creation of Chicago&#x27;s first university, now known as &quot;Old&quot; Chicago University. His partner in this endeavor was Stephen A. Douglas, possibly the most prominent Democrat of his era, Woodworth was a founding trustee of Chicago University and later served at its treasurer. Chicago University was the precursor to the University of Chicago and to Northwestern University&#x27;s School of Law. As university trustee, and its treasurer, he was credited with financially sustaining the university during its early years when its finances were precarious. The financial failure of Chicago University was linked to Mayor Woodworth&#x27;s untimely death. A bankruptcy reorganization following his death allowed the books, land and some buildings of Chicago University to re-emerge as the new University of Chicago. As part of that reorganization, the law school of Chicago University, Chicago&#x27;s first law school, became the Law School of Northwestern University.

===Chicago as the USA&#x27;s Midwestern Center of Commerce===
Woodworth presided over several events that cemented Chicago&#x27;s position in the nation&#x27;s economy. As Mayor he pushed aside various municipal factions that opposed the presence of railroads in the city center, to allow all railroads serving Chicago to be served by a central railroad station; this permitted efficient transfer of cargo between the various railroads. Woodworth assured the position of Chicago as a trading center by supporting the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and strengthening the Chicago waterways and wharfing systems against flooding and inclement winter weather. Chicago&#x27;s transportation system became unique in the midwest as railroad and water traffic met in a central city location. The first telegraph message was received in Chicago when Woodworth was mayor, and the first commodity futures contracts began trading on Chicago exchanges at this time. As a private banker, Woodworth&#x27;s successful bank positioned Chicago as a central national banking center, well before the USA established the current national system of Federal Reserve banks, and during a period where bank failures were frequent.

===Development of Modern Chicago===
Chicago&#x27;s population grew dramatically during Woodworth&#x27;s tenure are Mayor and during the periods where he was active in commerce. He presided over the opening of Bridgeport, Chicago, the new residential area of Chicago that has been home to several Chicago Mayors.

===Lincoln funeral===
Woodworth was a contemporary, and friend, of Abraham Lincoln. Woodworth permitted his Independent Democrat party of Chicago to join with the Whig Party of Illinois to form the Illinois Republicans. This gave the Illinois GOP the depth in voters, financial support, and a strong base in Chicago, needed to support Lincoln&#x27;s ascendance to the Presidency. Although he was not one of the 12 Chicago pallbearers, Woodworth did serve as a member of Chicago&#x27;s Committee of One Hundred, which marched in the funeral cortege of Abraham Lincoln during its passage through Chicago, on its way to Springfield, Illinois.

===Chicago Astronomical Society===
He also served as a founding trustee of the Chicago Astronomical Society, an appointment made under the Society&#x27;s act of incorporation passed by the Illinois General Assembly; a full copy of the act of incorporation can be found on the Society&#x27;s website.

===James Woodworth Prairie Preserve===
In more recent years, his grandson, John Woodworth Leslie, was instrumental in saving a virgin prairie preserve near Chicago to serve as an historical reminder of how the region appeared when Woodworth was mayor. That prairie preserve is known as the &quot;James Woodworth Prairie Preserve,&quot; or the &quot;Woodworth prairie.&quot; It is located off Milwaukee Avenue in Glenview, Illinois. The University of Illinois at Chicago and its Department of Biological Sciences oversee the prairie. The prairie covers &quot;5 acres... of original tallgrass prairie... [and]... the only natural area owned by the University of Illinois at Chicago... [The Woodworth prairie] serves the community by providing an opportunity to experience prairie plants and animals that are now rare... [and it provides] a challenge to understand how communities can be preserved.&quot;

<text>David Duvall Orr (born October 4, 1944) is an American Democratic politician who served as the Cook County Clerk from 1990 to 2018. Orr previously served as alderman for the 49th ward in Chicago City Council from 1979 to 1990. He briefly served as acting Mayor of Chicago from November 25 to December 2, 1987, following the death of Mayor Harold Washington. Orr retired from the office of Cook County Clerk in 2018, opting not to run for an eighth term.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Orr is a graduate of Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa for his undergraduate and his Masters Degree in American Studies from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He was an instructor at Mundelein College in 1979, when he first decided to run for alderman.

==Chicago City Council (1979-90)==
Orr entered politics as an &quot;independent Democrat&quot;, opposed to the official Democratic Party organization. The party organization was then controlled by the &quot;Machine&quot; created by Mayor Richard J. Daley, who died in December 1976. In February 1979, Orr was elected by a narrow margin of 320 votes alderman from the 49th Ward, which covered most of the Rogers Park neighborhood in the far northeastern corner of Chicago. 

Orr was considered a lakefront liberal.

Orr joined with other white &quot;independent&quot; aldermen from the &quot;Lakefront&quot; and black dissident aldermen from the south side and west side in opposing the corruption and racism of the Machine. Orr was re-elected in February 1983 and 1987. 

In February 1983, with the Machine divided between supporters of Jane Byrne and Richard M. Daley, black independent Harold Washington became Mayor. Washington was opposed by 29 aldermen who tried to paralyze city government for three years in what was dubbed &quot;Council Wars.&quot; Orr backed Washington, one of only five white aldermen to do so. After the Washington coalition won the majority in 1986, after special aldermanic elections were held, Orr was elected by the City Council in 1987 to serve as the city&#x27;s Vice Mayor. 

In 1986, Orr, with the assistance of fellow alderman Bernard Stone, successfully pushed an ordinance through City Council that declared Chicago a &quot;nuclear-free zone&quot;.

As a city councilman, Orr often prevailed in getting the council to take actions which he fought for. Orr had a reputation of being a &quot;clean&quot; politician, devoid of corruption or negativity. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Mike Royko, a cynic towards local politics, stated in 1988, &quot;there are three or four aldermen who are suspected of being honest and [Orr] is one of them.&quot;

In May 1988, the City Council voted to oust Orr from his position as Vice Mayor as retribution for his attempts to make reforms that would have held the council&#x27;s committees more accountable for the budgets they manage.

After Orr resigned from the City Council in 1990 in order to serve as county clerk, then-mayor Richard M. Daley appointed Robert Clarke as his replacement. In the 1991 aldermanic election, Clarke was defeated by Joe Moore, whom Orr had endorsed.

===Acting Mayor of Chicago (1987)===
When Mayor Washington died of a heart attack on November 25, 1987, Orr, as Vice Mayor, became acting mayor. He took office on November 25 and served for a week until the Council elected a permanent replacement mayor. Orr was suggested as the obvious choice, but as a reformer, he was vehemently opposed by the remaining Machine aldermen, and many black Chicagoans wanted a black replacement for Washington. Alderman Eugene Sawyer, who was black, and before 1983 had been a Machine loyalist, was chosen instead on December 2, 1987. Orr chaired Council meetings as mayor on December 1, a memorial meeting for Washington, and on December 2, when Sawyer was selected as his replacement.

==County Clerk (1990-2018)==
In 1990, the office of Cook County clerk was vacated by Stanley T. Kusper, Jr. who ran unsuccessfully for president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Orr ran for the office, and won the Democratic primary handily with 56% of the vote against two opponents. He also won easily in the general election, receiving more votes than any other candidate for county office. He was re-elected in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014. In 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010, he was unopposed for renomination, and faced only token opposition in the general election.

After taking office, Orr put in place reforms, including instituting a new ethics guide for employees of the Office of the Cook County Clerk.

In 1994, Orr was considered a potential front-runner if he entered the election for president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, but he ultimately decided to run for reelection as clerk instead of seeking the position.

On June 21, 2017, he announced that he would not run for reelection to an eighth term. Karen Yarbrough, the then-Cook County Recorder of Deeds, succeeded Orr as the Clerk.

==Subsequent career and activity==
In 2013, Orr was appointed as a Senior Fellow at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies in the University of Chicago.

In June 2018, Orr founded a political action committee called Good Government Illinois, with the goal of supporting election reform, campaign finance reform, and candidates with shared goals. He supported several candidates in the 2019 Chicago aldermanic election, including Maria Hadden (who ran for his old 49th ward seat), Michael Rodriguez, Andre Vasquez, Matt Martin, Susan Sadlowski Garza, David Moore, and Scott Waguespack.

Orr considered running for mayor of Chicago in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election after incumbent mayor Rahm Emanuel declared in early September 2018 that he would no longer be seeking a third term. However, he ultimately did not run. In the week prior to the first round of the election, Orr publicly endorsed the candidacy of Lori Lightfoot.

In the 2023 Chicago mayoral election, Orr endorsed U.S. Representative Chuy Garcia&#x27;s candidacy for mayor.

== Accolades ==
In 2012, Orr was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.

<doc id="950305" wikidata="Q808036" url="?curid=950305" title="Bardo, Poland">
<text>Bardo is a historical town in Ząbkowice Śląskie County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Bardo.

Bardo lies on the Eastern Neisse river, flowing out of the Kłodzko Valley towards the Silesian Lowlands. It is located approximately south-west of Ząbkowice Śląskie, and south of the regional capital Wrocław. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 2,440.

The town is a widely known place of pilgrimage and adoration of the Virgin Mary.

==History==

Bardo was founded in the 10th century as a Polish defensive gord on a medieval trade route from Prague across the Sudetes via Kłodzko to Wrocław and Gniezno. The surrounding area was populated by Lechitic tribes and became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century under first historic ruler Mieszko I of Poland. Bardo&#x27;s castellans were Polish knights. They secured the southern border of the Lower Silesian lands with adjacent Kłodzko Land in Bohemia.

In 1096 Duke Bretislaus II of Bohemia captured and devastated the fortress, nevertheless in 1137 it returned to Poland. The following year, due to the fragmentation of Poland, Bardo became part of the Polish Duchy of Silesia. From 1278 it belonged to the Duchy of Jawor under the Piast duke Bolko I the Strict, from 1321 to the Duchy of Ziębice under Duke Bolko II. With Ziębice, Bardo was vassalized by the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1336, however, it remained under rule of local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty until 1428.
Its chapel was built in the 10th century, and it was first mentioned in 1189 as being granted to the Knights Hospitaller by the Bishops of Wrocław. In 1210 it passed to the Canons Regular at Kamieniec Abbey. By 1290 the gord had lost its strategic importance and ceased to exist as a castellany. In 1299 the whole area was purchased by the Cistercian order and was owned by them until 1810. The image of the Madonna dates back to the 13th century, probably the oldest in Silesia. The Baroque pilgrimage church was erected between 1686 and 1704. The sanctuary was visited twice by the future Pope John Paul II, in 1957 and 1978. In 1981 a monument of Pope John Paul II was unveiled in Bardo, as the second in Poland after Kraków.

After the First Silesian War, Bardo along with most of Silesia was annexed by Prussia in 1742. In 1826, Fryderyk Chopin travelled through the town. From 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, and after the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II it became again part of Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference. Also in accordance with the agreement, the German population was expelled and Bardo was repopulated by Poles, most of whom were themselves expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. In 1949–1950 Greeks and Macedonians, refugees of the Greek Civil War, were temporarily admitted in Bardo, before new homes were found for them in other towns. Following the Korean War, in 1956–1959, Poland admitted 400 North Korean orphans in Bardo.

Bardo had gained the status of a town in the early 14th century, but this was lost as the result of the destruction caused by World War II. It became the seat of a gmina in 1954, and was granted town status again in 1969.

<text>A memory hole is any mechanism for the deliberate alteration or disappearance of inconvenient or embarrassing documents, photographs, transcripts or other records, such as from a website or other archive, particularly as part of an attempt to give the impression that something never happened. The concept was first popularized by George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, where the Party&#x27;s Ministry of Truth systematically re-created all potentially embarrassing historical documents, in effect, re-writing all of history to match the often-changing state propaganda. These changes were complete and undetectable.

==Origins==
In &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the &quot;memory hole&quot; is a small chute leading to a large incinerator used for :censorship:

&quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;&#x27;s protagonist Winston Smith, who works in the Ministry of Truth, is routinely assigned the task of revising old newspaper articles in order to serve the propaganda interests of the government. In one instance, the weekly chocolate ration was decreased from 30 grams to 20. The next day the newspaper announced that the chocolate ration had not been reduced to 20 grams per week, but &quot;increased&quot; to 20 grams. Any previous mention of the ration having been 30 grams per week needed to be destroyed.

The memory hole is referenced while O&#x27;Brien tortures Smith; O&#x27;Brien produces evidence of a coverup by the Party, exciting Smith that such documentation exists. However, O&#x27;Brien then destroys the evidence in the memory hole and denies not only the existence of the evidence but also any memory of his actions. Smith realizes that this is doublethink in action, as O&#x27;Brien has actively suppressed his memory of both a politically inconvenient fact and his action taken to destroy the evidence of it.

<text>Delicious (stylized del.icio.us) was a social bookmarking web service for storing, sharing, and discovering web bookmarks. The site was founded by Joshua Schachter and Peter Gadjokov in 2003 and acquired by Yahoo! in 2005. By the end of 2008, the service claimed more than 5.3 million users and 180 million unique bookmarked URLs. Yahoo sold Delicious to AVOS Systems in April 2011, and the site relaunched in a &quot;back to beta&quot; state on September 27 that year. In May 2014, AVOS sold the site to Science Inc. In January 2016 Delicious Media, a new alliance, reported it had assumed control of the service. 

In June 2017 Delicious was acquired by Pinboard, and the bookmarking service was discontinued.

== Functionality ==
Delicious used a non-hierarchical classification system in which users could tag each of their bookmarks with freely chosen index terms (generating a kind of folksonomy). A combined view of everyone&#x27;s bookmarks with a given tag was available; for instance, the URL http://delicious.com/tag/wiki displayed all of the most recent links tagged &quot;wiki&quot;. Its collective nature made it possible to view bookmarks added by other users.

Delicious also allowed users to group links with similar topics together to form a &quot;Stack&quot;, and include title and descriptions for the Stack page. Stacks could be worked on collaboratively with other users, and could be followed and shared with other users. Stacks were added in September 2011 and removed in July 2012.

Delicious had a &quot;hotlist&quot; on its home page and &quot;recent&quot; pages, which helped to make the website a conveyor of Internet memes and trends. Users could also explore stacks on the home page by navigating categories such as Arts &amp; Design or Education.

All bookmarks posted to Delicious were publicly viewable by default, although users could mark specific bookmarks as private, and imported bookmarks were private by default. The public aspect was emphasized; the site was not focused on storing private (&quot;not shared&quot;) bookmark collections. Delicious linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, RSS feeds, and the site&#x27;s daily blog posting feature could be used to display bookmarks on weblogs.

== History ==

The precursor to Delicious was Muxway, a link blog that had grown out of a text file that Schachter maintained to keep track of links related to Memepool. In September 2003, Schachter released the first version of Delicious. In March 2005, he left his day job to work on Delicious full-time, and in April 2005 it received approximately $2 million in funding from investors including Union Square Ventures and Amazon.com.

When Delicious was first launched, it was the first use of the term &quot;tag&quot; in the modern sense, and it was the first explicit opportunity where website users were given the ability to add their own tags to their bookmarks so that they could more easily search for them at a later time. This major breakthrough was not much noticed as most thought the application at the time &quot;cool&quot; but obvious.

Yahoo acquired Delicious on December 9, 2005. Various guesses suggest it was sold for somewhere between US$15 million and US$30 million. In 2018, Schachter said the actual number was &quot;definitely less&quot; than US$30 million.

On December 16, 2010, an internal slide from a Yahoo meeting leaked, indicating that Delicious would be &quot;sunsetted&quot; in the future, which seemed to mean &quot;shut down&quot;.
Later Yahoo clarified that they would be selling Delicious, not ending it. This news resulted in Delicious users looking for alternative sites. This benefited Pinboard, also a bookmarking site, which saw a huge surge of traffic and activity on its site. Various other services such as Google Bookmarks and Spabba also offered bookmarks migration tools to allow users to migrate and safeguard their bookmarks out of Delicious.

On April 27, 2011, Delicious announced the site was sold to Avos Systems, a company created by Chad Hurley and Steve Chen. Unbeknownst to members, Yahoo continued to operate the site until September 2011.

On September 26, 2011, Delicious launched its completely new version 3.0 design in beta. This redesign came in as a surprise to many of its users, with many features being disabled, removed or temporarily unavailable. AVOS Systems removed the Delicious Support Forum and had advised users that communication with Avos should take place via email. Reaction from users was overwhelmingly negative.

On November 9, 2011, AVOS Systems announced that they had acquired the link-saving service, Trunk.ly. Trunk.ly offered to automatically save all links that users have &quot;liked&quot; on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. This acquisition led to the launch of Twitter Connector on Delicious on March 2, 2012.

On May 8, 2014, Science, Inc. announced it had acquired the Delicious website from AVOS, without acquiring staff. Science, Inc. is a &quot;technology investment and advisory firm&quot;, which said it intended to keep the site &quot;largely as is&quot;.

On January 11, 2016, the Delicious blog announced ownership had transitioned to a new company formed between Science and of Domainersuite.

On June 1, 2017, Pinboard acquired Delicious. The service was shut down and became read-only on June 15, and its users have been encouraged to subscribe to the Pinboard service.

As of July 15, 2020, Maciej Ceglowski, owner of Pinboard, announced plans to restore the site to a explorable state and allow data export provided users have their login credentials.

=== Under Avos Systems ===
After being purchased by AVOS Systems on April 27, 2011, Delicious went through significant UI redesigns and became more social.

On September 26, 2011, Delicious launched its completely new version 3.0 design in beta. Delicious added a new feature called Stacks that allows users to group multiple related links into a single page, and customize the Stack by adding title, description and a featured image.

On December 13, 2011, Delicious continued its work to redesign its site, including UI changes to link-saving page and Stacks page. The new design, especially for the Stacks page, was similar to the design of another popular social photo-sharing website Pinterest.

On January 20, 2012, Delicious added more social features into its Stacks page, allowing users to collaborate on the same Stack, as a public Stack or a private Stack among a group of users. The users can also comment on a stack and create a stack as a response to the original stack. This new social feature was considered as a good step against competitor such as Pinterest which did not offer private boards at the time.

On March 2, 2012, Delicious continued its effort to be more social, by providing a Twitter Connector that allows users to connect their Twitter accounts to their Delicious accounts. This new feature allowed tweeted links to be automatically saved into the Delicious account.

On July 20, 2012, Delicious reversed its position on the Stacks feature. All Stacks created by members were converted to tags in early August, 2012, without any loss of member data. This was part in response to AVOS&#x27;s direction for Delicious and partly from feedback from Delicious members, many of whom felt that Stacks were trying to emulate features of the visual bookmarking site, Pinterest.

== Name ==
The &quot;del.icio.us&quot; domain name was a well-known example of a domain hack, an unconventional combination of letters to form a word or phrase.

In an interview Schachter explained how he chose the name: &quot;I&#x27;d registered the domain when .us opened the registry, and a quick test showed me the six letter suffixes that let me generate the most words. In early discussions, a friend referred to finding good links as &#x27;eating cherries&#x27; and the metaphor stuck, I guess.&quot;

On September 6, 2007, Schachter announced the website&#x27;s name would change to &quot;Delicious&quot; when the site would be redesigned. The new design went live on July 31, 2008. In January 2016, changes to the website were announced, including a move back to &quot;del.icio.us&quot;.

On April 24, 2016, Delicious transitioned back to &quot;del.icio.us&quot;.

<doc id="950311" wikidata="Q1819369" url="?curid=950311" title="The Catlins">
<text>The Catlins (sometimes referred to as The Catlins Coast) comprise an area in the southeastern corner of the South Island of New Zealand. The area lies between Balclutha and Invercargill, straddling the boundary between the Otago and Southland regions. It includes the South Island&#x27;s southernmost point, Slope Point.

A rugged, sparsely populated area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, both of which harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker&#x27;s sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.

People have lived in the area since around 1350 AD. Prior to European settlement, the region was sparsely inhabited by nomadic groups of Māori, most of whom lived close to river mouths. In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers, and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s.

Tourism has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy, which otherwise relies heavily on dairy farming and fishing.

The region&#x27;s population has fallen to less than half its peak in the early 20th century. Some 1,200 people now live in the Catlins, many of them in the settlement of Owaka. This is linked to population centres to the north and southwest via the area&#x27;s only major road, part of the Southern Scenic Route. Owaka contains the area&#x27;s main school, the Catlins Area School, catering for students from year 1 to year 13. There are three other small primary schools throughout the Catlins district. Owaka also has a medical centre, the nearest hospital being in Balclutha. The Catlins is governed at local level as part of the Clutha and Southland Districts and is represented at national level as part of the Clutha-Southland electorate.

== Geography ==
The Catlins area covers some and forms a rough triangular shape, extending up to inland and along a stretch of coast in extent. The mouths of two large rivers, the Clutha River in the northeast and the Mataura River in the west, mark its coastal limits. To the north and northwest, the rough bush-clad hills give way to rolling pastoral countryside drained and softened by the actions of tributaries of these two rivers such as the Pomahaka River.

The rugged, scenic coastline of the Catlins features sandy beaches, blowholes, a petrified forest at Curio Bay, and the Cathedral Caves, which visitors can reach at low tide. Much of the coastline consists of high cliffs, up to in height, and the land rises sharply from the coast at most points. For this reason, many of the area&#x27;s rivers cascade over waterfalls as they approach the ocean (notably the iconic Purakaunui Falls on the short Purakaunui River).

The South Island&#x27;s southernmost point, Slope Point, projects near the southwestern corner of the Catlins. To the west of this lies Waipapa Point, often considered the boundary of the Catlins region, beyond which lies the swampy land around the mouth of the Mataura River at the eastern end of Toetoes Bay. But various people place the western boundary of the Catlins region in different places, and some more stringent definitions exclude even Slope Point. A proposed boundary circulated in 2009 by the New Zealand Geographic Board ran roughly north from Slope Point, then inland around the Catlins Ranges and east to Nugget Point. Tourist organisations objected, asking that the boundary be moved further west to include Fortrose.

Several parallel ranges of hills dominate the interior of the Catlins, separated by the valleys of the Ōwaka, Catlins and Tahakopa Rivers, which all drain southeastwards into the Pacific Ocean. The most notable of these ranges is the Maclennan Range. Between them, these hills are often simply referred to as the Catlins Ranges. Their northwestern slopes are drained by several tributaries of the Clutha and Mataura Rivers, most notably the Mokoreta River, which flows mainly westwards, reaching the Mataura close to the town of Wyndham.

The highest point in the Catlins, Mount Pye () stands north-northeast of Waikawa and close to the source of the Mokoreta River, and marks part of the Otago-Southland border. Other prominent peaks above include Mount Rosebery, Catlins Cone, Mount Tautuku, and Ajax Hill. The Catlins has several small lakes, notably scenic Lake Wilkie close to the Tautuku Peninsula. Catlins Lake, near Owaka, actually consists of the tidal estuary of the Catlins River.

Shipping has found the Catlins coast notoriously dangerous, and many shipwrecks have occurred on the headlands that jut into the Pacific Ocean here. Two lighthouses stand at opposite ends of the Catlins to help prevent further mishaps. The Nugget Point Lighthouse stands above the water at the end of Nugget Point, casting its light across a series of eroded stacks (the &quot;nuggets&quot; which give the point its name). It was built in 1869–70. The Waipapa Point light, which stands only above sea level, was the last wooden lighthouse to be built in New Zealand, and was constructed in 1884 in response to the tragic 1881 wreck of the &quot;Tararua&quot;. Both of these lighthouses are now fully automated.
Due to its position at the southern tip of New Zealand, the Catlins coastline lies exposed to some of the country&#x27;s largest ocean swells, often over . The region has enjoyed a growing reputation for big wave surfing, with regular competitions, award-winning rides, and coverage on the Discovery Channel gathering publicity for the sport. The Department of Conservation proposed protecting the Papatowai surf break in 2008, citing its national significance for surfing.

The landscape of the Catlins features in many poems by celebrated poet Hone Tuwhare. Born in Northland, Tuwhare lived in Kaka Point from 1992 until his death in 2008, and became one of the area&#x27;s best-known inhabitants. His family plan to establish a writers&#x27; retreat at his crib there. The film &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;, starring comedians Bret McKenzie and Hamish Blake, was filmed in the Catlins early in 2011.

== Climate ==
The Catlins has a cool maritime temperate climate, somewhat cooler than other parts of the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds can reach considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island&#x27;s storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.

The Catlins—and especially its central and southern areas—experiences considerably higher precipitation than most of the South Island&#x27;s east coast; heavy rain occurs infrequently, but drizzle is common and the region averages around 150 days of rain per year. Rain days are spread fairly evenly throughout the year; there is no particularly rainy season in the northern Catlins, and only a slight tendency towards more autumn rain in the southwest. The average annual rainfall recorded at the Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre is about , with little variation from year to year.

Fine days can be sunny and warm, and daily maxima may exceed in mid-summer (January/February). A more usual daily maximum in summer would be . Snow is rare except on the peaks even in the coldest part of winter, though frost is quite common during the months of June to September. Typical daily maximum temperatures in winter are .

== History ==
The first people known to live in the Catlins, Māori of the Kāti Māmoe, Waitaha, and Kāi Tahu iwi (tribes), merged via marriage and conquest into the iwi now known as Kāi Tahu. Archaeological evidence of human presence dates back to approximately 1350 AD. The area&#x27;s inhabitants were semi-nomadic, travelling from Stewart Island / Rakiura in the south and inland to Central Otago. They generally dwelt near river mouths for easy access to the best food resources. In legend, the Catlins forests further inland were inhabited by &quot;Maeroero&quot; (wild giants).

The Catlins may have offered one of the last places where the giant flightless bird, the moa, could be hunted, and the timber of the forest proved ideal for canoe construction (the name of the settlement &quot;Owaka&quot; means &quot;Place of the canoe&quot;). No formal Māori pā (villages) were located in the Catlins, but there were many hunting camps, notably at Papatowai, near the mouth of the Tahakopa River.

Europeans first sighted the area in 1770 when the crew of James Cook&#x27;s &quot;Endeavour&quot; sailed along the coast. Cook named a bay in the Catlins area &quot;Molineux&#x27;s Harbour&quot; after his ship&#x27;s master Robert Molineux. Although this was almost certainly the mouth of the Waikawa River, later visitors applied the name to a bay to the northeast, close to the mouth of the Clutha River, which itself was for many years known as the Molyneux River. The town of Port Molyneux, located on this bay, was a busy harbour during the 19th century. Its location at the mouth of the Clutha made it a good site for trade both from the interior and for coastal and ocean-going shipping. A major flood in 1878 shifted the mouth of the Clutha to the north and silted up the port, after which the town gradually dwindled.

Sealers and whalers founded the first European settlements in the early years of the 19th century, at which time the hunting of marine mammals dominated European economic activity in New Zealand. A whaling station was established on the Tautuku Peninsula in 1839, with smaller stations at Waikawa and close to the mouth of the Clutha River.

The Catlins take their name from the Catlins River, itself named for whaling captain Edward Cattlin (sometimes spelt Catlin). He purchased an extensive block of land along Catlins River on 15 February 1840 from Kāi Tahu chief Hone Tūhawaiki (also known as &quot;Bloody Jack&quot;) for muskets and £30 (roughly NZ$3000 in 2005 dollars). New Zealand&#x27;s land commissioners declined to endorse the purchase, however, and the Māori received much of the land back after long negotiations ending more than a decade after Cattlin&#x27;s death.

During the mid-19th century the area developed into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand&#x27;s worst shipping disasters occurred here: the wreck of the passenger-steamer &quot;Tararua&quot;, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.

Another noted shipwreck, that of the &quot;Surat&quot;, occurred on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1874. This ship, holed on rocks near Chasland&#x27;s Mistake eight kilometres southeast of Tautuku Peninsula, limped as far as the mouth of the Catlins River before its 271 immigrants abandoned ship. A beach at the mouth of the Catlins River is named Surat Bay in commemoration of this wreck. The schooner &quot;Wallace&quot; and steamer &quot;Otago&quot; were also both wrecked at or near Chasland&#x27;s Mistake, in 1866 and 1876 respectively, and a 4534-ton steamer, the &quot;Manuka&quot;, ran aground at Long Point north of Tautuku in 1929. In all there were eight shipwrecks of note between 1839 and 1892.

After a decline in the 1890s, the logging of native timber expanded into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. A series of bushfires destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which continues to be a mainstay of the Catlins&#x27; economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.

Medical pioneer Dr Truby King established a farm at Tahakopa and a Catlins timber mill from the 1890s to the 1920s, and gave some of his mental patients vocational training there.

From the time of the Great Depression until the formation of the New Zealand Rabbit Board in 1954, rabbits became a major pest in the area, and rabbiters were employed to keep the creatures under control. The trapping of rabbits and auctioning of their skins in Dunedin became a minor but important part of the Catlins area&#x27;s economy during this time.

The area&#x27;s population has declined from a peak of around 2,700 in 1926 to its current level of around 1,200. This decline has halted in recent decades, with 2008 figures being very similar to those of 1986.

== Natural history ==

=== Wildlife ===
The Catlins coast often hosts New Zealand fur seals and Hooker&#x27;s sea lions, and occasionally southern elephant seals can be seen. Several species of penguin also nest along the coast, notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin (&quot;hoiho&quot;), as do other seabirds including mollymawks and Australasian gannets, and the estuaries of the rivers are home to herons, stilts, godwits and oystercatchers. Bitterns and the threatened fernbird (&quot;mātātā&quot;) can also occasionally be seen along the reedy riverbanks.

In the forests, endangered birds such as the mōhua and kākāriki occur, as do other birds such as the tūī, pīwakawaka, and kererū. One of New Zealand&#x27;s only two native species of non-marine mammal, the long-tailed bat, lives in small numbers within the forests, and several species of lizard are also found locally, including the southern forest gecko.

Many species of fish, shellfish, and crustaceans frequent both the local rivers and sea, notably crayfish and pāua. Nugget Point in the northern Catlins hosts a particularly rich variety of marine wildlife. The establishment of a marine reserve off the coast here, discussed in 1992, 2004 and 2015, has been controversial. Hector&#x27;s dolphins can often be seen close to the Catlins coast, especially at Porpoise Bay near Waikawa, which is protected as part of the Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary, established in 2008. Migratory southern right whales and humpback whales can be spotted along the coastline during winter.

=== Flora ===
The Catlins features dense temperate rainforest, dominated by podocarps. This is the largest area of native forest remaining on the South Island&#x27;s east coast, with over of forest and neighbouring subalpine areas being protected in Catlins Conservation Park. The forest is thick with trees such as rimu (&quot;Dacrydium cupressinum&quot;), tōtara (&quot;Podocarpus totara&quot;), silver beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;), mataī (&quot;Prumnopitys taxifolia&quot;) and kahikatea (&quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;). Of particular note are the virgin rimu and tōtara forest remaining in those areas which were too rugged or steep to have been milled by early settlers, and an extensive area of silver beech forest close to the Takahopa River. This is New Zealand&#x27;s most southerly expanse of beech forest. Many native species of forest plant can be found in the undergrowth of the Catlins forest, including young lancewoods, orchids such as the spider orchid and perching Easter orchid, and many different native ferns.

Settlers cleared much of the Catlins&#x27; coastal vegetation for farmland, but in some areas the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges and some of the bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (&quot;Celmisia lindsayii&quot;) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand&#x27;s mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.

=== Geology ===
The geology of the Catlins dates back to over 150 million years ago, when the bedrock of the New Zealand continent was being assembled by thick sediments and volcanic arcs accreting onto the edge of the Gondwana supercontinent in a series of long thin terranes. The parallel hill ranges of the Catlins form part of the Murihiku terrane, which extends inland through the Hokonui Hills as far west as Mossburn. This itself forms part of a larger system known as the Southland Syncline, a fold system which links to similar formations in Tasman District (offset by the Alpine Fault), the North Island and even New Caledonia, away.

The north-eastern boundary of this geologic region is marked by the Murihiku escarpment, which runs along the southern edge of the dormant Hillfoot fault line. The Catlins ranges are strike ridges composed of Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, mudstones and other related sedimentary rocks, often with a high incidence of feldspar. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic Warepan and Kaihikuan stages are found in the area.

Curio Bay features the petrified remains of a forest 160 million years old. This represents a remnant of the subtropical woodland that once covered the region, only to become submerged by the sea. The fossilised remnants of trees closely related to modern kauri and Norfolk pine can be seen here.

== Population and demographics ==
The Catlins are partly in the Otago region and partly in Southland, and consequently are covered in two statistical areas. They cover and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Almost all of the Catlins&#x27; population lies either close to the route of the former state highway running from Balclutha to Invercargill (which now forms part of the Southern Scenic Route), or in numerous tiny coastal settlements, most of which have only a few dozen inhabitants.

The largest town in the Catlins, Owaka, had a population of 309 in the 2018 census. It is located southwest of Balclutha. The only other settlements of any great size are Kaka Point (population 231), Waikawa, Tokanui, and Fortrose, which lies at the western edge of the Catlins on the estuary of the Mataura River. Most of the area&#x27;s other settlements are either little more than farming communities (such as Romahapa, Maclennan, and Glenomaru) or seasonally populated holiday communities with few permanent residents (such as Papatowai or Pounawea). An outdoor education centre, run by the Otago Youth Adventure Trust is located at Tautuku, almost exactly halfway between Owaka and Waikawa.

===Catlins statistical area===
The Catlins statistical area, which includes the Catlins within the Otago region, covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Catlins had a population of 1,305 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 51 people (4.1%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 27 people (−2.0%) since the 2006 census.

== Economy ==
The early European economy of the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The exploitation of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with the rapid growth of the city of Dunedin as a result of the goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.

The land cleared of trees largely became pasture. From the 1880s, clearing of land for dairy farming increased, especially in the areas around Tahakopa and the Ōwaka River valley. Considerable sheep and dairy farming continues on the cleared hills on the periphery of the region, and this accounts for much of the Catlins&#x27; income. A rural polytechnic specialising in agricultural science (Telford Rural Polytechnic) is located south of Balclutha close to the northeastern edge of the Catlins.

Fishing and tourism now account for much of the area&#x27;s economy. The rugged natural scenery, sense of isolation, and natural attractions such as Cathedral Caves makes the Catlins a popular destination for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack&#x27;s Bay and Pounawea. Ecotourism is becoming increasingly important to the area&#x27;s economy, with many of the visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region&#x27;s economy in 2003.

== Transport ==
The Southern Scenic Route links Fiordland and Dunedin via the Catlins. Here it runs northeast to southwest as an alternative road to State Highway 1, which skirts the Catlins to the northwest. This section of the Southern Scenic Route—formerly designated State Highway 92 but no longer listed as a state highway—winds through most of the small settlements in the area, and was only completely sealed during the late 1990s (a stretch of about southwest of Tautuku was surfaced with gravel prior to that time). The settlements of Owaka, Maclennan, Papatowai, Tokanui, and Fortrose all lie on this route. A coastal route also parallels the inland highway between Waikawa and Fortrose, but only about two thirds of this road is sealed.

The remaining small roads in the district, all of which link with the former State Highway, have gravel surfaces. These roads mainly link the main route with small coastal settlements, although gravel roads also extend along the valleys of the Ōwaka and Tahakopa Rivers, linking the main Catlins route with the small towns of Clinton and Wyndham respectively. The gravelled Waikawa Valley Road crosses the hills to join the Tahakopa-Wyndham route.

Several of the area&#x27;s coastal settlements have facilities for small boats, but generally only fishing and holiday craft use them; no regular passenger or freight-boat service runs to the Catlins. A railway line, the Catlins River Branch, linked the area with the South Island Main Trunk Line from the late 19th century. Construction of this line began in 1879, but it did not reach Owaka until 1896. Construction progressed slowly due to the difficult terrain, and the final terminus of the line at Tahakopa was not completed until 1915.
The economic viability of the line declined with the sawmills that it was built to serve, and the line was eventually closed in 1971. Parts of the line&#x27;s route are now accessible as walkways, among them a long tunnel (&quot;Tunnel Hill&quot;) between Owaka and Glenomaru.

== Government ==
The Catlins forms part of the Clutha-Southland electorate in the New Zealand Parliament. Between 1996 and 2014, the electorate was represented by Bill English of the National Party, who was Prime Minister of New Zealand and a former Leader of the Opposition. The Catlins area is split between the Clutha and Southland Districts for local government purposes.

Most of the Catlins falls in the Clutha District, based in Balclutha, and one of the council&#x27;s fourteen representatives is elected directly from a Catlins Ward which is roughly coterminous with this area. The Clutha District is itself part of the Otago Region, controlled administratively by the Otago Regional Council (ORC) in Dunedin, to the northeast of Balclutha. The Molyneux Constituency of the ORC, which covers roughly the same area as the Clutha District, elects two councillors to the 12-member Regional Council.

Approximately the westernmost one-third of the Catlins area lies in the Southland District, based in Invercargill, to the west of Fortrose. One of the council&#x27;s 12 elected members represents the Toetoes Ward, which contains this part of the Catlins, along with an area around Wyndham and extending along Toetoes Bay towards the Awarua Plain. The Southland District is itself part of the Southland Region, controlled administratively by the Southland Regional Council (SRC; also known as &quot;Environment Southland&quot;), which is also based in Invercargill. The Southern Constituency of the SRC, which covers the entire Toetoes Ward and extends across the Awarua Plain almost as far as Bluff in the west and Mataura in the north, elects one councillor to the 12-member Regional Council.

==Education==
The Catlins area hosts four co-educational schools: Tahakopa School, Tokanui School, and Romahapa School, all of which are primary schools; The Catlins Area School, Owaka is a combined primary and secondary school. It is the only one of the four with more than 100 pupils. The nearest dedicated secondary schools are South Otago High School in Balclutha and Menzies College in Wyndham.

The nearest tertiary institution is Telford Rural Polytechnic, located at the edge of the Catlins at Otanomomo, south of Balclutha. Other than this, the nearest tertiary establishments are in Invercargill and Dunedin, the nearest university being the University of Otago in Dunedin.

==Medical services==
A hospital opened in Owaka in 1924, offering a decreasing range of services until its closure during the 1980s. The building and grounds now host a youth hostel and holiday park. Today, Owaka is served by a medical centre and a pharmacy. The Southern District Health Board is responsible for most publicly funded health services in Otago and Southland, including the Catlins.

The nearest hospital to most of the area is the community owned Clutha Health First, in Balclutha. There is another small hospital in Gore, a secondary level hospital in Invercargill, and a tertiary level hospital (Dunedin Hospital) in Dunedin. The last two are also university teaching hospitals.
